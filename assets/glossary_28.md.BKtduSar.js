It premiered on FOX on November 17, 2014 and was written by Ken Woodruff, and directed by Karen Gaviola. In this episode, trying to solve the Waynes' murder, Gordon (Ben McKenzie) allies with ADA Harvey Dent (Nicholas D'Agosto) while also investigating corruption in Gotham. The episode was watched by 6.49 million viewers, an improvement over the previous episode. It received generally positive reviews, with critics feeling Harvey Dent was \\"wasted\\".  Plot  James Gordon places Selina Kyle in custody in Wayne Manor as she is the only witness in the Waynes' murder. Meanwhile, a bomb maker, Ian Hargrove, is abducted by Russian mobsters led by Gregor Kasyanov while being transferred from Blackgate Penitentiary. The Russians plan on robbing a safe vault with the bombs he makes. Gordon, Renee Montoya and Crispus Allen meet with Assistant District Attorney Harvey Dent to discuss the Waynes' murder. After Gordon shows up a drawing from the killer stated by Selina, Dent deduces it may be Dick Lovecraft, a corrupt billionaire, as his fortune rose after their murders. Dent later interrogates Lovecraft, who denies any involvement in the crimes. When Lovecraft mocks Dent, Dent grabs Lovecraft and threatens him, showing signs of an unstable, second persona. Gordon and Harvey Bullock find Hargrove in the Gotham Munition Factory but they are ambushed by the Russians, who take away Hargrove. After making a test, Edward Nygma tells them the bombs are designed to break through iron. The Russians force Hargrove to blow up the Gotham Armory Basement so they can steal Carmine Falcone's money. While planning their getaway, Gordon and Bullock ambush them. As Hargrove walks toward them, the truck explodes when Butch Gilzean plants a call detonator. Oswald Cobblepot visits Liza, where he reveals he knows about her plan with Fish Mooney of taking out Falcone but promises to stay quiet. Hargrove is sent to Arkham Asylum. Alfred Pennyworth decides to let Selina stay for a while as she bonds with Bruce Wayne. In the final scene, while Gordon is trying to contact his fiance Barbara Kean after she left the city, it is revealed that she and Montoya have renewed their previously broken relationship.  Reception = Viewers = The episode was watched by 6.49 million viewers, with a 2.3 rating among 18-49 adults. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 10.26 million viewers, and a 4.0 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. = Critical reviews = \\"Harvey Dent\\" received generally positive reviews. The episode received a rating of 62% with an average score of 6.0 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"Despite a solid procedural plot -- and the introduction of Dent himself -- 'Harvey Dent' is mostly an uneventful episode that adds little to the overall story arc.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"okay\\" 6.8 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"I personally felt like the show had been on a bit of an upswing over the past few weeks, so I'm not sure what happened here. It wasn't all totally disposable, but there was a slight 'crash and burn' feel to it. The dialogue ‚Äì from Dent, Selina, and Nygma (taking about video games for no reason, not even case related) ‚Äì really stood out as being bad while Selina's message to Bruce about not being harsh enough for the streets fell flat since we'd just witnessed him beating another kid senseless last week.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade and wrote, \\"Nuance is by no means Gothams strong suit (and it doesn't always have to be), but compared to other episodes this season, there's a low-key confidence to the storytelling in 'Harvey Dent' that serves the characters and plot well, focusing on building tension and relationships while never really stepping into the territory of the ridiculous. The case-of-the-week is compelling, the mob power struggle continues to move in interesting directions, and we even get some wonderful development in terms of Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle. Gotham always takes on too much‚Äìtoo many characters, too many plot threads, too many references. 'Harvey Dent' doesn't. It‚Äôs economical, and all the better for it.\\"  References  External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:2014 American television episodes ","title":"Harvey Dent (Gotham episode)"},{"id":"49205760","text":"Jason Courtney Ralph (28 June 1872 ‚Äì 6 February 1952) was an Australian rules footballer who played with South Melbourne in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

When completed in 2016, it became the tallest sculpture in North America, surpassing Mexico's Guerrero Chimalli, which measures including its base. History Originally designed by Georgian sculptor Zurab Tsereteli as a monument to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's first voyage Birth of the New World was constructed in 1991. The statue prominently depicts Columbus controlling an anachronistic depiction of a steering wheel, with a backdrop featuring the Ni√±a, Pinta and Santa Mar√≠a traversing the Atlantic Ocean. Made of 2,750 bronze and steel pieces and weighting more than , the monument's height made it the tallest in the Western Hemisphere during the last decade of the 20th century, dwarfing the Statue of Liberty and the Monumento a la Paz (also known as Virgen de la Paz). Tsereteli offered Birth of the New World to the cities of Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, Miami Beach, New York City and Columbus, Ohio, but none of those cities accepted it, considering it an eyesore due to its disproportionate features or because its size would affect their skylines.' Amid its long search for a home, the statue gathered the derisive nicknames of \\"Chris Kong\\", \\"Robo-Columbus\\", and \\"From Russia with Ugh\\" while searching for a base. Despite the hindrances, the monument was featured in a stamp. A smaller and modified version, named The Birth of a New Man and meant to be the European link of a two-part composition along with Birth of the New World, was adopted by Seville, Spain, and dedicated there in 1995. There were plans for it to be erected in Catano, Puerto Rico. After a long effort, it was instead shifted to be erected in Acebo, Puerto Rico. =Search for a location=New York City In 1991, New York City was the first to be offered the statue. Tseretali proposed erecting the statue on Roosevelt Island. However, this plan was met with concerns of its size, as it visually would visually dwarf the Statue of Liberty, yet be dwarfed itself by skyscrapers of the city's skyline that sat near Roosevelt Island. Plans for it to be located New York City were briefly resurrected in 1997 when then-real estate developer Donald Trump proposed that the statue be at his development of rail yards, but this was nixed by city leadership including mayor Rudy Giuliani. Miami Beach In 1992, the Miami area was offered the statue, after financier and investor Bennett S. LeBow sought to see it erected at South Pointe in Miami Beach, near the Government Cut entrance of the Port of Miami. Supporters argued that it had the potential to become an icon for the City of Miami. The sculpture attracted local criticism, including for the fact that the design included a depiction of a ship's wheel, despite the fact that this device would not supplant the use of tillers for over 250 years after Columbus' first voyage to the Americas. Native American activist groups also expressed concern over a statue which celebrated a man who they regarded as a rapist and murderer. Plans to erect it in Miami ultimately failed due to the large costs associated with erecting the statue. Fort Lauderdale In 1992, as plans to locate it in Miami were fizzling out, Fort Lauderdale, Florida City Commissioner Gary Keno expressed interest in locating it in his city. The head of the sculpture was shipped to the city that year, in hopes of stoking support for erecting the statue there. Keno found little support for displaying the head in a city park. The head would ultimately remain in a warehouse there for six years. Native American activist groups again expressed concern. Columbus, Ohio In 1993, the city of Columbus, Ohio was offered the statue. Governor George V. Voinovich expressed interest, sending a letter of intent. Proponents argued that it could become an icon for the city, and would a tourist generator. The costs associated with erecting the statue, again, posed an issue. Mayor Greg Lashutka refused to spend any city funds on erecting the statue. Despite his support for the statue, Governor Voinovich stated that no state money was available to errect the statue. This would mean that citizens groups would be required to raise as much as $25 million for the statue to be erected in Columbus. Additionally, Native American activist groups again raised concern. The statute also met criticism for its massive size (it would stand approximately three stories shorter than the city's tallest building, the Rhodes State Office Tower) and criticisms that it would appear gaudy. St. Petersburg, Florida In 1995, Tsereteli sought to convince the city of St. Petersburg, Florida to become the home of his statue. However, his overtures were met with large disinterest by the city. Baltimore In 1997, there was an effort to locate the statue in Baltimore's Inner Harbor. Locations floated for the statue to be located in the Inner Harbor included Fort Carroll and the site of a former Allied Chemical plant on the east side of the Inner Harbor. Joseph DiCara, whose construction management firm would be responsible for assembling the statue if it were built in Baltimore, advocated for it to be erected in the city. Some other local businessmen, local Italian American community leaders, and politicians also lent their support. Supporters touted its potential as a tourist attraction. Mayor Kurt Schmoke was initially interested in the prospect of erecting the statue. However, his office also expressed concern over the city lacking resources to help finance its errection. Ivan Kazansky, the head of Moscow's Union of SCulptures, advised Baltimore against letting Tsereteli \\"ruin\\" their harbor. Additionally, concerns again arose over its size. Catano, Puerto Rico In 1998, Edwin \\"Amolao\\" Rivera Sierra, mayor of the municipality of Cata√±o in Puerto Rico, decided to acquire the monument. Despite being donated by Tsereteli, the cost of importing the statue was 2.4 million dollars, all of which was taken from the public treasury with the approval of governor Pedro Rossell√≥. Rivera Sierra insisted that the municipal treasury would not lose a single cent on the project, and planned to erect the monument near the entrance of Cata√±o Bay. The unassembled pieces of the statue were relocated to an adjacent recreational park upon arriving on 12 November 1998. In its original plan, construction would have begun in 1999, with the dedication taking place in October 2000. However, the project caused immediate controversy; several homes would have to be destroyed to make way for it and the cost of its assembly was deemed excessive with only the statue's base being estimated to be worth around 150 million dollars. The Oficina del Contralor (Office of the Comptroller) opened an investigation into the transaction and found that the 1.6 million dollars in taxes that were due when the statue entered the port were not paid. The auditor also investigated the use of public funds to cover the travel expenses of Rivera Sierra when personally meeting Tseretelli in Russia. The height of the monument raised concerns that it would interfere with air traffic to nearby Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n International Airport. Ultimately, the Puerto Rico Port Authority denied Cata√±o the permits required to advance, citing \\"security concerns\\". The central government decided to stop providing any funding for the project. The unassembled pieces remained stored near Cata√±o Bay for several years. Rivera Sierra's successor, Wilson Soto, declared that the municipality would not invest any public funds in the project. By this time, some of the pieces were beginning to show signs of rusting, and storing the pieces was costing $1.6 million in taxes per year, not including the salaries of several security guards. The municipality also lost an estimated income of $200,000 that the recreational park would have provided were it open to the public. The total cost of the project was re-estimated due to the necessity of replacing several parts and some of the supporting steel structures, fixing exposure damage and the additional need for a sandblasting procedure. In early 2005, Tseretelli began searching for developers that would take over the project. However, these efforts were interrupted by Soto, who considered that simply assembling the statue was not enough to attract tourism. He suggested that the entire area would need to be developed. The size of the project caused potential developers to lose interest. On 16 August 2008, the municipality confirmed that Birth of a New World had been transferred to Holland Group Port Investment (HGPI), a private group that was involved in the development of the Mayag√ºez port. Soto justified the action by claiming that simply storing the pieces was costing the public treasury 4 million dollars, and that Cata√±o could not afford a project that would exceed $100 million. The private entity transferred the pieces to its facilities in Mayag√ºez, announcing its intention to assemble the statue near the coastline in time for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games that were being held in that municipality. HGPI devised a plan to attract an estimated 500,000 tourists to with Birth of a New World as its cornerstone. A regional plan would include the establishment of a museum of history near the statue. The possibility of establishing a cruise route between Mayag√ºez and Seville was also explored. Once there, a Russian team examined the condition of the pieces and ensured that it could still be assembled. Finding a home in Arecibo, Puerto Rico HGPI was unable to fulfill its plan in time, citing disinterest by the municipal government, and the statue was reassigned for a different project. Arecibo became a frontrunner, and Mayor Lemuel Soto began the permit process for a project that would combine the statue with other attractions, such as the Arecibo Observatory. However, the municipality faced competition; Representative David Bonilla Cort√©s requested that the statue be assembled on Desecheo Island and the newly elected mayor of Cata√±o, Jos√© Rosario, proposed using the statue as part of an eco park that would be constructed in the swampy region of Ci√©naga las Cucharillas. San Juan also tentatively considered the project, but lost interest due to the condition of the pieces. Ultimately, Tseretelli decided that it was \\"too late\\" to consider other venues and settled for Arecibo. However, once there the monument faced more controversy, this time by activists that condemned Columbus' role in opening the door to the European genocide of indigenous peoples and by groups that opposed its impact in the maritime-terrestrial zone. Eventually, the Luis Fortu√±o administration began processing the respective permits. In 2012, Rosario denounced the Puerto Rico Department of Treasury for imposing nearly 3 million dollars in retroactive taxes for the original transaction and unfinished projects related to it, resulting in an embargo of the municipality's income. In June 2012, the first pieces began arriving at Barrio Islote in Arecibo. Birth of the New World became the main attraction of a tourist project called Columbus Theme Park (later renamed Terravista ParkLand) developed by Pan American Grain, which the administration expected would produce 4.6 million dollars in income per year and recruit 900 new employees. The assembly investment was now estimated at 98 million, with only the reclassification of the zone preventing the project's advance. This process was completed by January 2013. On 11 February 2014, a contemporary-Ta√≠no movement, named Movimiento Ind√≠gena J√≠baro Boricua, joined other anti-Columbus factions in protest the impending assembly of the monument. The monument survived the passing of Cat. 4 hurricane Maria in September 2017 without structural damage. However, the adjacent infrastructure was heavily affected. The remodeling of the beach house (which is expected to host the visitor center), as well as the construction of new roads, parking and a plaza were all halted. Reforestation efforts in the area were completely reverted after the winds decimated the flora. These developments forced architect Roberto Alsina to delay the timetable and reconsider strategies, this while working to undo the damage to the area that would host the Terravista ParkLand. =Tsereteli et al v. Gonz√°lez Freyre et al= Status of land development as of December 2019. On 14 March 2019, Tsereteli sued Gonz√°lez Freyre, Pan American Grain and Columbus Park Corporation, claiming that previous agreements had not been fulfilled as the sculptor's corporation -Birth of New World LLC- had not been refunded an investment of $17 million (for transferring it between Mayag√ºez and Arecibo) or received ownership of the terrains. This conflict prevented plans from fully opening to the public and prompted the municipality to change dates for the formal inauguration on multiple occasions. Tsereteli was stated to be content with the visibility gained by the monument and unconcerned by the possibility of it remaining closed off for the time being. During a year, beginning when a contract was signed in November 2013, both sides discussed the transfer of between and of the plot to an entity of the author's choosing. However, Gonz√°lez Freyre claims that Tsereteli did not discuss the matter again until he issued a warning in late 2018, after more than a year of no communication, and that the Russian artist did not heed attempts to mediate. As of March 2019, the monument is virtually complete but the development of the Terravista ParkLand had yet to begin following the hurricane delays and is expected to take up to five years. Economic impact Prior to the inauguration, an economic study by consulting firm Estudios T√©cnicos, estimated that the statue would attract at least 300,000 tourists per year to the municipality, with additional income from taxes related to the project. Shortly after its assembly was completed, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company labelled Birth of the New World a potential anchor attraction for the north region. In 2019, Carlos Molina stated that the increased traffic of people interested in seeing the monument had been the main motivator behind the opening of several new businesses in the municipality. The incumbent mayor considered that Birth of the New World had becomes ‚Äúa tourist attraction for the local and foreign visitor‚Äù. He quantified the economic impact as of 2020 at 1,000 new jobs, 100 businesses and 500 property acquisitions. The volume of people stopping along Puerto Rico Highway 22 to see the monument motivated a legislative bill to build a lookout and rest area.

He also produced two photographic books, Framed: Photographs of Australian Artists and All of Us, documenting the multicultural makeup of Australia. Early life and education Lawrence matriculated from Camberwell Grammar School in Melbourne and enrolled at La Trobe University in its first year, becoming the foundation editor of the student newspaper Rabelais. Career On leaving university, Lawrence began work as a journalist at the national daily newspaper, The Australian. At News Ltd, Lawrence worked for the Sunday Australian and The Sunday Telegraph as a political columnist covering both state and federal politics. After leaving The Australian in 1976, he founded and edited Australia's first skateboard magazine, Slicks. Lawrence was recruited to manage Australian electric folk group, The Bushwackers, departing in 1976 with the band for an extended 18-month tour of Europe including England, Scotland and Wales, and recording their album Murrumbidgee at Morgan's Studios, London. Returning to Australia in 1978, Lawrence founded the design studio Swell Productions which became the advertising agency Burrows Doble Lawrence, with Art Director Bill Burrows and agency Account Director Ed Doble. The agency was sold to D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles and Lawrence was headhunted to the Australian retail agency Mattingly and Partners as its Executive Creative Director. During this period he was also President of the Melbourne Art Directors‚Äô Club. In 1990, Lawrence was appointed Executive Creative Director of the multi-national agency J. Walter Thompson, eventually being appointed Managing Director of the Melbourne Office in 1998 and then Australian Chairman a year later. In 2001 while chairman of JWT, Lawrence was asked about the collapse of Australian airline Ansett, in the midst of a pitch for the airline's business. Lawrence told AdNews, \\"marketing and advertising were never the problems, and neither was ever going to solve deep-seated difficulties [at Ansett].\\" During a period of 10 years, Lawrence embarked on a personal project to photograph one hundred of Australia's most important postwar modernists including Sidney Nolan, Lloyd Rees, Arthur Boyd, Donald Friend, Sam Fullbrook, Jeffrey Smart, Elwyn Lynn, David Larwill and John Wolseley. This became an exhibition at Australian Galleries Melbourne and Sydney in 1996. Two years later the exhibition was published as the book, Framed: Photographs of Australian Artists, published by Hardie Grant. 'National Library of Australia catalogue' The book's cover portrait of Lloyd Rees had previously been a cover of the Sydney Morning Herald/Age magazine \\"Good Weekend\\", illustrating an article on the artist by Janet Hawley winning her a Walkley Award. Hawley also contributed the introduction to the book Framed. Lawrence's second book, All of Us includes photographs of people born in 200 other countries, but who were now living in Australia.http://www.photoreview.com.au/stories/profiles/michel-lawrence-all- for-one The project was inspired by the 2005 Cronulla riots. All of Us was published by Scribe Books and the portraits exhibited at Federation Square, Melbourne and later in a tour of Indian cities. The 'All of Us' project was launched at Federation Square by the Victorian Premier, John Brumby for Australia Day 2008 and was funded by Federal and State governments along with private benefactors. A subsequent project, 'Indian Aussies' was commissioned by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and has been touring India after its launch in New Delhi in 2013. Lawrence's photographs are held in numerous private and public collections, including The National Portrait Gallery in Canberra, The National Library in Canberra, The Queensland Art Gallery (QAGOMA),http://blog.qagoma.qld.gov.au/sam-fullbrook-delicate-beauty/ The Museum of Modern Art at Heide, Melbourne University and a number of regional galleries across Australia. Lawrence's collection of photographs of Australian musicians, actors and performers is in the permanent collection of the Melbourne Performing Arts Museum.http://collections.artscentremelbourne.com.au/paminter/imu.php?request=browse&irn;=2988 In 2012, Lawrence's production company Miro Filmshttp://mirofilms.tv began producing the television arts program InsideArt,http://insideart.tv which has run four seasons across Australian public broadcasters in Melbourne, Sydney and Perth.

It is used to form the bilayer of the membrane. Cubosomes are discrete, sub- micron, nanostructured particles of the bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline phase. The term \\"bicontinuous\\" refers to two distinct hydrophilic regions separated by the bilayer. Bicontinuous cubic crystalline materials have been an active research topic because their structure lends itself well to controlled-release applications. Cubosomes are liquid crystalline nano- structures formed from the cubic phase of lipids, such as monooleate, or any other amphiphilic macromolecules with the unique property to be dispersed into particles. Nano-vehicles are generated from a self-assembled lipid mixture and studied by means of high-resolution cryogenic transmission electron microscope (cryo-TEM). These structures have been observed to naturally occur in mitochondrial membranes and in stressed cells. Cubosomes are formed at controlled temperatures into lipid bi-layer twisted into three dimension with minimal surface forming a tightly packed structure with bicontinuous domains of water and lipid. There are three different proposed phases that these cubic structures can be in: the P-surface, G-surface and D-surface for primitive, gyroid and diamond structures respectively. This variation in structure allows for cubosomes to be the ultimate drug delivery system due to its ability to maintain the structural integrity of the ingredients that it carries. The uses of cubosomes are still being researched but they range from systems for efficient drug delivery into specific body systems to stabilizing and producing palladium nanoparticles.  Uses  For most fluids and some homogenous solid materials, like gels, diffusion is the same in all directions and characterized by the same diffusion coefficient number. This property is called isotropicity which gives cubosomes the ability to be used in biological tissues which are highly structured and typically have different diffusion coefficients along different directions (anisotropic). Because of advantages such as the unique structure of the cubic phase and its resemblance to biological membranes as well as biodegradability of lipids, cubosomes are a great tool for drug delivery system. In addition, the bicontinuous cubic liquid crystalline phase (cubic phase)‚Äôs tortuosity is useful for slowing down diffusion as shown by Higuchi‚Äôs square root of time release kinetics. Capability to encapsulate hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and amphiphilic substance, being simple to prepare, and all the aforementioned qualities give cubosomes a property that can be used in controlled transport applications as drug delivery vehicles.

Molecular data later supported the genus concept. Inocutis is phylogenetically close to Fomitiporella. Description Inocutis species produce annual fruit bodies. They are characterized by the absence of setae, the presence of a rudimentary granular core, and the presence of sclerified hyphae in the granular core. They have yellowish to brownish spores that are ellipsoid in shape, and non-dextrinoid. The hyphal system is monomitic, consisting of only generative hyphae. They all grow on deciduous substrates.

Starred by Nin√≥n Sevilla and Armando Silvestre. Plot In a little fisher's village in the Papaloapan River lives the fisher Pedro (Andr√©s Soler) and his two daughters Rita (Nin√≥n Sevilla) and Martha (Rosenda Monteros). Rita loves a young man named Jos√© (Armando Silvestre) who has been fired from a sugar mill for organizing a strike. So, he and Rita can't marry soon. After a good fishing, all in the town celebrate a party. But Don Antonio (Julio Villarreal), the owner of the sugar mill, comes to collect Pedro the money that he lent him for a boat. As Pedro can't pay him, Don Antonio asks as pay to one of his daughters. Rita listens and she decides to go with Don Antonio to save her father and her sister. Before leaving, Rita makes love with Jos√©. When she leaves, Jos√© thinks that she has left him.

The result was good: Take Me in Your Arms is a film that has grown over time as Adventuress, Victims of Sin and Sensuality. The film, which was shot with the binomial Nin√≥n-Bracho, is a melodrama of bitter family feuds and vendettas, by a filmmaker on the crest of the wave, in the height of his success. There is everything: landowners, fishermen, sinister union leaders, impossible love; a young lady deceived and sexually abused. The whole conflict was dominated by great personalities: Carlos Lopez Moctezuma, Andrea Palma, Rodolfo Acosta, Andr√©s Soler and Ninon Sevilla as an ingenuous young girl dragged by a whirlwind of calamities.

Early efforts to address the spread of HIV were thwarted by poor organization and a lack of resources. By the early 2000s, the AIDS epidemic in Lesotho had grown to alarming proportions and the death rate had skyrocketed. The public was inadequately informed about how the disease spread and how transmission could be prevented. As the infection and death rate grew, stigmatization and discrimination of the ill grew too. Though government programs were being designed to address this health crisis, mobilization of the resources to implement the programs was lagging. Non- government organizations (NGOs) and foreign government programs were bringing aid, but almost 90% of Lesotho's population was scattered in remote rural areasIrish Aid: Connecting Health Research in Africa and Ireland Consortium (ChRAIC), Knowledge Synthesis Report, 2010 that were difficult to reach and often out of range of aid programs. New strategies were needed to reach the affected people. 2002 ‚Äì 2007 Mobilization The Saint Camillus Centre began in 2002 when a collaborative effort among a coalition of Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross, the Ministries of Health and Agriculture, and NGOs such as Irish Aide began a grass roots effort to address the rising number of Basotho suffering from AIDS related illnesses. The number of PLWHA in Lesotho had skyrocketed to 240,000; adult prevalence was over 30%, and the death toll was well over 25,000. Sister Baptista, of the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross in the nation's capital of Maseru was involved with newly forming HIV/AIDS support efforts. Her fellow organizers knew that to be successful the efforts would need the leadership and coordination skills of the Congregation and so Sister Baptista decided to appoint a Sister from the Congregation to attend the intensive workshops and become knowledgeable in the care and treatment of HIV/AIDS patients in the Mohale's Hoek District. True to the spirit of the Congregation's mission to reach out to those suffering, Sister Juliana Manele accepted Sister Baptista's assignment in spite of her lack of knowledge about HIV/AIDS and, with Sister Prisca's endorsement; she became the representative of the Sisters of the Holy Cross in this effort. The first step was to learn about the cause, treatment, and prevention of HIV/AIDS and she so attended extensive workshops organized through the collaborative efforts of Sister Prisca, the Ministry of Agriculture, and non-government organizations (NGOs). ‚ÄúI knew as soon as I heard about the need to care for the ill and dying and bring HIV/AIDS education to the villages that this was my mission, this is what I needed to do. I could never go back to work inside the convent when I knew there were people in the villages that needed someone to love, care, and comfort them.‚Äù (Sister Juliana)Memoirs from Sister Juliana, volunteers, and staff are captured in italics. The personal identities of children and PLWHA have been anonymized. With this newly acquired knowledge the coalition determined that enlisting the support of local communities was critical to the effort and that communication and training were essential as the public was ill-informed about HIV/AIDS and the meager health facilities were being overwhelmed by the numbers of ill and dying. Community in Action As the village chiefs advocated for this cause, villagers began to step forward to volunteer for the role of home based caregiver and present themselves for training. The Ministry of Health began conducting workshops for community members in the rural and semi-rural areas of Mohale's Hoek. Community volunteers would often walk miles to attend the workshops and learn the necessary techniques for caring for AIDS patients. Sister Juliana began visiting those suffering from AIDS and supporting the efforts of the newly trained volunteers in their remote villages. She walked or travelled on horseback to reach the afflicted in the remote mountain villages such as Leroto, Borutsa, Ketane, Monyameng, Qhobeng, Maphutseng, and Phamong. She would typically spend a week in each village, sleeping on the floor of caregivers‚Äô or patients‚Äô rondavels and cottages. During this time she became convinced that properly supported community based efforts would be successful to care for the PLWHA; to wash their wounds, feed them, and provide education and emotional support to them and their families. Sister Juliana, through her visits and support, became a role model to the volunteer caregivers in providing hope and dignity to those patients who were shunned by their family and friends and were left feeling shamed, neglected, and alone. During this time (2002-2004), a young Peace Corps Volunteer from the United States of America, Lewis ‚ÄúWeej‚Äù Mudge, was serving in Mohale's Hoek and joined Sister Juliana's efforts to transform the vision of well-trained home based caregivers into a reality. As government funds and support began to diminish, they pushed forward with a program of workshops both in the remote villages and on the grounds of St. Patrick's Church. Weej Mudge and Sister Juliana traveled throughout the Mohale's Hoek district, often walking or on horseback, to conduct the workshops and inspire new volunteers. At the onset, the training focused on providing direct patient care such as bathing, cleaning wounds, and feeding as well as teaching HIV prevention and offering some housekeeping. As the fledgling program matured and the numbers of caregivers and supporters gained experience and grew, Sister Juliana, Weej Mudge, and Bishop Sebastian formalized the program in 2004 with a constitution and an executive board. The Centre was registered as an NGO, the St. Camillus HIV/AIDS Home Based Care Centre.The Constitution of St. Camillus was approved by the Registrar General on August 25, 2004; Societies Registrar, Maseru, Registration #2004/145 The Centre's inspiration came from St. Camillus, the patron saint for the very ill and for those unfortunates who were shunned because of their illness. The constitution defined the mission of the Centre as being an ‚ÄúHIV/AIDS organization dedicated to education and home based care.‚Äù To support the new Centre, Bishop Sebastian donated a house on the grounds of St. Patrick's Church that would provide a permanent setting for workshops, support groups, and gatherings. He also donated land for a demonstration farm in 2004. The Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross in both Lesotho and Germany contributed significantly during this period. They supported the efforts of the new Centre by donating funds in addition to collecting and distributing food and clothing to those in need. As the program grew and more volunteer caregivers were added, the training expanded to provide a more holistic approach to living with HIV/AIDS. Trainers from various Lesotho government Ministries (Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, Ministry of Agriculture, Ministry of Social Development), the Police Department's Child and Gender Protection Unit (CGPU), and other supporting organizations (such as Irish Aid, CARE-Lesotho, Lesotho AIDS Programme Coordinating Authority (LAPCA), Christian Council of Lesotho, Lesotho Planned Parenthood Association) expanded the program to include: counseling in good nutrition; breaking down stigma and discrimination; protecting the rights of orphans, vulnerable children and women; applying gardening techniques; as well as teaching HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Irish Aid provided funds for the Centre to conduct Home Based Care workshops in the villages and at the Centre. The new volunteers trekked from their remote villages to attend the workshops and learn the essentials of caring for those suffering from AIDS. At the workshops they received Home Care Kits filled with medical supplies (gloves, anti-bacterial soap, bleach, Tylenol) donated by Irish Aid. In addition, special workshops were created for out-of-school youth, unwed mothers, and pregnant youth. The caregivers, patients infected with HIV, those affected by HIV/AIDS, and the youth group members all became part of the Centre's Support Group for PLWHA. Community health care professionals, such as Dr. Manamolela and Dr. Monyamane, also joined the effort by providing free medical and dental care and training. ‚ÄúWe created a St. Camillus Home Care Refresher course for caregivers trained over the past year. The training was organized into four sessions for the ninety-six caregivers who attended. The refresher was the first of its kind in Mohale‚Äôs Hoek and quite possibly the first in the country. We were able to collect the supplies necessary to refill the caregivers Home Care Kits which the caregivers had been sharing; stretching supplies so that one kit could be shared amongst five patients which was really an amazing feat. Refilling the kits was a local and a national problem that no one had yet found a solution to. The St. Camillus team was determined to find a way to keep the Care Kits stocked.‚Äù (Maria Steele, Peace Corps Volunteer) The efforts were not without significant issues and setbacks but the Congregation and Sister Juliana's team pushed forward to resolve the obstacles. By the end of 2003 Sister Juliana reported to the Ministry of Social Development the amazing progress: twenty-seven villages had over one hundred home based caregivers receiving support from the Centre. Through the efforts of the Centre and the caregivers, almost three hundred orphans had been identified for support services, two hundred patients were being cared for, while one hundred and fifty village members had died of AIDS related illnesses. Expanding services In 2004 the Lesotho government introduced new care services to its citizens. Free HIV counseling and testing began in March 2004 with the ‚ÄúKnow Your Status‚Äù program and in November 2004 free antiretroviral therapy (ART) was offered to the public.World Health Organization, 2005, ‚ÄúSummary Country Profile for HIV/AIDS Treatment Scale-UP‚Äù The government also planned to train 3,600 community health workers to provide HIV counseling and testing, though just over seven hundred had been identified by October 2006. With severely limited numbers of health care professionals and significant challenges to reaching remote villages, only about 8,400 HIV positive Basotho were on ART by the end of 2005 and only 2% of the target population had been tested for HIV by August 2007.Human Rights Watch, 2008 ‚ÄúWe entered the home of a young woman during one of our visits to the rural villages. She was lying in bed, a mat on the floor, covered up, so I could only see her head and hands. The sharp angle of her bones poking through the blanket was striking. She told us she was very weak and getting weaker every day. We encouraged her to go to the AIDS Clinic for a CD-4 test to see if she qualified for anti-retroviral treatment. She seemed interested and but needed the help of her sister with whom she lived.‚Äù (Maria Steele, Peace Corps Volunteer) However, St. Camillus continued its grass roots work with the community and expanded its services in the Mohale's Hoek district. With access to free ART and with the involvement of the growing number of home based caregivers the Centre coordinated the provision of free HIV/AIDS medications, free HIV testing, and free counseling to Support Group members at the St. Clare Clinic in Thoteng, Mohale's Hoek. Youth training programs were expanded to include life skills, self-reliance, and goal setting to help youth better prepare for a healthy and productive future. New workshops focusing on income- generating activities were introduced. Between 2004 and 2006, Peace Corps volunteer Maria Steele was working part-time at the Centre and was active in the training programs and assisting with home visits in addition to her duties with the Lesotho AIDS Programme Coordinating Authority (LAPCA). Knowing that ongoing, on-site assistance would be beneficial, Sister Juliana enlisted Maria Steele to write and submit a proposal to the Lesotho Peace Corps office for a full-time volunteer to start in 2005. The Peace Corps responded and Zoe Malley Krusic was assigned to St. Camillus 2005-2007. Thanks to Zoe Krusic's work in creating and submitting proposals, the Centre was awarded numerous grants. The United States government's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) program, USAID, and Irish Aid all made significant contributions to the St. Camillus effort to support HIV positive patients and orphans and vulnerable children (OVC). The Support Group began aloe jelly production with the assistance of the Cooperatives Division of the Ministry of Agriculture. The aloe business provided new cottage industry and business management skills to the volunteers. The small plot that had originally served as a demonstration garden was expanded into the ‚Äúfarm‚Äù that produced a variety of vegetables and fruits, as well as producing fresh eggs from a well-stocked coop of poultry layers. The farm supplied nutritious food to PLWHA and OVC. Volunteers on the farm trained others in agriculture techniques, sales, and nutrition. Both the aloe jelly and excess produce were sold to the public and the profits re- invested in the Centre. The Centre was then able to fund community income- generating activities in the villages such as piggeries, chicken coops, crocheting, knitting, and jewelry making. Funds from the income-generating activities and donors were also used to provide food, seeds, seedlings, medical and dental care, and transportation costs (patients coming/going to the hospital and clinics) for those in need. Caregiver training and refresher courses were enhanced and enabled the volunteers to expand their services to the PLWHA. Counseling and information sharing were provided to address important issues: a new HIV positive diagnosis; emotional, financial, inheritance, and legal needs; orphan and women's rights; and rape and abuse. Information about government aid programs were added or enhanced to the support provided to the PLWHA. The Centre was able to facilitate efforts to establish food security measures for patients in the villages. The CARE Lesotho program provided training on building keyhole gardens The keyhole garden was designed to make raising vegetables less taxing for those who are physically weakened. The garden is built to be tended by someone standing rather than stooping and the entire surface area can be reached from any edge. for HIV/AIDs patients, which made gardening less physically demanding and provided important nutrients to their diets. The Netherlands Lesotho Foundation supported the creation of chicken coops for egg production and piggeries for meat production which improved the protein in patients‚Äô diets, and excess products could be sold to generate a small income. The Centre also reached out to the Mohale's Hoek Prison and arranged lectures by the Nutrition Officer from Ministry of Agriculture on nutrition and gardening. The Centre, with assistance from Peace Corps volunteer Zoe Malley Krusic, also facilitated monthly lectures and workshops on health, hygiene, and HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. A prisoners‚Äô support group was established to provide counseling and build skills in problem solving and re-socializing into the community upon release. By 2007, 40 prisoners had established their own herb and vegetable garden to improve the diets of the HIV positive inmates. To ensure the Centre remained current on HIV/AIDS research, Sister Juliana continued to attend workshops in Lesotho, South Africa, and Malawi. The latest knowledge, such as preventing mother to child HIV transmission, was continuously incorporated into caregiver training. As the caregivers became increasingly skilled, the Centre facilitated the maturing of the Support Group. The Group hosted HIV positive individuals who came to talk about their lives for the first time in public. Their brave candor and heartfelt stories enlightened the caregivers and enhanced their skill effectiveness in working with PLWHA. Group members were able to share their own stories and sorrows in caring for the critically ill in their communities. To honor the suffering and the caregivers, the Centre hosted an annual Festival of Light event to pray for all those who perished with AIDS related deaths, those suffering with the disease, and those affected by HIV/AIDS. Though the annual death rate gradually dropped from a high of 29,000 in 2003 to 18,000 in 2007,Data from IndexMundi, Avert.org (www.avert.org/hiv-aids-lesotho.htm#sthash.TUZpuOTz.dpuf) the number of PLWHA remained at 320,000 from 2004 through 2007 . The impact of the disease extended to the children of those affected and the plight of orphaned and abandoned children demanded attention. In the first quarter of 2005, the Centre reported finding almost 300 OVC residing in the 39 villages attended by home based caregivers; that number more than doubled by early 2007. The caregivers reported an increasing number of child headed households; children were fending for themselves and often taking care of younger siblings. Sister Juliana and the Centre responded by implementing programs to meet their special needs. Focus on the Children By 2005-2007, approximately 39 villages and well over 120 caregivers were actively involved in the Centre's activities. The Centre trained these caregivers to identify children at risk, to provide counseling when needed, and to make referrals to the Ministry of Social Development and the Police Department's Children and Gender Protection Unit (CGPU). The home based caregivers were in a unique position to identify OVC because they were community based and had firsthand knowledge of the living conditions and hardships that PLWHA and OVC faced. The caregivers were alert to the children's needs as the parents‚Äô health declined due to AIDS related illnesses and subsequent death. The volunteers informed the CGPU of children who were at risk and required an alternative living environment. ‚ÄúWe arranged to visit a small mountain village and came upon three small children who looked so dirty and hungry. We entered the house only to find their mother was still in bed with a cover over her shoulders. It appeared she had been dead for several days but the children were just too young and frightened to understand. The caregiver brought the children to the Chief and an extended family in a nearby village was found to care for them.‚Äù (Sister Juliana) The Congregation of the Holy Sisters in both Germany and Lesotho were committed to the children's well-being and made significant contributions over the years that help provide the rent, food, clothing, and tuition that enabled many OVC to remain in school. The Centre facilitated the delivery of these items from the Congregation to needy children. The Centre also provided a link to the Ministry of Health and Social Development and the Ministry of Social Development to help the OVC receive the appropriate level of services offered by the Ministry such as placement in a foster home or orphanage when necessary and available. The Centre also expanded youth training programs in response to requests from caregivers who were noticing increasing rates of AIDS related deaths among young adults. In spite of the hardships faced by the PLWHA and the OVC, the Centre and Support Group found ways for all to recognize there was much to be thankful for. In 2004 the Centre began a yearly tradition of hosting an Orphan's Feast with over one hundred OVC attending. The children, families, sponsors, and caregivers enjoyed great meals, dancing, singing, and skits, as well as kind words and gifts from Bishop Sebastian Khoarai, Sister Juliana, Sister Isidora Damane, the Sister Provincial of the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross, and other community notables who had come to share in the festivities. 2008 ‚Äì 2015 Transformation: challenges and successes National and international aid efforts to address the HIV/AIDs crisis continued to increase and millions of dollars in aid were being channeled into Lesotho's health and economic development programs. In spite of the challenges that Lesotho had in implementing these programs, successes included growing numbers of Basotho being voluntarily tested for HIV, improvements in prenatal care for HIV positive women, reduction in ‚Äúmaternal to child transmission‚Äù rates, increased numbers of individuals receiving ART, and expanded HIV counseling services and educational programs. The HIV/AIDS mortality and morbidity statistics showed some improvements but the overall metrics were sobering. In 2003, there were 360,000 Basotho estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS. By the end of 2008, that figure dropped to 320,000; however it only dropped to 290,000 by 2012. Adult prevalence was 28.9% in 2003, and 23.6% in 2009; it still hovered at 23% in 2012.2012 United Nations General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) With the Basotho battling HIV/AIDs, tuberculosis, and poverty, life expectancy was in the forty's. The United Nations reported that in 2011 the average life span was forty-eight years, a small improvement over the 2006 estimate of forty-six years.UNDP (2011), ‚ÄòHuman Development Report 2011‚Äô However, with the introduction and improved accessibility of ART and the increasing number of Basotho opting for voluntary HIV testing, the annual death rate from AIDS related illnesses dropped from 29,000 in 2003 to 14,000 in 2009. In 2011, 35% of adults had been voluntarily tested for HIV within the prior year.UNAIDS 2012, Global Report 2012: AIDS Info With the high prevalence of HIV/AIDS and prolonged years of high death rates, the impact on children was staggering. USAID estimates that as of April 2014 there were 350,000 orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in Lesotho, of which 180,000 were due to AIDS. Lesotho was found to have the highest number of single (one parent) or double (both parents) orphans in countries where the incidence of HIV/AIDs was at least 1%.UNICEF (2008), ‚ÄòChildren and AIDS: Third Stocktaking Report, 2008‚Äô Enhanced Home-based care The roles of the home based caregivers shifted to meet the needs of the changing health status of their village population. As more HIV/AIDS patients began ART, the caregivers provided more care and education related to improving overall physical and emotional health, stamina, and productivity. The caregivers continued to extend and enhance their role in their communities in large part due to the ongoing training they received from St. Camillus Centre. Training continued to expand and change to fit the needs and capabilities of the caregivers and their communities. On-going training enabled caregivers to increase their skills in counseling, health, HIV prevention, AIDS treatment, laws and rights pertaining to OVC and women, gardening, nutrition, and services provided by Lesotho Ministries. The Centre established a ‚Äútrain the trainer‚Äù program where representatives from each participating village would attend a formal training at the Centre and then return to their village to train other caregivers. With structure and advice from St. Camillus, the caregivers established their own support groups to transfer knowledge among themselves about home care, income- generating activities, and food security. They gathered to discuss difficult issues, share advice; and provide emotional support to each other. The groups prepared status reports, first monthly and then quarterly. The reports were used by the Centre to share successes and challenges and to ensure that government and aid groups received the information required for on-going support. The caregivers would use their reports to provide feedback to the Centre and government agencies on their needs, concerns, and recommendations for improvement. The Centre conducted regular site visits to meet with the caregivers and to meet with village chiefs and leaders as needed, provide follow up training to the caregivers, and to join the caregivers in visiting OVC and PLWHA to assess how well the programs were meeting their needs. The Centre often included cooking and food preservation demonstrations for the villages so that all could learn important techniques for improving food security and nutritional status. In more recent years, the Centre continued to sponsor quarterly or yearly workshops, training, and meetings to ensure caregiver skills remained sharp and their knowledge was keeping pace with current trends. The St. Camillus Centre was still used as a centre for training caregivers and PLWHA in income-generating activities such as the production of aloe jelly, jewelry, and other crafts. Shawna Cain, a Peace Corps volunteer (2012-2014), facilitated a work group called Mountains of Hope through early 2014 that produced crafts that were sold both locally and in the United States. The home based caregivers facilitated the building of over 1,000 keyhole gardens, identifying and assisting hundreds of OVC, and facilitating health care for patients receiving treatment for HIV and/or TB. They were a critical link to the Centre to refer critical cases needing attention and, in the case of OVC, sometimes the prompt intervention of the Children and Gender Protection Unit to remove a child from a dangerous or unhealthy living situation. Meeting the Needs of Special Children The goal of the Lesotho government, its people, and the St. Camillus Centre is to support nuclear and extended families in caring for their children in their own homes. To substantiate this, UNICEF reported that in 2008, almost half of all Basotho homes had at least one single or double orphan. As the home based caregivers continued to gain skill and independence the St. Camillus Centre increasingly shifted focus to meet the immediate needs of children at risk and who required a safe and nurturing environment. From its inception and increasingly so over the years St. Camillus took special notice of children in need and made every attempt to provide food, clothing, and access to education and health care. It also offered loving, nurturing interactions with members of the St. Camillus staff, volunteers, caregivers and Support Group members. The number of home based children, those living with extended families, which needed and received assistance from St. Camillus, grew each year. The Centre reached out to various community schools to allow enrollment at reduced or waived fees; the Centre also found clinics that would provide health care to the children even when there were no funds. The Centre created new ways to provide a nurturing environment by bringing children to the farm to experience the joy of being with productive adult role models. They were able to perform some of the fun and simple tasks on the farm such as gathering eggs, feeding the pigs, and collecting fresh vegetables. ‚ÄúI spent the day helping Sister Juliana deliver ground maize to area homes in need. House after house had very sad situations but the last house of the day was a real heart-breaker. A grandfather is caring for seven grandkids as he is dying of AIDS. His four adult children and his wife have already died leaving him alone with the kids, all under twelve. He has some neighbors that are trying to help but they have their own struggles.Everyone we visited was grateful for the food and happy to see Sister. She is one of the few people willing to visit them in their homes as she tries to sort out what else she can do to help each situation.‚Äù (Linda Henry, RPCV Lesotho, The Lesotho Connection Board Member). As the Lesotho government slowly increased its capacity to address the needs of OVC, the Centre has worked with the Ministries to shift the responsibility of care from the Centre to the appropriate Ministry. The numbers of home based OVC has gradually diminished from triple digits to approximately twenty at the beginning of 2014. However, the situation for some children became so dire that in 2008 Sister Juliana made arrangements to provide day care or temporary foster care to orphaned or abandoned children awaiting placement with appropriate family members. Against all odds, Sister Juliana found a way to overcome financial and logistical obstacles to create a simple but loving home for these children. With the Centre's reputation for providing care and support to those in need and it's collaborative relationship with the Ministry of Social Development and CGPU, more children made their way to the open door of the St. Camillus Centre. St. Juliana accepted all children in need, and soon the Centre was one of the few in Lesotho accepting infants along with HIV positive children. In 2011, the Centre officially revised its Constitution and was registered as the St. Camillus Orphans and Vulnerable Children, Day-Care and Fostering Center.The Constitution of St. Camillus was approved by the Registrar General on June 20, 2011; Societies Registrar, Maseru, Registration #2011/166 ‚ÄúA week ago another child was brought to the Centre. A little two- year-old boy named Bokang. He had been neglected and was very malnourished with a big tummy, yellow jaundiced eyes, chronic diarrhea and wispy hair. His mother deserted him and left him with a mentally ill father who was unable to care for him. The police picked him up wandering the streets of Mohale‚Äôs Hoek alone at night. He could barely walk and was mostly only able to crawl. Adding another child, especially one that was sick and not potty trained was a definite strain on our Caretaker, ‚ÄòMe Makatiso. On top of this, we have not had much water. When consulted about taking the child, Makatiso was in favor, in fact almost insisted. She is overworked but she has a huge heart for kids. We‚Äôll get some food into Bokang and see what we can do.‚Äù (Linda Henry, RPCV Lesotho, The Lesotho Connection Board Member). In the early years of caring for OVC, the Centre did its best to care for the children with the meager funds it had; but there was never a steady, guaranteed stream of income. Eggs, vegetables, and occasionally pork from the farm were brought to the Centre for the children's meals. The Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross, now led by Sister Gertrude, contributed monetary donations when they could, and this enabled the Centre to supply clothing, additional food, and supplies to the OVC. The Centre encouraged local health clinics and schools to offer free or discounted services. ‚ÄùThe CGPU gave me only fifteen minutes to know that they were on their way to deliver little Karabo to the Centre very late one night. I just put a big coat on over my nightgown, grabbed the keys, and drove over. He was a robust fourteenth month old but the look of terror in his eyes was unforgettable. He had been in police custody for a full day after being found near a river; a villager was passing by and heard his forlorn weeping. His mother had abandoned him; she left him alone and exposed. He appeared so well cared for, so plump and well dressed. What could have happened to that poor mother to feel so alone and incapable of caring for her lovely son? We still have Karabo at the Centre. He is healthy and playful but still has a sad little look in his eyes.‚Äù (Sister Juliana) As with other successful programs developed by the Congregation and Sister Juliana, the word soon spread that St. Camillus had implemented a new and impressive program. Interested donors from various parts of the world learned of the Centre and offered limited, intermittent cash or goods such as food and clothing. The Lesotho Connection (originally named Tacoma Lesotho Connection); a private charitable organization founded by former Lesotho Peace Corps volunteers, soon heard of St. Camillus and made a visit to the Centre in 2008. A deep and committed relationship between the two organizations was soon forged. Shelter for children The Lesotho Connection (TLC) was inspired by Manele's and the Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross‚Äô determination to care for the ever-growing number of children using only the humble resources they had. Through their dedication and hard work, TLC was able to conduct numerous successful fund-raising events and slowly build the capital to create a new vision for the future of the St. Camillus Centre. The priority was to build a children's home that would provide a safe and comfortable environment for the children and their matrons. The Centre was only able to provide two small bedrooms for the ever-growing number of children and matrons to share. A bigger home was needed. After several years of planning, fundraising, and praying, TLC acquired sufficient funds to guarantee that a new children's home could be built. One of their board members, Linda Henry, a former Lesotho Peace Corp volunteer in the 1980s, came to live at the Centre for six months between 2013 and 2014 to find a contractor and get the work started. Ground was broken in early 2014 on a small pasture at the farm that was previously leased to St. Camillus by Khoarai (retired 2014). Construction continued up until the fourth quarter of 2014. The Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross contributed the funding necessary to make the new structure a home for the children; they bought sheets and blankets for the new beds and the supplies to complete the finishing touches such as paint as plaster. Once completed as designed, seventeen children, ages twelve months to seventeen years, and four matrons moved in on December 23, 2014. The children's home has two large dorms, two private rooms with baths for the matrons, two large bathrooms in each dorm, and a large central kitchen and common area. The grounds outside have raised garden beds for flowers and vegetables, numerous young fruit and nut trees as well as wind-breaker trees along the perimeter. In addition there is a small plaza in front and an open area for the children to play. The home is surrounded by the farm's vegetable gardens and only a short walk from the peach orchard, chicken coops, and other domestic animals. Vision St. Camillus will be a sustainable organization that serves as a model for excellence in fostering compassion and inspiring individuals to achieve their health, educational, and economic goals. Mission St. Camillus reaches out to those who are feeling abandoned, vulnerable and stigmatized and provides love, education, a supportive environment, and economic resources that enable individuals to achieve a happy, healthy, and productive life. Goals The St. Camillus goals are to: 1\\\\. Provide a warm and safe shelter, for orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) to keep them healthy, well-nourished, protected from abuse, and receiving the education they need while awaiting placement in an appropriate home. 2.Provide income- generating opportunities for people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and at risk groups to help them achieve independent and productive lives. 3.Provide guidance and education to the home based caregivers to support their ongoing care of PLWHA and OVC including preventing HIV transmission, adhering to antiretroviral therapy, and improving overall health & wellness.

Discussions focused on various world issues, especially the Middle East and the Iranian political crisis.  Meeting  A month before the Islamic revolution of Iran, the Guadeloupe Conference was held by four Western powers: the United States, the United Kingdom, France and West Germany. The meeting was held between 4 and 7 January 1979. The president of France, Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing, hosted the meeting; also in attendance were the president of United States, Jimmy Carter, the chancellor of West Germany, Helmut Schmidt, and the prime Minister of the United Kingdom, James Callaghan.  Discussion  The meeting's discussions focused on: Iran's political crisis, the situation in Cambodia, violence in South Africa, the increasing influence of the Soviet Union in the Persian Gulf, the coup in Afghanistan, and the situation in Turkey. One of the main issues discussed was the political crisis in Iran which had led to an uprising against the Pahlavi dynasty. The assembled leaders concluded that there was no way to save Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's position as the Shah of Iran, and that if he remained as leader this could further aggravate the civil war and might result in Soviet intervention.  Impact  The leaders at the Guadeloupe Conference suggested that Shah leave Iran as early as possible. After the meeting, domestic protests and opposition to the Pahlavi dynasty increased. After the conference ended, the Shah's regime collapsed and he left Iran for exile on 16 January 1979, the last monarch of the Pahlavi dynasty. =Downfall of Callaghan government= The summit also led, indirectly, to Callaghan's election loss to Margaret Thatcher almost four months later. His participation in the summit had been preceded by a few days' holiday during which he was photographed swimming joyfully and wearing swimming trunks on the beach. During that same week Britain had been struggling with the economic impact of a severe winter storm and a lorry drivers' strike, the second of many industrial disputes which led to that season being remembered as the Winter of Discontent. Upon Callaghan's return on 10 January, a political advisor, Tom McNally, convinced him to hold a brief news conference with waiting reporters after he deplaned at Heathrow Airport, against the advice of the prime minister's press secretary. McNally believed that Callaghan could reassure the public that he was in control by doing so. The impromptu news conference instead hurt Callaghan politically. Callaghan at first focused on his own trip, jauntily how pleasant it had been to swim in the tropical waters off Guadeloupe. He suggested that Britain's domestic situation only looked as bad as it did because the media had exaggerated it, and cast aspersions on reporters' patriotism. Asked directly what he would do about \\"mounting chaos\\" in the UK, he responded: \\"[I]f you look at it from outside, and perhaps you're taking rather a parochial view at the moment, I don't think that other people in the world would share the view that there is mounting chaos.\\" The Sun, a newspaper which had recently switched its political allegiance from Callaghan's Labour to the opposition Conservatives, paraphrased this in a headline as \\"Crisis? What Crisis?\\". The Conservatives made much use of the phrase during the upcoming election, and in subsequent campaigns.

Early life and education  Robert Murphy was born in 1806 in Mallow, County Cork, Ireland and was baptized in the Church of Ireland on 8 March 1807, the third son (of seven children) of John Murphy, a shoemaker, and Margaret Murphy. When he was 11, Murphy was run over by a cart in an accident that resulted in a fractured thighbone. This incident left him bedridden for one year. During this time, Murphy read the works of Euclid and studied algebra. Anonymous solutions to mathematical problems posed in a local newspaper brought Murphy attention from a mathematical tutor in Cork, named Mulcahy. Money was found for him to attend Mr Hopley's school in Mallow. Murphy then had sponsorship to take him to Trinity College, Dublin, in 1823; but was not admitted. With support from Robert Woodhouse, he was brought to Cambridge on the strength of a pamphlet on the duplication of the cube. He was admitted as a pensioner to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, on 7 July 1825. Murphy won the 1st Mathematics Prize in 1826 and went on to graduate with a first class degree, B.A. in 1829, as 3rd wrangler. It led to Murphy being awarded a Perse Fellowship. At the same time, to help his financial position, he was appointed as Librarian.  Later life  Murphy gave six Hebrew lectures in 1830 (receiving ¬£10 as payment), and was appointed as a junior dean in charge of discipline and chapel services in October 1831, a position he held until 1833. He was ordained a deacon on 4 June 1831 and gave Greek lectures in 1832. But he never obtained a senior fellowship at Caius. While living in London in difficult circumstances, Murphy wrote a paper on what are now called non-commutative rings. He was elected to a Stokes Fellowship by Caius College, Cambridge in 1838. He was appointed as an examiner of mathematics and natural philosophy at the University of London in October 1838.  Death  Murphy's years of alcohol abuse took a toll on his health. In 1843, he contracted tuberculosis of the lungs. He died soon after, on March 12, 1843. Murphy was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery, London, where \\"[t]he grave has no headstone nor landing stone nor surround. It is totally unmarked\\".  Publications  In 1830 Murphy was commissioned to write a book on the mathematical theory of electricity, for the use of students at Cambridge. Elementary Principles of Electricity, Heat, and Molecular Actions, part i. On Electricity (Cambridge) was published in 1833. His other book was Theory of Algebraical Equations, in \\"Library of Useful Knowledge\\", London, 1839, reprinted 1847. =Papers and articles= Refutation of a Pamphlet Written by the Rev. John Mackey Entitled \\"A Method of Making a Cube a Double of a Cube, Founded on the Principles of Elementary Geometry\\", wherein His Principles Are Proved Erroneous and the Required Solution Not Yet Obtained (1824) was the work that launched Murphy's career. Another notable paper was It included the first citation of the work of George Green. Murphy recognized its value, in particular Green's \\"1828 essay\\". Murphy contributed other mathematical papers to the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions (1831‚Äì1836), Philosophical Magazine (1833‚Äì1842), and the Philosophical Transactions (1837). Encouraged by Augustus De Morgan, Murphy wrote articles for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge and for the Penny Cyclopaedia. His final works were Remark on Primitive Radices (1841), Calculations of Logarithms by Means of Algebraic Fractions (1841), and On Atmospheric Refraction (1842). De Morgan claimed \\"He had a true genius for mathematical invention\\".

They escape after Alfred (Sean Pertwee) fights with the assassins. Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) reunites with Falcone (John Doman), who wants to know how Maroni knew his money was stored at the armory, thinking Cobblepot double-crossed him. Cobblepot tries to tell him there's a mole in his crew. Harvey Dent (Nicholas D'Agosto) begins to suspect Lovecraft (Al Sapienza) is responsible for the assassins. During a mob dinner with Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) and other mobsters, Falcone kills Irish mob boss Bannion for not guarding the money and states their tribute rates will increase 25% to recover from the money lost in the armory. Bruce and Selina arrive at an underground base with some kids. They decide to go a place called the Narrows, where a fence, Clyde (Devin Harjes) will pay them. Bullock (Donal Logue) receives the information from Mooney about the Narrows. Gordon finds Lovecraft in his apartment, denying any involvement and claiming the assassins are after him too. The assassins arrive and knock out Gordon. When he wakes up, he finds Lovecraft dead in his bathtub with a bullet to the head, fired with Gordon's gun. Bruce and Selina arrive with Clyde, where Selina offers some things she stole from Wayne Manor. Clyde offers less than expected and locks them in a warehouse. The assassins arrive, looking for Selina but they escape through some tools in the warehouse. The GCPD arrives and a shootout ensues. Bruce manages to distract Copperhead so Selina can escape. Later Selina visits Bruce and kisses him. In the GCPD, Mayor James (Richard Kind) chastises Gordon and Dent.

The episode received a rating of 75% with an average score of 5.0 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"While 'Lovecraft' struggles with the balance of campy thrills and deliberate plotting, Alfred and Wayne's characters elevate Gotham to Batman-worthy heights.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.4 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"With \\"Lovecraft,\\" Gotham chose to take us out of the midseason with a focus on the Bruce/Alfred relationship, letting the Gordon/Bullock partnership that seemed to take a turn in 'Penguin's Umbrella' and 'The Mask' fizzle out. There was a lot of action, and it was cool to watch Alfred get super violent, but it still remains very difficult to make anything on this series feel like something other than filler for a future Batman story.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"C+\\" grade and wrote, \\"22 episodes is a lot of television. It's a lot of television to create, especially when you originally planned a story that spanned 16 episodes. Gotham executive producer Danny Cannon acknowledged as much in an interview posted online today. He talks about needing to stretch the story out, to spend more time with characters and emotions rather than rushing to a massive climax. In theory, that all sounds great‚Äìthis is a show that could use a little deliberation from time to time‚Äìbut if 'Lovecraft,' the midseason finale, is any indication of what a stretched out story looks like on Gotham, then we‚Äôre in for a tedious back-half of the show‚Äôs first season.\\" References External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:2014 American television episodes ","title":"Lovecraft (Gotham)"},{"id":"49206783","title":"Swimming at the 1969 South Pacific Games"},{"id":"49206810","text":"Zubin Minoo Bharucha (born 8 January 1970) is an Indian former first-class cricketer who played for Bombay and Surrey County Cricket Club.

During its final decade he emerged as an opponent of the East German one-party dictatorship, becoming a member of the League of Evangelical Churches in the German Democratic Republic (Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR/BEK). Since the collapse of the East German political regime in 1989/90 he has participated prominently on committees and as an author seeking to understand and evaluate it. Life Neubert was born into the family of a Protestant minister in 1940 in Herschdorf, a hillside village near Erfurt in central southern Germany. He grew up in nearby Gro√üenbehringen. Between 1958 and 1963 he studied Theology at Jena. After 1964 he worked at Niedersynderstedt initially as a vicar and later as the minister in charge for the parish. From 1973 he was combining his parish duties with work as a student chaplain at nearby Weimar. In 1976, probably on the advice of Robert Havemann, he joined the CDU, in western Germany a political party of the moderate right, but in the politically and by this time physically separated eastern German state, one of the so-called \\"block parties\\" controlled by the ruling Socialist Unity Party of Germany (Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands/SED) party through an organisation known as the National Front (Nationale Front der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik/NF). In 1984 Neubert resigned from the CDU. In 1984 he became community sociology secretary in the Theology Studies department with the Berlin-based East German League of Evangelical Churches. From 1967 Ehrhart Neubert was also taking part in various informal discussion groups, focusing on theology, sociology and the interface between them. He was sympathetic to the civil right demands of Robert Havemann, who was seen by the regime as a high-profile political dissident. By 1979 Neubert was participating actively in Peace Groups of the Evangelical Students' Association and, during then 1980s, in other peace circles. He found himself increasingly in conflict both with the state authorities and with the inherently collaborationist leaderships of the official evangelical churches which were keen to retain a level of recognition and toleration from the party leadership. Neubert also produced a number of quasi-political sociological and theological studies: some of his work appeared in West Germany under the pseudonym \\"Christian Joachim\\". During East Germany's Peaceful Revolution, Neubert was a co-founder of the Democratic Awakening movement, founded in 1989 in his apartment. He contributed to the new party's programme and served as its first vice-chairman. He represented Democratic Awakening at several of the East German Round Table sessions and served on various related investigatory commissions. A (relatively) young fellow activist in Democratic Awakening was Angela Merkel who later became Chancellor of Germany. Finding himself out of sympathy with what he saw at the time a shift towards the political right, in January 1990 Neubert resigned from Democratic Awakening. The crunch issue appears to have been the issue of its developing political alliances, notably with the CDU (party): Merkel stayed. After reunification, which formally took place in the late summer of 1990, in 1992 he became a member of the Brandenburg branch of the Alliance 90 (political party). In 1976 the Ministry for State Security (Stasi) had attempted, without success, to recruit Neubert: sixteen years later, as a member of the \\"Law and reconciliation\\" initiative Neubert stood up for the rights of Stasi victims and for fair and consistent treatment of those involved in the endlessly complex interactions of the Stasi and the Protestant churches in former East Germany. In 1992 the Alliance 90 group in the Brandenburg Landtag (\\"regional parliament\\") nominated him as a member of the Stolpe inquiry committee. The committee concluded its work in 1994 (although many of the matters it investigated would not be so quickly laid to rest). In 1996 Ehrhart Neubart re-joined the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (Christlich Demokratische Union Deutschlands/CDU party). That same year, at the age of 46, he received his doctorate from the Free University of Berlin for a dissertation on the history of political opposition in the German Democratic Republic from 1949 to 1989. In 1998 the work was published, repackaged into a volume of approximately 1000 pages. In 1997 Neubert took a post with the Stasi Records Agency (Bundesbeauftragten f√ºr die Unterlagen des Staatssicherheitsdienstes der ehemaligen Deutschen Demokratischen Republik/BStU), taking charge of the agency's research and education department. Together with the agency's commissioner of the time, Joachim Gauck, Neubert compiled the German contribution to the German-language version of The Black Book of Communism, writing the chapter entitled \\"Politische Verbrechen in der DDR\\" (\\"Political Crimes in East Germany\\"). Elsewhere he has made numerous further written contributions on resistance and opposition, and the position of religious people and institutions, in former East Germany. In 1998 he was co-opted as a board member of the Federal Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship (Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED- Diktatur). By this time he had already become, in 1996, a founding member of the B√ºrgerb√ºro (Verein) B√ºrgerb√ºro - Verein zur Aufarbeitung von Folgesch√§den der SED-Diktatur, a Berlin-based organisation established to provide practical and psychological advice and support for victims of East Germany's Socialist Unity Party version of socialism, subsequently becoming the organisation's president on the death of B√§rbel Bohley. Erhart Neubert retired in 2005, but still fills in as a Lutheran minister in the Limlingerode area. He married Hildigund (born Hildigund Falcke) in 1987: she shares his background as an East German opposition activist with evangelical church connections, also sharing his commitment since 1990 to researching and recording the dictatorship. More recently she served for ten years as State Commissioner for Stasi records in Thuringia.

The reserve covers two types of habitat: the flat Arkharinskaya lowlands with abundant wetlands, and forested spurs of the Lesser Hinggan mountains. In particular, Khingan Reserve was created to protect steppe and forest-steppe landscapes, and nesting sites of the endangered Red-crowned crane (Ussuri crane) and the vulnerable White- naped crane. The reserve is situated in the Arkharinsky District of Amur Oblast. Topography The Khingan Nature reserve is divided into two separate sections, one on the Amur-Zeya-Bureya intermountain plains (about 70% of the area), and one in the low rugged hills of the left bank of the Amur River (70% of the area). The lowlands are Quaternary lakes and rivers of alluvial and sedimentary rocks. The mountain section averages 200‚Äì400 meters in height, with the highest point (Mount Erakticha) being 504 meters in altitude. Climate and Ecoregion Khingan is located in the Amur meadow steppe ecoregion. This is a low-lying fertile floodplain, with patches of deciduous subtaiga forests. Situated in the middle Amur River in the Russian Far East, and northeast China, trees are generally found only in the upland areas, due to the frequent flooding of the plains. Species endemism is low, in part because the area was not glaciated in the latest Ice Age. The climate of Khingan is Humid Continental Climate (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dwb)). High variation in temperature, both daily and seasonally; with dry winters and cool summers. January has an average temperature -27 C. July averages +21 C. Flora and fauna The vegetation and animals of the Khingan Reserve is marked by the interpenetration of different floristic groups, with a wide variety of growing conditions and microclimate, in the intersection of plains grassland, wetlands (including sphagnum bogs), and larch and cedar-broad-leaf forest habitats. The plains section of the reserve exhibit Far Eastern forest- steppe type terrain, typically sedge, reed grass, and mixed grass meadows interspersed with islands of birch forest. The mountainous section exhibits Far East broad-leaf forest terrain. Red-crowned cranes flying White-naped crane Animals in the reserve are a mixture of the typical residents of both East Siberian forests and the Manchurian region: large ungulates (roe deer, wapiti, wild boar) and forest dwellers (chipmunk, squirrel, wolf, fox, brown bear, sable, elk). Over 290 species of birds have been recorded, both waterfowl for the wetland habitats and predators of the forests. The most common fish in the lakes are carp, minnow and loach, in the rivers the most common fish are grayling. Ecotourism As a strict nature reserve, the reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are 'ecotourist' routes, such as to 'White Bird Lake', however, that are open to the public, but arrangements must be made at the main office. Reserve staff give guided tours to the lakes to see the flowering of the Kormorov Lotus from mid-July to mid-August. Tour groups are welcome by arrangement and over a thousand visitors are received each year. There are rustic accommodations available in some of the buffer areas. The reserve currently runs a volunteer program for groups willing to help with conservation activities in the field. The main office, which also has a small nature museum and wildlife nursery open to the public, is in the town of Arkhara.

His family name is Anosov, his name was Pavel and his father's name was Peter, hence the patronymic name Petrovich.  Early life  Anosov was the son of a petty clerk, and became an orphan at 13 years old. When his father died he left four young children as orphans: two older brothers, Peter and Pavel, and two younger sisters. The orphans took over the education of their maternal grandfather, mining official Sabakin Lev Fedorovich who was a mechanic in the Kama plants in Izhevsk and Votkinsk. The grandfather sent Pavel with his elder brother Peter to the St. Petersburg Mining Cadet Corps in 1810, during which time his brother Peter died. Pavel Anosov's skill at mathematics and science led him to early success. In 1817 he completed his Mining corps (Mountain corps) training, and joined the state factories at Zlatoust as a trainee. He took care of his younger sisters, the youngest of whom was soon married. The other remained a spinster at the time of Paul Anosov's death, and remained gravely unwell at their home.  Career  Statue in honor P.P. Anosov was erected in Zlatoust, Urals Military District, by Moscow sculptors A.P. Antropov and N.L. Strain and architect T.L. Shulgina on the 15 of December, 1954. –ó–ª–∞—Ç–æ—É—Å—Ç >> –ü–∞–º—è—Ç–Ω–∏–∫ –ü. –ü. –ê–Ω–æ—Å–æ–≤—É.

His civil ranks in the Russian Empire had military rank equivalents, and Anosov was promoted from a trainee (equivalent to lieutenant in military rank) to Governor (equivalent to General) in twenty years. Anosov received international attention for his writings on the manufacture of iron and his re-discovery of the secret of Damascene steel, previously thought lost in the Middle Ages. He explained the effect of the chemical composition, structure and treatment of steel on its properties. His findings formed the basis for the science of quality steels. Anosov summed up his studies in his now classic treatise, Damascene steels (1841), which was immediately translated into German and French. Anosov was the first to use the microscope in studies into the structure of steel (1831), laying the foundation for the microscopic analysis of metals. Anosov was elected a corresponding member of Kazan University in 1844, and an honorary member of Kharkov University in 1846.

She has received two Academy Awards, a BAFTA and an Emmy for her designs. Career Phyllis Margaret Dalton was born in October 1925 in London, England. As a teenager she studied at the Ealing School of Art. After the outbreak of World War II she began training as a Wren at the code-breaking facility Bletchley Park which she said she found to be \\"unbelievably boring\\".Brownlow, Kevin; David Lean: A Biography; St. Martins Press; 1st edition (September 1997) In 1946, after being \\"demobbed\\" her grandmother entered her into a competition at Vogue Magazine where she won the opportunity to work as an assistant in the wardrobe department at Gainsborough Studios in Islington. Once there, she began cutting her teeth on films like Brian Desmond Hurst's A Christmas Carol; Alfred Hitchcock's The Man Who Knew Too Much and on Anatole Litvak's Anastasia. By 1957 Dalton branched out on her own as a designer, making a name for herself on films like Island in the Sun directed by Robert Rossen (1957), with James Mason and Joan Fontaine; and Our Man in Havana (1959) directed by Carol Reed, starring Sir Alec Guinness and No√´l Coward. But perhaps her most memorable work may well be from her collaboration with Sir David Lean on two of his most critically acclaimed films: Lawrence of Arabia in 1962, starring Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif; and again three years later on Dr. Zhivago starring Sharif and Julie Christie, for which she won her first Academy Award. For this particular film, Dalton and her team ended up making 3,000 individual costumes and putting together 35,000 individual items of clothing for the extras. The characters of Zhivago (Sharif) and Lara (Christie) each had approximately 90 costume combinations, and the other six other principal characters had an average of fifteen costume changes each. Because this was before CGI, by the time principal photography ended it was estimated the costume dept. had used up a total of 984 yards of fabric, 300,000 yards of thread, 1 million buttons and 7,000 safety pins. Peter O'Toole in one of Dalton's more famous costumes for Lawrence: the sheikh's white robes and keffiyeh given to him by Sherif Ali.

Other notable ones include Lord Jim (1965) again with O'Toole and directed by Richard Brooks, Oliver!

The brand started from Reach toothbrushes developed by DuPont in 1976.  History = 1970s = 1976 ‚Äì DuPont enters toothbrush market after four years of research conducted by \\"bio-dental team\\" from Tufts University, headed by Percy H. Hill Jr., consultant to Applied Ergonomics company. Reach Toothbrush was the first ergonomically designed toothbrush, that proved significantly better in clinical trials (Google Books) and spawned a whole new field of \\"toothbrush design\\". 1976 article at Chicago Tribune highlights the following unique selling propositions of the new toothbrush: \\"an angled-shaped four-sided handle (for comfortable gripping) with an extended neck (that makes hard-to-reach areas more accessible), and a compact head topped with bilevel bristles\\". DuPont started new toothbrush promotion in April 1976 first in Green Bay, Wisconsin, then moved to Chicago, with advertising in newspapers and on TV. 1977 ‚Äì Johnson & Johnson acquires Reach brand from DuPont, outmaneuvering Procter & Gamble. 1978 ‚Äì Johnson & Johnson introduced the brand nationally, backing the launch with \\"the first million- dollar ad campaign ever produced for a toothbrush\\". = 1980s = 1982 ‚Äì Reach introduces Reach Child Brush. 1983 ‚Äì Reach toothbrush was featured in Tooth Protectors videogame for the Atari 2600 video game console along with Johnson & Johnson dental floss and Act mouthwash. 1985 ‚Äì Reach toothbrush gained recognition from American Dental Association. 1986 ‚Äì Mr. Reach character with the famous flip-top head, was born in Australia. Developed by animator Phil Meatchem this mascot found its way to many world markets, including Japan and the U.S. 1987 ‚Äì Johnson & Johnson advertised Reach toothbrush with the marketing claim that it \\"cleans 51% better than the other leading brush. It's angled to reach even back teeth\\". At the end of 80's Reach occupied 28% of the US market, successfully competing against market leader Oral-B (35% of the market). However, by 1991 its market share dropped to 20%. = 1990s = 1993 ‚Äì Reach introduced first ever child toothbrush named \\"Wondergrip\\", designed by \\"Smart Design\\" (NY) studio. Previously, all children‚Äôs toothbrushes were just scaled down adult brushes. To make this toothbrush \\"Smart Design\\" studied the brushing behavior of more than 100 kids, coming up with the shape that encourages proper brushing technique. 1996 ‚Äì Reach introduced Reach Plaque Sweeper toothbrush and Reach Floss Gentle Gum Care. J&J; doubled its advertising budgets vs. previous year to more than $20 million ‚Äì in a move aimed to recover market share that declined to 15.5%. = 2000s = 2001 ‚Äì Reach partnered with Warner Bros. and created Harry Potter Toothbrush for the start of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone movie. 2006 ‚Äì Fuel Industries developed a globe-trotting animated advergame \\"Mr. Reach: In the Mouth of Mystery\\" for Johnson & Johnson Canada, featuring various Reach dental products and Mr. Reach character. 2008 ‚Äì In August 2008 Reach introduced Reach UltraClean toothbrush and floss. 2009 ‚Äì Johnson & Johnson directly attacked its main competitors stating that Reach UltraClean floss removes up to two times more plaque than Glide (Procter & Gamble) floss and that UltraClean Toothbrush removes more plaque and provides improved gum health versus the Colgate 360¬∞ toothbrush. Based on clinical trials the company also stated that Reach UltraClean Toothbrush removes up to 90% of plaque in places that are hard to reach. 2010 ‚Äì Total Care Floss Clean toothbrush designed by Fuseproject won IDEA 2010 award. Same year Reach introduced new line \\"Reach Total Care Plus Whitening\\" with toothbrush and floss, designed to whiten teeth. Also in 2010 Reach started \\"Reach by design\\" collaboration with interior designers Celerie Kemble and Tom Delavan as well as celebrity fashion stylist Brad Goreski. 2011 ‚Äì Reach Total Care Plus Whitening advertising came under criticism from the National Advertising Division, that suggested J&J; to change claims \\"Ordinary toothbrushes clean teeth. Reach whitens them\\" and \\"At the core of this revolutionary toothbrush Reach has engineered a unique row of bristles infused with calcium carbonate microwhitening technology. That means each time you brush, you're whitening teeth and removing stains\\". As an outcome NAD determined that J&J; could support the claim that \\"[o]rdinary toothbrushes clean teeth. Reach whitens them\\", but suggested to modify other claims to ensure that consumers are aware that stain removal is accomplished extrinsically, through the stain-removing abrasive action of the bristles, not intrinsically through bleaching. Also in 2011 Reach continued collaboration with design celebrities, inviting Flipping Out star Jeff Lewis and Shoshanna Gruss to join \\"Reach by Design\\" project. 2012 ‚Äì In December 2012 \\"Johnson & Johnson\\" sold rights to market Reach toothbrushes in the U.S., its territories, the Caribbean and Canada to \\"Dr. Fresh LLC\\", a portfolio company of Moelis Capital Partners, for an undisclosed sum. The acquisition did not include Reach floss or other interdental products. 2014 ‚Äì In April 2014 Dr. Fresh introduced \\"Complete Care Triple Angle\\" toothbrushes, presenting them on its website as \\"the most advanced Reach brushes ever made\\". 2015 ‚Äì Dr. Fresh re-introduced Mr. Reach in its advertising for \\"Reach Complete Care 8-in-1 Rinse\\". At the same year Johnson & Johnson discontinued Reach brand name and rebranded Reach floss into Listerine floss, notifying consumers about this on official website in June 2015. 2016 - LG Household & Health Care announced on November 1, 2016 that it agreed to acquire the Asia Pacific business of Reach brand from Johnson & Johnson.

Three main festivals are celebrated in Bhayankavu. The first one is on Thulam 1st (the middle of the month of October). The second one is known as 'Makarachovva' (first Tuesday of Malayalam month 'Makaram'.) The annual Thalappoli ritual in the temple is observed according to the Malayalam calendar Sree Bhadra Varavu Committee. During the 'Thalappoli' festival the ritual 'Pavakkooth' (a shadow play like as doll-play, but where only the shadows of different characters of Hindu deities can be seen) is conducted in the temple throughout the month of 'Kumbam' (normally 16 February to 15 March). During these days, \\"Kalamezhuthu\\" is conducted in the Temple.The next Thalappoli is on 14 March 2021 The coloured powders used for the kalam are prepared from natural products only. The pigments are extracted from plants - rice flour (white), charcoal powder (black), turmeric powder (yellow), powdered green leaves (green), and a mixture of turmeric powder and lime (red). It often takes more than two hours to finish a kalam drawing with appealing perfection. Decorations like a canopy of palm fronds, garlands of red hibiscus flowers and thulasi or Ocimum leaves are hung above the kalam. Also during the festival, women carry lighted lamps and move in a procession to the temple for peace and prosperity. Normally, hundreds of devotees participate to witness this important ritual in the temple.

It premiered on FOX on January 5, 2015 and was written by Sue Chung, and directed by Oz Scott. In this episode, Gordon (Ben McKenzie) is transferred to Arkham Asylum and tries to avoid a conflict when inmates riot with the help of Dr. Leslie Thompkins (Morena Baccarin). The episode was watched by 7.06 million viewers, an improvement over the previous episode. It received mixed reviews, with critics criticizing the time spent in Arkham Asylum. On January 17, 12 days after the episode aired, FOX announced Gotham would be renewed for a second season. Plot Gordon (Ben McKenzie) has been transferred to Arkham Asylum after Dick Lovecraft's \\"suicide\\". During a play, inmates wreak havoc, sending some to the infirmary. Director Dr. Gerry Lang (Isiah Whitlock, Jr.) begins to doubt about his progression in the Asylum. He stands guard on an inmate at the infirmary as Dr. Leslie Thompkins (Morena Baccarin) treats him. In the streets, Selina (Camren Bicondova) discovers Ivy (Clare Foley) living behind a dumpster in the rain. She takes Ivy to Barbara's penthouse to sleep. Mysterious attacks continue to take place in Arkham, upsetting Lang, as all the attacks happened during Gordon's guard. After help from Bullock (Donal Logue), they discover that the prisoner, Jack Gruber (Christopher Heyerdahl) is behind the attacks, planning on escaping the Asylum. A nurse, Dorothy Duncan (Allyce Beasley) turns out to be an inmate and frees the prisoners. The inmates wreak havoc in the Asylum, killing guards and Dr. Lang. Among the escapees is Gruber, who flees with Aaron Danzig (Kevin McCormick). At their apartment, Montoya (Victoria Cartagena) decides to break up with Barbara (Erin Richards), thinking she's deteriorating her health. Cobblepot is arrested when he tries to charge more to Maroni's (David Zayas) fishermen of what they get. He is released and chastised by Maroni for his actions, who reveals he ordered his arrest to teach him a lesson about hubris. Mooney (Jada Pinkett Smith) reunites with an underboss, Jimmy Saviano (John Ennos III) to take out Falcone (John Doman). Her right-hand, Butch (Drew Powell), meets with him at the port. Saviano offers Butch a place with him if he betrays Mooney. He refuses and kills Saviano. Reception=Viewers= The episode was watched by 7.06 million viewers, with a 2.5 rating among 18-49 adults. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 10.10 million viewers, and a 3.8 in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Critical reviews= \\"Rogues' Gallery\\" received mixed reviews. The episode received a rating of 43% with an average score of 6.2 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: \\"While we've been waiting to spend time in Gothams Arkham Asylum, 'Rogue's Gallery' was cluttered, confused, and borderline boring.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a \\"good\\" 7.2 out of 10 and wrote in his verdict, \\"I could have actually stood for more Arkham this week rather than paying obligatory visits to so many of the other Gothamites. I wanted more Leslie and more intrigue within the asylum walls. Plus, things are also now starting to point toward the Wayne Foundation, or some other big bad, in the shadows.\\" The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a \\"C-\\" grade and wrote, \\"'Rogues' Gallery,' much like Gotham as a whole, suffers from a baffling identity crisis, as evidenced in the episode's opening moments. In the span of just a few minutes, we're re-introduced to all the relevant storylines via a montage. We see Jim Gordon on guard at Arkham Asylum as the inmates put on an incompetent production of Shakespeare. We see Harvey Bullock quietly pondering his life, or perhaps his next fedora purchase, while drinking from a flask. We see Selina Kyle peering out into the rain, also pondering, and Barbara sleeping next to Montoya, bottles of pills strewn about the nightstand. Establishing where these characters are isn't a misguided move, but the execution is off and indicative of what plagues this show as a whole. One minute we're meant to be laughing at the crazy Asylum patients and their strange rendition of Shakespeare, and the next we're meant to be contemplating the seriousness of the situation Gordon has got himself into, and how widespread corruption has corroded the city of Gotham and allowed good guys like Gordon to be buried. There's a frustrating imbalance here, all in the first few minutes. It's jarring to go from a comical stage play to an investigation into amateur shock therapy, followed shortly by an exploration of deeply-felt insecurity in romantic relationships. Gotham wants to be too many things at once, and it‚Äôs to the detriment of narrative precision and intrigue.\\" References External links  * * Category:Gotham (season 1) episodes Category:2015 American television episodes ","title":"Rogues' Gallery (Gotham)"},{"id":"49207274","text":"Karin Giegerich (born 15 May 1963) is a German actress.

Cuomo states \\"Suddenly the song is sunny and sweet and in my mind, creatively this is when the high kicks in ‚Äî everything is lovely and dreamy.\\" Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone compared the song's opening feedback to that of \\"No Other One\\" from Pinkerton.

A convention center, the International Eucharistic Congress Pavilion, was constructed for this occasion. Pope Francis sent Cardinal Charles Maung Bo of Myanmar as his papal legate and presider at the opening Mass on January 24. This was the second time that the Philippines hosted the International Eucharistic Congress, with the first one held in Manila on February 3‚Äì7, 1937. Preparations The Cebu City Traffic Office ran traffic dry-runs days before the event to ensure that the traffic situation during the event would be manageable. Several roads were closed and others open to public vehicles only. Catholic Schools and selected public schools in Cebu, including universities, suspended classes during the IEC week. The Philippine National Police's Regional Office 7 ensured safety and security for the event and its ad-hoc task group on the IEC and Sinulog requested additional support from Camp Crame, including the Explosives Ordnance Division and bomb-sniffing dog squad of the Philippine military. Marketing=Mobile app= The IEC2016 Guide was developed by InnoPub Media as the official mobile app for the event which included information for the event such as schedules, speakers, basic theological text, news and updates, and linked to the official livestream feed of the event. It also included information on tourism sites within Metro Cebu, particularly religious heritage sites such as churches. =Logo= The logo used for the 2016 International Eucharistic Congress was derived from a logo design competition. The winning design was made by Jayson Jaluag, a 19-year-old fine arts student from Mandaue. The Sun signifies the hope of glory and a new beginning. It also emphasizes the host country whose flag has the sun as one of its primary elements. The seven rays of the sun represent the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. The chalice and bread signify the sacredness of the Eucharist. The \\"IHS\\" monogram which stands for (Iesus Hominum Salvator) symbolize the Holy Name of Jesus and represents the host city of Cebu whose former name was Villa del Santissimo Nombre de Jesus. The missionary nature of the Catholic Church is symbolized by the stylized boat. The three people on the boat in different colors portrays the principles which influence the faith of Filipinos: green for hope, blue for faith itself, and red for charity. The boat's aqua blue color represents the Christian pilgrimage to Heaven. =Theme= The theme for event revolved around hope and was derived from a Biblical verse: \\"Christ in you, our hope and glory\\" (Col. 1:27). Venues The International Eucharistic Congress (IEC) Pavilion (renamed as IC3 Convention Center after the event), built by Duros Development Corporation, served the primary venue of the Congress. Events=Theological Symposium= The Cebu Doctors' University in Mandaue was the venue of the Theological Symposium From January 20‚Äì22, a symposium was held at the Cebu Doctors' University in Mandaue, Cebu where the Eucharist among other topics were discussed. Members of the clergy and theologians attended the symposium. 1,800 people attended on the first day. Among the speakers and workshop facilitators that led the event were: *Fr. Timothy Radcliffe (United Kingdom) discussed the virtue of hope. He spoke of a \\"crisis of hope\\" caused by the rise of terrorism. He described hope as \\"not just intellectual curiosity\\" but also as \\"existential\\". * Fr. Francis Moloney (Australia), a Salesian priest, author and editor, discussed the passage from the Gospel of John, ‚ÄúHe loved them to the end‚Äù, and gave a narrative on the Eucharist's institution. * Fr. Mark Francis (United States), President of Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, discussed the topic of liturgy and inculturation. * Monsignor Piero Marini (Italy), president of the Pontifical Committee for the IEC and a papal master of ceremonies for 20 years, spoke in Italian on La storia del nuovo \\"Ordo Missae\\" (The history of the new Order of Mass).Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses Activities (Retrieved August 2019) * Fr.

The Police Regional Office 7 estimates that the Mass was attended by at least 350,000 people. ;January 26 Cardinal Bo along with other church officials visited the Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center. Bo was joined by Cebu Archbishop Jos√© S. Palma and the papal legate's protocol officer Fr. Jan Limchua. They witnessed the CPDRC Dancing Inmates performing the theme of the Congress and interacted with the inmates after the performance. ;January 28 Don Bosco Youth Center (DBYC) in Barangay Pasil, Cebu City, was visited by Cardinal Bo, himself a Salesians of Don Bosco. The DBYC performed a traditional Sinulog dance for the visiting cardinal. Bo had visited a slum area prior to his visit to the youth center. At his speech before students of the youth center, he urged the youth to pursue their vocations, never give up, and never blame others, themselves, or their situations as an excuse to remain idle. ;January 29 In the morning at the IEC Pavilion, Cardinals John Onaiyekan of Nigeria and Oswald Gracias of India spoke on the Eucharist. At the meet attended by 15,000 people, Onaiyekan criticized discrimination in the Church which he called a form of \\"apartheid\\" and he urged that the IEC should be open to people regardless of social standing. He also criticized the government of Saudi Arabia and ISIS for the practice of crucifixion, the former for using it for capital punishment and the latter for using it against Christians in disrespect for the sacredness of the symbol of the cross. He noted the violent response to the alleged disrespect of the Quran, while urging people to respect the religious symbols of people of other faiths. He also criticized the satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo. Onaiyekan said that despite all this, \\"the cross still remains the symbol of the victory of the Lord Jesus,‚Äù The second Mass of the IEC was held at 4:00 pm local time. A grand procession was held after the Mass with a custom-made, gold-plated brass monstrance on a float accompanying devotees.There were about 1.5million of people who joined the said procession ;January 30 As one of the highlights of the Congress, Cebu Archbishop Emeritus Ricardo Vidal administered first communion to 5,000 children, some of them street children. ;January 31 The Congress concluded with the Statio Orbis or closing Mass. It was expected that millions were to attend the event. Pope Francis announced the next International Eucharistic Congress would be held in 2020 in Budapest, Hungary. Media coverage The 2016 edition marked the first time that the congress had a global satellite broadcast. The Philippine Broadcast Pool under the auspices of Radio-Television Malaca√±ang (RTVM) was activated to facilitate the media coverage of the event. It was planned that the coverage of the event would be similar to that of Pope Francis's visit to the Philippines in January 2015. The IEC Channel featured 12 hours of programming which covered all major events of the IEC, live and tape-delay broadcasts. RTVM was responsible for running the control room including the master switcher as well as the events held at the IEC Pavilion and International Media Center. The People‚Äôs Television Network was responsible for the outdoor coverage. With assistance from the Supreme Office of the Knights of Columbus, the main satellite uplink was provided by Apstar Global which enabled the broadcasting of the IEC to as far as Italy and the United States. PLDT provided a bandwidth of 1 GB to the TOC. Cignal TV broadcast the IEC in two of its channels; standard definition on Channel 99 and high definition for Channel 199. TV Maria and the Cebu Catholic Television Network also broadcast the IEC. The EWTN Global Catholic Network which had a reach of 144 countries, RAI of Italy, and Centro Televisivo Vaticano covered the event, as well as Radyo Veritas in Luzon and DYRF for Visayas and Mindanao, besides the stations of the Catholic Media Network.

The surviving records on the internal history and rulers of the Emirate of Crete are very fragmentary. Following the studies of George C. Miles with the aid of numismatic evidence, he is tentatively identified as a son of the eighth emir, Shu'ayb II, who ruled ca. 940‚Äì943, himself the great-great-grandson of the conqueror of Crete and founder of the Emirate of Crete, Abu Hafs Umar. The beginning of his reign is placed in 949, in succession to his uncle Ali. By the Byzantine chroniclers he is chiefly called \\"Kouroupas\\", apparently from an Arabic surname al- Qurtubi, \\"from Cordoba\\", whence the family had originally come. The 14th- century Egyptian historian al-Nuwayri reports that the Byzantine emperor Romanos II dispatched three embassies to the island seeking to conclude a peace treaty in exchange for the payment of an annual sum to Abd al-Aziz, with the purpose of concealing the ongoing preparations for a campaign to recover the island. This report is mostly considered legendary by modern scholars. At the head of a huge fleet and army, Nikephoros Phokas sailed in June or July 960, landed on the island, and defeated the initial Muslim resistance. A long siege of the emirate's capital of Chandax followed, which dragged over the winter into 961. The city was finally stormed on 6 March 961. At this time, Abd al-Aziz is described by Theodosios the Deacon as small, pale, bald, and very ill, but an eloquent and flattering speaker. In vain, the emir sent for aid to the Fatimids in Ifriqiya and the Emirate of Cordoba in Spain; the Muslim rulers sent envoys to him, but, impressed by the Byzantine might, they refrained from intervening. After the capture of Chandax Abd al-Aziz was taken captive with his family to Constantinople, where they were paraded at Nikephoros Phokas' triumphal procession. They were then given rich presents and an estate to settle by Romanos II, and the Byzantine sources report that the emperor considered making Abd al-Aziz a senator, but the latter refused to convert to Christianity. One of his sons, however, al-Nu'man, or Anemas in Greek, converted and entered Byzantine service until he was killed at the Siege of Dorostolon in 971. Some modern researchers consider it possible that the later Byzantine aristocratic family of Anemas descended from him.

It was shown in the Panorama section at the 66th Berlin International Film Festival. Plot A young Romanian woman, Elena, is hired as a housekeeper for a Danish couple, Louise and Kasper. While wealthy, the couple chooses to live in a lakehouse without electricity, grow their own food, and raise chickens. Their only connection to the outside world is a landline phone. Louise is recovering from surgery and requires some extra help around the house. Although Elena feels uncomfortable with the unusual isolation of the house, she otherwise fits in easily. She also meets Leo, a spiritual healer and friend of Louise who tries to help Louise recover more quickly by purging the bad energy from her body. Elena and Louise quickly bond, and Elena tells Louise that she is saving money so that she and her son, who currently live with Elena's parents, can have a home of their own. Louise in turn confides her difficulties in conceiving a child of her own. Louise asks if Elena would agree to be a surrogate mother for her and Kasper. In exchange, they would buy an apartment for Elena after she gave birth. To the chagrin of her parents, Elena agrees and is implanted with one of Louise's frozen eggs. Though assured by her doctor that everything is going fine, Elena begins to feel unusual after the implantation and notices a number of bizarre events: the chickens become terrified of her, she begins to hallucinate sounds and images, and she suffers from nightmares. In one of these, she gives birth to a dead baby; in another, a blood-drenched Louise talks to her about someone named \\"Shelley.\\" As the pregnancy progresses, Elena loses weight, is constantly exhausted, develops bloody gums, and experiences unusual and unwholesome pregnancy cravings that disturb her. Leo, trying to help Elena through her difficult pregnancy, senses bad energy coming from her belly. Elena believes that the baby is killing her, but when she voices her concerns to her doctor, she insists that the baby is healthy and that all her difficulties are normal. She also reveals that her baby is a girl, but when Elena asks to see an ultrasound, the machine mysteriously breaks down. As the pregnancy progresses, Elena's condition worsens until she is in almost constant pain, forcing Louise to become her caretaker. One night during a bath, Elena reacts with pain when the water touches her, causing her to snap and beat at her own belly while screaming that she wants the child out. Later that night, Louise finds Elena wandering around in a daze, having attacked and attempted to eat a live chicken from their coop. Louise fears that if Elena returns home, her parents will keep her and the baby forever. They agree to keep Elena at the lakehouse and care for her until the child is born, but one afternoon, when Louise leaves Elena unattended, she returns to find that Elena has attempted to give herself an abortion with a knitting needle. Elena dies of internal bleeding, but the baby is unharmed. Kasper and Louise name the baby Shelley and Louise instantly adores her. Shelley begins to demonstrate some of the same strange behavior as Elena: the chickens fear her, and she screams in pain when water is poured on her. When Leo visits the house, he senses such evil in Shelley that he is forced to flee, much to Louise's shock. Soon, Kasper also becomes uncomfortable around Shelley, insisting that she makes strange noises that Louise doesn't hear but which drive Kasper to a strange, shell-shocked state in which he becomes completely unresponsive, to the point that he does not even react when he accidentally cuts open his own leg while chopping wood. Louise believes none of this and is upset that Kasper doesn't seem to love their daughter. Louise wakes in the middle of the night to find Shelly missing. Rushing outside, she finds Shelley with Kaspar, who has shut them both in the car with the engine running in an apparent murder- suicide attempt via carbon monoxide. Louise rescues Shelley and murders Kasper by slamming his head repeatedly in the car door. Shaken, Louise sits on the bed with Shelley as an unidentified man in black stands in the room with them. Suddenly the man is gone. Louise and Shelley are left alone, with no explanation for the events of the film. Cast * Bj√∂rn Andr√©sen as Leo * Ellen Dorrit Petersen as Louise * Kenneth M.

The dust in NGC 2768 forms an intricate network of knots and filaments.Dusty detail in elliptical galaxy NGC 2768 8 April 2013, ESA/Hubble & NASA In the centre of the galaxy are two tiny, S-shaped symmetric jets. These two flows of material travel outwards from the galactic centre along curved paths, and are masked by the tangle of dark dust lanes that spans the body of the galaxy. These jets are a sign of a very active centre, where lies a supermassive black hole. This speeds up and sucks in gas from the nearby space, creating a stream of material swirling inwards towards the black hole known as an accretion disc. This disk throws off material in very energetic outbursts, creating structures like the jets. NGC 2768 has had one observed Type Ib supernova, designated SN2000ds, which occurred far from the nuclear region.

Wolfe Publishing Ltd. 1984. Atropa pallidiflora is the least well-known of the four currently accepted species of Atropa and is endemic to the remarkable Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests of Northern Iran, which can boast all the species of Atropa currently recognised, with the sole exception of the strictly Ibero-Maghrebi A.baetica.Rechinger, Karl Heinz and Sch√∂nbeck-Temesy, Eva 1972. Solanaceae. N¬∫ 100,102 pp. - a fascicle of Flora Iranica : Flora des iranischen Hochlandes und der umrahmenden Gebirge; Persien, Afghanistan, Teile von West-Pakistan, Nord-Iraq, Azerbaidjan, Turkmenistan (Translation : 'Flora Iranica : Flora of the Iranian Highlands and the mountain ranges adjoining; taking in Iran and Afghanistan, and including also parts of Pakistan, Northern Iraq, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan'). The binomial Atropa pallidiflora was published by Eva Sch√∂nbeck-Temesy in volume 100 ('Solanaceae') of Karl Heinz Rechinger's monumental Flora Iranica in 1972. The specific name pallidiflora signifies 'bearing flowers of a pale, wan or washed-out hue' and, while appropriate, is not especially evocative, given that the flowers of most Atropa species are far from vivid (only the flowers of the yellow-flowered form (as opposed to the green) of Atropa baetica could be said to have a colour that is cheerful rather than sombre). The flowers of A. pallidiflora, like those of A.baetica, vary from greenish to yellow, but, as the designation 'having pallid flowers' might suggest, the yellow in question is a dingy greenish-yellow that is far from ornamental. The geographical term 'Hyrcanian' in the common name signifies that the plant is native to what was once the satrapy of Hyrcania,Britannica 'Hyrcania' the name of which derives (via Ancient Greek) from an Iranian root meaning 'wolf' : Hyrcania is thus the 'Land of Wolves' ( - see also Gorgan).http://www.iranica.com Encyclopedia Iranica, online article on Gorgan The name is an apt one, since the Hyrcanian forests have long been known as a hunting ground (or, in modern parlance, 'ecosystem') of legendary richness and beauty : the lush forests could support an abundance of large, mammalian herbivores, which in turn could support an abundance of apex predators - notably the wolf, but also the Persian leopard and even the tiger. The word 'Hyrcanian' (also its variant form 'Hyrcan') will be familiar to any diligent reader of the works of William Shakespeare, as an epithet of the proverbially savage (but now, sadly, extinct) Caspian Tiger, known to the dramatist from his reading of the works of various Latin authors - who, in turn, were familiar with the Ancient Greek coinage 'Hyrcania' and the lands adjoining the Caspian Sea to which the place name referred. Regarding the richness of the Hyrcanian flora - of which Atropa pallidiflora is a noteworthy element - it is worth mentioning that the name of the modern Iranian province of Golestan (which constitutes the easternmost portion of ancient Hyrcania) has the delightful meanings of 'Rose Garden' and 'Land of Flowers'. Description Unusually for an Atropa species, A. pallidiflora is a shrub ('frutex' in the Latin description given in Flora Iranica - of which the following is a translation). Height 120‚Äì200 cm. Vegetative parts glabrous. Lower stems, in flowering part, more or less bent in zigzag fashion. Largest of lower leaves to 15.5 x 7.5 cm, ovate-lanceolate, widest at base, rarely oblong-lanceolate, rounded-cuneate or broadly cuneate at base, tip finely acuminate lengthwise, arched with lateral veins, blade decurrent into petiole by one fifth to one sixth of its length; lesser lower leaves half to a quarter the size of greater but of similar form, although often with a more rounded base and petioles growing progressively shorter up stem to point where uppermost leaves almost sessile. Upper leaves quickly diminished and narrowed, bases cuneate, the tips finely acuminate, the smaller ones greatly reduced, oblong-lanceolate becoming almost thread-like. Flowers sometimes solitary though often in pairs, the pedicels 1‚Äì2 cm (average 1.5 cm) in length, erect, puberulent-glandulose. Calyx circa 10‚Äì12 mm in length, set apart from tube of corolla, campanulate, puberulent-glandulose, divided approximately to the middle into triangular-acuminate lobes, the lobes being acuminate to hair-like and outspread-erect, in the fruiting stage 7‚Äì12 mm in length, ovate- triangular, outspread-stellate and reflexed. Corolla in the dry state 2-2.5 cm in length, more or less funnel-shaped to campanulate-urceolate with a greatly narrowed base, five-lobed (the lobes 6‚Äì7 mm in length), in texture marked irregularly with pits of ovate form, colour greenish to dirty greenish-yellow. Stamens of unequal length, somewhat exserted, bases of filaments woolly in region where united with lower part of corolla tube. Style longer than corolla. Berry 7‚Äì14 mm in diameter, globose-flattened, slightly umbonate and ribbed/lined, colour black-ish in the dry state (according to the testimony of Bornm√ºller, of a drab, yellow colour). Seeds 1.6-1.7 x 1.2-1.3 mm, angular- reniform, reticulate-foveolate (the partitions of the reticulations slightly wavy), of a brownish colour. Note: it is apparent from the above that Professor Sch√∂nbeck-Temesy was writing her description using only dry, herbarium specimens (i.e. had not seen a living specimen of the plant), since the qualification 'in the dry state' (in sicco) appears in said description twice - once regarding the average length of the corolla and again in the description of the colour of the berry (which the drying process appears to have changed from yellow to blackish). See also translation below of the Prof.'s note in German re. specimens lacking underground parts. Comparisons with other Atropa species Atropa pallidiflora differs from Atropa belladonna chiefly in its glabrescence (lack of hairs), also in its narrower leaves, its smaller yellow flowers with shorter pedicels and its smaller berries (always yellow, in the fresh state?) \\\\- from Atropa komarovii in its most often ovate- lanceolate leaves and its flowers often produced in pairs and having puberulent-glandulose pedicels. \\\\- and from Atropa acuminata in its leaves with very wide bases, its narrower (acuminate to hair-like) calyx lobes, the shorter pedicels of its flowers and the fact that, when in the early stages of fruiting, the calyces cover the berries to a lesser degree. Atropa pallidiflora is closer in its morphology to A.acuminata than to any of the other species in the genus. The description of A. pallidiflora as a shrub in Flora Iranica is curious, given that all the other Atropa species are herbaceous perennials of the type rhizomatous hemicryptophyte. Some light may be cast on this matter by a further note by Prof. Sch√∂nbeck-Temesy, which reads (in translation) 'The statement concerning the growth form (wuchsform) is based on a herbarium note, because the only voucher specimens available to me had been collected without underground parts'. The underground parts of a typical Atropa species would be rhizomes and their absence in the available specimens could conceivably have led (in part) to the designation of A.pallidiflora a woody rather than a herbaceous perennial. However, even allowing for the evidence of said herbarium note (made, presumably, by Dr. ≈Ωumer), the matter of the woodiness or otherwise of the species awaits clarification by the collection of more specimens and the photographing of the plant in its natural habitat. The resolution of this question is likely in the near future, thanks to the review of the genus Atropa which is currently in progress. Type The type specimen of Atropa pallidiflora (of which there is a black and white photograph in the relevant volume of Flora Iranica) was collected by Slovenian botanist (and colleague of Professor Sch√∂nbeck-Temesy) Dr. Majda ≈Ωumer (see also Majda) on 28 September 1965 at a locality in the province of Mazandaran, near the port city of Nowshahr, with an altitude of 40m above sea level. Note: Dr. ≈Ωumer's surname is rendered, throughout Flora Iranica, as 'Zhumer' (i.e. in the Latin alphabet, without the use of the Slovenian diacritic (overring) on the 'Z'). Distribution Atropa pallidiflora is confined to the central part of a narrow belt of temperate rainforest fringing the Southern shore of the Caspian Sea, stretching (travelling from West to East) from the Talysh Mountains of the extreme Southeast of Azerbaijan through the Iranian provinces of Gilan, Mazandaran and Golestan and petering out in two spurs of woodland in Iran's North Khorasan province. The Northern spur ends near the village of Ghosha Tapeh and the Southern near the village of Havar and neither is far from the Kopet Dag range marking the border between Iran and Turkmenistan - where another Atropa species Atropa komarovii Blin.and Shalyt. (not currently an accepted species) is to be found. Viewed on Google Earth, this richly-forested region (the Shomal) stands out in deep green, contrasting sharply with the arid tones of the bulk of the Iranian plateau to the South, and it comes as no surprise to learn that it constitutes essentially a 'hotter spot' within the Irano- Anatolian biodiversity hotspot, namely the Northern edge of the Elburz Range forest steppe ecoregion - which is to say the North slope of the Alborz mountains - benefitting from the moisture from the Caspian Sea. Atropa pallidiflora is found mainly (possibly even exclusively) in that portion of the Hyrcanian forest belt lying within the province of Mazandaran (see also Tabaristan), although it may occur also in the adjoining parts of eastern Gilan and western Golestan. Flora Iranica lists the following localities in Mazandaran : a) Karehsang (referable probably to the Karehsang Hydrological station in the valley of the Haraz River), b) Abanjarmahali, c) the type locality near Nowshahr, d) a locality between Abbasabad and Shahi, e) a locality to the south of Amol and lastly f) a locality to the south of Chalus. Although the number of localities listed for A. pallidiflora is small, a comparison of the respective altitudes of these with the altitudes of localities listed in Flora Iranica for other Atropa species leads to the tentative conclusion that it is the species with the most lowland distribution and thus, potentially, the species most vulnerable to habitat damage caused by a proliferation of urban sprawl in those areas of Mazandaran fringing the Caspian.

The platoon's attack reportedly took the German troops by surprise. The German troops were reportedly unable to initially offer serious resistance despite their numerical superiority. Turbin destroyed a heavy machine gun and 75mm artillery shells with a hand grenade. The German troops soon recovered from their surprise and made four counterattacks.

Plato's so-called unwritten doctrines are metaphysical theories ascribed to him by his students and other ancient philosophers but not clearly formulated in his writings. In recent research, they are sometimes known as Plato's 'principle theory' (German: Prinzipienlehre) because they involve two fundamental principles from which the rest of the system derives. Plato is thought to have orally expounded these doctrines to Aristotle and the other students in the Academy and they were afterwards transmitted to later generations. The credibility of the sources that ascribe these doctrines to Plato is controversial. They indicate that Plato believed certain parts of his teachings were not suitable for open publication. Since these doctrines could not be explained in writing in a way that would be accessible to general readers, their dissemination would lead to misunderstandings. Plato therefore supposedly limited himself to teaching the unwritten doctrines to his more advanced students in the Academy. The surviving evidence for the content of the unwritten doctrines is thought to derive from this oral teaching. In the middle of the twentieth century, historians of philosophy initiated a wide- ranging project aiming at systematically reconstructing the foundations of the unwritten doctrines. The group of researchers who led this investigation, which became well-known among classicists and historians, came to be called the 'T√ºbingen School' (in German: T√ºbinger Platonschule), because some of its leading members were based at the University of T√ºbingen in southern Germany. On the other hand, numerous scholars had serious reservations about the project or even condemned it altogether. Many critics thought the evidence and sources used in the T√ºbingen reconstruction were insufficient. Others even contested the existence of the unwritten doctrines or at least doubted their systematic character and considered them mere tentative proposals. The intense and sometimes polemical disputes between the advocates and critics of the T√ºbingen School were conducted on both sides with great energy. Advocates suggested it amounted to a 'paradigm shift' in Plato studies.  Key terms  Aristotle referred to Plato's 'unwritten doctrines' and discussed Plato's principle theory. The expression 'unwritten doctrines' (in Greek: ·ºÑŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒ± Œ¥œåŒ≥ŒºŒ±œÑŒ±, √°grapha d√≥gmata) refers to doctrines of Plato taught inside his school and was first used by his student Aristotle. In his treatise on physics, he wrote that Plato had used a concept in one dialogue differently than 'in the so-called unwritten doctrines.'See below and Aristotle, Physics, 209b13‚Äì15. Modern scholars who defend the authenticity of the unwritten doctrines ascribed to Plato lay stress on this ancient expression. They hold that Aristotle used the phrase 'so-called' not in any ironic sense, but neutrally. The scholarly literature sometimes also uses the term 'esoteric doctrines.' This has nothing to do with the meanings of 'esoteric' common today: it does not indicate a secret doctrine. For scholars, 'esoteric' indicates only that the unwritten doctrines were intended for a circle of philosophy students inside Plato's school (in Greek, 'esoteric' literally means 'inside the walls'). Presumably they had the necessary preparation and had already studied Plato's published doctrines, especially his Theory of Forms, which is called his 'exoteric doctrine' ('exoteric' means 'outside the walls' or perhaps 'for public consumption').For a general discussion of esotericism in ancient philosophy, see W. Burkert, Lore and Science in Ancient Pythagoreanism (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1972), pp. 19, 179 ff., etc. Modern advocates of the possibility of reconstructing the unwritten doctrines are often called in a short and casual way 'esotericists' and their skeptical opponents are thus 'anti-esotericists.'For example, in Konrad Gaiser: Platons esoterische Lehre. The T√ºbingen School is sometimes called the T√ºbingen School of Plato studies to distinguish it from an earlier 'T√ºbingen School' of theologians based at the same university. Some also refer to the 'T√ºbingen paradigm.' Since Plato's unwritten doctrines were also vigorously defended by the Italian scholar Giovanni Reale, who taught in Milan, some also refer to the 'T√ºbingen and Milanese School' of Plato interpretation. Reale introduced the term 'protology,' i.e., 'doctrine of the One,' for the unwritten doctrines, since the highest of the principles ascribed to Plato is known as the 'One.'For Reale's research, see Further Reading below.  Evidence and sources  The case for the unwritten doctrines involves two steps.See Dmitri Nikulin, ed., The Other Plato: The T√ºbingen Interpretation of Plato's Inner-Academic Teachings (Albany: SUNY, 2012), and Hans Joachim Kr√§mer and John R. Catan, Plato and the Foundations of Metaphysics: A Work on the Theory of the Principles and Unwritten Doctrines of Plato with a Collection of the Fundamental Documents (SUNY Press, 1990). The first step consists in the presentation of the direct and circumstantial evidence for the existence of special philosophical doctrines taught orally by Plato. This, it is claimed, shows that Plato's dialogues, which have all survived, do not contain all of his teaching, but only those doctrines suitable for dissemination by written texts. In the second step, the range of sources for the supposed content of the unwritten doctrines is evaluated and the attempt made to reconstruct a coherent philosophical system. = Arguments for the existence of the unwritten doctrines = Papirus Oxyrhynchus, with fragment of Plato's Republic The chief evidence and arguments for the existence of Plato's unwritten doctrines are the following: * Passages in Aristotle's Metaphysics and Physics, especially the one in the Physics where Aristotle explicitly refers to the 'so-called unwritten doctrines.'Aristotle, Physics, 209b13‚Äì15. Aristotle was for many years a student of Plato, and it is assumed that he was well-acquainted with the teaching activity in the Academy and thus a good informant. * The report of Aristoxenus, a student of Aristotle, about Plato's public lecture 'On the Good.'Aristoxenos, Elementa harmonica 2,30‚Äì31. According to Aristoxenus, Aristotle told him that the lecture contained mathematical and astronomical illustrations and Plato's theme was the 'One,' his highest principle. This together with the title of the lecture implies it dealt with the two principles at the heart of the unwritten doctrines. According to Aristotle's report, the philosophically unprepared audience met the lecture with incomprehension. Biblioth√®que Nationale, Gr. 1807) * The criticism of writing in Plato's dialogues (German: Schriftkritik).See ch. 1 of Hans Joachim Kr√§mer and John R. Catan, Plato and the Foundations of Metaphysics: A Work on the Theory of the Principles and Unwritten Doctrines of Plato with a Collection of the Fundamental Documents (SUNY Press, 1990). Many dialogues accepted as authentic are skeptical about the written word as a medium for transferring knowledge and express a preference for oral transmission. Plato's Phaedrus explains this position in detail. There the superiority of oral over written teaching for transmitting philosophy is grounded in the far greater flexibility of oral discourse, which is held to be a decisive advantage. Authors of texts cannot adapt to the level of knowledge and the needs of individual readers. Moreover, they cannot answer readers' questions and criticisms. These are only possible in conversation, which is alive and psychologically responsive. Written texts are mere images of speech. Writing and reading are thought not only to lead to a weakening of our minds, but also to be unsuited for communicating wisdom, which can only succeed in oral instruction. Written words are useful only as reminders for those who already know something but may have forgotten it. Literary activity is therefore portrayed as mere play. Personal discussions with students are essential and may permit words in various individualized ways to be inscribed in the soul. Only those who can teach in this way, the Phaedrus continues, can be considered true philosophers. In contrast, those authors who have nothing 'more precious' (Gk., timi≈çtera) than a written text, which they have long polished, are only authors or writers but not yet philosophers. The meaning here of the Greek for 'more precious' is debated but is thought to point toward the unwritten doctrines.Platon, Phaedrus 274b‚Äì278e. * The criticism of writing in Plato's Seventh Letter, whose authenticity is contested, is nonetheless accepted by the T√ºbingen School.See ch. 1 of Hans Joachim Kr√§mer and John R. Catan, Plato and the Foundations of Metaphysics: A Work on the Theory of the Principles and Unwritten Doctrines of Plato with a Collection of the Fundamental Documents (SUNY Press, 1990). There Plato asserts‚Äîif he is really the author‚Äîthat his teaching can only be communicated orally (at least, he says, that part of it he is 'serious' about). He emphatically says that there is no text capable of expressing his philosophy and never will be, since it cannot be communicated like other teachings. Real understanding in the soul, the letter continues, arises only from intense, common effort and a shared path in life. Deep insights occur suddenly, the way a spark flies up and lights a fire. Fixing thought in writing is damaging since it produces illusions in the minds of readers, who either despise what they do not understand or become arrogant about their superficial learning.Plato, Seventh Letter, 341b‚Äì342a. * The 'doctrine of reserve' in the dialogues. There are numerous passages in the dialogues in which an especially important theme is introduced but then not further discussed. In many cases, the conversation breaks off just where it approaches the crux of the issue. These often concern questions which are of fundamental significance for philosophy. The defenders of the T√ºbingen School interpret these instances of 'reserve' as pointers to the content of the unwritten doctrines, which cannot be directly handled in written dialogues.See ch. 7 of Hans Joachim Kr√§mer and John R. Catan, Plato and the Foundations of Metaphysics: A Work on the Theory of the Principles and Unwritten Doctrines of Plato with a Collection of the Fundamental Documents (SUNY Press, 1990). * The fact that it was common in antiquity to distinguish between 'exoteric' matters, suitable for open and public discussion, and 'esoteric' matters, suitable only for instruction within a school. Even Aristotle employed this distinction.Hans Joachim Kr√§mer: Die platonische Akademie und das Problem einer systematischen Interpretation der Philosophie Platons. * The widespread view in antiquity that the content of Plato's doctrines that had been reserved for oral transmission went significantly beyond the philosophy expressed in the dialogues.See Appendix 3 of Hans Joachim Kr√§mer and John R. Catan, Plato and the Foundations of Metaphysics: A Work on the Theory of the Principles and Unwritten Doctrines of Plato with a Collection of the Fundamental Documents (SUNY Press, 1990). * The unwritten doctrines are thought to be the logical consequence of Plato's supposed project of reducing multiplicity to unity and particularity to generality. Plato's Theory of Forms reduces the multiplicity of appearances to the relatively smaller multiplicity of the Forms that are their foundation. Within Plato's hierarchy of Forms, the many lower-level Forms of the species derive from and depend on the higher and more general Forms of each genus. This leads to the supposition that the introduction of Forms was only a step on the way from the maximum multiplicity of appearances to the greatest possible unity. Plato's thought naturally leads therefore to the consequence that the reduction of multiplicity to unity must be brought to a conclusion, and this must occur in the unpublished theory of his highest principles.Michael Erler: Platon, M√ºnchen 2006, pp. 162‚Äì164; Detlef Thiel: Die Philosophie des Xenokrates im Kontext der Alten Akademie, M√ºnchen 2006, pp. 143‚Äì148. = The ancient sources for the reconstruction = Aristotle, his student Theophrastus, and Strato of Lampsacus (National and Kapodistrian University of Athens). If the Seventh Letter is authentic, Plato sharply disapproved of disclosing the contents of the supposed unwritten doctrines in writing. However, no obligation to remain silent was imposed upon the 'initiated.' The 'esoteric' character of the teachings should not be understood as a requirement to keep them secret or as a ban on writing about them. Indeed, students in the Academy did later publish writings about the unwritten doctrines or reuse them in their own works.SeeMichael Erler: Platon (= Hellmut Flashar, ed.) This 'indirect tradition,' the evidence drawn from other ancient authors, supplies a basis for the reconstruction of doctrines that Plato communicated only orally. The following sources are most frequently used for reconstructing Plato's unwritten doctrines: * Aristotle's Metaphysics (books Œë, Œú and N) and Physics (book Œî) * Fragments of Aristotle's lost treatises 'On the Good' and 'On Philosophy' * The Metaphysics of Theophrastus, a student of Aristotle * Two fragments of the lost treatise On Plato by Plato's student Hermodorus of SyracuseText and German translation in Heinrich D√∂rrie, Matthias Baltes: Der Platonismus in der Antike, Band 1, Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt 1987, pp. 82‚Äì86, commentary pp. 296‚Äì302. * A fragment from a lost work of Plato's student SpeusippusText and German translation in Heinrich D√∂rrie, Matthias Baltes: Der Platonismus in der Antike, Band 1, Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt 1987, pp. 86‚Äì89, commentary pp. 303‚Äì305. * The treatise Against Mathematicians of Sextus Empiricus (10 books). Sextus does not there explicitly ascribe the doctrines to Plato but describes them as Pythagorean. Modern scholars have assembled evidence, however, that Plato was in fact their author.See Heinz Happ: Hyle, Berlin 1971, pp. 140‚Äì142; Marie-Dominique Richard: L‚Äôenseignement oral de Platon, 2. * Plato's Republic and Parmenides. The principles ascribed to Plato in the indirect tradition make many of the statements and trains of thought in these two dialogues appear in a different light. Interpreted accordingly, they contribute to sharpening the contours of our image of the unwritten doctrines. The debates in other dialogues, for example, the Timaeus and the Philebus, can then be understood in new ways and incorporated into the T√ºbingen reconstruction. Allusions to the unwritten doctrines can even be found, it is argued, in Plato's early dialogues.Jens Halfwassen: Der Aufstieg zum Einen.  The supposed content of the unwritten doctrines  The advocates of the T√ºbingen School have intensively examined the scattered evidence and testimony in the sources in order to reconstruct the principles of Plato's unwritten doctrines. They see in these teachings the core of Plato's philosophy and have reached a fairly settled picture of their fundamentals, though many important details remain unknown or controversial.There is an overview in Michael Erler: Platon (= Hellmut Flashar, ed.) A notable feature of the T√ºbingen paradigm is the contention that the unwritten doctrines are not unrelated to the written doctrines, rather there is a close and logical connection between them. Insofar as the T√ºbingen interpretation corresponds to the authentic teaching of Plato, it shows that his principles opened up a new path in metaphysics. His Theory of Forms opposes many views of the Eleatics, a school of Pre-Socratic philosophy. The principles at the foundation of Plato's unwritten doctrines indeed break with the convictions of the Eleatics, who held that only perfect, unchanging Being exists. Plato's principles replace this Being with a new concept of Absolute Transcendence, that is somehow higher than Being. They posit a sphere of absolutely perfect, 'Transcendental Being' beyond the being of ordinary things. 'Transcendental Being' thus somehow exists at a higher level than ordinary things. According to this model, all familiar kinds of being are in a certain way imperfect, since the descent from Transcendental Being to ordinary being involves a restriction of the original, absolute perfection.See ch. 6 of Hans Joachim Kr√§mer and John R. Catan, Plato and the Foundations of Metaphysics: A Work on the Theory of the Principles and Unwritten Doctrines of Plato with a Collection of the Fundamental Documents (SUNY Press, 1990). = The two fundamental principles and their interaction = In Plato's Allegory of the Cave, we are like prisoners chained in a cave who see only the shadows cast by the Forms and think the shadows, rather than the hidden Forms, are real. Painting of Plato's cave by Michiel Coxie, circa 1540. Plato's Theory of Forms asserts that the world which appears to our senses derives from the perfect, unchanging Forms. For him the realm of the Forms is an objective, metaphysical reality, which is independent of the lower sort of Being in the ordinary objects we perceive with our senses. For Plato, the Forms, not the objects of sense, are real Being: strictly, they and not the objects we experience are reality. Thus the Forms are the really existing things. As models for the individual objects we sense, the Forms cause ordinary objects to appear the way they do and lend them some secondary kind of existence.For an overview of the Theory of Forms, see P. Friedlander, Plato: an Introduction (Princeton, Princeton University Press, 2015). Just as the Theory of Forms in Plato's published dialogues is supposed to explain the existence and features of the world of appearances, the two principles of the unwritten doctrines are supposed to explain the existence and features of the realm of the Forms. The Theory of Forms and the principles of the unwritten doctrines fit together in a way that provides a unified theory of all existence. The existence of the Forms as well as the objects we sense are derived from two fundamental principles.Giovanni Reale: Zu einer neuen Interpretation Platons, 2. The two fundamental 'ur-principles' that are thought to constitute the basis of Plato's unwritten doctrines are : * The One: the principle of unity that makes things definite and determinate * The Indefinite Dyad: the principle of 'indeterminacy' and 'unlimitedness' (Gk., ah√≥ristos dy√°s) Plato is said to have described the Indefinite Dyad as 'the Great and the Small' (Gk., to m√©ga kai to mikr√≥n).Aristotle, Metaphysics 987b. This is the principle or source of more and less, of excess and deficiency, of ambiguity and indefiniteness, and of multiplicity. It does not imply unlimitedness in the sense of a spatial or quantitative infinity; instead, the indefiniteness consists in a lack of determinateness and therefore of fixed form. The Dyad is called 'indefinite' to distinguish it from definite two-ness, i.e., the number two, and to indicate that the Dyad stands above mathematics.Florian Calian: One, Two, Three‚Ä¶ A Discussion on the Generation of Numbers in Plato‚Äôs Parmenides; Giovanni Reale: Zu einer neuen Interpretation Platons, 2. The One and the Indefinite Dyad are the ultimate ground of everything because the realm of Plato's Forms and the totality of reality derive from their interaction. The whole manifold of sensory phenomena rests in the end on only two factors. Form issues from the One, which is the productive factor; the formless Indefinite Dyad serves as the substrate for the activity of the One. Without such a substrate, the One could produce nothing. All Being rests upon the action of the One upon the Indefinite Dyad. This action sets limits to the formless, gives it Form and particularity, and is therefore also the principle of individuation that brings separate entities into existence. A mixture of both principles underlies all Being.Heinrich D√∂rrie, Matthias Baltes: Der Platonismus in der Antike, Band 4, Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt 1996, pp. 154‚Äì162 (texts and translation), 448‚Äì458 (commentary); Michael Erler: Platon (= Hellmut Flashar, ed.) Depending upon which principle dominates in a thing, either order or disorder reigns. The more chaotic something is, the more strongly the presence of the Indefinite Dyad is at work.Hans Joachim Kr√§mer: Arete bei Platon und Aristoteles, Heidelberg 1959, p. 144 ff.; Konrad Gaiser: Platons ungeschriebene Lehre, 3. According to the T√ºbingen interpretation, the two opposing principles determine not only the ontology of Plato's system, but also its logic, ethics, epistemology, political philosophy, cosmology, and psychology.For an overview, see Hans Joachim Kr√§mer and John R. Catan, Plato and the Foundations of Metaphysics: A Work on the Theory of the Principles and Unwritten Doctrines of Plato with a Collection of the Fundamental Documents (SUNY Press, 1990). In ontology the opposition of the two principles corresponds to the opposition between Being and Not-Being. The more the Indefinite Dyad influences a thing, the less it has of Being and the lower its ontological rank. In logic, the One supplies identity and equality, while the Indefinite Dyad supplies difference and inequality. In ethics, the One signifies Goodness (or virtue, aret·∏ó), while the Indefinite Dyad signifies Badness. In politics, the One gives to a populace that which makes it into a unified political entity and enables it to survive, while the Indefinite Dyad leads to faction, chaos, and dissolution. In cosmology, the One is evidenced by rest, persistence, and the eternality of the world, as well as the presence of life in the cosmos and the pre-determined activity of the Demiurge Plato mentions in his Timaeus. The Indefinite Dyad is in cosmology the principle of movement and change, and especially of impermanence and death. In epistemology, the One stands for philosophical knowledge that rests upon acquaintance with Plato's unchanging Forms, while the Indefinite Dyad stands for mere opinion that is dependent upon sensory impressions. In psychology or the theory of the soul, the One corresponds to Reason, and the Indefinite Dyad to the sphere of instinct and bodily affects.Konrad Gaiser: Platons ungeschriebene Lehre, 3. = Monism and dualism = The Clarke Plato, 895 CE (Oxford, 1 recto). Positing two fundamental principles raises the question of whether the unwritten doctrines and therefore‚Äîin the case they are authentic‚Äîof whether the whole of Plato's philosophy is monistic or dualistic.For an overview, see Hans Joachim Kr√§mer and John R. Catan, Plato and the Foundations of Metaphysics: A Work on the Theory of the Principles and Unwritten Doctrines of Plato with a Collection of the Fundamental Documents (SUNY Press, 1990). A philosophical system is monistic in the case when the opposition between the One and the Indefinite Dyad is founded upon a single, more fundamental principle. This occurs if the principle of multiplicity somehow reduces to the principle of unity and is subordinated to it. An alternative, monistic interpretation of the unwritten doctrines posits a higher 'meta-One' that serves as the foundation of both principles and unites them. If the Indefinite Dyad is, however, understood as an independent principle distinct from any sort of unity, then Plato's unwritten doctrines are in the end dualistic. The evidence in the ancient sources does not make clear how the relation between the two principles should be understood. They do, however, consistently accord the One a higher status than the Indefinite DyadChristina Schefer: Platons unsagbare Erfahrung, Basel 2001, p. 186 ff. and consider only the One as absolutely transcendent. This implies a monistic interpretation of the two principles and fits with assertions in the dialogues that suggest a monistic philosophy. Plato's Meno says that everything in nature is related,Plato, Meno 81c‚Äìd. and the Republic states that there is an origin (arch·∏ó) for all things, which can be grasped by reason.Plato, Republic 511b. The opinions of advocates of the T√ºbingen interpretation are divided on this question.There is a literature review in Michael Erler: Platon (= Hellmut Flashar, ed.). Most favor resolving the dispute by concluding that, although Plato indeed considered the Indefinite Dyad as the indispensable and fundamental element of our ordered world, he nonetheless posited the One as some higher, overarching principle of unity. This would make Plato a monist. This position has been defended at length by Jens Halfwassen, Detlef Thiel, and Vittorio H√∂sle.Jens Halfwassen: Monismus und Dualismus in Platons Prinzipienlehre. Halfwassen asserts it is impossible to derive the Indefinite Dyad from the One since it would thereby lose its status as a fundamental principle. Moreover, an absolute and transcendental One could not contain any sort of latent multiplicity in itself. The Indefinite Dyad, however, would therefore not have an equal origin and equal power as the One, but is nonetheless dependent upon the One. According to Halfwassen's interpretation, therefore, Plato's philosophy is in the end monistic. John Niemeyer Findlay likewise makes the case for an emphatically monistic understanding of the two principles.John N. Findlay: Plato. Cornelia de Vogel also finds the monistic aspect of the system dominant.Cornelia J. de Vogel: Rethinking Plato and Platonism, Leiden 1986, p. 83 ff., 190‚Äì206. Two leading figures of the T√ºbingen School, Hans Joachim Kr√§merHans Joachim Kr√§mer: Der Ursprung der Geistmetaphysik, 2. und Konrad GaiserKonrad Gaiser: Platons ungeschriebene Lehre, 3. conclude that Plato has a single system with both monistic and dualistic aspects. Christina Schefer proposes that the opposition between the principles is logically irresolvable and points to something beyond them both. According to her, the opposition stems from some fundamental, 'ineffable' intuition that Plato experienced: namely, that the god Apollo is the common ground of both the One and the Indefinite Dyad.Christina Schefer: Platons unsagbare Erfahrung, Basel 2001, pp. 57‚Äì60. This theory also leads therefore to a monistic conception. According to the prevailing view of researchers today, although the two principles are considered elements of a finally monistic system, they also have a dualistic aspect. This is not contested by defenders of the monistic interpretation but they assert the dualistic aspect is subordinated to a totality that is monistic. Its dualistic nature remains because not only the One but also the Indefinite Dyad is treated as a fundamental principle. Giovanni Reale emphasized the role of the Dyad as a fundamental origin. He thought, however, that the concept of dualism was inappropriate and spoke of a 'bipolar structure of reality.' For him, however, these two 'poles' were not equally significant: the One 'remains hierarchically superior to the Dyad.'Giovanni Reale: Zu einer neuen Interpretation Platons, 2. Heinz Happ,Heinz Happ: Hyle, Berlin 1971, pp. 141‚Äì143. Marie-Dominique Richard,Marie-Dominique Richard: L‚Äôenseignement oral de Platon, 2. and Paul WilpertPaul Wilpert: Zwei aristotelische Fr√ºhschriften √ºber die Ideenlehre, Regensburg 1949, pp. 173‚Äì174. argued against every derivation of the Dyad from a superior principle of unity, and consequently contended that Plato's system was dualistic. They believe that Plato's originally dualistic system was later reinterpreted as a kind of monism. This bust is often identified as Plotinus (c. 205 ‚Äì 270 CE), the leading Neo- Platonist. If the two principles are authentically Plato's and the monistic interpretation is correct, then Plato's metaphysics strongly resembles the Neo-Platonic systems of the Roman Imperial period. In this case, the Neo- Platonic reading of Plato is, at least in this central area, historically justified. This implies that Neo-Platonism is less of an innovation than it appears without the recognition of Plato's unwritten doctrines. Advocates of the T√ºbingen School emphasize this advantage of their interpretation. They see Plotinus, the founder of Neo-Platonism, as advancing a tradition of thought begun by Plato himself. Plotinus's metaphysics, at least in broad outline, was therefore already familiar to the first generation of Plato's students. This confirms Plotinus' own view, for he considered himself not the inventor of a system but the faithful interpreter of Plato's doctrines.Detlef Thiel: Die Philosophie des Xenokrates im Kontext der Alten Akademie, M√ºnchen 2006, p. 197f . and note 64; Jens Halfwassen: Der Aufstieg zum Einen. = The Good in the unwritten doctrines = An important research problem is the controversial question of the status of the Form of the Good within the metaphysical system derived from a combination of the Theory of Forms and the two principles of the reconstruction. The resolution of this issue depends upon how one interprets the status Plato gives to the Good in his Theory of Forms. Some believe that Plato's Republic sharply contrasts the Good and the usual Forms, and gives the Good a uniquely high rank. This accords with his conviction that all the other Forms owe their Being to the Form of the Good, and are thus ontologically subordinated to it.A collection of relevant passages from the Republic in Thomas Alexander Szlez√°k: Die Idee des Guten in Platons Politeia, Sankt Augustin 2003, p. 111 ff. For an overview of the positions in the research controversy see Rafael Ferber: Ist die Idee des Guten nicht transzendent oder ist sie es doch? The starting point of the scholarly controversy is the disputed meaning of the Greek concept of ousia. This is an ordinary Greek word and literally means 'being.' In philosophical contexts, it is usually translated by 'Being' or 'Essence.' Plato's Republic says that the Good is 'not ousia' but is rather 'beyond ousia' and surpasses it as an originThe Greek presbe√≠a, 'rank accorded to age,' is also translated 'worth.' and in power.Platon, Republic, 509b. If this passage implies only that the essence or nature of the Good is beyond Being (but not the Good itself), or if the passage is just interpreted loosely, then the Form of the Good can retain its place inside the realm of the Forms, i.e., the realm of things with real Being. In this case the Good is not absolutely transcendent: it does not transcend Being and somehow exist above it. The Good would therefore have a place in the hierarchy of real Beings.The transcendental being of the Form of the Good is denied by, among others, Theodor Ebert: Meinung und Wissen in der Philosophie Platons, Berlin 1974, pp. 169‚Äì173, Matthias Baltes: Is the Idea of the Good in Plato‚Äôs Republic Beyond Being? According to this interpretation, the Good is not an issue for the two principles of the unwritten doctrines but only for the Theory of Forms. On the other hand, if the passage in the Republic is read literally and 'ousia' means 'Being,' then the phrase 'beyond Being' implies the Good actually transcends Being.A collection of presentations of this position is in Thomas Alexander Szlez√°k: Die Idee des Guten in Platons Politeia, Sankt Augustin 2003, p. 67 ff. According to this interpretation, Plato considered the Good to be absolutely transcendent and it must be integrated into the realm of the two principles. If Plato considered the Good as transcendent, there is a problem about its relation to the One. Most proponents of the authenticity of the unwritten doctrines hold that the Good and the One were for Plato identical. According to their arguments, the identity follows from the nature of Absolute Transcendence, since it brooks no determinations of any kind and therefore also no distinction between the Good and the One as two separate principles. In addition, defenders of such an identity draw on evidence in Aristotle.Jens Halfwassen: Der Aufstieg zum Einen. A contrary view, however, is held by Rafael Ferber, who accepts that the unwritten doctrines are authentic and that they are concerned with the Good but denies that the Good and the One are identical.Rafael Ferber: Platos Idee des Guten, 2., erweiterte Auflage, Sankt Augustin 1989, pp. 76‚Äì78. = Forms of numbers = Excavations in Athens near the site of Plato's Academy, where the unwritten doctrines were supposedly debated. It can be inferred from the report of Aristoxenus about Plato's lecture 'On the Good,' that a discussion of the nature of numbers occupied an important part of Plato's argument.Aristoxenos, Elementa harmonica 30. This theme accordingly played an important role in the unwritten doctrines. This involved, however, not mathematics but a philosophy of numbers. Plato distinguished between the numbers used in mathematics and the metaphysical Forms of numbers. In contrast to the numbers used in mathematics, the Forms of numbers do not consist of groups of units and so cannot be added together or subjected to the ordinary operations of arithmetic. The Form of Twoness, for example, does not consist of two units designated by the number 2 but rather the real essence of twoness.Giovanni Reale: Zu einer neuen Interpretation Platons, 2. According to defenders of the unwritten doctrines, Plato gave the Forms of Numbers a middle position between the two fundamental principles and the other, ordinary Forms. Indeed, these Forms of Numbers are the first entities to emerge from the One and the Indefinite Dyad. This emergence is‚Äîas with all metaphysical production‚Äînot to be understood as the result of a temporal process but rather as an ontological dependence. For example, the interaction of the One (the determining factor) and the Dyad (the source of multiplicity) leads to the Form of Twoness in the realm of the Forms of Numbers. As the product of both principles, the Form of Twoness reflects the nature of both: it is determinate twoness. Its fixed and determinate nature is shown by its expression of the relation between the Form of Doubleness (a determinate excess) and the Form of Halfness (a determinate deficiency). The Form of Twoness is not a group of units like the numbers used in mathematics but rather a connection between two magnitudes, one of which is double the other.Giovanni Reale: Zu einer neuen Interpretation Platons, 2. The One acts as the determining factor on the Indefinite Dyad, which is called 'the Great and the Small,' and eliminates its indeterminacy, which encompasses every possible relation between largeness and smallness or between excess and deficiency. Thus the One produces determinate relations between magnitudes by making the indeterminacy of the Indefinite Dyad determinate, and just these relations are understood by advocates of the unwritten doctrines to be the Forms of Numbers. This is the origin of determinate Twoness, which can from various perspectives be seen as the Form of Doubleness or the Form of Halfness. The other Forms of Numbers are derived in the same way out of the two fundamental principles. The structure of space is implicit in the Forms of Numbers: the dimensions of space somehow emerge from their relations. Key details of this extra-temporal emergence of space are missing from the surviving ancient testimonies, and its nature is debated in the scholarly literature.Giovanni Reale: Zu einer neuen Interpretation Platons, 2. = Epistemological issues = Herm of Plato. The Greek inscription reads 'Plato [son] of Ariston, Athenian' (Rome, Capitoline Museum, 288). Plato believed that only experts in 'dialectics,' i.e., philosophers who follow his logical methods, are competent to make statements about the highest principle. Thus he would have developed the theory of the two principles‚Äîif indeed it is his‚Äîdiscursively in discussions and grounded it in argument. From these discussions, it emerged that a highest principle is necessary for his system, and that the One must be inferred indirectly from its effects. Whether and to what degree Plato in addition held it possible to have direct access to the sphere of the absolute and transcendental One or indeed ever claimed such a thing is debated in the literature. This poses the question of whether the assertion of transcendental Being also entails the possibility of knowledge of that higher Being, or whether the highest principle is known theoretically but not in any more direct way.An overview of the relevant scholarly debate in Michael Erler: Platon (= Hellmut Flashar, ed.) If human understanding were restricted to discursive or verbal arguments, then Plato's dialectical discussions could at most have reached the conclusion that the highest principle was demanded by his metaphysics but also that human understanding could never arrive at that transcendental Being. If so, the only remaining way that the One might be reached (and the Good, if that is the same as the One) is through the possibility of some nonverbal, 'intuitive' access.Konrad Gaiser: Platons ungeschriebene Lehre, 3. It is debated whether or not Plato in fact took this route. If he did, he thereby renounced the possibility of justifying every step made by our knowledge with philosophical arguments that can be expressed discursively in words. At least in regards to the One, Michael Erler concludes from a statement in the Republic that Plato held it was only intuitively knowable.Michael Erler: Platon (= Hellmut Flashar, ed.) In contrast, Peter Stemmer,Peter Stemmer: Platons Dialektik. Kurt von Fritz,Kurt von Fritz: Beitr√§ge zu Aristoteles, Berlin 1984, p. 56f. J√ºrgen Villers,J√ºrgen Villers: Das Paradigma des Alphabets. and others oppose any independent role for non-verbal intuition. Jens Halfwassen believes that knowledge of the realm of the Forms rests centrally upon direct intuition, which he understands as unmediated comprehension by some non-sensory, 'inner perception' (Ger., Anschauung). He also, however, holds that Plato's highest principle transcended knowledge and was thus inaccessible to such intuition. For Plato, the One would therefore make knowledge possible and give it the power of knowing things, but would itself remain unknowable and ineffable.Jens Halfwassen: Der Aufstieg zum Einen. Christina Schefer argues that both Plato's written and unwritten doctrines deny any and every kind of philosophical access to transcendental Being. Plato nonetheless found such access along a different path: in an ineffable, religious experience of the appearance or theophany of the god Apollo.Christina Schefer: Platons unsagbare Erfahrung, Basel 2001, p. 60 ff. In the center of Plato's worldview, she argues, stood neither the Theory of Forms nor the principles of the unwritten doctrines but rather the experience of Apollo, which since it was non-verbal could not have grounded any verbal doctrines. The T√ºbingen interpretation of Plato's principles, she continues, correctly makes them an important component of Plato's philosophy, but they lead to insoluble puzzles and paradoxes (Gk., aporiai) and therefore are ultimately a dead end.Christina Schefer: Platons unsagbare Erfahrung, Basel 2001, pp. 5‚Äì62. It should be inferred from Plato's statements that he nonetheless found a way out, a way that leads beyond the Theory of Forms. In this interpretation, even the principles of the unwritten doctrines are to a degree merely provisional means to an end.For a different view see Hans Joachim Kr√§mer: Arete bei Platon und Aristoteles, Heidelberg 1959, p. 464 ff. The scholarly literature is broadly divided on the question of whether or not Plato regarded the principles of the unwritten doctrines as certainly true. The T√ºbingen School attributes an epistemological optimism to Plato. This is especially emphasized by Hans Kr√§mer. His view is that Plato himself asserted the highest possible claim to certainty for knowledge of the truth of his unwritten doctrines. He calls Plato, at least in regard to his two principles, a 'dogmatist.' Other scholars and especially Rafael Ferber uphold the opposing view that for Plato the unwritten doctrines were advanced only as a hypothesis that could be wrong.Rafael Ferber: Hat Plato in der \\"ungeschriebenen Lehre\\" eine \\"dogmatische Metaphysik und Systematik\\" vertreten? Konrad Gaiser argues that Plato formulated the unwritten doctrines as a coherent and complete philosophical system but not as a 'Summa of fixed dogmas preached in a doctrinaire way and announced as authoritative.' Instead, he continues, they were something for critical examination that could be improved: a model proposed for continuous, further development.Konrad Gaiser: Prinzipientheorie bei Platon. For Plato it is essential to bind epistemology together with ethics. He emphasizes that a student's access to insights communicated orally is possible only to those souls whose character fulfills the necessary prerequisites. The philosopher who engages in oral instruction must always ascertain whether the student has the needed character and disposition. According to Plato, knowledge is not won simply by grasping things with the intellect; instead, it is achieved as the fruit of prolonged efforts made by the entire soul. There must be an inner affinity between what is communicated and the soul receiving the communication.Christina Schefer: Platons unsagbare Erfahrung, Basel 2001, pp. 49‚Äì56.  The question of dating and historical development  Professor Paul Shorey, here at the University of Chicago circa 1909, was a prominent advocate for unitarianism in Plato studies and Harold Cherniss's teacher. It is debated when Plato held his public lecture 'On the Good.'An overview of the opposed positions is in Marie- Dominique Richard: L‚Äôenseignement oral de Platon, 2. For the advocates of the T√ºbingen interpretation this is connected with the question of whether the unwritten doctrines belong to Plato's later philosophy or were worked out relatively early in his career. Resolving this question depends in turn upon the long-standing debate in Plato studies between 'unitarians' and 'developmentalists.' The unitarians maintain that Plato always defended a single, coherent metaphysical system throughout his career; developmentalists distinguish several different phases in Plato's thought and hold that he was forced by problems he encountered while writing the dialogues to revise his system in significant ways. In the older literature, the prevailing view was that Plato's lecture took place at the end of Plato's life. The origin of his unwritten doctrines was therefore assigned to the final phase of his philosophical activity. In more recent literature, an increasing number of researchers favor dating the unwritten doctrines to an earlier period. This clashes with the suppositions of the unitarians. Whether or not Plato's early dialogues allude to the unwritten dialogues is contested.For a history of the scholarship, see Michael Erler: Platon (= Hellmut Flashar, ed.) The older view that Plato's public lecture occurred late in Plato's career has been energetically denied by Hans Kr√§mer. He argues that the lecture was held in the early period of Plato's activity as a teacher. Moreover, he says, the lecture was not given in public only once. It is more probable, he says, that there was a series of lectures and only the first introductory lecture was, as an experiment, open to a broad and unprepared audience. After the failure of this public debut, Plato drew the conclusion that his doctrines should only be shared with philosophy students. The lecture on the Good and the ensuing discussions formed part of an ongoing series of talks, in which Plato regularly over the period of several decades made his students familiar with the unwritten doctrines. He was holding these sessions already by the time of this first trip to Sicily (c. 389/388) and thus before he founded the Academy.Hans Joachim Kr√§mer: Arete bei Platon und Aristoteles, Heidelberg 1959, pp. 20‚Äì24, 404‚Äì411, 444. Those historians of philosophy who date the lecture to a later time have proposed several different possible periods: between 359/355 (Karl-Heinz Ilting),Karl-Heinz Ilting: Platons ‚ÄöUngeschriebene Lehren‚Äò: der Vortrag ‚Äö√ºber das Gute‚Äò. between 360/358 (Hermann Schmitz),Hermann Schmitz: Die Ideenlehre des Aristoteles, Band 2: Platon und Aristoteles, Bonn 1985, pp. 312‚Äì314, 339f. around 352 (Detlef Thiel),Detlef Thiel: Die Philosophie des Xenokrates im Kontext der Alten Akademie, M√ºnchen 2006, pp. 180f. and the time between the death of Dion(354) and Plato's own death (348/347: Konrad Gaiser). Gaiser emphasizes that the late date of the lecture does not entail that the unwritten doctrines were a late development. He rather finds that these doctrines were from early on a part of the Academy's curriculum, probably as early as the founding of the school.Konrad Gaiser: Gesammelte Schriften, Sankt Augustin 2004, pp. 280‚Äì282, 290, 304, 311. It is unclear why Plato presented such demanding material as the unwritten doctrines to a public not yet educated in philosophy and was thereby met‚Äîas could not be otherwise‚Äîwith incomprehension. Gaiser supposes that he opened the lectures to the public in order to confront distorted reports of the unwritten doctrines and thereby to deflate the circulating rumors that the Academy was a hive of subversive activity.Konrad Gaiser: Plato‚Äôs enigmatic lecture ‚ÄöOn the Good‚Äò.  Reception = Influence before the early modern period = Among the first generations of Plato's students, there was a living memory of Plato's oral teaching, which was written up by many of them and influenced the literature of the period (much of which no longer survives today). The unwritten doctrines were vigorously criticized by Aristotle, who examined them in two treatises named 'On the Good' and 'On Philosophy' (of which we have only a few fragments) and in other works such as his Metaphysics and Physics. Aristotle's student Theophrastus also discussed them in his Metaphysics.See however, difficulties with Theophrastus' interpretation in Margherita Isnardi Parente: Th√©ophraste, Metaphysica 6 a 23 ss. Bust of Marsilio Ficino in the cathedral in Florence (by A. Ferrucci, 1521). He seems to play his translation of Plato like a lyre. In the following Hellenistic Period (323‚Äì31 BCE) when a thorough-going skepticism came to dominate the Academy, the inheritance of Plato's unwritten doctrines could attract little interest (if they were known at all). This skepticism faded by the time of Middle Platonism and Neo-Platonism, but the philosophers of this period seem no better informed about the unwritten doctrines than modern scholars.Konrad Gaiser: Prinzipientheorie bei Platon. After the rediscovery in the Renaissance of the original text of Plato's dialogues (which had been lost in the Middle Ages), the early modern period was dominated by an image of Plato's metaphysics influenced by a combination of Neo-Platonism and Aristotle's reports of the basics of the unwritten doctrines. The Humanist Marsilio Ficino (1433‚Äì1499) and his Neo-Platonic interpretation decisively contributed to the prevailing view with his translations and commentaries. Later, the influential popularizer, writer, and Plato translator Thomas Taylor (1758‚Äì1835) reinforced this Neo-Platonic tradition of Plato interpretation. The Eighteenth century increasingly saw the Neo-Platonic paradigm as problematic but was unable to replace it with a consistent alternative.Giovanni Reale: Zu einer neuen Interpretation Platons, 2. The unwritten doctrines were still accepted in this period. The German philosopher Wilhelm Gottlieb Tennemann proposed in his 1792‚Äì95 System of Plato's Philosophy that Plato had never intended that his philosophy should be entirely represented in written form. = Nineteenth century = In the nineteenth century a scholarly debate began that continues to this day over the question of whether unwritten doctrines must be considered and over whether they constitute a philosophical inheritance that adds something new to the dialogues. Friedrich Schleiermacher The Neo-Platonic interpretation of Plato prevailed until the beginning the nineteenth century when in 1804 Friedrich Schleiermacher published an introduction to his 1804 translation of Plato's dialoguesFriedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher: √úber die Philosophie Platons, ed. by Peter M. Steiner, Hamburg 1996, pp. 21‚Äì119. and initiated a radical turn whose consequences are still felt today. Schleiermacher was convinced that the entire content of Plato's philosophy was contained in his dialogues. There never was, he insisted, any oral teaching that went beyond them. According to his conception, the genre of the dialogue is no literary replacement for Plato's philosophy, rather the literary form of the dialogue and the content of Plato's philosophy are inseparably bound together: Plato's way of philosophizing can by its nature only be represented as a literary dialogue. Therefore, unwritten doctrines with any philosophically relevant, special content that are not bound together into a literary dialogue must be excluded.See Thomas Alexander Szlez√°k: Schleiermachers \\"Einleitung\\" zur Platon-√úbersetzung von 1804. Schleiermacher's conception was rapidly and widely accepted and became the standard view.Gyburg Radke: Das L√§cheln des Parmenides, Berlin 2006, pp. 1‚Äì5. Its many advocates include Eduard Zeller, a leading historian of philosophy in the nineteenth century, whose influential handbook The Philosophy of the Greeks and its Historical Development militated against 'supposed secret doctrines' and had lasting effects on the reception of Plato's works. Schleiermacher's stark denial of any oral teaching was disputed from the beginning but his critics remained isolated. In 1808, August Boeckh, who later became a well-known Greek scholar, stated in an edition of Schleiermacher's Plato translations that he did not find the arguments against the unwritten doctrines persuasive. There was a great probability, he said, that Plato had an esoteric teaching never overtly expressed but only darkly hinted at: 'what he here [in the dialogues] did not carry out to the final point, he there in oral instruction placed the topmost capstone on.'August Boeckh: Kritik der Uebersetzung des Platon von Schleiermacher. Christian August Brandis collected and commented upon the ancient sources for the unwritten doctrines.Christian August Brandis: Diatribe academica de perditis Aristotelis libris de ideis et de bono sive philosophia, Bonn 1823. Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg and Christian Hermann Weisse stressed the significance of the unwritten doctrines in their investigations.Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg: Platonis de ideis et numeris doctrina ex Aristotele illustrata, Leipzig 1826; Christian Hermann Weisse: De Platonis et Aristotelis in constituendis summis philosophiae principiis differentia, Leipzig 1828. Even Karl Friedrich Hermann, in an 1849 inquiry into Plato's literary motivations, turned against Schleiermacher's theses and proposed that Plato had only insinuated the deeper core of his philosophy in his writings and directly communicated it only orally.Karl-Friedrich Hermann: √úber Platos schriftstellerische Motive. = Before the T√ºbingen School: Harold Cherniss = * See also Harold Cherniss, American defender of Platonic unitarianism and critic of the unwritten doctrines Until the second half of the twentieth century, the 'antiesoteric' approach in Plato studies was clearly dominant. However, some researchers before the midpoint of the century did assert Plato had an oral teaching. These included John Burnet, Julius Stenzel, Alfred Edward Taylor, L√©on Robin, Paul Wilpert, and Heinrich Gomperz. Since 1959, the fully worked out interpretation of the T√ºbingen School has carried on an intense rivalry with the anti-esoteric approach.The rivalry began with Harold Cherniss, The Riddle of the Early Academy (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1945), and Gregory Vlastos, review of H. J. Kraemer, Arete bei Platon und Aristoteles, in Gnomon, v. 35, 1963, pp. 641-655. Reprinted with a further appendix in: Platonic Studies (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1981, 2nd ed.), pp. 379-403. Harold Cherniss, critic of the unwritten doctrines, in 1941-2. In the twentieth century, the most prolific defender of the anti- esoteric approach was Harold Cherniss. He expounded his views already in 1942, that is, before the investigations and publications of the T√ºbingen School.For a short summary of his views, see Harold Cherniss, The Riddle of the Early Academy (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1945). His main concern was to undermine the credibility of Aristotle's evidence for the unwritten doctrines, which he attributed to Aristotle's dismissive hostility towards Plato's theories as well as certain misunderstandings. Cherniss believed that Aristotle, in the course of his polemics, had falsified Plato's views and that Aristotle had even contradicted himself. Cherniss flatly denied that any oral teaching of Plato had extra content over and above the dialogues. Modern hypotheses about philosophical instruction in the Academy were, he said, groundless speculation. There was, moreover, a fundamental contradiction between the Theory of Forms found in the dialogues and Aristotle's reports. Cherniss insisted that Plato had consistently championed the Theory of Forms and that there was no plausible argument for the assumption that he modified it according to the supposed principles of the unwritten doctrines. The Seventh Letter was irrelevant since it was, Cherniss held, inauthentic.Cherniss published his views in Die √§ltere Akademie. = The anti-systematic interpretation of Plato's philosophy = In the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, a radicalization of Schleiermacher's dialogical approach arose. Numerous scholars urged an 'anti-systematic' interpretation of Plato that is also known as 'dialogue theory.'There is a collection of some papers indicative of this phase of Plato research in C. Griswold, Jr., 'Platonic Writings, Platonic Readings' (London: Routledge, 1988). This approach condemns every kind of 'dogmatic' Plato interpretation and especially the possibility of esoteric, unwritten doctrines. It is fundamentally opposed to the proposition that Plato possessed a definite, systematic teaching and asserted its truth. The proponents of this anti- systematic approach at least agree that the essence of Plato's way of doing philosophy is not the establishment of individual doctrines but rather shared, 'dialogical' reflection and in particular the testing of various methods of inquiry. This style of philosophy‚Äîas Schleiermacher already stressed ‚Äì is characterized by a process of investigation (rather than its results) that aims to stimulate further and deeper thoughts in his readers. It does not seek to fix the truth of final dogmas, but encourages a never-ending series of questions and answers. This far-reaching development of Schleiermacher's theory of the dialogue at last even turned against him: he was roundly criticized for wrongly seeking a systematic philosophy in the dialogues.For the influence of Schleiermacher's viewpoint see Gyburg Radke: Das L√§cheln des Parmenides, Berlin 2006, pp. 1‚Äì62. The advocates of this anti-systematic interpretation do not see a contradiction between Plato's criticism of writing and the notion that he communicated his entire philosophy to the public in writing. They believe his criticism was aimed only at the kind of writing that expresses dogmas and doctrines. Since the dialogues are not like this but instead present their material in the guise of fictional conversations, Plato's criticism does not apply.Franco Ferrari: Les doctrines non √©crites. = The origin and dissemination of the T√ºbingen paradigm = Thomas A. Szlez√°k, a prominent advocate of the T√ºbingen approach Until the 1950s, the question of whether one could in fact infer the existence of unwritten doctrines from the ancient sources stood at the center of the discussion. After the T√ºbingen School introduced its new paradigm, a vigorous controversy arose and debate shifted to the new question of whether the T√ºbingen Hypothesis was correct: that the unwritten doctrines could actually be reconstructed and contained the core of Plato's philosophy.For a comprehensive discussion, see Hans Joachim Kr√§mer and John R. Catan, Plato and the Foundations of Metaphysics: A Work on the Theory of the Principles and Unwritten Doctrines of Plato with a Collection of the Fundamental Documents (SUNY Press, 1990). The T√ºbingen paradigm was formulated and thoroughly defended for the first time by Hans Joachim Kr√§mer. He published the results of his research in a 1959 monograph that was a revised version of a 1957 dissertation written under the supervision of Wolfgang Schadewaldt.Hans Joachim Kr√§mer: Arete bei Platon und Aristoteles, Heidelberg 1959, pp. 380‚Äì486. In 1963, Konrad Gaiser, who was also a student of Schadewaldt, qualified as a professor with his comprehensive monograph on the unwritten doctrines.Konrad Gaiser: Platons ungeschriebene Lehre, Stuttgart 1963, 2. In the following decades both these scholars expanded on and defended the new paradigm in a series of publications while teaching at T√ºbingen University.Kr√§mer's most important works are listed in Jens Halfwassen: Monismus und Dualismus in Platons Prinzipienlehre. Further well-known proponents of the T√ºbingen paradigm include Thomas Alexander Szlez√°k, who also taught at T√ºbingen from 1990 to 2006 and worked especially on Plato's criticism of writing,Thomas Alexander Szlez√°k: Platon und die Schriftlichkeit der Philosophie, Berlin 1985, pp. 327‚Äì410; Thomas Alexander Szlez√°k: Zur √ºblichen Abneigung gegen die agrapha dogmata. the historian of philosophy Jens Halfwassen, who taught at Heidelberg and especially investigated the history of Plato's two principles from the fourth century BCE through Neo-Platonism, and Vittorio H√∂sle, who teaches at the University of Notre Dame (USA).Vittorio H√∂sle: Wahrheit und Geschichte, Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt 1984, pp. 374‚Äì392.

Since the important research of Giovanni Reale, an Italian historian of philosophy who extended the T√ºbingen paradigm in new directions, it is today also called the 'T√ºbingen and Milanese School.'Rafael Ferber: Warum hat Platon die \\"ungeschriebene Lehre\\" nicht geschrieben?, 2. In Italy, Maurizio MiglioriMaurizio Migliori: Dialettica e Verit√†, Milano 1990, pp. 69‚Äì90. and Giancarlo MoviaGiancarlo Movia: Apparenze, essere e verit√†, Milano 1991, pp. 43, 60 ff. have also spoken out for the authenticity of the unwritten doctrines. Recently, Patrizia Bonagura, a student of Reale, has strongly defended the T√ºbingen approach.Patrizia Bonagura: Exterioridad e interioridad. = Critics of the T√ºbingen School = Various, skeptical positions have found support, especially in Anglo-American scholarship but also among German-speaking scholars.Some of these positions are reviewed in Marie-Dominique Richard: L‚Äôenseignement oral de Platon, 2. These critics include: in the USA, Gregory Vlastos and Reginald E. Allen;Gregory Vlastos: Platonic Studies, 2. in Italy, Franco TrabattoniFranco Trabattoni: Scrivere nell‚Äôanima, Firenze 1994. and Francesco Fronterotta;Francesco Fronterotta: Une √©nigme platonicienne: La question des doctrines non-√©crites. in France, Luc Brisson;Luc Brisson: Premises, Consequences, and Legacy of an Esotericist Interpretation of Plato. and in Sweden, E. N. Tigerstedt.Eug√®ne Napol√©on Tigerstedt: Interpreting Plato, Stockholm 1977, pp. 63‚Äì91. German-speaking critics include: Theodor Ebert,Theodor Ebert: Meinung und Wissen in der Philosophie Platons, Berlin 1974, pp. 2‚Äì4. Ernst Heitsch,Ernst Heitsch: Œ§ŒôŒúŒôŒ©Œ§ŒïŒ°Œë. Fritz-Peter HagerFritz- Peter Hager: Zur philosophischen Problematik der sogenannten ungeschriebenen Lehre Platos. and G√ºnther Patzig.G√ºnther Patzig: Platons politische Ethik. The radical, skeptical position holds that Plato did not teach anything orally that was not already in the dialogues.For a discussion of 'extremist' views, see Hans Joachim Kr√§mer and John R. Catan, Plato and the Foundations of Metaphysics: A Work on the Theory of the Principles and Unwritten Doctrines of Plato with a Collection of the Fundamental Documents (SUNY Press, 1990). E. N. Tigerstedt, a historian of the fall of Neo-Platonism in the Early Modern Period, criticized the T√ºbingen interpretation. Moderate skeptics accept there were some kind of unwritten doctrines but criticize the T√ºbingen reconstruction as speculative, insufficiently grounded in evidence, and too far-reaching.This is, for example, the view of Michael Bordt; see Michael Bordt: Platon, Freiburg 1999, pp. 51‚Äì53. Many critics of the T√ºbingen School do not dispute the authenticity of the principles ascribed to Plato, but see them as a late notion of Plato's that was never worked out systematically and so was not integrated with the philosophy he developed beforehand. They maintain that the two principles theory was not the core of Plato's philosophy but rather a tentative concept discussed in the last phase of his philosophical activity. He introduced these concepts as a hypothesis but did not integrate them with the metaphysics that underlies the dialogues. Proponents of this moderate view include Dorothea Frede,Dorothea Frede: Platon: Philebos. √úbersetzung und Kommentar, G√∂ttingen 1997, S. 403‚Äì417. She especially disputes that Plato asserted the whole of reality could be derived from the two principles. Karl-Heinz Ilting,Karl-Heinz Ilting: Platons ‚ÄöUngeschriebene Lehren‚Äò: der Vortrag ‚Äö√ºber das Gute‚Äò. and Holger Thesleff.Holger Thesleff: Platonic Patterns, Las Vegas 2009, pp. 486‚Äì488. Similarly, Andreas Graeser judges the unwritten principles to be a 'contribution to a discussion with student interns'Andreas Graeser: Die Philosophie der Antike 2: Sophistik und Sokratik, Plato und Aristoteles, 2. and J√ºrgen Mittelstra√ü takes them to be 'a cautious question to which a hypothetical response is suggested.'J√ºrgen Mittelstra√ü: Ontologia more geometrico demonstrata. Rafael Ferber believes that Plato never committed the principles to a fixed, written form because, among other things, he did not regard them as knowledge but as mere opinion.Rafael Ferber: Warum hat Platon die \\"ungeschriebene Lehre\\" nicht geschrieben?, 2. Margherita Isnardi Parente does not dispute the possibility of unwritten doctrines but judges the tradition of reports about them to be unreliable and holds it impossible to unite the T√ºbingen reconstruction with the philosophy of the dialogues, in which the authentic views of Plato are to be found. The reports of Aristotle do not derive from Plato himself but rather from efforts aimed at systematizing his thought by members of the early Academy.Margherita Isnardi Parente: Il problema della \\"dottrina non scritta\\" di Platone. Franco Ferrari also denies that this systematization should be ascribed to Plato.Franco Ferrari: Les doctrines non √©crites. Wolfgang Kullmann accepts the authenticity of the two principles but sees a fundamental contradiction between them and the philosophy of the dialogues.Wolfgang Kullmann: Platons Schriftkritik. Wolfgang Wieland accepts the reconstruction of the unwritten dialogues but rates its philosophical relevance very low and thinks it cannot be the core of Plato's philosophy.Wolfgang Wieland: Platon und die Formen des Wissens, 2. Franz von Kutschera maintains that the existence of the unwritten doctrines cannot be seriously questioned but finds that the tradition of reports about them are of such low quality that any attempts at reconstruction must rely on the dialogues.Franz von Kutschera: Platons Philosophie, Band 3, Paderborn 2002, pp. 149‚Äì171, 202‚Äì206. Domenico Pesce affirms the existence of unwritten doctrines and that they concerned the Good but condemns the T√ºbingen reconstruction and in particular the claim that Plato's metaphysics was bipolar.Domenico Pesce: Il Platone di Tubinga, Brescia 1990, pp. 20, 46‚Äì49. There is a striking secondary aspect apparent in the sometimes sharp and vigorous controversies over the T√ºbingen School: the antagonists on both sides have tended to argue from within a presupposed worldview. Konrad Gaiser remarked about this aspect of the debate: 'In this controversy, and probably on both sides, certain modern conceptions of what philosophy should be play an unconscious role and for this reason there is little hope of a resolution.'Konrad Gaiser: Prinzipientheorie bei Platon.

The hedgerows show signs of a ditch and bank next to them, and this together with ancient trees suggests that the hedges and layout of the fields pre-date the late eighteenth-century Enclosure Acts. The landscape has changed little in the last 150 years. The fields are currently managed as neutral hay meadows. The northern field is damp and has plants typical of periodically waterlogged fields, such as creeping bent and marsh foxtail. Mammals on the site include woodmice, field voles and roe deer. The wildlife has increased considerably over the years, it is regularly visited by little white egrets, herons love the water and the waterlogged field for frogs and lizards.

The gate was originally built in the medieval period, and its outer portal was built in the Baroque style in 1724 by Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion. Despite this, the rear part of its gate retains its original form, making it one of the few visible remains of Mdina's medieval walls. History The Greeks Gate is one of two main gates of Mdina, the other being the Mdina Gate. It is located near the southwest corner of the city, and it got its name since a small Greek community once lived close to the gate. This gate was the only entrance into Mdina from which slaves were allowed to enter. Greeks Gate in 2010, before it was restored In the medieval period, the Greeks Gate was flanked by a D-shaped wall tower, which remained in use until the early 18th century, when Mdina's fortifications were upgraded under the military engineer and architect Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion. It is believed that the tower still exists buried behind Mondion's ramparts. At this point, Mondion also grafted a Baroque portal onto the Greeks Gate, giving it its present appearance. The inscription on the gate which commemorates this renovation is dated 1724. The Greeks Gate was restored between January and June 2003 by the Restoration Unit of the Ministry for Resources and Infrastructure. Restoration cost Lm15,000, and it included cleaning the gate, consolidating its decorative elements, and removal of vegetation on the roof. Plans for another restoration were made in 2014, when the government allocated ‚Ç¨1 million of ERDF funds for the restoration of Greeks Gate and the surrounding areas. Restoration of the gate commenced in late 2015 and was completed in early 2016. The Greeks Gate was included on the Antiquities List of 1925. Today, it is scheduled as a Grade 1 national monument, and it is also listed on the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. Architecture The gate viewed from the rear The Greeks Gate actually consists of two vaulted gateways grafted in front of each other. The inner gate still retains its original medieval features, including a pointed arch. A guardhouse was located inside the passageway between the gates. The outer gate consists of a Baroque portal, decorated with various coats of arms and a Latin inscription reading: The upper part of Greeks Gate contains a mural and oil paintings, one representing the Virgin and Child with Saint Anne and the Trinity, and the other showing the Baptism of Saint Publius by Paul the Apostle accompanied by Luke the Evangelist. Outer Greeks Gate The gate is approached through a pas-de-souris which is sometimes referred to as the Outer Greeks Gate. This was originally protected by a re-entrant place-of-arms, and was linked to the gate by a caponier. Today, the pas-de-souris provides vehicular access into the Mdina ditch, while the place-of-arms and caponier no longer exist. The gate was protected by a wooden √† la Vauban drawbridge and a drop ditch, but the latter has been filled in. The underground chamber in which the drawbridge was retracted still exists. The gate still retains its wooden door in situ.

It is a high quality replica of the out-of-print theatrical versions created by a team of Star Wars fans, with the intention of preserving the films, culturally and historically. The project was led by Petr Harm√°ƒçek, an English teacher from Plze≈à, Czech Republic under the online alias Harmy. The original Star Wars trilogy was created by George Lucas and released theatrically between 1977 and 1983. For the \\"Special Edition\\" theatrical re-release of the films in 1997, Lucas introduced noticeable changes to address his dissatisfaction with the original cuts. These included additional scenes and altered dialogue, and new sound-effects and computer-generated imagery. These changes were included in subsequent releases of the films for home viewing. the original theatrical releases are not commercially available, and have never been released in high definition. Some of the alterations were met with a negative response from both critics and fans. Harm√°ƒçek felt that altering the films in this way constituted \\"an act of cultural vandalism\\". In 2010, he began to create a high definition reconstruction of the films' theatrical versions. Harm√°ƒçek and a team of eight other fans used the 2011 Blu-ray releases for the majority of material, the lower-definition 1993 LaserDisc releases as a guide to the original version, and various other sources. The first version was published online in 2011, and updated versions have been released since. As a derivative work, Harmy's Despecialized Edition cannot be legally bought or sold in the United States and other countries with treaties respecting US copyrights, and is \\"to be shared among legal owners of the officially available releases only\\". Consequently, the films are only available via various file sharing methods. Reaction to the project has been positive, with critics generally praising the quality and aesthetics of the work. Background alt=The words \\"STAR WARS\\" written in a large, yellow, outline font against a black background The original Star Wars trilogy was a Lucasfilm production released theatrically by 20th Century Fox between 1977 and 1983, and was subsequently released on home media during the 1980s and 1990s. The films were distributed by CBS/Fox Video on several formats, such as VHS, Betamax, and LaserDisc. In 1997, to coincide with the 20th anniversary of Star Wars, Lucas re-released new cuts of the trilogy to theaters, naming them the \\"Special Editions\\". The purpose of this release was to alter the films to meet Lucas' ideal vision that he could not achieve during their original productions. A number of changes to the original releases included additions of enhanced digital effects, previously unreleased scenes, altered dialogue, unreleased and newly recorded music by John Williams, updated sound-effects by THX and Skywalker Sound, and entirely new CGI sequences from Industrial Light & Magic. Reaction to the \\"Special Edition\\" versions remain controversial with commentators praising the picture and sound restoration, but criticising unnecessary additions such as computer-generated characters, creatures, and vehicles as well as alterations to the essential story; most notably a short scene involving the bounty hunter Greedo shooting at Han Solo from the first film drew significant ire. Further changes to the series were added to the DVD release in 2004 to establish continuity with the prequel trilogy and to the Blu-ray releases from 2011. The final release of the theatrical cuts was in 2006, when unrestored masters used for the 1993 \\"Definitive Collection\\" trilogy on LaserDisc were added as a DVD bonus feature to a limited run ‚Äì fans named this release \\"George's Original Unaltered Trilogy\\" (GOUT). Despite a high demand and many online fan petitions, Lucasfilm has refused to release the theatrical versions of Star Wars in a high quality. In 2010, Lucas stated that bringing the original cuts to Blu-ray would be a \\"very, very expensive\\" process; , the films are still only widely available in their altered versions. Production=Conception= Petr Harm√°ƒçek (known online by the alias \\"Harmy\\") had watched a dubbed version of the original cut of Star Wars at the age of six, and had then seen the Special Editions of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi on their 1997 release. Although initially admiring them, he became disappointed when he learned how much the films had been changed retroactively; he argued that replacing the original effects with re-composited digital effects was \\"an act of cultural vandalism\\". A fan of the original trilogy, he had written his undergraduate thesis on their cultural impact. After seeing a trailer for Adywan's cut of The Empire Strikes Back, Harm√°ƒçek was inspired to create a version of the film that \\"undid\\" the post-1977 changes and restored the theatrical releases in high-definition. He described his motivation as: \\"I wanted to be able to show people who haven't seen Star Wars yet, like my little brother or my girlfriend, the original, Oscar-winning version, but I didn't want to have to show it to them in bad quality.\\" Harm√°ƒçek's edits were the first to recreate the theatrical releases in HD. =Editing= Harm√°ƒçek began creating his new cuts in 2010. At the time, he was working as an English teacher in Plze≈à and had no professional experience with film editing. Instead, he taught himself programs such as Avisynth and Adobe After Effects as the project progressed, beginning with Photoshop skills that he had developed in college. To remove the post-1977 changes, Harm√°ƒçek was required to go through the film frame-by-frame, correcting colors and rotoscoping. Undoing some shots took only an hour, while others took hundreds. Lightsabers were color-corrected, shots of the Millennium Falcon cockpit were un-cropped, Boba Fett's original voice was restored, and CGI characters and backgrounds were removed. =Sources= Most of the source material used for Harmy's Despecialized Edition was taken from Lucasfilm's official Blu-ray release of the films in 2011, while other sequences were upscaled from previous home video releases. These include: * The 2-disc \\"Limited Edition\\" DVD release from 2006. This set contains a low resolution copy of the theatrical cuts on a bonus disc. Harmy refers to this disc as \\"George's Original Unaltered Trilogy\\" (GOUT). * The official trilogy on DVD box set from 2004, primarily the HDTV broadcasts of those versions of the films. * The 1997 \\"Special Edition\\" re- releases, most notably digital broadcasts of those cuts along with their LaserDisc releases. * The 1993 LaserDisc \\"Definitive Collection\\" box set. * Digital transfers of a Spanish 35 mm Kodak LPP and 70 mm film cels, a 16 mm print. * A collection of still images of the original matte paintings. Harm√°ƒçek edited these sources together using programs such as Avisynth and Adobe After Effects. To help, Harm√°ƒçek was assisted by a group of like-minded fans from the website OriginalTrilogy.com. In total, the project took thousands of hours of work between them. In 2011, one year after the project had begun, the first version of Harmy's Despecialized Edition was published online; new and updated versions were created regularly in the five years that followed. , the most recent \\"despecialized\\" versions of Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi are v2.7, v2.0 and v2.5 respectively. As a result of the project, Harm√°ƒçek was able to quit his teaching job and in 2015 was hired by UltraFlix to prepare and restore a library of 4K-encoded films for sale and rent. He has since joined UPP, a Prague-based VFX house, as a 2D digital compositor and worked on such projects as Blade Runner 2049, Wonder Woman, and AMC's The Terror. =Legality= The legality of downloading Harmy's Despecialized Edition is contentious. As a fan edit, the cut cannot be legally bought or sold, and treads a line between fair use and copyright infringement. OriginalTrilogy.com states that the edits are \\"made for culturally historical and educational purposes\\" and that they are \\"to be shared among legal owners of the officially available releases only\\". Consequently, the films are only available via various BitTorrent trackers and through specialized rapid download programs using file sharing sites. Harm√°ƒçek himself remarked: \\"I'm convinced that 99% of people who download this already bought Star Wars 10 times over on DVD.\\" , he had received no legal challenge from either Lucasfilm, Disney, or 20th Century (all of whom are now sister companies) over the Despecialized Edition.  Alternate projects = Star Wars 4K77 = Star Wars 4K77 is a fan project where original 35mm prints were scanned and restored by Star Wars fans. In 2016, a few 35mm prints managed to be located and donated to group of fans called \\"Team Negative 1\\" (TN1), who took these prints and scanned them in 4K. After two years of painstaking restoration they were finally released to the public on May 18, 2018., first in the form of a 4K UHD file and then a 1080p downscale. According to the Project 4K77 website, 97% of the restoration came from a single print that contained a Spanish dub. The other 3% came from an alternate print and some frames were upscaled from the official blu-ray. Nothing required upscaling from any of the DVD or VHS releases. = Star Wars 4K80 = Star Wars 4K80 is second fan project where original 35mm prints were discovered of Empire Strikes Back that were scanned and currently being restored by Team Negative 1. Unfortunately, like 4K77, a lot of cleanup needed to be done after the 4K scans took place. According to the Project 4K80 website, it's still a work in progress, but is expected to take at least over a year to complete, despite only having 6 reels of film to clean up. = Star Wars 4K83 = Star Wars 4K83 is the third fan project where an original 35mm print of Return of the Jedi was discovered and scanned in 4K by Team Negative 1. According to the Project 4K80 website, unlike 4K77 and 4K80, the print that was utilized for this restoration required little cleanup. It was released to the public on October 18, 2018 in the form of 4K UHD files and downscaled versions in 1080p. Reception Reaction to Harmy's Despecialized Edition has been universally positive. Writing for Inverse, Sean Hutchinson placed it at number one on his list of the best Star Wars fan edits, and described it as \\"the perfect pre-1997 way to experience the saga\\". Whitson Gordon of Lifehacker called the edits \\"the best version of Star Wars you can watch\\", and named them \\"the version of Star Wars we've all been clamoring for the last 20 years\\". Similarly, Nathan Barry of Wired praised the films as \\"an absolute joy to watch\\", while Gizmodo described them as \\"very, very good\\". In an article listing Ars Technica's favorite Star Wars items, Sam Machkovech selected Harmy's Despecialized Edition, calling it \\"a treat\\".

Life Cowper was the third son of the Reverend John Cowper, MA of Overleigh Hall, Cheshire, by Catherine, daughter of William Sherwin, beadle of divinity and bailiff of the University of Oxford. He was baptised at St Peter's Church, Chester, on 29July 1701, was admitted a student at Leiden University on 27October 1719, and probably took his doctor's degree in that university. For many years he practised as a physician at Chester with great reputation. In 1745 he was elected mayor of Chester. He was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. He published anonymously A Summary of the Life of St. Werburgh, with an historical account of the images upon her shrine (now the episcopal throne) in the choir of Chester. Collected from antient chronicles and old writers, by a Citizen of Chester, Chester, 1749. This work is said to have been stolen from the manuscripts of Mr. Stone. He was also the author of Il Penseroso: an evening's contemplation in St. John's churchyard, Chester. A rhapsody, written more than twenty years ago, and now (first) published, illustrated with notes historical and explanatory, London, 1767, addressed, under the name of M. Meanwell, to the Rev. John Allen, M.A., senior fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and rector of Tarporley, Cheshire. In this work Cowper takes a view of some of the most remarkable places around Chester distinguished by memorable personages and events. He was an intelligent antiquarian and preserved many valuable manuscript collections of Williamson and others which would otherwise have perished. He also left several works of his own compilation relative to the ancient history of Cheshire and Chester. These manuscripts, which are frequently quoted by George Ormerod, the Cheshire historian, are preserved in the family archives at Overleigh. They consist of various small volumes, most of the contents of which are fairly transcribed into two larger ones, containing memoirs of the earls of the palatinate and the bishops and dignitaries of the cathedral, lists of city and county officers, and a local chronology of events. In his Broxton MSS he takes William Webbe's Itinerary as the text of each township, adds an account of it transcribed from Edward Williamson's Villare Cestriense, and continues the descent of property to his own time. He also wrote a small manuscript volume, entitled Parentalia, containing memoirs of the Cowper family, and the account of the siege of Chester, which is printed in Ormerod's Cheshire, vol. 1, pp. 203 etc. This description of the siege had been printed twice previously at Chester (in 1790 and 1793), but with considerable alterations. Cowper was a guardian of the Foundling Hospital in London. Overleigh Hall The Hall, to the west of what is now the modern district of Handbridge, was built by Thomas Cowper (d. 1695), who had acquired the estate partly through descent and partly through purchase. William Cowper made improvements to the property, which in 1811 was inherited by Charles Cholmondeley of Vale Royal Abbey and rented to a tenant. In 1821, along with of land, it was bought by Robert Grosvenor, 1st Marquess of Westminster and demolished in 1830 to allow construction of a new entrance to the Eaton Hall estate. Personal life and death Cowper married Elizabeth, daughter of John Lonsdale of High Ryley, Lancashire, in 1722, but had no issue. He died at Overleigh on 12October 1767, and was buried at St. Peter's Church, Chester.

She became well-known in 1895 when her family had her incarcerated in an asylum for planning to live with her lover, who was an Irish, working-class labourer. Lanchester later became secretary to Eleanor Marx. Early life Lanchester was born in Hove, Sussex on 28 July 1871, the fifth child of a family of eight. Her parents were Henry Jones Lanchester, an established architect, (1834‚Äì1914) and Octavia Ward (1834‚Äì1916). Following in their father's footsteps of bourgeois success, three of Edith's brothers became successful in the fields of architecture and engineering.  Work  After attending the Birkbeck Institution and the Maria Grey training college, Edith first worked as a teacher and then a clerk-secretary working for a firm in the City of London. By 1895 Edith was a confirmed socialist and member of the Social Democratic Federation (SDF). In 1897 Lanchester became secretary to Eleanor Marx, a feminist and socialist campaigner. Upon Marx's death, Lanchester received her writing pen as a memento. Politics and notoriety In 1895 Lanchester announced that she intended to live with her working-class lover and fellow Battersea SDF member, Shamus (aka James) Sullivan, beginning 26 October 1895. Lanchester's father was appalled and recruited Dr George Fielding Blandford, who, along with three of her brothers, interrogated Lanchester at her lodgings. Lanchester insisted that marriage was immoral and that she would lose her independence if she married, and was pronounced mad at the scene. Blandford justified his action by describing Lanchester's planned action as an act of \\"social suicide\\". When Lanchester physically tried to resist and fight back, she was handcuffed by her father. One of Lanchester's brothers reportedly assaulted Mrs Gray, Lanchester's landlady. Lanchester was taken by carriage to The Priory Hospital, Roehampton. The \\"Supposed Cause\\" of her insanity was recorded on the certificates as \\"over-education\\". Lanchester's case created a national scandal. John Burns, MP for Battersea, intervened, and The New York Times reported that the affair had \\"rivet[ed] the attention of three kingdoms\\" and that \\"no penny paper had printed less than ten columns on this engrossing subject during the week\\". The SDF attempted to release her and SDF supporters sang The Red Flag from outside the asylum's walls and beneath her barred window. The Marquess of Queensberry commended Lanchester's bravery and wrote to The Standard offering her a cheque for ¬£100 as a wedding present if she would go through the legal marriage ceremony \\"under protest\\" against marriage laws. During the four days of her incarceration Edith was subject to mental, physical and sexual abuse. Under Section 11 of the 1890 Lunacy Act, Edith could be detained for up to seven days but further incarceration would require another certificate. Edith was examined by the commissioners of lunacy, and found to be sane. She was released under Section 75 of the Lunacy Act, and set up home with Sullivan; she never saw her father alive again, though she did reconnect with her mother who left her ¬£400. Lanchester and Sullivan, however, lived together until his death in 1945. Eleanor Marx knew of Lanchester's situation in 1895 and had been disgusted by the misogynistic failure of male socialists to support and defend Edith's position, and more generally their failure to recognise the class dimension of the feminist struggle. Marx's ire was particularly directed towards SDF activist Ernest Bax who had publicly passed bourgeois moralistic judgement on Lanchester. Marx challenged Bax in a public letter to an open debate on \\"the woman question\\", but he declined, citing his rhetorical weaknesses. Although Edith was closest, in spirit, to the Fabians her own background influenced her choice to campaign and promote the cause of socialism through 'the true working-class'. By 1917 Edith identified politically as a communist describing socialists as 'practically Tories' who had let the working-class down. Personal life Lanchester's first child, Waldo Lanchester, was born in 1897. It was a difficult pregnancy that was not assisted by the social pressures that her 'love-child' pregnancy attracted. Marx invited Lanchester to recuperate for a few weeks at Marx's home (The Den) in Sydenham where Edith and Waldo were protected and looked after. During the early years of World War I, Biddy developed a growing interest in the pacifist principles of Quakerism. Her daughter, Elsa, recounts in her biography that Biddy and Shamus were \\"violently anti-war\\" and that pacifism 'roared through' the house. When Biddy's mother, Octavia, died in 1916, Biddy invested her ¬£400 inheritance in the Jordans Quaker community project. When Waldo was conscripted he registered as a conscientious objector and was imprisoned in Wormwood Scrubs for one year. Upon his release Waldo was supported by his mother to become a puppeteer and weaver. Her second child, Elsa Lanchester, became a noted actress with a long career in theatre, film, and television, and the wife of actor/director Charles Laughton. Lanchester continued to attend political meetings as long 'as she was physically active enough to walk to the bus.' Edith Lanchester died in April 1966 at Brighton.

Life and career Sheet music cover: \\"White Lilies Waltz\\" Fullerton was born in the city of Newburgh, New York. He was the only son of a prominent American trial lawyer, William Fullerton. His earliest surviving piece, \\"Silver Strains\\" was published in 1871, when he was 17.Library of Congress, Silver Strains, 1871.06780 Although not primarily a librettist, in the late 1870s, he provided romantic lyrics for two compositions by composer Rudolph Aronson,Library of Congress, Performing Arts Encyclopedia, \\"Bright Blue Eyes\\", Rudolph Aronson and William Fullerton, 1878; Library of Congress, Notated Music, \\"On the Silent Sea\\", Aronson, Rudolph and Aronson, Edward, 1878 who later founded and managed New York City's Casino Theatre. Fullerton left the United States to study music in Leipzig, and then settled in London, where he lived openly with another man, Percy Anderson, a talented painter with aristocratic connections. Anderson's sumptuous rooms became a gathering place for the musical and dramatic world.Coffin, pp. 25‚Äì26 In London, he wrote and published a variety of popular compositions, several of which were dedicated to members of the Royal Family and their circle. \\"May-be-so!\\", published in New York in 1880, was dedicated to the \\"Duchesse of Westminster\\". The ailing Lady Constance (who died the same year) was the wife of Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster. \\"In a Dream\\", published in 1881 (a song in the German \\"lieder\\" tradition, based on a poem by Heinrich Heine), was dedicated to Lady Agneta Montagu, a daughter of Charles Yorke, 4th Earl of Hardwicke and a bridesmaid to Alexandra of Denmark. An 1882 piece, \\"White Lilies Waltz,\\" was dedicated to Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, a favorite son of Queen Victoria who died from hemophilia in 1885. \\"Grand March Heroic: Tel-el-kebir\\", also published in 1882, celebrated a military victory over Egyptian nationalist forces, in the Battle of Tel el-Kebir, which secured British control over the Suez Canal. Fullerton had a theatrical success with an operetta, \\"Lady of the Locket\\", with a libretto by Henry Hamilton, a costly spectacle that opened in London's Empire Theatre in March 1885.G√§nzl, Kurt, British Musical Theatre, Vol. I, London, MacMillan & Co., 1986, pp. 253‚Äì256 The costumes for the production were designed and produced by his friend, Percy Anderson. The production launched Anderson's career as a leading costume designer for decades to come, as well as the career of their friend, the baritone Hayden Coffin.Coffin, p. 34 Musical conductor Jimmy Glover later claimed, probably in jest, that Hamilton and Fullerton had insisted that certain choral parts be sung by \\"real guardsmen\\", and that he had rehearsed 16 soldiers for weeks, only to have them called away to serve in Egypt.\\"Jimmy Glover, His Book\\", Methuen & Co., London, 1912 Critics gave the light music negative reviews, but the piece was popular, and the run lasted from early March until late July, when the heat decreased theatre attendance. Following this success, another light opera, \\"Waldemar: Robber of the Rhine\\" was ready for production, but Fullerton fell ill and died from what was described as \\"consumption\\", on August 25, 1888. A memorial in The Times mourned the loss of \\"our Billy\\", a remarkable tribute to a young American.\\"In Memoriam\\", The Times, September 2, 1888 He was closely attended in his final illness by Percy Anderson, who arranged for Fullerton's burial in Crondall Burying Ground, All Saints Church, Hampshire, United Kingdom.

Incumbent Republican Governor Kay Orr ran for reelection to a second term in office, but was narrowly defeated by Democratic challenger Ben Nelson. Orr's popularity had suffered due to changes in the state's income-tax structure enacted in 1987, which were seen as a violation of her pledge not to increase taxes. The impending construction of a low-level radioactive-waste repository in north central Nebraska also occasioned discontent with her administration. In the Republican primary, she easily defeated \\"perennial candidate\\" Mort Sullivan, but her winning margin was significantly smaller than expected. Seven Democrats, four of them regarded as serious contenders, vied for their party's gubernatorial nomination. School funding, abortion, and the question of whether to establish a state lottery were among the issues at play in the campaign. So close was the primary election that it took 48 days to declare Nelson the winner, by a margin of 41 votes. The contest between Orr and Nelson was generally seen as an unusually negative one. Orr accused Nelson of questionable business dealings; Nelson accused Orr of violating the public trust. Each accused the other of negative campaigning. Salient issues included the 1987 tax changes; the radioactive-waste site; and a bill shifting a large portion of school funding from local property taxes to the state general fund, which included increases in the sales and income taxes, and which had passed over Orr's veto. When the election was held, Nelson defeated Orr by a margin of 4030 votes, with 49.91% of the vote to her 49.23%. It was suggested that a winter storm on the day of the election might have contributed to Orr's defeat, by reducing turnout among elderly and rural voters. Background In 1986, Republican Kay Orr, who had been Nebraska's state treasurer for five years, defeated Democrat Helen Boosalis for the governorship. During the campaign, Orr pledged not to increase taxes. In 1987, at Orr's urging, the state legislature passed LB773, which changed Nebraska's method of calculating its personal income tax. Up to that time, the state's income tax had been a percentage of the taxpayer's federal liability. Under the new system, Nebraska would base its tax on federal adjusted gross income, with the state establishing its own system of exemptions and deductions. Proponents argued that such a measure was necessary to produce stability and give Nebraska greater control over its state revenues; opponents objected to the fact that the measure would increase taxes on lower- and middle-income taxpayers, while decreasing them for upper-income Nebraskans. The plan as proposed by Orr would have been revenue-neutral, neither increasing nor decreasing state revenue. The final version, however, as passed by the legislature and signed by Orr, increased receipts by an estimated $11‚Äì14 million. The increase in revenues was seen as a breach of Orr's pledge concerning taxes, and her popularity fell as the new system went into effect. In December 1987, a poll indicated that 60% of Nebraskans approved of her performance and 25% disapproved; by March 1988, her approval rating had dropped to 48%, while those disapproving had increased to 38%. In December 1989, the numbers stood at 47% approval and 46% disapproval. Boyd County, in north central Nebraska Orr's popularity was further damaged by the proposed siting of a low-level nuclear waste disposal facility in the state. In 1983, during the tenure of governor Bob Kerrey, Nebraska had joined Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma to form the Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, under which a single disposal site would be constructed for all five states. In 1987, the members of the compact voted 4‚Äì1 to place the facility in Nebraska. At that time, Orr declared that she was not pleased with the choice, but had to acquiesce in the other states' decision. U.S. Ecology, the company chosen to construct and operate the facility, considered a variety of sites in the state. In January 1989, they announced that they had narrowed their choices to sites in Boyd, Nemaha, and Nuckolls counties; in January 1990, they declared that they had chosen the Boyd County location. Democratic primary=Candidates= Seven candidates ran in the Democratic primary. Four of them were regarded as serious contenders for the nomination. *Mike Boyle, former mayor of Omaha, Nebraska's largest city. Boyle had been elected mayor in 1981 and re-elected in 1985, but in 1987 had lost a recall election brought about by a petition drive. *Bill Harris, mayor of Lincoln, Nebraska's capital and second-largest city. Harris had represented a Lincoln district in the state legislature from 1982 until his election as mayor in 1987. *Bill Hoppner, a former staffer for elected officials J. James Exon and Bob Kerrey. Hoppner had served on Exon's staff from 1973 to 1982, initially as legal counsel while Exon was governor, then as chief of staff when Exon was elected to the U.S. Senate. He had then returned to Nebraska and served as chief of staff for governor Kerrey from 1982 to 1984; in 1989, when Kerrey took a seat in the U.S. Senate, Hoppner had again served for a year as his chief of staff. *Ben Nelson, an attorney and insurance executive. Nelson was making his first bid for elective office. In 1986, he had been the state chairman of Boosalis's unsuccessful gubernatorial campaign. In 1975-76, he had served as director of the Nebraska Department of Insurance. The other three candidates in the Democratic primary were regarded as unlikely to win; when the election was held, the three combined drew less than 3% of the vote. *Don Eret, a farmer from Dorchester, who had served in the state legislature from 1982 to 1986. *Robb Nimic, a philosopher and theologian from Lincoln, who had filed as a pauper. *Robert Prokop, a forensic pathologist from Wilber, who had held a seat on the University of Nebraska Board of Regents from 1971 to 1982. =Issues=Taxes and school funding One of the foremost issues in the Democratic primary concerned school funding. In April 1990, the legislature passed LB1059, which made major changes to the financing of public education in the state. Prior to its passage, roughly 70% of the money for primary and secondary schools came from property taxes and other local sources. The expressed goal of the bill's supporters was to increase the state's contribution to school districts from 25% of operational costs to 45%; this would be funded through a 25% increase in the sales tax and a 17.5% increase in the personal income tax. Proponents maintained that the measure would lessen inequality among school districts and would avert a significant increase in property taxes; they also noted that courts in several other states had struck down locally-financed educational systems such as Nebraska's. Opponents argued that the increased taxes would prove burdensome to Nebraskans, particularly the poor, and expressed doubt that the measure would prevent substantial property-tax increases. The bill passed; Orr vetoed it, but was overridden. Of the four leading Democratic candidates, Boyle, Harris, and Nelson declared that they would have vetoed the bill, arguing that it would not in fact lead to long-term property-tax relief. Hoppner expressed enthusiastic support for the measure, \\"because it's at the heart of the traditional Democratic message of this state, because the people of this state care about our children\\". Other issues Another issue raised in the Democratic primary was the question of whether a state lottery should be established in Nebraska; and, if established, what use should be made of the revenues generated thereby. Of the four major candidates, Harris indicated that he was generally opposed to a lottery. Boyle proposed that proceeds be used for property-tax relief; Hoppner declared that they should be used for special one-time expenses, and not for routine spending; and Nelson maintained that they should be used to augment basic spending on education. Harris and Hoppner both declared themselves supporters of abortion rights, and were endorsed by the pro-choice organization Nebraska Voters for Choice. Boyle expressed opposition to abortion, and received the endorsement of pro-life organizations Metro Omaha Right to Life and the Nebraska Coalition for Life. Nelson also declared himself an opponent of abortion, but said that if the legislature passed abortion-rights legislation, he would neither veto nor sign it, allowing it to become law without his signature. All four of the major Democratic candidates asserted that illegal drug use was one of the critical issues in the campaign; Harris stated that it was the number-one issue facing Nebraska and the nation. All four were opposed to drug abuse and crime. Nelson and junk bonds In the final two weeks before the primary election, Nelson came under attack from Harris and Hoppner for his involvement with life-insurance holding company First Executive, for which he had acted as a consultant and director; he and his law firm had collected over $1.8 million in fees from the company. First Executive had large holdings in junk bonds, which had recently received a great deal of unfavorable attention related to investment banking firm Drexel Burnham Lambert's February 1990 declaration of bankruptcy, and to Drexel employee Michael Milken's April 1990 conviction for securities fraud. Nelson maintained that he had played no part in the junk- bond investment decisions of First Executive, having only joined the company's board in 1988. =Strategy and spending= Nelson led the field in campaign contributions and spending; by the end of April, his campaign had spent $593,000. In the same time period, Hoppner had spent $326,000; Harris, $156,000; and Boyle, less than $60,000. Nelson was criticized for accepting large contributions from insurance companies in Chicago and California; he had also loaned his campaign over $360,000, a sum far greater than that borrowed by any of the other candidates. The number of viable candidates complicated the devising of campaign strategies. Under more ordinary circumstances, a candidate could win a statewide Nebraska Democratic primary by winning heavily in five eastern counties, containing just over half of the state's registered Democrats: Douglas and Sarpy counties, which include the Omaha metro area; Lancaster County, including Lincoln; and Dodge and Saunders counties. In this election, however, every Democratic vote had to be sought, which made it necessary to direct campaign efforts to the Third Congressional District, consisting of the western three-quarters of the state. Although the Third District was one of the most Republican congressional districts in the nation, its small population of Democrats might prove crucial in the final vote count. Nebraska congressional districts in 1990; Third District in yellow The four candidates had four different strategies. Boyle's was based on securing a strong lead in Omaha, from voters who had supported him as mayor, and on doing well among conservative Democrats in the Third District, attracted by his pro- life stance and endorsements. Harris expected to win heavily in Lancaster County, and to draw votes from more socially-liberal Democrats throughout the state because of his pro-choice position; he had secured the endorsement of Democratic former governor Frank Morrison, who campaigned with him throughout Nebraska. Hoppner depended on the support of activist and party-line Democrats, drawn by his pro-choice stance, his support for LB1059, and his association with Exon and Kerrey; four days before the election, he received a formal endorsement from Kerrey, and began broadcasting a television commercial in which the senator declared his support for Hoppner. Nelson's strategy was the most focused on the Third District: his campaign's goal was to minimize his losing margin in Omaha and Lincoln, while winning heavily in rural Nebraska. His advantage in funding proved important in this. While Hoppner relied on television advertising on stations in Omaha, Lincoln, Grand Island, Hastings, Kearney, and North Platte, Nelson bought advertising in all of those markets and also on Sioux City, Iowa television, which reached northeastern Nebraska, and on radio station KRVN in Lexington, Nebraska, with a large listenership in rural central and western Nebraska. To reach more voters who were outside of the areas covered by the eastern and central television stations, he staged a direct-mail campaign, sending up to three letters to registered Democrats in rural areas near the state's northern, southern, and western borders. =Newspaper endorsements= There was no consensus among the daily newspapers of the state regarding the Democratic candidates. The state's largest newspaper, the Omaha World-Herald, which then circulated throughout Nebraska, endorsed Harris, noting in particular his opposition to gambling. The Grand Island Independent also endorsed Harris alone. The Lincoln Journal found Harris, Hoppner, and Nelson all worthy candidates. The Lincoln Star and the Fremont Tribune endorsed Hoppner; the Kearney Hub, Boyle; and the North Platte Telegraph, both Boyle and Hoppner. =Results= Polls conducted days before the May 15 election showed no clear winner in the Democratic primary: any of the four major candidates might have won. Further polling showed no clear outcome in hypothetical matchups between any of the four and Orr. Of the 363,778 registered Democrats in the state, 172,812, or 47.5%, voted in the primary; 166,744 of them cast ballots in the gubernatorial race. As the ballots were counted, Harris quickly fell behind the other three major candidates; in Lancaster County, on which he had counted heavily, he ran in third place, behind Hoppner and Nelson. Harris attributed his poor showing to the fact that he and Hoppner had split the pro-choice vote, and to Kerrey's late endorsement of Hoppner. Boyle led Hoppner in Douglas County by 11,000 votes, and until about midnight he held the lead; however, his support outside of the Omaha area was not strong, and he was forced to admit defeat soon thereafter. On the morning of May 16, Hoppner and Nelson were virtually tied, with only a few hundred votes between them, absentee ballots still to be counted, and a recount almost certain to be held, as required by state law for cases when two leading candidates were within one percentage point of one another. The recount in fact proved necessary; and so close was the contest that only on July 3, some 48 days after the election, was Nelson certified the winner, by a margin of 41 votes: 44,556 to Hoppner's 44,515. Candidate with plurality in each county in the Democratic primary =Lieutenant governor= Under the state constitution as it existed in 1990, parties chose their nominees for governor and lieutenant governor in separate votes in the primary; the two nominees from each party then ran as a ticket in the general election. In the Democratic lieutenant-gubernatorial race, five candidates ran; the winner was Maxine Moul, a resident of Syracuse, who with her husband had owned Maverick Media, which published five newspapers and several shoppers. Moul received 29.9% of the vote cast; her closest competitor was Steve Wiitala of Omaha, formerly the Douglas County Election Commissioner and before that a member of the state legislature, who garnered 26.8% of the vote. Republican primary=Candidates= Orr faced only nominal opposition in the Republican primary, which drew little media attention. Only two names appeared on the Republican ballot. *Kay Orr, one-term incumbent governor. *Mort Sullivan, described by the Omaha World-Herald as a \\"perennial candidate\\". Sullivan owned an Omaha company that operated automatic telephone- dialing machines; in 1989, he had run in the Omaha mayoral election, placing sixth. =Results= In the Republican primary, Orr had been expected to win easily, and did. However, Sullivan received about 31% of the vote, unpleasantly surprising Orr, who had expected him to win from 15% to 25%. Orr attributed this to Republican dissatisfaction with some of her decisions as governor, including the tax changes of 1987. Sullivan's unexpectedly high percentage was also attributed in part to Orr's failure to oppose the proposed radioactive-waste repository: he defeated her in Boyd County, chosen for the site; in Nuckolls County, which had been one of the three finalists considered by U.S. Ecology; and in Webster County, which borders Nuckolls County and which had been among the locations initially considered for the disposal site. Percentage of vote received by Orr in Republican primary, by county =Lieutenant governor= Orr's incumbent lieutenant governor, Bill Nichol, did not run for re-election. Jack Maddux, a cattleman from Wauneta, ran against Omahan Roy Brettman. Maddux, backed by much of the state's Republican establishment, won with 67.2% of the vote to Brettman's 32.5%; 0.3% of the vote went to write-in candidates. General election The campaign leading up to the general election was regarded as an unusually negative one; an Omaha World-Herald editorial described it as a \\"long, cruel, issue-less campaign\\". Nelson's campaign manager accused Orr's campaign of \\"negative cheap shots\\"; Orr's campaign manager accused Nelson of \\"stridently negative attacks\\". Nelson's campaign declared that Orr had \\"no credibility because she has violated the public trust\\"; Orr's accused Nelson of \\"vicious attacks\\". In an October debate, Nelson accused Orr of \\"constant attacks on my character, constant attacks on my family relations\\", while Orr accused Nelson of \\"the worst type of negative campaigning this state has ever seen\\". =Issues=Junk bonds redux In July, Nelson announced that he would not seek re- election to First Executive's board when his term expired at the end of the month, stating that his campaign would not leave him time to fulfill his duties as a director, and that his resignation had nothing to do with the company's history of junk-bond dealings. In September, Orr's campaign ran a commercial stating that Nelson, as a consultant and director of the company, must have been involved in its decisions to invest in junk bonds. In an October radio interview, she said \\"My opponent owns a company with Mike Milken\\"; she subsequently issued a partial retraction, calling Nelson \\"a business associate with Mike Milken\\". Nelson declared that Orr had \\"resorted to negative campaigning in order to save her job\\", and denied any relationship with Milken. Orr called for Nelson to make his income-tax return public, providing her own to the Omaha World-Herald in a sealed envelope, to be opened if Nelson's were also made available. Nelson declined to do so, for reasons of \\"privacy and security\\", declaring that he had provided all the records required by the law, and accusing Orr of demanding them as a diversionary tactic. Taxes and spending Nelson pressed the issue of taxes, maintaining that the 1987 restructuring had increased taxes on lower- and middle-class taxpayers, while decreasing them for the wealthy. Orr responded by citing a Deloitte and Touche study finding that taxes on most low and middle incomes were lower in 1989 than they had been in 1986; state senator Don Wesely, a Nelson consultant, denounced the study as \\"political propaganda to mislead the public\\". Nelson accused Orr of profligate spending, noting that the state budget had increased by 40% during the first three years of her governorship. Orr's campaign responded that the steep increase was partly due to essential spending deferred during the nationwide recession of the early 1980s and the farm recession of the mid-80s; partly due to the state takeover of the welfare system, which had previously received some of its funding from the counties; and partly due to a 65% increase in Medicaid costs. A petition drive was launched to repeal school-finance bill LB1059. Orr ran radio commercials in support of the repeal, calling the bill \\"a record tax increase\\" and noting that she had vetoed it. Nelson declined to sign the petition, stating that the bill, though flawed, should be corrected by the legislature rather than repealed altogether. Orr's campaign condemned this, declaring that Nelson was \\"trying to get votes from people on both sides by riding the fence\\". Boyd County In July 1990, Kerrey withdrew his support from the proposed radioactive-waste repository in Boyd County, asserting that the facility might no longer be needed and might not be economically feasible. Nelson joined Kerrey in calling for a moratorium on further work. Orr declared that she would be willing to suspend the process, if Kerrey could guarantee that Nebraska taxpayers and power consumers would not suffer, but expressed concern that such a move might be a violation of federal law; an Orr staffer cited a study indicating that costs of withdrawing from the waste-disposal compact would be at least $150 million, and might be as high as $425 million. Nelson declared that \\"[i]f I am elected governor, it is not likely that there will be a nuclear dump in Boyd County or in Nebraska\\". He called for a debate in Boyd County, and accused Orr of a \\"lack of leadership\\" on the matter; in mid-October, he held a rally in the county at which he chided his opponent for her unwillingness to campaign there, and declared that more forceful opposition by Orr would have prevented the decision to locate the site in Nebraska. Following the rally, the Boyd County Republican Committee announced its unanimous endorsement of Nelson over Orr. Other issues Orr accused Nelson of \\"lacking leadership\\" on abortion, declaring that she would veto any bill that relaxed restrictions on the procedure. The Nebraska Coalition for Life endorsed Orr, with the comment that \\"[Nelson's] position is no position at all\\". The candidates differed on a measure on the ballot, promoted by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, that would legalize video slot machines. Nelson supported the measure, and stated that if elected, he would propose an amendment to the Nebraska constitution that would authorize a statewide lottery. Orr opposed the video-slot measure, and any attempt to establish a state lottery. Orr claimed credit for the state's 2% unemployment rate. She emphasized her party affiliation, declaring \\"This is a Republican state.\\" She asserted that Nebraskans knew her and her record as a public official, while Nelson was an unknown quantity. =Campaigns and spending= Orr spent twice as much as Nelson, in what the Omaha World-Herald described as \\"the most expensive governor's race in state history\\". President George H. W. Bush visited Omaha to raise funds for her and for two Republican Congressional candidates. She secured an endorsement from University of Nebraska athletic director Bob Devaney, revered in Nebraska for his success as the coach of the university football team. Twelve of Nebraska's daily newspapers, including the World-Herald and the Lincoln Star, endorsed Orr. Nelson garnered two endorsements, from the McCook Daily Gazette and the Fremont Tribune (the latter of which endorsed Orr as well). The Lincoln Journal declined to endorse either candidate, accusing both of negative and mean-spirited campaigning. Two weeks before the election, the Orr campaign discovered that Dresner Sykes, their media-consulting firm, had charged the campaign for television advertising time that was never purchased. A World-Herald analysis after the election determined that Creative Media, the firm's advertising placement agency, had charged the campaign $34,860 for October advertising on Omaha station KMTV, while actually purchasing $6,115 worth of time, or 17.5% of that ordered. A similar pattern obtained on other stations in Omaha, Lincoln, North Platte, and Sioux City, with Creative Media actually purchasing between 12% and 88% of the time ordered by the campaign. Although the campaign had ordered advertisements placed on Omaha television stations every day during the period October 5‚Äì22, nothing ran on at least four days of the period. Dresner Sykes reimbursed the Orr campaign with a $50,000 check and with the cancellation of unpaid bills; but Orr could not recover the lost advertising time in the past, and found that the most desirable advertising times for the rest of the campaign's duration were already taken. =General election results= On November 6, the day of the election, a winter storm struck central Nebraska, depositing up to of snow and ice. Secretary of State Allen Beerman estimated that up to 50,000 voters might have been kept from the polls by the weather. The storm reduced turnout in the Third District and among elderly voters, who historically tended to support Republicans. Before ballot-counting was complete, Beerman suggested that the weather might have cost Orr the election. Unofficial results on election night gave Nelson a lead of 4,658 votes out of nearly 570,000. As absentee ballots were counted, it became clear that they would not change the outcome; Orr conceded to Nelson on November 9. The official results gave Nelson 292,771 votes (49.91%) to Orr's 288,741 (49.23%). Sullivan, running as a write-in, garnered 1887 votes (0.32%); other write-ins received 3143 votes (0.54%). Nelson won 19 counties that the Republicans had won in the 1986 gubernatorial election, many of them in areas that had been suggested as locations for the radioactive-waste disposal site. Percentage of vote received by Nelson in general election, by county Other votes Nebraska voted on four seats in the U.S. Congress: one in the Senate and three in the House of Representatives. All three incumbents running were re-elected. Exon, a Democrat, won re-election to the Senate, securing 59% of the vote to defeat Republican Hal Daub. Republican Doug Bereuter was re-elected to the First District House seat, with 65% of the vote to Democrat Larry Hall's 35%. In the Second District, one-term incumbent Peter Hoagland, a Democrat, received 58% of the vote to Republican Ally Milder's 42%. In a race for an open House seat in the Third District, Republican Bill Barrett defeated Democrat Sandra K. Scofield, taking 51.1% of the vote to her 48.8%. The LB1059 repeal effort, which Orr had supported and Nelson opposed, failed: 44% of the votes cast supported repeal, while 56% favored keeping the measure. A World- Herald article noted that opposition to repeal was especially high in areas where rural school districts were receiving large amount of state aid, and that support for repeal was strongest in Douglas County. The ballot measure to legalize and regulate video lotteries, which Nelson had supported and Orr opposed, also failed. Votes in favor of the measure amounted to only 35% of the total, while 65% were opposed. Nationally, the Democratic Party made small gains in the U.S. Congress, with an increase of one seat in the Senate and eight in the House of Representatives. Incumbent governors fared poorly: the incumbent party lost in 14 of the 36 contests, including two in which independent candidates won. Governors who had reneged on pledges not to allow tax increases suffered badly; beside Orr, Republicans Mike Hayden of Kansas and Bob Martinez of Florida were rejected by the voters.

Because of his function in the Episcopal Conference, DƒÖbrowski participated in political events of communist Poland. In December 1981 he wrote a letter to General Wojciech Jaruzelski in which he condemned the proclamation of the martial law in Poland and the subsequent repressions by the regime. Biography DƒÖbrowski was born in Grodziec, now Poland, in 1917. At the age of 29 he took his first vows in the Orionine Fathers congregation and on 10 June 1945 became a Catholic priest. He conducted charitable work on behalf of war-injured children, helping to establish an orphanage home in Izbica Kujawska. In 1950 DƒÖbrowski became director of the Office of the Episcopate of Poland and a year later led the Secretariat of the Primate of Poland.

The work premiered on January 8, 1930, at Maxine Elliott's Theatre in New York City. The performance was part of a concert staged by the Dance Repertory Theatre, a group that included dancer/choreographers Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Helen Tamiris. Their stated goal was \\"to give annually a season of continuous dance programs which will be representative of the art of dance in America and will give native artists an outlet for their creative work.\\" Other new Graham works on the evening's program were Lamentation and Prelude to a Dance.  Synopsis  Harlequinade was divided into two sections, Pessimist and Optimist. The biting portrait of the Pessimist and subtle portrayal of the Optimist were intended as symbols of all the tragedy and comedy in the world. The accompanying orchestra consisted of flute, clarinet, bass clarinet, trumpet, drums and voice. As with much of her early work, little is known about the choreography. Barbara Morgan's photographs of Graham dancing in the Harlequinade costumes are virtually all that is known about the piece. The two outfits were also described in The Christian Science Monitor's 1938 review of a Boston performance. \\"Here the artist's own costuming - horizontal stripes for the former, billowing black taffeta, with a large red property handkerchief, for the latter, are punctuation marks.\\"  Critical reception  The New York Herald Tribune noted the work displayed \\"the Graham art at its scintillating best, both penetrating and disarming.\\" The New York Times called it \\"extremely polished and penetrating.\\" Not all critics found her a credible comedian. In 1932, The New York Sun reported the work was \\"invalidated by its obvious humor...Miss Graham seems incapable of stylizing this aspect of herself intruding a note of ineffectiveness into the general excellence of what she does.\\" From later reviews, it appears the dance did not hold up well compared to subsequent choreographic efforts. The February 1936 issue of the Dance Observer contained a critique that noted, \\"Miss Graham casts a shadow on her earlier powers,\\" adding that her later dances possessed \\"greater depth and subtlety.\\"  References  External links  * Dance Repertory Theatre program (Week Beginning Monday Evening, January 6, 1930) Category:Ballets by Martha Graham Category:1930 ballet premieres ","title":"Harlequinade (1930 Graham ballet)"},{"id":"49208509","text":"Luigi \\"Gigi\\" Angelillo (December 20, 1939 ‚Äì July 21, 2015) was an Italian actor and voice actor.

Article 28 of Bangladesh constitution states that \\"Women shall have equal rights with men in all spheres of the State and of public life\\".  History  Feminist movements in Bangladesh started long before its independence. During the 19th century the social reform movement, mostly carried out by male social leaders, worked to abolish practices such as infanticide, child marriage, and widow burning. Women activists in Bangladesh organized to claim their rights during the British and Pakistan period of Bangladesh. They mobilized to fight regarding issues including violence against women, economic opportunities for women, equal representation in politics for women, reproductive rights, reforming family law, and gender equality in public policies. During the Pakistan period the feminist movement was more focused on politics and national struggles. The feminist movement of the 1970s and 1980s was led by professional women from urban areas. Issues=Muslim Family Law= The Muslim Family Law, created by the British Indian Government and later amended by Pakistani president Ayub Khan, is based on Shariah Law, which is discriminatory against women in Bangladesh.

It focuses on readability and maintainability. Readability is achieved by syntactic and conceptual minimalism. The language is heavily inspired by Smalltalk and Self but has some very distinctive features. Like Smalltalk, Citrine treats everything as an object and focuses on sending messages to these objects. However unlike Smalltalk, Citrine lacks the concept of a class. In this regard, Citrine is more like Self and JavaScript because it uses prototypes. The combination of Smalltalk like messages and prototypes is what makes Citrine unique. As of the 0.7 version Citrine has focused on supporting native human languages instead of just English to help people reduce the number of bugs because of confusion and misunderstanding due to language barriers. As such Citrine 0.7 and higher feature a translator to translate between human languages. Syntax Citrine has a very limited syntax and it's very closely related to Smalltalk. Everything in Citrine is an object, there are 5 literals:  \`{ ...params.. ...block of code... }\` The code block literal uses a pipe symbol to separate the parameters from the logic '', if there are no parameters, the backslash should be used instead of '\\\\'. Citrine only supports full-line comments, comments start with a '#'. A Citrine program is basically a sequence of messages sent to objects. For instance, to determine whether 5 is an even number, the message 'even?' is sent to the number 5. 5 even? This is called a unary message because it takes no arguments. A binary message is always a single UTF-8 character; this differs from Smalltalk, where there is a fixed set of binary messages. Here is an example: 6 + 7. Here a binary message '+' is sent to number 6, the argument of this binary message is '7', this will result in a new number object '13'. Assigning the outcome of this operation to a variable uses the assignment operator: :=. total := money + debt. Also note that each line in a Citrine program ends with a dot, just like in Smalltalk. Besides unary and binary messages, Citrine offers keyword messages, which take arguments interspersed with the message itself just like Smalltalk and Objective-C. ‚òû x := Number between: 1 and: 5. The code snippet above will return a boolean object True. Control flow Just like Smalltalk, control flow in Citrine is implemented by strategic use of messages. For instance, writing a conditional statement requires sending a block of code to a boolean. (money > price) true: { ‚úé write: 'Yes, you can afford this'. }. Likewise, a for-loop is written as: { :step ‚úé write: 'this is step:' + step. } * 10. To break out of a loop in Citrine one has to send the message 'break' to a boolean, this allows a conditional break from a loop without having to factor out the break conditions: { :i (i = 3) break. ‚úé write: i. } * 5. Pipelines Unlike Smalltalk, Citrine has no semi-colon to send a message to the original receiver. Instead Citrine has a comma token ',' used to chain keyword messages, this allows writing Unix-like pipelines. The following code uses a pipeline-like syntax to replace all the 'o' characters with zeroes, the resulting string would be something like: '1010101...'. onesAndZeroes := '1o1o1o1o1o1' split: 'o', map: mapUp, join: '0'. Prototypes The biggest difference from Smalltalk is the use of prototypes. Citrine does not have a concept of a class, it only knows about objects. An object is created using the new message: cat := Object new. This object can be made to respond to messages by ordering the object to listen to events. This is kind of similar to adding methods in languages like Java: cat on: 'meow' do: { Pen write: 'meow!'. }. As stated above, inheritance is based on prototypes. To derive an object from another object, the new message must be sent to the object to be extended: ‚òû Animal := Object new. Animal on: 'makeSound' do: { ‚úé write: '?'. }. ‚òû Cat := Animal new. Cat on: 'makeSound' do: { ‚úé write: 'meow!'. }. ‚òû Tom := Cat new. Tom makeSound. Unicode Citrine uses UTF-8 unicode extensively, both objects and messages can consist of unicode symbols. All string length are calculated using UTF-8. Citrine distinguishes string length and size in bytes: 'text' length. returns the length of the string in UTF-8 code pointes, while: 'text' bytes. returns the number of bytes. Scoping Citrine uses dynamic scoping instead of lexical scoping. Thus, there is no need for dependency injection or global variables, but it might be harder to reason about than lexical scope. This is similar in programming languages like Emacs Lisp and BASIC. In code blocks the var keyword needs to be used to declare a local variable. The following demonstration makes the Mailer object available in the module: Application := { ‚òû mailer := Mailer new. module run. }.

He was able to gather there a lot of original information regarding the Treculia. For more than 30 years he studied and selected, together with the Flemish Sister Paula Trio, the best varieties of the Treculia in Pendjua in the north of Bandundu Province, Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 1974 Father Jaqcues Bijttebier, (under the guidance of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and UNESCO), mapped the dissemination area of the Treculia in Africa. =Kisangani - Belgium, 1974-1993= During the period from 1974 to 1993 Father Jaqcues Bijttebier worked closely with; * Prof. L.O.J.

In the 1980s Prof. Hugo Gevaerts was teaching at the Faculty of Science in Kisangani, where he met Prof. Jean DeClerck. He told Prof. Jean DeClerck about agro-breeding programs and the remaining work to do. While their contact was growing, they met Father Jaqcues Bijttebier, who talked about a tree that could be a solution to malnutrition. In 1992, Father Jacques Bijttebier published a paper in which he describes the properties and nutritional value of this plant.Bijttebier,R.P.J. (1981).

Father Jacques Bijttebier died, at the age of 66, on May 27, 1993 in Leuven (Belgium). =Kisangani - Belgium, 1993-1998= After Father Jaqcues Bijttebier died, Sister Paula Trio remained in contact with the coordinator Jean DeClerck. They learned that Sister Paula Trio would definitely leave Pendjua. Prof. Jean DeClerck requested that Treculia-seeds from the best varieties (still in pulp), be brought over with her on her last return trip from Belgium. (N.B the germination of the Treculia seeds is extremely short). Sister Paula Trio then brought +-400 seeds with her, which Prof. Jean DeClerck immediately divided amongst the involved Universities and also the Botanical National Garden of Meise (Belgium). These seeds were germinated fast and after six weeks became trees of +-15 cm. Prof. Jean Lejoly (Ulb) wanted to save 100 of them to undertake research participated in with Zairian, (Congolese), scientists, L. Ndjele & JP Mate. Prof. Hugo Gevaerts brought the 300 young trees he had left on his travel to Kisangani in 1995, where they immediately and carefully were planted at the University. Appreciation for this plant as a fruit tree really started thanks to Project Rotary International \\"Project Agro-forestry 3-H\\", an initiative of Professors Jean DeClerck (formerly a visiting professor at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Kisangani), Jean LeJoly, (Professor at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, Laboratoire de Botanique), and Hugo Gevaerts, (former dean of the Facult√© des Sciences, UNIKIS and professor at the Limburg University Centre). These three professors have, together with their colleagues from the University of Kisangani, (Leopold Ndjele, Valentin Kamabu and Jean-Pierre Mate), been inspired by the important results of the work of Father Bijtebier to encourage that this tree be adopted by the population of Kisangani. This project, Agro-forestry 3-H, ran from 1995 to 1998. In this period several plantations were laid out and there were thousands of plants distributed to the population. Various wars of recent years have prevented the normal development of this project.http://www.kisangani.be/Een-boom-vol- toekomst-voor Fortunately, in 1998 the \\"Project LUC\\", (Limburg University Centre), led by Professor Hugo Gevaerts was created. This project devoted much attention to the popularization of this \\"miracle plant\\" under the Agro- forestry project.http://www.congoforum.be/ndl/interviewsdetail.asp?id=24791&interviews;=selected =Lubumbashi - Kinshasa, 2004= In 2004, the Foundation Maisha planted, in cooperation with researchers from the Universities of Kisangani and Leuven K.U.L (Belgium), the Treculia Africana tree in Lubumbashi to nourish the street children. Later also, the Universit√© de Kinshasa planted trees on their University Campus. History From 2000 to 2003 the horticulturist Jean Kiala was taught by Romain Wiels, an agronomist and former colonial of the Congo. This wise man told in his practice lessons about his experiences in the Congo; and about the possible potential of these plants in the food and pharmaceutical industry. In the winter of 2012, nine years after his last classes with agronomist Romain Wiels, Jean Kiala came back in contact with his old teacher. While talking about his project, agronomist Romain Wiels told him about his old friend Prof. Jean DeClerck and the Treculia trees. =Sint- Pieters-Leeuw 2012= In the spring of 2012 the horticulturist Jean Kiala came in contact with the Flemish bakery consultant Guido Lasat, who was a close friend of Father Bijtebier who had worked with him in the '70s to early '90s. This man talked about the potential in the bakery industry and advocating starting a plantation. In 2012 the Belgian CICM Missionaries and the Flemish bakery consultant Guido Lasat entrusted to managing director Jean Kiala an old agro-forestry project of the late Father Jacques Bijttebier in the rainforest of the D.R. of the Congo. The idea being to create a network of agricultural cooperatives so that farmers can get a fair price for their crop. Guido Lasat died in March 2013. =Lisala - Kisangani 2012= In 2012, Jean Kiala did his research on the Treculia and selected the best varieties from Africa. On the advice of the Belgian Fathers, he collected many distinct plant cuttings and seeds, and placed them on tissue culture in five laboratories in Africa and Europe. Later destroyed the test fields in the forest, just to be sure no Western company would monopolize the project. He managed to collect 15 cultivars coming directly from Father Bijttebier‚Äôs testing fields. By the end of the year, the Nutrecul Agro-forestry Project was created. Nutrecul is a contraction of Nutrition Treculia or Nutritive Trees Cultivation. =Kisangani, 2014= Because director Jean Kiala received death threats from the Western Seed & Nutrition lobby.https://m.facebook.com/NutreculAgroforestry/posts/767930636598457 As of May 5, 2014, the project merged with the AWDF to ensure the development of the innovative tropical forest conservation project Nutrecul.http://africanwildlifedefenceforce.com/Nutrecul_Agroforestry2.html ReferencesExternal links *Official Website on https://web.archive.org/web/20141218060847/http://nutrecul-agroforestry.com/ *Official Linkedin page on http://www.linkedin.com/company/nutrecul- agroforestry *Official Facebook page on http://www.facebook.com/NutreculAgroforestry ","title":"Nutrecul Agroforestry Project"},{"id":"49208675","text":"Eric Dupont is a French producer for Incognito films, best known for producing short-film Ave Maria that earned him Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film nomination at the 88th Academy Awards.

Many criticisms have been leveled at C++'s design by well-known software developers including Linus Torvalds, Richard Stallman, Joshua Bloch, Rob Pike, Ken Thompson,https://gigamonkeys.wordpress.com/2009/10/16/coders-c-plus-plus/ and Donald Knuth.http://www.drdobbs.com/architecture-and-design/an-interview-with- donald-knuth/228700500http://tex.loria.fr/litte/knuth-interview C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language with extensive, but not complete, backward compatibility with C. This article focuses not on C features like pointer arithmetic, operator precedence or preprocessor macros, but on pure C++ features that are often criticized. Slow compile times The natural interface between source files in C/C++ are header files. Each time a header file is modified, all source files that include the header file should recompile their code. Header files are slow because they are textual and context-dependent as a consequence of the preprocessor. C only has limited amounts of information in header files, the most important being struct declarations and function prototypes. C++ stores its classes in header files and they not only expose their public variables and public functions (like C with its structs and function prototypes) but also their private functions. This forces unnecessary recompiles of all source files that include the header file, each time when changing these private functions. This problem is magnified where the classes are written as templates, forcing all of their code into the slow header files, which is the case with the whole C++ standard library. Large C++ projects can therefore be relatively slow to compile. The problem is largely solved by precompiled headers in modern compilers. One suggested solution is to use a module system. A module library is planned to be released in C++20, with future C++ releases planning to expose the functionality of the standard library using modules. Global format state of  C++ \`\` unlike C \`\` relies on a global format state. This fits very poorly together with exceptions, when a function must interrupt the control flow, after an error, but before resetting the global format state. One fix for this is to use Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) which is implemented in Boost but is not a part of the C++ Standard Library. The global state of uses static constructors which causes overhead. Another source of bad performance is the use of \`std::endl\` instead of \` \` when doing output, because of it calling flush as a side effect. C++ \`\` is by default synchronized with \`\` which can cause performance problems. Shutting it off can improve performance but forces giving up thread safety. Here follows an example where an exception interrupts the function before \`std::cout\` can be restored from hexadecimal to decimal. The error number in the catch statement will be written out in hexadecimal which probably isn't what one wants: #include #include int main() { try { std::cout << std::hex; std::cout << 0xFFFFFFFF << ' '; std::vector vector(0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFL, 0); // Exception std::cout << std::dec; // Never reached } catch (std::exception &e;) { std::cout << \\"Error number: \\" << 10 << ' '; // Not in decimal } } It is acknowledged even by some members of the C++ standards body that the iostreams interface is an aging interface that needs to be replaced eventually. This design forces the library implementers to adopt solutions that impact performance greatly. Iterators The philosophy of the Standard Template Library (STL) embedded in the C++ Standard Library is to use generic algorithms in the form of templates using iterators. Early compilers optimized small objects such as iterators poorly, which Alexander Stepanov characterized as the \\"abstraction penalty\\", although modern compilers optimize away such small abstractions well. The interface using pairs of iterators to denote ranges of elements has also been criticized. The C++20 standard library's introduction of ranges should solve this problem. One big problem is that iterators often deal with heap allocated data in the C++ containers and become invalid if the data is independently moved by the containers. Functions that change the size of the container often invalidate all iterators pointing to it, creating dangerous cases of undefined behavior. Here is an example where the iterators in the for loop get invalidated because of the std::string container changing its size on the heap: #include #include int main() { std::string text = \\"One Two Three Four \\"; // Let's add an '!' where we find newlines for (auto it = text.begin(); it != text.end(); ++it) { if (*it  ' ') { // it = text.insert(it, '!') + 1; // Without updating the iterator this program has // undefined behavior and will likely crash } } std::cout << text; } Uniform initialization syntax The C++11 uniform initialization syntax and std::initializer_list share the same syntax which are triggered differently depending on the internal workings of the classes. If there is a std::initializer_list constructor then this is called. Otherwise the normal constructors are called with the uniform initialization syntax. This can be confusing for beginners and experts alike #include #include int main() { int integer1{10}; // int int integer2(10); // int std::vector vector1{10, 0}; // std::initializer_list std::vector vector2(10, 0); // size_t,int std::cout << \\"Will print 10 \\" << integer1 << ' '; std::cout << \\"Will print 10 \\" << integer2 << ' '; std::cout << \\"Will print 10,0, \\"; for (const auto& item : vector1) { std::cout << item << ','; } std::cout << \\" Will print 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0, \\"; for (const auto& item : vector2) { std::cout << item << ','; } } Exceptions There have been concerns that the zero-overhead principle isn't compatible with exceptions. Most modern implementations have a zero performance overhead when exceptions are enabled but not used, but do have an overhead during exception handling and in binary size due to the need to unroll tables. Many compilers support disabling exceptions from the language to save the binary overhead. Exceptions have also been criticized for being unsafe for state-handling. This safety issue has led to the invention of the RAII idiom, which has proven useful beyond making C++ exceptions safe. Encoding of string literals in source-code C++ string literals, like those of C, do not consider the character encoding of the text within them: they are merely a sequence of bytes, and the C++ \`string\` class follows the same principle. Although source code can (since C++11) request an encoding for a literal, the compiler does not attempt to validate that the chosen encoding of the source literal is \\"correct\\" for the bytes being put into it, and the runtime does not enforce character encoding. Programmers who are used to other languages such as Java, Python or C# which try to enforce character encodings often consider this to be a defect of the language. The example program below illustrates the phenomenon. #include #include int main() { // all strings are declared with the UTF-8 prefix std::string auto_enc = u8\\"V√•r g√•rd p√• √ñland!\\"; // file encoding determines // the encoding of √• and √ñ std::string ascii = u8\\"Var gard pa Oland!\\"; // this text is well-formed in // both ISO-8859-1 and UTF-8 std::string iso8859_1 = u8\\"V\\\\xE5r g\\\\xE5rd p\\\\xE5 \\\\xD6land!\\"; // explicitly use the ISO-8859-1 // byte-values for √• and √ñ - this is // invalid UTF-8 std::string utf8 = u8\\"V\\\\xC3\\\\xA5r g\\\\xC3\\\\xA5rd p\\\\xC3\\\\xA5 \\\\xC3\\\\x96land!\\"; // explicitly use the // UTF-8 byte // sequences for √• // and √ñ - this will // display // incorrectly in // ISO-8859-1 std::cout << \\"byte- count of automatically-chosen, [\\" << auto_enc << \\"] = \\" << auto_enc.length() << ' '; std::cout << \\"byte-count of ASCII-only [\\" << ascii << \\"] = \\" << ascii.length() << ' '; std::cout << \\"byte-count of explicit ISO-8859-1 bytes [\\" << iso8859_1 << \\"] = \\" << iso8859_1.length() << ' '; std::cout << \\"byte- count of explicit UTF-8 bytes [\\" << utf8 << \\"] = \\" << utf8.length() << ' '; } Despite the presence of the C++11 'u8' prefix, meaning \\"Unicode UTF-8 string literal\\", the output of this program actually depends on the source file's text encoding (or the compiler's settings - most compilers can be told to convert source files to a specific encoding before compiling them). When the source file is encoded using UTF-8, and the output is run on a terminal that's configured to treat its input as UTF-8, the following output is obtained: byte-count of automatically-chosen, [V√•r g√•rd p√• √ñland!] = 22 byte-count of ASCII-only [Var gard pa Oland!] = 18 byte-count of explicit ISO-8859-1 bytes [Vr grd p land!] = 18 byte-count of explicit UTF-8 bytes [V√•r g√•rd p√• √ñland!] = 22 The output terminal has stripped the invalid UTF-8 bytes from display in the ISO-8859 example string. Passing the program's output through a Hex_dump utility will reveal that they are still present in the program output, and it is the terminal application that removed them. However, when the same source file is instead saved in ISO-8859-1 and re-compiled, the output of the program on the same terminal becomes: byte-count of automatically-chosen, [Vr grd p land!] = 18 byte-count of ASCII-only [Var gard pa Oland!] = 18 byte-count of explicit ISO-8859-1 bytes [Vr grd p land!] = 18 byte-count of explicit UTF-8 bytes [V√•r g√•rd p√• √ñland!] = 22 Code bloat Some older implementations of C++ have been accused of generating code bloat.

Part of the Lambton Kent District School Board, it is one of Sarnia's educational institutions. It has approximately 550 full-time students (2015‚Äì2016) and is home to the Blue Bombers. In November 2015 the school was proposed to the board for closure in 2017.  Facility  SCITS was the only secondary school in Lambton County to enjoy the use of an 850-seat auditorium. The auditorium was home to the SCITS drama classes and B.E.S.T. Productions. The dedication to the Drama program was evident in the 14 different performances by the SCITS students. The SCITS Revue was a tradition that went back as far as the school building itself in 1922. The annual variety show featured singing, dancing, comedy, etc., and was open to all students in the school. In 2013, Canadian Astronaut Chris Hadfield, gave a motivational talk on his time aboard the International Space Station in a sold out SCITS Auditorium. SCITS was home to one of the only heated indoor pools in the county. A swimming component was inherent in the physical education curriculum at SCITS. The school library housed several hundred books, a computer assisted study area, as well as a rare collection of aboriginal artifacts and art work.  History  As the oldest secondary school in the city, Sarnia Collegiate Institute & Technical School (SCITS) was steeped in history. SCITS was part of Sarnia's 100th anniversary as a city in 2014. The first edition of the annual SCITS yearbook, \\"The Collegiate,\\" was published at Christmas in 1914, and a yearbook was published annually until the school was closed in 2016. 1914 was the same year that Sarnia incorporated as a city. Sarnia Collegiate traced its roots back to the 1800s as a small grammar school, then as a school on Lochiel Street, later as a school on London Road, and finally in 1922 as Sarnia Collegiate Institute & Technical School on Wellington Street. The school operated as \\"SCITS\\" until July, 2016, when low student population led to consolidation of SCITS with St. Clair Secondary School (SCSS),http://www.theobserver.ca/2016/05/10/scits-st-clair- secondary-slated-for-consolidation-this-fall forming the Great Lakes Secondary School. The Great Lakes Secondary School held classes in the SCITS building for the school year 2017‚Äì2018, while renovations and updates were made at the SCSS building on Murphy Road.http://www.lkdsb.net/school/glss/Lists/Announcements/Attachments/71/Q%20and%20A%20GLSS%202018-01-08.pdf In 1920 the Sarnia Board of Education made the decision to form a new high school to replace the one on London Road, following which debentures were offered. With the Adolescent Act coming into effect in September 1922, making it compulsory for boys and girls up to 16 & 18 years of age to attend school, it became even more imperative to provide more classrooms as soon as possible. In 1921 S. B. Coon and Son, Architects from Toronto submitted the plans for the new building. Tenders were called in February 1921. The general contractor was P. H. Secord and Sons Construction Company of Brantford. There were about 40 sub-contractors among whom were Sarnia firms including Sarnia Bridge Company, roof trusses; F. Chambers and Company, electricians; Flisinger, plumbing and steamfitting; Mueller Brass, and a great number of others. Headlines in the December 31, 1921, issue of the Sarnia Canadian Observer read ‚ÄúNEW COLLEGIATE IS THE BEST EQUIPPED IN THE PROVINCE‚Äù. Heating was thermostatically controlled, air was constantly exchanged, and it had an independent fire alarm system, automatic clocks controlled from the principal's office, a medical room, the 25-foot by 75-foot‚Äô swimming pool with showers and dressing room, and a number of other specialty rooms. On August 5, 1921, a cornerstone was laid by Dr. F. W. Merchant of the Ontario Department of Education. Included in that cornerstone was a copper box containing a 1921 city directory which listed the area, population and many other facts about Sarnia, sample bottles of oil from Imperial Oil Ltd., and a manuscript by Chief Jacobs written in Ojibwa with an English translation, all the current copper and silver coins, a list of the civic officials, and a history of the schools dating back to 1838. Included as well was a list of the present board of education members. Present at that ceremony were the mayor, city council members, board of education members, and many members of Sarnia's clergy, including Dr. John Hall and Rev. Canon Davis. Also present were a great many of Sarnia's prominent citizens.http://thesarniajournal.ca/almost-a-century- later-scits-time-capsule-to-be- opened/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/windsor/sarnia-high-school-uncovers- history-embedded-in-cornerstone-1.4643661 In September 1922, classes commenced at the new school, although its official opening wasn't until October of that year. The ceremonies on October 28, 1922, were attended by the students, officials, teachers and the general public, filling the auditorium. The newspaper headlines on that day read ‚ÄúGREATEST EVENT IN THE HISTORY OF SARNIA WITH THE OPENING OF COLLEGIATE-TECHNICAL SCHOOL‚Äù. For over thirty years, this was the only public high school in Sarnia. When it was built, it was one of the very few high schools in Ontario that was free to its students.  Controversy  In November 2015, Lambton Kent District School Board staff presented a report to the board in regards to the consolidation of St. Clair Secondary School, and Sarnia Collegiate institute & Technical School. This report called for the consolidation of both schools at the now St. Clair Secondary School sites, and closing SCITS. There was public outcry regarding this proposal and a group has formed to oppose the closure, including an organized \\"Save SCITS\\" group. The group emphasized the community importance and heritage conservation value of keeping the nearly-century old building. On May 10, 2016, despite vocal public admonition to consolidate the two schools at the historic 1922 Sarnia Collegiate site at 275 Wellington Street, Lambton Kent District School Board trustees voted to consolidate the two schools at the 1961 St. Clair Secondary School site at 240 Murphy Road. The Lambton Kent District School Board officially declared the historic building surplus in August 2019, and is listed for sale.

After his death in 1850, his wife Anne Margret was determined to keep the business running, forming a partnership initially with son Harry Bickford in 1864, \\"Bickford and Son\\".Scales, Marjorie An Alchemist's Dream pub. Ronald F. Bickford 1990 In 1871, William Jr joined to form \\"A. M. Bickford & Sons\\". Looking to branch out into other markets, in 1872 they built the South Australian Cordial Factory, a bottler and aerated water factory. Production of cordials and soft drinks commenced in 1874, among the first of which was their now iconic lime juice cordial.Bickford's labels also still continue to carry the statement: \\"On account of spurious imitations none is genuine unless bearing the signature of A M Bickford & Sons\\".

Formation Rachel Simons, then known as Ray Alexander, played a significant part in setting up the organisation, and was helped by Johnny Gomas, the General Secretary of the Cape Town Stevedoring Workers Union. It was launched at a meeting on 26 March 1936 where Willy Driver was elected Secretary. By July 1936 it had 1300 members. Its first conference, attended by 26 delegates, was held in Cape Town on 3 and 4 August 1936. It decided to affiliate to the International Trade Union Committee of Negro Workers and the South African Trades and Labour Council. As Africans could not rent premises in towns it operated from the premises of the Cape Town Stevedoring Workers Union at 57 Plein Street, which was rented in the name of White members of the South African Communist Party. The Union submitted grievances to the management of the South African Railways and Harbours Administration, but were not allowed to negotiate. In 1937 Ray Alexander produced a pamphlet for the union called \\"We Want to Live\\". It pointed out that the Cape Town City Council paid its labourers 6/8d a day but railway workers were only paid 3/6d or 4/-d a day. In Bloemfontein there was a general minimum wage of 3/6d a day but this did not apply to railway workers, who were paid less. The average wage of the 28,000 casual labourers was less than ¬£32 a year - less than the average wage of black workers in 1920. Many black staff had no definite hours of work, but were required to be available as required. African workers only got 3 days paid holiday a year (Good Friday, Christmas Day and Union Day). The union joined the Council of Non-European Trade Unions when it was established in November 1941. Sarah Carneson was general secretary in 1945.Shaun de Waal, \\"Sarah Carneson: A lifetime dedicated to SA's freedom struggle\\" Mail & Guardian (15 November 2015). Organisation General Secretaries of the Union: * John Noako * Johnny Mtini * Greenwood Ngotyana * Archibald 'Archie' Mncedisi Sibeko From 1942 to the 1950s the union had an advantage because of labour shortages and succeeded in negotiating improvements. Mtini employed Archie Sibeko as the union's first full-time organiser, working out of a corner of the Non European Laundry Workers Union office in Cape Town in or around 1953. The union's operations at that time were almost completely clandestine. Sibeko wore the uniform brown overalls so that he would be inconspicuous on railway property. Until he was banned Ben Turok worked closely with him and took up cases using his position as a member of the Cape Provincial Council. If a strike was organised large numbers of workers were arrested and taken to court. The union organised for each one to give evidence individually about why they stopped work, and this usually led to prosecutions being withdrawn. Those who were known to be active in the union were routinely transferred to remote areas with reduced wages. Union organisers found on railway property were prosecuted for trespass. After an unsuccessful strike in Port Elizabeth in 1957, defeated by the use of prison labour, the railways strikers all dismissed. The stevedores were retained but their wages were reduced. Lawrence Ndzanga was the union's organiser in Johannesburg, working with his wife Rita who worked for the union as a typist. He was elected National President of the union in September 1962. Moses Mabhida was also a full-time organiser, paid ¬£25 a month. It was a founder member of the South African Congress of Trade Unions in 1955. Suppression A number of the union's organisers, including Sibeko, were arrested on at 4 am 5 December 1956 among those charged in the 1956 Treason Trial, which continued until 1961. The union organised a strike at the end of May 1961 against the establishment of the Republic of South Africa. In December 1961 the office was infiltrated by an informer. It was raided by the police who took all the membership cards. The General Law Amendment Act of 1962, generally known as the Sabotage Act made organisation very difficult. In December 1962 the South African Congress of Trade Unions was listed in a government proclamation under which 432 people were banned from holding office in any of 36 listed organisations, including 45 officials of SACTU and its affiliates. The General Law Amendment Act, 1963 made life even more difficult. All the officials were detained or banned. Sibeko and Mabhida left the country. There was no open trade union activity for the remainder of the decade. Sam Pholotho became President of the union in 1965, but he too was banned. Revival The union was revived in December 1985, operating from Lusaka. It affiliated to the Congress of South African Trade Unions, whose offices it shared, and the United Democratic Front. It held its first national conference at Grahamstown in October 1986, with Sam Pholotho in the chair. Sello Ntai was elected as General Secretary and Justice Langa as president. There were then about 10,000 members. Its first task was to persuade people to leave the company union, the Black Trade Union of Transnet Workers in order to join SARAHWU. The first campaigns were about the quality of food supplied in the workers compounds. A successful boycott campaign encouraged about 3/4 of the railways workers in the Southern Transvaal to join by the end of 1986. A strike started at the container depot in City Deep, Gauteng on 16 March 1987 over the sacking of a delivery driver. By the first week of April more than 20,000 were on strike. The strike was supported by other unions, but not by the Black Trade Union of Transnet Workers, and spread across the whole country. On 22 April 3 workers were shot dead and many injured in an incident which became known as the Germiston massacre. There were many violent incidents, including the burning of trains at Orlando Power Station and the murder of strike breakers. The government retaliated by attacking both the union and the Congress of South African Trade Unions. Most of the union leadership were arrested. On 7 May there were two explosions at COSATU House which destroyed all the unions membership files and equipment. A settlement was agreed on 5 June which could be presented as a union victory, although the union was still not recognised. By 1988 membership had grown to around 43,000. There was still no checkoff system. The union refused to apply for registration because that would imply acceptance of a \\"blacks only\\" union. There were 18 offices across the country with about 55 employees, and there was often not enough money to pay them. In October 1988 annual congress Martin Sebakwane was elected General Secretary. In November 1989 there was a further strike as a result of which, in January 1990, Transnet (newly formed) agreed to recognise the union and to derecognise the Black Trade Union of Transnet Workers. Several people were killed - again at Germiston - and over 5000 employees sacked. The rail lines at the port of Durban were sabotaged. The union agreed to be registered and the recognition agreement was signed on 1 November 1990. The third annual congress was held from 27 February to 2 March 1991. For the first time the Coloured and Indian unions in Transnet were invited guests. From October 1991 the union could participate in the new Transnet Industrial Council. In September there were proposals for a strike. Transnet made an offer which was accepted by Sebakwane on 29 September 1991 without consulting the unions full negotiating team. The Southern Transvaal shop stewards objected and they occupied the unions office and later kidnapped Sebakwane. Sibeko, who had been elected Honorary President, was brought in to run the head office for several months. COSATU conducted a Commission of Enquiry which reported in January 1992. They found no evidence of corruption, as had been alleged, but considerable evidence of abuse and misuse of union funds and facilities. After this Derrick Simoko was elected General Secretary. Sebakwane stepped down and became a trainee manager for Transnet. The liberation of freedom fighters and the Government of National Unity was a challenge for the union. Its organisers were political activists rather than administrators. A number of organisers were accused of irregularities and forced to resign. Salaries were not always paid on time even as late as 1997. Furthermore, the new government were not prepared to continue to subsidise the transport industry and the numbers employed declined significantly. By 1998 membership had fallen to 35,000. A merger was eventually negotiated with the Black Trade Union of Transnet Workers and the smaller Transnet Allied Trade Union. The merged organisation was called the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union and was launched at a special congress on 16 December 1998. A further merger with the Transport and General Workers Union was negotiated in 1999.

Development  Around 1984, Honda engineers began experimenting with different engine and chassis layouts to test viability for future products. One of the test mules was a Honda City that had been cut in half, with the engine installed behind the driver's seat and powering the rear wheels. Although the project was not developed any further, many of the engineers were inspired by the exciting laps around the company parking lot in the mid-engined City. This experience, in part, convinced Honda leadership that the company should consider developing a pure sports car. As a result, in 1984, Honda commissioned the Italian car styling house Pininfarina to design the concept car HP-X (Honda Pininfarina eXperimental), which had a C20A 2.0 L V6 engine in a mid-mounted configuration. After Honda committed to a sports car project, the company management informed the engineers working on the project that the new car would have to be as fast as anything coming from Italy and Germany. The HP-X concept car evolved into a prototype known as NS-X, which stood for \\"New\\", \\"Sportscar\\" \\"eXperimental\\". The prototype and eventual production model‚Äîwhich was marketed as the NSX‚Äî were designed by a team led by Honda Chief Designer, Masahito Nakano, and Executive Chief Engineer, Shigeru Uehara (who were subsequently placed in charge of the S2000 project). The original performance target for Honda's new sports car was the Ferrari 328 (and later, the 348) as the design neared completion. Honda intended its sports car to meet or exceed the performance of the Ferrari, while offering superior reliability and a lower price. For this reason, the 2.0 L V6 engine utilised in the HP-X was shelved and ultimately replaced with a significantly more powerful 3.0 L VTEC V6 engine. Over the course of development of the NSX, many engines were used, ranging from the 2.7-litre single overhead camshaft V6 engine from the Honda Legend/Honda Coup√© to the 3.0-litre single overhead camshaft V6 engine, used subsequently in 15 test mules.Long, Brian; Acura NSX Honda's Supercar p23 Honda eventually settled on a non-VTEC, 3.0-liter double overhead camshaft 24-valve V6 engine selected for the production model. This engine generated a maximum power output of about and of torque, with a redline of 7,300 rpm. However, at the same time, Honda was working on its revolutionary VTEC variable valve timing system, with plans to release it on the company's home-market 4-cylinder Integra.Dinkel, John; Road & Track magazine, September 1989, \\"Acura NSX: Birth of an Exotic\\" p47-48 Honda's then-president Tadashi Kume, himself a highly-skilled and respected engine designer, questioned the NS-X designers' logic in foregoing the VTEC system for Honda's new flagship sports car, while it was being used on the lower-market Integra. As a result, the engine was redesigned very late in the development process \\"to achieve the desired levels of performance and durability\\"; Honda designed a new cylinder block with 6-bolt main caps and larger cylinder heads to contain the complex VTEC mechanism. Innovative connecting rods made from a titanium alloy were used to lower reciprocating weight, while increasing overall rod-strength‚Äîsomething which increased the engine's maximum rpm by 700, resulting in a final redline of 8,000 rpm. A consequence of this last-minute engine change was that the new C30A engine was too large to fit in the NS-X's engine bay, which had been carefully sized for the smaller heads of the non-VTEC DOHC 3.0 liter engine. As a result, the engineers were forced to tilt the entire engine backward approximately 5 degrees- a characteristic that continued all the way to the NSX's final production in 2005. The exterior design had been specifically researched by Uehara after studying the 360-degree visibility inside an F-16 fighter jet's cockpit. Thematically, the F-16 came into play in the exterior design as well as establishing the conceptual goals of the NSX. In the F-16 and other high performance aircraft such as unlimited hydroplanes along with open-wheel race cars, the cockpit is located far forward and in front of the power plant. This \\"cab-forward\\" layout was chosen to optimize visibility while the long tail design enhanced high speed directional stability.pg.12, NSX Technical Information and Development History-Honda Motor Corp The NSX was designed to showcase several automotive technologies, many derived from Honda's F1 motor- sports program. The NSX was the first production car to feature an all- aluminium semi-monocoque, incorporating a revolutionary extruded aluminium alloy frame and suspension components. The use of aluminium saved nearly of weight over the use of steel in the body alone, while the aluminium suspension arms saved an additional ; a suspension compliance pivot helped maintain wheel alignment changes at a near zero value throughout the suspension cycle. Other notable features included an independent, 4-channel anti-lock brake system; an electric power steering system; Honda's proprietary VTEC variable valve timing system and in 1995, the first electronic throttle control fitted in Honda production car. With a robust motorsports division, Honda had significant development resources at its disposal and made extensive use of them. Respected Japanese Formula One driver Satoru Nakajima, for example, was involved with Honda in the NSX's early on-track development at Suzuka race circuit, where he performed many endurance distance duties related to chassis tuning. Brazilian Formula One World Champion Ayrton Senna, who won many races in Formula One with Honda before his death in 1994, was considered Honda's main innovator in convincing the company to stiffen the NSX's chassis further after initially testing the car at Honda's Suzuka GP circuit in Japan. Senna further helped refine the original NSX's suspension tuning and handling by spending a whole day test driving prototypes and reporting his findings to Honda engineers after each of the day's five testing sessions.Andrew Frankel, \\"Hondas NSX Shows Why Ayrton was the Greatest\\" Sunday Times UK Article- September 1, 2002 Senna also tested the NSX at the N√ºrburgring and other race tracks.Honda Motor Co. NSX Introduction Video As a result of Senna's input, Honda took the NS-X prototype to the Nurburgring to tune the chassis stiffness. Over the course of several months, the chassis was refined in a painstaking process: Nakajima would drive a lap on the circuit and then discuss with the Honda engineers where he felt flex in the chassis. The engineers would hand-weld aluminum braces in the area they believed would fix the issue and send the driver back out to confirm. This process was repeated over and over, with the data results sent directly to Honda headquarters in Japan, where it was fed into a Cray supercomputer and translated into reinforcements in the production aluminum monocoque. As a result of this process, the NS-X chassis stiffness increased by over 50% with only a small increase in weight. The suspension development program was similarly far- ranging and took place at the Tochigi Proving Grounds, the Suzuka circuit, the 179-turn N√ºrburgring Course in Germany, HPCC, and Honda's newest test track in Takasu, Hokkaido.pg14,NSX Technical Information and Development History-Honda Motor Corp Honda automobile dealer Bobby Rahal (two-time CART PPG Cup and 1986 Indianapolis 500 champion) also participated in the car's development.St. Antoine, Arthur. \\"The Asphalt Jungle: Ayrton's Car.\\" Motor Trend.  Official launch and production  The transversely mounted 3.0-litre Honda C30A V6 engine The NSX made its first public appearances in 1989, at the Chicago Auto Show in February and at the Tokyo Motor Show in October of that year, receiving positive reviews. Honda revised the car's name from NS-X to NSX before commencement of production and sales. The NSX went on sale in Japan in 1990 at Honda Verno dealership sales channels, supplanting the Prelude as the flagship model. The NSX was sold under Honda's Acura luxury brand starting in November 1990 in North America and Hong Kong. Acura NSX (rear view; 1991) Upon its official debut, the NSX design concept showcased Honda's technology, measuring only in height, making it only taller than the Ford GT40, a GT racing car designed and funded solely to win at LeMans. The Japanese car maker's race track innovations and competitive history were further exemplified on the road by the NSX's ultra-rigid and ultra-light all aluminium monocoque chassis along with front and rear double wishbone suspension, with forged control arms connected to forged alloy wheels. The car additionally boasted the world's first production car engine with titanium connecting rods, forged pistons, and ultra high-revving capabilities ‚Äì the redline was at 8,300 rpm ‚Äì all traits usually associated with track and race engineered cars. The NSX's exterior had a dedicated 23-step paint process, including an aircraft type chromate coating designed for chemically protecting the aluminium bodywork and a waterborne paint for the base coat to achieve a clearer, more vivid top color and a smoother surface finish. Honda NSX (pre facelift) The car's chassis rigidity and cornering/handling capabilities were the results of Formula One driver Ayrton Senna's consultation with NSX's chief engineers while testing the NSX prototype at Honda's Suzuka Circuit during its final development. The NSX was initially assembled at the purpose-built Takanezawa R&D; Plant in Tochigi from 1989 to early 2004, when it was moved to Suzuka Plant for the remainder of its production life. The cars were assembled by approximately 200 of Honda's highest-skilled and most experienced personnel, a team of hand-picked staff with a minimum of ten years assembly experience employed from various other Honda facilities to run the NSX operation. Production of the first generation of the NSX ended on November 30, 2005. Sales in the United States and Canada ended in 2005 and 2000, respectively. As of the end of June 2005, the NSX achieved total worldwide sales of more than 18,000 units in over 15 years.  Variants = NSX-R (1992) = Honda NSX-R While the NSX always was intended to be a world-class sports car, engineers had made some compromises in order to strike a suitable balance between raw performance and daily driveability. For those NSX customers seeking a no- compromise racing experience, Honda decided in 1992 to produce a version of the NSX specifically modified for superior track performance at the expense of customary creature comforts. Thus, the NSX Type R (or NSX-R) was born. Honda chose to use its moniker of Type R to designate the NSX-R's race-oriented capabilities. Honda engineers started with a base NSX coup√© and embarked on an aggressive program of weight reduction. Sound deadening, the audio system, spare tyre, air conditioning system and traction control along with some of the electrical equipment were removed. The power leather seats were replaced with lightweight carbon-kevlar racing seats made by Recaro for Honda. However, electric windows and fore/aft electric seat adjusters were retained. The stock forged alloy wheels were replaced with lighter forged aluminium wheels produced by Enkei, which reduced the car's unsprung weight. The standard leather shift knob was replaced with a sculpted titanium piece. Overall, Honda managed to reduce approximately of weight as compared to the standard NSX, resulting in the NSX-R's final weight of .Yamaguchi,Jack; Road&Track; Magazine, February 1993, Ampersand \\"Honda calls a new tune for a special NSX\\" p28-29 As found by the automotive press such as Car and Driver in their September 1997 issue's comparison of \\"Best Handling Car for more than $30K\\", the NSX, due to its mid-engine layout and rear-end link travel, was susceptible to a sudden oversteer condition during certain cornering maneuvers. While this condition rarely occurred during normal driving conditions, it was much more prevalent on race tracks where speeds were much higher. To address the problem and improve the NSX-R's cornering stability at the limit, Honda added one aluminium bracket under the front battery tray and added one bracket in front of the front radiator to add more chassis rigidity replacing the entire suspension system with a more track oriented unit, featuring a stiffer front sway bar, stiffer suspension bushings, stiffer coil springs and stiffer dampers. The standard NSX has a somewhat rearward bias in its spring and bar rates, where the rear was relatively quite stiff versus the front. This means that the lateral load transfer distribution, or the amount of load that is transferred across the front axle versus the rear while cornering, is rather rear biased. This can make the car quite lively and easy to rotate at low speed, but during high speed cornering, this effect becomes more pronounced and could be a handful to manage. To reduce the tendency to oversteer, Honda fitted softer rear tyres on the NSX. For the NSX-R, Honda reversed the spring bias, placing stiffer springs on the front suspension along with stiffer front sway bar. This shifted the load transfer stiffness balance farther forward, resulting in more rear grip at the expense of front grip; this had the effect of decreasing the oversteer tendency of the car, making it much more stable while cornering at high speeds. Overall, the NSX-R utilises a much stiffer front sway bar along with stiffer springs than the standard NSX (21.0 mm x 2.6 mm front sway bar: front 3.0 kg/mm, rear 4.0 kg/mm for the NSX versus front 8.0 kg/mm, rear 5.7 kg/mm for the NSX-R). Honda also increased the final drive ratio to a 4.235:1 in place of the 4.06:1, which resulted in faster gear changes. This change improved acceleration at the expense of top speed, and a higher locking limited-slip differential was installed. Also, the NSX-R's 3.0-litre engine had a blueprinted and balanced crankshaft assembly which is exactly the same labour-intensive high precision process done for Honda racing car engines built by highly qualified engine technicians. Beginning in late November 1992, Honda produced a limited number of 483 NSX-R variants exclusively for the Japanese domestic market (JDM). Factory optional equipment such as air conditioning, Bose stereo system, carbon fibre interior trim on the centre console as well as the doors and larger wheels painted in Championship White (16-inches at the front and 17-inches at the rear) were available for a hefty premium. Production of the NSX-R ended in September 1995. = NSX-T (1995) = 1995 NSX-T Beginning in 1995, the NSX-T with a removable targa top in black colour was introduced in Japan as a special order option and in North America in March 1995.\\"Acura NSX-T Open-Top Makes World Debut.\\" PR Newswire, 1995. The NSX-T largely replaced the standard coup√© entirely in North America as the only version available post 1994 and all NSXs thereafter were available in targa bodystyle, with two notable exceptions: the Zanardi Special Edition NSX in 1999; and a handful of special order post-1997/pre-2002 3.2-litre base model cars- both of which retained the original hardtop configuration. The European market continued to offer both body styles. The removable roof resulted in decreased chassis rigidity and Honda added about 100 pounds (45 kg) of structural reinforcements to compensate, including significantly thicker frame sidesill rocker panels (the body component which contributes most to the chassis's rigidityNSX Technical Information and Development History p. 16, Honda Motor Corp), bulkheads, roof pillars and the addition of new front/rear bulkhead and floorpan crossmembers. The targa models, manufactured for the rest of the NSX's production run through 2005, sacrificed weight and some of the original coup√©'s chassis rigidity in return for an open cockpit driving experience. In addition to this major change, all subsequent NSX-Ts (1995‚Äì2001) had smaller- diameter front sway bars, slightly stiffer front springs, softer rear springs and firmer shock-dampersNSX Wiki: Suspension Tech Session by Don Erb, Comptech USA to improve ride comfort and tyre wear while reducing the tendency towards oversteer common in mid-engined vehicles. The small handful of special ordered, base model \\"hardtop\\" NSX's from 1997‚Äì2001, still retained the original black roof. All other roofs post 1995 were now body-coloured instead of black, although in Japan, the two-tone black roof/body colour was still available as an optional feature. A lighter version of the variable-ratio, electric-assisted power steering rack, previously found exclusively in the cars equipped with the automatic transmission, became standard on all models. Starting in 1995, the 5-speed transmission's second gear ratio was lowered by 4.2% to improve driveability and provide better response and automatic transmissions received an optional Formula One-inspired Sport Shift with a unique steering column mounted electronic shifter. Manual transmission cars received an improved Torque Reactive limited-slip differential ‚Äì when combined with a new Throttle-By-Wire system, increased corner exit speeds by 10%. Other innovations beginning in 1995 included a new and lighter exhaust system and muffler configuration for greater efficiency and lower emissions, an OBD-II onboard diagnostic system, improvements in the Traction Control System (TCS) and newly developed fuel injectors. = 1997 performance upgrades = In 1997, Honda introduced the NSX's biggest performance upgrade for all of its worldwide markets. Engine displacement was increased from 3.0 L to 3.2 LAcura NSX V6-3.2L DOHC (VTEC) (1997).NSX V6-3.2L DOHC (VTEC) (1997) Workshop Manual. using a thinner fiber-reinforced metal (FRM) cylinder liner. The exhaust manifold was reconfigured and made of stainless steel header pipes rather than a cast-iron manifold for improved performance and lighter weight. The increased flow from this new configuration was a key contributor to the 20 additional horsepower drawn from the new engine. This revised 3.2 L C32B engine provided a substantial increase to power output: from to while torque increased from to (for cars equipped with manual transmission only). The net result increased the power to weight ratio of the NSX by 7%. The 4-speed automatic model retained its 3.0 L engine and 252 hp power output. Another big change was the adoption of a 6-speed manual transmission with closer gear ratios and the addition of 3rd to 4th gear dual cone synchronizers. To handle the new engine's added torque and power the small diameter twin-disc clutch system of the 5-speed was replaced by a dual-mass low-inertia single disc clutch system. To offset the weight increase of the new 6-speed transmission and larger brake rotors, which had increased diameter from to , key body parts were made with a new aluminium alloy that was up to 50% stronger allowing the thinner lighter material to be used in the doors, fenders, and front and rear deck lids without any sacrifice of strength and rigidity. Using this hi- strength alloy the net curb weight increase, despite adding many improvements, was only . Other notable changes included a keyless entry system, vehicle immobilizer system and inclusion of electric power steering on the hardtop coupe trims. The combination of slightly increased power and torque and a new 6-speed transmission, with ratios optimised to improve straight-line acceleration, produced better performance numbers over previous models than the modest increases would suggest. Motor Trend and Road & Track's (Feb 97) tests of the 3.2 L 6-speed equipped NSX-T (Targa) resulted in 0‚Äì60 mph acceleration times of 4.8 and 5.0 seconds and quarter-mile times of 13.3 and 13.5 seconds respectively. 0‚Äì60 mph times dropped to as low as 4.5 seconds in the coup√© 3.2 L variant as recorded by Car and Driver in their August 1998 0‚Äì150‚Äì0 issue. The NSX proved to be the fastest ever tested in North America when tested by the magazine. When Car and Driver tested the 1999 Zanardi special edition coup√© a year later it resulted in a 0‚Äì60 mph acceleration time of 4.8 seconds and a 13.2-second quarter-mile time. Although magazine tests for the later face-lift NSX were rare, Honda apparently kept improving the engine as Sports and Exotic Car magazine noted in a farewell article on a 2005 NSX-T and recorded a 0‚Äì60 mph acceleration time of 4.7 seconds and a 13.1 second quarter-mile time. = 1997 NSX Type S (JDM) = Along with the engine displacement increase in 1997, Japan exclusively received the NSX Type S. The Type S was intended to be a \\"winding road\\" optimized trim option and incorporated several weight-reducing features to improve performance: Titanium Shift Knob, MOMO Zagato-style steering wheel, BBS lightweight aluminium wheels(16\\"/17\\") and a lightweight rear spoiler. The Type S also carried over several weight reducing features from the earlier NSX-R: Recaro full bucket carbon-kevlar Alcantara/leather seats, mesh design engine cover, single-pane rear glass, manual rack and pinion steering and a lightweight battery. Unlike the NSX-R, which used the black roof from the original NSX, the Type S was offered with a body-color matching roof. Overall, the weight reduction efforts resulted in a curb weight of for the Type S, which was some lighter than the standard NSX coupe. However, due to its premium trim level, customers could add options like navigation, electric power steering, HID xenon headlights and fog lights, partially negating some of the weight savings. Indeed, the NSX Type S was the most expensive NSX trim model available in 1997 at ¬•10,357,000 (or $85,000 in 1997 dollars). Honda also extensively revised the Type S suspension to incorporate much stiffer front dampers and a thicker rear sway bar. Honda produced 209 NSX Type S units between 1997 and 2001. = 1997 NSX Type S-Zero (JDM) = Along with the Type S, Honda offered the NSX Type S-Zero for customers who desired a track-day weekend car and who would normally purchase the now-discontinued NSX-R. Designated \\"Zero\\" to indicate extreme weight reduction, the S-Zero is a more circuit-oriented version of the standard Type S. Handling was improved for the circuit by using the NA1 NSX-R suspension but retaining the Type S' thicker 19.1 mm rear sway bar. The S-Zero also ditched the dual mass flywheel clutch and reverted back to the lighter, more direct dual-disc clutch from the original NSX 5-speed transmission. Unlike the standard Type S, the S-Zero did not offer cruise control, stereo, power door locks, airbags, traction control, power steering, fog lights or a navigation system. Air conditioning, however, was the only option. Much of the sound deadening material was also removed to reduce weight. All of this weight reduction resulted in making the S-Zero 50 kg (110 lb) lighter than the Type S, weighing in at . Combining extreme weight reduction with the power and performance improvements of the new 3.2L engine and 6-speed transmission, the S-Zero could lap the Suzuka circuit 1.5 seconds faster than the already formidable NSX-R. Only 30 NSX Type-S Zeros were produced between 1997 and 2001, making it the rarest version of the NSX next to the five homologation special NSX-R GT cars. = 1999 NSX Alex Zanardi edition (USA) = Produced exclusively for the United States, the NSX Alex Zanardi Edition was introduced in 1999 to commemorate Alex Zanardi's two back-to-back CART IndyCar championship wins for Honda in 1997 and 1998. Only 51 examples were built, and they were available only in Formula Red to reflect the color of the winning car Zanardi drove for Chip Ganassi Racing. The Zanardi Edition was similar to the Japanese market NSX Type S. Visible differences between the Zanardi Edition and the Type S were the Zanardi's left-hand drive configuration, black leather and suede seats with red stitching, airbag-equipped Acura steering wheel, and a brushed-aluminium plaque with an engraved Acura logo, Zanardi's signature, and a serial number on the rear bulkhead. Total vehicle weight was reduced by as compared to the NSX-T, through the use of a fixed roof, lighter rear spoiler, single pane rear glass, lightweight BBS alloy wheels, a lighter battery, and a manual rack-and-pinion steering system in place of the electric power steering. Zanardi Number 0 was a press car that also appeared in auto shows across the country. In a handling test in Road & Track's June 1999 issue, the Zanardi NSX placed second against the Dodge Viper GTS-R, Lotus Esprit, Porsche 911 Carrera 4, Ferrari F355 Spider, and Chevrolet Corvette C5 Coup√©. The car was also featured in Car and Driver's July 1999 issue before being sold to a private individual. Zanardi Number 1 belongs to Zanardi himself and was not given a North American VIN. The car is rumored to have been modified by Honda with hand-activated throttle, braking, and shifting mechanisms to accommodate Zanardi's loss of both legs resulting from his Lausitzring crash in 2001. Zanardi numbers 2 through 50 were sold to the general public through dealers. = 2002 NSX facelift = Honda NSX (post- facelift) In December 2001, the NSX received a facelift in order to keep the car more modern looking like its competitors. The original pop-up headlamps were replaced with fixed xenon HID headlamp units, along with slightly wider rear tyres to complement a revised suspension. The gauge faces changed to a blue shade and, in 2004, the shift knob was changed to a weighted metal ball from the prior leather-wrapped plastic. Front spring rates were increased from 3.2 kg/m to 3.5 kg/m, rear spring rates were increased from 3.8 kg/m to 4.0 kg/m and the diameter of the rear stabilizer bar increased from 17.5 mm to 19.1 mm with a 2.3 mm wall thickness. The tail light housings were also revised along with the rear spoiler, which now included a small flap on the deck lid. The rear valence was lowered and wrapped around the car to revised side skirts. These changes made the car appear to sit lower on the ground. Due to the changes in design, the drag coefficient slightly dropped to 0.30 which contributed to improvement in acceleration and top speed with an improvement in the acceleration time by 0.2 seconds and an increased top speed of . Acura NSX (post-facelift) The hardtop coup√© was no longer available in North America from 2002 onwards, but coupes could still be ordered in Japan. The NSX Type S also received the same cosmetic updates, with a slight revision to the suspension replacing the linear rate springs with progressive springs. The S-Zero trim model was cancelled due to the re-introduction of the NSX-R. The NSX was now made available in a number of exterior colours with either a matching or black interior to provide a number of possible colour combinations. A 4-speed automatic transmission with manual-type shift option also became available. = NSX-R facelift (2002) = Honda NSX-R (post- facelift) Rear view A second iteration of the NSX-R was unveiled in 2002, again exclusively in Japan. As with the first NSX-R, weight reduction was the primary focus for performance enhancement. The NSX-R was again based on the coup√©, due to its lighter weight and more rigid construction. Carbon fibre was used to a large extent throughout the body components to reduce weight, including a larger and more aggressive rear spoiler, vented hood and deck lid. The vented hood was said to be the largest one-piece carbon-fiber hood used on a production road car. Additionally, the original NSX-R's weight reduction techniques were repeated, including deletion of the audio system, sound insulation and air conditioning. Furthermore, the power steering was removed. A single-pane rear divider was again used, as were Recaro carbon-kevlar racing seats. Finally, larger yet lighter wheels resulted in a total weight reduction of almost to . The 3.2 L DOHC V6 engine received special attention as well. Each car's engine was hand-assembled by a skilled technician using techniques normally reserved for racing programs. Components of the rotating assembly (pistons, rods and crankshaft) were precision weighed and matched so that all components fell within a very small tolerance of weight differential. Then, the entire rotating assembly was balanced to a level of accuracy, ten times than that of a typical NSX engine. This balancing and blueprinting process significantly reduced parasitic loss of power due to inertial imbalance, resulting in a more powerful, free-revving powerplant with an excellent throttle response.http://world.honda.com/NSX/technology/t5.html Officially, Honda maintains that the power output of the 2002 NSX-R's engine is rated at , which is identical to the standard NSX. The automotive press, however, has long speculated that the true output of the engine is higher. Creating the impression of increased power, the accelerator was re-tuned, becoming much more sensitive to movement, particularly at the beginning of the pedal's new shorter stroke. This, coupled with the harsh suspension, makes it difficult for the driver to drive smoothly at low speeds on streets with even slight bumps. The lack of power steering has also been noted by drivers as making the car tiring and hard to steer at low speed. The result of Honda's second NSX-R effort was a vehicle that could challenge the latest sports car models on the track, despite having a base design that was more than 15 years old. For example, noted Japanese race and test driver Motoharu Kurosawa piloted a 2002 NSX-R around the N√ºrburgring road course in 7:56, a time equal to a Ferrari 360 Challenge Stradale.Best Motoring, August 2002 The NSX-R accomplished this feat despite being out-powered by the Ferrari by over . = NSX-R GT (2005) = Production of NSX-R GT, as limited edition of NSX-R, was approved at Honda solely to win at the JGTG and Super GT, because its production-based race car homologation required additional handicap weight for NSX reasoning by such as relatively small aero-projected-area and mid-ship layout, and overcoming the handicap was very difficult in 2003 and 2004 seasons. As the Super GT rule required at least five production cars for any race car version to compete, the production of NSX-R GT was limited to the minimum number, and only one car was actually sold. One clear difference between the second generation NSX-R is the addition of a non-functional garnish snorkel attached to the rear window of the car. In the JGTC NSX race cars however, this snorkel is fully functional, feeding outside air to an individual throttle body intake plenum. The NSX-R GT also has 180 mm longer and 90 mm wider body with aggressive aerodynamic components such as an extended front spoiler lip and large rear diffuser were used as well. It was also speculated that the NSX-R GT incorporates more weight savings over the NSX-R. It has the same 3.2L DOHC V6 engine.  Motorsports = 24 Hours of Le Mans = 1995 class-winning NSX GT2 The NSX GT1 and GT2 Le Mans race cars started out as factory NSX-R shells. 11 of these shells were shipped to TC Prototypes in England, where they were extensively re-worked in preparation for race duty. A custom dry carbon fiber tub was bonded to the interior, and additional dry carbon fiber pieces were used to reinforce the already stiff chassis. The suspension was completely replaced by a custom setup with race dampers and aluminum control arms mated to center-nut style wheel hubs. TC added wide body fenders to accommodate the wider race tires and improve downforce. The C30A engine was extensively revised to include a dry sump oiling system, larger cams, inconel exhaust headers and, for the GT2 cars, a massive carbon fiber intake plenum with six individual throttle bodies. The GT1 engines received a turbocharger with a custom dual-plenum aluminum manifold. Using bespoke engine management, the GT2 engines produced nearly 400 bhp (a 130 bhp increase from the production version) and the turbocharged GT1 engines produced over 600 bhp, making them the most powerful engines Honda ever used in the NSX. Both engines were mated to a Hewland 6-speed sequential transmission, the use of which would later plague the cars in the Le Mans race. The NSX made three appearances at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, in 1994, 1995, and 1996. Three Honda NSXs were entered in the 1994 24 Hours of Le Mans. Cars numbers 46, 47 and 48 were prepared and run by team Kremer Racing Honda, with Team Kunimitsu assisting and driving the number 47 car. All were in the GT2 class, and all completed the race, but placed 14th, 16th and 18th.24 Hours of LeMans, 1994. Three Honda NSXs were entered in the 1995 24 Hours of Le Mans. Honda's factory team brought two NSXs which were entered in the GT1 class numbered 46 (naturally aspirated)https://www.racingsportscars.com/chassis/photo/NA001.html and 47 (turbocharged)https://www.racingsportscars.com/chassis/photo/95T%200001.html. Team Kunimitsu Honda prepared and entered a naturally aspirated NSX into the GT2 class numbered 84; a fourth GT2 NSX was entered by Nakajima Racing with number 85 but failed to pre-qualify. Car 46 finished but was not classified for failing to complete 70% of the distance of the race winner. Car 47 did not finish due to clutch and gearbox failure. Car 84, driven by Keiichi Tsuchiya, Akira Iida, and Kunimitsu Takahashi, finished 8th overall winning the GT2 class after completing 275 laps. This NSX was featured in the original Gran Turismo, with the GT1 class car being featured in the Japanese version of the game instead.24 Hours of LeMans, 1995. For the 1996 24 Hours of Le Mans, only the Team Kunimitsu Honda NSX returned with the same drivers. It completed 305 laps to finish in the 16th position overall, and third in the GT2 class.24 Hours of LeMans, 1996. = JGTC and Super GT = In 1996 season, prior to the formation of factory-backed team, Team Kunimitsu entered the first NSX in the series, based on the 1995 Le Mans GT2 car in specification. Without factory support, the car's best finish was seventh in the August Fuji Speedway race. For the 1997 season, Honda officially entered the series with factory- supported NSX, which featured a chassis developed by Dome, based on the collaboration experience in JTCC series with Honda Accord and engines by Mugen. The car's debut race was at the 2nd round of the series at Fuji Speedway, with a first pole position at the fifth round race at Mine Circuit. In 1998 season, the NSX obtained pole position at all the seven rounds of the series. The car also managed its first win at the Japan Special GT-Cup in Fuji and also won at all the subsequent four remaining rounds of the series. However, the team suffered a minor setback when the #18 Dome car was disqualified from the final race of the season. 2000 season on display at the Honda Collection Hall For 2000, the \\"Phase 2\\" NSX-GT machine was introduced, where the car's engine mounting was lowered and a Formula Nippon-specification transmission was used. Although the transmission was proven to be fragile, Ryo Michigami and his team, Mugen √ó Dome Project's #16 Castrol NSX, managed to get the first Drivers' and Teams' Championship title for Honda; he had done so without scoring a single win. Following a facelift in 2002 to match the road car's facelift the previous year, the Phase 3 NSX-GT featured changes to the car's V6 engine to prepare for the relaxed regulations for 2003, where the car's C32B engine was mounted longitudinally instead of transversely as per the road car. Similar to the setup used in modern Lamborghinis, the gearbox is located in the center tunnel under the cockpit and is connected to the rear differential by a driveshaft. Prior to rule changes beginning in the 2003 season, the Super GT/GT500 NSX was powered by a specially modified version of the C32B V6 engine. Using a stroke crankshaft from Toda Racing, the naturally aspirated engine displaced 3.5-litres and produced nearly . Beginning in 2004, Honda used a turbocharged C30A engine, outputting similar horsepower, but the engine cooling proved troublesome and Honda reverted to naturally aspirated C32B the following year. For the newly renamed 2005 Super GT Series, Honda created the NSX-R GT model to allow the Phase 4 NSX-GT to allow the car to have extended overhangs, lip-spoiler and rear-diffuser as effective aerodynamics measures. This allowed the car to obtain ten pole positions and five wins in both 2005 and 2006. 2007 season For the 2007 season, stepped floors was introduced to reduce aerodynamic ground effects. Even with these changes, the Phase 5 NSX-GT won both Team's Championship and Drivers' Championship thanks to Autobacs Racing Team Aguri (ARTA) with Ralph Firman and Daisuke It≈ç. The NSX continued to be used as the works Honda car in the GT500 class, even though it is no longer in production, until it was replaced 2010 with the HSV-010. New 2014 regulations however will render the HSV-010 obsolete; Honda's 2014-spec GT500 car is to be based on the concept version of the new NSX, followed with a Group GT3 version from 2017 onwards. The NSX-GT was used in the series between 1997‚Äì2009, and it was one of the most successful cars to race in the series. It won 36 races, 45 pole positions, three teams' and two drivers' championships and finished runner-up in the drivers' championship six times when it didn't win it. It also won the Suzuka 1000km four times; in 1999, 2000, 2003 and 2004. It is the only Japanese car in the series to score pole position and fastest lap in every race of the season, holds the record for the most consecutive wins at six and is the first car to win the championship prior to the final race. A GT300 specification NSX won the GT300 class titles in 2004 and finished second the following year.  Honda NSX Super GT specifications  The champion machine's specification in 2007 season: Under 2007 regulation, phase 5 NSX-GT was constructed as a new machine. * Drivetrain: MR - longitudinally front-to-back layout * Engine: V6 (C32B based) DOHC NA 3,494 cc * Length: 4,610 mm - as same as NSX-R GT (2005) * Width: 2,000 mm * Wheelbase: 2,530 mm - as same as all NSX * Transmission: Hewland 6-speed sequential * Tires: Bridgestone (Front 330/40T18, Rear 330/45R17) The final specification in 2009 season: NSX-GT for 2008 season was specially allowed to use as the exception of 2009 regulation with receiving performance adjustment and handicap weight. * Drivetrain: MR - special exception in 2009 regulation which requires FR in principle. * Engine: V6 (C32B based) DOHC NA 3,396 cc - downsized corresponding to 2009 regulation to make it equal to others = World Challenge = The NSX was entered in the SCCA World Challenge prior to the redesign in 2002. It won the championship in 1997, driven by Peter Cunningham. =Pikes Peak International Hill Climb= In 2012 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, LoveFab Inc., lead by Cody Loveland, and Honda Performance Development (HPD), lead by James Robinson, brought in their 1991 Acura NSX based race cars into this field. Loveland's machine had monstrous spoilers and aerodynamic bodywork. The Robinson's machine had wide-body which is same as 1995 Le Mans race car, and his team continued to use the machine in 2013 and 2014 races with modifications. = Safety car = Since the beginning of the NSX's production, the car has been used as a safety car at the Suzuka Circuit, even for the Japanese Grand Prix in its early years of production, and is still used at the circuit. The car is also used for the same role at Twin Ring Motegi, the other circuit owned by Honda.

As a result of employing this metabolic strategy, cells excrete (or \\"overflow\\") metabolites like lactate, acetate and ethanol. Incomplete oxidation of growth substrates yields less energy (e.g. ATP) than complete oxidation through respiration, and yet overflow metabolism - known as the Warburg effect in the context of cancer \\\\- occurs ubiquitously among fast-growing cells, including bacteria, fungi and mammalian cells. Based on experimental studies of acetate overflow in Escherichia coli, recent research has offered a general explanation for the association of overflow metabolism with fast growth. According to this theory, the enzymes required for respiration are more costly than those required for partial oxidation of glucose. That is, if the cell were to produce enough of these enzymes to support fast growth with respiratory metabolism, it would consume much more energy, carbon and nitrogen (per unit time) than supporting fast growth with an incompletely oxidative metabolism (e.g. fermentation). Given that cells have limited energy resources and fixed physical volume for proteins, there is thought to be a trade-off between efficient energy capture through central metabolism (i.e. respiration) and fast growth achieved through high central-metabolic fluxes (e.g. through fermentation as in yeast). As an alternative explanation, it was suggested that cells could be limited by the rate with which they can dissipate Gibbs energy to the environment. Using combined thermodynamic and stoichiometric metabolic models in flux balance analyses with (i) growth maximization as objective function and (ii) an identified limit in the cellular Gibbs energy dissipation rate, correct predictions of physiological parameters, intracellular metabolic fluxes and metabolite concentrations were achieved.

He is believed to be one of the first doctors in the United States to perform cataract surgery. Early life John Tyler was born in Prince George's County, Maryland on 29 June 1763 to Samuel and Susanna (DuVal) Tyler. Career He began his study of medicine under Dr. Smith of Georgetown, later becoming a student at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, from which he received his diploma. While in London, he studied under Dr. Abernethy. He began practicing in Frederick, Maryland in 1786. He was one of the first oculists in the United States, as well as one of the earliest doctors to perform cataract surgery. Couching had been performed in the United States since the 1760s, and Tyler was regionally well known for his skill at that procedure. He was a founding member of the Medical and Chirurgical Faculty of the State of Maryland, and was also a member of the Masonic lodge of Frederick. He was an officer during the Whiskey Rebellion. He served as a Maryland state senator for Frederick County in 1804, and was an elector of Thomas Jefferson. Spite House Tyler is also known for the spite house he built in Frederick on West Church Street, next door to his own house, to prevent the extension of Record Street. Construction is said to have started the night before a city meeting to condemn the land, owned by Tyler, through which the proposed extension would run. The house is on the National Register of Historic Places. Later life At some point in his life, Tyler owned a greyhound named Guess, who is immortalized in a cast-iron statue in front of his home on W. Church Street. He retired from his medical practice as he began to lose his hearing. He died in Frederick on 15 October 1841.

Biography  Nightingill was born in 1826 in Ashland County, Ohio. He worked at the painter's trade with his father and brother. In 1849, he moved to California during the California Gold Rush by crossing the Great Plains. He was elected the chief engineer of the Marysville fire department in the 1856. Furthermore, Nightingill was elected marshal of the police department of the city later that year. He held both position and served as marshal until 1857. In May 1858, Nightingill went to the Fraser River to explore and prospect and he returned in autumn of the following year. In May 1860, Nightingill moved from California to Nevada and joined the Washoe Regiment, a militia, that was established in response to the First Battle of Pyramid Lake. He was captain of Company C, that had 38 members and was nicknamed the \\"Truckee Rangers\\". His company fought against the Native Americans and then made an expedition through the Black Rock Desert. During the expedition, he discovered Surprise Valley. Nightingill was appointed the first sheriff of Humboldt County on December 10, 1861 by James W. Nye. His term ended after the elections in January 1862. During that election, Nightingill was elected the first treasurer of Humboldt County. He served as treasurer until the next elections, that were held half a year later. In the next year, Nightingill was elected one of the 39 delegates to the Nevada's first Constitutional Convention, that was held in November and December 1863. Also, he served on the state seal committee. At the Convention, Nightingill represented Humboldt County. Records from the Convention stated that Nightingill lived in Unionville, was a sign painter and was unmarried. Although the Convention had produced a constitution, it was rejected by an election in January 1864. After Nevada became a state, Nightingill served between 1864 and 1867 as the first State Controller of Nevada. As a Republican, he defeated his opponent, Democrat J.P. Gallagher, in the November 1864 elections. Nightingill received a total of 9,842 votes (60%). His salary was set by the Nevada Constitution at $3,600 per year. During his term, he got a lung inflammation and he suffered from lung problems since. Almost a year after his term ended, Nightingill was appointed sheriff of Ormsby County by the County Commission on December 19, 1867. His predecessor, Timothy G. Smith, died two days before Nightingill was appointed. Nightingill resigned in September of the following year due to health problems. In 1870, he died in Carson City of tuberculosis at the age of 43. Nightingill was buried in Marysville. When he died, he had been married for some time. The Nightingale Mountains were named after Nightingill.

History  Daewonsa Temple (Korean: ÎåÄÏõêÏÇ¨, Chinese: Â§ßÊ∫êÂØ∫, Pronounced ‚ÄúDay-won-sa‚Äù) was established in 548 by Patriarch Ven. Yeongi. Originally named Pyeongwonsa Temple, it was reduced to ashes during the Japanese invasion (1592‚Äì1597) but reconstructed in 1685 and renamed Daewonam Hermitage. It was again rebuilt in 1890 and renamed Daewonsa Temple. In 1948, during the Yeosun Rebellion, the temple was burned to the ground by government forces. In September 1955, Ven. Beobil, a Buddhist nun, took office as its head, and launched its reconstruction, eventually completing the temple we see today.  Landscape  Nestled deep in an eastern fold of Mt. Jirisan, Daewonsa Temple is occupied by Buddhist nuns. Sarijeon Hall has a stone pagoda standing in front of it and it is where many nuns practice intensive Seon meditation during the annual three-month summer and winter retreats. The temple is surrounded by great scenic beauty. A mountain stream runs through the valley that extends from the parking lot at the temple entrance to the temple compound. The water rushing between and over the uniquely shaped rocks give it an uncommon charm. The path to the entrance is lined with tall, straight pines called ‚Äúdiamond pines.‚Äù  Cultural properties  The Multi-Story Stone Pagoda (Treasure No. 1112) enshrines the Buddha's relics which Vinaya Master Jajang Yulsa brought from China. During the Joseon era, the pagoda was repaired twice, in 1724 by Seon Master Taeheum, and in 1784 by Seon Master Ogin. It was then that 72 relics (sarira) were found. In the most recent renovation, the relics were divided and enshrined in the pagoda's 3rd, 5th and 7th stories. Other cultural objects include: a Painting of Buddhist Guardian Deities (Tangible Cultural Heritage of South Gyeongsang Province No. 361) and Banja (suspended gong; Tangible Cultural Heritage of South Gyeongsang Province No. 362).

They used three types of ammunition ‚Äì Common shell (for use against buildings or fortifications), shrapnel shell (for use any Infantry or Cavalry) and case shot (for close range use against 'soft' targets). Ignition was through a copper lined vent at the breech end of the gun. A copper friction tube would be inserted and a lanyard attached. When the lanyard was pulled the tube would ignite, firing the gun. A number of different fuzes could be used enabling shells to either burst at a pre-determined time (and range), or on impact. A typical rate of fire was one round per minute.  Operation  The Howitzer was normally deployed in batteries of four guns. Each gun was pulled by a team of elephants. It had a crew of nine men. In addition to each gun, a limbered ammunition trailer was also deployed with each gun.  Service history  8-inch RML Howizer, Lydd, c1903 Rifled Muzzle Loading howitzers were selected by the Royal Artillery in the 1870s to replace obsolete smooth bore Mortars and howitzers, as they had great range and accuracy. They were only semi- mobile and were used by Garrison batteries of the Royal Artillery in India, drawn by elephants, or kept in fixed emplacements or fortifications. For example, by the 1890s Fort Widley had two howitzers on travelling siege carriages that could be moved to wherever they were needed. Some were used by batteries of reserve units in the United Kingdom.

Located on Foreside Road, overlooking Casco Bay, the landscaped properties include a house and former carriage house designed by John Calvin Stevens and John Howard Stevens in 1912. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history Until the early 20th century, the area known as Falmouth Foreside was a predominantly rural and agricultural area. By 1910 a full-scale conversion of the area to coastal estate homes was well underway, with landowners selling off coastal properties for development. The family of Ralph S. Norton, an insurance executive based in Portland, owned a small farm in the area, and Norton decided in 1911 to build a more substantial summer house on a high point overlooking Casco Bay. He retained John Howard Stevens, who developed a plan that included a house, carriage barn, and landscaped garden terraces. It is surmised that Carl Rust Parker, a prominent Portland landscape architect, was involved in the design of the grounds. The Norton estate was originally several hundred acres, most of which has since been subdivided (including the property of the Portland Yacht Club). Ownership of the house and barn was divided in 1967, after which the barn was converted to a residence. The surviving Norton estate properties are accessed via private drive on the southeast side of Foreside Road (Maine State Route 88), between Old Powerhouse Road, which provides access to the yacht club, and Ramsdell Road. The drive is marked by a low stone wall with posts, and a small gatehouse on the right side, designed by John Howard Stevens. The main house is at the left side of the end of the drive, while the carriage barn is to the right. The house is a handsome 2-1/2 story structure, with an eclectic blend of Prairie School, Shingle, and Colonial Revival styles. Its interior finish is predominantly in Arts and Crafts styling that was fashionable at the time of its construction. The house's original view to the bay is now obscured by a house built on a subdivision of the estate.

It follows the western shore of St. J√∏rgen's Lake, linking Gammel Kongevej in the south with Rosen√∏rns All√© in the north. The embankment and lakeside path on the east side of the street is called Svineryggen (English: The Hog's Back). History=Vodroffsg√•rd industrial complex= Vodroffsg√•rd Vodroff Mill The area west of St. J√∏rgen's Lake was the site of some outworks before it was ceded to quartermaster Georg Julius Wodroff in 1698 as a result of the Mercantilistic policies of the time. He established the Vodroffg√•rd watermill at the mouth of the Ladeg√•rd Canal. It was originally built as a fulling mill but was soon adapted for other use. In 1802, he obtained a 12 year monopoly on the manufacture of rolled barley and snus as well as on operating sharpening and polishing mills within a distance of three Danish miles from Copenhagen. From 1733, Vodroffg√•rd was used for manufacturing ship sails with a monopoly on deliveries to the Danish navy. Hartvig Marcus Frisch, director of the Royal Danish Greenland Company, owned the property from 1794 to 1803. The industrial activities ended in the 1790s and the estate was then used as a summer retreat for changing owners until it was transformed into an entertainment venue under the name I Vodrofflund in 1868. =The new street= The area west of St. J√∏rgen's Lake viewed on a map detail from 1857 Marstrand's Brewery om c- 1888, illustration by Janus Laurentius Ridter from Danmarks Industrielle Etablissementer The street was created when the so-called Demarcation Line was moved to the lakes in the 1850s. The brewery Marstrands Bryggeri was established at No. 25 im 1865 and soon developed into one of the largest producers of small beer in the country. It merged with several other breweries under the name De Forenede Bryggerier in 1891. The buildings were demolished in 1976.

While not widely known in his home country of Ireland, his music is very popular with the online gaming community, and he has been described as Ireland's most successful indie musician. Miracle of Sound is generally a one-man-band, though Dunne occasionally collaborates with other musicians and singers. His songs vary widely in genre, typically using a genre that best fits the song's subject; these have included rock, pop, electronic rock, hard rock, heavy metal, alternative rock, tribal music, dubstep, jazz, and even doo-wop. History=Early life and origins of Miracle of Sound= Dunne is the son of late Irish poet Se√°n Dunne and is from Cork, Ireland. Before starting Miracle of Sound, Dunne spent 15 years playing in various groups. As part of his previous band, Lotus Lullaby, he and his bandmates competed in and won the Bank of Ireland National Student Music Awards in 2006, as well as the Murphy's Battle of the Bands earlier the same year. After the break-up of Lotus Lullaby, Dunne became inspired by the video games he was playing and wrote several songs based on his favourite games, intended on conveying the atmosphere of the game or the mood of the characters. He began with the song \\"Gordon Freeman Saved My Life\\", based on the character from the Half-Life franchise. The song amassed 15,000 views in one night on YouTube, something Dunne had struggled to do for years. He continued with \\"The Ballad of Clay Carmine\\", which had another positive reception, and Dunne realised that he had found a significant niche audience and he continued to write songs based on video games. One of these early songs, \\"Commander Shepard\\", based on the character from the Mass Effect series of the same name, went viral and eventually amassed millions of views, leading to rapid rise in popularity for the musician. =Coordination with game developers= Following his success with \\"Commander Shepard\\", Dunne eventually met with the marketing team from BioWare, the creative team behind the Mass Effect series, while he was at gamescom in Germany in August 2011. There he released another Mass Effect song, \\"Normandy\\", based on the ending of Mass Effect 2. Coordinating with BioWare, Dunne became involved in the marketing campaign for the next game in the series, Mass Effect 3. Both voice actors for the male and the female Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect series (Mark Meer and Jennifer Hale, respectively) performed dramatic readings of parts of the song \\"Commander Shepard\\" before the release of the Mass Effect 3, to raise publicity. BioWare subsequently sent Dunne advance footage for use in making a song and accompanying music video based on Mass Effect 3, so that his release of \\"Take it Back\\" could coincide with the game's launch. A line from his song \\"Commander Shepard\\" was also referenced in Mass Effect 3, with a character telling the player to \\"fight like a Krogan.\\" Dunne later made two additional songs based on the game; \\"Crucible\\" and \\"Kalros\\". Some of his songs have also been used within videogames. His song based on the indie CRPG Wasteland 2, titled \\"Cries of a Dead World\\" was included in the game itself, being used for the end credits. One of Miracle of Sound's earliest songs, \\"Gordon Freeman Saved My Life\\", was later included as a playable song in the game Rock Band. His song \\"Keepers\\", in collaboration with Marcin Przyby≈Çowicz, was written for the game Seven: The Days Long Gone and will be the official theme song of the upcoming isometric RPG, and was used in the game's trailer. =Music and reception by critics= In traditional video game style, his albums are named in increasing levels ‚Äì Level 1, Level 2 and so on. However, he has also released two other non-gaming-related albums. His instrumental album called Vistas had a mixed reception, receiving 3.5 out of 5 stars from Nick Mongiardo of Sputnik Music who said \\"Vistas has some issues with pacing and contains some jarring shifts in style, but anyone who enjoys chilled out instrumental music will love this.\\" His seventh album, Metal Up, a heavy metal compilation with some songs based on Irish folklore, topped the iTunes Metal chart for 2 days following its release in early 2015. Metal Up was described as mix of classic rock, hard rock, and metal, and was praised by Firstherd for its Celtic influences in some songs which were \\"very original when placed in a metal framework\\". The album was also given a 5 out of 5 score by Rock Review. Shortly before the Wasteland 2 Director's Cut re-release in 2015, Dunne released a parody of the Dire Straits song \\"Money for Nothing\\", titled \\"I want my RPG\\". The lyrics of the song criticise modern free to play games, microtransactions and downloadable content and express the desire for more games of the old CRPG style. He did not include the song on any album, saying on Twitter that \\"It's a parody of someone else's song. Wouldn't feel right to monetise it.\\" Dunne has also used his music to criticise quick time events in his Resident Evil 6 song \\"Wigglesticks\\". It has been suggested that other indie games on limited budgets could improve the quality of their music by employing indie musicians such as Miracle of Sound. Many of his songs have received very positive reviews, such as his doo-wop song \\"Going Nuclear\\", based on the then-upcoming game Fallout 4, which drew praise from video game journalists for matching the tone and style of the game's aesthetic very well. His song \\"The Lucky Ones\\" was considered unique by being written from the point of view of the background characters, rather than the player characters of Tom Clancy's The Division. He has written two songs about the Uncharted franchise \\"Keep Drifting\\" and \\"Here we go Again\\", inspired by the main character's sense of adventure and being a drifter at heart. Nerdist reviewed his song \\"Get the Gang Back\\", based on the popular Blizzard game Overwatch, and called it \\"an incredibly catchy tune\\" with the lyrics \\"mirroring the game's relentlessly positive outlook\\". In late 2016, he released \\"Pawns of War\\", a Battlefield 1 inspired song where Dunne's goal was to fuse the feel of the game's soundtrack with old military marching tunes, creating a composition that focuses on soldiers doomed to be forgotten after being thrown into the \\"meat grinder\\" of WWI. =Collaborative works= Dunne generally works alone, performing or electronically creating all of the instrument tracks for his music and layering the result to create a single track. He provides most of the vocals for his songs himself, plays guitar, bass and keyboard, and can use electronic programs for drums and many other instruments, including orchestral pieces. However, he has collaborated with other artists at times for vocals or other instruments that he cannot play or create electronically. He has worked with several guest vocalists; with Malukah on the song \\"Legends of the Frost\\", with Irish singer Ail√≠n Kennedy on \\"Lady of Worlds\\", with YouTuber Sharm on \\"Fires Fade\\", \\"Mother of Flame\\", and \\"Machine Heart\\", with Lorna Dollery on \\"Dream of the Sky\\", \\"Dream of Goodbye\\", and \\"Evacuate\\", and with singer Karliene on songs such as \\"Ascension\\", \\"Lilac and Violet\\", and \\"My Odyssey\\". He has been featured in the songs of several other artists, including Dan Bull's \\"Metro: Last Light Rap\\", \\"Overwatch Rap\\", and \\"Last Guardian Rap\\", TryHardNinjas' \\"Calling All Ghosts\\", 331Erock's \\"Deadpool Meets Metal\\", as well as JT Machinimas' \\"Let Your Soul Walk Free\\" and \\"Shepherd of this Flock\\". He also had guest musicians Jack O'Rourke (piano) and Gary Baus (saxophone) perform for his jazz song \\"Sweet L.A.\\", and guest musician Gwen Boyle (violin) on \\"Dream of the Sky\\". For his album Metal Up he had two guest musicians, 331Erock and Dave Divilly, who provided guitar solos for \\"I am Alive\\" and \\"Get Your Metal On\\", respectively. From November 2014 to September 2019, Dunne joined video game critic Jim Sterling and gaming journalist Laura Kate Dale (Laura K Buzz on social media) on a weekly podcast, the Podquisition, which primarily discussed video game and pop culture related news. He left the show after episode 250, citing being blocked on Twitter by unnamed figures in the videogame industry who had been criticized by Sterling and/or Dale on the podcast. In late May 2018, Gavin was featured as a guest artist on the Dark Souls-inspired titular track \\"Let There Be Fire\\" from the album of the same name by Florida-based musician Aviators. In late June 2019, Aviators featured as a guest artists on the Bloodborne-inspired track \\"A Thousand Eyes\\". =Sale and distribution of music= From 2011 until February 2015, Dunne released new music videos on The Escapist (an online video gaming website) every two to four weeks, in addition to releasing them on his YouTube channel. Views on YouTube for Dunne have continued to grow, with around 4 million YouTube views per month, and with total views of over 254 million as of July 2019. He makes the majority of his income with sales of his songs and albums on Bandcamp and iTunes, as well as monetisation of his YouTube videos. He has taken an unusual approach to piracy, and has said that he is fine with people pirating his music if they are poor or broke, and encourages them to tell their friends about him, credit him if they use his music, and buy it when they can. In late 2013, multiple copyright strikes were issued by YouTube against Dunne's videos for use of his own music, as well as against other users who had used his music in their videos with permission. All of the strikes were initiated by INDMUSIC, on behalf of TuneCore, the company that distributed Miracle of Sound's songs at the time. Though the incident was resolved successfully, Dunne commented that although TuneCore was trying to help artists, their efforts did more damage than good and that he depends on let's plays and gaming videos to spread and popularise his music by word of mouth.

The warehouse was built in 1926 and was listed in the Danish national registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 4 April 2006. The warehouse is situated on the water front of the Port of Aarhus in the central Indre by neighbourhood next to the Custom House and has functioned as a storehouse for parcels and other small cargo since completion to the mid 20th century. The building is today used for offices after extensive renovation in 2007. The protected status was given due to the detailed work in an industrial structure. The Heritage Agency emphasizes the large gates and wall areas that give the building gravitas, offset by the small grid windows, gate covers and the copper roof. The interior features large mushroom columns typical of industrial architecture and they give the long store rooms a basilical appearance. The warehouse illustrates the importance of the Port of Aarhus as the largest provincial port in Denmark in the 20th century. The building is 43 meters long in two stories and constructed of red bricks. The longer sides facing the harbor and Havnegade are not identical but are designed for a common purpose with large gates and grid windows. The doors are made of teak and painted red with intricate carvings and framed by granite blocks. The low hip roof is plated in verdigris green copper plates. The neoclassical architecture interacts with the characteristic national romantic Custom House building from 1898 situated next to it. The warehouse was designed by the royal building inspector Frederik M. Draiby who also designed the Spanien Public Baths. It was slightly altered in 1963 with the addition of a gate in the north wall and a ramp. In 2007 it was renovated and turned into offices after it was listed as a protected building.

Until it merged with Practical Action publishing, HBI was registered with the Charity Commission and also with Companies House in the UK.\\"Companies House\\" In January 2017 the charity changed its name from TALC to Health Books International. Vision and history Ht / wt chart supplied by TALC in use in Madagascar, 1986 Teaching- aids at Low Cost was formed by Professor Morley CBE, MD, FRCP when he was lecturer at the Institute of Child Health, London. He really did change the world, by transforming the approach to childhood illness in resource-poor, tropical countries. He also responded to many requests from overseas students for teaching equipment to use in their own countries in an innovative way. His vision was to provide books about health and also teaching materials cheaply to healthcare workers and others in low income settings. Originally TALC compiled 35mm slide sets with accompanying notes that clinical teachers could use to illustrate their lectures, showing, for example, what a measles or smallpox rash looks like.South Sudan Medical Journal piece, 2008 TALC also supplied (and as HBI continues to supply) other materials. These included special spoons for measuring out the correct proportions of sugar and salt to be given to children as life-saving oral rehydration drinks, as well as simple means of assessing malnutrition. In the early days much of the work of packing up materials and posting them abroad was done by volunteers based in Saint Albans, Hertfordshire. The charity has always fostered good relationships between practising clinicians working both in the South and in industrialised nations. Expatriates who have experience of working in low income settings ensure that supplies are arranged according to need and utility. One simple example of this is the mid upper arm circumference tapes that are used for rapid diagnosis of malnutrition. These are now plasticised to give them longer lives in harsh situations. Current work In 2017 the charity moved its base back to St. Albans having been in Harpenden, Hertfordshire for some years. With the stampede towards electronic publications and the difficulty of distributing heavy items, many ‚Äúexperts‚Äù stated that the days of transporting books to the tropics were long gone.University at Buffalo Libraries program However it is clear that there is still a role for a niche book distributor of practical guides about clinical medicine, health training materials and information on environmental sanitation for use in low income, non- industrialised countries.Elsevier BookaidAmerican Medical Students Assoc. advocacy network Materials deemed by some as outdated including flannelgraphs and laminated charts and posters suitable for illiterate target audiences are still in great demand. HBI continues to distribute these at minimal cost, as well as oral rehydration spoons and mid-upper arm circumference malnutrition assessment tapes. According to the Chair's Report of 2015, over the course of its 50-year history TALC/HBI has sent over 10 million books, photographic slides and accessories to thousands of healthcare workers in low-income countries and fragile states.

Issue one starred the title character Venus, and was made up of three stories, two written by Stan Lee and penciled by George Klein and Ken Bald and a third was a one-page Hey Look! filler written and drawn by Harvey Kurtzman. Issue six saw the first Marvel Comics appearance of the god Loki, here acting as a villainous foil to Venus.Schoell (2014), p. 52 From issue 10 the title took on a science fiction slant, and included stories by Russ Heath and Joe Maneely. By issue 11 the comic added the slogan \\"Strange Stories of the Supernatural\\" and though the tales still included Venus and other supporting characters, the comic began to morph into a horror/sci-fi anthology. In issue 12 Loki is joined by Thor to rescue Venus from the clutches of the evil sultan Khorak,Schoell (2014), p. 53 though this version of Thor is not recognized as a first appearance.

Nayanar, Chief Minister of Kerala, launched the CD-ROM project of Invis Multimedia. The history of digital media in Kerala starts with the launching of the project Kerala: The Green Symphony in November 1996. The CD- ROM, Kerala: The Green Symphony was the first cross platform (Windows/Macintosh) CD-ROM developed in India. The final product was released on 18 June 1998. Subsequently, the Department of Tourism, Government of Kerala agreed to sponsor the title Kerala: The Green Symphony and it was released as a multimedia title, produced in association with Kerala Tourism. The CD-ROM was later translated into Hindi, German, French and Japanese languages. Invis-Directors N.S. Lal , N R S Babu , M.R.Hari , M R Ajith In 1998, Invis Multimedia was appointed as the ICT Solution Provider of Kerala Tourism. They developed the portal www.keralatourism.org for the Department of Tourism, Government of Kerala. In 2000, Invis Multimedia envisaged a plan to geotag all the major institutions and destinations of Kerala on a map to be developed with geographical information system. This was four years before the birth of Google Earth. The project had to be aborted due to delays in getting clearance for using satellite images and, with the introduction of Google Earth, all the services envisaged in the proposed plan became freely available. However, Invis developed a GIS map for Kerala Tourism in 2003, proving that they were years ahead of their time. In 2001, Invis launched a CD- ROM on Ayurveda, the ancient health science of India. The CD was launched by Atal Bihari Vajpayee, the Prime Minister of India. It was translated into French and German languages. The title won a number of prestigious national and international awards. In 2002, Invis Multimedia became a member of UNESCO‚Äôs Global Alliance for Cultural Diversity. In 2003, it started publishing music CD titles.

She was the first African-American artist to exhibit paintings in California in 1890. Powell was also a pianist who gave recitals around the San Francisco Bay Area. Family history Pauline Powell was born in 1872 in Oakland, California, to Josephine Turner and her husband, train porter William W. Powell. Her great-grandfather was blacksmith Joseph Fossett, one of Thomas Jefferson's slaves who was freed by the terms of his will in 1826. Her grandmother Isabella Fossett was also a slave and as a child was sold away from Monticello in 1827 as part of a settlement of estate debts, later escaping to Boston. Powell's parents moved to Oakland, where their daughter Pauline was born in 1872, the year her grandmother Isabella died. On October 11, 1893, she married Edward E. Burns; they had no children. Career Powell showed early musical and artistic talent and studied both piano and painting. Although African-Americans were by then being admitted to the California School of Design, she appears to have been largely self-taught. She gave public piano recitals locally and at least once sang in a quartet in Los Angeles; she was praised by a Bay Area writer as ‚Äúthe bright musical star of her state.‚Äù Powell is believed to have been the first African-American artist to exhibit anywhere in California. She apparently began showing her paintings at the age of 14, but her first known public exhibition was at the Mechanics' Institute Fair in San Francisco in 1890. Although her paintings at the fair received \\"great praise,\\" she was then better recognized as a pianist and is listed in a 1919 history of African-Americans in California solely as a piano teacher. Powell‚Äôs artwork is scarce, partly because of when she lived but also because she died at a young age. She died at the age of 40 in 1912, of tuberculosis. She is known to have painted landscapes and still lifes; surviving works include Champagne and Oysters (ca. 1890), Bulldogs, Still Life With Fruit (1890), Violets (oil on card, 1890), and a pair of watercolors, one of nasturtiums and the other of tulips, both of which are in the collection of Dunsmuir House in Oakland, California. Violets is in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African American History and Culture.

The film has an unaccredited narration by broadcaster Lorne Greene.  Synopsis  During the Second World War, the importance of Allied strategic bombing of military targets meant that heavy bombers had to be available. The Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) was a British wartime civilian organization, headquartered at White Waltham Airfield, Berkshire, England that ferried new, repaired and damaged military aircraft between factories, assembly plants, transatlantic delivery points, Maintenance Units (MUs), scrap yards to active service squadrons and airfields. The Royal Air Force (RAF) also created a special unit, the RAF Ferry Command, to meet the needs of delivering aircraft from aircraft factories in North America to RAF operational squadrons in a timely manner. Across the Atlantic, aircraft factories in Canada, acting as shadow factories for the British war effort, also relied on ferry pilots to deliver aircraft over the long transatlantic route to the United Kingdom. Along with RAF personnel, former bush pilots and commercial aviators formed the basis of the pool of ferry pilots that flew from Canada. Ferry missions as regular as five times a month, set out from bases such as Dorval Airport in Montreal and Gander Airport, Gander, Newfoundland as part of the \\"air bridge\\" to Europe.

Her paintings are usually themed on stories and positions which are under- represented in both mainstream and contemporary art culture. Her preferred medium is water color on silk, and she has also worked in other media, including oil on canvas. Her paintings are in several major collections in India & abroad. Her works has been hugely inspired by her formative years in Kolkata and her deep belief in spirituality. Originally from Kolkata she lives & works in Gurgaon, Haryana  Early life and education  Uma Bardhan started her work in early 20s, completed her Bachelor of Arts, from University of Calcutta followed by Diploma in fine arts from Birla Academy of Art and Culture, West Bengal under the tutelage of eminent artists like Makhan Dutta Gupta in oil color and Maniklal Banerjee in water colour. She was always inclined towards art from her childhood. She used to like poems of Rabindranath Tagore very much & used to draw sketches by reading & visualising his poems in her mind.  Art career  The concern and contemplation on multiple aspects related to Mother Nature get expressed by works of Artist Uma Bardhan. She weaves her protagonists, Hindu God and Goddess, women, birds and other natural elements into visual thoughts, into strokes of spirituality as one breathe in the colors, flow with the textures and soak in the spirit of mother nature. Being spiritual at heart Hindu God & Goddess always remains as part of her theme. Uma Bardhan did her first solo art show in 1987, followed by numerous solo shows across decade.

Her interest in the subject & spirituality took her to countless Shiva temples across India. In another exhibition at the Academy of Fine Arts, Bardhan portrays the predominance of artificial environment prevalent in present-day city life as a contrast to the pristine beauty of nature in rural life.

A painstaking process where a special silk cloth is mounted on board before it can be used for painting. The reason it's not so popular might be due to the fact that it is a relatively painstaking process where a special silk cloth is mounted on board before being used as a painting. The silk cloth is arranged from Murshidabad district of West Bengal, famously known as murshidabad silk, and at first washed silk cloth by hand or in the washing machine on a gentle cycle with warm water. followed by mounting on paper board with adhesive. As water colors would tend to bleed/run more than the other paints it is required to keep the paints fairly thick without too much water added in. She applies adhesive over the mounted silk cloth to hold the water color otherwise it will spread & leave it for 2 to 3 hours for drying. The amount of adhesive to be applied over the silk cloth is tricky as one have to be very careful as two much adhesive might not be good.

Childhood and early life  Mazzetti was born in Florence. Her mother, Olga Liberati, died shortly after giving birth to Lorenza and her twin sister Paola. Her father, Corrado Mazzetti, gave custody of his children to a nurse in the village Anticoli Corrado, where they spent the first three years of their life. When Corrado Mazzetti realised that the nurse was taking advantage of his absence and leaving the children alone while he was out at work, his friend Ugo Giannattasio, a futurist painter, offered to temporarily take care of them. Mazzetti and her sister eventually moved in with their paternal aunt, Cesarina (Nina) Mazzetti, in a farm in Rignano sull‚ÄôArno, where she lived with her husband Robert Einstein (cousin of Albert) and their two daughters Anna Maria and Luce. Here Lorenza and Paola became part of the family and lived happy and untroubled. During the Second World War, the farm was occupied by a department of the Wehrmacht. With the advancement of Anglo-American forces, after the last motor truck had just left, three German officers stepped into the villa and asked for Robert. Nina answered that he was not at home. The officers announced that they would return shortly. Assuming that the only person in danger would be her husband, Nina begged him to hide in the woods. However, when the officers returned on 3 August 1944 and did not find Robert, they assassinated his family. This incident is known as the Strage di Rignano. Lorenza and Paola were able to escape the massacre because their surname wasn't Einstein. However, their lives had become tainted forever by the execution of their aunt and their cousins. After the carnage, they were carried away, along with a group of farmers who had been hiding in the basement seeking shelter from the bombing of the English army. The farm was set on fire. Robert, who had hidden in the woods, was overwhelmed by pain and committed suicide on 13 July 1945. Lorenza and Paola were entrusted to a custodian that their uncle had authorised with the administration of his estate that he had passed on to them.  Life in London in the 1950s. The films K and Together  After obtaining her high school diploma, and determined to bury the terrible memory in her subconscious, Lorenza moved to London. There she received a message from her sister Paola that their custodian had squandered their whole wealth and had left the sisters penniless. In order to be able to stay in London, Lorenza took a job as a waitress in an eatery at Charing Cross. She could not afford to pay her rent, but thanks to the sympathy of the director William Coldstream, who was impressed by her tenacity, she was accepted into the Slade School of Fine Art. Between 1952 and 1953, Mazzetti worked on her first film, K. The (unacknowledged) participation in the early stages by fellow Slade student Andrew Vicari has been described by a then friend of both.Mills, John, Which Yet Survive. Impressions of Friends, Family and Encounters, Quartet Books, London, 2017 The topic of the film deals with the story of Franz Kafka‚Äôs Metamorphosis and is interpreted by the painter Michael Andrews. The film is considered to have anticipated the future Free Cinema, which in 1956 would be written down and signed by Mazzetti, Lindsay Anderson, Tony Richardson and Karel Reisz. K is a strongly biographically-stamped story dealing with the theme of alienation. The sound track was produced by Daniele Paris, who also worked with Mazzetti and Anderson in their later projects. To develop the film reels and to obtain a copy of her film, Lorenza was prepared to make a false statement and risk prison time. Fortunately she was saved by Coldstream, who was convinced by her talent and organised a showing of the film at the Slade School. He invited Denis Forman, the director of the British Film Institute. At the end of the performance, Forman asked Mazzetti: ‚ÄòWould you like to make a film without running the risk of going to prison?‚Äô He invited her to partake in a new film project, which was to be financed by the BFI Experimental Film Fund. The result was the film Together. Together features the sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi and Michael Andrews as two deaf-mutes in the East End of London and was produced by the same film crew as K. Together was also written by Denis Horne, but he left the production because of a disagreement with the director, who did not want to incorporate his long dialogs in the recording. The montage works, guided by Mazzetti, were finished thanks to an intervention by Anderson. He called on Daniele Paris from Rome to write and direct the sound track. Together won the \\"Mention au film de recherche\\" on the Festival di Cannes 1956, along with the Brassa√Ø film Tant qu'il y aura des b√™tes. In her book Diario Londinese, published by Sellerio in 2014, Mazzetti described the audacious adventures of this time. The was published in English as London Diaries in 2019.  Return to Italy and success of Il cielo cade (The Sky Falls)  After leaving London in order to collect her film prize in Cannes, Mazzetti returned to Italy for a while. She wished to see her twin sister, who in the meantime had given birth to a daughter. However back in Italy she became haunted by the tragic murder of her adopted family and fell into a deep depression, leading her to stay longer than originally planned. After a long phase of treatment, and thanks to the psychotherapist Barrie Simmons, she managed to excavate the suppressed and to reclaim parts of the tender, magical memories of her childhood‚Äîeven if accompanied by a lot of pain. This is how she began to work on her book Il cielo cade. The manuscript was rejected by several editors until Mazzetti sent it to Cesare Zavattini. He reacted with enthusiasm and presented it to Attilio Bertolucci, publisher of Garzanti. Bertolucci declared the book a little masterpiece: he published and sent the work to the Premio Viareggio, where in 1962 Il cielo cade won first prize. Il cielo cade is written in a narrative style of a child and from a child's perspective with the war described from the view point of a child, that is in love with Gesu‚Äô, the Duce and with its adoptive uncle. It is a tragic but also a comical book. Worried that the tone of her story could offend the memory of the Einstein family, Mazzetti changed the names of the protagonists. Federico Fellini compared the novel with Il giornalino di Gian Burrasca, while Henri Michaux calls it \\"un petit livre f√©roce\\". When Garzanti's rights to the text expired, Il cielo cade was republished by Elvira Sellerio. Mazzetti confessed to the publisher that rather than a novel, the book was more her own biography. As a result of this, Elvira Sellerio asked her to dedicate the book to the Einstein family and add a photo of Nina and Robert Einstein. The novel, now published by Sellerio, is considered a classic of contemporary Italian literature. In 2000, Il cielo cade was filmed under the same title by brothers Andrea Frazzi and Antonio Frazzi. It was staged by Suso Cecchi D‚ÄôAmico and acted out by Isabella Rossellini. In the same year the film won the prize for the best film of the Giffoni Film Festival. The following novel Con rabbia (Rage) was published in 1963 by Garzanti: \\"Penny hates not only the Germans, who have murdered her family but all hypocritical philistines, who make themselves guilty each day again\\".  Life in Rome. Puppet Theatre and other publications. In the Sixties Lorenza met Bruno Grieco, a journalist, writer and son of Ruggero Grieco, who‚Äîtogether with Bordiga, Gramsci and Terracini‚Äîfounded the Partito Comunista Italiano. Grieco was prompted by Cesare Zavattini to accompany Lorenza to the international exhibition of the \\"Cinema libero di Porretta Terme\\". Together with Giampaolo Testa and Leonida Repaci, the creatives were determined to win the prize for the best film there. Lorenza and Grieco began what was to be a long relationship. Their shared apartment on Via Vittoria, Rome, was frequented by many artists and intellectuals. Besides the protagonists of the Free Cinema (Lindsay Anderson, Reisz, Richardson, Richard Harris and Tom Courtenay), there were also Daisy Lumini, Marguerite Duras, Max Frisch, Malcolm McDowell, Rod Steiger and Claire Bloom, Guillaume Chpaltine, Serge Reggiani, Agn√®s Varda, Anouk Aim√©e, Achille Perilli, Piero Dorazio, Renzo Vespignani, Francesco Trombadori and, amongst others, Gian Maria Volont√©, who played endless ping-pong matches with Giovanni Berlinguer. When Cesare Zavattini commissioned a team of young directors to produce the episode film Le italiane e l‚Äôamore (1961), he entrusted Lorenza Mazzetti with an episode that dealt with children. She accepted, but after the shooting decided to leave the film world because the \\"cinema verita‚Äô\\" did not interest her. Thanks to her prizes and the public recognition that Lorenza Mazzetti had gained in the meantime, she was offered a collaboration with the magazine Vie Nuove (where Pier Paolo Pasolini was also writing at the time) by the Partito Comunista. Lorenza wrote a weekly column for the magazine, in which she invited the reader to tell her their dreams. She then interpreted these dreams together with Jungian psychoanalyst Vincenzo Loriga. Through this, the concept of the subconscious was introduced to the world of the workers for the first time. Unfortunately, this venture was judged as too risky by the communist party‚Äîmeaning that Lorenza had to renounce any hope of working with Italian broadcasting station Rai, even though a minor collaboration had already started there. The articles of Lorenza Mazzetti in Vie Nuove are collected in the volume \\"Il lato oscuro. L‚Äôinconscio degli italiani\\", published by Tindalo in 1969. In the same year her novel \\"Uccidi il padre e la madre\\" (Kill Your Mother and Father) was released. It is an existentialist novel, telling the story of a young revolutionary woman who does not succeed in getting out of a station that she entered in order to depart from there. Later, in the surroundings of the Campo de‚Äô Fiori, Lorenza started the \\"Puppet Theatre\\", a marionette theatre for children. This brought famous English marionettes Pulcinella and his wife Punch e Judy to Rome. In 1974 Lorenza met Luigi Galletti, a partisan of the Gruppi di Azione Patriottica of Giovanni Pesce. He was dressed up as the marshall Harold Alexander. The pair later married. He was a fascinating and humorous man, and an esteemed doctor. Lorenza pulled him into the work of the puppet theatre, where he performed the voices of the king, the giant and the wolf. At the same time Mazzetti dedicated herself to interpreting children's dreams and to putting them on stage in schools. The experiment was financed by Franco Enriquez, the director of the \\"Teatro di Roma\\". The results of the laboratories were published by Guaraldi in the volume of the year 1975 \\"Il teatro dell‚Äôio: l‚Äôonirodramma. I bambini drammatizzano a scuola i loro sogni\\".  Paintings, restoration of K and its distribution  Recently, Mazzetti has developed a notable career as a painter, which culminated in two exhibitions: ‚ÄúThe Album di famiglia‚Äù with 80 paintings illustrating the events described in the novel Il Cielo cade: and ‚ÄúA proposito del Free Cinema‚Äù where she created portraits of key figures of English cinema during the 50s and 60s. The exhibition was shown in several cities: in Rome, in the Complesso San Michele, the seat of the \\"Beni Culturali\\", where it was visited over three months by schoolchildren; in Florence, in the Palazzo Medici; in Porretta Terme (BO), and in Mantova and in Dresden, where it had been co-organised by the Italian Consulate together with the Jewish Community and the University Dresden. K, which had been jealously guarded by its author, was reconstructed only in 2010 by the Assoziation Cinit Cineforum Italiano. Thanks to Marco Duse und Marco Vanelli, the film was transferred to DVD and got attached to the number 168 of the magazine Cabiria Studi di cinema. It has been shown in London, Venice, Florence, Bologna and Rome and is to be shown in many other cities along with Together. In a certain way, all the books of Mazzetti can be seen as a continuation of Il cielo cade. Furthermore, Diario Londinese is a kind of ‚Äòprequel‚Äô in which Mazzetti describes the upcoming of the Free Cinema and also the Angry Young Men. The stream of consciousness is a suppression of the past that caused all of Mazzetti's undertakings, and probably also the cause of all her successes. Diario Londinese was presented for the first time in Rome by the \\"Casa del Cinema di Roma\\", by Irene Bignardi and Antonio Gnoli. It was Mazzetti's main objective to show the film Il cielo cade in schools. She wanted to talk with young people in order to keep the memory of the Holocaust alive, by the example of the tragedy of the Einstein family, a massacre that would have been kept a secret if not for her book. On 4 January 2020, Mazzetti died in Rome at age 92.  In popular culture  In the 2020 novel, Summer by writer Ali Smith, Mazzetti plays a cameo, but significant role. Her life story, as well as reference to her early films, are included.

Since 1994, she has been the principal flautist of the Danish National Symphony Orchestra. In 2006, she was nominated for a Grammy Award in the category Best Soloist Performance with Orchestra. Biography Miilmann was brought up in Vemmedrup near K√∏ge in the south of Zealand. Her interest in the flute started at the age of eight when she the saw instrument being played on a television programme. Two years later, her parents gave her a flute for her birthday. When they saw how interested she had become in playing it, they arranged for her to have music lessons in Hiller√∏d, driving her there every Saturday. Her parents' interest in her progress encouraged her, motivating her to practice for several hours a day. She progressed quickly, winning the Berlingske Music Competition in 1988 and playing as a soloist with the Copenhagen Philharmonic in 1990. In the 1980s, it became fashionable for teenagers to go to America as exchange students. Miilmann received a place at the School of the Arts in North Carolina. She quickly adapted to the school's intensive curriculum, practising every day from 5 a.m., then following classes until late in the afternoon. She remained at the school until she was 20, successfully completing her education with a bachelor's degree in 1992. The years she had spent there had however been quite a strain. As a result, when she returned to Denmark at the age of 20, she took on a job as a postman. But when she saw an advertisement for a post with the Royal Danish Orchestra, she immediately started to practise again, gaining admission when she was just 21. The following year, she became solo flautist with the Danish National Symphony Orchestra attached to Danmarks Radio, a position she still holds today. Miilmann also plays in the Danish Radio Woodwind Quintet which she helped to establish in 1999. She has appeared as a soloist with all the major orchestras in Copenhagen and has played with other notable soloists including the pianist Katrine Gislinge and the violinist Gidon Kremer. In 2002, she appeared with the Philharmonia Moment Musical at a Danish music event in Taipei. In February 2006, Miilmann received a Grammy nomination for \\"Best Soloist Performance with Orchestra\\" for her recording of Ole Schmidt's Concerto for Flute and Orchestra. Although she did not win the award, the nomination and her treatment at the event in Los Angeles encouraged her to stick to playing the flute at a time when she had been considering moving into another profession. In January 2014, Miilmann was the soloist in Carl Nielsen's Flute Concerto which she first played when she was about 13 years old. \\"It's only over the past four or five years that I have really begun to understand it...

Shiera Sanders Hall was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Dennis Neville, and first appeared in Flash Comics #1 (January 1940) as a romantic interest of Hawkman (Carter Hall). Then later as one of DC's earliest super-heroines, she has appeared in many of the company's flagship team-up titles including the Justice Society of America. Publication history Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Dennis Neville, Shiera Sanders first appeared in Flash Comics #1 (January 1940), in the same 12-page story in which Fox and Neville introduced Hawkman.Flash Comics #1 at the Grand Comics Database Archaeologist Carter Hall has a dream that he is an ancient Egyptian prince, Khufu, who has a lover, named Shiera in the original story, or Princess Chay-Ara in modern retellings. The next day, Carter meets a woman named Shiera, who looks exactly like the woman in his dream. Carter dons the identity of Hawkman and Shiera becomes Carter's girlfriend. Shiera first appears as Hawkgirl in All Star Comics #5 (July 1941), in a costume created by Sheldon Moldoff,Hawkgirl at the Grand Comics Database based on Neville's Hawkman costume. During Hawkman's solo segment of the Justice Society of America story, Shiera dons a spare set of Nth metal wings developed by Hawkman, and masquerades as Hawkman in order to trick some criminals. Shiera continues to wear the costume and wings in later stories, eventually adopting the identity of Hawkgirl. With the establishment of DC's multiverse system, the Golden Age Hawkgirl was said to have lived on Earth-Two and the Silver Age Hawkgirl on Earth-One. Although Golden Age Hawkman makes his first Silver Age appearance during the first JLA/JSA team-ups in 1963 and continues making appearances during the annual JLA/JSA team-ups, Golden Age Hawkgirl does not reappear until 1976, in the revival of the All Star Comics monthly comic. During the publication gap between the cancellation of Hawkman at the end of the Golden Age and the reintroduction of Earth-Two Hawkman during the Silver Age, Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl are married off-panel. Golden Age Hawkgirl made further appearances as the mother of Silver Scarab in the Infinity Inc. comic and as Hawkgirl as a member of the All-Star Squadron, a retroactive team of Golden Age heroes active in the 1940s. =Post-Crisis and One Year Later= Following the events of DC's miniseries, Crisis on Infinite Earths, the histories of Earth-One, Two, Four, S, and X were merged into one single Earth with a consistent past, present, and future. As a result, both the Golden Age and the Silver Age versions of Hawkman and Hawkgirl live on the same Earth. Shortly after Crisis on Infinite Earths, DC decided that having the Justice Society on the same Earth as all of the other superheroes was redundant and most of the team, including Golden Age Hawkman and Hawkgirl were given a sendoff in the Last Days of the Justice Society one-shot. The Justice Society were trapped in another dimension, Limbo, where they would battle for all of eternity to prevent Ragnar√∂k from occurring on the Earth. Shiera were resurrected after Blackest Night. Fictional character biography Hawkgirl (Shiera Hall). Art by Ivan Reis. The reincarnation of the Egyptian princess Chay-Ara, and partner of Carter Hall, the Golden Age Hawkman. Centuries ago, Chay-Ara and her lover Prince Khufu were killed by Hath-Set with a knife forged from Nth metal. The properties of the metal and the strength of the duo's love created a bond between them, causing them to be reborn multiple times throughout the centuries. Some of her incarnations are: * Lady Celia Penbrook, alive during 5th century Britain, and love of Silent Knight * Cinnamon (also known as Kate Manser), an Old West gunslinger, and love of Nighthawk * Sheila Carr, lady love of Pinkerton detective James Wright In the early 20th century, Chay-Ara was reborn as Shiera Sanders. She was kidnapped by Dr. Anton Hastor (reincarnation of Hath-Set), but subsequently rescued by Hawkman (her reborn lover Khufu). Shiera became the hero's frequent ally and love interest. Eventually, she was granted a costume of her own and a belt of gravity-defying Nth metal, and joined him at his side as Hawkgirl. The Hawks were members of the All-Star Squadron, and while Hawkman was a member of the Justice Society of America, Hawkgirl was not, only assisting the group on occasion. Following the events of DC's miniseries, Crisis on Infinite Earths, Shiera Hall joined the JSA. Eventually, Carter and Shiera married and had one son, Hector Hall, the previous Doctor Fate. Through retcon, Carter and Shiera also joined the Justice League of America in the late 1980s, serving as liaisons between that group and the Justice Society. Shiera died when she was merged with Carter and Katar Hol to form a new Hawkman version, a \\"hawk god\\" creature, during the events of Zero Hour, but was revived during the events of Blackest Night by the White Lantern ring. Powers and abilitiesOther versions=DC Bombshells= In the DC Bombshells continuity set in World War II, Shiera is a technological genius and archaeologist who aids the Bombshells with her lover, Vixen. As Hawkgirl, she uses a jetpack rather than fly with wings, though when Cheetah forces her to build weapons out of ancient technology, she designs one with wings as well as a powerful mace. Shiera grew up in an orphanage in Mexico. From a young age she had a passion for history and ancient cultures, as well as the magnificent structures that they built. She became an archaeologist and her work caught the eye of Hans Garber. He informed her of the Zambesi Amulets and the power that they possessed.http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Shiera_(DC_Bombshells) Intrigued, Shiera goes to Zambesi to try to discover the secret of the amulets. There she met Queen Mari of Zambesi and the two of them fell in love. Shiera stayed in Zambesi with Mari and became her personal mechanic, building gadgets to assist Mari against her enemies. Hawkgirl discovers her true Thanagarian origins while fighting against Baroness Paula von Gunther. After connecting herself with an ancient mechanic god it's revealed to Shiera that her parents were members of the Wingmen of Thanagar, they sought to warn the humans upon the intentions of Thanagar who wished to conquer the Earth; due to their actions they were captured and murdered.DC Bombshells #24 (June 2017) =Injustice: Gods Among Us= In the comic book adaptation of Injustice: Gods Among Us, Hawkgirl (Shiera Hall) appears as a member of Superman's Regime. She first appears to answer Wonder Woman's call for heroes at the Watchtower. After being informed of the situation, the kidnapping of Superman's parents at the hands of Mirror Master, she is one of the many heroes to agree to help locate the Rogue. She battles Weather Wizard in Central City, and is later seen waiting outside the villain's bar. Hawkgirl next appears to help Wonder Woman battle the attacking Atlanteans and Aquaman. Hawkgirl battles the forces of Atlantis as Wonder Woman orders her to rescue the people who had been knocked off the boat by Aquaman's attack. She watches Arthur's forces suddenly retreat and notices the massive tsunami fast approaching. She is the first to realize there is something behind the wave. Hawkgirl spots what she believes are mountains rising out of the water, but are in fact the massive tentacles of the Kraken Aquaman called to his aid. Hawkgirl is ensnared by one of the Kraken's tentacles and dragged underwater, slowly drowning while Wonder Woman struggles to save her. After Superman arrives and forces Aquaman to call his beast off, Hawkgirl is ordered by the Man of Steel to help the sailors while Superman and the League go to give their response to Aquaman's ultimatum. Hawkgirl removes the leader of a country from his limousine during a parade before she loses him to Captain Atom. Shocked, Shiera lets her guard down and is struck by a blast of electricity, causing her to fall to the streets below. Collapsed, Hawkgirl sees Black Lightning and Huntress before the latter knocks her unconscious with an arrow bolt. Hawkgirl is later seen being held in a cell in the Batcave, glaring at Batman and Catwoman as they discuss the League's reaction to her kidnapping. When Catwoman points out the League will be searching for her, Batman disagrees and the scene cuts to the Watchtower, where to many heroes shock, a second Hawkgirl is seen arriving. The true Hawkgirl has remained trapped within the Batcave while her imposter has been revealed as the Martian Manhunter, shape-shifted into her form. Exactly a week later, the Martian Manhunter is exposed thanks to Batman's son Damian, and Bruce releases Hawkgirl as promised. Shiera makes her way to the crashed Watchtower and confirms her identity by easily putting out a lit match. Hawkgirl goes to the Hall of Justice to question Lex Luthor over whether Sinestro truly willingly gave up his ring and powers before allowing himself to be imprisoned. Luthor confirms her questions before saying he still believes Sinestro has something else to play before Sinestro responds that the Green Lanterns will soon arrive to capture Superman and that the League will need his help to stop them. Hawkgirl is next seen waiting for Superman and Shazam in Utah at the Great Salt desert, mace at the ready as she answers Shazam's question of what the Man of Steel thinks they're dealing with by replying \\"He thinks we're dealing with Green Lanterns.\\" When Superman asks how she knows, she tells him she was talking with their 'guest' at the Hall of Justice. When she sees Superman staring up into the sky, she asks how many Lanterns are on the way, with Superman replying, \\"Too many.\\" After the Green Lanterns arrive in front of them and Superman and Kilowog have a brief conversation, Shiera demands to know where Hal Jordan is, and when Kilowog doesn't respond, Superman has Cyborg fire a beam down on the Green Lanterns from the Watchtower. The Green Lanterns survive and engage the three, with Hawkgirl fighting the Green Lanterns Isamot Kol and RRU-9-2, when she sees Superman suddenly go down, calling out his name. Shortly after, Hawkgirl is defeated, her Nth Metal mace taken by Green Lantern Tomar-Re, and her unconscious body trapped in a bubble construct alongside Shazam. Before any of them can be taken to Oa, Sinestro arrives, killing Ch'p. Shiera is freed and recovers her mace before engaging Tomar-Re and Procanon Kaa in a battle until the arrival of the Sinestro Corps. Hawkgirl flies above the captured Green Lanterns, silently observing as they remove their rings in surrender and she witnesses the Sinestro Corps depart the Earth on Sinestro's orders. During the lost seven months, Hawkgirl worked alongside fellow League members Superman and Shazam as well as Lanterns Hal, John and Sinestro in toppling more 'rogue nations' to continue establishing peace across the world. When Hawkman returns to Thanagar and does not find Hawkgirl he goes to Earth. There he tries to force Hawkgirl to leave Superman's Regime and return home, but, loyal to Superman, Shiera fights against Hawkman; after defeating him she asks him to leave or she will kill him. Not respecting her wish, Hawkman later returns to Earth and tries to kill Superman with a kryptonite mace; he fails and is killed in a fist fight against Superman. =Bombshells: United= Hawkgirl appears as Shiera Hall in the continuation series to DC Comics Bombshells, Bombshells: United set in the United States in 1943.

The park has a representative lowland river environment, with a slow current. The lakes and swamps are mainly concentrated in the floodplain of the Alatyr River. Marshes are mainly lowland. A few bogs are located in the southern and central parts of the park, and there are many springs. The park was created to protect the deciduous forest and representative wetlands of Mordovia. The habitat also creates a refuge for birds of international importance. It is situated in the Ichalkovsky District and Bolsheignatovsky District of the Republic. Topography Geographically, the park is in the northwest corner of the Volga Uplands. The territory is relatively flat or slightly hilly, with a network of ravines in the northern sectors that even out towards the south. The territory is roughly rectangular, 35 km west-east, and 20 km north-south; one road runs north-south through the middle. Elevations range from 93 meters to 217 meters. The Alatyr river floodplain runs along the southern edge of the park. There are approximately 80 small streams on the grounds, and 185 km of ephemeral streams and waterways. Bogs are distributed across the Alatyr floodplain and its tributaries. There are 157 hectares of swamps in the park. Ecoregion and Climate Smolny lies in the East European forest steppe ecoregion (WWF ID#419), a transition zone between the broadleaf forests of the north and the grasslands to the south, cutting across the middle of Eastern Europe from Bulgaria through Russia. This forest steppe ecoregion is characterized by a mosaic of forests, steppe, and riverine wetlands. The climate in Smolny is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. The coldest month is January (-11 C on average); the warmest month is July (+19 C). Average precipitation is 440 ‚Äì 550 mm. The frost-free period is 125‚Äì149 days. The predominant winds are from the southwest. Flora The floodplain of the meandering Alatyr forms a wetland environment with the biological properties of a eutrophic (Greek: \\"well-nourished\\") lake - with rich vegetation, shallow and warm. Overall, forests dominate 95% of the territory. Coniferous forest (about 40% of the land) are predominantly pine and spruce. In the south the forests are mostly pine forests on the terraces above the floodplain. In the north are broad-leaf oak, linden, maple and ash forests. About 12% of the park is secondary forest. In the meadow areas the grasses include Kentucky bluegrass, fescue and foxtail. The park has recorded over 200 species of mushrooms, 100 species of mosses, and 750 species of vascular plants. Fauna The fish of the rivers and lakes include common pike, dace, chub, gudgeon, loach, eel, perch, and silver carp. The mammals are those typical of forest-steppe forests: elk, wild boar, fox, marten, weasels, and various mice and voles. Tourism The park is accessible by bus to the village of Smolny on the edge of the park. The grounds have furnished recreational areas with picnic pavilions, areas for swimming, and areas for collecting mushrooms and berries. There is a museum on the site of the ecology and natural history of the region in Mordovia.

Founded in 2012, the club competed three times in the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League until the league split in 2016. Their best result came in their debut season, 2013, when they finished as runners-up behind Hekari United, losing 3‚Äì0 in the Grand Final. History In late 2012, it was reported that a club with the name of Port Moresby City FC had registered interest in the upcoming 2013 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League, but had as yet failed to pay the affiliation fee. However, on 6 January 2013, it was confirmed that the side, now operating under the name of Football Club Port Moresby, were officially registered as a debuting team ahead of the new season. Under coach Reggie Davani, the side made a slow start to life in the division, losing their opening match 2‚Äì0 against reigning champions Hekari United before going down the following weekend to Gigira Laitepo Morobe. However, a 3‚Äì0 victory over Eastern Stars, who had finished as runners-up in the two previous seasons, set a precedent, and the side would go unbeaten for the remainder of the season, aside from a match awarded against them in mid-March for failing to show. After striker Niel Hans scored five goals in a 7‚Äì0 thrashing of WNB Tavur in their final regular season match, the side went into the playoffs in fine form, having finished third in the table. Indeed, they managed to get past second-placed Besta PNG United in the semi- final after a 2‚Äì0 victory, despite a strong start from the development side. However, they would eventually fall 3‚Äì0 at the hands of Hekari in the Grand Final. Ahead of the 2014 season, the club expressed an interest in renewing their participation, but by October had failed to pay their affiliation fee. On 13 December, it was revealed that the club had been axed from the competition by the National Soccer League board, an action which was appealed by the club, forcing a court order. This court order led to a delay in the start of the season as a stalemate developed between the club and the organising body, despite Port Moresby chairman Richard Kassman insisting that the court case was not preventing the football season from kicking off. The deadlock was broken in early February 2014, when FC Port Moresby withdrew their court case. After a season-long hiatus, the club returned ahead of the 2015 season. Again, the side only lost three games across the regular season, to Oro FC, Madang FC and Admiralty FC, while managing to beat Hekari United 1‚Äì0 after the eight-time champions had already secured the Minor Premiership. However, the side would only finish 4th after losing 3‚Äì1 to Lae City Dwellers in the semi-final and 3‚Äì0 to Hekari in the third-place match. Their final season to date was the expanded 2015‚Äì16 season, in which 12 teams were sorted into two divisions of six. FC Port Moresby were placed in the Southern Conference alongside Hekari United, but could only finish third after five defeats in ten games ‚Äì including a surprise final day defeat to Erema FC in February 2016 ‚Äì left them just a point shy of Rapatona in second place.

Matthes: Theoretische Betrachtungen √ºber die √ñlkonstanten als Ma√üstab f√ºr die Ver√§nderungen von √∂len w√§hrend des Keimens der Samen. (Bot. Arch., 18, 1927, 269‚Äî281). The term has been used as well an inside joke and pun in the German petroleum industry.  Background  It refers to the constant estimate of available petroleum (√ñl in German) resources. The estimated amount of time until the available petroleum resources are depleted has remained around 30 or 35 years since World War II.Samuel Schubert, Peter Slominski UTB, 2010: Die Energiepolitik der EU Johannes Pollak, p. 20 Prewar and immediately postwar estimates were sometimes lower, in 1919 as low as 9 years and in 1948 around 20 years. However, since then the value has been around 35 years for the various presents. This sort of constant move of a prediction value along time has often been used as a pun, or a rule of thumb.Arndt Reuning, \\"Energie aus Erd√∂l und Erdgas\\" Wissenschaft im Brennpunkt, Deutschlandfunk, 23 July 2006Wolfgang W. Merkel, \\"Energie aus der Tiefe\\", Die Welt, 3 December 2005 One factor contributing to the apparent constancy of the \\"Oil Constant\\" is a neglect or misunderstanding of the fact that the term \\"Proven Reserves\\" does not refer to some absolute quantity of remaining oil that is thought to exist, but rather to the quantity of oil that can be economically extracted given the current price of oil and current oil- extraction technologies. Thus, either an increase in the price of oil or improvements in oil-extraction technologies can lead to an increase in the estimate of \\"proven reserves,\\" since more-expensive-to-mine deposits such as tight oil become economically viable at a higher oil price, and because newer or more expensive enhanced oil recovery processes such as gas injection, steam injection, and hydraulic fracturing allow continued extraction of oil from fields that would have been considered \\"played out\\" at a lower price or using older technologies. Thus, it is possible for the \\"proven reserves of oil\\" (i.e., economically extractable reserves of oil) to keep pace with or even pull ahead of oil consumption at the current rate.Alahdal A. Hussein, \\"Oil Reserves And The Public Misconceptions,\\" Oil + Gas Monitor, 15 January 2016 Analogous use A similar joke has been used about the feasibility of fusion power: Since the 1950s, feasible technological means of using hot fusion for electricity production have constantly been predicted as being 30‚Äì40 years ahead, so the \\"fusion constant\\" exhibits a similar range to the \\"oil constant\\".Ulf von Rauchhaupt, \\"Sonnenfeuer am Boden\\", Die Zeit, 15 April 1999.

Started in 2015 by a programmer known as Chocobozzz, development of PeerTube is now supported by the French non-profit Framasoft. The aim is to provide an alternative to centralized platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo, and Dailymotion.  Operation  Each PeerTube instance provides a website to browse and watch videos, and is by default independent from others in terms of appearance, features and rules. Several instances, with common rules (e.g. allowing for similar content, requiring registration) can form federation, where they share their videos, even though each video is stored only by the instance that published it. Federations are independent from each other. Videos are distributed on a peer- to-peer basis. Users connected to the platform act as relay points that send pieces of video to other users.  Origins and history  left PeerTube was created by a web developer known as Chocobozzz as a peer-to-peer alternative to YouTube, utilizing the WebTorrent protocol to share videos. He was contacted in 2017 by Framasoft, which had a campaign called Contributopia, the goal of which is to create alternatives to centralized platforms. In order to support him and his work, notably on improving the design and usability, Framasoft hired the developer. In 2018, Framasoft launched a crowdfunding on which raised ‚Ç¨53,100 ‚Äî more than double the initial goal of ‚Ç¨20,000. A first beta of PeerTube was released in March 2018 and the first stable version in October 2018. In June 2018, only a few months after the first beta, 113 instances are publicly available on the web that together host more than videos. In June 2018, as a result of its videos disappearing amid changes regarding the monetization of YouTube channels, the Blender Foundation began experimenting with hosting a PeerTube instance to distribute copies of the foundation's videos.  Technology  Video introducing PeerTube PeerTube uses WebTorrent technology. Each server hosts a torrent tracker and each web browser viewing a video also shares it. This allows to share the load between the server itself and the clients as well as the bandwidth used through P2P technology. The system works via a federation of instances run by independent entities. Each PeerTube server can host any number of videos by itself, and can additionally federate with other servers to let users watch their videos in the same user interface. This federation permits collectively hosting a large number of videos in a unified platform, without having to build an infrastructure comparable to that of the web giants. Each server is operated by and stays under the sole administration of a distinct entity. PeerTube uses the ActivityPub protocol in order to allow decentralization and compatibility with other fediverse services, which can prevent vendor lock-in and makes it more resilient against censorship. The software relies on the PostgreSQL DBMS and is integrated in popular video platforms like Reddit and Kodi.

The place has been recognized as an official dumping ground for old wrecked tugboats, barges and decommissioned ferries. It is known by many other names including the Witte Marine Scrap Yard, the Arthur Kill Boat Yard, and the Tugboat Graveyard. Its official name as of 2014 is the Donjon Iron and Metal Scrap Processing Facility. History The scrapyard was founded in the 1930s by John J. Witte and managed by him until his death in 1980. It was then taken over by his son- in-law, Joe Coyne, who described it as similar to an automobile salvage yard, with the boats serving as a source of parts to sell. It is now managed by John Witte's son Arnold. It contains about 100 boats and ships, down from an earlier high of 400. Site The abandoned and decomposing vessels, mostly cargo ships and tugboats, come from \\"all decades of the 20th century\\". They sit in the mud and shallow water until they are dismantled or salvaged. Some of them are historic, so that the place has been called an \\"accidental marine museum\\". Vessels of historic interest include the submarine chaser , the first World War II US Navy ship to have a predominantly African-American crew; and the New York City Fire Department fireboat Abram S. Hewitt, which served as the floating command post at the 1904 sinking of the passenger ferry , a disaster that killed more than a thousand people. The site is hard to reach and posted with \\"No trespassing\\" signs. Nevertheless, there are some visitors: marine historians explore the area via boats or kayaks, while the decaying ships are a popular subject for photographers and artists. Because of its eerie environment, the location has become a tourist attraction, despite its remote location and difficult accessibility via \\"a makeshift path of street signs and wood planks into muddy marshland and to the edge of the water where the boats are visible.\\" Media A documentary, Graves of Arthur Kill, was filmed in 2012.

Ockenfels III (referred to professionally as Frank Ockenfels 3) is an American photographer, artist, and director who is best known for his portraits of prominent celebrities like David Bowie, Angelina Jolie, Kurt Cobain and numerous others. He has also done promotional photography for films and television shows like Breaking Bad, House of Cards, Harry Potter and Pirates of the Caribbean among many others. Early life and education Ockenfels was born in Mendenhall, Pennsylvania but grew up in Lockport, New York, a suburb of Niagara Falls. His interest in photography was spurred as a child, and he often photographed classmates in junior high and high school. He was the yearbook photographer during his senior year of high school. After high school in 1978, Ockenfels applied to and studied at the School of Visual Arts in New York City. Career After college, Ockenfels worked as an assistant for Joshua Greene, Milton Greene's son. He cites Greene and Jeff Dunas as his early inspirations and mentors. For a short time, he was an assistant for Saturday Night Lives photographer, Edie Baskin. Ockenfels' career was launched in earnest in 1988 when he was hired to take a portrait of Tracy Chapman for Rolling Stone. The photograph was initially meant to be a quarter-page in support of Chapman's debut album, but it ended up being a double page spread after Chapman began to rise in popularity. This increased Ockenfels' profile as a photographer. Shortly after the Rolling Stone shoot, Frank met Carol LeFlufy who is still representing him today. In 1989, Ockenfels performed his first photo shoots of David Bowie, and he has since taken at least 15 more. For some period of time in the early 1990s, Ockenfels worked as a director. Over the course of several years, he directed around 20 music videos and 40 commercials. The October 1993 issue of Spin featured a photograph of the band, Nirvana taken by Ockenfels. After lead singer Kurt Cobain's death six months later, the magazine used a cropped image of Cobain from the Ockenfels Nirvana shoot as the cover. Ockenfels went on to photograph numerous musical artists and bands including Jay Z, Alicia Keys, Snoop Dogg, Tom Waits, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Soundgarden and others. In 1993, Ockenfels began working on key art and gallery for television and film. His first job was with the ABC miniseries, Murder in the Heartland. More recently, Ockenfels has shot promotional stills for shows and films like Breaking Bad, Mad Men, House of Cards, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Walking Dead, Men in Black 3, American Horror Story and numerous others. He has also shot portraits of prominent film actors, directors, and other persons of interest. These include Angelina Jolie, George Miller, David Lynch, Tom Hanks, George Clooney, and others. During the 2008 United States presidential election campaign, Ockenfels snapped portraits of future president, Barack Obama. One of Ockenfels' first solo gallery exhibitions was at the Clark-Oshin Gallery at The Icon in Los Angeles in 2009. An exhibition of Ockenfels' work also appeared at the Kahmann Gallery in Amsterdam in 2014. A more recent solo exhibition appeared at the Black Eye Gallery near Sydney in October 2015. His work has also been a part of several group shows including the traveling David Bowie is exhibition which has appeared in museums in London, Chicago, Paris, and, most recently, Melbourne. In 2012, Ockenfels was honored with the Honorary Key Art Award in October 2012. Style Ockenfels has often been noted for his use of non-photographic elements in his work. He applies techniques like collage, painting, and drawing on top of the photographs. An example of this technique is his portrait of Angelina Jolie in which the blue- hued photo of the actress has a red \\"X\\" painted on her lips. Ockenfels prefers to incorporate natural light and authentic aesthetics (rather than heavily choreographed designs) into his photographs. He typically does not know anything about the subject prior to shooting. Earlier in his career, Ockenfels often used minimal equipment for his shoots (typically one light and a mid- range Hasselblad camera). Now, he uses a wide array of different cameras and equipment. Early in his career, he would purchase used film cameras from flea markets and use them for jobs. Ockenfels exclusively uses medium format cameras, stating that high-range digital cameras often produce images that are too sharp. He has also been known to modify cameras with wires, circuit boards, and a wide array of lenses. Ockenfels is also a proponent of Instagram and often takes photos using his mobile phone.  Book/Gallery  From December 5th 2019 - January 11th 2020 Ockenfels' work was displayed at the Fahey/Klein Gallery. The exhibition was a celebration of Frank Ockenfels 3‚Äôs long career and an analysis into his personal collaged journals, featured in his first publication Frank Ockenfels 3, Volume 3. Frank Ockenfels Volume 3 puts together his creative work into a collection of images that provide a window into his visual thinking, the internal world of imagery and emotions in his mind. Subjected to ink, collage, or paint, the images are no longer just photographs of an individual, but become a more personal statement of who the artist is, of his psyche and as such, creative artistry in its purest form. He creates waking dreams, images that represent the darkest, least-illuminated aspects of his unconscious projected on the person he has photographed. He has the courage to go way beyond the expected and the obvious to the breaking of boundaries of traditional photography. The hardcover book is available now.

He had a twin brother, Alexandru Lapedatu, historian, politician and President of the Romanian Academy. The twins became orphans when they were one and a half years old. Lapedatu married Veturia Papp in March 1907; she was the daughter of the orthodox protopope from Bel√©nyes (now, Beiu»ô in Romania). They had two children, a son (Ion, nicknamed Nelu, 1908-1929) and a daughter (Veturia, nicknamed Pica, 1916-2012). Education Ion Lapedatu started primary school in 1883 in his hometown. He continued his primary studies in Brass√≥ (now, Bra»ôov in Romania), then finished it in the year 1888 in Ia»ôi, where his mother remarried after the death of his father. He then returned to Brass√≥, where he was admitted in the Higher Greek-Orthodox Romanian College, then continues his studies in Higher Commercial School in Brass√≥, obtaining his bachelor's degree \\"with distinction\\" in June 1898. In the same year, he received scholarships from the \\"Gojdu Foundation\\" and from the Society \\"Transilvania\\" and was admitted to the Oriental Commercial Academy and the Law and Political Sciences School of the Budapest University and attended for the Seminar of higher commercial school professors. In 1900 ‚Äì 1901 he was drafted and had to interrupt his studies. After his military service, he returned to Budapest, where he passed the fundamental examination in 1902; in 1904 he passed the specialty examination and obtained the Diploma of professor for higher commercial schools. Professional career At the end of his studies at the Budapest University, Ion Lapedatu turned down a professor position in Buda preferring to return to Transylvania, where he accepted the position of second secretary at the \\"Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and the Culture of the Romanian People\\" (ASTRA) in Sibiu (1904 - 1905). 1906 he joined the \\"Ardeleana\\" bank in Sz√°szv√°ros (now, OrƒÉ»ôtie) as secretary and then, after going through successive internships at banks in Nagyszeben (now, Sibiu), Kolozsv√°r (now, Cluj-Napoca), Budapest and Vienna, as director. In 1911 Ion Lapedatu became director of the newly established \\"General Assurance Bank\\" (Banca GeneralƒÉ de Asigurare) in Sibiu. On 1 January 1922 he was appointed Professor at the Chair for Public and Private Finances of the Academy for High Commercial Studies and Industry in Cluj, a position he held until 1938. He had numerous appointments to various administrative councils, among which at the \\"Albina\\" bank in Sibiu, at the \\"Gojdu Foundation\\", and since 1925 at SONAMETAN, the national corporation established to exploit the methane gas deposits discovered in Transylvania, where he became Chairman. From 1928 to 1944 he was director, then Vice- Governor and finally Governor of the National Bank of Romania (BNR).Monitorul Oficial Partea a 2-a, Nr. 030, 1945, p. 675 Political activity Ion Lapedatu already showed his political talent as a student. In 1902, he was elected President of the Academic Society of Petru Maior, the society of the Romanian students in Budapest sustaining the Romanian language and culture through conferences, celebrations, debates, evocations of personalities. It also entertained a choir and a library and issued publications like the review \\"The Rose with Turns\\" and the \\"Society Almanac\\". Ion Lapedatu participated as representative of the Nocrich circumscription in the National Assembly of Romanians of Transylvania and Hungary in Alba Iulia that decided on 1 December 1918 the Union of Transylvania with Romania and was subsequently elected in the \\"Great National Council of Transylvania\\" (Marele sfat na»õional din Transilvania). He received his first political appointment as general secretary of the finance department in the \\"Directory Council of Transylvania, Banat and the Romanian Counties in Hungary\\" (Consiliul Dirigent al Transilvaniei, Banatului »ôi ≈£inuturilor rom√¢ne»ôti din Ungaria). Among other contributions, he made the proposal to establish the \\"Agricultural Bank\\" (Banca AgrarƒÉ), adopted by the Decree-Law No. 4167 of 12 September 1919. Ion Lapedatu was elected in the Arch-diocesan Synod in Sibiu (1909-1911; 1915-1917; 1918‚Äì1920), in the National Church Council (1917), and was a Council in the Senate of the arch-diocese (1912-1921) and since 1921 in the Metropolitan Council of Transylvania. Between 1919 and 1931 he was repeatedly elected in the circumscriptions Nocrich and Crasna in the Romanian Parliament: four times as a member of the Chamber of Deputies, and twice as a member of the Senate. Ion Lapedatu joined early the Romanian National Party in Transilvania and Banat (Partidul Na»õional Rom√¢n din Ardeal). He left it in 1926 together with Vasile Goldi»ô and Ioan Lupa»ô before its merger with the Peasants' Party (Partidul »öƒÉrƒÉnesc) when he became Finance Minister in the Government of Alexandru Averescu (1926-1927). \\"The Goldi»ô group\\" tried to launch the National Party of Transylvania, but it did not survive. After 1927, he did not participate in any other political party. Development of loan and insurance institutions in Transylvania Ion Lapedatu played the central role in the institutionalization of the \\"Conference of the Directors of the Romanian Loan Institutions\\" (Conferin»õa directorilor institutelor rom√¢ne»ôti de credit) initiated by Dr. Cornel Diaconovici in 1898, a model also adopted by the Hungarian and Saxon institutions in 1903 and by the Austrian and Czech ones in 1905. He was elected in 1906 secretary of the \\"Romanian Banks Delegation\\" (Delega»õiunea bƒÉncilor rom√¢ne) acting in between conferences; in this position he drove the development of the initiative from a consultative to an executive role. He elaborated the statutes of the future \\"Solidaritatea\\" Association in compliance with the Hungarian financial law in effect at that time, enrolled the support required for having it registered and approved in 1907; he became its secretary. Under his leadership, \\"Solidaritatea\\" functioned like a de facto \\"economic council\\" of the Romanian population in Transylvania. It was successful in imposing mandatory external controls through experts approved by \\"Solidaritatea\\"; this made redundant the control through Government experts, avoiding thereby potential tensions between the policy of consolidation of a centralized Hungarian nation state and the aspirations for self-determination of its ethnic minorities. Ion Lapedatu is credited as the founder of the insurance system for the Romanians in Transylvania. He authored the \\"Theory of the Life Insurance\\" published in 1902 in Bra»ôov, the first work on this topic in Romanian in Transylvania. He embraced the idea of a Romanian insurance bank launched at the Conference of the Directors and, in his quality as secretary of \\"Solidaritatea\\", launched an appeal in the conference of 27 September 1909, elaborated the feasibility study, advocated the initiative both with potential participants and with the authorities, and published \\"clarifications\\" in the \\"Economic Review\\", explaining that the Romanian population was not able to meet the conditions imposed by the institutions already existent in Transylvania, and in particular in Sibiu, either founded locally by Saxons or Hungarians, or established as branches of insurance companies from Austria, Germany, Italy or France. Ion I. Lapedatu prepared the foundation documents, ran the successful subscription campaign, and obtained all necessary approvals. The \\"General Assurance Bank\\" has been established on 14 May 1911. He was appointed general director, later chairman, and led it to become one of the most important insurance institutions in the united Romania, changing its name first in \\"Romania\\", then in \\"Prima ArdeleanƒÉ\\". International missions Ion Lapedatu was a delegate of Romania to the Brussels Financial Conference, 1920. He was nominated president and appointed by the members of the \\"Liquidation Commission in Budapest\\" (Comisiunii de Lichidare la Budapesta) in March 1920, in order to close open public and private issues between Hungary and Romania, and between their citizens that arose from the integration of Transylvania into Romania. In March 1921, the Commission was transformed into the \\"Romanian Financial and Economic Mission to Budapest\\" (); it was closed in May 1922, and the issues were solved in the subsequent \\"Bucharest Romanian-Hungarian Conference\\" (Conferin»õa rom√¢no-ungarƒÉ de la Bucure»ôti) in 1923-1924, at which he participated as a member of the Romanian delegation. Upon a request from the Ministry of External Affairs, he interrupted in November 1921 his mission to Budapest for a few weeks in order to join the Romanian delegation at the \\"Paris Reparations Commission\\" addressing the partition of the Austrian- Hungarian public debt. In 1922 he was a member of the Romanian delegation in the \\"Conference of the Successor States of the Former Habsburg Monarchy\\" in Rome, mandated to solve together with the Austrian and Hungarian representatives the issues arising from the peace treaties. 1925 he also participated in the second \\"Conference of the Successor States\\" that took place in Prague. In 1927-1928 Ion Lapedatu assumed a leadership role in the plenipotentiary commission that negotiated in Berlin the closure of the financial disputes with Germany; he proposed the final version of the document, and signed the convention to end all financial contentious issues between Germany and Romania. It was ratified by the Rumanian Parliament on December 28, 1928, and promulgated on January 1, 1929; it was ratified by the German Reichstag on February 8, 1929. This Convention represents the first economic treaty between Germany and Romania in history, replacing the Treaty of Versailles as basis for the relationships between the two states. It also allowed Romanian to obtain external loans for currency stabilisation.Monitorul Oficial Partea a II-a, Nr. 1, 1 Januarie 1929, pp. 19‚Äì35.Reichsgesetzblatt, Teil 2. Nr. 8, 12. Februar 1929, p. 81.Monitorul Oficial Partea a II-a, Nr. 30bis, 7 Fevruarie 1929, pp. 966ff. In 1930 Ion Lapedatu was elected as President of the Romanian delegation to address the question of the Gojdu Foundation, following the agreement between the Ministries of External Affairs of Romania and Hungary; he reached an amiable solution in 1936, ratified on 5 May 1938 by King Carol II of Romania and on 20 June 1940 by Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy of Hungary; it could not be enforced in the aftermath of the Second Vienna Award, and as of the issue is still open. He participated as the representative of the National Bank of Romania in the four \\"Conferences of the Emission Banks of the Little Entente between Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and Romania in Bucharest (1934), Belgrade (1936), Prague (1936) and again Bucharest (1937); the activities have been interrupted 1938 by the German occupation of Czechoslovakia. In 1936 he participated as a member of the Romanian delegation in the first \\"Conference of the Emission Banks of the Balkan Entente\\" bringing together Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey in Athens, and in 1937 he participated in the same capacity in the second conference in Ankara.  Publishing, cultural and social activities  Ion Lapedatu started publishing in his college years, 1897 in Gazeta de Transilvania, and 1898 in Telegraful Rom√¢n. As a student he was among the founders of the LuceafƒÉrul magazine in Budapest in 1902, and he was a member of the redaction committee since inception together with Octavian Goga, Ioan Lupa»ô, Octavian C. TƒÉslƒÉuanu, continuing in this capacity between the years 1906 ‚Äì 1920 when the magazine was published bi-monthly in Sibiu.{{SfnLapedatu1998p=65; online:97} He had an intensive publishing activity in his specialty. He started his long lasting collaboration with the Revista EconomicƒÉ (\\"Economic Magazine\\") in 1904 with the first article of a series on accounting; he became its director in 1906. Ion Lapedatu published 18 books, 2 monographs, 298 studies, notes, general economic analyses and reports, 20 papers, 13 speeches on economic, social and political subjects. He was elected honorary member of the Romanian Academy in 1936. In August 1948 he was purged by the communist regime and reinstated post-mortem in July 1990. Ion Lapedatu had a passion for hiking; he was for more than 20 years an active member of the \\"Siebenb√ºrgischer Karpathen Verein\\", the hiking association of the Saxons in Bra»ôov. He was also a member in the \\"Turing Club of Romania\\", in \\"Admir\\", in the Hungarian \\"Bra»ôov Touring Association\\", and in the \\"Enczian\\" society of the young Hungarian hand workers in Bra»ôov; in addition, he was long time President of the Cultural and Sportive Association of BNR Employees, he described his ideas and his experience in the inaugural speech delivered at the opening of the BNR Chalet at Diham in 1945.  Philanthropic work  In all his functions. Ion Lapedatu provided significant financial means to support artists, national schools and churches, among which the Administration of the Central Romanian Orthodox Schools () in Bra»ôov, the Central High Commercial School in Bra»ôov, the orthodox cathedral in OrƒÉ»ôtie, the monument of WWI heroes in SƒÉcele, the restoration of patrimony monuments including the monasteries Curtea de Arge»ô and Aninoasa, and the Gole»ôti architectural complex. Ion Lapedatu was elected together with Valeriu Brani»ôte, Ioan Lupa»ô, Octavian Goga and Ion Ag√¢rbiceanu in the administration council of the \\"Foundation for the Support of Romanian Journalists\\" established by Dr. Ioan Mihu in 1911. He assumed the task of collecting funds, and complemented contributions from significant donors with a \\"greetings fund\\" in which small contributions could be made instead of sending cards or gifts: the Foundation published the donation to inform the addressees of the greetings. In 1918, as Ion Lapedatu stopped his activity to dedicate his time and energy to the integration of Transylvania in the united Romania, the Foundation and its patrimony were transferred to the \\"Trade Union of Transylvanian Journalists\\". On 14 September 1939 Ion Lapedatu registered the \\"Establishment Veturia I. Lapedatu\\" (A»ôezƒÉm√¢ntul Veturia I. Lapedatu), a charitable institution for retired intellectuals with limited financial means and for meritorious students; the founding act put it under the Romanian Orthodox Archbishop of Alba Iulia and Sibiu. Ion Lapedatu contributed almost one third of the starting financial contributions, that included donations from sponsors and further contributions from former beneficiaries of the \\"Students‚Äô Table\\" in Sibiu funded by the Albina bank that has been directed for several years by Veturia I.

The episode was written by Stacy McKee and directed by Denzel Washington. At the time of its initial release, the episode was watched by 8.28 million viewers and received high critical acclaim with particular praise directed towards Washington's directing, Ellen Pompeo's performance, and Stacy McKee‚Äôs writing. Grey's Anatomy centers around a group of physicians struggling to balance their professional lives with their personal lives. \\"The Sound of Silence\\" revolves around Meredith Grey who is brutally attacked by a patient, and sustains numerous injuries. The doctors of Grey Sloan Memorial rush to help her recover from the injuries and remain by her side in the harrowing aftermath. Further storylines include the aftermath of Alex Karev proposing to his girlfriend Jo Wilson and Jackson Avery serving divorce papers to his wife April Kepner. Plot \\"The Sound of Silence\\" opens with Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) teaching her anatomy class. The episode jumps back to Meredith, Maggie, and Alex as they are carpooling to work, stuck in a traffic jam that turns out to be the result of a road accident. Upon arrival at the hospital, the doctors get to work treating the people who were injured in the accident. Meredith is working with Dr. Penny Blake (Samantha Sloyan) and Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) on Lou, a patient who needs a neurological consult. Ben asks Dr. Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone), but she chooses to assist Dr. Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) instead, because of her previous fight with Meredith. Meanwhile, Meredith is left alone with the patient. The patient becomes violent as the result of post-seizure hyper-aggression and assaults Meredith, leaving her battered and barely conscious on the floor. Penny finds Meredith and calls for help. The doctors rush to save Meredith's life, in the face of her injuries. As Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens Jr.), Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew), Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), Owen, Dr. Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary), Ben, Dr. Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) and Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) address the injuries, Meredith realizes she is unable to speak. They soon discover that she's lost her hearing as a result of the beating she endured. The episode then draws into silence as it is shown from Meredith's perspective, who is unable to hear, or speak. Her jaw is wired shut and she relies on her other senses to interpret the situation. Alex visits Meredith during her recovery and attempts to cheer her up. Alex realizes Meredith‚Äôs hearing has returned after she laughs at one of his jokes. Later Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) informs Meredith that Lou underwent surgery and was discharged. He's asked to see her to apologize, but Meredith refuses. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw) helps her prepare for a visit with her children. On arriving they are terrified when they see their mother in that condition and leave. Meredith has a panic attack, and Penny steps up to help, removing the wires holding her jaw shut. Jackson reprimands Penny for jeopardizing the healing process. Amelia visits Meredith to apologize for her prior behavior and discuss her sobriety. Amelia confides in Meredith that she is scared to lose her, but Meredith responds that she is not ready to forgive her. Webber takes Meredith out for some fresh air, and gives her a talk about the power of forgiveness. He encourages her to forgive Amelia, Penny, Derek, and most importantly herself. She agrees to meet Lou. He introduces his wife and two daughters and then offers a sincere apology for what happened. Meredith, still unable to speak, takes his hand as a way of conveying her forgiveness. After Meredith finally heals from her injuries and is discharged from the hospital, Alex helps her get settled back at home. She thanks him for his support, but points out that Dr. Jo Wilson (Camilla Luddington) loves him and needs him more than she does. In the final scenes, Meredith reunites with her kids. Production alt=Denzel Washington in a blue shirt. Running for approximately 43 minutes, the episode was written by Stacy McKee and directed by Denzel Washington. The episode featured the songs \\"My Girl\\", \\"I Surrender\\". In October 2015, it was announced by TVLine that two-time Academy Award-winner Washington was to direct the ninth episode of the season, which would be Washington's first time at directing television. He had previously directed the films Antwone Fisher and The Great Debaters . The table read for this episode took place on October 14, 2015 and shooting began on October 20. Before the release of the episode, a video was leaked from the set where Washington could be seen passing behind Chandra Wilson, as she pushes Pompeo around in a wheelchair, wearing full arm and leg casts. The video substantiated Washington‚Äôs involvement with the show and speculated Meredith‚Äôs injuries.\\" During the winter hiatus, Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter confirmed Giacomo Gianniotti‚Äôs promotion to series regular over the winter hiatus. He had first appeared as Dr. Andrew DeLuca towards the end of Season 11 as a part of the new set of interns at the hospital. The episode was heavily advertised and hyped by the ABC network before its release. In the preview of the show's return, Meredith is suffering from a long list of wounds, ranging from bruising on both her left chest and left knee to collapsed veins. In a sneak-peek clip from the episode, a patient is seen attacking Meredith, but it wasn't disclosed why the patient went after the Grey Sloan surgeon. The Daily Beast wrote, \\"Footage of Ellen Pompeo's Dr. Meredith Grey being beat up by a patient and left for dead on a hospital room floor has been promoted with the admirable aggression of, well, a network promoting an event episode. There's a cheapness to stunt TV, sure. But there's also a crass beauty to it.\\" Pompeo spoke with Entertainment Weekly about the episode and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs for sure the [best] thing I‚Äôve ever done on the show.\\" On working with Washington she said, \\"We‚Äôve never had anybody of his caliber come and direct our show ever. His charisma, he changes the energy in the room completely. Everybody is just at the top of their game. [He‚Äôs] amazing. Let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôm a huge fan. It‚Äôs a total dream come true.‚Äù In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, executive producer Shonda Rhimes called the episode ‚Äúextraordinary and very, very powerful,‚Äù noting that by focusing on the show's protagonist, it ‚Äúputs us on a path for the beginning of the second half of the season\\". Reception=Ratings= \\"The Sound of Silence\\" was originally broadcast on February 11, 2016 on American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States. It served as the mid-season premiere for the twelfth season of the show.

TV Line gave Pompeo's performance the most praise, called it \\"visceral\\" and wrote, \\"If a picture really says a thousand words, this review is superfluous: Any image 'we publish of Pompeo‚Äôs stricken face from this week‚Äôs Grey‚Äôs will tell you all you need to know about her \\" Praising McKee the site called the episode a \\"stunner\\". The site added, \\"We long ago gave up predicting what the Emmy Awards will do. But we will still say that, if there‚Äôs any justice, Pompeo‚Äôs transcendent work ought to get the leading lady at very least the nomination for which she is so long overdue.\\" alt=Ellen Pompeo at the premiere of 27 Dresses. Maggie Fremont of Vulture described Pompeo as giving the same kind of \\"powerhouse performance\\" seen in all the time \\"Shonda continues to throw horrible situations at Meredith\\". Gwen Inhat of The A.V. Club praising both Pompeo and Washington called them the, \\"saving grace\\" from being a typical Meredith-martyr episode. She added that Washington, \\"hit it out of the park\\", and called Pompeo, the key player saying that, \\"Told only from her perspective, it‚Äôs a powerhouse episode for her.\\" Janalen Samson of BuddyTV highlighted Pompeo and deemed her as \\"excellent\\", while calling the episode a \\"showcase for her\\". Allanah Faherty of Moviepilot called the episode an \\"emotional roller coaster\\" and added that it was \\"the perfect return to the series\\". She also lauded Pompeo's performance saying, \\"Ellen Pompeo is an absolute pro at pulling at our heart strings.\\" Ashley Bissette Sumerel of TV Fanatic rated the episode 4/5 and praised the character development of Grey, \\"it still stands as a unique story that allows Meredith's character to continue to develop.\\" She added that episode as a stand-alone, \\"was really phenomenal\\" and that the ten minutes of silence from the episode blew her mind.

The dish is commonly found in Southeast Asian countries, especially Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia, and can trace its origin to Chinese tradition. Variants Technically, all kway teow (flat rice noodles) stir fried with beef can be categorized as beef kway teow. As the result, there are various recipes of beef kway teow exist. =Indonesia= In Indonesia, kwetiau sapi is a popular Chinese Indonesian dish. Kwetiau with beef is known in three variants; kwetiau siram sapi (poured upon), kwetiau goreng sapi (stir fried), and kwetiau bun sapi (a rather moist version). The kwetiau siram sapi is a kwetiau noodle poured (Indonesian: siram) with beef in thick flavorful sauce. The beef sauce has thick and rather gloppy glue-like consistency acquired from corn starch as thickening agent. The kwetiau goreng sapi is a variant of popular kwetiau goreng (stir fried kway teow) but distinctly served with beef. While the kwetiau bun sapi is similar to common fried kwetiau but rather moist and soft due to water addition. The common ingredients are flat rice noodles (kwetiau), thin slices of beef tenderloin, garlic, sliced bakso meatballs, caisim, napa cabbage, oyster sauce, beef stock, soy sauce, black pepper, sugar, corn starch, and cooking oil. =Singapore= In Singapore, traditionally, beef extract was added to the stock, and the soup enhanced with gula melaka and lengkuas (galangal or blue ginger). However, the dry version of beef kway teow is mixed with sesame oil, soy sauce and chilli; thick gravy is not usually served in this version.

It was shown in the U.S. Dramatic Competition section at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival where it won the Special Jury Award. Plot Set in the 1990s, the film opens with a flashforward of a battered Mark (Charlie Heaton) examining his wounds in the mirror before going off into the woods with his friend Jack (Owen Campbell), where a gunshot is heard. The narrative is also framed within a police investigation involving interrogations of the main characters. Months earlier, Jack's single mother, Karen, begins dating a man named Tom, who has a son Jack's age. Jack meets the son, Mark, and the two quickly become best friends. They also befriend a local girl named Sarah (Amandla Stenberg) when she defends them after they are assaulted by a group of thugs. The three spend all their time together, and though Mark kisses Sarah during a game of spin the bottle (which makes Jack visibly jealous), the threesome is platonic at first. Tom shows his gun collection to the kids, who practice shooting in a nearby field. Soon after, Karen suggests Tom and Mark move in with her and Jack, and Tom agrees. Jack and Mark begin sharing a room and grow closer, experimenting with drugs and navigating adolescence, sexuality and the tribulations of the 90s, including the suicide of their idol Kurt Cobain. After Jack reveals to Mark that he's never kissed anyone, Mark makes out with him to teach him experience. They later go out to the woods with some of Tom's guns and kill a squirrel. That night, Jack witnesses Tom physically abuse Mark over a trivial incident, which escalate later when he and Jack skip school to go to the quarry with Sarah. Tensions between Tom and Karen over the raising of the boys gets worse until Karen discovers that Tom has been planning for Jack to join the Marines without her knowing, which infuriates her. Following an argument, Tom moves out of the house and takes Mark with him, which devastates Jack, who is clearly in love with Mark. Mark leaves the school, leaving Jack with Sarah. The two start to date after Sarah is stood up at prom, but break it off when she realizes there is no chemistry between them. The two encounter Mark hanging out with a group of criminals, though Mark returns to Jack after the encounter and they make out again. Though Jack believes he and Mark will be a couple, Mark and Sarah reveal that they have started dating each other. After Sarah let the two talk Mark tells Jack that it will be easier this way. Feeling betrayed, Jack scuffles with Mark and pushes him, making Mark fall and hit his head on a rock. A distraught Jack carries Mark to the hospital, where Tom is informed that Mark will be fine. Mark convalesces at Karen's house, where he reveals to Jack that he doesn't remember what happened, and the two hold each other, which Tom notices. Meanwhile, the investigation takes a turn when it is revealed that Mark is dead. As in the start of the film, Mark shows up at Jack's house with a battered face, presumably from Tom. Mark tells Jack that he wishes he were a girl. Jack puts on his mother's makeup and dress to try to seduce him, but Mark rebuffs his advances. The two get drunk before Mark appears with his father's guns, and the two go into the woods once more. The disoriented pair wanders around the area, before being disturbed by animal calls. The ending is open. There is a gunshot but it's not clear if Mark killed himself or if Jack killed him.

The bank was built in 1926 and was listed in the Danish national registry of protected buildings and places by the Danish Heritage Agency on 22 February 1996. The bank is situated on the Store Torv square in the central Indre by neighbourhood next to the cathedral where it has functioned as a bank since its completion until today. The building is no longer in use by the Bank of Denmark but still functions as a bank, occupied by a branch of Nykredit.  History  The Bank of Denmark branch in Aarhus was established in 1837 and it was the first bank in the city. 90 years later the branch needed expansion and the architect Axel Berg was commissioned to draw up plans for a new building. The building was constructed between 1924 and 1926 and has remained almost unchanged since then apart from a minor expansion. Archaeologists from Moesg√•rd Museum have excavated the basement and area around the building where evidence of Viking Age structures and church buildings from the Middle Ages. The Bank of Denmark left the building in 1989 and one year later the building was taken over by a private bank after an extensive renovation by C. F. M√∏ller Architects.  Architecture  The building design is broadly speaking historicist, combining English Baroque with influences of Italian renaissance architecture. The building is clad in porphyry with sandstone from Nex√∏ used for the base, cornice, attica and architraves. The low hip roof is covered in verdigris green copper plating. The interior decoration is preserved with marble floors, mahogany doors and brass railings. In the expedition room the stucco ceiling remains in original condition except for the implementation of modern halogen lamps in the 300 rosettes as a replacement for the original lights. The design is by Axel Berg and it is the last of his works. Berg drew inspiration from Inigo Jones' interpretation of works by Andrea Palladio.

From the tripoint to its confluence with the Sauer, the Upper Moselle forms the border between the German states of the Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate on the one side and Luxembourg on the other. This stretch of the river known as the Upper Moselle is, however, not the same as the geographical upper reaches of the Moselle, which run from its source near Bussang in the Vosges mountains in Lorraine via √âpinal and Nancy roughly as far as Metz. Vineyards have been cultivated on the slopes of the Upper Moselle since Roman times. This wine growing area is part of Germany's Moselle wine region (prior to 2007 it was known as the Moselle- Saar-Ruwer wine region) and bears the further title of the Southern Wine Moselle (S√ºdliche Weinmosel). The Luxembourgois call the road running along the Upper Moselle on the Luxembourg bank of the river, the Luxembourg Wine Road. It is ironic that the only wine growing region of the state of Saarland is not actually on the River Saar, but on the Upper Moselle in the municipality of Perl. But this is not where Saar wine is made which is also part of the Moselle wine region; that comes from the lower reaches of the Saar in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The wine made in the Saarland in the Moseltor (\\"Moselle Gate\\") area is also a Moselle wine. \\"Wei-i gett mer al?\\", Rudolf Molter speaking in the Upper Moselle dialect at the open air museum of Roscheider Hof The grape varieties grown on the Upper Moselle include Rivaner/M√ºller-Thurgau, Kerner, Pinot Blanc (Wei√üer Burgunder) and Pinot Noir (Blauer Sp√§tburgunder) as well as Elbling, which is typical of the Upper Moselle and which the Romans are supposed to have introduced. In addition the wineries on the Upper Moselle offer sparkling wine (Winzersekt), wine and fruit spirits and liqueurs. They mainly market their products themselves and also offer them in wine or wine-tasting bars, wine taverns known as Strau√üwirtschaften and, during the summer months, at vineyard open days (Hoffesten).

Josh returns home to find out that Rachel asphyxiated herself with a belt. 4 months later, Josh along with his friends Ari, Adam and Eric decide to spend the weekend, that was supposed to be Josh's bachelor party, at a ranch in Ojai. At a bar the first night, Ari meets a girl named Jodi and finds a connection with her; Adam finds out that his girlfriend wants to break up with him; and Eric, wanting to keep the night alive, invites his friend Greg over. Jodi, being locked out of her place, crashes in with the guys at their place after a fun night. The next morning, their friend Aaron arrives with his wife and kid only to find the place infested with drugs and booze. An argument erupts between Eric and Aaron over the matter of Josh's state of mind and the current situation. Aaron storms off with his family and the guys spend the day out with Greg learning about Rachel's death from Ari. In a state of high, Greg turns into his emotional self due to his troubled past. They head to the bar and find Jodi and her friends there. Ari tells Jodi that he is married which makes Jodi distance herself from Ari. They return home gloomy, due to which Eric invites two strippers over to keep the night alive, and an argument breaks out between Eric and Adam. Josh and Eric realize there is a mysterious man stalking them who they try to confront, but in vain. The next day Eric invites a sex worker over for each one of them to have sex with. But, the situation is interrupted by Rachel's parents who are there to confront Josh. The parents ask for a clear detail of the events leading to Rachel's death, accusing Josh to have framed a story with the police. They show Josh pictures of the guys with the stripper from the previous night (the stalker having been hired by them to spy on the guys) and inform him how a second autopsy report said that Rachel's death being a suicide was inconclusive. Josh, in a fit of rage, pushes the bag they brought with them only to find out a wire inside it implying that they were there to get a confession out of him about killing their daughter. Josh asks them to leave and goes to his friends and opens up. They console him, and the group decides to play the board game Adam wanted to play since the beginning. The group then spends the last night of the weekend playing the \\"very complex board game\\" and is joined by Jodi. The group loses the game and Ari walks Jodi to the door while she leaves. He kisses her before leaving, which is interrupted by her after a while, realizing that Ari is a married man. She walks out abruptly. The next morning the group bids farewell to each other and decides to meet again some time soon. Josh and Ari are the last to leave. The movie ends with Josh wanting to say something to Ari, but does not because of his hesitation.

It is a 2-1/2 story rectangular wood frame structure, oriented with its main facade to the south. Its roof is defined by large gambrel gables at the sides, with gambrel dormers and a larger gambrel projection on the main facade. The roof extends over a recessed porch on the south side, and there is a rounded single-story projecting bay on the street-facing west side, whose roof is a continuation of the shingles that side the exterior. The house was built in 1893-94, a boom period of growth in the city, and has been relatively little-altered since. It was designed as a collaboration between Arthur Wyatt, a photographer, and Francis Cabot, a Boston-based architect who was from Brattleboro, and was at the time the northernmost house on Brattleboro's Main Street.

(The Space Station's solar panels are visible at the upper right.) A Beautiful Planet is a 2016 American documentary film that explores Earth by showing IMAX footage that was recorded over the course of fifteen months by astronauts aboard the International Space Station. It is narrated by actress Jennifer Lawrence. The film also examines some of the daily experiences of the astronauts, who represent the respective space agencies for the United States, Russia, Europe, and Japan. This multinational crew lives and works on the Space Station, an orbiting symbol of cutting edge technology and peaceful international cooperation which is presented as \\"a truly awesome example of what we can achieve when we work together.\\" Content A Beautiful Planet utilizes oversized movie screens to show some of the most notable cities worldwide lit up by nighttime skyglow, lightning storms seen from above the clouds, a glimpse into the eye of Super Typhoon Maysak, polar auroras viewed from low Earth orbit, the Great Lakes of North America locked in ice and snow, and reefs just below the surface of the Caribbean Sea. Astronaut Terry Virts has said that while he was in space, > we did science and spacewalks and all kinds of things, but I think this > movie is the most important thing I did because it brings space to people > ... Most people can't go to space, unfortunately, so it's a way to share our > experience with people on Earth. =The big picture= Some of the movie's images illustrate geographical realities that are not necessarily obvious from the ground but which are apparent when viewed from space. For example, the circular structure of Lake Manicouagan in Quebec, Canada may not be evident to a person in a kayak paddling along its jagged, indented shoreline. However, an astronaut looking down on this annular lake from the Space Station can clearly see that it is an enormous ring of water; scientists believe that it is the flooded inner ring of an impact crater that formed when a meteor struck the Earth during the Late Triassic. Similarly, a person looking up into the deep blue sky from the ground may have the impression that it is a very thick envelope of air surrounding the Earth, but an ISS astronaut looking at the atmosphere edge-on sees the reality that, compared to the Earth's diameter, it is roughly as thick as the skin on an apple. The film's sequence looking down into the eye of a tropical cyclone reveals how an image from the Space Station can replace otherwise-murky ideas with sudden clarity. Super Typhoon Maysak was an extremely powerful typhoon that was filmed from the ISS in the spring of 2015. At peak intensity, its winds were so strong that it would have qualified as a Category 5 hurricane had it developed in the Atlantic Ocean rather than the Northwestern Pacific basin. According to Butch Wilmore (the ISS commander when Maysak was filmed), when you look down into the cloud free center of a cyclone, \\"you see power. A funnel 25 miles in diameter at the center of a hurricane or typhoon [causes you to] realize: That's energy. It is powerful, powerful energy.\\" A Beautiful Planet is shown on movie screens which literally use big pictures to illustrate some of the largest of the large scale geographical features on Earth. For example, it shows a snow-capped segment of South America's Andes, \\"the longest [continental] mountain range in the world.\\" Because they stretch across so much varied terrain as they wrap around the globe from Venezuela north of the Equator, through the Tropics, and down to southern Argentina, the Andean Mountains have their own list of \\"greatest and utmost\\" locations: they contain \\"some of the most extreme climate zones on Earth, from ice fields to deserts,\\" and they include Aconcagua, the highest peak in The Americas, as well as the highest in the Southern Hemisphere. The Iberian Peninsula seen from the Space Station's vantage point in low Earth orbit. This photo shows all of Portugal, Spain and Gibraltar, and parts of Morocco, Algeria, France, the Mediterranean, and the Atlantic. The movie also contrasts Earth's driest and wettest areas by showing an overhead sequence of the Namib Desert's red sands on the east cleft by the blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean's Skeleton Coast on the west, and repeats the widely accepted idea that the Namib is the \\"oldest desert\\" on Earth. (Though there are questions as to exactly when and how the Sahara turned from a green savanna into a desert, there is consensus that the Namib has been arid for tens of millions of years longer than its enormous, \\"new\\" African neighbor to the north, and that it has had a desert climate longer than any other region in the world.) =Spaceship Earth= A number of the astronauts in A Beautiful Planet said that it was inevitable they would begin to see parallels between Earth and the Space Station. According to Kjell Lindgren, \\"The ISS is a microcosm of the Earth ... You have consumable resources, and you have to be mindful of how you use those resources. It reminds us that we have to be better stewards of what we have, and be better crew members of Spaceship Earth.\\" This portrayal of our planet as a fragile, life sustaining spacecraft is introduced in the very first scene. The film begins with a light-years- long, computer-generated trip through swarms of stars in the Milky Way; the compressed trip ends by focusing on the Solar System. Even though our planetary system seems unremarkable, it is in fact \\"the only place we know, in all the universe, to harbor life.\\" Mount Fuji in Honshu, Japan, was photographed in February, 2016, using the most powerful camera lens then aboard the ISS. The photograph shows details of Japan's famous volcano, including switchbacks in the trail leading to the summit crater and features of the H≈çei flank crater. In the film, Jennifer Lawrence's narration calls Earth's atmosphere \\"a delicate cocoon of air that shields us from our star's radiation.\\" Of course, the atmosphere doesn't completely block electromagnetic radiation from the Sun; without some sunlight reaching the surface, plants could not harvest the Sun's energy, and practically no life as we know it could exist. The atmosphere's ozone layer does filter out much of the harmful ultraviolet light (or \\"UV rays\\") produced by the Sun. UV rays can cause skin cancer, and catastrophic damage to the ozone layer may have contributed to Earth's most extensive mass extinction of species ever, the End-Permian extinction (also known as \\"The Great Dying\\"). Like the force fields which protect fictional spaceships from damage, Spaceship Earth has a very real magnetic field which prevents cosmic rays and the stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun from harming living beings on Earth. In the narrative words of A Beautiful Planet, the glowing, curtain-like auroras that the astronauts admire in the film \\"show that shield in action. Because we have this magical magnetic field protecting us, we have our forests, and oceans, animals, and people. It's why ours is a planet of life.\\" Our neighboring planet Mars, on the other hand, does not have a planetary magnetic field. Consequently, \\"its atmosphere was ripped away from the planet by the solar wind. If you could stand on Mars today, you would find a landscape of lifeless desolation; very cold, and very dry.\\" Super Typhoon Maysak viewed from the ISS, with peak winds of approximately 195 km/h (120 mph). One of the current challenges in maintaining Earth's planetary \\"life support system\\" is global warming. The film shows how Earth's warming climate is causing the Greenland ice sheet to melt, and drives the point home by using time-lapse photography to show the Jakobshavn Glacier calving a large number of icebergs in relatively rapid succession as the end of this flowing river of ice retreats inland. If the entire island's ice sheet were to melt, it would likely cause sea levels to rise 20 feet (or more), which, in turn, could inundate low-lying cities like New Orleans. Another impediment to sustaining Earth's long-term habitability is deforestation. A Beautiful Planet shows kilometers of ground in Madagascar that have been cleared of trees to make way for agricultural fields, pasture, or simply as the result of logging companies cutting down the trees without replanting more. Consequently, this evolutionarily isolated island suffers from widespread soil erosion and loss of habitat for its many unique animals (like the lemur). The movie also reveals what the burning of the Brazilian rainforest looks like from space. Because rainforests are extremely concentrated biodiversity hotspots, the long plumes of smoke which the astronauts see rising from the Amazon jungle represent the extinction of species that might have led to the development of new pharmaceuticals, economically useful discoveries, or the advancement of scientific knowledge. The burning trees also add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and curtail the capacity of the forest to reduce carbon dioxide and increase oxygen. Even though A Beautiful Planet contains a few dire warnings regarding climate change and environmental degradation, filmmaker Toni Myers wanted primarily to give moviegoers positive reasons why they might take better care of the Earth rather than scaring them. She told the Los Angeles Times, \\"I wanted to inspire people especially as to how beautiful the planet is, how fragile it is, how complex and diverse and varied it is ... Most of all I wanted to show why we want to find solutions to look after our planet. It's our only one.\\" =The astronauts= The film's cast reflects the fact that the crew of the International Space Station comes from many nations. The astronauts who appeared in the movie included: Scott Kelly (NASA / USA), who spent roughly a year in space during a long, uninterrupted stay aboard the International Space Station, Samantha Cristoforetti (European Space Agency / Italy), who has spent more time in an uninterrupted spaceflight than any other European astronaut, Barry \\"Butch\\" Wilmore (NASA / USA), commander of the 42nd expedition to the ISS from November 10, 2014 to March 11, 2015, Terry Virts (NASA / USA), commander of the 43rd expedition to the ISS from March 11, 2015 to June 11, 2015, Anton Shkaplerov (Roscosmos / Russia), the commander of the Soyuz spacecraft that brought Cristoforetti and Virts to the Space Station, Kjell Lindgren (NASA / USA), a medical doctor who had previously worked as a flight surgeon supporting medical operations and space-station training at NASA's Johnson Space Center, and Kimiya Yui (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency / Japan), a space explorer who was made Head of the JAXA Astronaut Group after he returned from his stay on the Space Station. There are five space agencies that operate and pay for the ISS: the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), the European Space Agency (ESA), the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the Roscosmos State Corporation for Space Activities (Roscosmos), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Of these five, the only agency that did not have an astronaut who appeared on camera in A Beautiful Planet was the Canadian Space Agency. However, the film would not have been made without essential contributions from Canadians: the IMAX Corporation, the movie company responsible for the film's towering and detailed visual images, is headquartered in Ontario, Canada, and Toni Myers, the movie's writer, director and producer, was also a Canadian. =The Space Station= The astronauts spend a good portion of their time in A Beautiful Planet giving viewers a virtual tour of the International Space Station, a habitable, artificial satellite which is sometimes visible from the ground as it zooms by 400 kilometers overhead, completing each 90-minute lap around the Earth. Approximately the size of an association football pitch (also known as a \\"soccer field\\" in the US), it is possibly the most expensive object ever built by human hands. The International Space Station is \\"a research lab, training facility, and observatory, all powered by the Sun.\\" According to NASA, the Space Station has about the same amount of internal pressurized volume as a Boeing 747 aircraft; it orbits fast enough to experience, on average, 16 sunrises and sunsets every 24 hours; it has 2 bathrooms, a gym and a 360-degree bay window; approximately seven tons of food and other supplies are required to support a crew of three for about six months; more than 100 US- telephone-booth-sized rack facilities can be housed in the Station for operating the spacecraft systems and research experiments; and it provides more livable room than a conventional six-bedroom house. Research lab The Space Station is, first and foremost, a scientific laboratory, and many of the experiments on the ISS use the astronauts themselves as willing research participants to determine how spaceflight affects the human body. On March 28, 2015 Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko arrived at the Space Station to commence a much-discussed one year mission to study the health effects of long-term space travel. Scientists hope to analyze their mission and discover ways future space explorers might adjust to the effects of weightlessness, isolation, radiation exposure, and stress they would encounter in a 30-month- round-trip expedition to Mars, or in an even longer trip beyond Mars. Shortly after Kelly's arrival at the Space Station, A Beautiful Planet shows him participating in an initial examination of his eye so that the vision decline reported by many astronauts can be studied, and hopefully, corrected. Scott Kelly (right) and Mark Kelly are the subjects of a groundbreaking twin study on the health effects of long-term space travel. Both cooperated with numerous medical tests during and after Scott's year long mission aboard the ISS. Scott Kelly has an identical twin, Mark Kelly, who is also a retired NASA astronaut. The brothers have agreed to be the subjects of an unprecedented twin study; Mark stayed on Earth during Scott's eleven months aboard the ISS so that researchers could examine how an extended spaceflight affected Scott's body compared to Mark's. While Scott was in space and then continuing after he returned, both twins gave periodic blood samples and DNA swabs, and they underwent body scans and many other medical tests. In the epilogue to his 2017 book about the year long mission, Scott wrote that the very preliminary assessments of the data from the mission and from the twin study were promising: In the critical taste test phase of an experiment with space farming, Kelly and his fellow Expedition 44 crewmembers Kjell Lindgren and Kimiya Yui are shown sampling red romaine lettuce that was grown in the Space Station's \\"Veggie\\" (or Vegetable Production) System. The Veggie series of experiments are designed both to ensure that future explorers visiting the Moon, Mars or an asteroid have access to fresh produce, and also to provide them with an opportunity for relaxation and relief from stress or boredom, rather like therapeutic gardening. Earth observatory When Samantha Cristoforetti arrives at the Space Station she excitedly greets the other crew members already aboard, and then she moves to a portal window to take a look at the Earth from roughly 400 kilometers above the surface, orbiting at 28,000 kilometers an hour. ESA astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti in the Space Station's Cupola module, where many of the movie's scenes of Earth were filmed. Describing her first view from the Station, Cristoforetti says, \\"I just couldn't resist taking a peek. I could see the Earth majestically flowing by, almost like a river. I don't know what happiness is, but I was definitely happy at that time.\\" A Beautiful Planet makes very good use of the Cupola, a domed, 360 degree observation bay on the nadir (Earth-facing) side of the Station's Tranquility module / Node 3. It has six outwardly-angled windows arranged around a central, circular window which faces directly toward Earth. The circular window measures 80 centimeters in diameter; it is the largest window ever sent into space. Many of the movie's scenes were filmed from the Cupola, and the astronauts themselves are shown taking photographs and gazing through its windows, enjoying its unparalleled views of Earth. Even though the Cupola was constructed by the European Space Agency for the utilitarian purpose of giving astronauts a workstation where they could observe the Earth, the exterior of the Station, visiting vehicles, and the operation of the ISS robotic arms, it also serves as a rejuvenation area where astronauts can relax and seek inspiration. Some of the most recognizable images from the five space agencies that operate the Station show their explorers within the Cupola, contemplating our home planet. Training facility Much of the \\"training facility\\" aspect of the ISS mission is geared toward providing practical experience so that astronauts, space agencies, aerospace engineers and scientists are prepared for much longer space missions, including a possible human presence on Mars or the Moon. Because space medicine researchers have found that exercise can partially ameliorate the loss of bone density and muscle atrophy that inevitably accompany weightlessness, astronauts on the Space Station are required to spend approximately two hours each day engaged in physical training. In the film, Terry Virts is shown getting a cardiovascular workout by running on an ISS treadmill and Samantha Cristoforetti does strength training using an ISS exercise machine that mimics weightlifting exercises. Of course, both machines have adaptations that permit them to function in a micro-g environment. The treadmill has a harness and bungee cord straps that keep astronaut runners from floating away from it, and the \\"weightlifting\\" machine replaces the weights (which don't \\"weigh\\" anything in orbit) with two canisters that create small vacuums against which exercising astronauts can pull. Barry \\"Butch\\" Wilmore conducting a spacewalk in 2015, with Earth visible in the background. Terry Virts accompanied Wilmore on this EVA; the inverted reflection of Virts is visible in the visor of Wilmore's EMU space suit. The position of the Space Station in low Earth orbit is effectively just outside of the Earth's appreciable atmosphere, and is therefore an excellent training area in which astronauts can put on space suits, leave the ISS life support systems behind, and conduct spacewalks - or \\"Extravehicular activity (EVA).\\" An EVA may be undertaken to make repairs, reconfigure the Station to accommodate new modules, deploy new equipment, etc. The ISS orbits high enough to permit an astronaut and their sponsoring nation to gain valuable EVA experience outside of the atmosphere, but it is low enough to avoid the increased radiation exposure and other difficulties associated with climbing further out of Earth's gravity well. (If the Earth is compared to a 16 inch beach ball, the orbit of the ISS would be about half an inch above the beach ball's surface.) Butch Wilmore and Terry Virts teamed up to perform three spacewalks over a nine day period from February 21 to March 1, 2015, and A Beautiful Planet shows footage from some of their EVA activities outside the Space Station. While they worked, both explorers were acutely aware that spacewalks are inherently dangerous. This is especially true if something unexpected happens, but many of the significant hazards an astronaut is likely to encounter are predictable and difficult to avoid completely. In the movie Virts explains that possible punctures to their EMU spacesuits were a particular concern because \\"you 'walk around' by grabbing onto things with your gloves ... The outside of the Space Station [is] a jungle of wires and equipment and metal bars and trusses. If you accidentally sliced your glove or your spacesuit on one of the sharp edges, that could create a leak, and if that leak were big enough, you would die.\\" Describing some of the other EVA hazards, Wilmore elaborates that the temperature is \\"almost 300 degrees [Fahrenheit] on the Sun side of the Space Station, [but when] you get in the shade, it's minus 275 degrees. You feel that inside the suit. My fingertips in the sunlight would feel like they were on fire almost ... [Also,] you have a safety tether attached to the Station, and it's on a reel ... You can be upside down, twisted, inverted; you can completely lose your spatial awareness about where you are and what your attitude is, and you can easily get tangled up in that safety tether if you're not cautious. Every single movement you make, you're making an effort to think [things] through.\\" =Exoplanet Kepler-186f= After spending almost the entire film scrutinizing the Earth and the ISS (with its astronauts) in low Earth orbit, one of the final scenes of A Beautiful Planet briefly examines an important extrasolar planet (a planet outside of our planetary system) which was discovered in 2014. The planet, Kepler-186f, was the first approximately-Earth-sized planet found to be orbiting within its star's habitable zone, or orbital area where liquid water could conceivably exist without freezing or vaporizing. In other words, it was the first discovery of an Earth-sized planet on which life could reside. An artist's conception of the Kepler-186 planetary system, with the Earth-sized planet Kepler-186f shown on the right, the system's red dwarf star at the lower left, and the four other known planets in the system faintly visible in orbits closer to the host star. The \\"Kepler\\" in this exoplanet's name comes from the fact that it was discovered by the Kepler Space Telescope, or \\"NASA Discovery Mission Number 10,\\" a spacecraft observatory which is designed to find exoplanets in our region of the Milky Way Galaxy that are Earth-size and smaller, and that are within the habitable zone. The planet orbits Kepler-186, a red dwarf star about half the size and mass of the Sun which lies in the direction of the constellation Cygnus, about 500 light-years away. The number \\"186\\" in the planet's name refers to the order in which its planetary system was discovered while scientists processed all of the data produced by the Kepler Space Telescope, and the planet itself is designated \\"f\\" because the first planet to be discovered in the system is designated as planet \\"b,\\" the second discovered is \\"c,\\" etc., and it was the fifth planet to be discovered. Even though the idea of interstellar travel to another planetary system like Kepler-186 is not feasible given current astronautics technology, some spaceflight futurists find value in speculating about the currently-impossible, and Samantha Cristoforetti is one of the dreamers. In the film she expresses the hope that someday future human explorers might somehow have the opportunity to investigate the Kepler-186 system in person. Production A Beautiful Planet was written, produced and directed by Toni Myers, who created seven other space-themed IMAX films such as Hubble 3D and Space Station 3D. The film premiered in Manhattan on April 16, 2016 and made its theatrical debut on April 29, 2016. Despite being announced as distributor, Walt Disney Studios later removed association with the film prior to its release. =Jennifer Lawrence narration= Jennifer Lawrence at the movie's 2016 premiere in New York City: \\"It was an honor for me to lend my voice to such a beautiful film.\\" A Beautiful Planet is narrated by Jennifer Lawrence, the lead actress in The Hunger Games series of films. Discussing her part in the movie's production, she said, \\"It was an honor for me to lend my voice to such a beautiful film that will educate audiences.\\" By narrating a science-themed IMAX documentary, Lawrence joined a group of well-known actors who recorded voice-overs for similar IMAX films, and who were probably not motivated by the money the project would pay. In 2002 Tom Cruise narrated the IMAX movie Space Station 3D, and Leonardo DiCaprio narrated the IMAX film Hubble 3D in 2010. Like Cruise and DiCaprio, Lawrence agreed to narrate A Beautiful Planet while her career was at a high point (she was the world's highest paid actress in 2015 and again in 2016). When IMAX's CEO Richard Gelfond was asked to compare how much money IMAX had paid Cruise, DiCaprio and Lawrence to narrate their respective documentaries, Gelfond replied that none of them did it for the money. =Digital IMAX cameras= The astronauts who filmed the movie used digital IMAX cameras, and much of the footage they produced was shot through the seven window panes on the Space Station's domed Cupola module. The use of digital cameras permitted cinematographer James Neihouse to review image sequences almost immediately and make suggestions for retakes, rather than waiting for bulky, one-take-only physical IMAX film to be developed once it had returned from space. night photograph of the American Midwest was taken from ISS Expedition 46. The city of Chicago is visible on the shore of Lake Michigan, as are Earth's atmosphere, part of the Space Station, and the approaching sunrise. Myers and Neihouse coordinated with their astronaut camera crew to take full advantage of the digital cameras' augmented capacity for filming in dim light. According to Myers, \\"We would not have the nighttime scenes without the digital dynamic range ... What the digital capture did was totally open up that night world to us, with stars, cities at night, lightning and other phenomena that you see at night, like aurora.\\" Despite the fact that the digital cameras were state of the art, they may have simply turned out to be very, very expensive disposable cameras. The total cost of sending a single kilogram of supplies to the Space Station may exceed $20,000, and retrieving items from the Station and returning them to Earth is similarly expensive. Once the movie's production team had downloaded the image sequences, it is quite possible the cameras themselves were incinerated in one of the ISS \\"trash dumps\\" aboard a Cygnus resupply ship. (The Cygnus is a one-way cargo vehicle that is designed to burn up as it re- enters the atmosphere.) Reception A Beautiful Planet has been very well received by customary film reviewers, by popular science publications, and by audiences. All 13 movie reviews listed on the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film positive reviews. This resulted in an uncommon- but-coveted 100% Rotten Tomatoes rating by critics, while 80% of audiences also liked it.Rotten Tomatoes rating for A Beautiful Planet. Retrieved November 29, 2017 Much of the praise for the film centered around its unique cinematography. A review in the British newspaper The Guardian called it a \\"large-format eye-opener [which] achieves a breathtaking new perspective on Earthly life,\\" while another appraisal in The New York Times asked, \\"how can your eyes not bug out when given 3-D views of Earth, taken from space, on a stories-high Imax screen?\\" See also *List of films featuring space stations ReferencesExternal links * A Beautiful Planet official website * Category:2016 films Category:English-language films Category:Documentary films about the space program of the United States Category:Documentary films about space Category:Films about astronauts Category:Films shot in space Category:IMAX short films Category:2016 3D films Category:2016 documentary films Category:American 3D films Category:American films Category:3D short films Category:Earth in film Category:Documentary films about nature Category:Films directed by Toni Myers Category:IMAX documentary films Category:Films scored by Maribeth Solomon Category:Films scored by Micky Erbe Category:3D documentary films ","title":"A Beautiful Planet"},{"id":"49210487","title":"2005 Volleyball America's Cup squads"},{"id":"49210494","text":"Spa Night is a 2016 American drama film directed by Andrew Ahn and starring Joe Seo.

The album features a cross between black metal and math rock styles, with elements from various genres such as shoegaze, post-hardcore, screamo, and indie rock. The album's sound was also compared to various music acts such as Slint, Mogwai, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Deathspell Omega and Blut Aus Nord. Critical reception The album generally received positive reviews from music critics. Pitchfork critic Kim Kelly described the record as \\"an intense listen, and a wholly cathartic one as well,\\" and further explained: \\"There are plenty of moments of outright aggression, bleak, harrowing passages of unrelenting blasts, narrated by a chaotic, urgent voice that veers between angry wails and sparse, Slint-like sotto voce intonations depending on the lyrical bent.\\" PopMatters' Craig Haynes regarded the album as the band's \\"chef-d‚Äô≈ìuvre.\\" Haynes also stated: \\"Merging melodic elegance with blackened rancor might seem on paper to be an incongruent mix.

She attended elementary school and afterwards (1940‚Äì44) Szent Margit Le√°nygimn√°zium (St. Margaret's School for Girls) in Sz√©kesfeh√©rv√°r in central Hungary. In the turmoil of the invasion of Hungary by the Red Army, the Temesy family left the country and settled in the Styrian capital Graz in eastern Austria, where the young Eva resumed her secondary education at BRG II for Girls in 1946 - from which she graduated with distinction in 1949. In the same year, she enrolled at the University of Graz to study botany. Her doctoral thesis, entitled The Polytypic Species Saxifraga stellaris Linn√© , which she wrote under the guidance of Professor Felix Joseph Widder, earned her in 1954 the degree of Ph.D. Sub auspiciis Praesidentis - the highest honour which may be bestowed by the Austrian University system. On July 9, 1956 she married the zoologist Horst Sch√∂nbeck (1929‚Äì2009) by whom she had three children: Susanne (1957-), Stefan (1959-) and Pippa (1961-). Up until 1964, the young Sch√∂nbeck- Temesy family lived in the municipality of Judendorf-Stra√üengel, in the district of Graz-Umgebung. There then followed a work-related move to Vienna. From January 1, 1965 to December 1, 1970 Sch√∂nbeck-Temesy worked on a research fellowship and then up until March 30, 1973 on an Arbeitsauftrag in the botany department of the Natural History Museum, Vienna under the Directorship of Professor Karl Heinz Rechinger. On March 1, 1974 she became Keeper of the museum's Herbarium - a post in which she remained until her retirement in April 1993. Sch√∂nbeck-Temesy benefitted greatly, during her academic career, from her polyglotism : in addition to her mother tongues of Hungarian and German she was also fluent in English, French, Italian, and Russian.

Publications and verifications  Sch√∂nbeck-Temesy authored several volumes of the Flora Iranica and verified a number of plant species. Of the Flora Iranica she authored volume 19 and 20 on the Hydrangeaceae and Parnassiaceae, volumes 23 to 33 on the Acanthaceae, Aquifoliaceae, Aristolochiaceae, Buxaceae, Ceratophyllaceae, Datiscaceae, Ebenaceae, Hippuridaceae, Myrtaceae and Nymphaeaceae. Subsequently she authored volume 42 on the Saxifragaceae, volume 47 on the Grossulariaceae, volume 69 on the Geraniaceae and volume 100 on the Solanaceae.

L. Burt (incorporated in 1902 as A. L. Burt Company) was a New York-based book publishing house from 1883 until 1937. It was founded by Albert Levi Burt, a forty year old from Massachusetts who had come to recognize the demand for inexpensive reference works while working as a traveling salesman. The company began by reprinting home reference works and reprints of popular and classic fiction, before expanding into the field of children's works, particularly series books. A. L. Burt published both reprints and first editions, and targeted both adult and juvenile audiences. At the same time that it published works aimed at adults by authors such as Zane Grey, Harold Bell Wright, and Joseph C. Lincoln, it targeted the juvenile market with works by such authors as Horatio Alger, James Otis, Harry Castlemon, and Edward S. Ellis. The company repeatedly adapted with the market; it entered a popular paperback market, refocused on hardcovers when the paperback market became saturated, and in 1911, in an effort to compete with the Stratemeyer Syndicate, began issuing inexpensive juvenile series books. Albert Burt died in 1913 with a sizable estate, after which the business was continued by his three sons, who each took an equal share. They continued the newfound emphasis on series books, pursuing both reprints rights and new works. The company met particular success with series influenced by contemporaneous influences and trends; nearly two dozen books in The Boy Allies series centered around World War I, and upon the war's end the company's new offers explored topics such as aviation and wireless radio. Although sales and titles declined with the Great Depression, the company continued to issue popular works, including the Beverly Gray series by Clair Blank, and titles by Howard R. Garis. Eventually, with an eye towards retirement, Albert Burt's sons sold the company to Blue Ribbon Books in 1937. Two years later, Blue Ribbon Books itself sold its assets and reproduction rights to Doubleday.  Albert Levi Burt  A. L. Burt Company was named after its founder, Albert Levi Burt. Burt was born in Belchertown, Massachusetts in 1843. He was one of fourteen children born to Vila Burt (n√©e Randall) and Levi Burt, a utility man and musician, and the grandson of Reuben Burt, the last surviving veteran of the American Revolutionary War in Hampden County. He was also an eighth-generation New Englander from a prolific family, tracing his ancestry to Henry Burt's arrival in Massachusetts around 1638. Burt grew up on a farm with limited resources and schooling. As a family genealogy put it, other than four months each winter at a small district school, \\"the rest of the year the farm itself was the alpha and omega of educational opportunities.\\" Burt's father died on January 26, 1860, when Burt was seventeen. Burt moved to Amherst, where he worked as a clerk in a general store for fifty dollars a year along with his board; two years later he moved to Hartford, Connecticut, working for several years as a traveling salesman for a publishing house. During this time, according to the genealogy, Burt came to understand the market that existed for inexpensive artistic, literary, and household books, which many could not afford. In his personal life, Burt married Sarah Prentice Burt in Gilead, Connecticut, in 1872. They had three sons: Harry Prentice Burt (born 1874), Frederick Andrew Burt (born 1876), and Edward Fuller Burt (born 1878). He was a Republican, and according to an obituary in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle had a \\"retiring disposition\\"; he was a member of only one organization, Plymouth Church, of which he served for years as a trustee. In 1891, having found publishing success in New York, he donated 100 volumes of his works to Belchertown's Clapp Memorial Library. He was also an authority on bass and trout fishing, and wrote on the subject. Burt eventually gave up his active work in May 1913‚Äî\\"much against his will,\\" per the obituary. After a months-long illness he died in his home at 178 Brooklyn Avenue on 28 December 1913, and was buried in the Cemetery of the Evergreens. His estate was valued at $191,605.71 ().  History = Early years, 1883‚Äì1902 = Volume 1, number 1 of A. L. Burt's Boys' Home Library, a September 1887 first edition by Horatio Alger Albert Levi Burt began his book- publishing efforts in 1883, even though A. L. Burt Company was not officially incorporated until 1902. In 1883 Albert Burt moved to New York City, and soon thereafter began using a small office at 105 John Street to publish books. He initially focused on home reference works. His first publication was a reprint of The National Standard Dictionary, which contained some 40,000 words and 700 illustrative woodcuts. According to the family genealogy, for this work he poured the entirety of his $900 savings into typesetting‚Äîproviding for paper, printing, and binding on credit‚Äîand within ten years had sold some 250,000 copies. Albert Burt followed the dictionary with a \\"Standard Encyclopedia\\" and several works on household art and ladies' handicrafts, along with such titles as Law Without Lawyers, Household Recipes, Useful Knowledge, and The Family Physician. Late in the 1880s Albert Burt turned to inexpensive paperback fiction, which was then popular and would allow him to extend his reach, with his Manhattan Library line of books. He also wanted to publish so-called \\"good literature,\\" and so at the same time began the Burt's Home Library line with 25 titles, eventually reaching 500. In 1887 Albert Burt launched the Boys' Home Library line of juvenile paperbacks, with individual titles priced at 25 cents and a yearly subscription for $2.50; these appear to have been published concurrently with $1 hardcover editions of the same works. The titles, which included first editions as well as reprints, were by such authors as Horatio Alger, James Otis, Harry Castlemon, and Edward S. Ellis. The line comprised 24 titles, the first 19 issued monthly and the remaining quarterly. Seven were by Alger: Joe's Luck, Frank Fowler, the Cash Boy, Tom Temple's Career, Tom Thatcher's Fortune, The Errand Boy, Tom the Bootblack, and Tony the Hero. The first five of these were first editions, though all seven had earlier been serialized in New York Weekly. The final issue, Captured by Zulus by Otis‚Äîwriting under the pen name Harry Prentice‚Äîwas published in June 1890. Albert Burt's business grew rapidly, and between 1883 and 1900 he moved into larger offices in lower Manhattan at least four times. He also began to focus on hardcover novels, a response to the saturation of the cheap paperback market; dime novels and other 10- and 15-cent publications were undercutting his own 25-cent titles. = Incorporation and series books, 1902‚Äì1937 = The Boy Allies Under the Sea As A. L. Burt expanded, and after it incorporated in 1902, it began targeting both adult and juvenile markets. Zane Grey's second book, The Spirit of the Border, sold some 750,000 copies as an A. L. Burt first edition. Similar success was found with other adult authors, such as Harold Bell Wright and Joseph C. Lincoln. Meanwhile, the Chimney Corner Series began offering 50-cent juvenile hardcovers in 1905; 69 titles were issued under the series in slightly less than a decade, during which the price eventually rose to 60 cents. The company also issued a line of \\"illustrated cover\\" juvenile books between 1907 and 1911, with titles by authors such as Ellis, Otis, and Everett Tomlinson. With cheaper options readily available, the dollar books did not sell well; two first editions by Alger, In Search of Treasure and Wait and Win, are now scarce. In 1911 A. L. Burt began issuing series books as part of an effort to compete with the Stratemeyer Syndicate, whose books were primarily published by Grosset & Dunlap and Cupples & Leon. An early effort simply repackaged four of the books from the dollar \\"illustrated cover\\" line: Wilmer M. Ely's books The Young Plume Hunters, The Boy Truckers, The Young Pearl Hunters, and The Young Treasure Seekers, originally published as standalone works between 1905 and 1911, became the Boy Chums Series, and sold for 40 cents each. They sold well, and were supplemented with four new titles. Albert Burt's sons, who were active in the company, continued with series books after their father's 1913 death; Harry Burt became president and treasurer, Fred Burt secretary, and Edward Burt assistant treasurer, with each receiving a third of their father's 510 shares in the company. They initially pursued reprint rights for existing works; series such as the Jack Lorimer Series, the Oakdale Series, the Boy Scouts Series, and the Border Boys Series were thus acquired and reprinted. New series were also introduced, such as the Bronco Rider Boys and the Big Five Motorcycle Boys under pseudonyms of St George Henry Rathborne. Particular success was had with World War I-themed series, such as The Boy Allies. The series‚Äîcomprising 13 The Boy Allies of the Army books and 10 of The Boy Allies of the Navy‚Äîpresents \\"the boy heroes practically winning the war single- handedly\\". The books were initially sold for 40 cents each, rising to 50, 60, and 75 cents over time. Other publications with similar themes included the Our Young Aeroplane Scouts Series by Horace Porter, and the postwar Boy Troopers Series, which was relatively unsuccessful. The Beverly Gray series by Clair Blank, who also wrote the three-book The Adventure Girls series, was A. L. Burt's most successful series of the 1930s despite starting publication in 1934. After the war ended, A. L. Burt's series books adapted with the times. The Radio Boys Series, started in 1922, coincided with a popular interest in wireless radio‚Äîand with the Stratemeyer Syndicate's issuance of an identically titled series. Several series by Levi Parker Wyman also sold well, such as the ten-volume Golden Boys Series, the seven-volume Lakewood Boys Series. Wyman also wrote the eight-volume Hunniwell Boys Series, one of several series with an aviation theme. Major Henry H. Arnold, later to become General of the Army and General of the Air Force, contributed to the effort with the Bill Bruce Air Pilot Series. As the Great Depression hit, A. L. Burt's sales, and line of publications, declined. The company still published a number of successful series, and even bought the printing plates and copyrights from George Sully and Company, which liquidated. The Beverly Gray mysteries, published from 1934 to 1937 by A. L. Burt, and later by Grosset & Dunlap, were the company's most successful series of the 1930s; The series was a veritable soap opera, with the many adventures of its protagonist including twenty-six kidnappings, seven attacks by wild animals, and three plane crashes. A. L. Burt also published the Rocket Rider Series by Howard R. Garis, who until Edward Stratemeyer's death had been a prolific author for the Stratemeyer Syndicate, writing many of the early Tom Swift books; the plots of the first two books, Rocket Riders Across the Ice and Rocket Riders Over the Desert, resemble plot outlines in the Syndicate's archives for unpublished Tom Swift books, and may have been intended as such before Garis left for A. L. Burt. The Rocket Riders Series was published in 1933‚Äì34, and during this time Garis's son Roger Garis also wrote for A. L. Burt, with the four-volume Outboard Boys Series. The company also published works by Capwell Wyckoff, including the ten-volume Mercer Boys Series and the four-volume Mystery Hunters Series. Looking to retire, in 1933 Harry Burt began discussions about a sale with Blue Ribbon Books. In 1937 he finally sold; Blue Ribbon continued published some of A. L. Burt's titles, terming them \\"A Burt Book.\\" In 1939, Blue Ribbon Books sold its assets and reproduction rights to Doubleday.  Locations  A. L. Burt maintained at least six New York addresses, in addition to a Chicago office, during its history, progressively moving into larger spaces. The address listed in a book can is thus one manner of dating, within a range of years, a book's date of publication. Albert Burt remained at his small 105 John Street office from 1883 until at least November 1884, and by April 1885 had moved to 162 William Street. He remained there until moving to 56 Beekman Street, around June 1888, and staying until at least June 1890. In April 1899 he moved from 93‚Äì95 Reade Street to the Jones Building at 52‚Äì58 Duane Street, where he occupied the entire seventh floor. Burt remained there for some 15 years, before moving around 1914 to 114‚Äì120 East 23rd Street, where the company took up two floors and 35,000 square feet. Around this time the company also opened an office in Chicago, where it had long done business, at 506 South Wabash Avenue.  Works published  A. L. Burt published more than 2,000 titles from 1883 to 1937, including as standalone works, as series of standalone works such as Burt's Home Library, and as series of related works such as The Adventure Girls.

The book of Jami Al Rowat Compilations of narrators is one of the first and important shia books in Ilm-e-rijal. He tries to describe the characters of transmitters of traditions in their classes and evaluate them in accordance to authentic and inauthentic of transmitters. In fact this book could considers as a gloss on the Astarabadi's Talkhis and other books like Montajeb Addin's Al fehrest. This book for a while counted as the original resource among shia jurists. This book has been written during 25 years and Shah Soleiman given command to produce another transcription of it.

Biography and family  K√∂nig was born in 1981 to an illustrator mother, and to an art professor / museum director father. In his youth K√∂nig was already very influenced by the artists his father, Kasper K√∂nig, worked with ‚Äì among others: Dan Graham, On Kawara, M.C. Escher, Richard Artschwager, Joseph Beuys, and J√∂rg Immendorff. After a childhood accident at the age of eleven, Johann became partially blind. But this unfortunate event did not stop him from becoming one of the most prominent and influential art dealer and gallery owner of his generation. His eponymous gallery is known worldwide as one of the most important spaces for contemporary art. K√∂nig's mother, Edda K√∂chl, was an actress. His father, Kasper K√∂nig, is an art professor, curator, and former director of Museum Ludwig. Walther K√∂nig, his paternal uncle, is an art book publisher. His older brother Leo Koenig also works as an art dealer.  Gallery  The gallery's focus is on museum exhibitions. K√∂nig was repeatedly listed in ArtReview's \\"Power 100\\" list. In 2011, he won FIAC's Prix Lafayette together with Helen Marten for the solo exhibition \\"Take a stick and make it sharp\\", on the grounds that it was considered to be \\"the best exhibition project presented by an emerging gallery\\". The gallery participates in international art fairs such as Art Basel, Frieze Art Fair, and Art Cologne. K√∂nig describes the concept of his gallery as follows: \\"My strategy was always to have the best artists in their respective disciplines [...]. Some galleries try to focus on a school. They have a group of certain movements, say, Leipzig painters. I always try to have the most relevant representative from each field, so to speak.\\" Elsewhere he said: \\"I really try to avoid having a school.\\" = Locations = The gallery was initially located at Rosa- Luxemburg-Platz, then moved to Dessauer Stra√üe near Martin-Gropius-Bau and Neue Nationalgalerie in 2006, and took up a second location at St Agnes in Kreuzberg in May 2015. The latter is a former Catholic church complex that was built in the 1960s by the German architect and city planner Werner D√ºttmann and is considered to be a prime example of Brutalism. It provides an exhibition space of 800 square metres. In 2012, K√∂nig signed a long-term lease for the complex, and it was converted by the German architect Arno Brandlhuber into an exhibition space for his gallery. The project won the Berlin Architectural Prize 2016. Johann K√∂nig is a member of the jury for the Berlin Architectural Prize 2020. The building also accommodates other tenants, among these New York University Berlin‚Äôs art studio. In 2016, K√∂nig reopened his original Dessauer Stra√üe location for Gallery Weekend Berlin. Since the gallery moved into St Agnes, the space at Dessauer Stra√üe is also the studio of Jeppe Hein. In 2017 K√ñNIG GALERIE opened a second location in a former underground carpark in London, followed by a third location at the MCM- building in Tokyo, which was opened in November 2019 with a show by Juergen Teller. Since 2017, he also publishes the biannual K√ñNIG Magazine, covering mostly artists from the gallery and also launched design and merchandise articles under the name K√ñNIG Souvenir. In 2019, Johann K√∂nig published his autobiography Blinder Galerist, which was co-written with Daniel Schreiber. In March 2020, right at the beginning of the newly enforced lockdown measures, he began a Live Talk series on Instagram, 10am Series, featuring daily conversation with his artists, collectors, and curators. In June 2020, following the cancelation of Art Basel, Johann K√∂nig decided to hold his own art fair, in his Berlin gallery. The fair offered more than 200 artworks from the first and secondary market and attracted about 4000 visitors. Responding to the success of the first one, the next fair, Messe in St. Agnes, will be held from the 8th until the 20th of September, during Berlin Art Week and Gallery Weekend. Johann K√∂nig is part of the jury of the Berlin Masters Foundation, which annualy awards the TOY BERLIN MASTERS AWARD. He is also a jury member of PArt, an initiative of the Spiegelberger Foundation, which supports artists during the Corona Pandemic. = Artists = K√∂nig Galerie represents the following artists: Koo Jeong A, Kathryn Andrews, Micol Assa√´l, Evelyn Axell, Norbert Bisky, Monica Bonvicini, Claudia Comte, Jose D√°vila, Peter Dreher, Tue Greenfort, Katharina Grosse, Jeppe Hein, Camille Henrot, Karl Horst H√∂dicke, Robert Janitz, Johannes Kahrs, Annette Kelm, Friedrich Kunath, Manfred Kuttner, Alicja Kwade, Helen Marten, Kris Martin, Justin Matherly, Amalia Pica, Anselm Reyle, Michael Sailstorfer, Andreas Schmitten, John Seal, Jeremy Shaw, Chiharu Shiota, Tatiana Trouv√©, Daniel Turner, Rinus van de Velde, Jorinde Voigt, Corinne Wasmuht, Matthias Weischer, Johannes Wohnseifer, David Zink Yi, Erwin Wurm and Elmgreen & Dragset.

Their collaboration and unusual marketing strategy began with a series of albums in the late 1950s. Those albums (and singles from them) continue to be released as recently as 2016. Early life Allan was born on January 12, 1928, in Prescott, Arkansas, to John Allen Pittman and Nettie Anne Stivers- Pittman. He was a World War II veteran who served as a medic in the United States Army. After his military discharge, Allan used his GI Bill to enter the Chicago Conservatory of Music, and he began singing in various Chicago night clubs. Career Allan moved to Hollywood during the early 1950s, where he established MAZE Records. He wrote and performed songs such as \\"Don't You Remember\\", \\"My Life, My Love, My All\\", \\"Never, Never, Never\\", \\"More Bounce To the Ounce\\", and \\"Mother Don't 'Llow Rock'n'Roll\\". He enjoyed a successful career as a nightclub singer and producer, but in the late 1950s, he traveled to Africa, and became enamored with the ceremonial sounds that were used by various tribes of Kenya, and the Gold Coast. His love for this 'Exotica' led him to 'produce' the ceremonial drumming he'd heard. Upon returning to the United States from Africa, Allan sought out a performer with whom he could produce a sound that was similar, but which was more marketable to American consumers. It was during this search that Allan met Leon Johnson, a bongo player who would come to be known as Chaino. In the years between 1957 and 1959, Allan produced eight albums with Johnson, often at LA's legendary Gold Star Studios. Allan's production work with Johnson featured repeated, driving rhythms, savage cries, and tribal iconography that was; \\"intended to trigger the pagan fantasies of the listener\\". Their first albums included Unbridled Passions Of Love's Eerie Spectre (1957), Jungle Mating Rhythms (1958), and Percussion for Primitive Lovers (1958). As a marketing strategy, Allan designed LP album liner notes that told the story of 'Chaino'; \\"...an orphan from a lost tribe in Africa who was taken in by missionaries and brought to the U.S.\\" Johnson was actually born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Allen's literary fiction was reason enough for one music critic to comment that \\"...(Johnson's)...association with Kirby Allan was a classic case of 1950s, pop marketing gone awry..,\\" while also pointing out his opinion that; \\"...(Allen's)... albums can be hard to find but usually are good values.\\" In June 1958, Billboard gave Eyes of the Spectre a four-star review and noted; > A truly unusual sound can be heard on this album. Chaino turns in what > amounts to a one-man show on a variety of bongos, congo drums, steel drums, > gourds and assorted noisemakers, altho the label's sound work doesn't do it > real justice. Rhythms are basically African or Afro-Cuban. In the > background, Chaino whistles, wails and occasionally gives a blood-curdling > whoop. Allan would go on to produce five more albums with Johnson. His last album of new material with him was Africana, recorded in 1959, though both Allan and Johnson had small roles as bongo players in Curtis Harrington's 1961 movie, Night Tide with Dennis Hopper, Linda Lawson, and Gavin Muir. Some interest in Exotica had waned by the early 1970s, but Allan continued to oversee the production of 'Chaino' compilations, re-releases, and cover versions for those who were still interested in the genre. To further his efforts, Allan established the 'Exotica And Beyond' website, and by 2008, three of Allan's LP album covers had received positive reviews on the 'LP Cover Lover' website. Allan moved to Mesa, Arizona in 1970, and while he remained active in the entertainment industry, he also became a real estate broker and investor. He developed an interest in local politics and he ran for mayor of Mesa, nine times.  Death  Allan died in the early morning hours of June 16, 2011, while helping longtime companion Sigrid Dietrich, escape a fire that consumed his home in Mesa, Arizona. His burial was at Queen of Heaven Cemetery in Mesa. Allan had five children; Jeff, Sherry (Marc), Eric (deceased 1996), Monique, and Patric.  Legacy  Allan's productions have been reissued many times over the years and compilations that include his works were released as recently as 2016. Though originally produced on vinyl, much of his work has been re-released in modern formats (CD's) and can be found on various music download sites, such as 'iTunes' and 'Spotify'. In 1999, three of Allan's productions, \\"Breathing Bongos\\", \\"Slave Girl\\", and \\"Walking Bongos\\" were used in the movie, Forces of Nature. In addition, websites that celebrate the Tiki Culture continue to provide resources and information about Allan's work.

Moses Kotane presided over the inaugural conference. Gana Makabeni, who had been the leader of the Coordinating Committee of African Trade Unions was elected president, and David Gosani elected secretary. The war economy led to rapid increases of manufacturing industry, bringing large numbers of African workers into urban areas and increasing the price of food and other goods. This led to much increased industrial unrest. There were 37 registered strikes by African workers in 1941. This led to the government informally recognising African unions. After a one-day strike by the African workers organised by CNETU in December 1942 the Johannesburg City Council agreed to raise the salaries of its workers by 60%. In 1945 119 unions with 158,000 members, a majority from Johannesburg, were affiliated. These unions were not recognised by the government or the employers. Gana Makabeni opposed strike action and campaigned for government recognition of African unions. In 1945 he was replaced by J. B. Marks. In 1946 it pushed, with the African National Congress and the South African Communist Party, unsuccessfully, for the African Mine Workers' Strike to become a General Strike. By 1950 only 53 unions were still affiliated. After the passing of the Native Labour (Settlement of Disputes) Act, 1953 it collapsed.

Regarded as an influential Avant-garde artist during the Socialist realism era, Michael Antonyuk combined elements of Cubism, Soviet avant-garde and Modernism. Antonyuk was an endowed painter known for oil on canvas. His artistic skill managed to express his own style, although early work shows the influence of Post-Impressionism and Cezannism, for example; \\"Portrait of the Artist's wife\\".[Wikicommons art and citation] His artistic repertoire is attributed to the influence of Taras Shevchenko's Academic Art, the Impressionism of Henri Matisse and Vincent van Gogh, the Cubism of Fernand Leger and Pablo Picasso, and the geometric abstractionism of Kazimir Malevich. Antonyuk's widespread artistic discography encompassed Stained glass, Mosaic, encaustic accretion technique, Lithography, Mixed media, and Photography in addition to collaborative works with various soviet artists. According to Valentin Pak, art historian and former Director of the Museum of Modern Art, Kazakhstan, Astana (former Tselinograd) \\"...Michael Yakovlevich worked as an artist on an expansive theme of an all-encompassing palette. The vast expression in his paintings harmonize with today's movement, so we can say that his art is true modernism\\".  Early Childhood  Michael Yakovlevich Antonyuk was born on 12 March 1935 in Tulychiv, Volyn Oblast, Ukraine. He was the oldest child of simple villagers Marusya Antonyuk and Yakov Karpovich Antonyuk. A talented composer who played several instruments, his father instilled in Michael art appreciation and the love of native nature. He developed an attentive awareness to his surroundings, embracing vivid Ukrainian culture. Michael Antonyuk saw a vibrant color, and his paintings would later illuminate all the hues of the rainbow. The significance of Antonyuk's color harmonic expression derived from traditional Ukrainian folklore. = WWII = At the age of 6, Michael Antonyuk fled with his little 3 sisters and mother into the forest to escape the burning of his village Tulychiv.

He trained under world renowned artists such as Roman Yulianovich Selsky (1903 - 1990), Ukrainian and Soviet painter, educator, professor, and Honorary People's Artist of Ukraine (1989). Selskiy was a beloved Professor of Antonyuk, and colleagues. Roman Selsky instilled comprehensive artistic knowledge in his students, teaching the technical disciplines of the great impressionists: Paul C√©zanne, Vincent van Gogh, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso. Selsky is known for teaching Color theory, revealing Harmony (color) in picturesque canvases of Diego Velazquez, Peter Paul Rubens, Claude Monet, Edouard Manet, and Eug√®ne Delacroix.

USSR = Ukraine = Michael Antonyuk graduated from the Lviv State Institute of Applied and Decorative Arts in 1961 with government clearance and credentials. He was given various monumental art prospects in the capital of Ukraine, Kiev. In addition, Khrushchev's Thaw created an allure for exploration and development of vast wild Tselina steppes and virgin land. The greatest migration in soviet history attracted research teams, scientists, and graduates from Moscow, Leningrad, and The Republic of Ukraine. The Virgin Lands Campaign led to the great migration of the early 1960s, representing the 15 different republics of the Soviet Union, including diverse nationalities. = Kazakhstan = In 1961, in the town of Akmolinsk, Kazakhstan, young intellectuals from the institutes of Moscow, Leningrad, Ukraine began to arrive by train. Michael Antonyuk settled among the spacious land in Kazakh Steppe (Republic of Kazakhstan, former Soviet Union). Michael fell in love with the fertile land full of wild tulips and clover steppes. In 1962, he decided to stay and work, committing himself to this new world. Antonyuk began a series of paintings depicting traditional and nomadic lifestyle, featuring \\"Holiday Yurt\\", \\"Aqsaqal\\", \\"Mother\\", \\"Festival at Lake Tengiz\\", and \\"Still Life With Fish\\", 60x60, 1963, oil on canvas; Fragment.

Legacy  Michael Yakovlevich Antonyuk dedicated his career of monumental artwork to his nationalist admiration for Kazakhstan. Art historians focus on the fact that his art reflects the inner world of Michael and his thoughts. According to Natalya Kurpyakova, deputy editor-in-chief of Niva Magazine, \\"Michael's artistic work has appeared in the public service of social needs in construction, district towns, state and collective farms. He was elected a member of the USSR and the Kazakh SSR, under the Central Auditing Commission of the Union of Artists. Fourteen years he served as chairman of the Tselinograd Union of Artists of Kazakhstan.

Allied forces blockaded the Eastern Mediterranean, as they had done with the German Empire in Europe, in order to stranglehold the economy with the knowledge that it might lead to a profound impact on civilians in the region.https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0794/8840a44eb066d36476a16f45cdea42bb9109.pdf The situation was exacerbated by Jamal Pasha, commander of the Fourth Army of the Ottoman Empire, who barred crops from neighbouring Syria from entering Mount Lebanon. Additionally, a swarm of locusts devoured the remaining crops, creating a famine that led to the deaths of half of the population of the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, a semi-autonomous subdivision of the Ottoman Empire and the precursor of modern-day Lebanon. Other areas in modern-day Lebanon, according to multiple sources, were also famine-stricken. However, due to poor documentation, casualties were never recorded. Some of the areas hit with no documentation include Tyre, Zahle, Akkar & Bint Jbeil. Background The Mutasarrifate of Mount Lebanon was created in 1861 as a semi-autonomous subdivision of the Ottoman Empire following the 1860 Lebanon conflict that affronted the Maronite and Melkite Greek Catholic Christians and the Druze of the mountain. Mount Lebanon's economy relied heavily on sericulture; raw silk was processed in looms and finished goods were shipped to the European market. = Causes = The Ottoman alliance with the Central Powers caused the Entente Powers to block international trade routes in order to hinder Ottoman supply. The blockade damaged Mount Lebanon's silk trade, a backbone of the economy. Growing crops was already a challenge in the mountainous region and the inhabitants relied on food imports from the adjacent Bekaa Valley and Syria. To counter the Allied blockade, the Ottomans adopted a severe policy of acquisition by which all food supplies were prioritized for the army. Jamal Pasha, commander of the Fourth Army of the Ottoman Empire in Syria, barred crops from entering Mount Lebanon. Locust infestations laid waste to the remaining crops. The crisis further exacerbated a black market run by well-connected usurers. First grain shortages The Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in World War I on 28 October 1914. The Ottoman government had appropriated all of the empire's railway services for military use, which disrupted the procurement of crops to parts of the empire.Tanielian 2014, p.738 One of the first cities to be hit by the grain shortage was Beirut. On 13 November 1914, only 2 weeks after the Ottoman Empire joined the war, a group of citizens stormed the Beirut municipality to warn the municipal council of the severe shortage of wheat and flour in the city. The train freight cars that regularly transported grains from Aleppo had not arrived and the bakery shelves were empty. Angry mobs looted the bakeries of whatever little reserves of flour and grain they had left.Tanielian 2014, p.737 The municipal council dispatched a message to then Beirut Vali Bekir Sami Kunduh who requested grain provisions from the governor of Aleppo Vilayet and urged the Ottoman authorities to prioritize grain shipping to Beirut. Acquiring train freight cars to transport anything to the Beirut Vilayet was impossible without paying large bribes to military commanders and to the railroad authorities. Grain prices began to soar, which prompted the president of Beirut's municipal body, Ahmad Mukhtar Beyhum, to address the grain supply bottlenecks himself. On 14 November 1914, Beyhum took off to Aleppo, where he negotiated with authorities, securing grain freight cars from the Ottoman Fourth Army. The wheat was paid for from the municipal treasury. Grain freights arrived to Beirut on 19 November 1914 to the relief of the masses; however, the crisis was to worsen as both reports of the Ottoman officials and correspondence from the Syrian Protestant College indicated that food shortages were to become a daily occurrence past November.Tanielian 2014, p.741 Impact Around 200,000 people starved to death at a time when the population of Mount Lebanon was estimated to be 400,000 people.Harris 2012, p.174 The Mount Lebanon famine caused the highest fatality rate by population during World War I. Bodies were piled in the streets and people were reported to be eating street animals. Some people were said to have resorted to cannibalism. Soup kitchens were set up but had little effect in relieving the starving population. The Lebanese community in Egypt funded the shipping of food supplies to the Lebanese mainland through Arwad. This assistance was delivered to the Maronite patriarchate who distributed it to the populace through its convents. The Syrian‚ÄìMount Lebanon Relief Committee was \\"formed in June of 1916 under the chairmanship of Najib Maalouf and the Assistant Chairmanship of Ameen Rihani\\" in the United States. Literary references On 26 May 1916, Gibran Khalil Gibran wrote a letter to Mary Haskell that reads: \\"The famine in Mount Lebanon has been planned and instigated by the Turkish government. Already 80,000 have succumbed to starvation and thousands are dying every single day. The same process happened with the Christian Armenians and applied to the Christians in Mount Lebanon.\\" Gibran dedicated a poem named \\"Dead Are My People\\" to the fallen of the famine. Tawfiq Yusuf 'Awwad's landmark full-length novel Al-Raghif (The loaf) is set in the impoverished mountain village of Saqiyat al-Misk during World War I. In the novel, 'Awwad describes scenes from the great famine. Memorials The first memorial to memorialize the victims of the famine was erected in Beirut in 2018, marking the 100th year since the end of the famine. The site is called \\"The Great Famine Memorial\\", and is located in front of the Saint-Joseph University It was erected based on initiatives by Lebanese historian Christian Taoutel (curator of the memorial) and Lebanese writer Ramzi Toufic Salame.

History  The stone-built Elite Cinema was constructed for the Elite Picture House Company at the junction of Fairbank Road and Toller Lane with a barrel vaulted ceiling and seating capacity for 700 - opening in 1913. The cinema closed in 1924 to enlarge the hall to 1,304 seats, reopening the next year. An electronic organ was installed in 1925 and sound in 1928. The cinema had a large stage for live performances but these ended during the Second World War. The cinema was sold to C & H Cinemas after the war and in the early 1950s the organ removed, the cinema refurbished and briefly supported live stage shows. Star Cinemas took over and installed a wide screen in 1954 but closed the cinema in 1968 - reopening as a bingo club. In 1986 the property was sold to become the Jamiyat Tabligh-Ul-Islam mosque but was partially destroyed by fire in 1987 and partially demolished. In the 1990s the auditorium was rebuilt but the building retained the original stone facade and entrance. Opened in 1914 the stone-built Victoria Picture Palace was constructed on Thornton Road and was operated by Hibbert Pictures Ltd. The cinema was refurbished in 1927 and reopened as the New Victoria. In 1929 a British Talking Pictures sound system was installed, and by 1934 a Western Electric Sound system had been installed. In 1955 there was a serious fire after which the cinema was refurbished, and a CinemaScope wide screen installed while the seating capacity was further reduced. The cinema closed in 1961 and after a short period as a bingo hall the cinema was bought by Wm. Morrisons Ltd for conversion to a supermarket. In 1961 Morrisons opened its first supermarket (Morrisons Victoria Supermarket) in the converted Victoria Cinema in Girlington. The cinema building was subsequently demolished and a nearby modern supermarket building replaces it. Over the years a number of public houses and former hotels in Girlington have closed - The Craven Heifer (named for the eponymous Craven Heifer), The Girlington, The Shoulder of Mutton on Thornton Road, The George and The Royal on Kensington Street and The Travellers Rest (known locally as the Tut 'n' Shive) on Duckworth Lane - only one pub now remains open.

In Reformed theology, the Lord's Supper or Eucharist is a sacrament that spiritually nourishes Christians and strengthens their union with Christ. The outward or physical action of the sacrament is eating bread and drinking wine. Reformed confessions, which are official statements of the beliefs of Reformed churches, teach that Christ's body and blood are really present in the sacrament, but that this presence is communicated in a spiritual manner rather than by his body being physically eaten. The Reformed doctrine of real presence is sometimes called mystical real presence or spiritual real presence. Early Reformed theologians such as John Calvin and Huldrych Zwingli rejected the medieval belief in transubstantiation, that the bread and wine of the Eucharist change into Christ's body and blood, but taught that Christ's person, including his body and blood, are presented to Christians who partake of it in faith. They also disagree with Martin Luther and the Lutheran tradition which taught that Christ's body is physically eaten with the mouth in the sacrament. Later Reformed orthodox theologians continued to teach views similar to that of Calvin and Zwingli. In the modern period, Karl Barth espoused a symbolic view that the sacrament only communicates God's promises rather than functioning to actually confer these promises. Other Reformed theologians continued to teach the traditional view. History=Background= From the beginning of Christianity through the tenth century, Christian theologians saw the Eucharist as the church's participation in Christ's sacrifice. Christ was believed to be present in the Eucharist, but there were differences over the way in which this occurred. The School of Antioch in the Eastern Roman Empire, along with Hilary of Poitiers and Ambrose in the Western Roman Empire, taught a realist, metabolic, or somatic view, where the elements of the Eucharist were believed to be changed into Christ's body and blood. The influential fourth-century Western theologian Augustine of Hippo, on the other hand, held that Christ is really present in the elements of the Eucharist, but not in a bodily manner, because his body remains in heaven. Augustine believed the Eucharist is a spiritual eating which allows Christians to become part of Christ's body. Western theologians in the three centuries following Augustine did not elaborate on the way Christ is present in the Eucharist, but emphasized the transforming power of the sacrament. In the ninth century, Hrabanus Maurus and Ratramnus also defended Augustine's view of nonmetabolic real presence. During the high and late Middle Ages, the metabolic view became increasingly dominant to the exclusion of the nonmetabolic view, to the point that it was considered the only orthodox option. The doctrine of transubstantiation was developed in the high Middle Ages to explain the change of the elements into Christ's body and blood. Transubstantiation is the belief that the Eucharistic elements are transformed into Christ's body and blood in a way only perceivable by the intellect, not by the senses. =Reformation= This seventeenth-century medal commemorating John Calvin depicts a hand holding a heart to heaven. Calvin believed Christians were lifted up to heaven by the Holy Spirit in the Lord's Supper. Martin Luther, leading figure of the Protestant Reformation and leader of the Protestant movement which would be called Lutheranism, rejected the doctrine of transubstantiation, but continued to hold that Christ is bodily present \\"under the bread and wine\\". Luther insisted that Christ's words during the institution of the sacrament, \\"this is my body\\", be taken literally. He believed that anyone who ate and drank during the Eucharist (often called the \\"Lord's Supper\\" by Protestants) physically ate Christ's body and drank his blood, regardless of their faith. Huldrych Zwingli, the first theologian in the Reformed tradition, also rejected the view of transubstantiation, but he disagreed with Luther by holding that Christ's body is not physically present in the Eucharist. He held that Christ's whole person (body and spirit) is presented to believers in the Eucharist, but that this does not occur by Christ's body being eaten with the mouth. This view has been labeled \\"mystical real presence\\", meaning that those who partake have a direct experience of God's presence, or \\"spiritual real presence\\" because Christ's presence is by his spirit. Zwingli also did not believe that the sacrament actually confers the grace which is offered in the sacrament, but that the outer signs of bread and wine testify to that grace and awaken the memory of Christ's death. John Calvin, a very influential early Reformed theologian, believed the Lord's Supper fed Christians with the spiritual food of union with Christ. He believed that in the Supper Christians feed on Christ's flesh, which he saw as an inexplicable miracle. Calvin taught that the Supper confirms the promises communicated to Christians in the preaching of the Gospel. He also saw its purpose as provoking praise for God and love for other people. He believed it necessary for Christians to partake of Christ's humanity in the Supper as well as his Spirit, and that the bread and wine really present, rather than simply symbolize or represent, Christ's body and blood. Calvin spoke of the communication involved in the Lord's Supper as spiritual, meaning that it originates in the Holy Spirit. Calvin's teaching on the Lord's Supper was followed by many others in the Reformed tradition, including Martin Bucer and Peter Martyr Vermigli. Calvin, like Zwingli and against Luther, did not believe that Christ is bodily present in the elements of the Eucharist. He taught that Christ remains in heaven and that we commune with him in the Lord's Supper by being raised up to him rather than him descending to us. Calvin believed the elements of the Supper to be used by God as instruments in communicating the promises which they represent, a view called symbolic instrumentalism. Heinrich Bullinger, Zwingli's successor, went beyond Zwingli by teaching that there is a union between the sacrament of the Supper and the grace symbolized in them. Bullinger's view was not identical to Calvin's, because he did not see sacraments as instrumental in communicating grace. Bullinger's view has been called \\"symbolic parallelism\\", because the inward feeding on Christ occurs at the same time as the outward eating of bread and wine, but is not caused by it in any way. The Reformed confessions of faith, official statements of the beliefs of Reformed churches, followed the view that Christ is really present in the Supper. They either took Calvin's view that the signs of bread and wine are instrumental in communicating grace, or Bullinger's symbolic parallelism. Some of the German- language Reformed confessions seem hesitant to make the sacrament a means of grace, but they all maintain that there is a union between the outward signs of the sacrament and the inward grace signified. Reformed orthodox theologians also continued to insist on Christ's real presence in the Supper, while denying against Lutherans that his body is locally present. =Modern= The influential eighteenth-century Reformed theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher saw problems with all of the Reformation positions on Christ's presence in the Eucharist, and hoped that a new articulation of the doctrine would be made. He emphasized the function of the Supper of confirming Christians' union with Christ as well as the union they have with one another. In the nineteenth century, the doctrine of the Lord's Supper became a point of controversy between American Reformed theologians John Williamson Nevin and Charles Hodge. Nevin, influenced by German Lutheran Isaak August Dorner, wrote that through the Lord's Supper, Christians are mystically united to Christ's whole person, and that this union is through Christ's flesh. Hodge thought that Nevin overemphasized the idea of mystical union and argued that when Christians are said to commune with Christ in the Supper, it is Christ's virtue as a sacrifice for their sins which is meant rather than a mystical union with his flesh. Hodge also taught that nothing is communicated in the Lord's Supper which is not communicated in the preaching of God's word. American Presbyterians generally agreed with Hodge. Nineteenth-century Reformed Congregationalist followers of the New England theology generally held a symbolic, memorial view of the Lord's Supper. Twentieth-century Reformed theologian Karl Barth did not follow the Reformed belief that sacraments are used by God as means of grace. Instead, he saw the Lord's Supper as purely symbolic and functioning to proclaim God's promises. His position has been called symbolic memorialism because he saw the sacraments function as memorializing Christ's death. Another twentieth-century Reformed theologian, Donald Baillie, took a position similar to that of John Calvin. Baillie argued that though God is omnipresent, he is present in a special way in the Lord's Supper because he is present by virtue of the believer's faith. Christ's presence is even more real to the believer in the sacrament than is physical reality. Meaning In the Reformed confessions, the Lord's Supper is a meal that provides spiritual nourishment. Eating the body and drinking the blood of Christ in the sacrament is believed to spiritually strengthen Christians. Believers are already believed to be united with Christ, but the Supper serves to deepen and strengthen this union. The Supper is also a way to commemorate and proclaim the death and resurrection of Christ. Partakers are to express gratitude and praise to God in thanks for his death and the benefits it provides. The Supper is believed to assure Christians of their salvation and union with Christ, which has been communicated to them in the preaching of the gospel. The Supper is also believed to enhance Christians' union with one another. It calls Christians to love and obey Christ, and to live in harmony with other Christians. Reformed confessions reject the Catholic doctrine that the Eucharist is a sacrifice of propitiation, or sacrifice to satisfy God's wrath and attain forgiveness of sins. Instead, they teach that Christ's body is only to be received, not re-presented to God as a sacrifice. The confessions do sometimes speak of the Supper as a sacrifice of thanksgiving for the gift of propitiation which has been received. In the twentieth century, Scottish Reformed theologian T. F. Torrance developed a strong doctrine of Eucharistic sacrifice. He argued that Christ's person and work could not be separated, and that the Eucharist mediated his sacrificial death. In Reformed churches, only believing Christians are expected to partake of the Lord's Supper. Further, partakers are expected to examine and prepare themselves for the sacrament. This involves determining whether one acknowledges their sinfulness and has faith in Christ to forgive them. Christians may have some degree of doubt regarding their salvation, but they are at least to be aware of their sin and have a desire to have faith. Christ's presence A Scottish Sacrament, by Henry John Dobson The Reformed confessions teach that Christ's true body and blood are really present in the Lord's Supper. Regarding what is received in the Supper, the Reformed tradition does not disagree with the position of Catholicism or Lutheranism. Reformed confessions teach that partakers of the Supper, in the words of the Belgic Confession, partake of \\"the proper and natural body and the proper blood of Christ\\". However, they deny the explanations for this eating and drinking made by Lutherans and Catholics. Against Catholics, Reformed confessions teach that the bread and wine of the Supper do not become the blood and body of Christ, as in the Catholic view of transubstantiation. Against Lutherans, Reformed confessions do not teach that partakers of the Supper physically eat Christ's body and drink his blood with their mouths (). While Reformed confessions teach that in the Supper Christ is received in both his divine and human natures, the manner of eating is believed to be spiritual ('). The body and blood of Christ remain fleshly substance, but they are communicated to the partaker in a spiritual manner.

In 1827, John Gaskins purchased 57 acres including the Gaskins-Malany Farmstead property. He first built a one-room home with loft, adding in 1847 a front addition with two rooms down, and two rooms up. A small general store and saw mill existed on the site as well. Cincinnati and Eastern Trestle Collapse August 8th 1885 On August 8th 1885, five years after a narrow gauge railroad connector between New Richmond and Newtown was built by the Cincinnati and Eastern Railway, a trestle collapse occurred in front of the Gaskin-Malany Farmstead (Three Forks). The trestle crossed the creeks connecting the hill to the northwest, where a station for Locust Corner passengers existed, to the hill to the south. The injured and dying were placed on the stone porch. The Cincinnati and Eastern Connector ceased operation after this. In 1947, remodeling occurred inside the farmhouse, and in 1948 an additional wing was added.

It premiered on Broadway in October 1935 and ran for two years. It is notable for being the first project to feature the Dead End Kids, who would go on to star, under various names, in 89 films and three serials. These names include Dead End Kids, Little Tough Guys, the East Side Kids and the Bowery Boys. The original play and the 1937 film adaptation were grim dramas set in a poverty-stricken riverside neighborhood in New York City, where the boys (known as the 63rd Street Gang) look on reform school as a learning opportunity. They played similar characters in several films; their later pictures are comedies.. Plot Dead End concerns a group of adolescent children growing up on the streets of New York City during the Great Depression. Bonnie Stephanoff, author of a book on homelessness during the Depression, wrote that it \\"graphically depicted the lives and longings of a group of boys who swam in a polluted river, cooked food over outdoor fires, smoked cigarettes, gambled, swore, fought, carried weapons and became entangled in [crime] on Manhattan's Lower East Side.\\" The long opening stage directions for Act One vividly evoke the grim setting, and the action carries on. ‚ÄúA gang of boys are swimming in the sewerage at the foot of the wharf, splashing about and enjoying it immensely. Some of them wear torn bathing trunks, others are nude. Their speech is a rhythmic, shocking jargon that would put a truck-driver to blush.‚Äù The boys' horseplay includes tossing feces and offal at each other. Gimpty is a would-be architect who struggles with unemployment. As his nickname suggests, one leg is deformed, because he suffered from rickets as a child.. A gang member in his youth, he managed to turn his life around, finish high school and go on to college. He dreams of rebuilding the neighbourhood with clean housing units, but poverty and hardships have forced him to search for work wherever possible. He yearns for Kay, a young woman who lives in the elegant apartment house on the other side of the street. Drina is a working- class girl who has been struggling to keep her younger brother Tommy off the streets ever since their parents died. Meanwhile, local gangster Baby-Face Martin returns to his old neighbourhood to visit his mother and to find his old love, Francey. At the end of the play, Martin is dead and Tommy is headed to reform school, his future uncertain. Variety's review of the film pinpointed some key elements in the play that fell prey to the censors. The girl Gimpty yearns for is being kept in her elegant apartment by a rich man. Martin's former girlfriend, Francey, now a prostitute, is raddled with disease. The play is full of profane language, including ethnic slurs that were common at the time. Production Kingsley first conceived the idea of Dead End in 1934, on a walk that took him past the river. On November 10, 1935, The New York Times published a piece headlined It Often Pays to Take a Walk Along the East River: In Which Mr. Kingsley Reveals a Few of the Events Leading Up to the Writing of Dead End. It is impossible to excerpt this very revealing and moving article. The play featured fourteen children who were hired to play various roles, including Gabriel Dell as T.B, Huntz Hall as Dippy, Billy Halop as Tommy, Bobby Jordan as Angel, Bernard Punsly as Milty, with David Gorcey and Leo Gorcey as the Second Avenue Boys. Charlie Duncan, the original actor for Spit, quit the production to take part in another play before Dead End's premiere. Consequently, Duncan was replaced in the role by his understudy Leo, who was originally recruited by his younger brother David to audition for the play. In time, Gorcey would soon become the group's de facto leader and the most recognizable of the young actors, eclipsing the rest of them in popularity. Dead End premiered on October 2, 1935 at the Belasco Theatre and ran for 687 performances before closing on June 12, 1937. In addition to writing the play, Kingsley was director of the production. The cast included Joseph Downing as Baby Face Martin, Marjorie Main as Mrs. Martin, and Margaret Mullen as Kay. The New York Times' Peter Flint recalled in Kingley's obituary: ‚ÄúTo bring authenticity and immediacy to the Broadway production of \\"Dead End,\\" Mr. Kingsley used the orchestra pit of the Belasco Theater as the East River. The staging made it seem as if the play's tough young street kids were diving into the river to cool off. There was no water in the pit, Mr. Kingsley emphasized in an interview in the Dramatists Guild Quarterly in the fall of 1984. \\"That would have been disastrous,\\" he said. \\"The theater was drafty; the kids would inevitably have come down with pneumonia. They simply leaped into a net in the pit. Once they jumped, the assistant stage manager threw a geyser of water up in the air, representing the splash. He then rubbed them down with oil, and they came out glistening as if they were wet, but actually the oil protected them from the chill. We also fed them daily with vitamins.\\" When the text of the play was published in 1937, Lewis Nichols gave it rave review in The New York Times, observing ‚ÄúRandom House has turned out a good tough truthful show that could fit as well under Literature‚ÄîSocial as under Literature‚ÄîDrama.‚Äù Reception  The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson: ‚Äú By adding a little thought and art to considerable accurate observation. Sidney Kingsley has compiled an enormously stirring drama about life in New York City.‚Äù He ends his listbof praise with Geddes' stage design, adding ‚ÄúDead End is worth the best our theatre affords. As thought it is a contribution to public knowledge. As drama it is vivid and bold.‚Äù While Dead End attracted many positive notices, not all reviews were favorable: The Washington Post called the play \\"a thinnish plea for slums reform\\". Senator Robert F. Wagner Sr., Democrat of New York, said that the play had a major impact in speeding slum clearance. Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, reportedly saw Dead End three times. Thanks to her, the president requested a command performance in the White House. Roosevelt soon appointed a slum study commission. In her essay, ‚ÄúRealism, Censorship and the Social Promise of Dead End,‚Äù published in 2013, Amanda Ann Klein writes at length about the dramatic effects of both the play and the film at the time when they appeared. Later productions Dead End has been revived three times. The first revival ran in 1978 at the Quaigh Theatre in New York City (Hotel Diplomat, 100 West 43d Street, demolished in 1993). Reviewing it for The New York Times, in May 1978, Mel Gussow observed: ‚ÄúIn its day, Dead End may have had a certain viability as a social document, but decades of subsequent plays, novels and movies have made it look less like a pioneer than like an artifact.‚Äù He added ‚ÄúThe Quaigh is a tiny theater and it is rather overwhelmed by the production.‚Äù In 1997, director Nicholas Martin staged a full-scale production at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Williamstown, Massachusetts. The cast featured Campbell Scott as Baby-Face Martin, Scott Wolf as Tommy, Robert Sean Leonard as Gimpty, Ebon Moss-Bachrach as T.B., Gregory Esposito as Angel, Christopher Fitzgerald as Spit, Sam Wright as Dippy, and Hope Davis as Drina. Set designer James Noone introduced the concept of a large water tank placed downstage, thus giving the impression of a wharf on the East Side. Reviewing the production for CurtainUp.com, Elyse Sommer wrote: ‚ÄúIf directors were given report cards, Nicholas Martin (along with the WTF producer Michael Ritchie) would surely rate an A+ for recognizing this long dormant drama's relevancy and enduring power to cut through the period piece surface and reach to that core within the audience where emotion takes over; and also for having the courage to do it... Kingsley's sixty-year- old street-of-no-returns saga still works as entertaining, well-paced and emotionally engaging theater.‚Äù thanks to the contributions made by ‚ÄúMartin‚Äôs collaborators, the actors and designers.‚Äù In 2005, Dead End was revived at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles. Directed by Michael Ritchie, the revival celebrated the 70th anniversary of the play's debut. One performance marked a reunion of sorts for the surviving relatives of the original Dead End Kids actors. Leo Gorcey, Jr., Gabe Dell, Jr., Bobby Jordan, Jr. were among those in attendance, as well as Billy Halop's nephew and nieces Zach, Jennifer and Melissa Halop. Film adaptation Producer Samuel Goldwyn and director William Wyler saw the Broadway play 1936 during its original run and decided to adapt it into a motion picture. Goldwyn paid $165,000 for the film rights and began auditioning actors in Los Angeles.Getz, Leonard (2006). From Broadway to the Bowery. Jefferson, NC: McFarland & Company, Inc. He was unable to find established actors that could accurately portray the youths in the play. Eventually, Goldwyn and Wyler recruited six of the original Kids (Halop, Jordan, Hall, Punsly, Dell, and Leo Gorcey) and signed them to two-year contracts with United Artists. The 1937 film starred Humphrey Bogart as Baby Face. While it closely adheres to the play, the film changes the character of Gimpty to David, a healthy all-American heroic type who challenges Baby Face. In the film, he challenges Baby Face and kills him in a climatic gunfight. The play ends differently.

The wind is pushed up by the dunes which counteracts the descent of the glider. Because the gliders on the ridge do not reach the required altitude to return to the field, they land on the beach. The gliders are derigged and then taken back to the Langeveld by trailer.

Many of her themes had to do with the environment and women's rights. She is considered one of the most notable poets from Guatemala in the 20th century. Biography Romelia Alarc√≥n Barrios was born on 27 October 1900 in Cob√°n, Alta Verapaz Department, Guatemala to Mar√≠a Barrios Noriega and Salvador Alarc√≥n. She married Domingo Folgar Garrido and had seven children. She did not begin writing until after raising her family and all of her works bear her married surname. Through her ties with intellectuals and artists, despite a lack of formal training, she was able to create a career in journalism and as a poet becoming \\"one of the most important Guatemalan poets of the 20th century\\". In 1945, inspired by successes in suffrage by women in England, France, and United States Alarc√≥n joined with Laura Bendfeldt, Mar√≠a Albertina G√°lvez, Clemencia de Herrarte, Gloria Men√©ndez Mina, Adriana de Palarea, Graciela Quan and Magdalena Sp√≠nola to form the Comit√© Pro-Ciudadan√≠a to fight for Guatemalan women's suffrage. Alarc√≥n Folgar worked as a journalist for radio and sometimes for newspapers, also publishing pieces in magazines. She founded the Revista Minuto and as the editor of the Revista Pan-Americana, traveled internationally. She published thirteen books during her lifetime and after her death, one of her daughters published two more books. She began publishing poems in 1938 with the book entitled Llamaradas (Blaze). In it, she speaks as an early environmentalist and the obligation to preserve nature as a means of protecting the mestizo population. Unlike later poems, known for their social commentary, the collection in Llamarades are united by the central theme of protecting the great Maya tree. Some of her early works focus on domestic topics that were not within the confines of what was expected in poetry of the day. Others discussed the struggle to create. Later works denounced women's place in society and lack of freedom and her final works lamented her invisibility and discomfort that the world around her did not comprehend her, only the things that represent her. Alarc√≥n Folgar died on 19 July 1971 and was buried in the General Cemetery in Guatemala City.
