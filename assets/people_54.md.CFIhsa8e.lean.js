The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. The village was the property of Saxon Kings who gave it to Bath Abbey before the Norman Conquest and it was help by the Prior until the dissolution of the monasteries. It was then granted to Thomas Horner, who sold it to General Erington in 1544. The parish of Stanton Prior was part of the Keynsham Hundred.

As searing as it is rambunctious, this film brings out all the middle-class prejudices against the working class that American movies rarely confront.\\" Johnny Ray Huston, writing in SF360 and Indiewire, said \\"One thing is for sure: Seventeen is without a doubt one of the greatest movies, perhaps the greatest, about teenage life (not to mention American life) ever made.\\" Ira Glass, host of This American Life, said it was \\"the most amazing reporting on a high school that I had ever seen. It's called 'Seventeen' and it was directed by a couple, a woman named Joel DeMott and a man named Jeff Kreines. It was made in 1983, filmed at Southside High School in Muncie, Indiana.

It is one of a relatively recently developed class of medicines known as the nonbenzodiazepines, which have similar effects to the older benzodiazepine group, but with quite different chemical structures. It is a partial agonist acting selectively at the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor. Abecarnil was originally developed as an anti-anxiety drug, but has not as yet been commercially developed for use in humans, instead so far mainly being used for research into the development of other new sedative and anxiolytic drugs. Investigations are continuing into its actions and it looks likely to be developed for use both in the treatment of anxiety, and as a less addictive substitute drug for the treatment of benzodiazepine and alcohol addiction. Abecarnil may also have fewer problems of tolerance and withdrawal problems compared to nonselective full agonist benzodiazepine acting drugs. Abecarnil is a relatively subtype-selective drug which produces primarily anxiolytic effects, with comparatively less sedative or muscle relaxant properties, and does not significantly potentiate the effects of alcohol. The abuse potential of abecarnil is thought to be less than that of benzodiazepines, with only mild withdrawal symptoms noted after abrupt discontinuation of treatment.

History The azulejo tile depicting Saint Lawrence of Rome The oldest recorded reference to this church came from 1672; the Livro da Freguesia de S√£o Jo√£o da Venda, referring to the ecclesiastical parish of S√£o Jo√£o de Venda, identified the visit of prelates to the parish. It was these same prelates that on 23 May 1684, addressed the necessity of constructing a temple in the area to the parish vicar. For successive years the, starting on 7 February 1693, there were references to the temple in the same Livro da Freguesia, including 16 August 1695 and 26 May 1715, but no reference to a period of construction or completion. The azulejo tile was applied to the church in 1730 by Policarpo de Oliveira Bernardes, from an inscription in the choir. Between 1868 and 1869 a wooden choir was installed, without reusing the existing tile. Two niches were constructed sometime during the 19th century, resulting in the destruction of some figurative azulejo tile. The Catholic church, around 1968, began reconstruction of the church's roof and annex, in addition to removing the wood from the corner of the nave and reparation of the pavement, the doors and frames were repaired and there was re-plastering and lime of the facades. It was at this time that the choir, pulpit and lateral retables were removed. This work also included landscaping of the churchyard. On 28 February 1969, following an earthquake, there was some damage to the building, including cracks in the walls linking the presbytery with the sacristy and the arches supporting the southern annex ceiling. The DGEMN interevented the following year to fix and repair the azulejo tile. This involved the calculated removal of tile, resurfacing of the walls and vaulted ceilings with cement mortar and sand, as well as other surfaces requiring retouching, including the sacristy. The DGEMN Direc√ß√£o-Geral de Edif√≠cios e Monumentos Nacionais (General- Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments) interevened between 1969-1970, with repairs to the building caused by this event. This included the surveying and repositioning of the main ceiling coverings; the removal of existing cornerstones over the arches, and replacement by cement basis; the resealing of joints; plastering; assessment of the roofing; and the plastering of the exterior parapets. By the end of 1970, almost all the azulejo tile that covered the walls, vaulted ceiling and cupola had become extracted from the walls/coverings, with several broken, lost or in a state of imminent dislocation repaired. In 1984 there was a reconsolidation of the wooden cupola. Architecture The front facade of the church, showing the two-tier format with azulejo tile crowning the frontispiece The church is situated in an urban area, encircled by churchyard, and accessed by a staircase to the north. It is delimited by an elevated platform over the natural terrain, supported by walls in masonry and morter. The building and churchyard complex is circled by several small dependencies, which harmoniously form the group, including complimentary azulejo tiles designed by Policarpo de Oliveira Bernardes. The plan of the church consists of one nave, with rectangular prebystery, lateral chapels, and sacristy in the north. The roofing is differentiated by coverings on the nave, cupola and pinnacles. The principal facade, with minimal decoration, consists of two volumes, with angular corners and a counter-curved frontispiece. A rectangular doorway, surmounted by a window, with lateral pilasters ending in pinnacles, crowned by a fanciful frontispiece and cross. The recessed second volume, is broken by a rectangular door, with a lateral doorway surmounted by the image of Saint Lawrence in stone. The southern lateral face, without decoration, is aligned with the church nave and marked by four small rectangular windows. In the head panel are blue and white azulejos with the image of Saint Lawrence, dating from 1730. The northern facade is marked by a belltower which rises above the sacristy, accessible from a long staircase at the front left of the main facade. Interior The barrel-vaulted nave is broken by a cupola, and totally covered in azulejo tile, except for the corners, frames and frames of the windows. These azulejos show scenes from the life of S√£o Lawrence and in each arch, accompanied by his legend in Latin. Lawrence of Rome was martyred in Rome in 258, for challenging Emperor Decius who expected tribute from the church, to which he was deacon. Lawrence distributed the gold to the poor instead, and little reached the Emperor's coffers. Furious, the Emperor ordered the cleric be whipped with rods, then his back seared with burning hot iron, before being extended over a mound of embers (to die).R√©au (1997), vol. 4, p.255 The tiles depict: the saint healing two blind men; the saint giving money to the poor; the saint talking with Pope Sixtus II; the saint arguing for his Christian belief with Roman Emperor Valerian; and the saint's martyrdom. Over the arches are allegorical figures: Preserverance, Liberty and Poverty, Chastity and Obedience, Piety and Patience, Awe of God and Understanding, and Humility. The tiles that cover the cupola following architectural designs with perspectives. Over the window is an inscription: \\"POLICARPO DE / OLIVEIRA BERN. / PINTOU ESTA OBRA DE AZU / LEIO\\" (Policarpo de Oliveira Bern. Painted this work of azulejo); in the centre of the vaulted nave is Lawrence in glory, accompanied by angels to his rest, and the caption: \\"FEITO / NO ANNO DE 1730 / SENDO VIG√ÅRIO GERAL O R.DO D.TOR M.EL DE SOUZA / TEIXEIRA / JUIS DOSTO\\" (Done in the year 1730, being the Vicar-General Ricardo Tormel de Sousa Teixeira judge).Jos√© Meco (1989), p.84 The extensive azulejo has resulted in it being referred to as the Igreja de Lou√ßa (Church of China).J. M. dos Santos Sim√µes (1949), p.2 In the sacristy sillar are azulejo tiles, with bar and panels in flowering vases. In the nave's papal altar, there are two niches; the chancel with altar marble stone from Alicante and gilded altarpiece. The baptismal fonte is also constructed of Alicante stone. The interior is totally decorated in 17th century azulejo tiles with scenes from the life of Saint Lawrence, designed by Policarpo de Oliveira Bernardes, which comprised one of the most important group of azueljo tile in the country. The complexity is comparable to the azueljo decoration in the presbytery of the Church of S√£o Francisco in Faro, also attributed to this author and the Miserc√≥rdia Church in Viana do Castelo, complete by the Policarpo's father (Ant√≥nio de Oliveira Bernardes).

It ranks above commander and below commodore and has a NATO ranking code of OF-5. The rank is equivalent to a colonel in the British Army and Royal Marines, and to a group captain in the Royal Air Force. There are similarly named equivalent ranks in the navies of many other countries. Seagoing captains In the Royal Navy, the officer in command of any warship of the rank of commander and below is informally referred to as \\"the captain\\" on board, even though holding a junior rank, but formally is titled \\"the commanding officer\\" (or CO). In former times, up until the nineteenth century, Royal Navy officers who were captains by rank and in command of a naval vessel were referred to as post-captains; this practice is now defunct. A Captain (D) or Captain Destroyers afloat was an operational commander responsible for the command of destroyer flotilla or squadron, for a decade plus after the Second World War. The title was probably used informally up until the abolition of frigate and destroyer squadrons with the Fleet FIRST reorganisation circa 2001. Terminology Ashore, the rank of captain is often verbally described as \\"captain RN\\" to distinguish it from the more junior Army and Royal Marines rank, and in naval contexts, as a \\"four- ring captain\\" (referring to the uniform lace) to avoid confusion with the title of a seagoing commanding officer. In the Ministry of Defence, and in joint service establishments, a captain may be referred to as a \\"DACOS\\" (standing for deputy assistant chief of staff) or an \\"AH\\" (assistant head), from the usual job title of OF5-ranked individuals who work with civil servants. Insignia and uniform The rank insignia features four rings of gold braid with a loop in the upper ring. When in mess dress or mess undress, officers of the rank of captain and above wear gold-laced trousers (the trousers are known as \\"tin trousers\\", and the gold lace stripes thereon are nicknamed \\"lightning conductors\\"), and may wear the undress tailcoat (without epaulettes).

The organisation campaigns for a more participatory democracy in Britain, founded upon a written constitution. Unlock Democracy works to promote democratic reform across the political spectrum and is not aligned with any political party. The organisation's activities include producing a range of publications, lobbying politicians and political parties and working on projects to promote greater public involvement in politics, at both local and national levels. Unlock Democracy is led by a governing council, elected by all members biannually. The Council in turn elects its own chair and a management board which oversees the day to day running of the organisation. It is funded from three main sources: grant income for specific projects from various foundations and trusts, subscriptions and donations from its members and supporters, and income from its subsidiary company Rodell Properties Ltd. The founding Director was Peter Facey. Who was Director of Unlock Democracy‚Äôs predecessor organisation the New Politics Network in 2001 and later becoming Director of Charter 88. He was responsible for the merger of the two organisations in 2007. Being succeeded as Director in 2013 by long-time deputy Director Alexandra Runswick, who led the organisation until early 2020. In October 2020, Former Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake was appointed as the new Director of Unlock Democracy.  History  In 2003, 15 years after the formation of Charter 88, the organisation was experiencing a very turbulent period and this led to great organisational changes. A loss of intellectual contribution, the organisation's increasing financial woes and a period of resignations and redundancies created a near crisis situation in late 2003. In February 2005, Charter 88 and the New Politics Network (NPN) set up a joint working relationship to make the most of their resources in the establishment of the Elect the Lords campaign. The two organisations decided to formalise their working relationship in 2006, and Unlock Democracy was founded in 2007. Members of Charter 88 (a pressure group advocating a charter of connected constitutional changes, including a written constitution, electoral reform, freedom of information, etc.) and NPN (the organisation established after the winding up of the think tank Democratic Left, which was itself the legal successor of the Communist Party of Great Britain) voted to merge the two organisations. The movement and subsequent campaigning of the organisation could be seen as remaining truer to its Charter 88 roots than those of the NPN. The NPN strapline, however, \\"connecting people and politics\\", was retained. The merger was completed in November 2007.Unlock Democracy Website - History http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/pages/a-short-history  Campaign goals  Unlock Democracy arguing for a \\"vibrant, inclusive democracy that puts power in the hands of the people\\". Its primary goal is the setting in place of a democratic participative process resulting in a written constitution. It is suggested that this constitution should explicitly enshrine; * The separation of powers between the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. * The divisions and limitations of powers between central and local government within the UK.Unlock Democracy Website - Purpose http://www.unlockdemocracy.org.uk/pages/purpose-and-constitution * Basic liberties and human rights for all. In addition to this, Unlock Democracy also campaigns; * For fair and open elections * For transparency in public decision making * To ensure that power is exercised as closely to people as is practicable * To empower individuals and their communities to have a greater say in over the decision that affect them * For Democratic accountability for all elected officials, government and public bodies * For universal human rights for all The Unlock Democracy constitution contains the Charter (a set of aims set out by predecessor organisation Charter 88) as an appendix. Thus implying that Unlock Democracy supports these goals to some extent.  Campaign achievements  Unlock Democracy has engaged with the Ministry of Justice Governance of Britain programme. It attends party conferences and runs external events such as People and Politics Day. It continues to work with and support other organisations such as Local Works on the Sustainable Communities Act. Lastly, it continues its work on democratic reform, including the Elect the Lords campaign, and the campaign for a review of the UK general election electoral system.  Funding  Unlock Democracy has been given an A grade for funding transparency by Who Funds You?

The Georgian Chronicles relate the apocryphal story of Alexander the Great‚Äôs campaign into inner Georgia. Alexander reportedly brought Azoy (Azo), the son of the unnamed \\"king of Arian-Kartli\\", together with followers, to Mtskheta, principal city of Kartli, and charged him with the administration of Kartli in his absence. The 11th-century Georgian monk Arsen, the author of metaphrastical reduction of \\"The life of St. Nino\\" and tutor of King David IV of Georgia, comments on this passage: \\"We, Georgians, are descendants of the newcomers from Arian-Kartli, we speak their language and all the kings of Kartli are descendants of their kings\\".Giorgi L.

The identification of a polity medieval Georgian writers called Arian Kartli remains problematic. It seems to have preceded the Near Eastern conquests of Alexander the Great, but the precise location of this \\"kingdom\\", the date of its foundation, and the identity of its rulers cannot be determined by means of surviving documentary evidence. The word \\"Aryan\\" (Noble) comes from the ancient Indian language called Sanskrit or Ancient Iranian being in both cases of common Indo-Iranian origin H. W. Bailey.

(Arian Kartli/Aryan Kartli) and Classical sources scholars have inferred that this land lay within the orbit of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. Herodotus' list of the Achaemenid provinces, which places the proto-Georgian tribes within the 13th and 19th satrapies, is significant in this regard.Rapp (2003), p. 10. These territories partially correspond to the historical Georgian southwest where a number of Georgian scholars, notably Giorgi Melikishvili, tend to place Aryan Kartli. The early Georgian kingdom of Kartli/Iberia, which clearly emerges in historical accounts of Hellenistic period, seems to have shared the Iranian bonds of Arian Kartli.

Spurgeon Building seen from Fourth St. between Broadway and Sycamore Old Santa Ana California Historical Landmark 204 Downtown Santa Ana is the historic city center of Santa Ana, the county seat of Orange County, California. It is the institutional center for the city of Santa Ana as well as Orange County, a retail and business hub, and has in recent years developed rapidly as a regional cultural, entertainment and culinary center for Orange County. The Downtown Santa Ana Historic Districts are listed with the National Trust for Historic Preservation and consist of numerous historic buildings across the area.californiahistoricallandmarks.com chl-204 History The City of Santa Ana was established in 1869 by William Spurgeon on of land purchased from the old Spanish land grant, Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana. The County of Orange was formed in 1889 by William Spurgeon and James McFadden. Santa Ana was chosen as the county seat of government because of its larger growth as a town compared to surrounding towns such as Orange. The Old Orange County Courthouse was built in 1901 and the town grew into the county's main economic and political center. The surrounding old town buildings make up the Santa Ana Historical Downtown. Location City studies and merchant associations generally define Downtown as the area between Ross Street on the west, Minter Street on the east, First Street on the south and Civic Center Drive on the north. Neighborhood organizations define Downtown more narrowly, extendings only as far east as Main Street, with the area east of Main part of the Lacy neighborhood; the Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center train and bus station is located at the east end of Lacy along Santiago Avenue. Sub- districts Downtown consists of several sub-districts, each with its own character: an institutional area including the Civic Center, the Artists Village, Calle Cuatro and the East End. Civic Center The Santa Ana Civic Center, also known as the Orange County Civic Center, http://www.ocpublicworks.com/about/orange_county_civic_center_authority anchors the west side of Downtown and is home to city, county and federal buildings including: City: *Santa Ana City Hall (Civic Center Plaza) *Santa Ana Civic Center Plaza (Ross, Civic Center, Santa Ana Blvd, Flower) *Santa Ana Public Library (Civic Center Dr. & Ross) County: *Santa Ana Transit Terminal ‚Äì Orange County Transportation Authority (OCTA) (Santa Ana Blvd & Ross) *Old Orange County Courthouse (Civic Center, Broadway, Sycamore, Santa Ana Blvd.) *Orange County Courthouse (Civic Center Plaza) *Orange County Public Law Library (Civic Center Plaza) Federal: *Ronald Reagan Federal Building and United States Courthouse (4th & Broadway) *Fourth District Court of Appeals (Civic Center Plaza on the corner of Santa Ana Blvd & Ross) *Office of the District Attorney (Near the corner of Ross & Civic Center) *Consulate of Mexico (Near Civic Center & Broadway intersection) Fourth Street/Calle Cuatro Rankin's Department Store ca. 1917 Hospitality, entertainment and retail in Santa Ana's historic Downtown is centered along historic Fourth Street, better known locally by its equivalent name in Spanish, Calle Cuatro. Fourth Street stretches from the Civic Center in the west, eastward, with part of it a pedestrian-friendly outdoor mall. The West End, located between Ross Street, Broadway, and West 4th Street, across from the Ronald Reagan Building, is home to lounge caf√©s, restaurants, coffee shops, craft breweries, bars, jewelers and other retail, barber shops, and movie and concert theaters. Over the past years, this area has developed into an LGBT cultural and entertainment hub with facilities such as Theater Out, VLVT (Velvet) Lounge, and the West 4th Street corridor host to the annual Orange County Pride Festival. The middle section of Calle Cuatro (roughly from Main east to Spurgeon) is home to retailers for travel, insurance, clothing, electronics, sports, shoes, baptismal certification, bridal and banking The Rankin Building, 117 W. Fourth Street at Sycamore, is a reminder of the heyday of Downtown Santa Ana as a shopping mecca, with department stores such as Santa Ana's own Rankin's as well as Montgomery Ward, J. C. Penney, and Buffums. Eventually the area lost business to the new malls at Honer Plaza and Santa Ana Fashion Square when they opened in 1958, and later on, to South Coast Plaza. The East End is a cultural hub, with restaurants such as The Playground (started by former Great Food Truck Race winner Chef Jason Quinn) and the refurbished Yost Theater. *The refurbished Frida Cinema is a two-screen theater converted to an art-house theater showcasing independent film and film related programming, community-building, and education. Special events at the Frida Cinema include weekly Sunday matinees, student films, foreign films, film festivals, and cult classics such as the Rocky Horror Picture Show. *In February 2015, the Fourth Street Market opened, an indoor food hall along the lines of e.g. Grand Central Market in Downtown Los Angeles. Tenanta include Portola Coffee, Electric City Butcher, as well as host an incubator/accelerator kitchen where emerging food producers can prepare, package, and sell their goods. Partnered with Food Centricity, the kitchen also offers culinary education and acceleration and consulting services. Even further east, the Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center is located along Santiago Avenue in the Lacy neighborhood. Artists Village The Artists Village is an area composed of art galleries, studios, creative offices, design workshops, and several restaurants. It is located on Second Street at Broadway, in the center of Historic Downtown Santa Ana. The village extends from First Street to Fourth Street, Bush Street to Birch, and surrounding the Second Street Mall between Broadway and Sycamore Street. Originally proposed in the mid-1980s, the village was meant to revitalize one of Orange County's oldest cities and bring back part of a once-thriving downtown with dozens of historical buildings, most vacant for years. In collaboration between the Santa Ana City Council, the community activist Don Cribb, and Cal State Fullerton‚Äôs Gallery Director Mike McGee, a plan for the Grand Central Art Center was conceived in 1994. A designated ten-square block would become the Artists Village. The subsequent success of the Artists Village has helped spawn a cultural and economic renewal. In the early 2000s, several live-work loft developments came to the downtown including Main Street Studio Lofts, East Village, as well as Artists Village lofts. These artist-centric developments allowed homeowners to experience downtown living while providing them an opportunity to help the flourishing art movement continue to move forward. Today, the Artists Village is the home to various restaurants, shops, artist galleries, as well as art institutions, including Cal State Fullerton Grand Central Art Center and the Orange County Center for Contemporary Art. Historic Districts Located across several of the aforementioned sub- districts, the Downtown Santa Ana Historic Districts are several historic districts listed as one entry in the National Register of Historic Places since 1984, covering and characterized by a number of Art Deco buildings as well as two old movie houses (The West End and the Fox West Coast). The county's first Courthouse, now a museum, is located here at Civic Center and Broadway streets as is the Dr. Willella Howe-Waffle House and Medical Museum, now the Santa Ana Historical Preservation Society. The county's first theater, Walker's Theater, was built in 1909 on Main and Second streets adjacent to the old City Hall. Today, the Main Street Studio Lofts now stand where the county's first movie house used to be. Old Santa Ana was designated a California Historic Landmark (No.204) on June 20, 1935. Events The prevalence of entrepreneurship, diversity, and a young population (median age of 29.1) have contributed to several weekly, monthly, and annual events. Some of these events include: *1st Saturday Downtown Art Walk *Noche de Altares, largest free day of the dead celebration in California (1st Saturday in November) *Fiesta Patrias (September) *Savor Santa Ana *OC Pride Festival *Viva la Vida *Patchwork Craft Fair *Golden Years Vintage Market *Boca de Oro Arts & Literature Festival *Sound Downtown *The Blading Cup (Every November) Development plans In recent years, efforts have been made to renovate the retail section by continuing to attract new businesses, entrepreneurs, and a creative culture. Officials with The City of Santa Ana have stated that in the coming years they will continue to expand its growth in an effort to compete with adjacent cities looking to capture an audience looking to live in a true downtown setting. Some of these goals include: *Attracting high-end boutique/hotels *Continuing to convert old office buildings (adaptive reuse) to upscale housing and creative office space *Converting parking lots and underutilized properties into ground-up residential projects *Redeveloping the 3rd/Broadway parking structure into a mixed-use (housing or hotel) development *Implementing a streetcar connecting the Santa Ana Regional Transportation Center (SARTC) to Downtown (approved by OCTA and planned to open 2019) *One- Broadway Plaza *Continuing to attract the \\"Creative Class\\" as well as more influential players within the technology industry National historic district The National Register of Historic Places states that the Santa Ana Historical Downtown District is 'roughly bounded' by Civic Center Drive, 1st Street, Ross, & Spurgeon, however, the historic district nomination form does provide a list of contributing properties and detailed maps of the included area. The district consists of two section with a total of 99 buildings that remain from the commercial code of Santa Ana. The buildings date from the late 1870s to the post earthquake reconstructions of 1934. The district is divided into two parts, north and south, due to a break in the historic integrity. .

He is best known for the innovative commentary and literary analysis of The Tale of Genji (Genji monogatari, ca. 1010) found in his work titled Genji monogatari hy≈çshaku (Ê∫êÊ∞èÁâ©Ë™ûË©ïÈáà An Appraisal of Genji ) published in two installments in 1854 and 1861. Life Hiromichi was born on February 19, 1815, in the province of Bizen (what is now the city of Okayama), Japan. He died on December 3, 1863, in Osaka, Japan. (Both dates are according to the lunar calendar used in premodern Japan.) Hiromichi's father, Fujiwara Eizabur≈ç, was a retainer in service to the Okayama feudal lord (daimy≈ç). Hiromichi's name at birth was Fujiwara Keiz≈ç Ëó§ÂéüÈπøËîµ. He adopted the name Hagiwara Hiromichi after relinquishing his status as a samurai and moving to the city of Osaka to pursue a career as a poet and scholar of literature in 1845. He also published works under the literary name (g≈ç) of Nirazono (garlic garden). Hiromichi‚Äôs social status was nominally that of a samurai, but his childhood did not afford the comforts or stability associated with noble birth. Hiromichi‚Äôs father, who received only a meager stipend as a retainer, was plagued by ill health. According to his autobiography, Hiromichi was raised largely in the care of his mother and her family and earned the reputation of being a child prodigy by memorizing the entire Ogura Hyakunin isshu (Collection of 100 poems by 100 poets) at the age of 2. Following the death of his mother in 1821 he returned to live with his father who had taken to supporting himself as a teacher of Confucian classics. Hiromichi‚Äôs childhood fascination with the Hyakunin isshu developed into a lifelong interest in poetry and poetic criticism. At the age of thirteen he was introduced to Hiraga Motoyoshi (1800‚Äì1865) an established poet and avid student of nativist studies. Hiromichi submitted 450 of his own waka poems to Motoyoshi, asking for corrections and advice. This led to an ongoing exchange concerning both poetry and ideology between the two. Hiromichi's extant poems are not similar to the classical Man'y≈çsh≈´ style poems associated with Motoyoshi, but like Motoyoshi, he expressed deep admiration for the work of the leading nativist scholars of his age such as Kamo no Mabuchi and Motoori Norinaga. Hiromichi suffered from palsy in middle-age. Health problems diminished his productivity as a calligrapher and author. An acquaintance remarked that despite severe health problems, Hiromichi's devotion to his work remained equal to that of a Buddhist monk. Hiromichi died in Osaka in 1863, without leaving any disciples or heirs. The Meiji author and scholar Mori ≈ågai includes the description of a solemn visit to Hiromichi's grave in his literary journal Shigarami z≈çshi (the weir; 1889‚Äì94). Works In Osaka Hiromichi taught nativist studies with a focus on classical literature. His poetry and poetic criticism appeared widely in literary publications of the time. He also established an enduring friendship with a fellow Okayama native, Ogata K≈çan (1810-1863), who founded the nation‚Äôs preeminent school of Dutch Learning (Rangaku) and Western medical techniques in Osaka, known as Tekijuku. K√µan invited Hiromichi to his residence to provide instruction in literary studies. Hiromichi‚Äôs interaction with K≈çan and the scholars associated with Tekijuku influenced the course of his scholarship, which stands out among works of premodern criticism for its integration of ideas and techniques from both classical studies and the emerging field of Western Learning. Hiromichi‚Äôs literary taste ranged from classical poetry to popular fiction written in both vernacular Chinese and Japanese. Following the death of Takizawa Bakin, the most widely read author of fiction of his time, Hiromichi was commissioned to write a concluding volume to Bakin‚Äôs unfinished work Daring Adventures of Chivalrous Men (Kaikan ky≈çki ky≈çkakuden; 1832‚Äì35). Hiromichi's close reading of the popular works of Chinese fiction upon which Bakin based his novel and his own interest in literary structure are evident in the way he successfully emulated both Bakin's literary style and the interpretive comments he includes for readers of the novel. In praising ‚Äúthe acuity of Hiromichi‚Äôs command of language and style‚Äù the literary critic K≈çda Rohan observed that Hiromichi‚Äôs concluding volume of Daring Adventures is nearly indistinguishable from the earlier chapters written by the great author himself. Interpreting The Tale of Genji Hiromichi‚Äôs ingenuity and sensitivity to literary style found their ultimate expression in his efforts to make the most revered work of the classical canon, The Tale of Genji, accessible to a wider readership. Having successfully lectured on Genji to a popular audience, he began to raise funds to publish a new edition that incorporated interpretation and revised commentary on the original text in 1851. Undaunted by the well-established views of generations of scholars, Hiromichi chose deliberately simple language to turn the world of Genji commentary and criticism on its head. The introduction to his Genji monogatari hy≈çshaku he explains to readers why this classical text has achieved such renown in the following manner : > The more one reads Genji the more difficult it becomes to express how > exceptional it is‚Ä¶ The text is remarkably detailed and complete. Put simply, > it is written in a way that allows one to scratch in all the places that > itch. Hiromichi focused on textual evidence to substantiate this claim throughout his edition of the text. He argued that the internal consistency of detail and the tale‚Äôs unvarnished depiction of human feeling and behavior give the reader a sense that he or she is engaged with a fictional world as real and compelling as a great theatrical production or life itself. To guide inexperienced readers, allowing them to appreciate Genji with the same sense of satisfaction he had discovered after devoting his life to its study, he devised a new interpretive system. He believed that Genji, or any great work of prose fiction, should be valued for its capacity to engage the imagination of readers from all walks of life. It may seem obvious to contemporary readers that a work of literature should be valued for the ability of its prose to engage the reader‚Äôs imagination, but to critics of the Edo period the claims made by Hiromichi were akin to heresy. His immediate predecessors were deeply invested in establishing Genji‚Äôs importance in relation to Buddhism, Confucianism, and, ultimately, the superiority of Japan‚Äôs indigenous culture (see Kokugaku and Shinto). These interpretive schemes tied the evaluation of Genji as literature to particular moral, ideological, or cultural values. Following in the footsteps of the greatest scholar of nativist studies of the Edo period, Motoori Norinaga (1730-1801), Hiromichi, did much to promote scholarship on Genji. Unlike Norinaga and his influential thesis regarding the affective, or mono no aware oriented approach to reading Genji, however, Hiromichi's interpretation ultimately rested on the internal consistency and literary style of the text, not ideological argument. The first two installments of Hiromichi's commentary were well received and widely reprinted, but only for a brief period. After seeing the publication of the first two volumes of his magnum opus on Genji to print, including the carving of woodblock prints himself, Hiromichi succumbed to protracted illness and died in 1863, leaving his greatest work incomplete. Only five years after Hiromichi‚Äôs death, the Tokugawa Shogunate collapsed and the Meiji restoration began. Politicians and academics devoted to modernizing Japan in the Meiji period (1868-1912) sought to revive the nativist rhetoric associated with Genji in the Edo period. Almost immediately, the ideas Hiromichi had used to liberate Genji from the limitations of premodern ideology became a liability while those promoted by Norinaga were easily tailored to serve the needs of scholars and politicians eager to advance both nativism and nationalism. To this day Hiromichi's work remains in the shadow of interpretations that point to Genji as an icon of national culture. Evidence of Hiromichi's innovative scholarship can be found in Tsubouchi Sh≈çy≈ç's seminal treatise The Essence of the novel (Sh≈çsetsu shinzui, 1885). While Sh≈çy≈ç makes no explicit reference to Hiromichi, his treatise, shows the influence of Hiromichi's theories on Genji, mono no aware, and the elaboration of Bakin's views concerning Edo popular fiction (sh≈çsetsu Â∞èË™¨ ) that appear in texts written by Hiromichi.

Dillwynia retorta, commonly known as eggs and bacon, is a species of flowering plant shrub in the family Fabaceae and grows in New South Wales and Queensland. It is usually an erect shrub with thin, smooth, crowded leaves and yellow flowers with red markings. Description Dillwynia retorta is a small, upright shrub to high, with stems covered in short, erect, soft hairs or soft, weak, thin, separated hairs. The leaves are narrowly oblong to linear, about long, spirally twisted, needle-like, smooth or minutely warty, tapering at the apex and sometimes curved.

The School of Science is the nickname given to the complex by some supporters, referring to a long-standing nickname for the club. The training ground houses both the Everton men and women's first team and the youth academy. The first team squad officially moved to the complex on 9 October 2007, some time behind the target date of pre-season. Plans were drawn up for the Cheshire County Council owned site in 2002. Background Everton originally tried to find land in Liverpool but eventually settled on the site, off Higher Road and Finch Lane in Halewood. Some Halewood residents fought the plans as the training complex and academy was built on greenbelt land. USM Finch Farm was acquired in 2006 by Everton who later sold the land on for ¬£2.1 million and then had it developed to the club‚Äôs specification by developers ROM Capital (an arm of the aAim Group) who as of March 2010 are known as Hudson Capital Properties. USM Finch Farm was designed by North-West-based architects AFL. The contract was valued at ¬£9million. A site worker was killed during the final stages of development. On completion, USM Finch Farm was valued by ROM Capital at ¬£17 M. Everton signed a 50-year tenancy agreement with ROM Capital for USM Finch Farm. Everton have an option to purchase the site every 5 years. Between the 2006/07 and 2007/08 financial accounts' \\"Other Operating Costs\\" increased significantly from ¬£11.7m to ¬£21.1m. The club largely attributed this rise to USM Finch Farm in the club's Financial Review in the annual report: \\"Further significant increases in operating costs were also incurred in the year following the opening of the new USM Finch Farm training facility. The additional operating costs compared with those incurred at Bellefield are seen as a necessary investment to provide the appropriate training facilities required by both first team players and academy players at a Premier League club of Everton‚Äôs standing.\\" In October 2011, Hudson Capital Properties put USM Finch Farm on sale, the asking price was ¬£15.3million. It was sold in May 2013 to Liverpool City Council for ¬£12.9million. On 8 July 2016, Liverpool City Council announced that ¬£4m will be spent on improvements on the training grounds. Although the council sees this investment to be a good move; the move is facing many criticism because there is a lack of information about the investment and also many have questioned the use of tax-payer's money.  Structure and facilities  The facility boasts some of the finest training facilities in the world, and features 10 full-size grass pitches on three plateaus, one of which is a floodlit along with an additional floodlit synthetic pitch and specialist training areas for fitness work and goalkeepers, as well as an exact recreation of the pitch at Goodison Park. Inside the training complex there are extensive changing facilities for both the senior squad and the Academy players. The state-of-the-art facilities on offer will arguably make Everton a big draw for future signings and should also provide a boost in the development of the club's Academy players, with the facilities including the following: *Gym *Synthetic indoor training pitch *Hydrotherapy pools *Spa *Sauna *Physiotherapy rooms *Media centre *Video lounges including a video editing suite  Gallery  Image:Everton_academy.jpgPlan of new academy in Halewood  References  External links  * The Everton Way - Everton Academy Online * Everton Shareholds Association - are given tour of Finch Farm * - The School of Science * Information about the academy from ToffeeWeb * Discussions about the youth teams, results and the future stars from ToffeeTalk * PitchCare Magazine Article Category:Everton F.C.

From 1977 onwards majorland reforms took place in West Bengal. Land in excess of land ceiling was acquired and distributed amongst the peasants. In Birbhum district, 19,968 hectares of vested agricultural land has been distributed amongst 161,515 beneficiaries, till 2011. However, more than 38% of the operational land holding is marginal or less than 1 acre.

Bakreshwar Thermal Power Station is the only large-scale industry in the district and employs about 5,000 people. There are 4 medium-scale industries and 4,748 registered small-scale industries. The proportion of workers engaged in agriculture in Birbhum has been decreasing. According to the District Human Development Report, ‚Äúmore people are now engaged in non-agricultural activities, such as fishing, retail sales, vegetable vending, selling milk, and so on. As all these activities are at the lower end of the spectrum of marketable skills, it remains doubtful if these activities generate enough return for their family‚Äôs sustenance.‚Äù Backward Regions Grant Fund Birbhum district is listed as a backward region and receives financial support from the Backward Regions Grant Fund. The fund, created by the Government of India, is designed to redress regional imbalances in development. As of 2012, 272 districts across the country were listed under this scheme.

S. Ravikumar written with Kamal Haasan and Crazy Mohan. The film features Haasan, Simran and Ramya Krishnan leading an ensemble cast that includes Jayaram, Ramesh Aravind, Sriman, Yugi Sethu, Urvashi, Aishwarya and Nagesh. Dialogues were written by Crazy Mohan. The film opened to positive reviews from critics, and became a commercial success at the box office. The 2013 Punjabi film Lucky Di Unlucky Story was inspired from Panchatanthiram. Jayaram won Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor ‚Äì Tamil at the 50th South Filmfare Awards in 2003.  Plot  Ramachandramurthy alias Ram. C. M. is a Canada-based Indian pilot and a womaniser. In the course of an aircraft hijacking, he meets passenger Mythili. Ram and Mythili stop the hijacking and save the passengers. Soon after, they fall in love and get married. Ram's four closest friends, Ayyapan Nair, Vedhantham Iyer, Ganesh Hegde and Hanumant Reddy attend the wedding. After marriage, Ram quits his playboy character and remains faithful to Mythili. One day, when Ram prevents Hegde's ex-girlfriend, Nirmala, from committing suicide, Mythili misinterprets the situation. She presumes that he is having an affair with her and leaves him to be with her parents. Further misunderstanding occurs when he sets out to meet Mythili, drunk, in the middle of the night and enters the wrong house. To take his mind off Mythili for a while, Ram's four friends drive him down to Bangalore and rent a room to hire call girl Maragathavalli alias Maggie. Ram, who is still not able to forget Mythili and does not wish to betray her, gets into a fight with Maggie. To salvage the situation, Iyer hurries back to Maggie's room, only to find Maggie dead. Panicking, Nair, Iyer, Hegde and Reddy decide to discreetly dispose of the body in spite of Ram's pleas to call the police. They manage to roll the body in a blanket, dispose it in a dry river and drive back to Chennai to return to their normal lives. Ram discovers a cache of diamonds inside Maggie's mobile phone. He does not report about it to the police, fearing he would be arrested for murdering Maggie, which he did not commit. A few days after, the friends get very nervous when they learn of a news article regarding the discovery of a corpse in the same area where they disposed Maggie's body. At that time, the wives of Ram's four friends plan to unite Ram and Mythili by holding a party on the traditional festival of Ugadi. The wives invite Mythili to the party to be reunited with Ram. At the party, Maggie appears, demanding her diamonds back. Maggie then reveals the truth behind her death. The diamonds belong to a smuggler, and that she stole it from him for her own personal gain. She chose to merely fake her death as she realised that the diamonds would be temporarily safe in Ram's possession. She also blackmails Ram that she would reveal about their rendezvous in Bangalore to Mythili if he does not give the diamonds back. The smuggler then arrives and kidnaps Maggie, Ram and his friends. Mythili spots Ram and Maggie together. She again believes that Ram has not changed his ways. Mythili, along with an undercover police inspector, follows them. While the smuggler demands his diamonds back, Mythili appears. Upon seeing Ram and Maggie together, she believes that Ram is having fun with Maggie along with his friends, when in reality Ram, Maggie and his friends are kidnapped and tied up by the smuggler. She swallows some sleeping pills, which turns out to be where Ram hid the diamonds. Mythili decides to commit suicide and runs away. Ram and his friends save her and help the undercover police inspector arrest Maggie and the smuggler. Mythili, on being informed by Ram of all that happened, promises to reform her suspicious ways.

Thenappan, and the team initially planned a film starring Kamal Haasan with music composed by A. R. Rahman. Though recordings had taken place, Thenappan became apprehensive of the budget and chose to make a smaller budget film, meaning Deva replaced Rahman. Hence Panchathanthiram, a comedy about five friends, materialised instead. Originally Krishnamachari Srikkanth was supposed to essay the role later played by Yugi Sethu, but dropped out.https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/videos/entertainment/regional/tamil/krish- srikkanth-missed-chances-to-act-with-kamal-haasan/videoshow/73664196.cms Sethu signed on revealing that Kamal Haasan had approached him to be a part of his two previous films, Thenali (2000) and Pammal K. Sambandam (2002) too, which he did not take up. Simran was signed after appearing alongside Kamal Haasan in Pammal K. Sambandam, with which the latter was impressed. The film started shoot in February 2002 and shot in Canada for seventeen days. In April 2002, Kamal Haasan was prevented from boarding a Los Angeles-bound flight in Toronto during the making of the film, with the security preventing him from passing due to his Islamic-sounding surname. In June 2002, the five friends in the film along with Deva took part in a promotional tour to publicise the soundtrack in Bangalore. The film faced trouble during censorship and parts of a song featuring Ramya Krishnan were subsequently cut.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack of the film was composed by Deva, with lyrics written by Vairamuthu. The song \\"Vai Raja Vai\\" incorporates lyrics from the Hindi song \\"Aana Meri Jaan\\" from Shehnai (1947), while \\"Manmatha Leelai\\" was partly influenced by Linkin Park's \\"Points of Authority\\".  Release  The film opened to positive reviews from critics, with the critic from The Hindu citing that Crazy Mohan's dialogue was \\"the mainstay\\", describing the film as \\"completely entertaining\\". The reviewer also praised the film's performances claiming that \\"with suitable slapstick, apt body language and timing and modulation that tickle, the veteran (Kamal Haasan) makes a mark yet again.\\" Furthermore, reviewers from Screen magazine dubbed the film as a \\"clean comic- entertainer\\", adding that \\"director KS Ravikumar deserves a pat for weaving out a good screenplay based on Kamal Haasan's story idea and creating a laugh riot\\". Tulika of Rediff labelled the film as \\"a barrel of laughs\\". The film was blockbuster and remained classic cult in comedy genre. Kamal Haasan distributed the film himself in the Karnataka region. A sequel to the film was planned and Ravikumar had hoped to film scenes on a cruise liner, but the project failed to take off. Elements from the proposed sequel were, however, used in Ravikumar's 2010 directorial film Manmadan Ambu, which also featured Haasan. This film met with mixed reviews and was an average grosser.

Some 1,557 units were produced from September 1970 to December 1971 with 300 GTHO Phase IIIs produced from May 1971 to November 1971. It was the fourth in the initial series of the Ford Falcon GT. A limited number were exported to South Africa, wearing Fairmont GT badging. The Fairmont GT model is starting to increase in value as Falcon GTs become harder to find and buyers beginning to see the Fairmont as a genuine GT. With the rev limiter disabled it is capable of and can exceed 7,500rpm (at high risk of engine failure) in fourth gear. The rev limiter is set to 6,150rpm.

It was also equipped with special brakes and handling package, plus a fuel tank. Winner of the 1971 Bathurst 500, driven by Allan Moffat, the Phase III has been described as \\"...simply one of the best cars in the world, a true GT that could take on Ferraris and Astons on their own terms...\\" by Sports Car World.Quote mentioned at eBay's Australia's Muscle & Performance Cars Buying Guide The GTHO's 351 Cleveland engine output was understated as 300 bhp (224 kW) to satisfy insurers. It is generally accepted to produce in the region of 350-380 bhp (265 kW -283 kW). Initial cars were equipped with an electrical rev limiter which came into effect at 6,150 rpm. With the rev limiter disabled, the engine was reputed to pull in excess of 7,000 rpm, even in fourth gear. At that time the Phase III GTHO was the world's fastest four-door production car. Performance: Top speed: 228 km/h (142 mph) @ 6150rpm 0 - 60 mph - 6.4 seconds 0 ‚Äì 100 km - 6.9 seconds Standing 1/4 mile (400m) - 14.4 seconds using the standard 3.25:1 Detroit Locker diff ratio. An optional 3.9:1 ratio differential was available and reputedly enabled such cars to cover the 1/4 mile in 13.9 seconds. Bathurst (6.172 km - 1938-1986) (6.213 km - 1987-present) fastest lap time: 2:36.5 by Allan Moffat (1972 Hardie-Ferodo 500 - Ford Falcon XY GTHO Phase III) Value The Phase III GTHO is in incredibly high demand with collectors and investors. Good examples have been sold for prices in excess of A$ 1,000,000. This demand is, in part, due to a small production run, and 'fewer than 100 remaining' examples of the GTHO.Joshua Dowling, The Sun-Herald, 3 June 2007, p. 13 A Falcon XY GTHO Phase III was sold at by Bonhams & Goodmans at auction for A$683,650 in March 2007. The car had only 40,000 km on the clock. The buyer of the car said it will be garaged, and that it will not be driven, but that he will be \\"keeping it as an investment\\". The sale price set a new auction record for Australian sport sedans. Whilst in June 2007 another Phase III sold for A$750,000. The Australian sports sedan record has been hit out of the park with a seven-figure price paid for a Ford Falcon GTHO Phase III on June 17, 2018 once owned by Australian fast bowler Jeff Thomson. Lloyds Auctions sold the pristine and provenanced car for $1,030,000 at its weekend auction in Bathurst NSW.https://www.finder.com.au/ford-gtho-sells- for-1-million Race record The Falcon GTHO Phase III succeeded in an outright win at Bathurst in the 1971 Hardie-Ferodo 500 and also secured the 1973 Australian Touring Car Championship (ATCC) title; in both instances the cars were driven by Allan Moffat. Ian \\"Pete\\" Geoghegan and Moffat had great success with the Phase III in Australian production touring car racing where it scored many race wins from the latter half of 1971 through to 1973. One of the Phase IIIs driven by Moffat is now owned by Bowden's Own, an Australian car care products company. This particular example was a replacement vehicle fettled in September 1972, the original 1971 Bathurst winning car having been badly damaged at Adelaide International Raceway in the opening round of the 1972 Australian Manufacturers Championship; this particular GTHO was subsequently driven to a number of victories by Moffat and enabled him to secure the overall 1973 ATCC honours. In 1970, the Ford Works Team under the direction of team manager Al Turner, built two \\"Super Falcons\\" using the XW GTHO Phase II as the basis for the cars. Ford looked to translate the work that had gone into the Ford Mustang Boss 302 into the local Falcon model with the car using a fuel injected and much higher developed Cleveland V8 engine. According to those who drove the cars (Alan Moffat, Ian Geoghegan and John French), the Super Falcon's biggest problem was that the the engine produced was simply too much for the light weight chassis to handle and power oversteer was the order of the day. Turner initially did not believe Moffat when he told him this, believing that the car was simply being driven wrong. At the Mallala Circuit in South Australia, Moffat took Turner for a lap of the circuit in his Falcon in a successful bid to show the team boss what the car was really like to drive. Moffat virtually abandoned the Super Falcon in the 1971 and 1972 ATCCs (which by this time had been upgraded with XY bodywork) in favour of his better handling Boss 302 Mustang. In 1972, Geoghegan went the opposite way and abandoned his own well developed Ford Mustang GTA to drive his Falcon. After fixing the problem with the chassis, Geoghegan was able to get the best out of the car and won a memorable third round of the 1972 ATCC at the Mount Panorama Circuit after a long race with the Mustang of Moffat. The race is often seen as the best in the ATCC's history. *1st 1971 Hardie-Ferodo 500 at Mount Panorama *1st 1971 Australian Manufacturers' Championship, round five at Surfers Paradise *1st 1972 South Pacific Touring Series *1st 1972 Australian Touring Car Championship, round three, Mount Panorama *1st 1972 Australian Manufacturers' Championship, round two, Sandown Park (1972 Sandown 250) *1st 1972 Australian Manufacturers' Championship, round four, Phillip Island *1st 1972 Australian Manufacturers' Championship, round five, Surfers Paradise *1st 1973 Australian Touring Car Championship, round one, Symmons Plains *1st 1973 Australian Touring Car Championship, round two, Calder Park *1st 1973 Australian Touring Car Championship, round three, Sandown Park *1st 1973 Australian Touring Car Championship, round four, Wanneroo Park *1st 1973 Australian Touring Car Championship, round seven, Oran Park Successor to the GTHO Phase III In 1972, the XY series Falcon was replaced by the XA Falcon range. Production of approximately 200 XA-based Falcon GT-HO Phase IV cars was originally scheduled to take place in June and July 1972, but this was terminated at 'the eleventh hour' due to what became known as \\"the supercar scare\\". The Sun-Herald newspaper had run this as a front page lead article (with banner headline in large capital letters) on Sunday 25 June 1972: \\"160mph 'super cars' soon\\". A copy of that front page is shown at the start of a Phase IV documentary.The documentary at www.gtho4.com Only one road vehicle had been completed when production was cancelled. Three standard GTs were being converted into GT-HOs by the Ford factory race team for the Sandown 500 in September and Bathurst 500 in October 1972. Only one of these racers was ever completed and the other two were finished after being sold or given to specific individuals or dealers by Ford Australia. The Phase IV was never officially released.\\"The Final Finest Phase\\" article in Super Ford magazine, 1987, pp. 20-27 ReferencesExternal links *The Falcon XY GT Club *Falcon GT Club *www.gtho4.com *Supercars.net forum *http://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/picture-special-history-maserati- quattroporte Category:1970s cars Category:Cars of Australia GT XY Category:Sports sedans Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Cars introduced in 1971 ","title":"Ford XY Falcon GT"},{"id":"13386184","title":"Choke exchange"},{"id":"13386200","text":"\\"Body\\" is a 2007 single by American rapper Ja Rule.

Filming locations included Stockholm for studio interiors and the openings sequence, while Sk√•ne County in Sweden and √Örhus in Jutland represented Nagijala, while and Dimmuborgir in Iceland represented the lands of Tengil. Upon release, unique for adaptions of Lindgren‚Äôs work, it was given a 11 certificate by the Swedish board of censors, causing the Riksdag to enact an age limit of 7 and above for future films. The film nevertheless maintained the age limit of 11 and above for years until a 7 limit, called ‚ÄúLex Lejonhj√§rta‚Äù, was deemed acceptable. The source work is widely considered, although the violent content is much toned down on screen, the most political and violent of Lindgren‚Äôs books, involving themes of dictatorship, occupation, treason, democide, war, suicide and forced labour of nigh-Holocaustian reminiscence. Most of the named characters do not survive the film (although its setting in concurrent realities soften this fact). In a cruel quirk of fate, actor Folke Hjort drowned in a diving accident less than three months before its release, a fate shared with his character in the film and book. Nevertheless, it has maintained its place as one of the most beloved and iconic adaptions, and films overall, although several technical aspects, such as the Katla model, are considered well out of date, and several lines from the film are widely culturally understood and in widespread use, such as ‚ÄúAll power to Tengil, our liberator!‚Äù (in original Swedish: All makt √•t Tengil, v√•r befriare!), a truism (used ironically out of context) pronounced to proclaim loyalty and submission to the autocratic occupational power of Lord Tengil of Karmanjaka. Reception=Box office In Sweden, the film grossed SEK 8,963,000 at the box office. Its screenings were attended by 553,000 people. Differences from the novel Although the film mostly stays true to the book some notable differences can be seen. *In the novel Hubert is described having long, curly red hair and a big, bristly beard, while actor Tommy Johnson had short, normal red hair and a moustache. *In the novel, Jonatan rescues one of Tengil's soldiers who is later killed in the battle. This soldier does not appear in the film. *In the book when Karl tries to find Jonatan one night, he stays in a cave where he suddenly gets surrounded by angry wolves but is quickly saved by Hubert. This is omitted in the film. *In the book Jossi tells Veder and Kader about Karl after getting the \\"Katla mark\\" on his chest. In the film when he arrives, he tells them before getting labeled with the mark. *In the novel the \\"Katla mark\\" is a dragonhead. It was a flame in the film. *Veder and Kader's fate is not shown. In the book they are killed by Orvar and Sofia. *In the book, Mattias dies at some point during the final battle against Tengil's forces. In the film, he is killed by a thrown spear before the battle starts after one of Tengil's men sees him release a white dove carrying a message to Orvar. *Karm, the lindworm is omitted completely. Karm is described in the novel as Katla's enemy and that he has been around since the dawn of time awaiting the moment he will get to kill Katla. As he is restricted to water and Katla to land, this has been impossible until Jonatan pushes a rock onto Katla, making her fall into the Karma Falls. In the film, Katla is simply knocked over a ledge by the rock dislodged by Jonatan and perishes in a pool of lava. *The ending is softened a bit and does not explicitly show the brothers committing suicide. Critical response The film was well received by Swedish critics. Often interpreting the film in contemporary terms, they compared Staffan G√∂testam's portrayal of Jonatan to Che Guevara, and Georg √Örlin's portrayal of Tengil to Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin, Augusto Pinochet, Richard Nixon and Saddam Hussein.

He has been a member of Aosd√°na, the Irish state-supported academy of creative artists, since 1986. Besides his music, Raymond Deane is known for his social commitment and human rights activism, particularly for the Ireland‚ÄìPalestine Solidarity Campaign (IPSC), which he co-founded in 2001, and the Irish Anti-War Movement. He cited early experiences of bullying in his childhood as a potential cause of this commitment: \\"[...] I have internalised the certainty that this bullying was a defining factor in my personal growth, eventually leading to my sporadic activism on behalf of the downtrodden\\".Deane (2014), p. 50‚Äì51. Deane has always been active as a writer of essays and critic on music, having published in Irish journals such as \\"In Dublin\\", \\"Soundpost\\", the \\"Journal of Music in Ireland\\" and in some academic books.

Several works of his middle phase are consciously constructed in a technical manner to avoid the trend towards neo- romanticism that he perceived among many of his contemporaries. According to Fitzgerald, \\"Deane strives to achieve a dialectical drama without regressing to nineteenth-century norms of developmentalism. The result is a heterogeneous and impure dramatic discourse.\\"Fitzgerald (2013), p. 290. Zuk wrote, \\"Even at first hearing, it is evident that his work is a product of a highly reflective mind, being for the most part intensely serious in tone, though shot through at times with an idiosyncratic humour and on other occasions pervaded by a distinct spirit of playfulness\\".Zuk (2006), p. 6.

It has been an official city holiday since 1871, when the local government first organized a program of special activities to observe the Roman Catholic feast day of Our Lady of Mercy, La Mare de D√©u de la Merc√® in Catalan. Although the actual feast day is September 24, the festivities begin a few days beforehand. Some of the most important features of the festival were introduced in the year 1902, when parades included papier mach√© ‚Äúgiants‚Äù known as gegants i capgrossos and a popular dance from Empord√† that was becoming popular throughout Catalonia: the Sardana. The holiday has enjoyed immense local popularity ever since. Among more recently introduced traditions are the annual Catalan Wine Fair, a special correfoc, a 10 km race and the pyro-musical, a display featuring synchronized fireworks, water fountains and music conducted at the base of the Montju√Øc mountain. History The celebration of La Merc√® has religious origins, honoring the Virgin of Grace (Mare de D√©u de la Merc√®), patron saint of the archdiocese of Barcelona, and co-patroness‚Äîalong with Saint Eul√†lia‚Äîof the city. In Catalan, the word merc√® has meanings related to service, help, a sense of compassion, and loving mercy. In the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona, there is a basilica dedicated to the Virgin, where a wooden image of her is venerated. The festival has been celebrated since the Middle Ages when, in 1687, Barcelona suffered a plague of locusts. To fight against insects, the Consell de Cent, which then governed the city, voted to ask the Virgin's assistance. When the city was delivered from the pestilence, she was named patroness of the city of Barcelona‚Äî although this was only recognized by the Pope in 1868. Since that time, an annual festival has been celebrated in the city in honor of the Virgin. Activities Castellers de Barcelona during La Merc√® 2001 During the week-long festival, close to two million people attend cultural and artistic presentations held throughout the city. The most traditional activities of the festival are based in the popular culture of Catalonia. Especially noteworthy are the street parades, originating from the spectacular processions which took place centuries ago for the celebration of Corpus Christi. Each day of the festival is celebrated with its own parade filled with mythical characters and traditional drumming. There are about 600 events spread throughout the plazas, streets, museums, and parks. All entertainment is free. \\"Les Festes de La Merc√®\\", Fest 300 Barcelona's metro trains run all night during the festival. Street theater is a distinct element of the artistic events. Dance, circus, bands, fringe, and touring shows make up the bulk of the events. In order to bring Barcelona‚Äôs people closer to different cultures, each year, through the \\"Guest City\\" program, another city from elsewhere in the world is invited to present its culture and artists. In 2013 the Guest City was Vienna. Castellers Castellers are human towers and a prominent part of La Merc√®\\"La Merce\\" rove.me. Castells, Catalan for castles, are a cultural phenomenon particular to Catalonia and consist of erecting human towers. This tradition originated at the end of the 18th century in Valls, Province of Tarragona, when rival groups of people called colles began to compete in constructing the different kinds of human towers.Castellers de Barcelona ReferencesExternal links * La Merc√®, Official Website Merce Category:Public holidays in Spain Category:Culture in Barcelona Category:October observances Category:Autumn events in Spain ","title":"La Merc√®"},{"id":"13386429","text":"Kanaya-juku in the 1830s, as depicted by Hiroshige in The Fifty-three Stations of the T≈çkaid≈ç Hokusai was the twenty-fourth of the fifty-three stations of the T≈çkaid≈ç.

It has traditionally been the seat of the Druk Desi (or \\"Deb Raja\\"), the head of Bhutan's civil government, an office which has been combined with the kingship since the creation of the monarchy in 1907, and summer capital of the country.Earl of Ronaldshay (1923). Lands of the Thunderbolt: Sikhim, Chumbi & Bhutan, p. 242. Reprinted: 1987. Snow Lion Graphics. Berkeley, California. ; (pbk). In old British documents, it is known as Tassisudon. The main structure of the whitewashed building is two-storied with three-storied towers at each of the four corners topped by triple-tiered golden roofs. There is also a large central tower or utse. History The original Thimphu dzong (the Do- Ng√∂n Dzong, or Blue Stone Dzong) was built in 1216 by Lama Gyalwa Lhanapa (1164-1224), founder of the Lhapa branch of the Drikung Kagyu, at the place where Dechen Phodrang Monastery now stands on a ridge above the present Tashich√∂-dzong. In 1641 Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal took over that Dzong from the Lhapa Kagyu, reconsecrated, and renamed it Tashich√∂-Dzong. It was then established as the main seat of the Southern Drukpa Kagyu and the summer residence of the monastic body or sangha headed by Shabdrung Rinpoche. Most of this original dzong was destroyed by fire in 1772 and a new dzong was built at the present site by the sixteenth Desi, Sonam Lhudrup, and it was then consecrated by the thirteenth Je Khenpo, Je Yonten Taye, who named the new Dzong Sonamch√∂-dzong. Following the death of the Desi it was renamed Tashich√∂- dzong after the old Dzong. Tashich√∂ Dzong was again destroyed by fire three different times as well seriously damaged by an earthquake. Each time it was rebuilt by the Desi and Je Khenpo of the time. In 1962, after the capital was moved from Punakha to Thimphu, the present Dzong was rebuilt by the third king, Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, as the seat of Government following a different plan from the old one. Only the central Utse tower, the Lhakhang Sarp (new temple), and main G√∂nkhang (protector temple) remain from the earlier Dzong. After its completion in 1968, the new Tashich√∂ Dzong was consecrated by the 66th Je Khenpo Yonten Tarchin; the 16th Karmapa, Rangjung Rigpai Dorje; and Je Kudre, Jamyang Yeshe. Tashich√∂ Dzong has been the seat of Bhutan's government since 1968. It presently houses the throne room and offices of the king, the cabinet secretariat and the ministries of home affairs and finance. Some other government departments are housed in buildings to the south of the Dzong, and others in new buildings in Thimphu. West of the dzong is a small tower of Ney Khang Lhakhang which houses a statue of Shakyamuni Buddha and protective deities.Whitecross, Richard (2007). Bhutan (Country Guide). Lonely Planet. .Geckogo In 1953 the royal family took up residence in the newly built Dechencholing Palace.

Biography Born in Cleveland, Ohio, Robert moved to Plainfield, Vermont in 1946, and began attending Goddard College. It took him eight years to finish his degree, as he worked his way through college. Robert's degree thesis at Goddard was on international communities. He was not yet painting seriously until moving to New York City, where he was offered the opportunity to work with Hans Hofmann at his New York School. In the 1950s and early 1960s Robert received two large commissions to work for other sculptors, Ibram Lassaw (one of the founders of the Abstract Artists Association) and Herbert Ferber. He went on to produce welded sculptures of his own, exhibiting in juried shows, selling, and receiving commissions, notably for a \\"...large stainless steel piece in which the mirror finish ... picked up the reflected the colors of the sun and fall leaves.\\"interview printed in \\"The Middlesex Newspaper,\\" Vol. 18 No. 4, April 2007, published for the town of Middlesex, Vermont Robert considered this \\"...to be a piece using modern techniques and materials, yet following the ancient polychromatic form of the Greeks and Egyptians.\\" Mid-1960s, Robert moved back to Vermont permanently, so he could live less expensively and thus devote more time to creative endeavors. That did not stop him from getting involved in the Civil Rights Movement. By the end of the 60's, he spent a total of two years working in Mississippi, most of it helping develop cooperatives for low income people. He continued such community work until his death, mostly working with groups serving low income families and children, and organizations helping the families of those in prison. One example of such ongoing outreach work is \\"Street Angel Diaries.\\" Robert donated the rights to use \\"about thirty\\" of his paintings of street people to help raise awareness of the plight of the homeless. \\"Street Angels\\" is a multimedia project first presented in 2005 in Los Angeles, to great critical acclaim. In 2006, the program was presented eight times at the Boston Court Theater in Pasadena, CA, and in 2007 in Cape Cod. Robert had \\"...been doing paintings of street people on and off for many years.\\" Through the 1970s and up to 1986, Robert produced shows in Vermont and on the Cape, received commissions for welded sculpture, taught at the University of Vermont and at Goddard College, and continued to work in charcoal, oils, and watercolor. In autumn 1986, this rhythm was disrupted when Robert fell from a scaffold upon which he was painting and broke his back. Roberts was not paralyzed from the fall due to the then experimental spinal clip procedure, seven weeks in hospital and six months in a full upper body cast. He was able to return to work, but it was almost a decade before he regained full mobility, and he never did regain his former vigor. In 2000, PBS aired nationally a documentary \\"Hans Hoffmann: artist/teacher, teacher/artist,\\" directed by Madeline Amgout and narrated by Robert De Niro. Robert Fisher appeared in the program five times, and tried to offer to the audience \\"...some idea of the humor and joy (Hans) brought to his teaching.\\" Robert was working on a number of projects at the time of his death. One was a proposed book about Ibram Lassaw, William, and Hans Hofmann and their major role in helping America become aware of and accept non-objective modern art, working with Ibram's daughter Denise. He had photos of the men that have never appeared in print, and was planning to include them in the book. Another project was tentatively titled \\"Ancient Bottle, New Wine: The Impact of Hans Hofmann and His New York City Mosaic Murals on the World of Modern Art.\\" The Hofmann murals (on 711 Third Avenue and on West 49th) consumed a year of Han's creative life, yet are largely overlooked despite their providing an enlightening window into his theory of \\"Pure Color.\\" Robert stated that \\"... as important to me as Hofmann's artistic theories and techniques were, perhaps even more crucial was one of Hofmann's stellar statements, that \\"There are a thousand talents in the world, but it takes work to become an artist.\\" In times when there seemed to be reason to be discouraged with my choice of following his path of work, his words left me not overly disturbed at lack of either recognition or of great leaps of progression.\\" Works Fisher's work has been exhibited in New York, Provincetown, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, where his series on \\"Street Angels\\" was well received. Some other notable exhibits include \\"USA on Paper,\\" Copenhagen (1990), a traveling show in the Czech Republic (Gallery Zouf and Friends, 1993), and his last show, \\"\\" (Gallery, Burlington, Vermont). His works are part of the permanent collection in the Cape Cod Museum of Art in Dennis Massachusetts, and in and Provincetown Museum.

With financial help from his friends, he was able to continue his education. Arasu, his drawing master at the American College Higher Secondary School, taught him the skills. Professor Jothi Muthu of American College groomed his love for the language. Pappiah joined Thiagarajar College to pursue post-graduation in Tamil and became the first batch of MA Tamil students. He entered the public stage fray in 1960, while he was a lecturer at The American College. He rose to the position of Head of Department for Tamil in American college and extended his Tamil literature knowledge to all people through various forums. Eventually, he created a social awakening in the evolution of Patti Mandrams. He has also written and directed plays at college. Speaking style Pappaiah is known for his ‚Äòdown to earth' speaking style. His command of Tamil enables him to get complex literary issues across to the common man. This has enabled him to take social themes to the masses and bring about a social awakening in the evolution of Patti Mandrams in Tamil Nadu and beyond.

The song serves as the opening theme for the first three seasons of the original Power Rangers series Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. The song, with minor alterations of its lyrics, was also used for the mini-series Alien Rangers. The titular refrain, \\"Go Go Power Rangers!\\", has become a popular catchphrase associated with the show, and it has been used in several other themes for the series. The instrumental track was originally written for use in X-Men but never used, then chosen among available tracks for Power Rangers. The lyrics and melody were then added. A long version was also produced for the album. A cover of the song, performed by Noam Kaniel, has been used as the show's intro theme since 2011, starting with the 18th season of the franchise, Power Rangers Samurai. A rearrangement of Kaniel's version was used for 2013's Power Rangers Megaforce, revising some lyrics to reflect that season.

Pre-game activities On October 22, 1991, the Tournament of Roses selected 17-year-old Tannis Ann Turrentine, a senior at Mayfield Senior School and a resident of Pasadena, as the 74th Rose Queen of the 103rd Tournament of Roses.

Game summary After a scoreless first quarter, a 7‚Äì7 tie in the second, and 13-7 Husky advantage at halftime, the 1992 game became the most lopsided contest between two top-5 teams in Rose Bowl history. Trailing 34-7, a late Michigan touchdown against Husky reserves closed the gap in the final score to 20 points.Rose Bowl history.org - 1992 game With a minute remaining and the third-string quarterback leading the offense, Washington opted to run out the clock from the Michigan five-yard line, rather than run up the score. This was the first Rose Bowl since the beginning of the Big Ten‚ÄìPacific 10 (originally the Pacific Coast Conference) contract that officials from a neutral conference (in this case, the Southeastern Conference) were used. From 1947 through 1991, a split crew of Big Ten and Pac-10 (Pac-8/AAWU/PCC; now Pac-12) officials were used. From 1984, the first year a seven-man officiating crew was used, through 1991, the conference of the designated home team provided the referee, back judge, one wing official on the line of scrimmage (head linesman or line judge) and one deep wing official (field judge or side judge), and the other conference provided the umpire, one wing official on the line of scrimmage and one deep wing official. The Rose Bowl was the last bowl to use split officiating crews; most bowl games abandoned them in favor of neutral officials in the 1970s, although the Orange Bowl used a split crew from the SEC and Big Ten for its 1978 game. Split crews were banned by the NCAA starting in 1999.

The story is about a narrator in 1979 remembering the events that happened when he was 13 in 1948. The young narrator lives in a lower class suburban Oregon neighborhood and collects beer bottles or does favors for neighbors to earn money. He also spends time alone fishing in a pond on the outskirts of town. Instead of buying a hamburger at a local diner, he buys bullets from the gunshop across the street. The book starts with this, and then hovers and builds around this event until the end. While shooting rotten apples at an abandoned orchard with a friend, the narrator accidentally shoots the friend and kills him. Because the shooting was an accident he is acquitted, but because of his ruined reputation, his waitress mother doesn't get tips anymore, he is severely bullied at school, and they are forced to move to another town where the event is not known. The book ends with a return to an observation of two obese people fishing in a temporarily set up \\"living room\\" by the pond. Most of the book is made up of observations of the different strange characters that surrounded the narrator when he was a child. The novel presents a wistful, poetic and many times sad perspective on a life, some of it being on Brautigan's own. The tone can be described as being saturated with feeling and sublime in its bittersweetness ‚Äì demonstrated in this quote from the end of the novel: :\\"I had become so quiet and so small in the grass by the pond that I was barely noticeable, hardly there‚Ä¶ I sat there watching their living room shining out of the dark beside the pond. It looked like a fairy-tale functioning happily in the post-World War II gothic of America before television crippled the imagination and turned people indoors and away from living out their own fantasies with dignity‚Ä¶ Anyway, I just kept getting smaller and smaller beside the pond, more and more unnoticed in the darkening summer grass until I disappeared into the 32 years that have passed since then‚Ä¶\\" Each chapter of the novel begins with the words \\"so the wind won't blow it all away...Dust...American...Dust\\". According to the Brautigan archival website, this is a semi-autobiographical novel based on two separate incidents which took place in and around Eugene, Oregon in Brautigan's early teens. Brautigan had shot and slightly injured a friend during a duck hunt in Fern Ridge. At around the same time, the 14-year-old son of a well-known attorney in the Eugene area was shot and killed, also in a hunting accident.Notes on So The Wind Won't Blow It All Away at the Brautigan Bibliography and Archive, page found 2011-04-07. Some of the events in the novel are mentioned in Brautigan's biography You Can't Catch Death written by his daughter Ianthe Elizabeth Brautigan. Film adaptation A thirty-minute film based on this novel was produced by Swensen Productions (Ianthe Brautigan and husband Paul Swensen) and shown at the New York Film Festival in June 2000 and the Los Angeles Film Festival in October 2000. The screenplay was written by Robert Duxbury.

Considered to be one of the pioneers of research on quiltmaking in America, and was the pioneer of research on African-American quiltmaking. Her involvement in quilt research spans from founding and participating in various quilt groups, to writing articles in renowned quilt magazines and journals. As a quilt scholar, Benberry acquired a collection of important quilts dating from the late 19th century up to the 21st century, as well as an extensive collection of paper documents supplementing quilting exhibitions, books, articles and her personal research.MacDowell, Marsha; Worral, Mary (2009). \\"Unpacking the Legacy of a Pioneer Quilt Scholar/Collector\\". Presented at The Global Quilt: Cultural context, International Quilt Study Center Biennial Symposium. Life Cuesta Ray Benberry was born in Cincinnati, Ohio and raised in St. Louis, Missouri. Benberry obtained a bachelor's degree in education from Stowe Teachers College (now Harris-Stowe State University). She later earned her MLS in library science from the University of Missouri at St. Louis. She worked in the St. Louis public schools for 40 years and retired from her job in 1985. She married George L. Benberry in 1951. A visit to Kentucky to see her husband's family exposed Cuesta to quilts. She did not necessarily want to make the quilts, but was inclined to study the quilts. Mrs. Benberry looked at the individual in quiltmaking and African-American quiltmaking. She made extensive leaps in quilt research, especially in African-American quiltmaking. In the early 1970s Benberry started to write for a small magazine based in Sapulpa, Oklahoma, Nimble Needle Treasures, which was unusual in that it published articles as well as patterns. When it was wound up in 1975 she began to write instead for Quilter's Newsletter, then the only magazine of its kind. Cuesta Benberry died on August 23, 2007 at the age of 83. She was survived by her husband, her son, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Research With her education and professional background in teaching, Benberry understood the nuances of teaching in an academic setting, as well as acquiring research capabilities from her graduate studies in library science. Benberry's academic background greatly contributed to her success as a quilt historian. Benberry's interest in quilting began with her husband's family, who introduced her into the world of quilting as part of their family traditions. She was fascinated by the significance that quilts held in people's lives, ‚ÄúThey're on the bed. They're there at birth. They're there at death. They're part of the marriage bed. They're part of our lives, and they give us so many memories‚Ä¶ You'd call a quilt as you would a child. [Her mother-in-law would] lift up a trunk lid and say, 'Come see my Sugar Bowl'; she didn't say, 'Come see my blue and white quilt.' Then I wanted to learn more about their history.‚Äù It was the emotional connection that quilts held in her husband's family that intrigued Benberry to explore the historical significance of quiltmaking in America. Research focus The information acquired through Benberry's research included information about African- American quiltmaking, to which she eventually narrowed her research focus. There was little previous research done on African-American quiltmaking so in addition to sorting through her own research and exhausting library resources, Benberry began to interview African-American quilt-makers and gathered information about slave-made quilts, as well as their personal take on the role of African-American quilt-makers in the realm of American quilt history. Benberry ventured away from previous theories on African-American quilt making that suggested visual criteria was the main determinant in qualifying a quilt as African-American. She countered the theories on African-American quilts being determined by one visual style (improvisational) by noting in her comprehensive research the differences in technique throughout several African-American quilts. Benberry attributes the increased interest in African-American quiltmaking to three specific events: * Inclusion of Harriet Powers' Bible Quilt in Selections of Nineteenth Century Afro-American Art at the Metropolitan Museum of Art by Regina Perry * ‚ÄúHarriet Powers: Portrait Quilter‚Äù essay published in Missing Pieces: Georgia Folk Art, 1770‚Äì1776 written by Gladys-Marie Fry * The Mississippi quilt exhibition \\"More Than Just Something to Keep You Warm\\" by Roland Freeman. Research methods During her research, Benberry kept detailed notes, files, catalogues, correspondences and many other additional paper documents that are now being sorted and used as reference material for people interested in quilt research. Benberry used the resources around her in St. Louis to begin her research. She started at the St. Louis Public Library, the Washington University Library, the library at St. Louis University, and the St. Louis Mercantile Library at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. She immediately discovered that St. Louis was the center for manufacturing stamped goods for needlework, leading her to look into the commercial side of quiltmaking. In order to gain a quilter's perspective into quiltmaking, Benberry joined various round robin groups (pattern exchanges). Because Cuesta herself was not a quilt-maker, the members of these networks would often send her completed blocks so she could see what they should look like. By joining round robin groups, Benberry developed friendships with active quilters and found a network of people also interested in studying quilt history. Delores Hinson was one of the many friendships fostered by Benberry's interaction with various quilting networks. Hinson encouraged Benberry to research further into the history and significance behind the quilt block designs, as well as advised her to publish her research and knowledge of quiltmaking and its history. In 1986, Benberry went to England to work and study with the Zamani Soweto Council, a group of black South African women. These women were brought to England from South Africa to teach them quilting skills in hopes they would learn a profitable skill to become economically independent. Upon returning to the United States, Benberry began a lecture circuit featuring the Zamani Soweto Council, bringing attention to the apartheid struggle. Legacy Benberry is probably best known for her writing about the diverse contributions to quilting by African- Americans. Her books and articles include: * Always There: The African- American Presence in American Quilts (1992) * Piece of My Soul: Quilts by Black Arkansans (2000) * 20th Century Quilts 1900-1970: Women Make Their Mark (1997) * A Patchwork of Pieces: An Anthology of Early Quilt Stories, 1845‚Äì1940 (1993) * \\"Afro-American Women and Quilts: An Introductory Essay\\", a landmark article published in Uncoverings, 1980, ed. Sally Garoutte. Benberry also wrote the foreword to quilt history books such as Hidden in Plain View: A Secret Story of Quilts and the Underground Railroad (1999) by Jacqueline Tobin and Raymond Dobard, A Communion of the Spirit: African-American Quilters, Preservers, and Their Stories (1996) by Roland Freeman, Black Threads: An African American Quilting Sourcebook (2002) by Kyra E. Hicks, and Journey of the Spirit: the Art of Gwendolyn A. Magee (2004), edited by Ren√© Paul Barilleaux. Benberry was inducted into the Quilters Hall of Fame in 1983. She was a founding member of the American Quilt Study Group and the Women of Color Quilter's Network. Benberry's collection In 2009, Michigan State University Museum acquired Benberry's extensive American and African-American quilt ephemera and quilt history collections as well as her quilt kit collection. From December 6, 2009, to December 12, 2010, the museum hosted the exhibit, \\"Unpacking Collections: The Legacy of Cuesta Benberry, An African American Quilt Scholar.\\" The collection contained: *52 quilts from her personal collection *Over 100 quilt kits *Extensive research files on African- American history, African-American artists, museums and exhibitions with an African-American focus, African-American and African quiltmaking *Files dedicated to quilt making include: *Articles from academic journals, newspaper clippings, book chapters, magazines, notes, photographs, exhibition materials and correspondences. Benberry's collection is a testament to her efforts to explore all aspects associated with African-American quiltmaking, simultaneously putting them in context within American politics and African- American historical events.

In everyday terms, when poured, SCC is an extremely fluid mix with the following distinctive practical features ‚Äì it flows very easily within and around the formwork, can flow through obstructions and around corners (\\"passing ability\\"), is close to self- leveling (although not actually self-levelling), does not require vibration or tamping after pouring, and follows the shape and surface texture of a mold (or form) very closely once set. As a result, pouring SCC is also much less labor- intensive compared to standard concrete mixes. Once poured, SCC is usually similar to standard concrete in terms of its setting and curing time (gaining strength), and strength. SCC does not use a high proportion of water to become fluid ‚Äì in fact SCC may contain less water than standard concretes. Instead, SCC gains its fluid properties from an unusually high proportion of fine aggregate, such as sand (typically 50%), combined with superplasticizers (additives that ensure particles disperse and do not settle in the fluid mix) and viscosity-enhancing admixtures (VEA). Ordinarily, concrete is a dense, viscous material when mixed, and when used in construction, requires the use of vibration or other techniques (known as compaction) to remove air bubbles (cavitation), and honeycomb-like holes, especially at the surfaces, where air has been trapped during pouring. This kind of air content (unlike that in aerated concrete) is not desired and weakens the concrete if left. However it is laborious and takes time to remove by vibration, and improper or inadequate vibration can lead to undetected problems later. Additionally some complex forms cannot easily be vibrated. Self-consolidating concrete is designed to avoid this problem, and not require compaction, therefore reducing labor, time, and a possible source of technical and quality control issues. SCC was conceptualized in 1986 by Prof. Okamura at Kochi University, Japan, at a time when skilled labor was in limited supply, causing difficulties in concrete- related industries. The first generation of SCC used in North America was characterized by the use of relatively high content of binder as well as high dosages of chemicals admixtures, usually superplasticizer to enhance flowability and stability. Such high-performance concrete had been used mostly in repair applications and for casting concrete in restricted areas. The first generation of SCC was therefore characterized and specified for specialized applications. SCC can be used for casting heavily reinforced sections, places where there can be no access to vibrators for compaction and in complex shapes of formwork which may otherwise be impossible to cast, giving a far superior surface than conventional concrete. The relatively high cost of material used in such concrete continues to hinder its widespread use in various segments of the construction industry, including commercial construction, however the productivity economics take over in achieving favorable performance benefits and works out to be economical in pre-cast industry. The incorporation of powder, including supplementary cementitious materials and filler, can increase the volume of the paste, hence enhancing deformability, and can also increase the cohesiveness of the paste and stability of the concrete. The reduction in cement content and increase in packing density of materials finer than 80 ¬µm, like fly ash etc. can reduce the water-cement ratio, and the high- range water reducer (HRWR) demand. The reduction in free water can reduce the concentration of viscosity-enhancing admixture (VEA) necessary to ensure proper stability during casting and thereafter until the onset of hardening. It has been demonstrated that a total fine aggregate content (\\"fines\\", usually sand) of about 50% of total aggregate is appropriate in an SCC mix.  Overview  * SCC is measured using the slump-flow test (or \\"flow table\\") rather than the usual slump test, as it is too fluid to keep its shape when the cone is removed. A typical SCC mix will have slump-flow of around 500 ‚Äì 700mm. * SCC is weakened, not strengthened, by vibration. As vibration is not needed for compacting the mix, all that it achieves is to separate and segregate it.

A related 7 inch vinyl single on Adult Entertainments was also released in 1981. The single was played by John Peel on his influential BBC Radio 1 music show shortly after its release. Pressed in limited quantities, both the single and the album became cult items and copies have been much sought after by collectors. The making and impact of the album are the subject of a BBC Gaelic television documentary in the arts series Ealtainn, also titled Sad Day We Left The Croft. The 30 minute programme produced by Moja and MacTV was first broadcast on BBC Two Scotland on 27 September 2007. On 25 September 2007, Stornoway based independent record label Honcho reissued the Sad Day We Left The Croft album on CD. All the original tracks were remastered for the CD release. Additional tracks on the CD include both tracks from the related single, and four other previously unreleased tracks. Background In the late 1970s during the punk era, bands sprang up all across Britain following the musical style and 'do it yourself' ethos of groups such as the Ramones, Sex Pistols, and The Clash. This phenomenon was not confined to cities - many small towns and rural areas also had local punk music scenes, including the Western Isles of Scotland, where traditional Celtic and Gaelic music, and local covers bands had mainly prevailed. A number of punk bands emerged around the main town of Stornoway on Isle of Lewis. By 1979 there were several local punk and post punk bands, including The Bland, The Rong, The Subjects, Bruce Wayne Band, Noise Annoys, Battery Boys and Dirty Girls - and in 1980 they recorded the tracks for the album and the single. Recording The album was recorded at Croft Recordings, a small studio at Tong, about 5 miles from Stornoway. As the first recording studio in the Western Isles, Croft had been set up by Noel Eadie, a former member of Gaelic folk group Na h-√íganaich, in order to record local Gaelic and traditional music.

She was the daughter of Anthony Beaumont of Glenfield, Leicestershire, a direct descendant of Henry de Beaumont, and his wife Anne Armstrong, daughter of Thomas Armstrong of Corby. Family  After his first wife Audrey Saunders died on 1 May 1587, she became the second wife of Sir George Villiers, who was her cousin through his mother Colette, widow of Richard Beaumont. They had four children: *John (c. 1590-1657), later created Viscount Purbeck. *George (1592-1628), later created Duke of Buckingham. *Christopher (died 1630), later created Earl of Anglesey. *Susan (died 1651), married William Feilding, 1st Earl of Denbigh. Following the death of her first husband, she was created Countess of Buckingham in her own right in 1618. She made two further marriages, to Sir William Rayner of Orton, Peterborough, in 1606 and finally to Sir Thomas Compton, a younger son of Henry Compton, 1st Baron Compton. She became a Roman Catholic convert in the early 1620s, under the influence of the Jesuit John Percy.Hugh Trevor- Roper, Archbishop Laud (2000 edition), pp. 59-60. Mother of the royal favourite  Mary seems to have been the first person to recognise that George, her second son, had the ability to become a figure of political importance.Kenyon, J.P The Stuarts Fontana edition 1966 p.50 Although she said to have been penniless when she married his father, she somehow found the money to send him to the French court, where he learned the courtly skills, including fencing and dancing, and gained some fluency in the French language. His mother, having found the funds to fit him out with a suitable wardrobe, then sent him to the English Court, where he rapidly became the new favourite of King James I. As George rose, his mother, brothers and half-brothers rose with him: the King in 1618 said that he lived to no other end but to advance the Villiers family.Kenyon p.55 Mary arranged George's marriage to the great heiress Katherine, Baroness de Ros, who was said to be the richest woman in England; her enemies said that she had entrapped Katherine into the marriage by arranging for her to spend the night under the same roof as George, thus tarnishing her reputation and leaving her family with no choice but to accept George's proposal. She was a woman of formidable strength of character, but she was never popular, due to what was described as her relentless ambition and greed. She had been beautiful when young, but her manners struck the Court as loud and tactless. Kenyon p.55 In May 1623 she was at Goadby Marwood, with Viscount Purbeck, and wrote to the Earl of Middlesex with congratulations on the birth of his daughter Frances Cranfield.HMC 4th Report: Earl de la Warr (London, 1874), p. 287. When George was assassinated in 1628, it was said that Mary reacted to the news without any sign of surprise, as though it was something she had long expected. Whatever her private feelings may have been, she behaved outwardly after his death in a manner which struck most people as cold and unfeeling. She died four years later and was buried in Westminster Abbey.

They were also called shuku-eki (ÂÆøÈßÖ). These post stations (or \\"post towns\\") were places where travelers could rest on their journey around the nation. They were created based on policies for the transportation of goods by horseback that were developed during the Nara and Heian periods. History Nakasend≈ç's Magome-juku These post stations were first established by Tokugawa Ieyasu shortly after the end of the Battle of Sekigahara. The first post stations were developed along the T≈çkaid≈ç (followed by stations on the Nakasend≈ç and other routes). In 1601, the first of the T≈çkaid≈ç's fifty-three stations were developed, stretching from Shinagawa-juku in Edo to ≈åtsu-juku in ≈åmi Province. Not all the post stations were built at the same time, however, as the last one was built in 1624. The lodgings in the post stations were established for use by public officials and, when there were not enough lodgings, nearby towns were also put into use. The post station's toiyaba, honjin and sub-honjin were all saved for the public officials. It was hard to receive a profit as the proprietor of these places, but the sh≈çgun provided help in the form of various permits, rice collection and simple money lending, making it possible for the establishments to stay open. The hatago, retail stores, tea houses, etc., which were designed for general travelers, were able to build a profit. Ai no shuku were intermediate post stations; though they were unofficial resting spots, they had many of the same facilities.

Childhood Wikipedia Encyclopedia Gualberto was born in 1945 in Sevilla, Spain. His maternal grandfather was a jack-of-all-trades who sung Flamenco, nicknamed Currillo el Calentero. His mother, Pastora P√©rez Peral, was an amateur flamenco singer well-regarded by her neighbors. Gualberto entered the Salesians school where his two passions in life were formed: football and music. Under the attentive guidance of Don Pedro, his early mentor at the Salesians school, Gualberto and his classmates went on to become part of the local lore of Triana when his entire school football team was absorbed into the professional Real Betis Balompi√© soccer club. Gualberto would reach the All-Andalusian team and others, like Quino (Joaqu√≠n Sierra Vallejo), would go so far as to play for the Spain national football team. Youth At the age of 17, Gualberto quit football to dedicate himself to music, forming the rock group The Bats, which was followed in 1967 by Smash, a group which pioneered Spanish and Andalusian Rock history. America After disbanding the group, Gualberto left Spain for the US to study music, alongside his first wife, Jessica Jones Carson, an American from New York City. There, he began to establish himself as a composer. His first work was the rock opera \\"Behind Stars\\"; in cooperation with the \\"Good Vibrations Studio\\" and the \\"Yoga Symphony Orchestra\\", he formed a group for it with the famous Hindu sitar player Diwan Mothihar. This first solo recording has not been released yet. His early works feature the voice and lyrics of his first wife. Return to Spain Returning to Spain he published two solo albums: \\"A la vida al dolor\\" (\\"To life and pain \\") and \\"Vericuetos\\" (\\"Loopholes\\"). In 1976 he spent several months in France and the Netherlands, composing chamber music, which would lead to his next record: \\"Otros d√≠as\\" (\\"Other Days\\"). Between 1976 and 1979 he arranged and collaborated several projects, rock and flamenco compositions, which were all brought together on \\"Inquietudes a comp√°s\\" (\\"Beat Concerns\\"), re-released in 1997. In 1979 he recorded a fusion album between cante jondo songs (pure flamenco) and sitar called \\"Gualberto and Agujetas\\" (included on his 1997 album). The 80s During this decade he made mostly orchestration arrangements, such as flamenco and classical instrumentation. At this time he arranged \\"Casta\\" (\\"Caste\\") for Lole y Manuel and \\"Cuaderno de coplas\\" (\\"Song Notebook\\") and \\"A trav√©s del olvido\\" (\\"Through oblivion) by Carlos Cano, as well as the song \\"Rimas de B√©cquer,\\" for Benito Moreno. He also recorded the album \\"Puentes\\"(\\"Bridges,\\") and compositions for a clarinet trio called \\"Quartet Biennial,\\" a work for the Banda Municipal de Sevilla, as well as a piece called \\"Turru√±uelo\\" for an inaugural concert of the second Biennial. Gualberto has also directed the Triana's Rociero Choir longer than any other director in its history. Under his direction, many successful albums were released. In 1983, after some memorable concerts with Ricardo Mi√±o, he is asked to record once more live with Mi√±o, which resulted in the album \\"Puente M√°gico\\" (\\"Magical Bridge\\") In 1987, Gualberto started getting involved with musical computer science, which prompted the creation of his own studio, which he uses mainly to create music for cinema and television. The 90s In 1990 he returned to the performing scene, touring for a long summer. From this period, the first Cycle of the New Music at the University of Seville stands out. Also from this period is the album \\"Sin Comentario\\" (\\"No Comment\\"), released later by Lost Vinyl in 1996. Also of note are his participation at the prestigious International Festival of the Guitar in Cordova, a Festival in Italy where he played next to Nacho Duato, and Encuentros de Nueva (\\"New Meetings\\") together with Wim Mertens. In 1995 Gualberto participated in a new series of concerts, in which he worked with diverse instruments upon prerecorded bases, combining different styles and tendencies. In 1998 he recorded \\"Resistances\\" with Ricardo Mi√±o, and in 2000 he recorded the critically acclaimed \\"Contrastes\\" (\\"Contrasts,\\" or \\"With Frets\\", as the name has a double meaning in Spanish) along with Ricardo Mi√±o and several other artists. At this day, he combines his music investigation and studio work with live shows, as well as lectures and conferences at universities and cultural centres.

The term originates from the French word stagiaire meaning trainee, apprentice or intern. The French term commis is often used interchangeably with the aforementioned terms. The individual completing this activity is referred to as a stage, stagiaire (pronounced \\"stazhjer\\"; IPA: /sta. íj…õ: Å/), commis (assistant chef) or volontaire (\\"volunteer\\"). Before the advent of modern culinary schools, young cooks learned their craft as unpaid apprentices in professional restaurant kitchens and bakeries (and other food preparation establishments: pastry shops/patisserie, butcher shops/boucherie, candy shops/confisserie, hotels, etc.) under the guidance of a mentoring chef. This practice has become less common in recent decades. Staging is similar to trialling in professional kitchens. Trialling is an activity often used to assess the skills and training of a cooking job candidate. The hiring chef might assess the trial cook's adaptive skills in the new kitchen and how they interact with other staff in the restaurant. When a culinary student or cook-in-training is seeking an internship, often the trial is the next step after the interview. A server or waiter can also \\"stage\\" in a restaurant for much the same purpose. ReferencesFurther reading *Ruhlman, M (2007). The Elements of Cooking, Scribner.

Official U.S. Army campaign names for this period and location are Northern France and Rhineland. The term was popularized by the publication of the volume The Lorraine Campaign by the U.S. Army in 1950. Explanation of title As written by the volume's author: > Precise military terminology has been employed, except in those cases where > clarity and economy of style have dictated usage of a more general nature. > Thus, the Third Army operations in Lorraine are considered to be a > \\"campaign\\" in the general sense of the term, despite the fact that the > Department of the Army does not award a separate campaign star for these > operations.Cole, p. xiii. Although the term Lorraine campaign is unofficial, it represents a more traditional use of the term \\"campaign\\" in that the battles described by the term were part of a larger operation that had a set goal. By contrast, the official U.S. Army campaign names refer to what were actually multiple campaigns and large military organizations with diverse goals. Operationally, the Lorraine campaign encompasses the assaults across the Moselle and Sauer Rivers, the battles of Metz and Nancy, and the push to the German frontier and the crossing of the Saar/Sarre River during the first half of December 1944. Phases=Moselle The Third Army, led by General Patton, lacking gasoline, was unable to swiftly take both Metz and Nancy, unlike the actions that characterized the rapid advance across France. After the battle of Arracourt following the fall of Nancy and the meeting engagement of Mairy, the Third Army had to pause and await resupply. For the OKW, stopping Patton was a priority that resulted in replacements and reinforcements for the German Fifth Panzer Army and First Army. Fortress Metz Until 12 October 1944 and the beginning of the assault on Metz, exceptionally rainy weather hampered military operations. This combined with spirited German resistance and competent use of the terrain around Metz to delay the capture of Metz until late in November 1944. Saar and Siegfried Line After the fall of Metz and its fortifications, the Third Army launched an offensive to advance to the Westwall. Offensive operations by the U.S. Army in this part of the Western Front resumed in mid-March 1945 with the objective of occupying the Saar- Palatinate. The attack across the Saar River was under way as the Germans opened the Ardennes Offensive and Alsace-Lorraine Offensive. Operations on the Saar were scaled down as Third Army shifted troops north to counterattack the German offensive into Belgium and Luxembourg from the south. The move north of the Third Army marked the close of the Lorraine Campaign. Casualties The 3rd Army sustained 55,182 combat casualties during the Lorraine Campaign (6,657 killed, 36,406 wounded, 12,119 missing)Cole, p. 593 Exact German losses in Lorraine are unknown, but were suspected to be severe. At least 75,000 German prisoners were captured by the 3rd Army during the offensive. Cole, p. 592 Criticism Historian Carlo D'Este wrote that the Lorraine campaign was one of Patton's least successful, faulting him for not deploying his divisions more aggressively and decisively. A 1985 US Army study of the Lorraine campaign was highly critical of Patton.The Lorraine Campaign: An Overview, September‚ÄìDecember 1944, by Dr. Christopher R. Gabel (1985) The document states: :\\"Few of the Germans defending Lorraine could be considered first-rate troops. Third Army encountered whole battalions made up of deaf men, others of cooks, and others consisting entirety of soldiers with stomach ulcers.\\" '' :\\"Soldiers and generals alike assumed that Lorraine would fall quickly, and unless the war ended first, Patton's tanks would take the war into Germany by summer's end. But Lorraine was not to be overrun in a lightning campaign. Instead, the battle for Lorraine would drag on for more than 3 months.\\" :\\"Moreover, once Third Army penetrated the province and entered Germany, there would still be no first-rate military objectives within its grasp. The Saar industrial region, while significant, was of secondary importance when compared to the great Ruhr industrial complex farther north.\\" :\\"Was the Lorraine campaign an American victory? From September through November, Third Army claimed to have inflicted over 180,000 casualties on the enemy. But to capture the province of Lorraine, a problem which involved an advance of only 40 to 60 air miles, Third Army required over 3 months and suffered 50,000 casualties, approximately one-third of the total number of casualties it sustained in the entire European war.\\" :\\"Ironically, Third Army never used Lorraine as a springboard for an advance into Germany after all. Patton turned most of the sector over to Seventh Army during the Ardennes crisis, and when the eastward advance resumed after the Battle of the Bulge, Third Army based its operations on Luxembourg, not Lorraine. The Lorraine campaign will always remain a controversial episode in American military history.\\" :\\"Finally the Lorraine campaign demonstrated that Logistics often drive operations, no matter how forceful and aggressive the commanding general may be.\\" '' :\\"He discovered that violating logistical principles is an unforgiving and cumulative matter.\\" The US Army study highlighted Patton's tendency to overstretch his supply lines.

Also, the theatre is an object of cultural heritage of Belarus.  Initial construction  The building of the theatre was built in 1890 by the project of architects Kostantin Vvedensky and Karol Kozlowski. The construction was financed from donations of the citizens of Minsk. The main facade looks out onto the square formed by the intersection of two central streets, vulica Karla Marksa and vulica Frydrycha Enhielsa.  History  The modern theatre was established on September 14, 1920, and it is located in a building of the Minsk provincial theatre. In 1944 has been renamed in honour of classic of the Belarusian literature, poet Janka Kupa≈Ça. The theatre during the Second All-Belarusian Congress in 1944 The building has been the venue of several important historical congresses in the first half of the 20th century. On 2-8 December 1917, the First Congress of the Armies of the Russian Western Front took place in the theatre building, which was attended by 714 delegates, including 473 Bolsheviks. Vladimir Lenin was elected honorary chairman. Representatives of the central Bolshevik structures Sergo Ordzhonikidze and V. Volodarsky took part in the congress. The congress declared the recognition of Bolshevik rule in Russia, elected a new command of the Western Front, in which the Bolsheviks took the dominant positions. On December 18-31, 1917, the theatre hosted the First All-Belarusian Congress, a representative national congress of Belarusians. The event brought together almost 1,900 delegates from all regions of Belarus to discuss the future political status of Belarus and its system of government. The congress was forcibly dispersed by the Russian Bolsheviks, under whose control Minsk was at the time. The Council formed at the congress continued to operate underground, in February-March 1918 it announced the creation of an independent Belarusian Democratic Republic and still exists today as the Rada BNR. On 2-3 February 1919, the Bolshevik Provisional Government of the Soviet Socialist Republic of Belarus held the First All-Belarusian Congress of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Red Army Deputies in the theatre building, at which 230 delegates from various Bolshevik structures approved the first constitution of Soviet Belarus. They passed resolutions to declare a federation of Soviet Belarus and Soviet Russia, ceded significant territories of Belarus to Russia. On 27 June 1944, during the Nazi occupation of Belarus, the theatre hosted the Second All- Belarusian Congress convened by Belarusian political forces united around the collaborationist Belarusian Central Rada. The congress brought together 1,039 delegates representing various regions of Belarus, including Bielastok and Smalensk, and organisations of the Belarusian diaspora. The congress adopted resolutions condemning Soviet and Polish policies toward Belarus, reaffirming Belarus' status as an independent state, and declaring the Belarusian Central Rada as the temporary supreme Belarusian state body.

History When NBCUniversal was formed in 2004, it owned many entertainment television channels in Europe and Latin America. These were mostly a few international versions of the Sci Fi Channel, three action and suspense series channels in Europe, the Italian Studio Universal channel and the Latin American version of the USA Network. In 2007, NBC Universal acquired Sparrowhawk Media Group, which at the time was a British private equity-backed media company managing a collection of digital television channels, and integrated it into NBC Universal Global Networks. The purchase more than doubled the number of international channels in NBC Universal's portfolio. Sparrowhawk's crown jewel was an international network of drama channels available on most continents under the Hallmark Channel brand, but Diva TV, Movies 24, and KidsCo channels were also available. Altogether, the company broadcast about 70 different channels by 2009. On 5 October 2009, it was announced that the venture would be renamed Universal Networks International and focus its attention on five channel brands, all with \\"Universal\\" in their name: *Universal Channel *13th Street Universal *Syfy Universal *Diva Universal *Studio Universal The overhaul started in late 2009 and progressed during 2010. Most of the international Sci Fi channels were rebranded as Syfy. The Hallmark Channel brand was also phased out in most markets during 2010. Typically, it was replaced by the Universal Channel brand in markets where that brand wasn't available before. In many markets where Universal Channel was already present, Hallmark Channel was replaced by Diva Universal with one each replaced by Studio Universal or 13th Street Universal. Following the merger of NBCUniversal and Comcast in 2011, the following channels are also operated and distributed by NBCUniversal: *E! Entertainment Television *Style Network *The Golf Channel The DreamWorks Channel was placed under the NBCU International executive vice president, lifestyle and kids Duccio Donati in August 2017. This paired the channel with E! international channels and NBCU lifestyle channel content.

However, today Mason is perhaps most remembered as the cadet who graduated first in the class of 1829 at the United States Military Academy at West Point, ahead of future Confederate Army commander Robert E. Lee. Mason and Lee were tied for the head of the class in Artillery, Tactics, and Conduct, but Mason bested Lee in all other subjects and graduated with an overall score of 1,995.5 points out of a possible 2,000, compared to Lee's 1,966.5. Mason resigned his commission in 1831, two years after graduation. Mason and Lee also still have the two highest graduation point scores in the history of West Point. The third highest score in the Academy's history is held by Douglas MacArthur. Later, Mason was president of the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad, from 1852 to 1853, and United States Commissioner of Patents, from 1853 to 1857. During his twice interrupted (he submitted his resignation three times 1853-7) tenure as Commisioner of Patents, Mason instituted a heretofore rare experiment in workplace diversity. He hired several women, among them Clara Barton, to work as equals to their male counterparts. He was the Democratic candidate for Governor of Iowa in 1867, but was defeated by Samuel Merrill. Mason was a patron of the painter George Henry Yewell. Charles Mason died in Burlington, Iowa on February 25, 1882. References *Philip Van Doren Stern, Robert E.

Medieval landmarks A well- preserved moated site at Puddlehall located at . dates to the 13th century and was cited by University College Dublin Professor Sean O Riordain as one of the finest examples of a moated house in Ireland. The remains of a castle are also to be found on the church grounds. Calendar and civil paper references Whitechurch Ecclesia Templi Albi was granted to the order of St John in 1300. In 1508 William Preston enfifed Archdeacon Robert Sutton and Thomas Cornwalshe, Vicar of Stamullen, with the manor of Whitechurch (alias Tullaghtipper), \\"containing the town and lands of le Tunryng (alias Surnyng), Clonyng, Killenmore, Killbregaghe, Killussy, Rathmore, Collenbakeston, Ardress, Cloghle, Osberiston and Clanswhiche\\".In 1541 the tithes of the Rectory of Whitechurch (18 couples of grain, ¬£12) were held by David Sutton and Richard Aylmer.

Biography=Early life O'Flynn was born in Runanga in 1918. He was the son of Francis Edward O'Flynn and Margaret Helen Valentine Duncan. He received his education at Christchurch Normal School and Christchurch Boys' High School. On leaving school he was employed as a clerk by the Education Department in Wellington and attended Victoria University College part-time. In 1939 he became a clerk to the Wellington Labourers‚Äô Union Secretary and completed a BA in 1940. Further study was interrupted by World War II, and he joined the Royal New Zealand Air Force in 1942, serving in the Pacific and attaining the rank of flight lieutenant. He married Sylvia Elizabeth Hefford in 1942 and they had four children. At the 1947, 1950 and 1953 local-body elections he was stood unsuccessfully for the Wellington City Council on the Labour Party ticket. Legal career At the end of the war O'Flynn was employed as a law clerk in the Wellington firm O‚ÄôRegan and Arndt. He continued to study law and completed an LLB in 1947 and LLM in 1948. Leaving O'Regan and Arndt in 1954, he practised in Wellington as a barrister and solicitor until 1968, when he was made a Queen‚Äôs Counsel (QC) and practised as such until 1972. As one of New Zealand‚Äôs most prominent QCs, O'Flynn was renowned for his advocacy and willingness to take on the establishment of the time. His reputation as one of New Zealand‚Äôs leading advocates in the 1950s and 1960s was enhanced when he represented 126 survivors and families of victims in the Wahine ferry disaster inquiry held in June 1968. O'Flynn was also the first (and only) lawyer to sue prime minister Robert Muldoon successfully on behalf of a client: Muldoon was forced to pay out $5,000 for defaming O'Flynn‚Äôs client Brian Brooks (who later became a professor of law at Victoria University). The 1972 case Brooks v Muldoon followed the outcome of remarks made on a current affairs television programme called Gallery by Robert Muldoon. O'Flynn conducted a lengthy cross- examination of the defendant (Muldoon) which fascinated the country. It was described one of O'Flynn's highpoints at the bar. Political career He represented the seat of Kapiti from 1972 to 1975, when he was defeated. Following his defeat O'Flynn considered standing for Mayor of Wellington in 1977, but he withdrew in favour of Sir Frank Kitts. At the same election he stood for the Wellington City Council and was elected. Between 1980 and 1981 he was leader of the Labour caucus on the council. He was re-elected in 1980 but unexpectedly lost his seat on the council in 1983. His defeat was in the wake of him hinting that he would rethink his position on the council should he become a cabinet minister after being promoted earlier in 1983. Following the controversial de-selection of Gerald O'Brien, O'Flynn was selected as his replacement in the Island Bay electorate. O'Brien ran as an independent candidate and drew away many former Labour voters causing O'Flynn to come close to losing one of Labour's safest seats. He was elected narrowly by 650 votes and represented Island Bay from 1978 to 1987, when he retired due to ill health. Soon after returning to Parliament he was appointed as Shadow Minister of Health by leader Bill Rowling. He was later shifted from Health to be Shadow Minister of Justice in 1981. O'Flynn was a backer of David Lange for leader and was rewarded by being promoted to the front bench and given the role of Shadow Attorney-General. Following Labour's victory at the O'Flynn was naturally expected to in both political and legal circles to become Attorney- General, but Lange had been persuaded by his deputy Geoffrey Palmer (who had been O'Flynn's legal clerk decades earlier) to appoint him to the role instead. During the Fourth Labour Government he was a cabinet minister and served as Minister of Defence from 1984 to 1987. He was also Minister of State, Minister in charge of War Pensions, Minister in charge of Rehabilitation, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and Associate Minister of Overseas Trade and Marketing. As Minister of Defence he famously said that \\"he would defend New Zealand by blowing up bridges and tunnels.\\"Parliamentary Debates. House of Representatives, Volume 482, https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=EkUHUmYFyGYC&pg;=PA10591 He was instrumental in developing Labour's nuclear-free policies, which despite resulting in the breakdown of ANZUS, O'Flynn described as \\"by far the brightest thing [the Government] had done.\\" He had a meeting in Malaysia in 1985 with United States Secretary of State George Shultz, where Shultz lambasted New Zealand's stance but O'Flynn defended their position resulting in deadlock. O'Flynn disliked the Defence portfolio and felt the officials at the Ministry of Defence took him for granted on many issues. On three occasions (July, August and December 1985) he threatened to resign as minister after Lange failed to back him during a disagreement with officials regarding the posting of a Defence official overseas at great cost to the taxpayer. O'Flynn thought that it was a waste of public money and that the official was little more than 'a big, dull fat Poo-Bah'. His bench mate Michael Bassett felt that O'Flynn's dislike of the defence portfolio was more an expression of his disappointment that Lange had broken his promise of giving him the position of Attorney-General. O'Flynn and Lange became increasingly estranged and their communications were reduced to being conducted through Bassett as an intermediary. Not long after deciding to retire, he suffered a stroke (which he later recovered from) and was unable to deliver his valedictory speech in Parliament. It was read instead by Mike Moore on his behalf. Life after politics He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1987; however, that same ill-health prevented him from travelling to England to be sworn into the Council by Queen Elizabeth II.

Minsk Zoo () is located in a southeast part of Minsk near Svislach River. Location and extent Minsk Zoo is situated in the south-east part of Minsk in floodplain of the river Svisloch. According to the order of Minsk City Council of 2 March 2001, the territory with total area 42 hectares in frameworks of the streets Uborevicha, Tashkentskaya, Golodeda and Mashinostroiteley was allocated for the Minsk Zoo. From the southern part this area is bordered with large urban district Chyzhouka, from the north this territory is limited by industrial zone of Minsk Automobile Plant, in western direction ‚Äì by Chizhovskoye water reservoir with recreation zone for the inhabitants of Chyzhouka. Minsk Zoo has good transport connections with other parts of Minsk. Metro station Avtozavodskaya is located at distance of 1.5 km from the entrance. In nearest future another underground station will be built in the district Chyzhouka at distance of 1 km from the entrance. There are 5 bus routes and 3 trolley-bus routes connecting Minsk Zoo with other districts of Minsk. 17.5 ha with perimeter boundaries of which 6 ha serve to animal exhibits (so-called \\"Old Zoo\\" built during 1980's by Minsk Automobile Plant, and \\"New Zoo\\", built in 2001‚Äì2002) and total area 42 ha is allocated for further development of Minsk Zoo. History The Minsk Zoo was established in 1984 by nature amateurs from the Minsk Automobile Plant. Its founder and the first manager was Fedor Revsin, an engineer and a designer of the Minsk Automobile Plant, also the chairman of the Nature Amateurs Club of the plant. The first foster-children of the new Zoo were wild animals, which had found themselves in miserable condition (an injured white stork, swans, polluted with black oil in an industrial precipitation pond, young roes, small foxes and others). Owing to the support, rendered by the management of the plant and to enthusiasm of its employees, small Zoo with enclosures for animals was built in floodplain of the Svislach river, at the bank of a picturesque oxbow lake (former river-bed), not far from the plant. Even at that time, our animal collection counted in about 50 species, including those of non-local fauna, presented by other zoos from Grodno, Moscow, Leningrad, Mena etc. The Zoo first opened to visitors, who were mostly Minsk inhabitants, on August 9, 1984. This day is considered to be the day of the Minsk Zoo foundation. Then it had a name of a Zoological Garden by the Minsk Automobile Plant. Before the year of 1989, entrance to the Zoo used to be free. The Minsk Automobile Plant had provided financing of the Zoo. In 1987 the director of the Zoo, Fedor Revsin had agreed on a development project of the zoological garden on the area of 17 hectares. His major development concept was the development of water- and shorebird enclosures, as well as enclosures for animals of moderate latitudes. In 1988 Minsk Automobile plant began construction. However, complicated economical situation in the country interfered with the realization of the Zoo development project. The plant had to give up the construction, and it was frozen. Just 50% of the fence to surround for 17 hectares was managed. Animals had to be kept in the enclosures and rooms which had been built during 1984‚Äì1988. In such a state the zoological garden had existed for years of Perestroika and economical reforms. Only owing to enthusiasm of its employees, the Zoo survived, lived, accepted visitors, extended its collection and bred animals. In 1994 the zoological garden acquired at last the status of the Minsk Municipal Zoo, as well as municipal subsidy for feeding animals. However, its development and capital construction were kept by municipal authorities due to various ecological factors: such as, the zoo was quite near to the industrial area of the plant, Chizhovka lake, its location in floodplain of the Svislach river. Finally, in 1999, as licenses and permissions were obtained, capital construction of the 1st line in frames of the Zoo development commenced. In years of 1999‚Äì2001 the objects of the 1st line were completed: the veterinary center (area occupied of 400m2), 15 new enclosures for animals, kitchen and feeding room for animals (250 m2), toilet for visitors (100 m2), parking area for 50 cars, main entrance. Also the perimeter boundary (fence) was finished. Further development In 2000 there was the decision of Minsk City Council made for further development of the Zoo along the floodplain of the Svislach, in total area of 42 hectares. Lately the preliminary concept of the Zoo development on this territory has been made. Besides, objects of the 2nd line construction have been placed under project. This 2nd line includes: *Exposition area of \\"South America\\" with a tropical pavilion and open enclosures, children‚Äôs zoo, also service and household buildings (booking office, entry control station, garages, store-houses). For the years 2003-2005 the municipal authorities have granted financial support for realization of these projects. *Main exposition zone of Minsk Zoo will be located along Uborevicha Street till the crossing of Uborevicha and Golodeda Streets. Footbridge will connect exposition zone with entrance part. This bridge will go over the river, the floodplain part of the area with enclosures for Cranes, Geese, Storks and other ornamental water birds. In southwest part of main exposition zone the following pavilions will be located: \\"Exotarium\\", reservoir for fur-seals, aviarium and stable with riding-school. *Central part will be the place for predatory mammals enclosures. Southeast part will be occupied by enclosures for mountain ungulates and raptorial birds \\"Artificial cliffs\\" with pavilion \\"The world of the night\\" inside, as well as pavilions \\"The world of monkeys\\" and \\"South-East Asia\\", \\"Africa\\". *There will be another entrance on the crossing of Uborevicha and Golodeda Streets. Artificial and natural water bodies for different bird species will be located along the river Svislach. *Zone with valuable floodplain forest areas will be conserved as Landscape Park with its natural fauna and flora. *It is planned to organize so-called \\"Children‚Äôs Zoo\\" with educational club for young amateurs of nature, entertaining complex ‚ÄúFairy- tail fortress‚Äù with area for contact of visitors with tame animals, children‚Äôs caf√©, place for riding on pony, mini-exhibition of zoo-sculpture. Children‚Äôs Mono-railway will connect ‚ÄúChildren‚Äôs Zoo‚Äù with main exposition zone. *Distance site after Golodeda Street is reserved for ‚ÄúEcological village‚Äù in remote future. It should be outdoor museum representing traditional land use practices and trades, keeping of domestic animals. *Two official-economic zones will be allocated along Uborevicha Street. It is planned also to build Scientific Centre to study wild animals in captivity near the crossing of Uborevicha and Golodeda Streets. The shape of main part of enclosures will be irregular for better survey. It will be possible to survey some large enclosures from different levels. *The project will be fulfilled step by step, in such a way, that Minsk Zoo can normally work at any stage of its development. It is proposed to build Exotarium‚Äù, open enclosures, economic zone and stable with two riding-schools during the first stage. The next stage will be reconstruction of old part and creation of ¬´Children‚Äôs Zoo¬ª and building of new main entrance with administrative-cultural-entertainment centre and footbridge. Further development of Minsk Zoo will proceed along Svislach river in direction of Golodeda Street. A male wisent at Minsk Zoo. Animals At present, the collection of animals of Minsk Zoo counts for 1343 mammals in 64 species, 213 birds in 47 species, 92 reptiles in 53 species, 19 amphibians in 6 species, 1927 invertebrates in 16 species (totally 3585 animals in 186 species). The most important captive breeding success: *Regular breeding of such species as Steppe eagle, Eagle owl, Purple gallinule, Lynx, Brown bear, Southern coati, Egyptian fruit bat, Crab-eating macaque, Collared peccary, Lama and others.

Biography=Early life O'Brien was born in Wellington in 1924. He joined the Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF) in 1942 when he was 17 and trained as a radar operator in Harewood and Wigram. He did not see overseas' service as the Americans \\"had enough manpower in [that] area\\". He owned and operated his own business Enzart Import Ltd. which exported locally manufactured products overseas. He was also a member of the Brooklyn Progressive Association and Brooklyn Community Association. Political career He joined the Labour Party and in 1946 he became the electorate secretary, the seat represented by Prime Minister Peter Fraser, and later became chairman. In 1963 he became the secretary of the Wellington Labour Representation Committee. In 1950 he suggested to Frank Kitts that he should stand on behalf of Labour for the mayor and council; Kitts was the highest-polling councillor, although he did not win the mayoralty until 1956. O'Brien stood as a Labour candidate for the council himself in both 1959 and 1962 but was unsuccessful. In 1962 and again in 1965 he stood unsuccessfully for the Wellington Harbour Board on the Labour Party ticket. In 1965 he was elected as a member of the Wellington City Council and re-elected in 1968. On the council he was deputy chair of the city's works department. During this period O'Brien was approached to stand for Labour in the 1967 Petone by-election. He declined the invitation however, citing the demands of running his business would be incompatible with a parliamentary candidature at that time. He represented the Island Bay electorate from to 1978. Following his election to Parliament O'Brien did not stand for re-election to the city council and his brother Brian (a sports journalist) replaced him on the Labour ticket. Brian O'Brien was elected in 1971 and served as a councillor until 1980 when he retired. O'Brien was particularly opposed to the Vietnam war and was honoured by the Vietnamese in appreciation. He went as far as to use his importing business to bring goods from Vietnam into New Zealand, directly defying the policy of the Holyoake government. In 1974 O'Brien was elected as Vice-President of the Labour Party. As vice-president was on the panel to choose the successor to Norman Kirk in the Sydenham electorate. Initially the three electorate representatives wanted John Kirk and the three head office nominees wanted the party secretary John Wybrow. O'Brien switched his vote to John Kirk, who got the nod. He was also on the committee that chose David Lange at the 1977 Mangere by-election. In January 1976 he was appointed by Labour leader Bill Rowling as Shadow Minister of Local Government. He was charged over an incident in 1976 in Christchurch, where he allegedly asked two boys back to his motel room for a drink. The charges were thrown out, and O'Brien maintained that it was nothing but an attempt by political enemies to \\"get rid of me\\". He also stated that he got more sympathy from members of the National Party than from his own party. He was subsequently deselected by Labour for the Island Bay electorate. In 1978, he was defeated as an Independent Labour candidate. He ran against the official Labour candidate, Frank O'Flynn, and received some 3,700 votes at O'Flynn's expense, almost costing O'Flynn what had always been a Labour bastion. O'Brien reaffirmed his rift with Labour at the 1979 Christchurch Central by-election where he endorsed the Social Credit candidate Terry Heffernan. At the 1981 election, the Social Credit Party invited him to stand for his old Island Bay electorate, but he declined. Later life O'Brien died in Wellington on 13 December 2017. He was survived by his wife of 61 years.

First officially released as part of the Microsoft Entertainment Pack 1 in 1990, it was first included in the standard install of Windows 3.1 in 1992, replacing Reversi from Windows 3.0. Microsoft Minesweeper was included without major changes in all subsequent Windows releases until Windows Vista, at which time an updated version by Oberon Media replaced it. In Windows 8 and later the game is not included with a fresh Windows install, but Microsoft Studios has published an updated version of it, developed by Arkadium, on Windows Store. Gameplay The goal of Minesweeper is to uncover all the squares on a grid that do not contain mines without being \\"blown up\\" by clicking on a square with a mine underneath. The location of most mines is discovered through a logical process, but some require guessing, usually with a 50-50 chance of being correct. Clicking on the game board will reveal what is hidden underneath the chosen square or squares (a large number of blank squares [bordering 0 mines] may be revealed in one go if they are adjacent to each other). Some squares are blank while others contain numbers (from 1 to 8), with each number being the number of mines adjacent to the uncovered square. To help the player avoid hitting a mine, the location of a suspected mine can be marked by flagging it with the right mouse button. The game is won once all blank or numbered squares have been uncovered by the player without hitting a mine; any remaining mines not identified by flags are automatically flagged by the computer. However, in the event that a game is lost and the player had mistakenly flagged a safe square, that square will either appear with a red X, or else a red X covering the mine (both denoting the square as safe). The game board comes in three set sizes with a predetermined number of mines: \\"beginner\\", \\"intermediate\\", and \\"expert\\", although a \\"custom\\" option is available as well. Evolution The Windows 98 Style of Microsoft Minesweeper In early versions of the game, a cheat code let players peek beneath the tiles. By the year 2000, the game had been given the name of Flower Field instead of Minesweeper in some translations of Windows 2000 (like the Italian version), featuring flowers instead of mines. Flower Fields gameplay was otherwise unchanged, as was the executable file name. Minesweeper Flags In 2003, Microsoft created a variation called Minesweeper Flags in MSN Messenger, which is played against an opponent with the objective to find the mines rather than the surrounding squares. Windows Vista and Windows 7 The \\"Flower Field\\" version of Minesweeper, developed by Oberon Media, shows a garden blooming when the game is lost. It is the default in specific distributions of Windows. The game's color scheme changed with the release of Vista (from gray to either blue or green). The icons were updated to match the Aero look. It also came with a more peaceful \\"flower\\" motif (called \\"Flower Garden\\") to replace the landmines (a game style called \\"Minesweeper\\"). The visual change also allowed for the Board to be \\"Silver and Blue\\" or \\"Green\\". This iteration of Minesweeper was created by Oberon Media. The controversy over the land mine theme of the game was settled by defaulting the appearance based on region so that \\"sensitive\\" areas used the flower theme, but some still wanted the game removed from Windows altogether. The regionalization effort also included changing the game's name in some cases to match the theme. Windows 8 and later Microsoft removed Minesweeper from Windows 8 and instead published a free equivalent on Microsoft Store. The new version is developed by Arkadium and is ad-supported. The initial release was supported by 30 second video ads. Later releases had monthly and annual subscription options to remove the ads. Multiple news outlets criticized the change as greedy. This version updates both motifs (themes called \\"Modern\\" and \\"Garden\\" as of Windows 10). Daily challenges and an adventure mode were also added. As of Windows 10, the non-premium version has six modes of play: Easy (9x9), Medium (16x16), Expert (30x16), Custom, Adventure, and Daily Challenges. The two themes are \\"Modern theme\\" and \\"Garden theme\\". On the main menu, there are sections for Awards, Leaderboards, Statistics, and Tutorials. But if the window is resized to be much smaller, then it becomes impossible to change the theme. If the game window is made larger, the full menu is available and the theme can be changed. Some of the game options are only relevant for a touchscreen, like the flag mode and swiping. Reception Business Insider called the game an \\"iconic part\\" of the Windows operating system.

The estate was once held by the Bishops of Kildare. Calendar and historical references In 1527, Thomas, Bishop of Kildare, granted Bishopscourt to Piers Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond, and his wife Margaret. In 1537 it passed to John Alen, Lord Chancellor of Ireland. In 1676 it passed to John Margetson, later to die at the Siege of Limerick in 1690 fighting for William of Orange. His daughter married Brabazon Ponsonby, recorded in folklore as a fortune hunter. Ponsonby family The Ponsonby family became the most powerful political dynasty in 17th century Ireland. John Ponsonby was speaker of the Irish House of Commons (1753‚Äì1761), and William Ponsonby was leader of the Irish Whigs (1789‚Äì1803) and birthplace of his brother George Ponsonby (1755‚Äì1817) leader of the Whig Party in the British House of Commons at Westminster (1808‚Äì1817), his uncle Major-General Sir William Ponsonby (1772‚Äì1815) whose inept charge at the Battle of Waterloo resulted in his death at the hands of the Polish Lanciers and was studied as an example of failed battle strategy for generations afterwards, and of his sister Mary Ponsonby, wife of The 2nd Earl Grey, British Prime Minister from 1830 to 1834 and best known nowadays as the Earl Grey of the tea brand. House Bishopscourt House in 1879, from The County Seats of the Noblemen and Gentlemen of Great Britain and Ireland, by Francis Orpen Morris. The fabric of the house was reconstructed to the design of Sir Richard Morrison in 1790.http://archiseek.com/2010/1790-bishops-court-house-naas-co- kildare/#.UyMfsc59LaQ It was on the grounds of the estate that Daniel O'Connell fought a duel with John d'Esterre on 1 February 1815. Subsequently, the house burnt down in the 1950s and was rebuilt. At the walled west corner of the estate is a small blue door, and the adjacent road junction on the Straffan-Kill road is referred to as the Blue Door. Scott, Kennedy, McGillycuddy In 1838 Bishopscourt was sold by Frederick Ponsonby to The 3rd Earl of Clonmell, and in 1914 sold on to Edward Kennedy from Baronrath, at the time the most famous breeder of racehorses in Ireland. Kennedy‚Äôs stallion The Tetrarch, standing at Bishopscourt, is confirmed as the most successful sire in the world in 1919. In 1938 the house passed to Edward‚Äôs daughter Patricia (Tiggie) Kennedy and her husband, Dermot McGillycuddy, heir to Senator McGillycuddy of the Reeks, an ancient clan chiefdom from County Kerry. Edward Kennedy's son Major DM (John) Kennedy won an MC at Anzio whilst serving with 1st Battalion Irish Guards and was later killed at Terporten Castle in Germany in February 1945.

It marks the triple-point boundary of the planning areas of Kallang, Geylang and Toa Payoh. At this interchange, four major roads (Serangoon Road, Upper Serangoon Road, MacPherson Road, Bendemeer Road), two service roads (Jalan Toa Payoh, Jalan Kolam Ayer) and one expressway (Pan Island Expressway; PIE) meet. This interchange has gone through several upgrading works to ease congestion, its latest upgrading completed in January 2012. History The dual two-lane Woodsville Flyover was built between Jalan Kolam Ayer and Jalan Toa Payoh in 1982. Due to the increased traffic demand over the years, the flyover was upgraded in 1994 to a dual four-lane flyover, merging it with the Pan-Island Expressway extension. A flyover to cater to traffic heading towards the Central Expressway (CTE) was also included in the project. Leading to 2007, traffic volumes on at-grade roads during peak hours at this interchange are very high, reaching up to 8400 vehicles per hour, reaching its traffic capacity. There has also been major traffic congestion at the at-grade road interchange, with a possible gridlock in a few years time. To ease the traffic flow, the Land Transport Authority announced in 2007 that the interchange will go through an upgrading project. 2008 Upgrading project The Woodsville Interchange upgrading project commenced in the third quarter of 2007 with the awarding of the Singapore branch of Gammon Construction Limited as the main civil contractor after a six-months study conducted by Parsons Brinckerhoff Pte Ltd to evaluate the best construction method that is safe and best minimises inconvenience to motorists, residents and business owners. The project was expected to be completed by 2011 back then. The project includes the building of three underpasses and an overpass. Two of the underpasses will have two lanes per direction each, stretching from Serangoon Road and Bendemeer Road to Upper Serangoon Road. The third underpass will have one lane and will stretch from MacPherson Road to Bendemeer Road. The flyover will stretch from a slip road of Exit 15 along Pan Island Expressway to Kallang Way. In addition, at-grade traffic flows will be modified, including the closing and removal of Whampoa North, a U-turn road from Bendemeer Road to Serangoon Road, with the land returning to the government. This project is one of the most expensive of its kind at that time, costing S$130 million, several times more expensive than any single flyover and tunnel project completed elsewhere in Singapore. It is one of the most complex construction as well due to the MRT tunnel beneath the interchange and the Deep Tunnel Sewerage System which runs parallel to the expressway. Several buildings will be affected by the road widening and the former Serangoon Fire Station will have to be torn down. Benefits Once the upgrading project is completed, travel will be smoother between the east and the city; and the northeast and the city. Traffic volume at the at-grade junction will also decrease allowing smoother traffic flow, especially for motorists entering Pan Island Expressway (westbound) from Upper Serangoon Road and MacPherson Road. The traffic capacity at this interchange will also increase to 11,000 vehicles per hour during peak hours.

He has recorded two CDs, the first named \\"Grandes √äxitos de Rouxinol Faduncho\\" (Portuguese for \\"Rouxinol Faduncho's Big Hits\\"), launched on 5 December 2005. As he had \\"already fooled everyone with the first CD\\", he decided to launch a second one, named \\"Best On\\". Both CDs have songs featuring him as the singer, Paulo Valentim (guitarist) playing the Portuguese guitar, Jo√£o Maria Veiga playing the guitar and Rodrigo Serr√£o playing the acoustic bass guitar. Rouxinol's character is a fado lover, a married man, although he often sings like a bachelor with a very active sexual life. He was an illegal alien in Germany, where he sang fados in bars until he was thrown out. When he arrived in Portugal he decided to make a CD so he could afford to build a house in Barcarena for him, his wife and the love of his life, the china dogs (to whom he actually made a song called C√£es de Loi√ßa, Portuguese for China dogs). He also said that each copy of his CD you buy, you're helping two china dogs. This was said to be the Portuguese CD with most illegal downloads until May 2006. Rouxinol sings in a very relaxed form, often using an unusual way of talking and popular expressions, giving wrong accents to almost every word, and getting rather confused when trying to speak English (once answering \\"I love you too\\" to a girl who told him \\"Fuck you\\"). Rouxinol's songs talk about the life of an average Portuguese adult male, going from fighting with his neighbour and complaining about the chronic Portuguese wildfires and the government to singing the theme songs of his favourite cartoons as a kid (Abelha Maia and Dartac√£o).

The film stars Ricardo Dar√≠n in his third collaboration with Campanella and Eduardo Blanco in his fourth collaboration, as well as Mercedes Mor√°n and Valeria Bertuccelli. Plot Rom√°n Maldonado (Ricardo Dar√≠n) was born during a carnival fair held at \\"Luna de Avellaneda\\", a sports and social club located in Avellaneda, Buenos Aires province. He is made a member for life, and the club becomes a central part of his life. The club used to have over 8,000 members in its heyday, but in the 2000s membership has dwindled to some 300. The neighbourhood is decaying, the surviving inhabitants are struggling financially and gatherings are hardly what they used to be. To top things off, Rom√°n discovers his wife Ver√≥nica is having an affair, and their marriage finds itself at its worst. Together with Amadeo Grimberg (Eduardo Blanco) and Graciela (Mercedes Mor√°n), friends from the club, he must fight for the survival of the place before it is sold off and turned into a casino. The film chronicles the ups and downs of this fight, as well as Amadeo's struggling relationship with Cristina (Valeria Bertuccelli), Rom√°n's family crisis and the difficulties Graciela has after her husband leaves. In the end, a vote to keep the club alive is defeated 33 to 26, and the main characters find themselves parting ways in a bittersweet manner.

The mine and assets are currently owned by the Pike River Recovery Agency, a stand-alone ministry of the Government of New Zealand, following the liquidation of Solid Energy in 2018. It was to begin production in early 2008, and was initially expected to produce around one million tonnes of coal per year for around 20 years,Digging deep around New Zealand, LG - New Zealand Local Government, Volume 44 No 5, May 2008, Page 18 making the mine the second-largest coal export mine in the country, as well as the largest underground coal mine of the country. The estimate for production was reduced to between 320,000 and 360,000 tonnes for 2011. The coal of the mine is described as \\"New Zealand's largest known deposit of high fluidity and quality hard coking coal\\" (a type of coal in high demand for iron smelting),Coal Mine Approved for New Zealand National Park - 'Mines & Communities' website. Environmental News Service (ENS), Tuesday 16 March 2004. Retrieved 23 September 2007. and was expected to earn around NZ$170 million in export income annually.How the West was won: Pike River on track, New Zealand Construction News, Volume 2, Issues 3, July 2007 Various setbacks occurred during late 2007 and early 2008 delaying the start of coal production. While mine operators were originally confident that production would still start in 2008 (having reached within of the coal seam in early 2008), in mid-2009 the mine was still not producing at expected levels, with the target of the first 60,000 tons of coal to be shipped having slipped to early 2010. The mine operators noted that technical difficulties with several mining machines were to blame for the delays, which also forced the company to ask for an extension from its financiers. In February 2010, the first export shipment of 20,000 tons of coal was delivered to India for use in steel production. An explosion on Friday 19 November 2010 trapped 29 workers inside the mine. Rescuers delayed entering the mine, due to the risk of another explosion. On 24 November, a second explosion occurred and it was subsequently presumed that the workers could not have survived. A third explosion occurred at 3:39 pm 26 November; it appeared to be smaller than the first two. A fourth explosion occurred on 28 November at 1:55 pm. Initial recovery efforts were abandoned after rescue robots were lost and after insolvency the Pike River Recovery Agency was formed and reentered the mine in May 2019. As of July 2020 the recovery team has penetrated over 1.4 km into the mine and recovered four original rescue robots previously lost.  Approvals history  The mine has a development and consenting history going back to the 1970s, with the first geologists and surveyors having explored the area in the 1940s. The mine is located approximately halfway between Greymouth and Reefton, close to the Pike Stream, a tributary of the Big River in a region that already has a long history of coal- and gold-mining activity. It is located on Crown land administered by the Department of Conservation, and adjacent to the Paparoa National Park. Because of the status of the land, Pike River Coal Ltd had to obtain the Minister of Conservation's agreement to an access arrangement for mining under Section 61(2) of the Crown Minerals Act 2001. On 12 March 2004, Minister of Conservation Chris Carter approved the access arrangement for Pike River Coal Ltd. The arrangement included four -wide emergency escape shafts within the boundaries of Paparoa National Park and a requirement for Pike River Coal Ltd to spend NZ$70,000 annually on conservation projects. Carter stated that the \\"safeguards and compensation\\" outweighed the inconsistencies with objectives of the Conservation Act 1987 and the relevant management plans. Due to the location, the conditions of the access arrangement included special considerations for the environment, such as minimising tree felling and a requirement to reinstate all above-ground areas after the cessation of mining. Opponents of the mine strongly criticised the approval of the access agreement, noting that the coal is not intended for domestic use but simply a commercial operation, and thus should not have been allowed to go forward in a sensitive location. Forest & Bird also criticised the fact that the Minister of Conservation chose to ignore the report from the Department of Conservation stating that the mine would be damaging to the local environment.Undermining Paparoa National Park, Conservation News, Forest & Bird, No 129, February 2003 Greenpeace Aotearoa New Zealand also criticised the project for furthering the use of fossil fuels instead of developing sustainable alternatives.  Mine operation  In October 2008, coal production started and in November 2008, Gerry Brownlee, the Minister of Energy and Resources and Minister for Economic Development, formally opened the mine. However, production was slow initially, and took until 2009/2010 to reach significant levels. The coal is mined underground, at above sea level, quarrying coal from the Brunner coal seam. The coal is taken from the mine via a 'drift', a gently sloping 5-degree tunnel long. This tunnel has taken large amounts of dynamite to create, as the rock is described as being up to four times harder than concrete. Since the coal face will be located higher than the tunnel entrance, removal of material to a processing plant away will be via a slurry pipeline (with a 35% solids share). Another major feature of the underground works is a -deep ventilation shaft. After local ground conditions were found to be worse than expected, it was excavated with a raise-bore system excavating the ventilation shaft from a pilot drill shaft. Access to the top of the ventilation shaft is by helicopter only, even during construction, as conservation restrictions do not allow roads to be built to reach this point. This shaft partially collapsed in 2008 causing further production delays. The mine also includes underground excavation for the coal slurry handling facility and mine water storage and pumping equipment, with several large galleries of up to width and height to be excavated. As of 2010, the mine has three main \\"drives\\" (shafts). Originally, once at the processing plant, coal was to be trucked to Greymouth for reshipment at the local port. On 27 November 2007, it was announced that the coal from the mine would be transported to Lyttelton for export rather than the previously proposed shipment via the Port of Taranaki. The company has reserved under contract with Toll Rail (now KiwiRail) 1.3 million tonnes of capacity for their coal on the Midland Line between Greymouth and Christchurch, which since upgrading by ONTRACK has a total capacity of four million tonnes per annum. The mine was to have about 150 full-time staff, though in 2007-2008, there were problems filling all positions, partly because of high demand for the same occupations in the Australian and international job markets. In February 2010, Pike River Mine made its first export shipment of 20,000 tonnes of premium hard coking coal to India. The mine is estimated to have generated about $80 million of economic benefits to the West Coast Region, about $13 million of that in wages. The New Zealand flag hangs at half mast on the Executive Wing of Parliament to mark the official memorial service for the 29 miners on 2 December 2010.  2010 mine disaster  On 19 November 2010, an explosion in the mine left 29 people dead from the mine's entrance. The mine is around below ground, but is primarily accessed horizontally as it lies under the Paparoa Range. Two miners more than from the mine entrance received moderate injuries after being knocked over by the blast. It was predicted it could be several days before the mine was safe enough for rescue workers to enter, as the gases inside were feared to still be explosive. When a borehole was drilled into the area where the miners were thought to be, a level of 95% methane gas was found with the remainder primarily carbon monoxide and it appeared there was little chance of finding any of the miners alive. Although families had held out hope that some of the miners may have survived, it was believed by the rescue team that all had been killed by the initial explosion. The mine had not collapsed and air was blowing freely throughout the tunnels indicating that there were no obstructions to survivors leaving the mine or indicating their presence by tapping on pipes or calling for help.Claire Harvey Never a Hope: This was not going to be Chile The Advertiser 28 November 2010 Pg 41-42 47-48 At 2:37 PM NZDT on 24 November, a second explosion occurred, which was so severe that later that afternoon Peter Whittall (CEO of Pike River Coal Ltd) announced that it was extremely unlikely that any of the miners were still alive, as the magnitude of the second explosion and the high levels of toxic gases were too great for anyone to be able to survive. A third explosion occurred at 3:39 PM 26 November; it appeared to be smaller than the first two. On Sunday, 28 November at 1:55 PM NZDT, a fourth explosion occurred. Flames and smoke poured out of the mine causing nearby scrub to catch fire. Whittall stated there was now a coal fire burning in the mine rather than a gas fire. It is unknown at this time if the actual coal seam is on fire or if it is \\"rubbish\\" coal that has been dislodged from previous explosions. A mine expert theorised that a blast furnace level of heat could have occurred within the mine, reaching over . A collapse of any part of the mine was however considered unlikely because of the strength of the construction. On 10 November 2011 charges were laid against 3 parties in the Greymouth District Court. The charges relate to alleged Health & Safety failings at the mine. At the time of writing the parties against whom the charges have been laid have been withheld. In December 2012, Prime Minister John Key said he would apologise in person to the families of the deceased, for the Government's weak regulations and inadequate inspection regime. The Minister of Labour Kate Wilkinson resigned her portfolio on 5 November 2012 following the Royal Commission's criticism of her department. Following the liquidation of Pike River Coal, Solid Energy purchased the assets of the company . The government then purchased the 3580 ha of land around the Pike River Mine. The environment minister Nick Smith announced on 15 November 2015 that the 3580 ha of land is to be added to the Paparoa National Park, and a 45 km walkway, the Pike 29 Memorial Track from Blackball to Punakaikai through the park constructed as a memorial to the 29 miners lost in the 2010 Pike River Mine disaster. .  Former holding company  Pike River Coal Ltd was listed on the New Zealand and Australian stock exchanges. It raised NZ$85 million in additional capital for expanding the mine in 2007.Pike River Coal project makes rapid strides - Ministry of Economic Development of New Zealand, Tuesday 31 July 2007 As of August 2007, over NZ$100 million had already been invested into developing the mine. The development was valued at NZ$2.3 billion and was initially held by New Zealand Oil & Gas (29% stake plus options and bonds) as well as the two Indian companies, Gujarat NRE Coke Limited (17% share), and Saurashtra Fuels Private Limited (15% share), with the two latter companies intending to buy about half the running production of the mine's coal. After the IPO, the ownership percentages changed to NZ Oil and Gas 31%, Gujarat NRE Coke 10%, Saurashtra Fuels 8.5%, with private minority shareholders holding 7.9% and the remaining 42.5% having been sold to the general public.  Economic aftermath  On 13 December 2010, Pike River Coal Ltd was put into receivership, with three partners in PricewaterhouseCoopers appointed as receivers. On 15 December 2010, it was announced that about 114 of 157 staff in the company would be made redundant immediately, with some severance benefits paid out of the remaining company funds. It was also announced that it would be unlikely that the further numbers of contracting staff also unemployed or unpaid due to the mine accident would receive any money, as they legally ranked low in the order of creditors. Pike River Coal originally stated that they hoped to be able to reopen the mine, hopefully before the completion of the inquiry. There is also some concern about the direct economic consequences of the current mine closure, as contracts for work related to the mine have been cancelled or are stalled. The mine remains closed as of the end of 2017, with no indications when or if it would reopen. Most staff have been made redundant, and many contractors are also unemployed or remain unpaid for earlier work. In early 2011, it was reported that the receiver was considering different ways of treating the remaining assets of the Pike River Mine Ltd company. While it was possible that the mine would be sold, the option of fencing the area and returning it to the Department of Conservation was a 'worst-case' possibility. On 9 March 2011, the receivers took over full control of the mine from the NZ Police. In March 2011, Solid Energy was looking at purchasing the coal rights and access arrangements. The company said that any proposal to buy and reactivate the mine would include recovery of the dead miner's bodies, if feasible. They also noted that they saw the potential need to combine underground with opencast mining at the site. With the site sitting on conservation land, this is likely to be controversial. Open-cast mining in a national Park is banned by the Crown Minerals Act. The Pike River mine reaches the Brunner coal seam at depths of 150 to 200 metres below ground level. This is deeper than other NZ open-cast coal mines and likely to be uneconomic. However, in 2014 Solid Energy decided that it was too risky to re-enter the mine to recover any remains from the mine. In August 2011, KiwiRail blamed the Canterbury Earthquakes and \\"loss of Pike River Mine volumes\\" for its poor end-of-year result in 20102011. Following the liquidation of Pike River Coal, the government purchased 3580 ha of land around the Pike River Mine. Environment minister Nick Smith announced on 15 November 2015 that the land is to be added to the Paparoa National Park, and a 45 km walkway, the Pike 29 Memorial Track from Blackball to Punakaikai through the park constructed as a memorial to the 29 miners lost in the 2010 Pike River Mine disaster. Mine re-entry During the 2017 general election, the-then Leader of the Opposition Jacinda Ardern pledged that if elected a Labour Government would support a manned re-entry of the mine with the goals of recovering bodies and investigating the cause of the explosion. Following the formation of a Labour- led coalition government, the Minister for Pike Mine Re-entry Andrew Little announced the creation of a stand-alone government department called the Pike River Recovery Agency to facilitate efforts to re-enter the Pike River mine and recover the bodies of the deceased miners. On 19 April 2018, the Minister for Pike Mine Re-entry Little entered the Pike River Mine portal with Pike Family representatives Anna Osborne and Sonya Rockhouse to demonstrate that a safe re-entry was possible. He reiterated the Coalition Government's promise to re-enter the drift in order to recover evidence and the remains of the deceased miners. Following delays, a recovery team led by Pike River Recovery Agency official Dinghy Pattinson entered the mine on 21 May 2019. Body recovery and forensic operations are expected to take several months. The occasion was marked by family members releasing 29 yellow balloons and calling out the names of those who died. Re-entry and recovery operations will consist of three phases. The first team of miners will re-enter to assess hazards and establish supporting infrastructure. A second forensically-focused mining team will then enter the mine to examine and remove any evidential material. A third team will provide mining services including gas monitoring, communications lines and ventilation bags. Once completed, the site is expected to be refurbished and handed back to the Department of Conservation.

Previously this area has had a variety of uses over hundreds of years. Originally used as stables for local gentry it has been developed into a major shopping centre. The opening of Eagles Meadow was Thursday 30 October 2008 at 10am. There is a webcam pointed at the Eagles Meadow bridge hosted by local hyperlocal site Wrexham.com.  History  Used as local gentry's stables. During World War II, the area was used as a motorpool for elements of the U.S. Army's 83rd Infantry Division. After the US Army withdrew its forces in Europe after the war, the buildings and treated surface they had created were ideal as a Horse Repository. In the early 1970s the land was divided between a large urban car park and a small retail development which included a new Asda superstore. A bridge, known locally as the Asda fly-over, was constructed to carry the town's ring road between Smithfield Road and Salop Road. After these developments, the car park was used as the main weekly market in the town, which moved from St George's Crescent (the original 'Beast Market'). Asda moved to a larger site in September 2000 and the weekly market eventually moved to a new location at the Waterworld car park. Eagles Meadow under construction A number of proposals were put forward for re-development of this land (which is close to St. Giles Church). Firstly John Lewis signed up to anchor a retail based development, which included a number of other stores and a supermarket. This development fell through, and the landowner and largest stakeholder Wrexham County Borough Council decided to put the land up for sale by tender. A large number of tenders were received and in 2003 the winner was chosen as Wilson Bowden in partnership with architects Bernard Engle. The >¬£100m development includes two large department stores, cafes, bars, restaurants and over 40 other stores. It includes a number of landmark buildings and urban plazas, including a 'Spanish Steps' style area. A number of high rise city style apartments were constructed on the town centre side of the development. Construction began in early 2006 and opened to the public on 30 October 2008. Controversy surrounded the new build, as several shops already located in the town centre moved to Eagles Meadow and closed their shops in the town centre. Stores Stores at the centre include Boots, Debenhams, Next, H&M;, JD Sports, Marks & Spencer, SportsDirect.com, Clintons, River Island.

He was a major figure of the Jewish Renaissance in Russian and Belarusian art at the beginning of 20th century. Pen's most famous student in Vitebsk was the great Jewish painter Marc Chagall. Biography Yehuda Pen was born on May 24 (June 5 Old Style) 1854 in the city of Novoalexandrovsk, known as Ezhereni in Yiddish (now called Zarasai). He was orphaned at the age of thirteen and became an apprentice to a decorative painter in Dvinsk (now called Daugavpils, in Latvia). In 1879 he went to Saint Petersburg and took the entrance exam at the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, but failed due to his lack of fluency in Russian. Despite lacking the necessary internal passport, he remained there and, in 1881, obtained permission to audit classes. His teachers included Pavel Chistyakov, Valentin Serov and Mikhail Vrubel. He was eventually admitted as a student and graduated in 1886. He returned to Dvinsk for a time, then moved to Riga, where he became involved in the local artistic circles and met Ilya Repin, who had an estate along the Dvina that was a meeting place for the Peredvizhniki. In 1891, on his friends' advice, he settled in Vitebsk and, a year later, opened a private art school that was the first Jewish art school in Belarus. He catered to many poor students who were unable to gain admission to the larger academies; all they needed was a sponsor. Pen's pupils included Ilya Mazel, Yefim Minin, Oskar Meshchaninov, Marc Chagall, Ossip Zadkine, Leon Gaspard, and El Lissitzky. The school was in operation until 1919. At that time, thanks to the efforts of Chagall, he became a teacher at the Vitebsk Art School. Pen was killed at his home in Vitebsk on the night of 28 February/1 March 1937. The exact circumstances of his death have never been clarified. He was buried in the Jewish cemetery there. The bronze bust on his grave has been stolen twice. The vast majority of Pen's major works are located in Belarusian museums and not in museums and collections in the West. A gallery devoted to his works has been created in Vitebsk. His works are also kept at the Vitebsk Museum of Modern Art and the Belarusian National Arts Museum.

Along with the entire body of Mandate legislation, they were incorporated into Israel's domestic legislation after the state's establishment in 1948, except for provisions explicitly annulled. They remain in force today with many amendments. The regulations as amended form an important part of the legal system in the West Bank. They permit the establishment of military tribunals to try civilians, prohibitions on the publication of books and newspapers, house demolitions, indefinite administrative detention, extensive powers of search and seizure, the sealing off of territories and the imposition of curfews. British Mandate In the midst of the Arab revolt, the British King made the \\"Palestine (Defence) Order in Council, 1937\\", authorizing the British High Commissioner in Palestine to enact such regulations \\"as appear to him in his unfettered discretion to be necessary or expedient for securing public safety, the defence of Palestine, the maintenance of public order and the suppression of mutiny, rebellion, and riot and for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community.\\"Palestine Gazette, March 1937, quoted by Bracha, loc. cit. In 1945, such regulations as had been introduced, and many others, were declared as the \\"Defence (Emergency) Regulations, 1945\\". They consisted of 147 regulations occupying forty-one pages of the Palestine Gazette.Supplement No. 2 to The Palestine Gazette No. 1442 of 27 September 1945. Pages 1055‚Äì1095. Professor Alan Dowty writes that the Regulations reflected the preoccupations of a colonial power facing widespread unrest and the threat of war, and effectively established a regime of martial law. A major part of the Regulations concerned military courts, which could be established by the chief military commander as he deemed necessary.Regulation 12. Also cited by Bracha, loc. cit. Such courts could try any person for offences committed under the Regulations. Trials would be conducted summarily by three military officers, with no limits to what evidence could be admitted, and no right of appeal.Regulations 13, 20, 21, 30. Also cited by Dowty and Bracha, loc. cit. Police and military officers were given authority, on the basis of a suspicion of a violation of a Regulation, to search any place or person and seize any object.Regulations 75‚Äì78. Also cited by Dowty and Bracha, loc. cit. Indefinite detention without trial could be imposed by the High Commissioner or a military commander, and any person could be deported even if they were native-born. Extensive powers of censorship, suspension of civil courts, expropriation of property, closure of businesses, and imposition of curfews were also granted. Although emergency regulation were first introduced in response to Arab rebellion, they were also used against Jewish militant organizations like the Irgun and to fight illegal immigration of Jews. The Jewish population in Palestine vigorously protested the Regulations after they were first issued. Bernard (Dov) Joseph, who later became the Israeli Minister of Justice, said that the Regulations \\"deprived [the country] of the elementary protection which the laws of any civilized country afford its inhabitants\\", while Richard Crossman, a member of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry in 1946 concluded that, \\"Palestine today is a police state.\\" Disputed revocation On May 12, 1948, two days before British rule in Palestine was to come to an end, the British King signed the Palestine (Revocations) Order in Council, 1948, to come into operation on May 14. The Order revoked a sequence of Orders in Council that included the Order under which the Defence (Emergency) Regulations were issued. The British government considered that the Regulations were thereby abolished, but the Israeli government disagreed on the grounds that the Palestine (Revocations) Order was not printed in the Palestine Gazette (which had by then ceased publication). Israeli law The Defence (Emergency) Regulations along with most of the existing Mandatory law were incorporated into Israeli domestic law by the country's Provisional State Council's first legislative act ‚Äì a reception statute known as the \\"Law and Administration Ordinance of 1948\\". The existing laws were adopted \\"with such modifications as may result from establishment of the State or its authorities.\\" As such, regulations involving immigration were excluded, and Jews whose entry into Palestine had been illegal were retrospectively legalized,Law and Administration Ordinance, 1948, Section 11. Also cited by Bracha and Dowty. but the rest of the Regulations remain intact except where explicitly annulled or superseded by subsequent Israeli legislation. Initially a few judges refused to apply the Regulations, but the Supreme Court accepted them as part of Israeli law. The Regulations were used against Jews a few times in the early state, for example in order to abolish the underground group Lehi in the wake of the Bernadotte assassination, but their primary use has been against Arabs. They were the basis of the military government imposed on Israeli Arabs from 1950 to 1966. They are also a key part of the legal framework applied in the West Bank today. Attempts to repeal or partly repeal the Regulations in 1951 and 1966 were unfruitful. In 1951 the Knesset directed the Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee to draft a bill for their repeal; however, this was not enacted, as the military government was still in force. After the cancellation of military rule in 1967, a committee was established to draw up a plan to repeal the regulations, but its work was halted by the Six-Day War. After the 1967 war, the Israeli military governor in the territories which had been occupied issued orders to the effect that existing domestic law in those places would be continued, and that they included the Defence (Emergency) Regulations, arguing that they were not revoked during the Jordanian or Egyptian administration of those areas and therefore continued to be in effect since 1945. This position was confirmed by the Israel Supreme Court. The regulations became the basis for the Israeli Military Governorate. There has been significant debate in Israel surrounding the Defence Regulations. While most of the provisions incorporated into Israeli legislation have never been invoked by the executive branch, a few have been and continue to be repeatedly invoked, \\"precipitating public and legal debates concerning the appropriate balance between security considerations and democratic premises.\\" (See Application section below for more.) Following the passage of the Counterterrorism Act, 2016 by the Knesset, many of the regulations have been revoked. Application The provisions of the Regulations most frequently applied in the occupied territories are those dealing with censorship, address restriction, detention, and deportation, and closure of areas. The context in which they have been invoked is inextricably linked to the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict and has had an impact upon relations between Jews and Arabs in Israel. These provisions of the Regulations are generally invoked much less frequently within Israel itself today than was the case in the past. The provisions that apply to publishing houses and published materials allow for the summary closure of publications and restrictions on distribution. The military censor can prevent the publication not only of sensitive security material, but anything that is deemed prejudicial to public order.

It is bounded by Public Street to the north (bordering Upper South Providence), by Interstate 95 to the south (bordering Washington Park), by Broad Street to the west (bordering Elmwood), and by the Providence River to the east. History South Providence Library on Prairie Avenue The Buddhist Center of New England, south side of Public Street The area that is now Lower South Providence was originally pasture land. The area was ceded to the new town of Cranston in 1754 and did not rejoin Providence until 1868. A streetcar was added in 1865 which ran west along Public Street and then south down Ocean Street; it transformed the Lower South Side into Providence's first streetcar suburb. In the next ten years, the streets developed quickly wherever the streetcar ran. Irish immigrants had lived primarily farther north, but they began to populate the southern part of Lower Providence between 1860 and 1880 as the population of Providence doubled to nearly 105,000. Cranston ceded the Lower South Side (along with Washington Park) back to Providence in 1868. The Upper South Side attracted industry due to its proximity to downtown, while the Lower South Side had greater access to Narragansett Bay and freight lines via the Port of Providence; metal and jewelry factories, consequently, began to appear. By the 1870s, the majority of housing became duplexes rented by working class tenants. By 1900, the creation of new electrified rail lines gave the area fast transportation and ample affordable housing, and the Lower South Side thrived. Between 1900 and 1950, descendants of the previous- generation immigrants moved into newer, more affluent areas, with the increased prosperity that they had attained. After 1950, the automobile sentenced the area to a long inexorable decline. The creation of Interstate 95 under the Eisenhower Interstate System required demolition of existing buildings and severed the region's historical connection to the waterfront. Green space was lost as lots and yards were converted into driveways and garages. Street renovation resulted in the loss of tree-lined streetscapes. Residents began to look farther out for newer, more prosperous neighborhoods. Government At the municipal level, almost all of Lower South Providence is within Ward 10, though the very northwestern area of the neighborhood north of Reynolds Avenue/Saratoga Street, between Prairie Avenue and Broad Street, falls within Ward 11. Council President Luis Aponte and Mary Kay Harris represent Wards 10 and 11, respectively, in the Providence City Council. Both are Democrats.

The term is derived from the tradition of placing a seal on specified files or documents that prevents anyone from reviewing the files without receiving a court order. The modern process and requirements to seal a record and the protections it provides vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and even between civil and criminal cases. Generally, record sealing can be defined as the process of removing from general review the records pertaining to a court case. However, the records may not completely disappear and may still be reviewed under limited circumstances; in most instances, it requires a court order to unseal records once they are sealed. In the United States, some states order records to be destroyed after they are sealed. Once a record is sealed, in some states, the contents are legally considered never to have occurred and are not acknowledged by the state. The public policy of record sealing balances the desire to free named citizens from the burdens caused by the information contained in state records while maintaining the state's interest in the preservation of records that may be beneficial to the state or other citizens. In many cases, a person with a sealed record gains the legal right to deny or not acknowledge anything to do with the arrest and the legal proceedings from the case itself. Records are commonly sealed in a number of situations: *Sealed birth records (typically after adoption or determination of paternity) *Juvenile criminal records may be sealed *Other types of cases involving juveniles may be sealed, anonymized, or pseudonymized (\\"impounded\\"); e.g., child sex offense or custody cases *Cases using witness protection information may be partly sealed *Cases involving trade secrets *Cases involving state secrets Filing under seal in US court Normally, records should not be filed under seal without a court permission. However, FRCP 5.2 requires that sensitive text ‚Äì like Social Security number, Taxpayer Identification Number, birthday, bank accounts, and children‚Äôs names ‚Äì should be redacted off the filings made with the court and accompanying exhibits. A person making a redacted filing can file an unredacted copy under seal, or the Court can choose to order later that an additional filing be made under seal without redaction. Alternately, the filing party may ask the court‚Äôs permission to file some exhibits completely under seal. When the document is filed \\"under seal\\", it should have a clear indication for the court clerk to file it separately ‚Äì most often by stamping words \\"Filed Under Seal\\" on the bottom of each page. Person making filing should also provide instructions to the court clerk that the document needs to be filed \\"under seal\\". Courts often have specific requirements to these filings in their Local Rules. Ongoing litigation A Delaware background check corporation by the name of IntegraScan has filed for Declaratory Relief in both the states of Texas and New Jersey. The position of IntegraScan is that state mandated record sealing and expungements do not apply to private corporations, only state and Federal run agencies. The contention of the suits are that record sealing and expungement orders applied to corporations and private citizens violate First Amendment rights.IntegraScan Expungement Guide  Difference from expungement  Expungement, which is a physical destruction, namely a complete erasure of one's criminal records, and therefore usually carries a higher standards, differs from record sealing, which is only to restrict the public's access to records, so that only certain law enforcement agencies or courts, under special circumstances, will have access to them. A record seal will greatly improve the chance of employment, as employers will not have access to damning records. There are occasions, like expungement, where one can truthfully state under oath that they have never been convicted before. Most of the time, a record seal has more relaxed requirements than an expungement. If an expungement is not allowed with a case, then sealing a record may be the best bet. Different states have different terms for what constitutes sealing of a record.

Fictional character biography=Pre-Crisis Computo was created by Brainiac 5 to be a mechanical assistant, but instead it becomes homicidal, and attempts an uprising of machines. It creates an army of replicas and begins terrorizing the city. Calculating that a confrontation with the Legion is imminent, it redesigns itself into its ultimate form, Computo the Conqueror, and send a distress signal which will recall all Legionnaires back to Earth. When the Legion returns unaware, Computo uses its database to create a weapon which neutralizes Legion members' powers and use it against them, and turns the Clubhouse into a walking automaton. Computo forces the Legion to leave Metropolis, but not before causing the death of one of the bodies of Triplicate Girl, resulting in her becoming Duo Damsel.Adventure Comics #340 (January 1966) Brainiac 5 is finally able to defeat Computo by using an anti-matter device discovered in the ruins of the Batcave. Years later, after Brainiac 5 uses elements of its original circuitry, Computo re-emerges by possessing the mind of young Danielle Foccart. Computo is defeated when her brother Jacques uses the invisible formula invented by deceased Legionnaire Lyle Norg to become the second Invisible Kid.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 2) Annual #1 (1982). Several months later, Brainiac 5 would succeed in removing Computo from the young girl and place it within a matrix which tames the program and it becomes the Legion's majordomo--after first exploding the Legion HQ and then rebuilding and redesigning the structure in minutes.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 2) #311 (May 1984) Years later, an army of Computo replicas would try to conquer Bismoll, but are defeated by Senator Tenzil Kem and the Legion of Substitute Heroes. This fiasco, although successful, drives Polar Boy to disband the group and apply for membership in the regular Legion.Legion of Substitute Heroes Special (1985) Sometime later, after resigning from the Legion, Brainiac 5 constructs an organic body (which resembles a dwarfish version of Validus) to house Computo and help the Legion cope with his absence.Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 3) #51 (October 1988) Following the events of the \\"Five Year Gap\\", the Dominators secretly seize the lifeform and use it as a basis for their enforcer B.I.O.N.The Dominators send B.I.O.N. to retrieve the \\"Batch SW6\\" Legionnaires in Legion of Super-Heroes (vol. 4) #21 (August 1991).

Post-Zero Hour Following the Zero Hour reboot of Legion continuity, C.O.M.P.U.T.O.

C.O.M.P.U.T.O creates a portal to the 30th century, but turns against Brainiac when he assures the other Metal Men that Veridium's responsometer will be restored once C.O.M.P.U.T.O has served his purpose.

Thus Vernon is a \\"place of alders\\". Variants include Vern, Vernard, Verne, Verna, Sberna, Sberno. Vernon was introduced into England as an aristocratic surname at the time of the Norman conquest. It was adapted into Spanish as \\"Vern√≥n\\".  Earliest use as a surname  The earliest known use of Vernon as a surname dates from 1031 in Normandy, when a Hugh son of Roger de Vernon granted the church of St Peter in Fourques (probably either the present day Saint Paul de Fourques or St Eloi de Fourques) to the Abbey of St Ouen in Rouen.Luke Potter, http://vernonfamilytree.blogspot.co.uk/2014/07/roger-de-vernon-first-of- vernons.html , A few years later Hugh was recorded as one of the men consenting to a grant of land by Duke Robert of Normandy to the abbey of St Wandrille at Serville, ten miles north of Rouen.M.Fauroux, Actes des Ducs de Normandie, 911‚Äì1066, No.80 Although Hugh and his family were to become lords of the town and castle of Vernon later in the eleventh century, Hugh was not its lord at the time of this charter as the Dukes of Normandy held this title personally until 1035. In that year Duke William, Robert‚Äôs son, then granted the title to his cousin, Guy de Burgundy. The lordship seems to have passed to Hugh de Vernon in 1047 following the failed rebellion of Guy de Burgundy. Hugh survived until the early 1050s when he was succeeded as lord of Vernon by his son William.

Treason and charges of witchcraft The Douglas family was far from favoured by King James V of Scotland; Janet's brother, Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus, was the King's stepfather, and Angus had imprisoned the young James. James's hatred for Angus extended to his whole family, including Janet. After James had broken free of the Douglas family, in December 1528 Janet was summoned for treason. She was accused with others for bringing supporters of the Earl of Angus to Edinburgh in June. However, James called her \\"our lovittis Dame Jonat Douglas\\" in a licence of 1529 allowing her and a co-accused Patrick Charteris of Cuthilgurdy to go on pilgrimage and be exempt from legal proceedings. A recent historian, Jamie Cameron, thinks it unlikely that Janet went on pilgrimage, as she was the subject of a number of legal actions culminating in a charge of poisoning her husband John Lyon, 6th Lord Glamis who had died on 17 September 1528. This case was dropped and Janet was free to marry her second husband, Archibald Campbell of Skipness by the summer of 1532. However, on 17 July 1537 Janet was convicted of planning to poison the King and communicating with her brothers, the Earl of Angus and George Douglas.Cameron, Jamie, James V, Tuckwell (1998), pp. 169-181, 204-05. James had Janet accused of witchcraft against him, although it was clear that the accusations were false. She was imprisoned with her husband (who escaped but was later killed) in a dungeon of Edinburgh Castle. It was easy for James to imprison Janet, but actually convicting her was more difficult. To gain \\"evidence\\", James had Janet's family members and servants subjected to torture. Janet was convicted and burned at the stake on 17 July 1537 by Edinburgh Castle, which her young son was forced to watch. Family She was the daughter of George Douglas, Master of Angus and Elizabeth Drummond, daughter of John Drummond, 1st Lord Drummond. She married firstly to John Lyon, 6th Lord Glamis (1492‚Äì1528) and by him had issue: * John Lyon, 7th Lord Glamis * George Lyon * Margaret Lyon * Elizabeth Lyon, married 1st: John Forbes, Master of Forbes; married 2nd: Thomas Craig of Balnely; married 3rd: John Tulloch of Montcoffer; married 4th: John Abernethy.

Its motto is: Valor y Lealtad (Valor and Loyalty). History=Nineteenth century The Venezuelan Marines trace their history back to the combined marines corps of Gran Colombia which was formed in 1822 and was dissolved in 1829 following Venezuela's secession from Gran Colombia. This was surprising as the Marine Corps of the Confederation largely consisted of Venezuelans. The Marines' most notable engagement in this era was the Battle of Lake Maracaibo (1823). During this time the Marines were mostly manned by personnel by the Grand Colombian Army, and used army-style ranks while wearing naval uniforms. Twentieth century In the beginning of the 20th century, during the term of President Cipriano Castro, the Navy had a marine artillery command manned by Venezuelan Army personnel tasked to provide artillery crews aboard its vessels. After years of inactivity the Venezuelan Marines were finally reformed at Puerto Cabello on 1 July 1938 when a company was formed to provide ships detachments. A second company was formed on 8 December 1939 and a third in 1943. They were then merged into the 1st Marine Battalion (Battalion de Infanteria de Marina -BIM) Simon Bolivar, headquartered at Puerto Cabello, on 11 December 1945. This date is looked upon as the official anniversary of the marines. In February 1946 a second BIM General Rafael Urdaneta was raised at Puerto Cabello and the original BIM became the 1st battalion and was then moved to Marquetia. Marine headquarters was then located in Caracas. The third Battalion Mariscal Antonio Jose de Sucre was then formed up in 1958 at Carupano, the very same year the Marines became a full command of the Navy. In the late 1970s the Amphibious Assault Company, equipped with LVTP-7s and the Marine Anti-Aircraft Artillery Company, equipped with M42 Dusters, were raised. The 4th Battalion General Francisco de Miranda was raised in the early 1980s and initially consisted of the Amphibious Assault Company and the Marine Anti-Aircraft Artillery Company.Armed Forces of Latin America by Adrian J English In June 1962, the 2nd Marine Battalion at Puerto Cabello rebelled. The rebellion was put down by the navy and other marines from the 1st and 3rd Marine Battalions. Between 1975 and 1994 the marines underwent two new adjustments to its organization. On 11 December 2000, by presidential decree, the Marine Infantry were honored with the name Gen. Sim√≥n Bol√≠var Marine Division. On 15 October 2003 the Naval Police Command Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho was integrated into the ranks and organization of the Marines. On 5 April 2005, the Marine Corps of Engineers, was activated and was later placed directly under the General Command of the Navy by Presidential Resolution No. DG-031,764 dated 21 July 2005. In turn, the Naval Police Brigade \\"Gran Mariscal de Ayacucho Antonio Jos√© de Sucre\\" was formally reestablished as the Naval Police Command ceasing its dependence on the Division and remained attached to the Naval Operations Command directly. Organization Headquartered in Meseta de Mamo, Vargas, the estimated numerical strength of this unit is of approx. 11,000 men and women. Its mission is to \\"enlist and direct its units in order to form the disembarking force and/or support of amphibious or special operations; executing naval safeguarding and environmental policing, as well as actively participating in the national development\\". It is divided into 9 active brigades and a headquarters unit. As of 2016, Vice Admiral Giuseppe Alessandrello Cimadevilla is the current commandant of the Marine Corps.

A shrub or small tree to 10 m in height, bearing attractive, magenta-to-red, hummingbird- pollinated flowers, it is extremely poisonous ‚Äì hallucinogenic (deliriant) in smaller doses ‚Äì due to tropane alkaloid content and is used by Chilean machi (shamans) of the Mapuche‚ÄìHuilliche people in traditional medicine, as a poison and to enter trance states.

Dr. Rodolfo Amando Philippi Krumwiede, author of the Mapudungun-derived genus name Latua. Dr. Henri Ernest Baillon, author of the binomial Latua pubiflora. The plant first entered the scientific record in the mid 19th century with the publication of the Linnaean binomial Lycioplesium pubiflorum by German botanist and phytogeographer August Heinrich Rudolf Grisebach in 1854.August Grisebach, Rodolfo Amando Philippi Krumwiede, and Claude Gay (1854), Systematische Bemerkungen √ºber die beiden ersten Pflanzensammlungen Philippi's und Lechler's im s√ºdlichen Chile und an der Maghellans-Strasse (Systematic remarks on the first two plant collections of Philippi and Lechler in southern Chile and the Straits of Magellan region ‚Äì abbreviation: Syst. Bemerk.): pp. 40‚Äì41. Grisebach described the plant (under the name Lycioplesium pubiflorum) from a specimen collected by Lechler near the city of Ancud on the north coast of Chilo√© Island. The genus name Latua was published by German-Chilean naturalist Rodolfo Amando Philippi Krumwiede in the journal Botanisches Zeitung No. 33, August 1858: Latua Ph., eine neues Genus der Solanaceen (pp. 241‚Äì242), as the generic element in the binomial Latua venenosa. The current binomial, Latua pubiflora, juxtaposing Grisebach's specific name and Philippi's genus name was published by French botanist and physician Henri Ernest Baillon in Histoire des Plantes vol. 9, published in Paris in 1888 by Librairie Hachette - page 334.Plowman, Timothy, Gyllenhaal, Lars Olof and Lindgren, Jan Erik Latua pubiflora magic plant from southern Chile Botanical Museum Leaflets Harvard University Vol. 23, No. 2, Cambridge, Massachusetts, November 12, 1971 Scientific name The genus name Latua was created by Philippi by Latinising the indigenous Mapudungun (Mapuche / Araucanian) name for the plant, which exists in a number of local variants, the oldest of which is the (now obsolete) Latue-hue. This is derived from the Mapuche verb Lan 'to die', tu, a causative particle, and hue 'the instrument with which something is done', giving the meaning 'that which causes (something) to die' i.e. 'lethal' or 'deadly'.Febr√©s, P.A., 1764, Arte de la Lengua General del Reyno de Chile (publisher not given) Lima, page 528.Lenz, R., 1904, Diccionario Etimol√≥jico de las Voces Chilenas Derivadas de Lenguas Ind√≠genas Americanas pub. Imprenta Cervantes, Santiago. page 425.Valenzuela, P.A. 1917 \\"Glosario Etimol√≥gico de Nombres de Hombres, Animales, Plantas, R√≠os y Lugares y de Vocablos Incorporados en el Lenguaje Vulgar Abor√≠genes de Chile\\" Revista Chilena de Historia y Geograph√≠a, Vol. 22, page 290. Three more modern forms of the same derivation are the regional variants lat√∫e, latu√© and latuy. [Interestingly, the last of these can also designate the (unrelated) hallucinogenic plant Desfontainia spinosa, which, although psychoactive, has not been recorded in the literature as being dangerously toxic].R√§tsch, Christian (1998). The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants: Ethnopharmacology and its Applications. Rochester: Park Street Press: page 219. The Latin specific epithet pubiflora means simply 'having hairy flowers'. The binomial Latua pubiflora in its entirety may thus be translated as the deadly poisonous plant with hairy flowers. Vernacular names in Spanish The vernacular name for the plant in Spanish most frequently encountered in the literature is √°rbol de los brujos, meaning 'tree of the sorcerers', in reference to the use of the plant by the Chilean machi. This reflects the fact that, while the machi of today are usually female, historically this important r√¥le as practitioner of the sacred was often filled by transvestite or homosexual men, or intersex individuals.Latcham, R.E. 1924 La Organizaci√≥n Social y las Creencias Religiosas de los Antiguos Araucanos Publicaciones del Museo de Etnologia y Antropologia Vol. III.Faron, L.C.,1964 'Shamanism and Sorcery among the Mapuche of Chile' in R.A. Manners ed. Process and Pattern in Culture pub. Aldine Publishing Company, Chicago. The inference is that in a Mapuche culture less affected by European conceptions of gender and the sacred, an ambiguous or non-binary status was actually one of the signs or markers of sacred status. By contrast, in an ironic twist, gender-fluid individuals in the Mapuche culture of today can fall victim to discrimination.Bacigalupo, Ana (2007). Shamans of the Foye Tree. Austin: University of Texas Press. Other vernacular names recorded include palo de bruja ‚Äì 'witch tree' and palo mato ‚Äì 'tree (stick) that kills', the latter being identical in sense to the Mapudungun word latu√© (see above). Description Woody, spiny, evergreen, heteroblastic plant 2‚Äì10 m in height with one (tree) to several (shrub) trunks 3‚Äì25 cm in diameter, trunks spreading upward and outward from base; bark thin, grey-green, streaked with corky, longitudinal fissures, becoming reticulate and somewhat rough, reddish to greyish brown / buff; branches smooth, grey- green and armed with spines; branchlets cylindrical, those of current year's growth covered with yellowish-brown pubescence, glabrescent; spines rigid, erect, arising as modified branches in leaf axils, up to 2 cm in length, usually with small leaf at base and one or two minute cataphylls toward the apex; leaf blades 3‚Äì12 cm in length by 1.5‚Äì4 cm in width, finely hairy, petioles circa 2 mm long. Flowers pendent, borne in late Winter / early Spring. pedicels tomentose, 5‚Äì20 mm long; calyx 8‚Äì10 mm long, densely pubescent ; corolla urceolate (urn-shaped), magenta to red, 3‚Äì4 cm in length and circa 1.5 cm at the middle, with a densely pubescent exterior; style magenta, bearing bright green, capitate stigma; filaments of stamens magenta, attached at base of corolla for circa 8 mm and hairy at their bases, anthers purple, somewhat heart-shaped and circa 2 mm in length, dehiscing to reveal ash-grey pollen. Fruit a globose berry, a little flattened in shape and of a yellow to orange-yellow colour, circa 2 cm in diameter, seated in a densely hairy, accrescent calyx 11‚Äì16 mm in length, the lobes spreading and the calyx often splitting when the berry is fully ripe. Seeds thick, slightly longer than broad, circa 2 mm long, dark brown to black. Flower colour Unusually pale flower in which corolla venation highlighted to advantage by darker pigmentation of veins. As Plowman notes, there has been a measure of controversy concerning the colour range displayed by the flowers of Latua pubiflora.Scala, A.C. 1920, Contribuci√≥n al Estudio Histol√≥gico de la Flora Chilena IV: Latua pubiflora ( Griseb. ) Phil. in Revista Chilena de Historia Natural Vol. XXIV (4). pp. 73‚Äì78.Gunckel, L.H., Contribuci√≥n al Conocimiento de la Flora Valdiviana VI. Revista de la Associaci√≥n Chilena de Qu√≠mica y Farmacia Vol I (5), pp. 2‚Äì3. The label on the type specimen bears the Latin description flores coccinei i.e. 'flowers deep red', whereas subsequent authors have referred to them as variously 'violet',Murillo, A., 1899 Plantes Medicinales du Chile. Exposition Universelle de Paris, Section Chilenne pp. 152‚Äì155. 'red'Wettstein R. v. 1891 Solanaceae in Engler A. and Prantl K., Die Nat√ºrlichen Pflanzenfamilien, Teil IV, abteilung 3a, pp. 12 & 15. and atro- violaceus (dark violet) on the chromotaxy scale devised by Pier Andrea Saccardo. However, after observing flowers gathered from Latua plants growing in several different localities, Plowman expressed the opinion that, while there is some variation in flower colour, the flowers are usually magenta (as defined in Horticultural Color Chart 27/1).

Map of Chilo√© Archipelago and the south of Llanquihue province, being the southern portion of the distribution range of Latua pubiflora, including the city of Ancud, near which the plant was first collected. ( Map of 1903 by F.A. Fuentes, as above ). > ...the plant grows only in the narrow coastal cordillera between Valdivia > and Chilo√©, a difficult mountainous terrain with an extremely wet climate > and few roads; during the rainy season, the existing roads are nearly > impassable. ‚Äì thus Plowman, writing in 1971, adding, on page 66: > Latua pubiflora is found sporadically in the coastal mountains of southern > Chile between 40 degrees and 43 degrees latitude from the province of > Valdivia to Chilo√©. This region has...over 2540 mm (100 in.) of rainfall > annually. Latua occurs primarily in the middle elevations of the cordillera > between 300 and 900 m (900 and 2700 ft.). The range of distribution of the species thus corresponds roughly to the Los Lagos Region ( Lakes Region ), the plant occurring in all four of its component provinces: Chilo√©, Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue. The Los Lagos Region is the only area within Chile classified as having predominantly K√∂ppen climate type Cfb (Oceanic climate) according to the K√∂ppen climate classification. The indigenous Huilliche people, whose shamans possess much esoteric knowledge concerning Latua ( and, indeed, their entire indigenous flora ), call this land to which they and their plant are native Futahuillimapu - 'great land of the south'. Habitat Characteristic vegetation of Valdivian Temperate Rainforest, Parque Oncol, Provincia de Valdivia An element originally of the Valdivian temperate rainforest, Latua is to be found increasingly in areas occupied by fields and pastures as a result of extensive deforestation undertaken to produce timber and devote land to grazing. Despite this habitat loss, the species had (at the time of Plowman's writing) adapted well to the more open conditions prevailing on cultivated land - so much so that, although known from relatively few localities, it had actually become something of a weed of roadsides and open places in those localities where it was present, thanks to its propensity for suckering, spreading easily by adventitious branches from its underground parts - despite efforts to eradicate it by removing top-growth. Latua grows usually as a tall shrub along clearings and in secondary forests and can, in shaded woodland, attain its maximum recorded height of 10m. It is frequently to be found growing in association with species belonging to the genera Eucryphia (e.g. E. cordifolia and E. glutinosa), Laurelia (i.e. the single Chilean species L. sempervirens) and Chusquea (a genus of New World bamboos). Flowering season In the northern part of its range, in the provinces of Osorno and Valdivia, Latua pubiflora is Autumn-flowering and Spring-fruiting, the flowers starting to appear in October at the beginning of the rainy season and the fruits being borne in February and March. By contrast, in the southern part of its range - where there is less seasonal variation in precipitation - the plant flowers in Spring or Summer: in Llanquihue, Latua bears flowers in March, while in Chilo√© they are borne in July. Plowman further notes that, under favourable conditions, the plant may flower more than once a year, but that he and his colleagues had not observed this personally. In cultivation in the U.K., Latua is Spring-flowering, blooming in March and April (as in the wild in the province of Llanquihue).[Personal observation, substantiated by dates upon which particular photos used on this page taken]. Toxicity The marked toxicity of Latua was noted frequently in the early literature on the plant.Dragendorff, G., 1898 Die Heilpflanzen der verschiedenen V√∂lker und Zeiten.

Symptoms of poisoning Unsurprisingly for a tropane-rich Solanaceous plant, the effects produced by consumption of Latua pubiflora closely resemble those of intoxication by its infamous Old World cousin Deadly Nightshade: a dry mouth, a hot and feverish feeling in the body, eyes with greatly dilated pupils and blurred vision, frothing at the mouth ( from thickening of saliva ),Serna, Father Leandro of R√≠o Fr√≠o, Llanquihue Province, Chile, 1969 - personal communication to authors of Harvard Botanical Museum Leaflet on Latua: Plowman, Gyllenhaal and Lindgren. acute mental disturbances and 'insanity', convulsions, delirium and hallucinations.

( Curator of Museum of Natural > History, Stockholm in early 1950s ) 1970. Letter to the authors of the > Harvard Botanical Museum Leaflet on Latua: Plowman, Gyllenhaal and Lindgren. The above quotation from a letter sent by Dr. Benkt Sparre to Plowman enlarges upon the testimony of Murillo and Mariani, according to whom the most frequently mentioned antidote to Latua poisoning is Solanum nigrum L., ( known in Chile by the vernacular Spanish name hierba mora ): \\"...a decoction of mora is drunk for eight days while fasting. Compresses soaked in the infusion are wrapped about the head or neck or rubbed on the back\\". [ Note: in the absence of a voucher specimen, Dr. Sparre considered the identification of the species involved to be tentative i.e. a plant 'like' hierba mora / 'probably' a Solanum species ]. Similarly used are a species of Oxalis known locally as culle and the fruit of the shrub Rhaphithamnus spinosus ( family Verbenaceae ) - see page Rhaphithamnus - known locally as espino negro ( = 'black thorn' ). A prominent after-effect of poisoning by Latua, as first noted by Philippi in 1861, is persistent severe headaches.Philippi, R.A., 1861, Descripci√≥n de un Nuevo J√©nero de Plantas de la familia de las Solan√°ceas Anales de la Universidad de Chile Vol. XVIII (3) pp. 309‚Äì311. The self-experimentation of Dr. Sparre Few outsiders to the Los Lagos Region have experienced the effects of Latua at first hand, making Dr. Benkt Sparre's account of his self-experimentation with an infusion of Latua of particular interest. Dr. Sparre, later Curator at the Museum of Natural History of Stockholm, was, at the time of his self-experiment, Professor at the Universidad de Concepci√≥n de Chile and was living in an agricultural college in Centinela. On the evening of January 1, 1954, just before attending what he describes as a f√™te- champ√™tre, Sparre drank approximately 5cl of an infusion prepared ( apparently by himself and in the manner described by his informants ) from the green leaves and bark of Latua. The initial effects were slow to appear: after about 3 hours he noticed an extreme dryness of the mouth accompanied by a strong desire to spit, with spitting made difficult by the drying of his saliva to a froth at first whitish and later more solid ( viscous ). There was also a strong desire to urinate ( with urination itself almost impossible ). A little later, he experienced a \\"heavy\\" intoxication unlike (- and not as pleasureable as - ) alcoholic intoxication, manifesting as 'an immediate and almost complete loss of memory '. Sparre attended the party ( where he seems to have made an unsuccessful pass at a local girl ) in his bufuddled condition and was later put to bed by a friend, without having any memory of the fact. Later that night he awoke with a feeling of claustrophobia and injured himself slightly, while blundering about in a very confused state in search of the toilet, having finally to be physically restrained and locked in his room by the same friend. The following morning Sparre awoke with a strong hangover but still determined to take part in a previously-planned excursion, and believing himself to be \\"fairly clear in the head\\" - which was soon proved to be very far from the case: > I suddenly spoke to those present in a completely unknown language without > looking at anyone present. Unfortunately, I remember nothing from this > conversation, nor with whom I thought I spoke...What I remember is that I > suddenly jumped out of my chair, thinking that somebody wanted to beat me. > It was my own hand which [ had ] hung on the back of my chair which [ had ] > frightened me. [Compare disorder Somatoparaphrenia]. During the day-long excursion Sparre's consciousness alternated between periods of clarity and periods of drowsy, quasi-hallucination: > During these latter periods, I saw the forest around the road as some kind > of Russian boyar-ballet in heavy costumes. Sparre had returned to normal by the evening of January the 4th when he regained the ability to read, which had deserted him during the experience [explicable partly by blurred vision due to mydriasis]. He noted, however, that when he wrote up his journal that evening he had difficulty in keeping to the lines. [ Note: comparison of Dr. Sparre's experience with the dramatic (not to say lurid) generalised accounts of Latua poisoning of other authors referenced in Plowman's paper, suggest that the amount of alkaloids he consumed in his 5cl of Latua infusion may have been relatively small: he experiences, in general, drowsy confusion rather than raving mania, although the long duration of his \\"trip\\" and its after-effects ( several days ) and its associated patchy amnesia are thoroughly in keeping with experiences produced by tropane alkaloid-containing Solanaceae ]. Lat√∫e and Tayu : a potentially lethal confusion Tayu (on the right). Note: 1.) Latua stem spines borne singly, while Dasyphyllum stem spines borne in pairs. 2.) Dasyphyllum leaves bear a terminal spine absent in Latua leaves. 3.) Dasyphyllum leaves soon become more leathery than those of Latua, as they mature. A major cause of accidental poisoning by Latua is its unfortunate similarity (when not in flower) to the Tayu tree Dasyphyllum diacanthoides ( family Asteraceae ), the bark of which is a source of popular remedies ( both topical and oral ) for blunt trauma. The dangers of mistaking Latua for Dasyphyllum are first mentioned by Philippi in his original 1861 account of Latua: > One of his [ Philippi's informant Se√±or Juan Renous's ] woodcutters had > suffered a strong blow with the blunt end of his axe and went into the > forest to get some bark of tayu for it. He took instead Lat√∫e [ Latua ] and > drank a concoction of this poison. He became insane almost immediately and > wandered into the mountains. He was found three days later in an unconscious > state. Several days were required for his recovery, although he suffered > severe headaches for several months. Fish poison Latua was used by the Huilliche as a fish poison as late as the early years of the twentieth century: the juice of the plant (plant part unspecified, but probably that of sappy, green branches) was placed into slow- flowing rivers, causing the fish in them to become torpid and easily caught.Pomar, L. 1901 An Account of the Fishing Industry in Chile, Pan American Exposition Publication IV, pub. Imprenta Moderna, Santiago. Page 33. Plowman's indirect quotation of Pomar's reference to this practice mentions also Drimys winteri, another tree species considered sacred by the Huilliche, but it is not clear from the context whether the juices of Latua and Drimys were used separately or in combination as ichthyotoxic agents.

Padre Romualdo, a missionary in > Daglipulli, succeeded in learning that the plant is a tall shrub called > latu√© which grows in the forests of the coastal mountains. and 110 years later Plowman could still observe > ...the occurrence of Latua and its use is a closely guarded secret > surrounded by much superstition, since the plant is employed primarily by > local shamans and sorcerers in their magical healing rites. Those familiar > with Latua and its properties are very protective of this knowledge and are > unwilling to discuss it with outsiders. For this reason, little has appeared > in the literature concerning the ethnotoxicity of Latua. > The southernmost tribe [ of the Mapuche / Araucanians ], known as Huilliche > and extending to Chilo√©, are the people who know and use Latua Before the publication of Plowman's paper of 1971, Latua had usually been portrayed in the literature as a poisonous plant rather than an entheogen, documented as featuring in poisonings both accidental and deliberate: a sinister plant associated with insanity and death. Plowman changed this image by bringing to scientific attention the testimony of one Rolando Toro, a psychologist from Santiago, who is the first person recorded in the literature as having actually witnessed the consumption of Latua as an entheogen by Machi. He did so at a machitun ( curing ceremony / shamanic s√©ance ) in Chilo√©, prefacing his account thus: > Latua is used in an infusion by the shamans or curanderos, who ingest it > during nocturnal ceremonies of a magical nature.Toro, R. 1969: personal > communication to Dr. Timothy Plowman in Santiago de Chile. Prior to this, in 1953, Dr. Benkt Sparre, Curator at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm, although he never actually witnessed himself a ceremony in which Latua was consumed by Machi, had recorded the following hearsay: > According to explanations by elderly villagers of La Posada, who had not > tried latue themselves, an infusion was prepared in the evening with green > leaves and bark. It was said that only los hechiceros ( witches ) used > latue. Intoxicated and with an appropriate refill from a sub-hechicero ( > witch's apprentice ), they could dance and preach for a week. None of my > informants had seen this, but they had heard it from old people.

Lehmert for Atlas de la historia fisica y politica de Chile by Claudio Gay. Fantasy scene of nocturnal circle dance at a (European) witches' sabbath paralleling dance at Huilliche Latua ceremony [note also goat-headed Devil presiding]. La danse du Sabbat, artist √âmile Bayard: Illustration from History of Magic by Paul Christian, Paris, 1870. Palqui (Cestrum parqui) - the malodorous shrub whose branches were used to slap the patient in the Latua curing ceremony witnessed by Rolando Toro. [ Note: the brief account of a machitun ceremony given to Plowman by Rolando Toro (see above), although first-hand, based on personal observations made by the author in Chilo√©, reads more like an account relayed to him by another, although this may simply be a stylistic choice ]. Toro states that such ceremonies are always held at night and are believed to be effective in curing every type of infirmity, whether physical or mental, and likens them to \\"a witches' sabbath with curative ends\\". The night setting is readily understandable, given that Solanaceous narcotics like Latua dilate the pupils of the eye widely, as in low light intensities, a physiological effect which would make their use during the day unpleasantly dazzling for the consumer. The comparison to a witches' sabbath, however, has a literary flavour and conveys an impression of orgiastic behaviour somewhat at variance with the rather slow and sombre ceremony described, although certain parallels to conceptions of a night gathering of European witches are discernible. As in many types of New World, shamanic, curing rituals, not only the patient, but also the healer consumes \\"medicine\\": Toro describes the machi conducting the ceremony drinking doses of a Latua infusion at 20 -30 minute intervals in order to enter the altered state of consciousness in which healing is believed to be possible, before slowly beginning to sing and dance in a circle. The songs or chants consist of repetitions of the name of the plant intoxicant itself, rendered with variations of rhythm and tempo. Toro gives the following extract or sample: > Latu√© - latu√© - la - tu√© La - la - la - tu√© Tu√© La - tu√© La - a - a - a > (slowly) La - tu√© - la - tu√© - la - tu√© (fast) Toro describes the dance accompanying this rhythmic chanting as monotonous and characterised by a strange, inelegant rigidity reminiscent of catatonia [ see also Stereotypy ], the rhythms being marked by stamping of the feet and jerky movements of the head, while the arms are held out motionless \\"hanging like wings\\". This rhythmic, rather zombie-like dancing is kept up for some 4 -6 hours, interspersed with prayers which exhibit a syncretism between traditional Huilliche beliefs and Christianity - of which prayers Toro gives the following example: > Con un tiz√≥n ardiendo [ trans: With a flaming torch ] Cristo quema el mal [ > trans: Christ burns the evil ] De vientro de (...) [ trans: From the belly > of ( here the name of the patient ) ] The physical aspect of the treatment consists of three actions believed to cast out the demons of disease from the patient's body: first he or she is slapped with the malodorous branches of another poisonous, Solanaceous shrub Cestrum parqui, known locally by the name palqui ; secondly he/she is made to drink an emetic potion [ingredients unspecified] and thirdly his/her face is covered with the skin stripped from the genitals ( scrotum?) of a goat. While the second treatment is obviously designed to induce vomiting, the other two also seem calculated to have the same effect. The inference is that the demons thought to be responsible for the patient's disease are believed to be living in his / her abdomen or, more specifically, stomach. Apropos of Toro's comparison of the Latua ceremony with a witches' sabbath, the token presence of goat genitalia recalls the traditional goat formGrillot de Givry, √âmile- Jules, Mus√©e des sorciers, mages et alchimistes, Imp.

Latua use by machi in the 21st century Open capsule of Datura stramonium - known in Chile as chamico or miyaya and possessing a chemistry similar to that of Latua - revealing hallucinogenic seeds. Bacigalupo (2007) notes in her recent study of the machi that Latua use has by no means died out among the Huilliche, although attitudes to the use of hallucinogens by machi appear to have become less positive than in the past. > Some machi ingest palo de bruja (Latua pubiflora) or the seeds of the > miyaya, or chamico, plant (Datura stramonium) in order to produce > hallucinations, divine the future, exorcise evil spirits, and treat pain, > mental illness, asthma and rheumatism. Machi who do not use hallucinogens > are often critical of those who do, sometimes labelling them kalku > (=[malign] witch), because it is assumed that they will use these plants to > poison others. In this context, Bacigalupo goes on to quote one of her informants, Hortensia, a machi who does not use hallucinogenic plants because she maintains that only > ...bad machi who do not trance on their own [i.e. cannot enter shamanic > trance states without the aid of hallucinogens] use these herbs. Such a \\"purist\\" attitude and practice may be contrasted with Plowman's remarks concerning the general behaviour of machi in the 1970s and earlier : > The machi's training period is devoted to developing her psychic abilities > through various methods: intense mental concentration and meditation, > chanting, fasting, violent exercise in the form of whirling dances [compare > Sufi whirling], auto-hypnosis and the constant use of narcotics. [Italics > added.] and again: > Hallucinogenic and narcotic plants play an important r√¥le in the life of the > Mapuche shaman. These drugs are normally employed during the machitun > ceremony and are administered to the young machi as part of her education. Chemistry Latua pubiflora produces four Tropane alkaloids: scopolamine, hyoscyamine, apoatropine and 3Œ±-cinnamoyloxitropane, giving it a chemistry and pharmacology similar to those of species belonging to the New World tribes Datureae and the Old World tribes Hyoscyameae and Mandragoreae which, like Latua, are placed in the nightshade subfamily Solanoideae, and possess similar anticholinergic properties, sharing also a similar history of use as entheogens in the practice of shamanism and witchcraft.

However, during the next season, he formed a fine strike partnership with striker Chris Jones, during which he scored 17 league goals, as York won promotion to the Second Division. Seal was York City's top scorer for the 1974‚Äì75 season, with a total of 18 goals. During this season he scored a magnificent goal in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Arsenal in the FA Cup. He was joint top scorer with Micky Cave for the 1975‚Äì76 season, with a total of 8 goals. He was transferred to Darlington in November 1976, where he played for three seasons. He finished his league career with Rochdale. He made his home in York and played in local football for a number of years, working as a self-employed painter and decorator, and later as a milkman.

Early Lisps had many limitations, including limited data types and slow numerics. Its use of fully parenthesized notation was also considered a problem.

It is located within Coleman Street ward and links Poultry to Gresham Street. The street now contains mainly offices for financial companies. The nearest London Underground station is Bank and the closest mainline railway station is Cannon Street. Early history William the Conqueror encouraged Jews to come to England soon after the Norman Conquest; some settled in cities throughout his new domain, including in London. According to Reverend Moses Margoliouth, Old Jewry was a ghetto. Ghettos, areas of a city mainly or exclusively populated by Jews, were common across Europe. In 2001, archaeologists discovered a mikveh (ritual bath) near to Old Jewry, on the corner of Gresham Street and Milk Street, under what is now the State Bank of India. It would have fallen into disuse after 1290, when the Jews were expelled from England. On the west side of Old Jewry is St Olave Old Jewry; only the tower of this church survives. When it was destroyed in 1887, a Roman pavement and vases were discovered. Jewen Street, not far away, off Aldersgate, still existed in 1722. According to Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia, this was the only permitted burial ground for Jews. Also nearby is St Lawrence Jewry, a Church of England guild church on Gresham Street, next to the Guildhall. Thomas Rowlandson was born on Old Jewry in 1756. For many years, the headquarters of the City of London Police was in Old Jewry. Meeting- house There was a Dissenting chapel in Old Jewry in the 1700s. Richard Price, minister of Newington Green Chapel, was also the afternoon preacher here from 1763. Joseph Fawcett spoke there from 1785, when he began a series of Sunday evening lectures which drew \\"the largest and most genteel London audience that ever assembled in a dissenting place of worship\\".Monthly Repository (1817), 90.

Because of the unusual-sounding speech that is produced, as well as the behaviors and attitudes that accompany a stutter, stuttering has been a subject of scientific interest, curiosity, discrimination, and ridicule. Stuttering was, and essentially still is, a riddle with a long history of interest and speculation into its causes and cures. Stutterers can be traced back centuries to the likes of Demosthenes, who tried to control his disfluency by speaking with pebbles in his mouth. The Talmud interprets Bible passages to indicate Moses was also a stutterer. Partly due to a perceived lack of intelligence because of his stutter, the man who became the Roman Emperor Claudius was initially shunned from the public eye and excluded from public office. His infirmity is also thought to have saved him from the fate of many other Roman nobles during the purges of Tiberius and Caligula. Isaac Newton, the English scientist who developed the law of gravity, also had a stutter.Trubo, Richard (2001). \\"Stuttering\\". The New Book Of Knowledge - Health and Medicine: 112-123. United States of America: Grolier Incorporated. . Note: This annual was also published under the title The 2001 World Book Health & Medical Annual, United States of America: 2001 World Book, Inc. Other famous Englishmen who stammered were King George VI and Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who led the UK through World War II. Although George VI went through years of speech therapy for his stammer, Churchill thought that his own very mild stutter added an interesting element to his voice: \\"Sometimes a slight and not unpleasing stammer or impediment has been of some assistance in securing the attention of the audience...\\" The Stuttering Foundation has a list of Famous People Who Stutter. Variable expression The disorder is variable, which means that in certain situations, such as talking on the telephone, the stuttering might be more severe or less. In other situations, such as singing (as with country music star Mel Tillis or pop singer Gareth Gates) or speaking alone (or reading from a script, as with actor James Earl Jones and broadcast journalist John Stossel), fluency improves. (It is thought that speech production in these situations, as opposed to normal spontaneous speech, may involve a different neurological function.) Some very mild stutterers, such as Bob Newhart, have used the disorder to their advantage, although more severe stutterers very often face serious hurdles in their social and professional lives. Literature Alice in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll, hoped to become a priest but was not allowed to because of his stuttering. The well-known author of Alice in Wonderland, Lewis Carroll, hoped to become a priest but was not allowed to because of his stuttering. In response, he wrote a poem which mentions stuttering: Learn well your grammar / And never stammer / Write well and neatly / And sing soft sweetly / Drink tea, not coffee; Never eat toffy / Eat bread with butter / Once more don't stutter. (Excerpt from Rules & Regulations) Carroll's well-known stuttering trait is subliminally referenced in Alice, which features a Dodo character in one scene. As Martin Gardner pointed out in The Annotated Alice, the bird is drawn to vaguely resemble Carroll, and Carroll often tended to say his own real last name \\"Do-Do-Dodgson\\". A minor character in the Codex Alera series has a pronounced stutter, and it is assumed by other characters that he is simply intimidated by the situation he finds himself in. However, he soon proves that this is not the case, and that he is a brave, intelligent and resourceful young man who just happens to have a speech disfluency. After showing his competence, he is able to give reports and warnings that are taken completely seriously even though his stutter remains as strong as ever. The author David Mitchell is a stammerer and the narrator of his novel Black Swan Green is a stammering 13-year-old boy. Various problems and work-arounds for stammerers are explored in the semi- autobiographical work. Film One of the most famous stuttering fictional characters is the animated cartoon character \\"Porky Pig\\" from the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies theatrical cartoon series. The creators of Porky wanted a character with a \\"timid\\" voice. Originally, an actual stutterer voiced the pig, but could not control his stutter. Mel Blanc, who had no speech impediments, took over the role and affected the stutter. In 1991, the National Stuttering Project picketed Warner Bros. demanding that they stop \\"belittling\\" stutterers and instead use Porky Pig as an advocate for child stutterers. The studio eventually agreed to grant $12,000 to the Stuttering Foundation of America and released a series of public service announcement posters speaking out against bullying, featuring Porky saying \\"Everyone's unique and th-th-that's good, folks!\\".Porky Pig Lawsuit is No Laughing Matter In more recent times, movies such as A Fish Called Wanda (1988) and A Family Thing (1996) have dealt with contemporary reactions to and portrayals of stuttering. In A Fish Called Wanda, a lead character, played by Michael Palin, has a severe stutter and low self-esteem. His character--who is socially awkward, nervous, an animal lover, and reclusive--portrays a prevalent stereotypical image of stutterers. The three other characters in the movie generally make up the spectrum of reactions to stuttering: Jamie Lee Curtis's character is sympathetic and sees past it, John Cleese's character is polite but indifferent, and Kevin Kline's is malicious and sadistic. Upon release the film caused controversy among some stutterers who disliked the film for its portrayal of Palin's character as a pushover amid the bullying his character receives, and received favor from others who valued the film for showing the difficulties stutterers commonly face. Palin, whose father was a stutterer, stated that in playing the role he intended to show how difficult and painful stuttering can be. He also donated to various stuttering-related causes and later allowed the Michael Palin Centre for Stammering Children in London to use his name. In the 1986 movie Attention bandits!, Marie-Sophie, the main character's daughter, has a stutter.Cops And Robbers With French Rules 'Bandits' Adds Dash Of Humanity To Crime-story Formula The movie was noted for its positive portrayal of stuttering: it was presented as the heroine's distinctive trait, rather than a drawback or a disability.Movies That Portray Stuttering The 1983 movie The Right Stuff referenced the real-life stuttering problem of John Glenn's wife Annie, and how it rendered her fearful and unwilling to do a news conference during his initial space flight. As he reported in his autobiography, John Glenn: A Memoir, and as shown on-screen in The Right Stuff, her stuttering was never a problem between the two of them, he \\"just thought of it as something Annie did\\". But she grew frustrated with it, and some years later put herself through intense speech therapy and was largely successful in masking the outward symptoms of stuttering. A proud moment for the both of them was the first public speech she gave on her experiences as a stutterer. The novel (and film) One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has a major character named Billy Bibbit who suffers from a pronounced stutter. Through the story it is revealed that it has very negatively impacted his self-esteem (even leading to a suicide attempt when he stuttered through a marriage proposal and the woman laughed at him). The stutter abruptly disappears after he has sex with a prostitute that another patient smuggles on the ward. In the 1992 comedy My Cousin Vinny, a public defender (played by Austin Pendleton) tries to cross-examine the first witness introduced by the prosecution, but has a pronounced stutter and is ineffective. He is eventually fired and replaced by Vinny. In the film Rocket Science, the main character Hal Hefner suffers from stuttering. In M. Night Shyamalan's 2006 film Lady in the Water, Paul Giamatti's character has a pronounced stutter that selectively disappears when he interacts with Bryce Dallas Howard's character. In the 2012 film Parental Guidance, a major character named Turner has a light stutter which he resolved with practice. In It (2017 film), as well as the 1986 book and 1990 miniseries, the character William 'Stuttering Bill' Denbrough suffers with a severe stuttering issue, which was described as having \\"got worse since his kid brother died.\\" Throughout the movie he stutters profusely, the impediment worsening when he is scared or nervous. In the second half of the film, adult Bill has been seen to have overcome his speech impediment, but it recurs in mere seconds after Mike Hanlon calls to tell Bill the news of Pennywise's return. However, despite stuttering traditionally being associated in popular culture with weak willpower, cowardice and low intelligence, 'Big Bill' was instinctively recognized as the de facto leader of the gang, (even while his stutter was in full effect) and he shows great determination, courage, compassion, and cleverness in every iteration. In the 2006 film Buddy Boy, Aidan Gillen's character Francis deals with stuttering, isolation, poverty, and a verbally abusive mother. He helps a woman and they eventually become romantically involved. As their relationship grows, he doubts whether she truly loves him despite his flaws. A series of events happen and it is unclear whether Francis makes a discovery or is ill. The Academy Award-winning film The King's Speech (2010) also features George VI as played by Colin Firth stutter, based on original screenplay by David Seidler who also used to stutter as a child until age 16. The 2015 Indian film Su.. Su... Sudhi Vathmeekam starring jayasurya had portrayed the life of a real life person who overcomes the challenges faced in life due to stammering. Benicio del Toro's character in Star Wars: The Last Jedi known only as ‚ÄúDJ‚Äù frequently stutters. In the 2019 film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Rick Dalton, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, has a mild stutter. Television An episode of the hit TV show M*A*S*H involved a stuttering soldier who was convinced he was unintelligent and constantly harassed by his fellow soldiers - and by his commanding officer. The usually pompous Major Charles Winchester (David Ogden Stiers, himself a reformed stutterer) takes it upon himself to prove the soldier is just as intelligent (if not more, since Winchester discovers the young man has a very high IQ) as the rest of his unit, even giving him a treasured copy of Moby-Dick to read. Winchester had earlier told off the CO for mocking the stuttering, threatening to report his \\"inhumanity\\". At the end of the episode, Winchester retires to his tent and listens happily to a tape- recorded letter from his sister, who is revealed to have a pronounced stutter. Ronnie Barker's character in Open All Hours has a stutter, which sometimes gets him into trouble. His nephew mocks him for it. On South Park, a physically disabled character named Jimmy Valmer suffers a severe stutter that has been used to comic effect on the show especially when he is delivering the punchline of a joke or to make otherwise inoffensive words sound offensive which can also render him unable to get a message across until it is too late. The character Jeremy, from the late 1960s TV series Here Come the Brides and played by Bobby Sherman, is another example of a fictional stutterer on TV. Actor Nicholas Brendon, who played Xander Harris on Buffy the Vampire Slayer for seven consecutive seasons, overcame his stuttering problem and is now a spokesperson for the Stuttering Foundation of America. In the UK Channel 4 TV documentary series Educating Yorkshire one followed pupil Musharaf Asghar has a strong stutter which in the program is helped by load music played through headphones and in a follow-up program Stutter School by diagram breathing Music \\"K-K-K-Katy\\" was published in 1918 by Geoffrey O'Hara and became a huge hit in wartime America, referred to as \\"The Sensational Stammering Song Success Sung by the Soldiers and Sailors\\". Anyone who had either a stutter or a lisp was covered. The song uses stuttered lyrics in every line of the chorus, and refers to the stuttering of a stereotypically bashful suitor. Alvin Lucier's 1969 experimental piece I Am Sitting in a Room prominently features his stuttering, as well as making reference to it in the spoken lyrics: \\"I regard this activity ... as a way to smooth out any irregularities my speech might have.\\" A stylized form of stuttering has frequently appeared in popular music over the past few decades. Buddy Holly was a notable user of this technique in many of his songs, as well as supplementing the stutters with other verbal 'tics' and 'hiccups'. In some songs from the 1960s and 1970s the vocalist would rapidly repeat the first syllable of a word. An early example is The Who's 1965 song \\"My Generation\\", in which lead singer Roger Daltrey sings the line \\"Just talkin' 'bout my G-g-g-generation\\". In that particular case, the song's stuttering style provides a framework leading up to the sly lyric, \\"Why don't you just ff-ff-fffffffffade away!\\". The Rasmus used a similar technique in their song \\"F-F-F-Falling\\". Another example was the affected stuttering by Canada's Bachman-Turner Overdrive in their 1974 hit song \\"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\\". The stutter was not intended to be part of the final release, it was originally done as a joke about Randy Bachman's brother George, who stuttered. Three songs have gone to #1 on the Billboard charts that include stuttering in the lyrics. \\"Bennie & The Jets\\" by Elton John (04/13/1974), \\"You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet\\" by Bachman-Turner Overdrive (11/9/1974), and \\"My Sharona\\" by The Knack (08/25/1979-09/29/1979). \\"Sussudio\\" by Phil Collins is another song that went to #1 on 07/06/1985, but he really sings the lyric rather than stuttering through it. By the early 1980s producers were creating the same effect synthetically using tape editing and sampling of lyrics. Paul Hardcastle's 1985 song \\"19\\" features it throughout in both the spoken word and vocal segments. Remixes of songs very frequently employed the effect. Starting in the 1990s stuttering effects fell out of popular use in music. In 1995, stutterer Scatman John turned his problem into his asset and wrote the hit song \\"Scatman\\".

In 2001, \\"Stutter\\" by American R&B; singer Joe featuring Mystikal, held the number-one spot for four weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. Placebo used a stammering man's voice on their song \\"Swallow\\" featured on their 1996 debut album, Placebo. The song \\"For You I Will (Confidence)\\" by American pop singer Teddy Geiger features the line \\"forgive me if i st‚Äì stutter from all of the clutter in my head\\" The lead singer of indie band Bloc Party, Kele Okereke, has a very pronounced stutter when speaking, but it is not identifiable whilst singing. The song \\"Boom! Shake the Room\\" by DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince has a few lines featuring stuttering. Morris Minor and the Majors led by British comedian Tony Hawks reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart with Stutter Rap (No Sleep til Bedtime), a style parody of The Beastie Boys. It contains the lines, \\"'Cause rappin', it's my bread and butter/But it's hard to rap when you're born with a stutter\\". \\"Stuttering John\\" Though a stutterer might seem to be an unlikely radio star, Howard Stern hired a mild stutterer sight unseen (\\"He stutters? Hire him.\\") to conduct celebrity interviews. Known on the Stern show as Stuttering John, John Melendez worked for Stern for 15 years before taking a position as the announcer on The Tonight Show. Howard Stern also has a collection of frequent guests, many of whom have speech impediments of some type; while their afflictions are exploited for comedic purposes, members of The Wack Pack are well loved by Howard Stern and his fans. John is on the Stuttering Foundation's list of Famous People Who Stutter. Discrimination and awareness In addition to personal feelings of shame or anxiety, discrimination is a significant problem for stutterers. The majority of stutterers experience or have experienced bullying, harassment, or ridicule to some degree during their school years from both peers and teachers who do not understand the condition. It can be especially difficult for stutterers to form friendships or romantic relationships, both because stutterers may avoid social exposure and because non-stutterers may find the disorder unattractive. There is evidence of negative attitudes to people who stutter on the part of employers and the general public. In a survey of people who stutter,Rice M, Kroll R. The impact of stuttering at work: challenges and discrimination From International Stuttering Awareness Day Online Conference 2006. Retrieved 2011-02-26 67.6% of respondents believed their capabilities had at times been misjudged by supervisors, and 28.3% considered they had not received a job promotion due to their stutter. Accordingly, stuttering may be legally classified as a disability in many parts of the world, affording stutterers the same protection from wrongful discrimination as for people with other disabilities.Tyrer, Allan. Disability discrimination links. Different jurisdictions have different tests and it will depend on whether these are met in the particular case. People who stutter may, for example, be protected in the U.S. by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (and/or by state/local legislation),Parry, William D. Stuttering and the Law. or in Great Britain by the Equality Act 2010,Tyrer, Allan. stammeringlaw.org.uk. through the person either having a disability as defined or being 'regarded' or 'perceived' as having one. The Australian Human Rights Commission says stuttering is within the Australian Disability Discrimination Act 1992.Australian Human Rights Commission. Frequently asked questions: Who is protected by the DDA? Retrieved 2011-02-25 Legal protection from disability discrimination sometimes extends beyond employment discrimination, for example to provision of services and education, and may include a right to reasonable accommodation. The U.S. Congress passed a resolution in May 1988 designating the second week of May as Stuttering Awareness Week, while International Stuttering Awareness Day (ISAD), is held internationally on October 22. In September 2005, ISAD was recognised and supported by over 30 Members of the European Parliament (MEPS) at a reception given by the European League of Stuttering Associations. Even though public awareness of stuttering has improved markedly over the years, misconceptions are still common, usually reinforced by inaccurate media portrayals of stuttering and through popular misconception. A 2002 study focusing on college-age students conducted by the University of Minnesota Duluth found that a large majority viewed the cause of stuttering as either nervousness or low self-confidence, and many recommended simply \\"slowing down\\" as the best course of action for recovery. While these misconceptions are damaging and may actually worsen the symptoms of stuttering, groups and organizations are making significant progress towards a greater public awareness.

Dictionnaire d‚Äôhistoire et de g√©ographie du Japon. (in French/German). * The senior or main branch of the Itakura was created 1609. After the Battle of Sekigahara, the Itakura were given significant responsibilities in the evolving shogunal government. Itakura Katsushige (1542‚Äì1624) was made the Kyoto shoshidai in 1601; and he continued to hold this high office during the next twenty years. During this period, Katsushige saw significant increases in the revenues allotted to him by the shogunate. His importance within the shogunate can be measured by the record of grown in his annual expected income which rose to 40,000 koku; however, he had no castle in his charge. As compensation of sort, Katsushige was given the title Iga no kami.Papinot, p. 16. Itakura Shigemune (1587‚Äì1656) was the oldest son of Katsushige; and he succeeded to the office of Kyoto shoshidai in 1620. He would continue to hold this office through 1654. Two years later, he became daimy≈ç at Sekiyado Domain (50,000 koku) in Shim≈çsa province. Itakura Shigesato (1620‚Äì1660), the oldest son of Shigemune, was known as Awa no kami and he held the shogunate title of Jisha-bugy≈ç. His descendants would reside successively at Kameyama Domain in Ise Province in 1669; at Toba Domain in Shima province in 1710; at Kameyama in Ise Province in 1717; and finally, from 1744 through 1868, at Matsuyama (50,000 koku) in Bitch≈´ Province. The head of this clan line was ennobled as a \\"Viscount\\" in the Meiji period. * A cadet branch of the Itakura was created in 1624 for the progeny of Itakura Shigemasa (1588‚Äì1638), the second son of Itakura Katsushige. He was honored with 15,000 koku from the revenues of Mikawa province in acknowledgment of his conduct during the Siege of Osaka in 1615. Subsequently, Itakura Shigenori (1617‚Äì1673), the son of Shigemasa, was the Osaka jodai and r≈çj≈´, and then Kyoto shoshidai in 1668. In 1672, he received the fief of Kasuyama (60,000 koku) in Shimotsuke province. Itakura Shigetane (1640‚Äì1705), the son of Shigenori, was installed in 1680 at Iwatsuki Domain in Musashi province, and in the following year, he was transferred to Sakamoto Domain in Shinano province. Later, Itakura Shigehiro was established at Fukushima Domain (80,000 koku) in Mutsu province where his descendants remained up through the Meiji Restoration in 1868. The head of this clan line was ennobled as a \\"Viscount\\" in the Meiji period. * Another cadet branch was created in 1661. The members of this clan resided successively in 1681 at Annaka Domain (15,000 koku) in K≈çzuke province; in 1702 at Izumi Domain (20,000 koku) in Mutsu province; in 1746 at Sagara Domain (25,000 koku) in T≈çt≈çmi province; and eventually, from 1749 through 1868 at Annaka Domain (30,000 koku) in K≈çzuke province.

It was named after a mining warden, Lionel Gee.Mr Reg Sprigg cited by Recently Mount Gee came to prominence in 2008 - 2011 because of uranium exploration occurring in an area that was commonly (and mistakenly) believed at that time to be protected from all mineral exploration. This situation was altered in 2011 - 2012 when the Government of South Australia created the Arkaroola Protection Zone and passed the Arkaroola Protection Act (2012) which prohibits all mining activity in the Arkaroola Protection Zone. Mount Painter No. 6 workings, on a spur of Radium Ridge, to the south of Mount Gee. The mine was opened in 1911 for the extraction of radium. Uranium mineralised breccia at Mount Gee  Geography  With its peak rising 600 metres above sea level Mount Gee is one of several peaks located in the visually spectacular and geologically significant range north-east of the Gammon Ranges and south of the Mawson Plateau. Mount Gee was entered on the Register of the National Estate in 1982 due to its \\"spectacular mass of quartz crystal and vughular, lining the cavities of crush breccias\\".  History  Mineral exploration in the Mount Painter region began in the 1860s with the discovery of copper at a number of sites in the region, including the Yudnamutana copper field and the Lady Buxton mine, and numerous small diggings throughout the Mount Painter area. Professor Sir Douglas Mawson first identified samples of torbernite (a copper uranium phosphate mineral) in samples brought to him in 1910 by the Greenwood brothers from what is now called Radium Ridge. Various syndicates were formed in 1911‚Äì1935 to try to exploit the radium from Radium Ridge (immediately to the west and adjoining Mount Gee). During World War II investigations into the area of Mount Gee- Mount Painter were carried out by the Commonwealth Government, and the No.6 workings (see adjoining photo) was developed, as well as a number of workings in the East Painter Gorge (immediately to the north of Mount Gee-Mount Painter) and Yudnamutana Gorge. Sporadic exploration occurred during the 1950s adjacent to Mount Gee, culminating in the efforts of Exoil NL and Transoil NL during the late 1960s and early 1970s. It was during this exploration phase that the \\"Ridgetop\\" track was constructed. The numerous exploration tracks across the southern and north-eastern faces of Mt Gee were constructed by Exoil-Transoil at this time. Exploration ceased during the 1970s as a result of large uranium finds elsewhere and the \\"Three mine policy\\" introduced by the Federal Government in the early 1970s. CRA resumed exploration in the area during the early 1990s, focusing on the Streitberg Ridge and Armchair Basin areas, immediately to the north of Mount Gee, as well as other areas within the Arkaroola Sanctuary. Bonanza Gold Ltd pegged an exploration license over the Mt Gee area in the early 2000s. Several exploration holes were drilled into the Mount Gee-Mount Painter area before Marathon Resources took over the project and intensified the exploration efforts, focusing once again on the southern and northeastern sides of Mount Gee, by opening up many of the (still existing) Exoil-Transoil tracks. None of the uranium deposits have been proven to be economic, although Marathon Resources claim that the Mount Gee deposit complies with a JORC inferred and indicated resource of 31,400 tonnes of U3O8, potentially the sixth largest known uranium deposit in Australia.  Tenure and legal status  The Arkaroola Protection Zone in which Mount Gee is located, is situated in the Arkaroola pastoral lease. The pastoral lease was purchased by Reginald and Griselda Sprigg in 1967 for the purposes of \\"wildlife preservations and conservation of the environment\\", with this objective being recognised by the South Australian Government initially in 1969 and again (after a long period of limbo) in 1996 with the property being granted official status as a wilderness sanctuary. This status was reinforced with the inclusion of the Mount Gee area within the \\"Environmental Class A Zone\\" defined in the South Australian Development Plan, which has as its objectives: \\"The conservation of the natural character and environment of the area\\" and \\"The protection of the landscape from damage by mining operations and exploring for new resources... Mining operations should not take place in the Environmental Class A Zone unless the deposits are of such paramount importance and their exploitation is in the highest national or State interest that all other environment, heritage or conservation considerations may be overridden. Deposits which may potentially have the required degree of significance have been identified in the following localities only: > the western face of the Heysen. Ranges [sic]; portion of the Moralana > Valley; portion of the Mount Hack and Mount Uro areas; portion of the > Stirrup Iron Range; portion of the east Gammons and the Mount Painter- > Freeling Heights area [my emphasis].\\" which includes the Mt.Painter and Mt. > Gee areas. Following the public outcry that resulted from Marathon Resources' misconduct in the Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary -- including the illegal dumping of a small amount of waste in several shallow pits and the alleged excavation and removal of mineral specimens unrelated to the mineral exploration program, the South Australian government promised to introduce legislation to ban all mining activities in the sanctuary, with the premier stating that \\"we have decided to give the region unprecedented protection\\", and dismissing suggestions from Marathon Resources that the government may be liable for compensation claims by Marathon Resources. Any and all mining in the entire Arkaroola Protection Zone is now prohibited, including Mt Gee and the Mt Painter inlier. This protection is provided by the South Australian Arkaroola Protection Act (2012).  Recent developments  Mining company Marathon Resources gave notice on or around 14 September 2007 of its intention to apply for a mining lease allowing extraction of uranium ore from Mount Gee. To satisfy the environmental objectives cited above the application forwarded by the proponent indicates an underground mine (as opposed to open-cut) which would be serviced via a tunnel allowing access to infrastructure and processing facilities located away from the immediate vicinity of the Arkaroola area, on the plains near Lake Frome. The proposal is opposed by the owners and operators of Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary in which the proposed mine would be locatedMedia release by Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary, cited in as well as conservation and anti-nuclear groups.Media release by Australian Conservation Foundation, cited in In January 2008 the owners of Arkaroola Wilderness Sanctuary were alerted to environmental contamination at Mount Gee. An investigation by the South Australian Government found that around 22,800 plastic and calico bags containing exploration samples, drilling material, cardboard and paper waste, plastic jars, PVC pipe, packing and other material were buried by the drilling contractor in two large trenches approximately 35 metres long x 4 metres wide x 2.7 metres deep.PIRSA investigation report, hosted on Under the terms of the EWA and DEF, Marathon was required to pour remaining drill samples back down drillholes, however this is often impossible as the drillholes quickly become plugged with sample. If the samples cannot be poured back into the drillholes it is then permissible to bury them, however the sample bags and any other rubbish must be removed. Under ARPANSA regulations, any radioactive samples must be buried with a minimum of 50 cm of soil. In addition Marathon Resources have admitted in a subsequent Rectification Plan the company was required to submit that twenty drums of samples were buried in a nearby site, as well as various food packaging and personal protective equipment waste at another nearby site. There is also evidence that samples of fluorite have also been removed from the side of Mount Gee. There is no evidence to suggest that Marathon or its contractors were responsible for this. The removal of mineral specimens from the Mount Gee area has been ongoing since before the Arkaroola Sanctuary opened in the late 1960s, and collectors have prised prized examples of green and purple banded fluorite, Fluorite pseudomorphs, \\"nailhole Quartz\\" and \\"Cowstitite\\" from the outcrops of Mount Gee, aided by the continued ease of access via the well- maintained \\"Ridgetop Track\\" 4WD tourist route (see photo above). In response to this investigation the SA Minister for Mineral Resources Development found this method of disposal of non-drill sample waste constituted a \\"significant breach of exploration licence conditions\\" and suspended the exploration licence granted to Marathon Resources to conduct mineral exploration on Mount Gee.Minister Holloway's Ministerial Statement, hosted on Marathon then spent considerable time, effort and money in recovering the dumped rubbish and dril samples, which were then transported to the Hawker rubbish dump for disposal. Additionally, many of the drillsites and access tracks were rehabilitated as best as possible. However, in October 2009 the Government granted a 12 month exploration licence to Marathon Resources. On 27 October 2009, the Rann Government released a draft management Plan for the Northern Flinders Ranges, called 'Seeking in Balance'. According to its opponents this Plan allows for mining activity right in the heart of the Arkaroola Sanctuary, including Mount Gee. After the exploration Licence was re-granted, Marathon Mining conducted low-impact exploration, including stream sediment sampling and some geophysics for a time, concluding some time before the Arkaroola Protection Act was passed in 2012, prohibiting all mining activity in the Arkaroola Protection Zone. Marathon was awarded a $5 million compensation payment by the South Australian Government. Marathon had spent in excess of $15million on their Mt Gee exploration program.

Prior to his role as CEO, Whittall held the position of General Manager Mines and was responsible for on-site construction, mine development and recruitment at the Pike River operation. Whittall became the company spokesperson during the mining disaster. The previous head of the company was Gordon Ward, who was managing director and CEO from May 2007 until 1 October 2010. Until his departure, Ward had led Pike River Mine from its initial conceptual design for fourteen years. History The company raised NZ$85 million in additional capital for expanding the Pike River Mine in 2007. As of August 2007, over NZ$100 million had already been invested into developing the mine. By June 2010, Pike River Coal had invested a total of $288 million in developing the mine. Pike River Coal reported net operating losses of $39 million in the year to June 2010, and $13 million in 2009. Prior to the mine disaster, Pike River Coal Ltd had a market capitalisation varying around NZD400M. Pike River Coal was initially held by New Zealand Oil & Gas (29% stake plus options and bonds) as well as the two Indian companies; Gujarat NRE Coke Limited, (17% share), and Saurashtra Fuels Private Limited, (15% share), with the two latter companies intending to buy about half the running production of the mine's coal.How the West was won: Pike River on track, New Zealand Construction News, Volume 2, Issues 3, July 2007 After the initial public offering, the percentages changed to NZ Oil and Gas 31%, Gujarat NRE Coke 10%, Saurashtra Fuels 8.5%, private minority shareholders had 7.9% and the remaining 42.5% was sold to the public. On 12 December 2010, New Zealand Oil & Gas released a statement saying that it had decided to put Pike River Coal into receivership. On 13 December 2010, New Zealand Oil And Gas stated that Pricewaterhouse Coopers had been appointed receivers. The company was purchased by Solid Energy in 2012, although the government is responsible for investigation and re-entry into the mine.

XEWA broadcasts on 540 kHz, a Canadian and Mexican clear-channel frequency.  History  XEWA received its concession on December 2, 1948, one of a string of repeaters of XEW-AM 900 Mexico City authorized in the late 1940s. XEWA began operations on the frequency of 540 kHz with 150,000 watts of power ‚Äî still its current levels, making it the most powerful AM radio station in the country. In May 1961, a second XEWA-AM was licensed to operate in Monterrey, Nuevo Le√≥n, in order to provide daytime XEW service and an improved nighttime signal there. It operates with 1,500 watts during the day and 1,000 watts night. On March 16, 1988, XEWA struck out on its own with a grupera format known as S√∫per Estelar WA. Broadcasting from Monterrey, S√∫per Estelar was programmed by Multimedios Estrellas de Oro and served as one of Mexico's pioneering grupera stations. After five years, S√∫per Estelar left XEWA and migrated to XHSNP-FM in San Luis Potos√≠, which was owned directly by Multimedios; it was also carried on some Multimedios radio stations in other cities until the format became known as La Caliente. The end of S√∫per Estelar made way for a flip to the Ke Buena format from Radi√≥polis (now Televisa Radio), which lasted into the late 1990s when the station began repeating XEW again, now known as \\"Cadena W Azul y Plata\\" and later as \\"W Radio\\". In 2003, Radiorama began managing the station for Televisa Radio. 2009 saw the first ever split between XEWA Monterrey and XEWA San Luis Potos√≠. The San Luis Potos√≠ station was transferred to local radio company MG Radio, while XEWA Monterrey began offering a Nuevo Le√≥n-specific version of W Radio; ever since, XEWA Monterrey, now on FM as XHWAG-FM, has been a separately programmed station which is currently operated directly by Televisa Radio. In San Luis, XHEWA-FM 103.9 was authorized in 2011 and came on the air that July; while it is technically an AM-FM migrant, the AM station cannot be shut off until radio service is available in the entirety of its coverage area, including ten municipalities in five states with no other radio service.List I of stations that must remain on AM ‚Äì IFT Pleno 2014 In 2012, Radiorama returned to manage XEWA/XHEWA, and in July, W Radio was replaced with Los 40 Principales. Radiorama's regional affiliate in Tampico, Grupo AS, took over the San Luis Potos√≠ region in 2016 and operated it until December 31 of that year. On January 9, 2017, GlobalMedia, which also had begun programming Ke Buena in San Luis Potos√≠ on XHBM-FM, took over operations of XHEWA after the station spent several days directly relaying XEX-FM Mexico City.  Coverage  XEWA-AM is a 150 kW clear-channel station, which covers the Mexican states of San Luis Potos√≠, Nuevo Le√≥n, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Zacatecas, Quer√©taro, Guanajuato and Aguascalientes.

In 2013, there were 198,839 immigrants living in Romania, of which 13,000 were refugees. Immigration is expected to increase in the future, as large numbers of Romanian workers leave the country and are being replaced by foreigners. According to DIICOT, Romania has evolved since 1990 from a country of transit for illegal migrants to a country of destination. Within the European Union, the country has the second highest rate of immigration from non-EU countries (86%), just behind Slovenia (90%). Most immigrants in Romania are from Europe, West Asia, and East Asia, with small but growing communities from South East Asia, South Asia, Africa, Central Asia, North Asia, North America, Latin America, The Caribbean, and Oceania. In Romania there are also refugees from Afghanistan, Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East, South Asia, Myanmar, and Venezuela. Republic of Moldova Over half of the country's foreign-born residents originate from Republic of Moldova. Owing to the former period of union between most of Moldova and Romania, many Moldovans are eligible for Romanian citizenship on the basis of descent. The culture of Moldova is influenced primarily by the Romanian origins of its majority population, being strongly related to classical Romanian culture, and, as such, it is easy for people from neighbouring Moldova to integrate within the contemporary Romanian culture. Many immigrants from the Republic of Moldova prefer to settle in the Romanian counties from the region of Moldavia, because there the culture is more similar to their home country.https://adevarul.ro/news/societate/analizA-vin-cei-mai-imigranti-fac- romania-1_5bf516f1df52022f75a9438f/index.html EU countries Immigrants from Italy and Spain often have close relations with Romanians, including intermarriage (see also Romanians in Italy and Romanians in Spain).

The Yellow Sam betting coup was a successful sports betting coup, widely remembered within Irish and British thoroughbred horse racing. It happened at Bellewstown on 26 June 1975, and was orchestrated by Barney Curley, an Irish professional gambler, philanthropist behind a charity for impoverished children in Zambia(which he set up after his son's death in 1995), former trainer, former Jesuit seminarian, failed pub owner, former pop group manager, and entrepreneur. By taking advantage of an under-handicapped horse and the lack of easy communications between the Bellewstown racing course and off-course bookmakers, Curley made a profit of over IR¬£300,000 (>‚Ç¨1.7m adjusted for inflation) ‚Äì one of the largest betting coups in Irish history.Bellewstown Races website ‚Äì History . Accessed 22 September 2007.Hyland, F (2006); Taken For A Ride: Betting Coups And Scandal, Gill & Macmillan (). Barney Curley again made headlines when four horses linked to him won on 22 January 2014, and were estimated to have cost bookmakers \\"something in the region of ¬£2million\\", reportedly just the latest of many successes since the Yellow Sam coup. The coup Yellow Sam was a \\"slow but steady\\" horse bought by Curley and was given his name from his father's nickname at the races. Curley instructed the horse's trainer, Liam Brennan, to train Yellow Sam specifically for the somewhat obscure annual National Hunt race at Bellewstown, featuring mostly amateur jockeys. To ensure that the horse would run at least once with a much lighter handicap than would normally be the case, Curley first ran the horse in a series of races on other tracks in unfavourable conditions.Curley, B; Townsend, N (1998); Giving a little back: An Autobiography, HarperCollins (). Curley spent weeks developing the plan and putting people in place. On the day of the race, Yellow Sam's starting price was 20‚Äì1, but if large sums of money were being placed on the horse, that figure would drop quickly, drastically reducing the coup's potential take. It was for this reason that Yellow Sam was to race at Bellewstown specifically, as the track was serviced by just two telephone lines, one public telephone box and a private telephone line belonging to the Extel company which supplied racing data to betting shops. The Extel line was put out of use [probably cut] early in the day leaving just one telephone line available to communicate to the course bookies who determined the starting prices for the participants.Sim, A (21 March 2004); The top 10 sporting gambles, The Times. URL last accessed 21 September 2007.Wood, G (24 April 2004); \\"Curley finally finds his vocation\\", The Guardian. (Available online at Buzzle.com. URL last accessed 21 September 2007). Dozens of Curley's friends, acquaintances, and paid accomplices stood in bookmaker's shops across the country with between ¬£50 and ¬£300 and sealed instructions to be opened upon receiving a call. None of the accomplices knew beforehand which horse had been prepared, or in which race it was to run. Curley called six or seven of his people at 2.50 pm, ten minutes before the race was to start, and instructed them to each call ten to twenty others. In all, Curley invested just over ¬£15,000, his entire savings, in the gamble. Twenty-five minutes before the race was about to start, and fifteen minutes before the bets were to be placed, Benny O'Hanlon, a friend of Curley's in on the plot, walked into the telephone booth and pretended to place a call to a dying aunt in a non-existent hospital. His act was convincing, as the queue behind him waiting to use the telephone sympathetically allowed him to continue talking for half an hour, while off-course bookies desperately trying to lay off their liabilities struggled in vain to contact their counterparts on the course. Curley had already built up something of a reputation during his years as a professional gambler, and knew that his presence at the course was likely to cause concern amongst the bookies, and possibly give away the coup before the off. Still, with so much at stake he wanted to see the race first-hand, so he crept into the centre of the course and watched the race concealed in a thicket of gorse. The gamble succeeded, with Yellow Sam winning the 13-hurdle race by two and a half lengths. Since nothing about the coup had been illegal, the bookmakers were forced to pay out the full IR¬£300,000 (>‚Ç¨1.7m adjusted for inflation). They did, however, pay out the winnings in single notes, filling 108 bags. Aftermath The coup made Barney Curley widely known throughout Ireland and the United Kingdom, and made headlines in many Irish and British national newspapers and television reports. To this day, it continues to be listed as one of the greatest betting coups of all time. Curley invested his earnings in a stable of horses which he continued to have trained for specific gambles, and in the purchase of Middleton Park House, a mansion in Mullingar, County Westmeath ‚Äì for which he later ran a raffle of dubious legality (though his jail sentence for illegally running a lottery was overturned on appeal), earning him over ¬£1m. Irish bookmakers amended their rulebook following the coup to require that bets of over ¬£100 be placed at least half an hour before the start of the race. Bellewstown Race Course itself played up the coup in later years, and in 2005 ran the \\"Seamus Murphy Yellow Sam 30th Anniversary Hurdle\\", inviting Barney Curley and Liam Brennan to observe the celebrations.McClean, D (9 July 2005); \\"Beating the odds at Bellewstown \\", Irish Farmers Journal. Retrieved 21 September 2007. en iyi bahis siteleri Yellow Sam continued to run in other races, and in his autobiography, Curley reported having earned a further ¬£700,000 in bets on the horse before it was retired. Barney Curley again made headlines when four horses linked to him won on 22 January 2014, and were widely reported to have cost bookmakers \\"millions\\", with a spokesman for British bookmakers Joe Coral admitting they had cost Coral \\"a six-figure payout\\" and estimating \\"the industry has been hit for something in the region of ¬£2million\\".

She was a central figure in the Gutai Art Association, although her painting and performance art received relatively little international attention until the early 2000s, when she received her first solo show. Biography Tanaka was born in Osaka, on February 10, 1932. She went to several local art schools where she worked in mostly figurative mode. The schools she attended were the Art Institute of Osaka Municipal Museum of Art in 1950, and from 1951 on, the Department of Western Painting at Kyoto Municipal College of Art (now Kyoto City University of Arts). There, she made friends with a man named Akira Kanayama, who helped her explore new artistic territories. In 1955, she joined the Gutai group, an avant-garde artists' movement, to which she belonged until her marriage to Akira Kanayama in 1965. In the same year, Tanaka left Gutai with Kanayama and they moved into a house at the temple Myo*ho*ji in Osaka. She produced most of her works at home and in the second floor of her parents‚Äô house, which was ten minutes away from where she had lived. In 1972, Tanaka and her husband moved from Osaka to Nara.

Involvement with the Gutai movement In 1952, Akira Kanayama introduced Tanaka to his colleagues in an experimental art organization which he had founded called Zero-kai (Zero Society); she soon joined this association. In the meantime, a skillful easel painter named Jiro Yoshihara had been offering private lessons in Western-style oil painting. After being influenced by the many abstractionists in Tokyo, Yoshihara had developed a new kind of art practice that would, in his words, ‚Äúcreate things that have never existed before.‚Äù In 1954, Yoshihara, accompanied with his young colleagues founded the Gutai Art Association. Gutai artists had been known to be one of the first to carry out ‚Äúhappenings‚Äù; the physical actions they were involved in were documents of the actions, and the actual performances of the pieces. This brought on a new type of art, known today as performance art. Their creations weren‚Äôt influenced by doctrinaire theory; they focused more on playful, whimsical inventions. Similarly, Tanaka had displayed the same type of whimsical inventions through her work. Tanaka participated in both the 1st and 2nd Gutai Art Exhibitions in 1955 and 1956, presenting her iconic works Work Bell (1955), Work (Yellow Cloth) (1955), and Electric Dress (1956). Work Tokyo Work (1955), reconstructed in 2007. Tanaka‚Äôs pieces can be seen as abstract works that rejected conventional notions of how works of art should appear or ‚Äúperform.‚Äù Tanaka's works, which include abstract paintings, sculptures, performances and installations, generally feature objects from everyday life: textiles, door bells, light bulbs and similar. One of these pieces, called Work Bell, produced in 1955, consisted of a string of electric bells laid out around the border of a gallery; the piece included a button for visitors to press which consequently set off a chain of shrieking rings. In another of her works, Work (Yellow Cloth), executed in 1955, Tanaka took long pieces of plain, dyed fabric and tacked them to a gallery's walls, creating 'paintings' that removed any suggestion of human handling from their forms and surfaces. Her piece, Stage Clothes, produced in 1956, consisted of gigantic stick-figure frames draped with fabric and light bulbs, and a large red dress with long sleeves. This was a multi-part ensemble that she wore at a Gutai performance. She peeled off each layer rapidly in a costume-changing routine. Tanaka literally inserted her body into the work of art, making herself a part of the performance. Her best-known work is the performance piece, Electric Dress from 1956. Documentation of this piece shows Tanaka, with only her face and hands visible, clothed in a veil-like garment made of close to 200 hand- painted lightbulbs. Here, the work lights up sporadically, giving off the sensation of an alien-like creature and, according to Tanaka, \\"blinks like fireworks.‚Äù According to the Gutai artists, Tanaka's work symbolized post-war Japan‚Äôs rapid transformation and urbanization. She had noticed the trepidation when she had worn it and flipping the switch: \\"I had the fleeting thought: Is this how a death-row inmate would feel?\\" In 1950s, people recognize and distinguish gender difference from the surfaces of clothing. However, Tanaka's work was an attractive design that did not distinguish between for male or female on the surface of the clothing. Although Gutai was ahead of the times, her artistic ability was evaluated through the recognition that she is a woman. For instance, another member of Gutai, Shozo Shimamoto said ‚ÄúAmong these few examples of avant-garde art, Tanaka' s work has taught me about an aesthetic sensitivity that I did not have, especially an alternate possibility of rigorous beauty that can be created from womanly sweetness and frailty. They were a great influence on me.‚Äù Some reviewers criticized that a factor of her success is because her unwomanly and dynamic style. In the 2000s, Tanaka's works were featured in numerous expositions in Japan and abroad, including at the Kyoto National Museum of Modern Art, the Nagoya Gallery HAM, the New York Grey Art Gallery and Paula Cooper Gallery as well as at the Galerie im Taxispalais in Innsbruck. The Grey Art Gallery focuses on Tanaka's Gutai period and also includes a video and documentation of the movement plus a reconstructed version of Electric Dress. In 2005, the University of British Columbia's Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery in Vancouver mounted a major exhibition of Tanaka's work entitled \\"Electrifying art: Atsuko Tanaka, 1954-1968\\". Electric Dress and other works were on display at the 2007 documenta 12 in Kassel. Atsuko Tanaka's work is included in a number of internationally important public collections, including that of the Museum of Modern Art, MOMA,in New York. MOMA's online collection (see external links) features a large, untitled 1964 Tanaka work (synthetic polymer paint on canvas). Nearly tall and over wide, this piece, according to MOMA's online description, \\"evolved from Tanaka's performance Electric Dress\\", and \\"vividly records the artist's gestural application of layers and skeins of multicolored acrylic paint on the canvas as it lay on the floor.\\" See also *Wearable art References * Atsuko Tanaka; Ming Tiampo; Mizuho Kato; Morris and Helen Belkin Art Gallery.

The crest-tailed mulgara is among a group of native predatory mammals or mesopredators endemic to arid Australia.Pavey, C. R., Nano, C. E. M., Cooper, S. J. B., Cole, J. R., & McDonald, P. J. (2012). Habitat use, population dynamics and species identification of mulgara, Dasycercus blythi and D. cristicauda, in a zone of sympatry in central Australia. Australian Journal of Zoology, 59(3), 156-169. doi:10.1071/ZO11052  Description  The crest-tailed mulgara is a small to medium-sized mammal with sandy coloured fur on the upper parts leading to a darker grey on the under parts and inner limbs.Woolley, P.A. (2005). The species of Dasycercus Peters, 1875 (Marsupialia: Dasyuridae). Memoirs of Museum Victoria, 62(2), 213‚Äì221. The species is strongly sexually dimorphic with adult males weighing 100 g to 185 g and females weighing 65 g to 120 g. Head-body length of 125‚Äì230 mm and tail length is between 75‚Äì125 mm. Identification between the two species within the genus Dasycercus has proven difficult with the crest-tailed mulgara (Dasycercus cristicauda) often confused with the brush-tailed mulgara or ampurta (D. blythi). Tail morphology is a primary identifying feature between the two species. The crest-tailed mulgara has a crest of fine black hairs along the dorsal edge of the tail creating a fin-like crest and hair length tapering towards the tip. In contrast the brush-tailed mulgara tail hair is not crested, black hair starts half way along the upper surface of the tail and dorsal hair length remains consistent. Nipple count also differs between the two species and is another distinguishing feature. The female crest-tailed mulgara has eight nipples compared to the brush-tailed mulgara who only has six.Menkorst, P. & Knight, F. (2011). A field guide to the mammals of Australia. Melbourne, Victoria, Australia: Oxford. p. 52-53. .  Taxonomy  There has been taxonomic confusion within the genus Dasycercus described by Peters in 1875. Four named forms of carnivorous marsupials have been assigned to this genus. Kreft, 1867, first described Chaetocercus cristicauda in 1877. A second form, Phascogale blythi was described by Waite, 1904, followed by a third form, Phascogale hillieri described by Thomas, 1905. Jones 1923, described two species of mulgara Dasycercus cristicauda and D. hillieri. but decades on, William Ride‚Äôs 'A Guide to the Native Mammals of Australia' published in 1970 referred only to a single species, Dasycercus cristicauda, and in 1988 Mahoney and Ride placed all three species in the synonymy of D. cristicauda. A fourth species, Dasyuroides byrnei, described by Spencer, 1896, was included by Mahoney and Ride however a lack of consensus resulted in its exclusion to the genus Dasycercus. In 1995 Woolley described two sub-species, D. cristicauda cristicauda and D. cristicauda hillieri, which were later confirmed to be two species using mitochondrial gene sequencing by Adams, Cooper and Armstrong in 2000. Woolley resolved the taxonomic and nomenclatural issues in 2005 and the species was re-named to two genetically distinct forms, D. cristicauda previously D. hillieri or the Ampurta and D. blythi previously named D. cristicauda or the Mulgara.  Distribution  The crest-tailed mulgara inhabits areas of arid Australia. It has been recorded in the southern Simpson Desert near the tri-state border and in the Tirari and Strzelecki Deserts of South Australia and the western Lake Eyre region. Historically the species‚Äô geographic range was much larger incorporating areas from Ooldea on the eastern edge of the Nullarbor Plain and the Musgrave Ranges in South Australia, Sandringham Station in Queensland (last record in 1968) and from the Canning Stock Route and near Rawlinna on the Nullarbor Plain in Western Australia. Owl pellet examinations showed presence of crest-tailed mulgara near the southern and south-eastern margins of the Strzelecki dunefield/sandplain, in the Flinders Ranges and at Mutawintji National Park in far-western New South Wales.Letnic, M., Feit, A., Mills, C., & Feit, B. (2016). The crest-tailed mulgara (Dasycercus cristicauda) in the south-eastern Strzelecki Desert. Australian Mammalogy, 38(2), 241-245. doi:10.1071/AM15027 Due to the levels of taxonomic uncertainty, misidentification may have led to an overestimated distribution especially when based on older records. This has created difficulties in assessing and interpreting temporal changes within its historic distribution.Woinarski, J. & Burbidge, A.A. 2016. Dasycercus cristicauda. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2016: e.T6266A21945813. http://dx.doi.org/10.2305/IUCN.UK.2016-1.RLTS.T6266A21945813.en. Downloaded on 05 June 2018  Ecology and Habitat = Habitat  The crest-tailed mulgara inhabits crests and slopes of sand ridges, or around salt lakes in inland Australia. During the day it shelters in burrows which are located at the base of sandhill canegrass (Zygochloa paradoxa) clumps or Nitre bush (Nitraria billardieri) growing around the edges of salt lakes. Burrow site suitability, rainfall, food resources and the fire age of the vegetation community may be a factor influencing their distribution.  Diet  The crest-tail mulgara is an opportunistic or non-specialist carnivore, eating a range of insects, arachnids and rodents but also includes reptiles, centipedes and small marsupials. It forages along the dune crests and flanks with forays down onto the swales.  Breeding and reproduction  The crest-tailed mulgara reaches sexual maturity in the first year. Reproduction occurs between winter and early summer raising up to eight young in a litter. Independent young are found in spring and early summer  Conservation Status  alt= The following are the federal, state and international listings for the crest- tailed mulgara. The mulgara was presumed extirpated in New South Wales for more than a century, but was re-discovered in 2017 in Sturt National Park north-west of Tibooburra.  Federal Listing Status  Under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (the EPBC Act): Listed as Vulnerable.  Non-statutory Listing Status  IUCN: Listed as Near Threatened (Global Status: IUCN Red List of Threatened Species). WA: Listed as P4 (Priority Flora and Priority Fauna List (Western Australia)).

SA: Listed as Endangered (National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972), June 2011.  Threats  The crest-tailed mulgara is sensitive to predation by the European red fox and feral cat, changes to fire regimes together with environmental degradation and habitat homogenization attributed to grazing from livestock and introduced European rabbits. During post-release of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), the crest-tailed mulgara underwent a 70-fold increase in its extent of occurrence and a 20-fold increase in its area of occupancy.Pedler, R.

The Telephone Girl and the Lady is a 1913 American silent drama film directed by D. W. Griffith. Plot A telephone operator is walking out with a handsome police sergeant; her father insists that the husband for her is a plump, comfortable grocery store owner. The Lady picks up her jewels from the jewellery and brings them home, followed by a jewel thief on a stolen bicycle. She puts them in her safe, and goes to give the telephone girl a present of a necklace in thanks for her work. As the Lady answers the telephone and accepts the Telephone Girl's effusive thanks, the door creaks open ‚Äì it is the masked thief! She tells the girl on the other end of the line that she's being robbed. While the thief grills the lady, the telephone girl calls the police, but there's a riot and calls about that prevent her getting through. She runs out of the exchange and spots the sergeant conveniently riding by. He lifts her onto his horse and they gallop to the rescue. Meanwhile, with an implicit rape threat the thief has forced the lady to reveal the safe concealed behind a picture. Just in time, the sergeant bursts in as the thief escapes with the jewels. After a rousing fight, helped by the feisty telephone girl and neighbours including a lady in a huge hat, the sergeant drags away the thief. The lady rewards the sergeant and the lovers fall into each other's arms.

A number of units of the Confederate Army of Tennessee trained in the camp before it was abandoned under pressure from the Union invasion of central Tennessee. Training camp Camp Trousdale was a convenient site for training soldiers. The area had previously served as a station on the Louisville & Nashville Railroad. and was located in relatively close proximity to a major city, Nashville, Tennessee. It also had a temperate climate and was close to large open fields which were convenient for the training of volunteers who would later serve in the Army of Tennessee. Camp Trousdale and similar sites such as Camp Moore in Louisiana were often the places where raw volunteers received their first training in military drills, in the form of intense daily practice. Trousdale also served as a staging area for the military campaigns along the Tennessee-Kentucky border. Felix Zollicoffer, who was appointed commander of Camp Trousdale in July, 1861, used units from the camp to strengthen Confederate defenses near the Cumberland Gap. This campaign led to Zollicoffer's death when he mistakenly crossed into Union lines during a battle near Mill Springs, Kentucky in which the Confederate troops were pushed back into Tennessee. As with many military camps during the war, disease was a common problem. One of the units that used the camp early in its existence was the Third Tennessee Infantry Regiment. The regiment was moved to the camp in hopes that a change of venue would relieve an epidemic of measles and other diseases that had beset its soldiers. However, even after its move to the camp on July 16, 1861, the soldiers of the Third Tennessee suffered from a variety of illnesses. This prompted the construction of a military hospital, although the hospital was located in a tent rather than a more permanent building. Archaeologists have speculated that the hospital site may provide modern researchers with a variety of artifacts related to the military, medicine, burials, and domestic life. Despite the vagaries of training, disease, and what one soldier described as \\"mighty tight rools\\" (sic), the occupants of Camp Trousdale found time for recreation. One Tennessee soldier wrote that dances were a nightly event at the camp. The camp was abandoned in November 1861 due to the Union invasion of middle Tennessee.

Dietzen was a successful amateur winning the German cyclo-cross championship in 1980 and 1981 as well as winning in road races. He turned professional with the Swiss team Puch in 1982. He won the cyclo-cross race the Grand Prix Jean Bausch-Pierre Kellner that year. The following year he joined a Spanish cycling team Teka with whom he would stay with for the rest of his career. In his first year with his new team he won the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana. The following year he became the champion of Germany in the road race and cyclo-cross as well his first stage victory in the Vuelta a Espa√±a. He won the stage to the Lagos de Covadonga which is a very steep climb and a prestigious stage to win. He would finish that year's edition of the Vuelta third overall. The following year he was again cyclo-cross champion as well as the winner of the Vuelta a Cantabria. In 1986 he was again German road champion and won a second stage in the 1986 Vuelta a Espa√±a. In 1987 he wore the leader's jersey in the 1987 Vuelta a Espa√±a for five days before losing it to Herrera and then finishing the race second overall to Luis Herrera of Colombia. Dietzen finished the 1988 Vuelta a Espa√±a second overall, this time to Sean Kelly of Ireland. In the 1989 Vuelta a Espa√±a, Dietzen won a stage but several days later he crashed. He had ridden into a tunnel which was not illuminated and crashed, suffering career-ending injuries. He was only 30 years of age when the following year he stopped as a professional after not recovering. Seventeen years later, the Supreme Court of Spain ordered the organisers of the Vuelta a Espa√±a to pay damages to Dietzen. Dietzen obtained nearly all of his success in Spanish races with wins in Vuelta a La Rioja, Vuelta a Castilla y Le√≥n and the Setmana Catalana de Ciclisme. From 2003, Dietzen was a directeur sportif with the now- defunct Team Gerolsteiner. He lives in Spain.

History=Endeavour High School Endeavour school from Beverley Road (2011) Endeavour High School was created in 2001 from a merger of two existing schools: William Gee and Amy Johnson. In the same year the planning process began for a new school on the site of the former Kingston General Hospital, together with sports facilities on a former council depot site. It moved to a new ¬£15 million site on Beverley Road in 2003, construction of the school was funded by cash raised by the sale of shares in Kingston Communications by the City Council. A sports facility north of the school in Temple Street, Stepney was also built. In March 2004 Endeavour was placed in special measures, following an inspection by Ofsted. The school came out of special measures in December 2005. The school was placed in special measures again in 2009. In the five years to 2009 the school's pass rate improved from 9% to 35%. In 2010 the school achieved its best ever GCSE results with 73% of students leaving with 5 A*‚ÄìC and 99% of pupils leaving with at least 1 GCSE A*‚ÄìG, or equivalent pass. It was reported in 2011 that the council was considering closing the school and using the site for a work training centre. The school was put in special measures for a third time in 2012. Endeavour High School logo By 2013 the school had only 500 pupils out of a capacity of 1200, with the school population expected to fall further; in addition the school had failed to find a sponsor for it to gain Academy status; the low pupil numbers made the school financially unviable. Additionally, between 2005 and 2013 the City participated in the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme, refurbishing or rebuilding over 20 schools; and many other secondary schools had spare places (2011). As a result, Hull City Council began examining the case to begin the closure procedure. In November 2013 Hull City Council announced a consultation on the possible closure of Endeavour High School. The council proposed to transfer pupils in years 7, 8 and 9 to different schools in September 2014, with full closure of the school commencing in August 2015. In March 2014 Hull City Council formally made the decision to close Endeavour High School as of summer 2015. The remaining 210 students continued with their GCSEs while the other 170 switched schools. In June 2015 it saw the last of its 101 pupils leave, with the school officially closing on 31 August 2015. Endeavour Learning and Skills Centre In May 2014 HCC Training announced plans to offer adult education and training courses from the site, starting September 2014; as well as opening the sports facilities up for community use. As a result, adult education provision at a number of sites in the city ceased and transferred to the Beverley Road site in September 2014. After Endeavour High School closed in June 2015 the site was renamed Endeavour Learning and Skills Centre.

After the sale of the Nokia mobile devices division to Microsoft, the website was renamed Lumia Beta Apps.http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-closes-nokia-acquisition-2014-4 It was discontinued in 2015. The service was revived by HMD Global in 2017 for Nokia Android smartphones, allowing members to test Android 8.0 Oreo beta.  Overview  Nokia Beta Labs homepage in 2008 The applications provided by Beta Apps are in development, but are considered \\"mature\\" enough to be released in order to be tested by users worldwide. Anyone can submit feedback about applications, which goes to the development team. After a period of time, an application either \\"graduated\\", meaning it is released as a final version, or is removed from the site and placed in an archive. The site facilitates beta applications being developed by Microsoft or select 3rd party developers for Lumia products. The applications are, of reasonably good quality, but may have rough edges and occasional service breaks, not commercialized yet, not guaranteed, and not officially supported, under active development, free of charge and not be used for commercial purposes Applications may graduate to become commercial offerings, or they will be archived along with the lessons learnt based on user feedback.

Nokia phones beta labs was launched as Nokia Beta Labs on 16 April 2007 only as a page linking to other Nokia beta applications, namely Sports Tracker, Wellness Diary and WidSets. On 13 August, Nokia employee Tommi Vilkamo announced the website's renovation and his role as the new Beta Labs manager on his blog. After the rebranding Microsoft collecting feedback through UserVoice and has since launched several new applications such as Cinemagraph Beta and Gestures. Originally the site was operated by Nokia but Microsoft moved the development to a more feedback-orientated design in August 2014 to allow more users to add their feedback rather than just Nokia- developers.https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/17/5912289/microsoft-kills-feature- phones-in-favor-of-windows-phone On 14 August 2014 it was announced the relocation of the Nokia Beta Labs website to a new site that host all new beta trials for Lumia apps. Microsoft has discontinued the Nokia Camera Beta trial and re-released the Beta app as \\"Lumia Camera Classic\\" while implementing the new features in the Lumia Camera app, and has added OneDrive integration to Lumia Cinemagraph (formerly Nokia Cinemagraph) after first trialing it in the Lumia Beta Apps site. On 25 February 2015 Join Conference (previously Nokia Conference) was made public for all Windows Phones but republished under the Microsoft Garage and reduced the number of markets it was available in. In May 2015 Microsoft released the Lumia Camera Beta app reminiscent to the Nokia Camera Beta app to test improvements, among the new features is the ability to select Office Lens from settings. Though these features are exclusive for newer PureView powered handsets, these devices include the Nokia Lumia 930, Nokia Lumia Icon, Nokia Lumia 1520, Microsoft Lumia 640, and Microsoft Lumia 640 XL. On July 22, 2015 Microsoft launched a new version of the Lumia Creative Studio called Lumia Creative Studio Beta that added support for living images if the photographs were captured with the Lumia Camera.

History Once just simply known as Hesdin, this little village was, in the Middle Ages, a large and prosperous town. Its position in the heart of the county of Artois, once part of the Spanish Netherlands, led to its downfall. From 1471 until its destruction in 1553, it suffered many sieges and sackings, as a result of fighting between the Kings of France, the Holy Roman Empire, Henry VIII of England and several French nobles. The end of Hesdin, as it was then known, was at the hands of Charles V. His 60,000 strong army had already ravaged Metz and razed Th√©rouanne in April 1553 and he ordered the city and the castle completely destroyed. A month later, the wreckers had finished their work. Only the convent and chapel were spared. Some months later, the demolition material was used to found a new city 6 kilometres downstream, at a village then called Maisnil. This new town took the name Hesdin-fert, then Hesdin-fort, eventually becoming Hesdin. The ruined town was known for a while as Hesdin-le-Ch√¢tel, then eventually as Vieil- Hesdin (Old-Hesdin).

Biography  He was probably born at Viktring in Carinthia, the son of Otto von Keutschach, a judge at the manorial court (Hofrichter), and Gertrud von M√∂derndorf. The Keutschach family came from the northern shore of Lake Keutschach. Their arms are a white turnip on a black field. Leonhard started out as canon of the Augustinian order and provost of Eberndorf Abbey. In 1490 he was promoted as provost of the Salzburg chapter and in 1495 was elected prince-archbishop. In 1498 he again expelled the Salzburg Jews, who had returned to the area since their banishment in 1404, and had their synagogues at Salzburg and Hallein destroyed. The City of Salzburg was politically unstable, after in 1481 Emperor Frederick III of Habsburg had granted its citizens the privilege to elect its own council and mayor, which was the cause of a protracted struggle with the ruling archbishops. In 1511, Leonhard ended the unrest: He invited the mayor and councillors for a gala dinner, had them imprisoned and forced them to renounce their rights. He proceeded to cement his position with nepotism, nominating relatives in key positions; he however had to accept Matth√§us Lang von Wellenburg, a former secretary of Emperor Maximilian I of Habsburg as coadjutor bishop. Leonhard died at Salzburg, spending his last years unsuccessfully battling his coadjutor, who would succeed him in 1519. Leonhard was an effective ruler, he reformed the archbishopric's finances, paying off old debts and developing the economy by farming out, increasing the salt production, the silver and gold mines and promoting trade. His efforts made Salzburg one of the richest states of the Holy Roman Empire, starting a long tradition of a local culture rich in music and art. Leonhard also used his wealth to buy back lands sold by his predecessors to cover their debt and to support Emperor Maximilian I financially, which brought further economic and political advantages. He expanded the defenses of the city, notably by strengthening Hohensalzburg Castle and a large number of castles in Salzburg and Carinthia. He ordered the construction of river dams around Hallein to protect the city from spring floods, but he also had the Radst√§dter Tauern Pass road and a number of new long distance routes constructed to promote trade. He crowned his economic achievements by a coinage reform (R√ºbentaler) that was the basis for the modern Salzburger monetary system. A decree promulgated by Archbishop Leonhard in 1504 was one of the earliest actions in Europe to officially protect threatened animal species, including the northern bald ibis, which nevertheless became extinct in Central Europe.

Description The school was built in 1923 as a Rosenwald school, one of seven such schools eventually built in Sumner County. Construction of Durham's Chapel School began shortly after the Cairo Rosenwald School was started. The Rosenwald Fund provided $700 toward the cost of construction, and the remainder of the $3750 cost was split evenly between the Tennessee public school fund and the local African-American community. The building design was a standard Rosenwald Fund plan for a two-teacher school with an industrial room. It is a one-story building on a limestone block foundation with weatherboard siding and a shingled cross-gable roof. It has decorative details inspired by Craftsman architecture, including wide-overhanging eaves and exposed rafter tails. The school interior includes two classrooms separated by moveable partitions that could be opened to create a larger space for school presentations and community events. An industrial room projects from the center of the building. The industrial room was used for home economics instruction. Heat for the building was provided by a single wood-burning stove. Most of the original elements of the building were extant as of 2006, including cabinets, doors, moldings, hardware, chalkboards, the wood-burning stove, and a wooden stage at the southwestern end of the building. The kitchen sink, refrigerator, and cooking stove in the industrial room were installed in 1955 after the Brown v. Board of Education decision led Sumner County officials to allocate some funds to improve facilities in the county's segregated African-American schools. History The Durham's Chapel community was formed by former African-American slaves in the early years after the Civil War. Durham's Chapel Baptist Church was founded in 1866 by the Reverend Peter Vertrees, a mulatto who helped establish numerous African-American churches and schools in Middle Tennessee. Land for the church and school were donated by a local man named Rodney Durham. The Durham's Chapel church building, located adjacent to the school, was completed in 1870 and is still in use. The Rosenwald school was the third black school to be established in the Durham's Chapel community. The earliest one-room school was destroyed by fire. The second school, known as \\"The Little Red School House\\", was built before 1900 at a site east of the church building; it was used until the Rosenwald school was completed. Throughout its history, the school was closely associated with Durham's Chapel Church, while also receiving government support. White people in Sumner County supported the school's home economics training program for girls in order to qualify them for employment as domestic servants. The school closed in 1962, but the building still stands and is currently used by the church for meetings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. By that time, only three of the seven Rosenwald schools in Sumner County (including Cairo Rosenwald School and Durham's Chapel School) were still standing. A restoration project was completed in 2012 at a cost of $40,000. ReferencesExternal links *Edwards, Holly. \\"Rural black schools vanishing but still teach.

Best known for his Neo-Gothic style. Best known as Architect of the Old Louisiana State Capitol, Old Bank of Louisville, and other public buildings.  Early life  Daikin was the son of James (1783‚Äì1819) and Lucy Harrison Dakin (1784‚Äì1826) of Hudson, New York, and born in Northeast Township. He was seventh in line from the immigrant ancestor, Thomas Dakin, of Concord, Massachusetts, through Simon, of the third generation, who went to Putnam County, New York, from Massachusetts. After learning the carpentry trade from his uncle, James Dakin moved to New York City, where he was apprenticed to Alexander Jackson Davis when the firm of Town and Davis, Architects, was formed in 1829. That year he married Joanna Belcher (1796‚Äì1882) of Norwich, Connecticut, the widow of George Collard. They had seven children including two pairs of twins, with just two children surviving to adulthood.Descendants of Thomas Dakin of Concord, Mass. by Albert H. Dakin, accessed 14 May 2015. Old Bank of Louisville building in 1987 Dakin seems from an early date to have developed a practice of his own, for he was the architect of the large J. W. Perry house, in Brooklyn, in about 1830‚Äì31, and of the Washington Square Dutch Reformed Church, an unusually advanced example of Gothic Revival work. He also was in touch with Minard Lafever during this period and, a beautiful draftsman drew a number of the plates, which are signed by him, in Lafever's The Modern Builder's Guide. Apparently, too, he had some means. From May 1, 1832, to November 1, 1834, he was a partner of Town & Davis (now renamed Town, Davis and Dakin, Architects), and from existing accounts of the firm, he seems to have contributed a generous amount of working capital. The partnership ended in some disagreement; a letter from Ithiel Town to Davis indicates that Dakin, owing to his investment in the firm, considered he had a greater right to dictate policies than the older partners could countenance. During this period Town & Davis were engaged on many important works, including the North Carolina State Capitol (1832), the main building of New York University (1833; an influential Gothic collegiate work for which Dakin and Town did most of the design), and the Marine Pavilion (a luxurious hotel) at Rockaway; Dakin's name appears as one of the architects of the last two.  Life as an architect  It was at this time that the firm employed James Gallier for some four months at $2.00 a day.Gallier in his Autobiography somewhat optimistically gives the figure as $4.00, but the firm accounts are definite. Here Gallier met Dakin's younger brother, Charles Bingley Dakin (1811‚Äì1839), then working as a draftsman at James Dakin's firm and whom Gallier took along to New Orleans in 1834. That year, having left Town, Davis and Dakin to establish his own firm in New York, Dakin designed one of the finest buildings of his career, the Bank of Louisville in Kentucky, as well as the First Presbyterian Church in Troy, New York, done in the Greek Revival style. In 1835, James Dakin followed his brother and Gallier to New Orleans. Ambitious, he realized, as Gallier had, the opportunities New Orleans offered. For a time there seems to have been a loose partnership between the three. One example of their collaboration is Barton Academy in Mobile, Alabama, started in 1835.Gamble, Robert Historic architecture in Alabama: a guide to styles and types, 1810‚Äì1930, page 57. Tuscaloosa, Alabama: The University of Alabama Press, 1990. . Both James Dakin and James Gallier claimed to have been the architects of certain New Orleans buildings of the period. Within a year, however, the Dakins left Gallier and practiced for time together as Dakin & Dakin and as Dakin, Bell & Dakin; later on they split. Charles began an ill-fated branch office in Mobile, where he supervised the construction of the Government Street Presbyterian Church, completed in 1836. The collapse of a row of warehouses he designed affected him so deeply that it is thought to have been a cause contributing to his early death in St. Gabriel, Louisiana. He had gone to Texas to begin anew. That year (1839) the Great Fire of Mobile also destroyed much of the firm's incomplete work there. James Dakin's work with Gallier (1835) included Christ Church, the front of which is preserved as a Knights of Columbus clubhouse (1835‚Äì37), the Verandah Hotel (1837‚Äì38), and the Merchants' Exchange (1835‚Äì36) on Royal Street. In 1838 he designed St. Patrick's Church, an ambitious effort in a rich Gothic style, supposedly modeled on York Minster. When difficulties occurred in its construction, Gallier was called in to revise the foundations and Dakin lost the contract in 1839. Ever afterward Gallier erroneously claimed it as one of his buildings.The disagreement centered around the construction methods used by Dakin for the partially completed church. A panel of arbitrators, headed by the Anglo-Irish Gallier, met to render a finding. Several other panelists, who were Irish-American builders and contractors, joined with Gallier to dismiss Dakin; they subsequently gave the job to Gallier. Dakin appealed the resulting court case and won in the Louisiana Supreme Court, but by the time of the judgment the church, which was owned by its Irish parishioners, was bankrupt as a result of the panic of 1837. Dakin was forced to declare bankruptcy in 1841, partially as a result of the St. Patrick's Church matter. Dakin was also architect of the Methodist Episcopal Church (burned with the St. Charles Hotel), of \\"Union Terrace\\" (1836‚Äì37) on Canal Street, of the State Arsenal (1839), and of the gracious row of thirteen houses on Julia Street known as the \\"Thirteen Buildings\\" or the Julia Street Row. At this time, too, Dakin, Bell & Dakin were employed as the architects of a proposed city hall for New Orleans, but the project was abandoned and the architects paid and discharged by the City Council on March 28, 1837. The relation of this design to Gallier's later City Hall, if any, is not known. There is also evidence that the Dakin brothers were the architects of several unidentified buildings in Cincinnati and St. Louis. James Dakin carried on after his brother's death, designing the Gayoso House Hotel in Memphis, Tennessee (1842), and the Medical College of Louisiana (1843). By 1845 he had accepted as an apprentice Henry Howard, among the best of the next generation of Louisiana architects. After 1848 James lived chiefly at Baton Rouge. Old Louisiana State Capitol During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War James H. Dakin served briefly in 1846 as colonel of the 2nd Louisiana Volunteers. He returned to design the University of Louisiana, adjacent to the Medical College. The latter was absorbed by the university, and the entire complex ultimately became Tulane University. In 1847 he won a competition for the new statehouse with a daring Gothic design, a style he chose \\"because no other style ... could give suitable character to a building with so little cost\\" and because to use classic would give a building \\"which would appear to be a mere copy of some other edifice already erected and often repeated in every city and town of our country.\\"Diary in the Library of Louisiana State University. Having moved to Baton Rouge, he supervised the capitol's construction until 1850. Dakin left the capitol job with only interior detailing unfinished to become the architect for the New Orleans Custom House. He found the original design by Alexander Thompson Wood unsatisfactory and proposed instead a freestanding, cast-iron frame and a central courtyard for air circulation. But a political and sociological dispute arose between Creole and Anglo-Saxon factions over the changes. To create the courtyard for air and ventilation, Dakin proposed moving the main banking room from the center to the Canal Street front. The Creoles of the French Quarter objected that that would give the Anglo-American sector across Canal Street a business advantage. Creole Democratic congressmen debated the change on the floor of Congress. Dakin, a friend of the Whig president, Zachary Taylor, was ousted after a heated hearing in which the great architect Isaiah Rogers sided with Dakin. He returned to Baton Rouge, where he completed the capitol interior. He died there after \\"a long and painful illness.\\"New Orleans Daily Picayune, 18 May 1852, p. 2. As a designer Dakin was forceful and original and his influence was disseminated in many ways. The Perry house in Brooklyn (remarkable for its conservatory wings) and the Julia Buildings show a competent use of the current Greek Revival forms. But it is in the Gothic of St. Patrick's and the Old Louisiana State Capitol that his originality best appears; the interior of the former, with its intricate plaster ribbing and cleverly top-lighted sanctuary, and the varied and forceful masses of the latter, together with its original plan and fancifully delicate woodwork (renewed after a fire in 1887), reveal him as a man with marked imagination. The location of his major buildings in highly visible places, like the Mississippi River levees in Baton Rouge, Memphis, and New Orleans‚Äîthe river was the highway of the time‚Äîand the New York University campus in New York City helped draw attention to his highly imaginative designs and set lofty professional standards. Dakin also provided many engravings for Minard Lafever's architectural books, which became builders' handbooks all over America. Dakin had been honored in the 1830s by an invitation to become one of the founding members of the American Institution of Architects, forerunner of the American Institute of Architects. The spread of ideas on architecture and mutual support marked their activities. NotesReferences * \\"James Harrison Dakin\\". Dictionary of American Biography, Supplements 1‚Äì2: To 1940.

History The hospital's foundation was laid on 5 April, 1930 by the Governor of Malta, John Philip Du Cane, in the presence of then Prime Minister, Gerald Strickland. Progress in the construction of the hospital was slow due to technical difficulties encountered. By 1939, at the onset of the Second World War, the hospital was still incomplete and the work was suspended. In 1941, the main block was converted into an isolation hospital for infectious diseases. The hospital, by then given the official title of St. Luke's Hospital, dealt with several epidemics ranging from measles to typhoid, typhus, poliomyelitis, scabies and ringworm. By the late 1940s the hospital assumed its role as a general hospital with facilities for treating general medical, surgical, gynaecological and paediatric cases. In 1948 the radiology department was opened. The hospital building is included in the National Inventory of the Cultural Property of the Maltese Islands. University of Malta affiliation The Hospital served students attending Medical and Health Sciences courses within the University of Malta. The former medical school still houses the depository of pre-1965 monographs and all back runs of medical and nursing journals.

The Shenandoah had originally been in the Pacific Ocean when news reached her of the end of the Civil War, necessitating such a long voyage.The confederate surrender On her next assignment she carried Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Kellett and a replacement crew to relieve HMS Ocean, then on the China Station under Vice-Admiral Henry Keppel. She was then commanded by Captain William Hewett, seconded by John Fisher. In 1870 she became a tender to HMS Duke of Wellington, which was then a receiving ship in Portsmouth. Donegal was paid off on 30 September 1870. On 14 January 1886, Donegal was hulked and merged into the Torpedo School at Portsmouth, and her name was changed to Vernon. Between 1888 and 1892 she was commanded by Captain Arthur Knyvet Wilson. On 23 April 1895 she was moved to Portchester Creek, along with the rest of the hulks making up the school. She remained in this role until the torpedo school moved onshore in 1923, and Donegal was sold for scrapping on 18 May 1925 to Pounds, of Portsmouth.

Typical samples are similar in composition to plagioclase feldspar, and revert to that mineral when melted and recrystallized. It was named after British geologist M.H.N. Story-Maskelyne. Since maskelynite (like the volcanic glass obsidian) lacks an orderly arrangement of atoms, it is not considered a \\"mineral\\" by geologists, and is not listed as such by the Mineralogical Society of America. History The phase was first identified in the Shergotty meteorite by G. Tschermak (1872) as an isotropic glass of an unknown origin with near labradorite composition. Similar phases were found in chondrites and Martian meteorites. In 1963, D. J. Milton and P. S. de Carli produced a maskelynite-like glass by subjecting gabbro to an explosive shock wave. In 1967, T. E. Bunch and others identified maskelynite in the Clearwater West and Manicouagan craters. Origin At first, maskelynite was believed to result from solid-state transformation of plagioclase into diaplectic glass by a relatively low-pressure shock wave (250 to 300 kilobars) and low-temperature (350 ¬∞C), as in Milton and de Carli's experiment. Since 1997 this hypothesis has been challenged, and now it is believed that the glass is formed by the quenching of dense mineral melts produced by higher-pressure shock waves.

The ward includes Fishmongers' Hall, St. Magnus-the-Martyr church, the Monument to the Great Fire of London, and the full span of London Bridge. Bridge Within and Bridge Without The present day ward of Bridge was historically (1550-1978) known as Bridge Within ‚Äî a separate ward called Bridge Without existed south of the Thames in Southwark with its own Alderman between 1550 and 1978.Southwark#Relationship with the City of London In 1550 the new ward of Bridge Without was created to cover the City's area of control of three manors in Southwark (the newly acquired King's Manor and Great Liberty added to the Guildable Manor which it had controlled since 1327), the Court of Aldermen appointing its alderman; there were never any members of the Court of Common Council elected there as the three Courts Leet of the Manors fulfilled that representative role. The existing ward north of the river became Bridge Within. London Bridge viewed from Southwark: the Great Stone Gateway at the very southern end of the bridge formed the boundary between Within and Without. However, the City's administrative responsibility for the Without ward had in practice disappeared by the mid-Victorian era as various aspects of metropolitan government were extended into the neighbouring areas. St. Magnus-the-Martyr church. A 1720 map showing the wards of Bridge Within and neighbouring Billingsgate. Despite the fact that the area of Bridge Without had been removed completely from the City's boundaries in 1899, the ward continued to de jure exist and the Court of Aldermen continued to appoint an alderman for the ward by co-option, usually the senior emeritus Lord Mayor (or father of the City) until as late as 1978Barry One Off The Wards, or Aldermanries, in the Square Mile ‚Äî Bridge Without was then merged with Bridge Within, to become the present day Bridge ward. This is, in a sense, a return to the situation prior to 1550. However the ward is still officially referred to as \\"Bridge and Bridge Without\\" as a result of the 1978 amalgamation.Bridge Ward Club History of the Ward This had no practical effect in terms of representation on the Court of Common Council because Without had never had Councilmen. \\"Without\\" and \\"Within\\" denote whether a ward, or a division of one, fell outside or within the London Wall ‚Äî this is still the case for the wards of Farringdon Within and Farringdon Without ‚Äî though in this instance Bridge Without fell beyond the gates on London Bridge, rather than London Wall itself. The full span of London Bridge was for many centuries lined with buildings, including many houses, and they formed part of the ward of Bridge Within. Indeed, so numerous were the dwellings on the bridge that at one time it constituted three of the 14 precincts (a former sub-division of the wards) of Bridge Within.A Topographical Dictionary of England, Samuel Lewis, 1831, p 134 The area of the former Bridge Without ward today forms part of the London Borough of Southwark. Politics Bridge is one of 25 wards in the City of London, each electing an alderman to the Court of Aldermen and commoners (the City equivalent of a councillor) to the Court of Common Council of the City of London Corporation. Only electors who are Freemen of the City of London are eligible to stand. Bridge and Bridge Without currently elect two commoners to the Court of Common Council.

Background  Xue Yuanchao was born in 622. His family was from what would eventually become Pu Prefecture (Ëí≤Â∑û, roughly modern Yuncheng, Shanxi). His grandfather Xue Daoheng (ËñõÈÅìË°°) was a high-level official of Sui Dynasty before being executed in 609 due to jealousy that Emperor Yang of Sui had for his literary talent, and as a result, Xue Yuanchao's father Xue Shou (ËñõÊî∂) declined to serve under Sui Dynasty, and eventually joined the rebellion by the general Li Yuan in 617, serving under Li Yuan's son Li Shimin. After Li Yuan founded Tang Dynasty in 618 as its Emperor Gaozu, Xue Shou continued to serve Li Shimin as a secretary and advisor, but died fairly early in 624, still during Emperor Gaozu's reign at age 32. He was bestowed various honors in 633, after Li Shimin became emperor in 626 (as Emperor Taizong). Xue Yuanchao inherited the title Baron of Fenyin in 630, which Xue Shou had been created for his contributions in the campaign against Liu Heita. When he grew older, he became known for his studiousness and writing ability. Emperor Taizong was impressed by him, and had him marry Lady Hejing, the daughter of Emperor Taizong's brother Li Yuanji. He was made an attendant to Emperor Taizong's crown prince Li Zhi, and participated in drafting the official history of Jin Dynasty, the Book of Jin.  During Emperor Gaozong's reign  After Emperor Taizong died in 649, Li Zhi took the throne (as Emperor Gaozong). He made Xue Yuanchao an imperial attendant.According to the Old Book of Tang, Xue was 25 when this happened. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 73. However, based on his death year and age given in Xue's biographies in both the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang (which are used here), he would be 27 in 649, and when he was 25 in 647, Emperor Taizong was still emperor. See also New Book of Tang, vol. 98. He often submitted suggestions to Emperor Gaozong as to proper relations with his subject officials and the various current affairs, and Emperor Gaozong was impressed by them. He was soon made a mid-level official at the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) and an imperial scholar, continuing to be in charge of writing imperial histories. It was said that the legislative bureau had a large flat rock that Xue Yuanchao's grandfather Xue Daoheng had often used as a table on which to draft various regulations, and whenever Xue Yuanchao saw it, he would shed tears for his grandfather. In 654, on account of his mother's death, Xue Yuanchao left governmental service to observe a period of mourning. In 655, he returned to governmental service as Huangmen Shilang (ÈªÉÈñÄ‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the examination bureau of government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng), as well as a staff member for Emperor Gaozong's crown prince Li Zhong. By this point, Xue was known not only for his literary talent, but his ability to find capable people and recommend them for government service. Among the people he recommended were later key officials Ren Xigu (‰ªªÂ∏åÂè§), Gao Zhizhou, Guo Zhengyi, Wang Yifang (ÁéãÁæ©Êñπ), and Meng Lizhen (Â≠üÂà©Ë≤û). Later, though, he was sent out of the capital Chang'an to serve as the prefect of Rao Prefecture (È•íÂ∑û, roughly modern Shangrao, Jiangxi), on account of illness. In 658 or 663,Why there is this date ambiguity is because, in Xue's biography in the Old Book of Tang, it was only said that this happened \\"in the third year,\\" but did not specify which era. Based on the timeframe of the other events of Xue's career, both the third year of Xianqing (656-661) and the third year of Longshuo (661-663) would be possible. he became Dong Tai Shilang (Êù±Ëá∫‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the legislative bureau, which by this time was renamed Dong Tai (Êù±Ëá∫). In 663, the chancellor Li Yifu was removed from office and exiled to Xi Prefecture (Â∑ÇÂ∑û, roughly modern Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan), and according to regulations, exiles were not allowed to ride horses on the way to the place of exile. Xue made a request that Li be given a horse, and offended the emperor in doing so and was demoted to be the prefect of Jian Prefecture (Á∞°Â∑û, roughly modern Ziyang, Sichuan). In 664, another chancellor, Shangguan Yi, was executed for opposing Emperor Gaozong's powerful wife Empress Wu (later known as Wu Zetian), and as Xue often exchanged correspondences with Shangguan, Xue was himself removed from office and exiled to Xi Prefecture. Early in Emperor Gaozong's Shangyuan era (674-676), there was a general pardon, and Xue was allowed to return to Chang'an and was made an imperial advisor with the examination bureau. In 676, he became Zhongshu Shilang (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰æçÈÉé), the deputy head of the legislative bureau, which by this time had changed its name back to Zhongshu Sheng, and later that year he received the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Sanpin (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ã‰∏âÂìÅ), making him a chancellor de facto. Also that year, he was commissioned by Emperor Gaozong to go on a tour of the Hebei Circuit (Ê≤≥ÂåóÈÅì, roughly modern Hebei) to examine the prefects in the circuit. Around that time, there was an occasion when Emperor Gaozong was on a hunt when he had non-Han tribal chiefs attend the hunt, armed with weapons. Xue submitted a secret petition advising against it on the account of dangerousness, and Emperor Gaozong was touched by the concern he showed. From that point on, he often invited Xue to share meals with him and the imperial princes. Emperor Gaozong, impressed with Xue's talent in governance, also made the comment to him, \\"Given that you are at Zhongshu Sheng, I do not need a large number of people there.\\" In 680, when Emperor Gaozong's then-crown prince Li Xian was accused of treason, Emperor Gaozong put Xue, along with Pei Yan and Gao Zhizhou, in charge of the investigations, after which Li Xian was deposed and replaced with his brother Li Zhe. In 681, Xue was made Zhongshu Ling (‰∏≠Êõ∏‰ª§) ‚Äîthe head of the legislative bureau and a post considered one for a chancellor‚Äîas well as a member of Li Xi√°n's staff. In 682, when there was a major famine in the Guanzhong region (i.e., the Chang'an region), Emperor Gaozong left Chang'an to take up residence at the eastern capital Luoyang, and he left Li Zhe in charge of the capital, assisted by Xue and fellow chancellors Liu Rengui and Pei. Emperor Gaozong told Xue that Li Zhe was still young and needed counsel. Xue thereafter recommended a number of officials, including the later important officials Zheng Zuxuan (ÈÑ≠Á•ñÁéÑ), Deng Xuanting (ÈÑßÁéÑÊå∫), and Cui Rong (Â¥îËûç) to be resident scholars at Li Zhe's palace, and he often submitted advice to Li Zhe, counseling him against frequently spending time in hunting. Emperor Gaozong heard of this and awarded him with silk, and then summoned him to Luoyang. In 683, Xue suffered a throat illness that rendered him unable to speak, and he offered to retire. Emperor Gaozong allowed him to retire, and bestowed on him the honorific title Jinzi Guanglu Daifu (ÈáëÁ¥´ÂÖâÁ•øÂ§ßÂ§´). He died in winter 683‚Äîaround the same time that Emperor Gaozong himself died‚Äîand was buried with honors, near the tomb of Emperor Gaozong.

Playing career Rochford was born at New House, County Durham into a mining family, and as a youth he played for the Esh Winning junior XI. His family subsequently moved to Cuckfield, West Sussex from where he joined Portsmouth in July 1931. Portsmouth Rochford (known as \\"Rockie\\" throughout his career) made his debut for Portsmouth against Southampton in the Rowland Hospital Cup at The Dell in April 1932. At first, playing at right-back, he made only the occasional first team start for Pompey, who finished regularly in mid-table in the Football League First Division, but by 1934-35 he had become a regular choice and in 1936 he represented the English League. In 1937 he switched to left-back and stayed there, being an ever-present in 1937-38. His greatest moment for Portsmouth came in the FA Cup, when Pompey, who were struggling in the relegation zone, swept aside high-flying Wolves in the 1939 FA Cup Final running in 4-1 victors. As a result of the suspension of the FA Cup for the duration of World War II, the next FA Cup final was not until 7 years later in 1946, thereby enabling Portsmouth fans to claim that their team has held the Cup for the longest time. Rochford continued to play for Portsmouth during the war, making over 200 appearances in war-time matches. During the War he worked at the aircraft factory in Hamble-le-Rice and also played football for their works team Folland Aircraft. Southampton After the cessation of hostilities, he joined Southampton in July 1946 for a fee of ¬£550 in readiness for the first post-war league season. Rochford soon became automatic choice as team captain, and, according to Holley & Chalk's \\"In That Number\\" he \\"was a father figure to many of the younger and less experienced players\\", including Alf Ramsey and Bill Ellerington, who were vying for the right-back position. Over the next few seasons he rarely missed a game as Saints narrowly missed out on promotion from Division 2. In August 1949, he applied for the position as manager following the departure of Bill Dodgin to Fulham. Although Rochford was strongly tipped for the job, being the players' choice, his application was turned down in favour of Sid Cann. Although appointed player-coach under Cann, Rochford was disappointed and after missing out on promotion yet again at the end of the 1949-50 season, he left the club in July 1950 to join Colchester United. Colchester Colchester were about to embark on their first season in the Football League, but Rochford was only able to make two league appearances before retiring.

History  The territory of modern PƒÅvilosta has been inhabited since the Stone Age. During the late Iron Age and the Livonian crusade the territory was inhabited by Curonians and was part of the Piemare land. In 1253 in an agreement between Bishop of Courland and Livonian Order port at the mouth of Saka river is mentioned for the first time. In the later years small port named Sackenhausen was part of the Bishopric of Courland, Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and since 1795 Russian Empire. In 1879 local landlord from nearby Upesmui≈æa manor Otto Friedrich von Lilienfeld started extensive reconstruction works of the small port. The new port town was named Paulshafen, after baron's brother General governor of the Courland Governorate Paul von Lilienfeld. However, development of the town is not so fast as von Lilienfeld has planned. Many building plots are available for rent but during ten years only ten buildings are built. Port is used only by several fishermen and three small sailers owned by nearby manors. The real development of the town started in 1893 when the building of LiepƒÅja military port (Karosta) started. PƒÅvilosta became the main centre for transporting stones to the LiepƒÅja. Port was adjusted for stone shipment and many builders, workers and sailors came to the town. When stone shipment stopped town already had good port and shipping infrastructure. Until First World War there were three shipyards in the town where small one mast ships were built. However several bigger two-mast schooners for international voyages also were built in the town. Overall 15 ships were built in the PƒÅvilosta. In 1913 PƒÅvilosta received limited town rights. During the First World War PƒÅvilosta was occupied by the German Imperial army and saw heavy destruction. Almost all of the PƒÅvilosta fleet was destroyed, sold or confiscated. After the war, only two motorboats and four sailors were left in port. In the Republic of Latvia the port shifted its focus from merchant ships to fishery. In 1930 a fishermen cooperative was established in the town. In 1939 a Lutheran church was consecrated in the town. After the Occupation of Latvia in 1940 all fishermen were forced to unite in artel. During battles in the Courland Pocket several fishermen families fled from the second Soviet occupation with motorboats to Gotland, only 150 kilometres to the west. After the war, PƒÅvilosta became a port town in the Latvian SSR. Local fishermen artel used motor boats until 1949 when the first fishing ship was bought. In 1951 artel was transformed into fishermen kolkhoz Dzintarj≈´ra (Amber sea). In 1975 the kolkhoz was merged with LiepƒÅja fishermen kolkhoz Boƒº≈°eviks (The Bolshevik). In the 1970s there were around 20 fishing trawlers in PƒÅvilosta port. After 1991 PƒÅvilosta again became part of the Republic of Latvia. It was granted town rights in 1991. In 1994 stock company PƒÅvilosta was established who today owns two fishing trawlers. Today port is used mainly by local fishermen boats and tourist yachts. There is also sailing, surfing and windsurfing school in the town who owns several yachts.

It went direct-to-video and was first aired on Sci-Fi Channel in the USA. Plot After becoming stranded in a small town called Hope, Elizabeth \\"Liz\\" Chambers, (Jaimie Alexander) discovers her arrival was foretold a century earlier by the town's founding preacher Jonas Hathaway (Nick Chinlund) and that she is an integral part of his impending‚Äîand terrifying‚Äîrebirth. Forced to stay overnight in the town, Liz meets Sarah Austin (Hudson Leick), a reporter for a tabloid newspaper, who is in town to investigate legends of living scarecrows. The townspeople of Hope once sacrificed people by nailing them to crosses in the cornfields until a young girl alerted residents of the nearby town of Liberty. Horrified to learn of the murders going on in Hope, the townspeople of Liberty nailed the local preacher who spearheaded the sacrifices to a cross. Legend contends that one day he will be reborn. Sarah persuades Liz to accompany her to the cornfield. At the cornfield, Sarah takes photos of a scarecrow that she and Liz construct and hang on a cross, intending to use the photograph for the newspaper's front page. Sarah is later attacked and killed by the scarecrow, which comes to life. The scarecrow tries to kill Liz as well but she manages to escape in the squad car of a deputy, who is killed upon arriving at the scene. She drives to the sheriff's office, where she tells her tale. When the deputy is unable to reach anyone by radio or phone, he leaves Liz alone while he goes to find out the problem. Liz is able to fend off the scarecrow when it arrives, stalking her. She tries to flee in her car but sees that the engine has been removed. She takes refuge with the town's preacher (Ethan Phillips), but discovers that the preacher is the leader of the townspeople, who worship the spirit of the founding preacher. The preacher intends to bring the spirit back to life by fathering a child with Liz, whom the spirit can possess. The sheriff arrives in time to stop the townspeople, but loses consciousness in a car crash. When the clergyman tries to rape Liz, she fends him off and escapes. As she flees, she finds Sabrina (Chlo√´ Grace Moretz), a child hiding in an underground shelter. Her parents were killed by the scarecrow, but she had escaped. Meanwhile, the townspeople set out in search of Liz. Liz hides Sabrina in a hole in the cornfield while she goes for help. She makes it to the next town only to find everyone dead. She is picked up by the sheriff, who escaped, and Liz tells him about Sabrina and jokes that the townspeople think she is a virgin. When they return to the cornfield, Liz discovers that the sheriff has been possessed by the spirit of the evil preacher. The preacher now goes in search of Sabrina as Liz is not pure. Sabrina sneaks into the farmhouse and sets it on fire. The townspeople let Liz and Sabrina escape while they burn the body of the preacher, as the prophecy tells them to. Liz flees with the child, but the spirit of the preacher possesses the body of Sabrina's father, who they encounter hanging on one of the crosses in the cornfield. Vines ensnare Liz as the animated corpse appeals to Sabrina. A murder of crows appear and the townspeople believe it is a good omen, until the crows attack and kill them, as well as attacking Sabrina's father, allowing Liz to extract herself from the vines. Liz and Sabrina escape, hitching a ride from a truck driver who is passing through the area. He turns on the radio, and a song comes on that reminds Liz and Sabrina of their ordeal. Liz turns the radio off, and they continue down the road, leaving Hope behind.

In 1977, aged 15, she was killed by a letterbomb addressed to her father. In the presence of her brother Kevin (then 10 years old), she opened the package, which she thought to be a present since it was covered in wrapping paper. The bomb exploded, and she died half an hour later at St. Luke's Hospital, due to severe burns on various parts of her body. At her funeral Mass, Archbishop Mikiel Gonzi called the murder of Karin Grech \\"the first terrorist act in the country\\".\\"The bomber who killed Karin Grech was a loner\\", timesofmalta.com; 30 December 2011; accessed 16 July 2015. 1977 doctors' strike At that time the doctors at Saint Luke's Hospital had an issue with the Labour Government and there was a strike at the Hospital. Despite this Grech still went to work, and although there is no forensic evidence linking the bomb to the doctors' strike, the strike and persons related to those events were blamed. On the same day that the Grech family received the bomb, another bomb was sent to the doctor and then-Labour MP Paul Chetcuti Caruana, but it did not detonate. Investigation The case remains unsolved, the perpetrators unknown, and the Magisterial Inquiry is still open. Since 2008, the Police have been interrogating people who had not been questioned by police in previous investigations. In 2009, the newspaper It- Torƒãa reported that the police are suspecting a small number of Maltese doctors who reside in England, who were known to have close ties with the Nationalist Party at the time of the 1977 doctors' strike. The same newspaper reported that articles which appeared in the British Medical Journal in 1977 are also being investigated. Compensation In late November 2010, the Civil Court ordered the Prime Minister to give a sum of ‚Ç¨419,287 to Professor Grech and his family as compensation for Karin's murder. Grech said that this opens many doors in his investigation to help the police to find out the killer or killers. At the same time, he showed disappointment at the way the police have investigated the murder of his daughter. Judge Raymond Pace, who chaired the proceedings, said that the failure of the Government to compensate the family for all these years is a discriminatory treatment based on policy. The judge made it clear that the crime happened as a consequence of the services that Professor Grech offered to the Maltese Government, and that the Government, in deciding to refuse compensation, was acting in a discriminatory manner. Judge Pace argued that the evidence shows that the government compensated several people who ended up as victims due to their service to the Government, or who have suffered from violent acts, but failed to do the same with the Grech family. A few days later the Government announced that it would appeal the judgement. Although it said it would pay the compensation, the Government said that it did not agree with the Court that this was a political case, as the crime remains unsolved. On 11 April 2011, the Constitutional Court dismissed the appeal brought by the Government and upheld the judgements of the Civil Court. The government accepted the ruling and paid the compensation. Legacy After Karin's murder, some postal items were checked for bombs between 1978 and 2001. The ones which were marked as safe were marked with a cross and the name of the place where it was applied.

He served as the head football coach Marshall University for nine seasons, from 1996 to 2004. During his tenure at Marshall, the Marshall Thundering Herd football team compiled a record of 94‚Äì23 (.803 winning percentage), completed two undefeated seasons, won six conference championships, won five of seven bowl games played, and captured the NCAA Division I-AA Football Championship in 1996. Pruett has coached many high- profile National Football League players, including Randy Moss, Chad Pennington, and Byron Leftwich. In 1999, he was inducted into the Marshall University Athletics Hall of Fame for his collegiate career in football, track and field, and wrestling. Early life and playing career Pruett is a native of Beckley, West Virginia and was a star football player, wrestler, and sprinter at Woodrow Wilson High School. He attended Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia where he originally played halfback on the football team, but moved to tight end his last two years, catching 24 passes for 442 yards and four touchdowns. After graduation in 1965 he signed as a free agent with the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League, and later played for five seasons with a semi-pro team in Virginia. High school coaching career Pruetts' coaching career began with the school system of Fairfax County, Virginia in the Washington, D.C. suburbs. He was an assistant football coach, head wrestling coach and head golf coach at Falls Church High School (1965‚Äì1967) and Hayfield Secondary School (1968‚Äì1969). His first head coaching job was at Groveton High School from 1970 to 1972. He was portrayed in the movie Remember the Titans when the 1971 Groveton vs TC Williams game was featured. Pruett then moved to Gar-Field Senior High School in Woodbridge, Virginia, serving as head football coach from 1973 to 1978.http://www.virginiasports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/021109aaa.html Collegiate coaching career Pruett earned his first collegiate coaching job in 1979 as the defensive line coach for his alma mater, Marshall University. In 1981, he became the defensive backs coach and defensive coordinator for the Herd until the end of the 1982 season. Before the start of the 1983 season, Pruett joined the coaching staff of the Wake Forest Demon Deacons as the defensive backs coach. His lifelong friend, Al Groh, was the head coach of the Demon Deacons at the time. He remained the defensive backs coach until 1985, when he took on the role of defensive coordinator. Though Groh stepped down as head coach of the Deacons in 1986, Pruett kept the job of DC until 1990, when he became the defensive backs coach at Ole Miss the next season. Pruett, known for his diverse defensive coverages, gained high respect in the NCAA, and as a result, would coach as a defensive coordinator or head coach for the rest of his coaching career. The following year, the Tulane Green Wave hired him as their defensive coordinator until the end of the 1993 season, when one of his lifelong goals came true. Pruett, who had aspired to coach at the University of Florida for quite some time, applied and was employed by Steve Spurrier‚Äôs staff for the 1994 and 1995 seasons as defensive coordinator. In his first season there, his defense held opposing teams to an average of 84.6 rushing yards per game, and kept those same teams to an average of 17.1 points per game. That season, the Gators played the University of Alabama Crimson Tide in the SEC Championship, in which they won, 24-23. They then accepted a bid to play in the Sugar Bowl against their in-state rivals, the Florida State Seminoles, in which they lost, 17-23. In his second and final season at Florida, Pruett's defensive squad led the team to an undefeated regular season. Also, the UF defense that year was ranked top 25 in the nation in scoring defense, pass efficiency defense, rushing defense, and total defense. In the SEC Championship that year, the Gators took on the Arkansas Razorbacks and came out with an easy win, with the score 34-3. At #2 in the AP Polls, The Gators were given a bid to play in the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Arizona against the also undefeated Nebraska Cornhuskers. The game was a rout, with the Cornhuskers coming away with the victory, 62-24. This game came to be known as the \\"Fiasco Bowl\\" due to the lopsided score. While coaching at Florida, the head coaching job at Marshall University became vacant due to Jim Donnan taking the head coaching job at the University of Georgia. Pruett immediately applied for the position, later Marshall President J. Wade Gilley called Pruett and informed him that the job was his. In 2008, Pruett came out of retirement to become the defensive coordinator for Virginia. After the 2008 season, Pruett retired again.

He finished his studies in the Capital Region's Technical Institute, obtaining the title of Technical Superior in Mechanics with a technology minor.  Business Dur√°n's first big business deal was the sale of Sony equipment and microwaves to the Pepeganga chain, using a loan of $1,000,000 from the Latino Bank, thanks to an endorsement from Omar Camero. Then in 1992, Camero and Dur√°n worked as partners in a business called Dislaca, dedicated to food imports, distributing to Procter & Gamble. In 1993 Duran bought his first aircraft, a Cessna 206. In 1997 Duran made a successful and lucrative high-risk investment in Tyco, making $275,000 from a $20,000 investment.

Necromance released two albums in the 1990s: White Gothic (1997) and Wiederkehr der Schmerzen (1999). Their 2001 album Tribulation Force showcased a strong industrial metal influence. The band has toured Europe, and performed on notable European festivals such as Freakstock in Germany. Their two latest albums were well received by magazines such as Rock Hard and Metal Heart. The band leader Runhardt Scheffler typically writes lyrics about the End Times. (German) Biography The band was formed under the name Secret Attack in 1987 and played death metal. In 1989 they changed the name to Necromance, and toured Europe in the early 1990s with Demigod and Lubricant. After recruiting a keyboard player to its line up, the band began playing gothic metal in 1992. Necromance released a split-cd with Enslaved (Ger) in 1991 and the demos Slow Death (1991), The Dwarf (1992), split-cd Zander 1993, and a demo called The Parable of the Weed (1994). In 1993 at one concert, a group of right-wing extremists attacked the band and murdered the band's driver, Mike Zerna. During 1994 two members left Necromance, and the band became Christian. Their line up was: Sandra (vocals, guitar), Ren√© (synthesizer), Mike (guitar) Runhardt (vocals, guitar). Necromance recorded their first album White Gothic in 1997. After the release, they signed a record deal with Pleitegeier Records. In 1999, they released Wiederkehr der Schmerzen on this label. The album incorporated more industrial elements. Later in 2001, these elements became more apparent on their sound when they recorded the album Tribulation Force. For the recording line up, the band was joined by Raphaela Polterman for vocals, and Jean Schulze returned as a drummer. The album was produced by Mozart and Lutz Demmler of the German gothic and industrial metal band Umbra et Imago. The album's production was more expensive than on their previous works, and according to the band, Tribulation Force did not receive any marketing from the label. As a result, Necromance sold all their instruments to cover the costs and disbanded in April 2002. Since then the band has not released new material. Their website has gone offline but few years ago the band gave their first two albums as free downloads on their site. However, on December 23, 2007 the band launched an official MySpace page. Music Necromance's music is said to have strong romantic old school gothic influences that pushes back into the early style of bands such as Bauhaus, London After Midnight and Fields of the Nephilim while also experimenting with abstract, almost industrial sounds implemented in many of their songs. Some of Necromance's songs have elements of their old German death metal roots, notably the rough vocals. Some songs are sung in German, with the majority in English. Necromance's music is guitar driven, and the songs are characterized by minimalistic structures, danceable drums, melancholic atmosphere, and symphonic keyboards. Necromance shares vocal duties between male and female vocalists. Runhardt's vocals are deep, aggressive and raspy. Their lyrics are described as sometimes almost worshipful and typically talk about the End Times based on the Book of Revelation.Admin the Administrator (September 5, 2005). . Balaam's Miracle.

The Millennium Bridge crosses into the City at Queenhithe. Queenhithe is also the name of the ancient, but now disused, dock and a minor street, which runs along that dock, both of which are within the ward. The ward is served by London Buses route 4, which runs along Queen Victoria Street and stops by the Millennium footbridge,TfL Buses from Mansion House and St Paul's and the nearest London Underground station is Mansion House, on Queen Victoria Street. History The ward's name derives from the \\"Queen's Dock\\",The City of London - A History, Borer, M I C: New York, D.McKay Co, 1978 or \\"Queen's Quay\\", which was probably a Roman dock (or small harbour), but known in Saxon times as \\"Ae√∞ereshy√∞\\", later \\"Ethelred's Hythe\\". The dock existed during the period when the Wessex king, Alfred the Great, re-established the City of London, circa 886 AD. It only became \\"Queenhithe\\" (spelt archaically as \\"Queenhythe\\") when Matilda, wife of King Henry I, was granted duties on goods landed there. The Queenhithe dock remains today, but has long fallen out of use and is heavily silted up (being tidal). Queenhithe harbour was used for importing corn into London and continued to be in use into the 20th century, by the fur and tanning trades. Being upstream of London Bridge, however, meant that large sea-going sailing ships could no longer safely reach the dock from the sea. King Charles II landed at Queenhithe during the Great Fire of London in September 1666 to view the extent of the destruction and assist in the firefighting. The dock, including the wharf walls and adjacent street, was designated a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1973; it is the only surviving inlet on the modern City's waterfront. Its walls have been re-strengthened, as part of London's flood defences. Bombing in the Blitz destroyed approximately three-quarters of the ward's buildings: the only listed buildings are St Benet Paul's Wharf Church, and the tower of the former St Mary Somerset Church. A key sequence of the 1951 comedy The Lavender Hill Mob used Queenhithe as a location for filming: Mr. Holland, played by Alec Guinness, can be seen falling from a wharf into the Thames and being rescued by two actors dressed as police officers. Construction of the Millennium Bridge began in 1998 before its opening in 2000. The construction of this footbridge, which created a direct pedestrian route from Bankside (at the Tate Modern) to the St Paul's area, has contributed to a dramatic increase in tourists and commuters transitting the ward of Queenhithe. Notable sites The Salvation Army's headquarters in Queenhithe. Queenhithe includes a number of notable buildings and sites, including: *The Aviation Environment Federation's headquarters, at No. 2, Broken Wharf; *The City of London School, at No. 107, Queen Victoria Street; *The Salvation Army's international headquarters, at No. 101, Queen Victoria Street, on the corner of Peter's Hill; and *The Painter Stainers' Hall, at No. 9, Little Trinity Lane. *The Queenhithe Mosaic, at 1 Queenhithe. Also within the ward are the London offices of the international law firm Salans and the Japanese bank Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.www.tufts.edu Peter's Hill, which since the construction of the Millennium footbridge is a major pedestrian route, shown leading up to St. Paul's Cathedral. The ward has a complex urban topography, largely due to post-World War II development, with Upper Thames Street running beneath Peter's Hill and a number of large post- War buildings, such as Millennium Bridge House and Queensbridge House. A number of old lanes and alleys remain, some of which cross the thoroughfare by footbridge. The Welsh church of St Benet Paul's Wharf, on Bennet's Hill, is in the northwest corner of the ward. Two former churches were situated within the ward, very near to one another: St Michael Queenhithe and St Mary Somerset, of which only the tower of St Mary's remains. The Queenhithe Mosaic is a 30-metre-long timeline on the wall of Queenhithe Dock. The mosaic was completed in 2014 and features key figures from history who built and used the dock and lived nearby. Queenhithe is one of the smaller residential centres in the otherwise business-dominated City; with a population of 319 as of 2011, it mostly comprises the residents of the three riverside residential developments: Sir John Lyon House, Globe View and Queen's Quay. A small number of bars and restaurants have been established along the riverside, with views across to the Globe theatre and Tate Modern. Boundary In 2003 the ward boundaries of the City of London were altered quite considerably, including those of Queenhithe, in what was the first comprehensive review of local government boundaries. Queenhithe lost some ground to the north and east to Vintry, but gained (including the City of London School) to the west from Castle Baynard. A further review of ward boundaries, effective in 2013, recommended no further changes to Queenhithe's boundaries. The ward is recognised as one of the four residential wards of the City (with a population of 319 (2011), the smallest of those wards)www.statistics.gov.uk and policy is to retain a predominantly residential vote (as opposed to the business vote being predominant) in these wards.City of London Corporation Ward Boundary Review The present-day boundary of the ward, starting from the Thames in the west, runs north along White Lion Hill (to the west of the City School) then east along Queen Victoria Street then down Lambeth Hill. The boundary then runs for a short distance along Upper Thames Street before heading north up Huggin Hill to include Painters' Hall, after which the boundary turns south towards the river again; the ward includes all of Queensbridge House. Leading to the river, the boundary crosses Upper Thames Street and then runs along Queenhithe (the street), including the whole of the old Queenhithe dock. Included within the ward boundary is the part of the Thames, adjacent to the Queenhithe shore, which is in the City (i.e. to a line midway across the width of the river). Indeed, approximately half of the ward's area is the River Thames and shore; with this part excluded the ward is the smallest (by area) in the City. The ward (and City) boundary is crossed halfway over the Millennium Bridge. The ward is bounded by the wards of Castle Baynard to the west, Bread Street to the north, Vintry to the east, and the London Borough of Southwark to the south (across the river). Prior to the 2003 changes it also bounded Cordwainer ward. Politics Queenhithe is one of 25 wards in the City of London, each electing an alderman to the Court of Aldermen, and commoners (the City equivalent of a Councillor) to the Court of Common Council of the City of London Corporation. Only Freemen of the City of London are eligible to stand for election. Queenhithe returns an Alderman and two Common Councilmen to the Corporation of London.Alderman Gordon Haines Queenhythe, Jamaica A rural community called Queenhythe (or Queen Hythe) exists in the Saint Ann parish of Jamaica.

After a long period of obscurity, his work has been increasingly recognised from the early 20th century onwards. Biography Towne was born in Isleworth in Middlesex,Stephens; Towne's baptism in Isleworth is now firmly established, in a 1996 article in the Burlington Magazine (vol 138, pp.500-5). The records of the Painter Stainers Company, where Towne enrolled as an apprentice, also state that Towne's father was from Isleworth. Before this, some sources assumed that Towne was from Devon, as he lived and worked there for so long. the son of a corn chandler. In 1752 he was apprenticed to a leading coach painter in London, Thomas Brookshead. In 1759 he won a design prize from the Society of Arts, and studied for a while at St Martin‚Äôs Lane Academy; according to his pupil John White Abbott many years later, around this time he also studied under the court portraitist John Shackleton. In 1763 Towne was employed by a coach painter called Thomas Watson in Long Acre, and went to Exeter on business, where he soon settled. He had already begun painting in oils and also taught drawing, and now he began to accept commissions from wealthy families in Devon. After a tour of north Wales in 1777, undertaken with his friend, the Exeter lawyer James White (1744‚Äì1825), he began to specialize in watercolours. In 1780 he travelled to Rome, where he knew, and painted with, John \\"Warwick\\" Smith, who had been there since 1776, and William Pars, a friend from London. He spent a month in Naples in March 1781, staying with Thomas Jones. After returning to Rome, and excursions to Tivoli and other nearby areas, he travelled home to England with Smith, passing over the Alps. His works from this trip include over 200 sheets, and 54 large views of Rome which emphasize the ancient ruins rather than the post-classical sights or the contemporary life of the city. These 54 were later exhibited as a group in 1805 but never sold; he painted copies of them instead when he got commissions. Many were reworked later, starting around 1800, in the heavier and more conventional style he had by then adopted. At his death Towne left the group to the British Museum, where they remain.Stephens On his return to Devon, he was asked by Sir Thomas and Lady Acland of Killerton to paint some views in Devon and North Wales, and in 1786 he went on a painting tour of the Lake District. He painted versions of his watercolours, of Rome and elsewhere, in oils, mainly to submit to the Royal Academy, but though several were exhibited his eleven attempts from 1788 on to be elected a member all failed, and he gave up in 1803. He remained in Exeter painting and teaching, achieving reasonable success. In the last years of his life he returned to live in London.Stephens He married Jeannette Hilligsberg, a French dancing mistress aged 27, on the 5th of August 1807, but she died in April 1808.Wilcox, 2006, \\"Francis Towne\\" He remained an obscure figure until the early 20th century,Stephens so that the collector Paul Opp√© was able to acquire numbers of important works very cheaply. Opp√© was greatly impressed, especially with Towne's elegant and somewhat stylised early manner, which chimed with trends in English painting at the time,Stephens \\"the taste of our own century for flat colourful pattern- making\\", as Andrew Wilton put it in 1993.Wilton & Lyles, 38 After making contact with descendants of Towne's student and friend, John Herman Merivale, Opp√© discovered a collection of largely unseen works which Towne had bequeathed to Merivale. He catalogued the works and published an article about the artist in a 1919 volume of the Walpole Society journal. These writings helped to create a revival of interest in Towne, and more works began to appear on the market. By the 1950s he was widely recognised as an important figure and his works were owned by many museums, especially the British Museum and the Yale Center for British Art.Stephens A catalogue raisonn√© of the artist's work is published by the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art.A Catalogue Raisonn√© of Francis Towne (1739-1816), now available, paul- mellon-centre.ac.uk 19 May 2016. Retrieved 28 May 2016. Archived here. From January 2016, the British Museum held an exhibition of the watercolours he painted in Rome, and art critic Jonathan Jones commented: :Francis Towne, who failed 11 times to get elected to the Royal Academy but had the foresight to leave these watercolours to the British Museum when he died in 1816, may not be a famous British artist. He is, however, as this entrancing exhibition reveals, a great one.

This object is an inactive F-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of F9.5V; in between F8 and G0. This indicates it is generating energy through core hydrogen fusion. The star is similar to the Sun, but is slightly hotter and more massive. It is about 5.1 billion years old and it is spinning slowly with a projected rotational velocity of 1.3 km/s. The metallicity of this star is below solar, meaning the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium is lower than in the Sun. The star HD 23079 is named Tupi. The name was selected in the NameExoWorlds campaigns by Brazil during the 100th anniversary of the IAU. The star is named after the Tupi people, a indigenous group.

KKCK debuted automated with TM Programming's \\"Stereo Rock\\" Top 40 format briefly, then converted to fully local programming in the mid-1980s. After the call letter change to KKCK in 1982, the station changed its slogan to \\"KK100,\\" also known as \\"Double K 100.\\" In 1988, it adopted \\"FM 100 KKCK\\" as its slogan after upgrading from 3,000 watts at 100.1 FM to 100,000 watts at 99.7 FM. The station repositioned as \\"99-7 KKCK\\" with the \\"Always A Better Music Mix\\" slogan in 1992. The station had significant listenership in the Sioux Falls, South Dakota market during the 1990s, despite its transmitter tower being located over 50 miles away, as it was the de facto Top 40/CHR for Sioux Falls until KKLS-FM flipped to \\"Hot 104.7\\" in 1997.

Unlike most Top 40/CHR formatted stations, KKCK had flexibility to introduce new music to listeners (including, but not limited to, Top 40 (CHR), Rhythmic, Dance Radio/EDM, and Mainstream Urban) as well as included genres such as indie, alternative, modern rock/active rock, and Hot AC/Modern AC including those genres' new music in its music mix. The station also aired The Shag, a long running alternative rock program, on Sunday nights. It shares a local news department with KMHL, and gets national news from ABC.

The gate houses the National Association of Garibaldi Veterans and Survivors along with the Garibaldi Museum (also dedicated to the Italian Partisan Division \\"Garibaldi\\", operating between 1943 and 1945). Porta San Pancrazio, outer side  History  The gate rises close to the summit of the Janiculum hill and its first building could date back to the end of the Roman Republic, when a humble housing cluster on the right bank of the Tiber was surrounded by a little urban wall. It later marked the southern vertex of the stretch of the wall, built in 270 by Emperor Aurelian, that climbed the hill with a triangle-shaped layout. One of the relevant characteristics of the 14th Region, where the gate rose, was that Via Aurelia vetus passed through it: the street started from Pons Aemilius, climbed the hill and exited from the town just through the gate, that took its name from the street (even now, the present Via Aurelia Antica, having lost its stretch within Trastevere, starts here). For this reason, the former name of the gate was Porta Aurelia,There was also another ‚ÄúPorta Aurelia‚Äù (also called ‚ÄúCornelia‚Äù), that often caused confusion in the ancient documents: it rose close to the Mausoleum of Hadrian and gave access to Via Aurelia Nova (which up ahead joined together with the other street). The ambiguity was later removed, as the first gate was dedicated to ‚ÄúSan Pancrazio‚Äù and the second one to ‚ÄúSan Pietro‚Äù, due to its proximity to St. Peter's Basilica. though the denominations Gianicolense or Aureliana - from the name of the consul that conceived and built the road - are attested. The importance of the near sepulchre of the Christian martyr Pancras, of the catacomb consecrated to him and later of the Basilica, destinations of continual pilgrimages, became so much prevalent along the consular street, as to influence - just like in many other cases - the process of Christianization of the nomenclature of the Roman gates, and since the 6th century the gate was bestowed the name it maintains to this day.Procopius of Caesarea, De bello gothico 1,18,35; 19,4; 23,1; 28,19. In the vicinity, on the inner side, there were the public mills, placed close to the merge of the aqueduct called Aqua Traiana, which operated until the end of the Middle Ages. The original aspect of the gate is absolutely unknown and probably it also rose in a slightly different position. Some clues dating back to 16th and 17th century might lead to suppose that it had a single arch with two quadrangular towers on its sides, thus confirming the typical structure of all the restorations carried up by Emperor Honorius at the beginning of the 5th century. On February 537, the gate gave in to the siege of the Goths led by Vitiges. Porta San Pancrazio in the 18th century(etching by Giuseppe Vasi) The whole gate was partially rebuilt in the 17th century by Mattia de Rossi, a disciple of Gian Lorenzo Bernini, during the construction of the new urban wall called Mura Gianicolensi (Janiculum walls), by orders of Pope Urban VIII. De' Rossi simply removed the gate, but maintained the Aurelian counter-gate. The new walls replaced, by demolishing it, the whole stretch of Aurelian walls rising on the right side of the Tiber, as well as Porta Portuensis and Porta San Pancrazio, that were completely re- built (the first one became the present Porta Portese, about 400 m further north than the former position), with the baroque architectural style typical of that age. The gate became later famous for the combats that took place in the area, in the period April - June 1849, between the military units of the Roman Republic, captained by Giuseppe Garibaldi, and the French troops intervened to protect the Papacy. On that occasion the gate was destroyed by French bombings. It was rebuilt to its present aspect by the architect Virginio VespignaniVespignani also rebuilt Porta Salaria, on the basis of a quite similar design, before its ultimate demolition. in 1854, on commission by Pope Pius IX, and had once again a prominent role on September 20, 1870, when it was passed through by the troops of General Nino Bixio, at the same time of the one entering Porta Pia. On the occasion of the 19th-century rehash, the following inscription was placed on the attic: ::; PORTAM PRAESIDIO URBIS IN IANICULO VERTICE ::; AB URBANO VIII PONT. MAX. EXTRUCTAM COMMUNITAM ::; BELLI IMPETU AN. CHRIST. MDCCCLIV DISIECTAM ::; PIUS IX PONT.

Torquato treasury prefect.) In effect the structure housed both the rooms of the military garrison (the taberna) and the office for the collection of the passage toll (vectigalibus exigendis). With regards to this, it is worth mentioning that since the 5th and at least until the 15th century, the wall gates and the collection of the toll were farmed out or sold to private citizens as a normal practice. A document dated 1467The document is held in the Archivio Vaticano and is quoted as Document XXXVII by S. Malatesta in Statuti delle gabelle di Roma, Rome, 1886. reports an announcement that specifies the modalities for the auction sale of the city gates for a one-year term. Another document, dated 1474,Customs register of the year 1474. states that the tender price of Porta San Pancrazio was ‚Äùflorins 25, bol. XXI per sextaria‚Äù (‚Äúsemestral instalment‚Äù); it is a quite moderate price, therefore the urban traffic through that gate should be moderate too. Two tenders concerning Porta San Pancrazio during the 15th century are documented, as well as another one, granted in 1566 by Pope Pius V to his nephew Lorenzo Giberti. The toll was usually disciplined by precise tables, concerning the charge for whichever kind of goods,See Document XXXVI quoted by S. Malatesta, op. cit. but it was continually rounded off by different kinds of infringements, as proved by several edicts against this custom.

The station airs a full service news/talk format and is owned by James Ingstad. KNUJ also has a sister station, KNUJ-FM. History KNUJ went on the air May 22, 1949 by Mickelson Media, owner of the New Ulm Journal. Mickelson Media owned the station for over 36 years. In the early 1970s, KNUJ-FM was established on 93.1 FM. That station would become KXLP in 1982. On March 6, 1986, KNUJ and KXLP were the first two stations purchased by upstart owner James Ingstad, a member of a family that owned radio stations in North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa and other areas. A few years later, KXLP's studios were moved to Mankato. A new KNUJ-FM signed on in June 1995, as \\"BRaT 107.3.\\" The 4000-watt station licensed to nearby Sleepy Eye played adult contemporary music. Both stations simulcast from 6 to 8:30 am, Monday through Friday, and shorter hours on Saturday. A month later, KNSG in Springfield, Minnesota signed on the air. On August 14, 1998, Cumulus Broadcasting purchased many stations from Ingstad. Two years later, Cumulus turned around and sold some of the stations, including KNUJ and KNUJ-FM to Clear Channel. The sale became effective on October 2, 2000. Ingstad obtained the three stations again from Clear Channel in February 2003, as part of a trade for a station in Bismarck, North Dakota. KNSG was spun off to Linder Radio. KNUJ-FM changed its format to adult hits in June 2005, picking up a satellite-fed syndicated format from Westwood One, and becoming \\"SAM 107.3.\\" Programming KNUJ is mostly a locally oriented news/talk/sports and farm station. In addition, the station airs an hour long polka music weekdays and on Sunday afternoons. The station also plays country music whenever they aren't carrying other types of programming.

It was associated with Bitch≈´ Province in modern-day Okayama Prefecture.\\"Bitch≈´ Province\\" at JapaneseCastleExplorer.com; retrieved 2013-4-27. History The Niwase domain was founded in 1600, when Togawa Michiyasu, a retainer of Ukita Hideie, rebelled against his lord and sided with the Tokugawa clan at the Battle of Sekigahara. As a reward, the Tokugawa granted Togawa a 29,000 koku fief centered at Niwase Castle. Between the 2nd and fourth generations, parts of the territory were handed out to Michiyasu's various brothers, leaving Niwase with 20,000 koku by the tenure of the 4th generation lord, Yasukaze. Yasukaze died without an heir, and the Togawa family came to an end, with the domain confiscated by the shogunate. In 1683, the Kuze family was transferred to Niwase from Sekiyado, its landholdings were 50,000 koku. The Kuze were there for only one generation, under Kuze Shigeyuki, before being transferred to the Tanba-Kameyama Domain. Matsudaira Nobumichi became the next lord of Niwase, with a 30,000 koku territory; however, he too was transferred, after only 4 years, to the Kaminoyama Domain in Dewa Province. In 1699, Itakura Shigetaka was transferred into Niwase, with a landholding of 20,000 koku. The domain remained under Itakura rule from then until the Meiji Restoration. The domain school, the Sei'ikan (Ë™†ÊÑèÈ§®), was founded in 1818. With the end of the han system in 1871, the domain was disbanded, and eventually incorporated into Okayama Prefecture, within which its territory remains to the present day. The Itakura family became viscounts (shishaku Â≠êÁàµ) in the new kazoku nobility system. One notable native of the Niwase Domain was the assassinated prime minister Inukai Tsuyoshi.

He served for almost two decades as a teacher in the schools that his order managed until being caught up in the turmoil of the Spanish Civil War that saw the forces of the Second Spanish Republic execute him. His beatification was celebrated on 29 April 1990 after it was confirmed that Barbal was killed \\"in odium fidei\\" (\\"in hatred of the faith\\") and the confirmation of a miracle attributed to his intercession allowed for Pope John Paul II to canonize him as a saint of the Roman Catholic Church on 21 November 1999. Life Manuel Barbal i Cos√≠n was born in Lleida. He began his ecclesiastical studies at a religious school where seminarians were educated in 1911 for the Diocese of Urgel. But he soon developed hearing problems and was forced to withdraw from the institute and could not pursue a path to the priesthood as he had intended. In 1917 he entered the novitiate of the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools in Irun where he was given the religious name of \\"Jaime Hilario\\" and the habit on 24 February. Until 1933 he was sent on various teaching assignments and was regarded as an exceptional teacher and catechist; he taught Latin and was a believer in universal education with an emphasis on the poor. His hearing problems continued to persist and worsen and, at the beginning of the 1930s, he was forced to stop teaching and began work as a gardener at the college of Saint Joseph in Tarragona. The outbreak of the civil war in mid-1936 while traveling to visit his relations saw him arrested for being a member of a religious congregation. In December 1936, he was transferred to the prison ship \\"Mahon\\" at Tarragona. Although he could have claimed that he was a gardener, he insisted that he was a religious brother and, on 15 January 1937, he was tried and convicted for being a member of the De La Salle Brothers. In his trial, his defense advocate told him to cite his occupation as a gardener, but he refused to do so and said he would claim to be a religious brother, as was the case. Barbal was taken to Monte de los Olivos ‚Äì an olive grove ‚Äì in Tarragona for execution during the afternoon of 18 January 1937. When the first two salvos from the firing squad failed to harm Barbal, the firing squad commander shot him five times at close range. His last words were: \\"To die for Christ, my young friends, is to live\\". He was the first of 97 of his order killed in Catalonia during the Spanish Civil War. Sainthood The beatification process started in Tarragona in 1944 and concluded a short time later in 1945 while the Congregation for the Causes of Saints later validated this process several decades later on 7 June 1985 in Rome; the postulation sent the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in 1988 for assessment. Theological experts first approved on 24 February 1989 that he was killed \\"in odium fidei\\" (\\"in hatred of the faith\\") while the C.C.S. conceded the same thing in their meeting on 17 October 1989. Pope John Paul II confirmed on 21 December 1989 that Barbal was killed in hatred of his faith and then beatified Barbal on 29 April 1990. One miracle was required for his sanctification and when news reached the postulation about one such case it was investigated in the diocese of its origin. For one killed \\"in odium fidei\\", no miracle is needed for their beatification but one is needed for sainthood. The C.C.S. validated this process on 1 October 1993 and a medical board approved this on 26 October 1994 as did theologians on 20 March 1998 and the C.C.S. on 20 October 1998. John Paul II approved this miracle on 21 December 1998 and canonized Barbal as a saint on 21 November 1999 in Saint Peter's Square.Canonization of then martyrs and two priests Cirilo Bertr√°n and eight companions, Inocencia de de la Inmaculada, Benedict Menni and Thomas of Cori See also * Jaime Hilario Integrated School-La Salle ‚Äì Bagac in Bataan in the Philippines: Educational institution named after Saint Jaime Hilario Barbal ReferencesExternal links * Hagiography Circle * Saints SQPN * La Salle * Vatican report on the canonization * Category:1889 births Category:1937 deaths Category:20th-century Christian saints Category:20th- century Roman Catholic martyrs Category:Beatifications by Pope John Paul II Category:Canonized Roman Catholic religious brothers Category:Catalan Roman Catholic saints Category:Lasallian saints Category:Executed Spanish people Category:People killed by the Second Spanish Republic Category:People executed by Spain by firing squad Category:People from Pallars Sobir√† Category:People killed in the Spanish Civil War Category:Religious persecution Category:Spanish people of the Spanish Civil War ","title":"Jaime Hilario Barbal"},{"id":"13390089","text":"Shep Unplugged is a segment that airs at halftime during Red Bull New York soccer games on MSG Network.

She graduated from Columbia with a B.A. in history in 2000. Career= CBS (2001‚Äì07)  Regan got her start in 2001 at CBS MarketWatch, then owned partially by CBS News, where she was a business correspondent reporting for the CBS Evening News through 2007. She also contributed to Face the Nation and 48 Hours. Her work on the terror connection between the Tri-Border region of South America and Islamic terrorist groups earned her an Emmy nomination for Investigative Reporting in 2007.

She switched to a traditional conservative talk format for a new primetime show in 2018, titled Trish Regan Primetime. = Denmark comments = In August 2018, Regan likened Denmark to Venezuela. Regan said Denmark's economic model was infeasible, and argued that \\"there's something rotten in Denmark\\". During the segment, Regan sought to demonstrate that the economic model in Denmark was unfeasible.York, Chris (August 13, 2018). \\"Fox Host's Attempt To Warn Of Perils Of Denmark's Socialism Backfires\\". Huffington Post UK. Retrieved August 14, 2018. She made a number of misleading claims about Denmark, including: \\"everyone in Denmark is working for the government\\" and \\"no-one wants to work\\". The segment stirred controversy in both Denmark and the U.S., with news outlets, politicians, experts, and the Danish government noting that, relative to the United States, Denmark is ranked higher on indicators of economic freedom, ease-of-doing- business, happiness, and has higher employment figures. Regan's figures about Danish unemployment were only correct if she included unemployed babies, children, and retired people; Denmark's unemployment rate was actually lower than that of the U.S. Regan also said \\"nobody graduates from school\\" because the government \\"pays\\" students to go to school; according to The Washington Post, while direct comparisons are difficult, less than 60% of US college students finish in six years, whereas in Denmark 79% of undergraduates finish their coursework. The paper noted that this includes American students who can't afford college in the United States. After her remarks were criticized in the US and Danish press, Regan attempted to clarify her remarks, saying: \\"Just to be clear, I was never implying that conditions in Denmark were similar in any way to the current tragedy on the ground there in Venezuela\\". She added, \\"I was merely pointing out, using reports from The Atlantic, The Independent, and other publications, that socialism is not the way.\\" These sources have since rebutted her claim, stating that \\"Our articles do not show that socialism does not definitively work\\". = Coronavirus = On March 9, 2020, amid a coronavirus outbreak, Regan said Democrats had exploited the crisis for political gain as Fox Business ran a chyron saying \\"Coronavirus Impeachment Scam.\\"Stieb, Matt (March 10, 2020). \\"Fox Business Network: COVID-19 Is a 'Coronavirus Impeachment Scam'\\".

It is also called a bit array or bitmap index. As a noun, the term \\"bitmap\\" is very often used to refer to a particular bitmapping application: the pix-map, which refers to a map of pixels, where each one may store more than two colors, thus using more than one bit per pixel. In such a case, the domain in question is the array of pixels which constitute a digital graphic output device (a screen or monitor). In some contexts, the term bitmap implies one bit per pixel, while pixmap is used for images with multiple bits per pixel. A bitmap is a type of memory organization or image file format used to store digital images. The term bitmap comes from the computer programming terminology, meaning just a map of bits, a spatially mapped array of bits. Now, along with pixmap, it commonly refers to the similar concept of a spatially mapped array of pixels. Raster images in general may be referred to as bitmaps or pixmaps, whether synthetic or photographic, in files or memory. Many graphical user interfaces use bitmaps in their built-in graphics subsystems; for example, the Microsoft Windows and OS/2 platforms' GDI subsystem, where the specific format used is the Windows and OS/2 bitmap file format, usually named with the file extension of \`.BMP\` (or \`.DIB\` for device- independent bitmap). Besides BMP, other file formats that store literal bitmaps include InterLeaved Bitmap (ILBM), Portable Bitmap (PBM), X Bitmap (XBM), and Wireless Application Protocol Bitmap (WBMP). Similarly, most other image file formats, such as JPEG, TIFF, PNG, and GIF, also store bitmap images (as opposed to vector graphics), but they are not usually referred to as bitmaps, since they use compressed formats internally. Pixel storage In typical uncompressed bitmaps, image pixels are generally stored with a variable number of bits per pixel which identify its color, the color depth. Pixels of 8 bits and fewer can represent either grayscale or indexed color. An alpha channel (for transparency) may be stored in a separate bitmap, where it is similar to a grayscale bitmap, or in a fourth channel that, for example, converts 24-bit images to 32 bits per pixel. The bits representing the bitmap pixels may be packed or unpacked (spaced out to byte or word boundaries), depending on the format or device requirements. Depending on the color depth, a pixel in the picture will occupy at least n/8 bytes, where n is the bit depth. For an uncompressed, packed within rows, bitmap, such as is stored in Microsoft DIB or BMP file format, or in uncompressed TIFF format, a lower bound on storage size for a n-bit-per-pixel (2n colors) bitmap, in bytes, can be calculated as: :size = width ‚Ä¢ height ‚Ä¢ n/8, where height and width are given in pixels. In the formula above, header size and color palette size, if any, are not included. Due to effects of row padding to align each row start to a storage unit boundary such as a word, additional bytes may be needed. Device-independent bitmaps and BMP file format Microsoft has defined a particular representation of color bitmaps of different color depths, as an aid to exchanging bitmaps between devices and applications with a variety of internal representations. They called these device-independent bitmaps as DIBs, and the file format for them is called DIB file format or BMP file format. According to Microsoft support: > A device-independent bitmap (DIB) is a format used to define device- > independent bitmaps in various color resolutions. The main purpose of DIBs > is to allow bitmaps to be moved from one device to another (hence, the > device-independent part of the name). A DIB is an external format, in > contrast to a device-dependent bitmap, which appears in the system as a > bitmap object (created by an application...). A DIB is normally transported > in metafiles (usually using the StretchDIBits() function), BMP files, and > the Clipboard (CF_DIB data format). Here, \\"device independent\\" refers to the format, or storage arrangement, and should not be confused with device-independent color. Other bitmap file formats The X Window System uses a similar XBM format for black-and-white images, and XPM (pixelmap) for color images. Numerous other uncompressed bitmap file formats are in use, though most not widely. For most purposes standardized compressed bitmap files such as GIF, PNG, TIFF, and JPEG are used; lossless compression in particular provides the same information as a bitmap in a smaller file size. TIFF and JPEG have various options. JPEG is usually lossy compression. TIFF is usually either uncompressed, or lossless Lempel-Ziv-Welch compressed like GIF. PNG uses deflate lossless compression, another Lempel-Ziv variant. There are also a variety of \\"raw\\" image files, which store raw bitmaps with no other information; such raw files are just bitmaps in files, often with no header or size information (they are distinct from photographic raw image formats, which store raw unprocessed sensor data in a structured container such as TIFF format along with extensive image metadata).

With an apparent visual magnitude of 7.21, this star is too faint to be in naked eye visibility. It is located at a distance of 151 light years from the Sun based on parallax, and is drifting further away with a radial velocity of +36.7 km/s. This object is a G-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of G0/2 V. It is positioned 0.6 magnitudes above the main sequence, which may be explained by a high metallicity and an older age. Vogt et al. (2005) estimated its age as about 6.2 billion years, although more recent estimates give a younger age of around 2.4 billion years. The star has 1.31 times the mass of the Sun and 1.42 times the Sun's radius. It is radiating 2.38 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,099 K. As of 2005, at least one extrasolar planet has been confirmed to be orbiting the star.  Planetary system  The first planet discovered, HD 50499 b, is a gas giant with mass of 1.7 times Jupiter. It is a long period, taking 351 weeks to orbit the star. The planet's eccentric orbit passes through the average distance of 574 Gm or 18.6 Œºpc. The planet was discovered by four team members including Steven Vogt in 2005 using their radial velocity method, which used to measure changes in red- and blue-shifting of the star that indicate the presence of planets caused by gravitational tug. There is also a linear trend in the radial velocities, which may indicate an additional outer planet. The best two-planet model gives a different period and mass for the inner planet (9.8 years and 3.4 Jupiter masses), with an outer planet of 2.1 Jupiter masses in a 37-year orbit. However the two-planet model does not represent a significant improvement over the model with one planet and a linear trend, so more observations are needed to constrain the parameters of the outer planet. Rickman et al. (2019) gave updated models of the planets and their orbits, shown below.

He was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 2003. Biography Samuelson was born on a dairy farm in Ontario, Wisconsin, near LaCrosse. He considered becoming a Lutheran pastor before deciding on six months of radio school. His early work was based in Wisconsin, at WKLJ in Sparta, WHBY in Appleton, and WBAY-TV/AM in Green Bay. He is best known for his association with WGN Radio in Chicago, serving as the station's head agriculture broadcaster since 1960. In May of 1960, one of Mr. Samuelson's first assignments for WGN was to Emcee the National Barn Dance, a long running program that WGN had just acquired when WLS radio discontinued its association with Prairie Farmer Magazine. WLS had become \\"The Station With Personality\\" and started playing Rock and Roll. Three years into his tenure at WGN, he was the staffer that read the news of the John F. Kennedy assassination. He currently co-hosts (with associate Max Armstrong) the Morning Show on Saturdays. In addition, Samuelson hosts a three-minute daily \\"National Farm Report\\", and a weekly commentary, \\"Samuelson Sez\\"; both are syndicated to various stations across the country. In the 1960s, Samuelson hosted an early-morning show on WGN-TV, Top 'O' the Morning, first with organist Harold Turner, then with Armstrong. From 1975 to 2005, Samuelson also was the host of U.S. Farm Report, a weekly television news magazine dedicated to agriculture; U.S. Farm Report has continued without Samuelson since his departure. Samuelson now hosts a similar show, This Week in Agribusiness, along with Armstrong. Both shows have aired in first-run syndication. Politically, Samuelson is a significant supporter of the use of ethanol fuel as derived from corn, as he feels its use will help American farmers. On the lighter side, Samuelson and a studio group dubbed the \\"Uff da Band\\" once recorded covers of Yogi Yorgesson's novelty songs I Yust Go Nuts at Christmas and Yingle Bells.

During the 1970s the US Air Force saw a need to implement the measures to protect the health of personnel. It took elements of Military Public Health and spun off a separate arm called Bioenvironmental Engineering. From that point Bioenvironmental Engineering has taken the lead in protecting the health of Air Force workers. The original group of Bioenvironmental Engineers (BEEs) came to the Air Force from the U.S. Army in 1947 when the Air Force was formed. They were an outgrowth of the U.S. Army Sanitary Corps. Until 1964, Air Force BEEs were called Sanitary and Industrial Hygiene Engineers. They were Medical Service Corps (MSC) officers until the Biomedical Sciences Corps (BSC) was created in 1965. Between 1960 and 1970, the BEE field grew from around 100 to 150. However, beginning in 1970, with the formation of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the career field experienced an exponential growth in Federal regulations. These laws require BEEs to monitor Air Force operations for their effects on personnel and the environment. Several major catastrophes and other events focused keen Congressional interest on environment, safety and occupational health (ESOH), leading to new, mandatory compliance programs. Love Canal, Bhopal, atmospheric ozone depletion, and other incidents spawned new laws governing the Installation Restoration Program; Hazard Communication; community-right-to-know; Process Safety Management; and hazardous material inventory, control and reduction. These have continually driven additional, corresponding requirements for BEEs. In the early 1980s, a major shift in functions occurred. The clinical and sanitary aspects of the BEE program, (communicable disease, sanitary surveys, vector control, and occupational medicine) were turned over to the newly forming environmental health officers. This enabled the BEE force to concentrate its efforts on the industrial work place and the environment. The importance of ensuring Air Force compliance with ESOH requirements is higher than ever. Public awareness/concern/disclosure, the recognition of risk analysis/communication/management, loss of sovereign immunity of federal agencies, and the personal liability of commanders for environmental infractions are all impacting BEE surveillance programs. Increased environmental pollution prevention and occupational health preventive medicine programs are shifting the emphasis to avoiding problems before they occur. right Bioenvironmental Engineering personnel are taught at the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. Bioenvironmental Engineering blends engineering and preventive medicine. Their role is to identify and evaluate environments that could harm Air Force members, employees, and families. The data from these evaluations help design measures that prevent illness and injury.

The National Map, accessed May 13, 2011 Historic interest Sugar Creek, during early historic times, offered a habitat for one of the southernmost groves of sugar maples in Illinois Territory. This fact, and the fertility of the surrounding prairie land, made the Sugar Creek drainage a focus of interest for early American pioneers immediately after the end of the War of 1812. A six-member kinship group led by Robert Pulliam built homestead cabins on the creek in 1817 near what is now the unincorporated suburban village of Glenarm. Many pioneers followed Pulliam's group to Sugar Creek in the 1820s and following years, helping to settle central Illinois and building a community of primarily southern heritage. In 1880, township authorities built a Burr arch covered bridge, the Sugar Creek Covered Bridge, going east-west over Sugar Creek near the site of the original sugar maple grove and Robert Pulliam's long-vanished cabin. The covered bridge has a span of 60 feet (18 m). , the covered bridge is one of only four covered bridges remaining in Illinois that are classified as original.

On 24 December 2017, President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski pardoned him on health grounds. The pardon was overturned by the Peruvian Supreme Court in October 2018. Exile in Japan After Fujimori fled to Japan, the government of Peru requested his extradition. Because Japan recognizes Fujimori as a Japanese citizen rather than a Peruvian citizen due to the Master Nationality Rule, and because Japan refuses to extradite its citizens to other countries, Fujimori was not extradited from Japan. Arrest in Chile On 6 November 2005, Alberto Fujimori unexpectedly arrived in Santiago, Chile, on a private aircraft, having flown via Tijuana from Tokyo. His flight had passed through Peruvian airspace on its path from Mexico to Chile. There were numerous firings over alleged negligence in the handling of the Fujimori flight to Chile. As investigations continued, two Chilean and four Mexican immigration officers were dismissed for failing to notify superiors of Fujimori's stop at the time of his arrival. Colonel Carlos Medel, head of Interpol in Lima, was also fired for negligence, apparently having ordered his staff to switch off the 24-hour Interpol warning system at the time of the overflight. Mexican officials suggested Fujimori was not arrested in Mexico because there was no judicial order for his arrest. Peruvian president Alejandro Toledo, after learning of the arrival of Fujimori in Chile, called for an \\"urgent meeting\\" in the governmental palace. Toledo called Chile's foreign minister, Ignacio Walker, and requested the detention of Fujimori. A few hours later, Fujimori was detained on an arrest warrant issued by a Chilean judge, who was told by Chile's Supreme Court to consider Lima's request for Fujimori's pre-trial detention, as part of the extradition process.Fujimori arrested on visit to Chile Fujimori was then transferred to the School of Investigations, Chile's Investigative Police academy, where he spent the night. Notified of the reasons for his arrest, Fujimori petitioned for provisional freedom during the extradition proceedings, but his petition was denied. Later in the day, he was transferred to the School of Gendarmerie, a training academy for corrections officers, where he was detained until May 2006. Extradition proceedings The decision whether or not to extradite Fujimori was delegated by the Chilean government to the Supreme Court, following precedent dating to a 1932 extradition treaty between the two nations. Chilean law suggests that in addition to the terms of the treaty, extradition requests must also be based on whether there is sufficient evidence against the accused ‚Äì not necessarily enough to convict him of the charges, but sufficient to justify (from a Chilean legal point of view) the indictments the accused faces. This meant that Peruvian prosecutors had to demonstrate that the crimes for which Fujimori has been charged in Peru were just as severe in Chile.Benjamin Witte, Fujimori Nearly Chokes to Death in His Chile Home, The Santiago Times 10 February 2007. Peru, which had sixty days to issue an extradition request, sent a high-level delegation led by Interior Minister R√≥mulo Pizarro and a top prosecutor. The government of Japan asked for \\"fair treatment\\" for Fujimori. On 18 May 2006 Fujimori was granted bail (set at US$2,830) by the Chilean Supreme Court and was released from detention and whisked away to a house rented for him by his family in the Las Condes neighborhood of Santiago. According to Fujii Takahiko, one of the Japanese financiers who had been covering some of Fujimori's expenses, \\"Fujimori [calmly waited] for the decision of the Chilean Supreme Court because he [had] the assurance that he [would] not be extradited.\\" It was reported that Fujii covered the cost of renting the house, while a cadre of businessmen and Japanese friends covered his living expenses. Fujii, a car exporter by trade, reported that Fujimori had largely forgotten his knowledge of the Japanese language.,Aseguran que grupo de empresarios financia gastos de Fujimori en Chile (Spanish) Summary at the \\"Living in Peru\\" website Because he was granted provisional freedom, Fujimori was not allowed to leave Chile. There were fears among some Peruvians that he could have escaped from the country. Fujimori arrived at a time of tense relations between Chile and Peru, after Peru's Congress passed a law the previous week in an attempt to reclaim sea territory from Chile. Chilean foreign minister, Ignacio Walker, said Fujimori's action demonstrated \\"a very imprudent, very irresponsible attitude, considering this is the most difficult week we have had with Peru in the last decade\\". In a media statement, Fujimori said that he would stay in Chile temporarily while launching his candidacy for Peruvian president in the April 2006 elections. The government of Peru sent a number of extradition requests to Chile concerning Fujimori. It requested his extradition to stand trial for murder in the cases of the Barrios Altos massacre and the La Cantuta massacre, both carried out by Grupo Colina. It also requested his extradition for kidnapping Samuel Dyer and Gustavo Gorriti, both of whom were abducted by Peruvian Army personnel during Fujimori's self- coup and brought to the basements of the Intelligence Service. Additionally, he was charged with usurpation of powers and abuse of authority for ordering the illegal search and seizure of a house owned by Vladimiro Montesinos' wife; illicit association to commit a crime, embezzlement, and inserting false statements in a public document for paying Montesinos US$15 million; illicit association to commit a crime and active corruption of authorities for paying congressmen to switch parties and inform on the opposition parties; telephonic interference or eavesdropping, illicit association to commit a crime, and embezzlement for authorizing the illegal wiretapping of opposition figure's phones; and illicit association to commit a crime, embezzlement, and usurpation of powers for engaging in a fraudulent purchase of tractors from China and bribing newspapers and television stations with state money in order to obtain favorable news coverage. Subsequently, the Chilean judge overseeing the extradition proceedings refused to accept new evidence regarding the 10 corruption and two human rights charges, which, according to the BBC News' Dan Collyns, \\"would have prolonged the case by several months\\".Fujimori judge rejects case delay On 22 November 2006, the Peruvian government issued a new arrest warrant for Fujimori, alleging that he ordered the death of 20 members of Sendero Luminoso in 1992. Fujimori denied the charge.Peru issues new warrant for Fujimori On 11 January 2007 Chile's Supreme Court rejected a motion for an additional investigation filed by lawyers representing Fujimori. The new ruling coincided with the Peruvian government's anger over a recent Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR) ruling that found Peru guilty of crimes committed during former president's regime.Fujimori pulls Lima in opposite directions The Peruvian government expressed fresh concern that Fujimori might try to escape from Chile.Chile-Peru, Old and New Tensions, Prensa Latina Although Fujimori was on parole, with stipulations banning him from leaving Chile, at the end of January 2007 he traveled to a beach resort aboard a private airplane. On 1 February 2007 Reuters reported that the Peruvian government's final report on Fujimori's extradition included additional evidence supporting the former president's links to human rights abuses. In the words of Carlos Briceno, Peru's special corruption prosecutor, \\"We've practically finished the report, in which there is irrefutable proof [against Fujimori]\\". For his part, Fujimori denied the human rights and embezzlement charges. Pedro Fujimori On 8 February 2007 the Peruvian government filed a formal request with the United States for the extradition of Fujimori's younger brother, Pedro Fujimori. According to the head of the Peruvian Justice Ministry's Unit for Extraditions, Omar Chehade, Pedro Fujimori was charged with corruption associated with reception of illegal donations for an NGO, Apenkai, founded at the outset of Fujimori's first term in office. Chehade reported to Reuters that Pedro Fujimori oversaw Japanese donations to the Peruvian government, and that he allegedly siphoned off as much as US$30 million into his own personal bank accounts in the United States. A spokesperson for the Fujimorista party, Congressman Carlos Raffo, denied the charges calling them unsubstantiated, and noted that there are no signs of corruption on the part of Pedro Fujimori.Peru files extradition request for brother of ex-President Fujimori Chilean judge rejects Fujimori extradition On 20 July 2007 the Chilean Supreme Court judge Orlando √Ålvarez, ruled that he had not found any evidence linking former president Alberto Fujimori with all the corruption cases and alleged human rights violations of which the Toledo congress had accused him.Excerpts from Judge Orlando √Ålvarez Hern√°ndez‚Äôs decision regarding the extradition of Alberto Fujimori from Chile to Peru . Translated by Michael Baney. Judge √Ålvarez stated that all the accusations were based on hearsay; \\"he [Fujimori] was supposed to know those criminal acts\\". The opinion was immediately appealed to the Supreme Court. Chilean Supreme Court grants Fujimori extradition The Chilean Supreme Court granted Fujimori's extradition to Peru on 21 September 2007, on 7 of 13 charges. The Barrios Altos massacre and La Cantuta massacre related charges were accepted unanimously, while four other corruption-related charges were passed by a majority of votes. One corruption charge was passed unanimously.Chile's Supreme Court grants Fujimori's extradition to Peru On the same day, Peruvian police sent an airplane to receive Fujimori. The plane (with Peru's General Director of National Police, David Rodriguez, four Interpol officers and physicians) arrived in Santiago on the morning of 22 September. The following day, the plane returned to Lima's Las Palmas air force base with Fujimori on board. He was flown by helicopter to a police base, to be held in detention until a permanent facility was prepared.Peruvian police to take Fujimori back from Chile First conviction Fujimori confessed that he had ordered a warrantless search of Vladimiro Montesinos's wife's apartment, and on 11 December 2007, the Peruvian court sentenced him to six years in prison and fined him 400,000 soles (135,000 U.S. dollars) for abuse of powers in ordering this search, which took place shortly before he left office. Sentence in the case On 10 April 2008, the Supreme Court of Peru upheld Fujimori's sentence of six years in the case.Corte Suprema de la Rep√∫blica. 10 December 2008. Resolution 17-2008 . Peruvian general elections Martha Ch√°vez was S√≠ Cumple's presidential candidate in the April 9, 2006 general election (under the Alianza por el Futuro banner). Fujimori's daughter, Keiko Fujimori was a congressional candidate representing the same alliance. While Ch√°vez got 7.43% of the first-round vote (placed 4th) for presidency and was eliminated, Keiko Fujimori received the highest vote for any single candidate (with 602,869 votes) and took one of S√≠ Cumple's 13 seats in the new Congress.2006 Peru Election Results (Spanish) Some of S√≠ Cumple's members have occupied powerful positions in congress, such as Luisa Mar√≠a Cuculiza, who was first elected to Congress in 2006; Rolando Souza, who was formerly Alberto Fujimori's lawyer and later appointed to the Constitutional Court; and Santiago Fujimori, who was president of the Energy Committee. Keiko Fujimori, was president of the Peruvian-Chilean Friendship Commission. Japanese politics In June 2007, Fujimori announced his candidacy for the House of Councillors, the upper house of the Diet of Japan, under the banner of the People's New Party, a minor party with only eight lawmakers. Still under house arrest in Chile at the time, Fujimori's initial campaign statements were conveyed by party head Shizuka Kamei. Japan's government had determined in 2000 that Fujimori holds Japanese citizenship. The Japanese Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications issued a statement in response, pointing out that there is no law banning participation in an election by someone under house arrest in a foreign country.Prisoner Fujimori to run in Japanese elections The announcement sparked speculation that Fujimori's candidacy was a maneuver to win diplomatic immunity as an elected official and avoid trial in Peru. Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said her country's Supreme Court would not be influenced by the move and would soon decide whether to grant an extradition request to return Fujimori to Peru.Fujimori's Japanese intentions On 11 July 2007, Chile's Supreme Court turned down the Peruvian government's request that Fujimori be extradited there to face charges of human rights violations; however he remained under house arrest in Chile and it was unclear whether he would be permitted to depart for Japan. Though much of the Japanese public have a favorable view of Fujimori due to his role in the resolution of the 1997 Japanese embassy hostage crisis, members of the Democratic Party of Japan and the Japanese Communist Party questioned his commitment to Japan and accused him of using the election to avoid justice in Peru.Odd Man Out Japan indicated on 5 July 2007 that it had no plans to ask Chile to allow Alberto Fujimori to return for that month's upper house elections. The leader of the People's New Party had urged Japan's Foreign Minister to take up the issue with the government of Chile.Japan withdraws request to Chile re Alberto Fujimori Fujimori ultimately lost the election. Conviction for human rights abuses On 7 April 2009, a three-judge panel of Peru's Supreme Court convicted Fujimori on charges of human rights abuses, declaring that the \\"charges against him have been proven beyond all reasonable doubt\\".The Judgment Against Fujimori for Human Rights Violations. American University International Law Review. . The panel found him guilty of ordering the Grupo Colina death squad to execute the November 1991 Barrios Altos massacre and the July 1992 La Cantuta massacre, which resulted in the deaths of 25 people, and for taking part in the kidnappings of Peruvian journalist Gustavo Gorriti and businessman Samuel Dyer. Fujimori's conviction marked the first time in history that a democratically elected president had been tried and found guilty of human rights abuses in his own country. Fujimori was already serving a six-year prison sentence for his December 2007 conviction on abuse of power charges. The trial for Fujimori's human rights abuses lasted 15 months, and was postponed on multiple occasions due to his ill health. Later on 7 April, the court sentenced Fujimori to 25 years in prison. Ronald Gamarra Herrera, Executive Secretary of National Coordinator for Human Rights of Peru and one of the lawyers representing the civil parties ‚Äìthe families of the Barrios Altos and La Cantuta victims‚Äì said to the press that \\"there has not been hate, or revenge, or cruelty in Fujimori's trial. What there has been is justice. We are not happy for the pain of a man, nor of what tragedy his family is going through. But yes it is comforting to know that justice has been served and that the victims, after so many years, can rest in peace\\". The Financial Times claimed that international observers had \\"hailed the trial as a model of due process even before the verdict was read out\\". Michael Reed of the International Center for Transitional Justice stated that, \\"Throughout 15 months the whole Peruvian people have been actively living this process. This social engagement is important ‚Ä¶ the decision will in fact demonstrate polarisation. The issue is how the Peruvian state and Peruvian society deal with that polarization towards the future.\\" Maria McFarland, a Senior Researcher for Human Rights Watch, noted that the verdict was \\"absolutely the right decision ... [and] well grounded in all the evidence\\" and that the special court would \\"go down in history as a model of what we want to see in terms of rule of law and justice and progress in Latin America. So much has always been focused on the power of the executive and the president and the strong man; now suddenly the judiciary is having a say.\\" After Fujimori's conviction had been announced, riots broke out in the streets. In the Ate District, approximately twenty police officers had to break up a fight between members of Fujimori's political party and a group from the local Peru's Workers Confederation (CTP). It was believed that the riot broke out when about fifty CTP members went to the police station and provoked a fight with some 300 Fujimori supporters. Outside the court, relatives of victims clashed with Fujimori supporters; the fights were broken up by riot police. Correo, a right-wing newspaper in Lima, published a poll on 9 April claiming that 59.4% was against Fujimori's conviction, with rejection of the sentence reaching 68.3% among the lower classes. Nevertheless, the poll doesn't clarify if those interviewed considered Fujimori innocent or if they considered him guilty but did't approve of the sentence itself. Pardon On 24 December 2017, President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski pardoned Fujimori and seven other prisoners on health grounds. Fujimori had been rushed to the hospital days earlier for low blood pressure and an abnormal heart rhythm, and Kuczynski had been saved from impeachment less than a week earlier, largely due to the support of Fujimori's son Kenji. Fujimori's daughter Keiko had led the impeachment proceedings against Kuczynski, who had defeated her the year before in a tightly contested presidential election. The \\"Christmas pardon\\", as it became known in Spanish, was met with angry protests and at least two resignations from members of Kuczynski's party. The Peruvian non-profit law office Legal Defense Institute denounced the pardon as political and illegal and vowed to appeal it to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The Supreme Court of Peru overturned the pardon in October 2018, calling it unlawful. ReferencesExternal links *APRODEH.

Life and career  In 1970, with 16, Stellest leaves Switzerland and moves to the United States, in Katchina, Arizona, where he paints. At this time, he meets Native American Indians whose life philosophy and approach towards nature will inspire him for the rest of his career. After a few years spent in the desert, Patrice Stellest moves to California. Rapidly, he meets Charles Lemaire, costume designer for Marilyn Monroe. After seeing young Patrice's early costume designs, Charles offers to teach him fashion and design. Already influenced by the work of Max Ernst, Stellest foresees another path and declines the offer. Some time later, he receives a grant from the State of California and joins the experimental animation program at the California Institute of the Arts, in Valencia. There, under the Supervision of Jules Engel, chief animator of Walt Disney‚Äôs Fantasia who becomes his mentor, he studies the techniques of experimental animation and photo-animation, working on such machines as the Oxberry Master Series. He is also offered the opportunity to produce his first animated work, ‚ÄúThe lady bug that wanted to be a flower‚Äù, on Walt Disney‚Äôs first personal Oxberry. Later on, he is accepted at Art Center College of Design, in Pasadena, California, where he studies Art and Cinematography. He then directs a series of short films mixing music and experimental art, convinced before his time of the great future of music videos. Following his idea, he is awarded the first prize of Art Center for his short ‚ÄúPortrait 1982‚Äù, which defends the place of women in the art world. He also directs a series of short films including ‚ÄúAnimas‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Kimono‚Äù, and shows his work to the director of photography's team on Oliver Stone‚Äôs film ‚ÄúThe Doors‚Äù, then in search of visual inspiration. In 1983, Stellest puts together a team in order to take part in the ‚ÄúEquinox‚Äù project of the Olympic Cultural Program of the city of Los Angeles, with the collaboration of scientist Claude Michaux, who coordinated NASA‚Äôs Voyager program in Pasadena. In 1984, Stellest moves to Paris with his life partner, Marie-H√©l√®ne. Together, they take over the studio of Pop artists Claus Oldenburg and James Rosenquist. The couple is expecting a happy event, when following the steps of Max Ernst, they leave Paris for the Touraine region where Stellest learns alone the techniques of welding metal. In 1998, attracted to the South of France, Stellest moves to Saint-R√©my-de-Provence where he enters a very busy time of his life. In 1992, he illustrates the book Grosse Beruhigte K√∂rper edited by Druckhaus Galrev, that owed the German poet Ulrich Zieger the first poetry prize of united Germany. He also spends some time with French painter Ren√© Durbach, who will deeply affect his vision of the movement the French poet Guillaume Apollinaire called Orphism. He also paints the emblematic painting of his career as a painter ‚ÄúThe Hug‚Äù.http://vimeo.com/29671663 During the same time, he improves his technique of metal sculpting by becoming the assistant of Greek sculptor Costa Coulentianos, and meets and shares his universe with Cesar, Dora Maar, Leo Castelli, Harald Szeemann or M. Tate ; who all encourage him to express his new ideas and concepts.  Trans Nature Art  In 1992, Stellest has pioneered the first renewable energy sculpture 'Solar Head\\" for his movement \\"Tran Nature Art\\". In 1994, Stellest illustrates the novel ‚ÄòSchwartzland‚Äô by Ulrich Zieger, published by Qwert Zui Op√º, before pulling back to work on his new projects. During this time, he works with the assistant of Jean Tinguely Martin B√ºhler, and the artist physicist Bernard Gittonhttp://vimeo.com/groups/stellest/videos/28461780 on a new style of artworks carrying the message of protection of nature and the environment. The main sculpture of this movement is ‚ÄòThe Solar Head‚Äù, built in 1997.http://vimeo.com/groups/stellest/videos/29693301 Conceived to run on solar energy at its own rhythm, this sculpture is the first Solar sculpture ever created, and the first of a long series of interactive sculptures allying cutting edge technology and the artist's new message. In 1999, Stellest presents his work as part of a new movement, which he names Trans Nature Art when he exhibits at the Palace of the Arts in Marseille, France. Soon after that, he exhibits his work at the castle of Beatrice de Andia, Head of the Paris Arts Council at an exhibition organized around the theme of nature. Eventually, in 2001, he is the guest of Palexpo, in Geneva, where he officially presents Trans Nature Art (TNA) to the world. With this movement, Patrice Stellest is considered the founding father of the Renewable energy sculpture field of contemporary art. In 2011, Stellest comes back on the art scene by producing a 3D animated short film ‚ÄòStellest Genesis‚Äô‚Äù,http://vimeo.com/28987732 with dj Moby‚Äôs musical participation. He also illustrates Ulrich Zieger‚Äôs latest book ‚ÄòFirst visit to the refuge‚Äô‚Äù published by Rugerup Editions.

Life Ann Thompson was the daughter of James Thompson (1727-1812) a wealthy Irishman who made his fortune in the merchant trade, and Catharine (Walton) Thompson, daughter of a wealthy New Yorker. By 1750, Thompson's business was based in New York City, where Ann was born in 1763.

He is best remembered for his play Illatszert√°r, also known as Parfumerie, which was used as the storyline for three movies, The Shop Around the Corner, In the Good Old Summertime, and, most recently, You've Got Mail. The play also was adapted for the Broadway stage as the musical She Loves Me. Early life Nicholaus Leitner (Laszlo) was born in Budapest, Hungary in 1903, to a family of German Jewish extraction. Emperor Franz Josef ruled the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Great War was still a few years away. The name \\"L√°szl√≥\\" was chosen for the Leitner family. No particular reason is known other than that it was a well-known Hungarian name and that it was similar (vaguely) to the original family name \\"Leitner\\". Henrik and Ilona Fischer Leitner therefore gave to their infant son on his birth certificate the name Leitner L√°szl√≥ Nicholaus, last name first as is the custom in Hungary. Niki grew up in the hustle and bustle of wartime Budapest. His family was in the entertainment business, and he naturally gravitated toward a career in entertainment as well. He was a clever and witty lad, always amusing friends and family with his quips and characterizations. He rubbed elbows with the Hungarian literati of the day including Ferenc Moln√°r the playwright, whose most famous work Liliom is known to English speaking audiences as the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel. It only made sense then that Niki was encouraged to put pen to paper and as a young adult began to produce his own little one-scene plays for the various small theatres and cabarets around the city. These \\"little plays\\" became his fame and provided spare income to support his \\"young man with possibilities\\" lifestyle. It even afforded him the time to work on some larger more comprehensive works which he would eventually complete as full multi-act plays. Money was no issue for the young L√°szl√≥. His father continued to do very well with his own business endeavors and at one point, anecdotal information describes the father as one of the wealthiest men in Hungary. But tragically, poor management, high living and wild spending brought the family to total destitution. And then unexpectedly his father died and Nicholas was left as the sole provider for his mother and eight siblings. Writing was not sufficient to feed a family and pay the bills, so Niki turned to a host of jobs, none too small to earn the pay that was necessary to keep the family afloat. As he told it, he worked as a candy-maker, collar salesman, necktie agent, script typist, clerk and even worked as a laborer in a petroleum factory while siblings grew up and gradually took responsibility for their own lives and livelihoods. It came then as a great satisfaction that his first three-act play, A legboldogabb ember, The Happiest Man, a play about an embittered factory worker and the dreamworld to which he escapes for solace, won him the prestigious Hungarian Royal Academy Award for Literature in 1934, the Hungarian equivalent of the American Pulitzer Prize - quite an achievement for a man barely into his 30s. Immigration to America L√°szl√≥ could have stayed in Hungary, but World War II was approaching, and Hungarians of Jewish extraction knew that the smart money was on leaving the old world behind and heading to America. So in 1938, Nicholaus L√°szl√≥ pulled up his stakes and embarked for the USA. He quickly established himself in the local Hungarian community on the lower east side of New York City, bringing his charm and reputation to an immigrant audience clamoring for all things Hungarian and, as everyone else, for relief from the Great Depression that was gripping the nation. He was, for a time, the \\"toast of the town\\", locally at least. He now called himself Mikl√≥s L√°szl√≥, a purely Hungarian name giving him full acceptance and cachet within the community. But fame in the insular Hungarian language-speaking community of Yorkville, Manhattan, New York is not the same as making it as a playwright to a larger English-speaking American audience. Mikl√≥s, that is \\"Miki\\", would need to further pursue his opportunities. In the fall of 1939 he married Florence Herrman, an aspiring young actress and the daughter of a successful local entrepreneur, a Cunard Line travel agent, landlord and financial exchange merchant. On December 28, 1944 he completed the transition and became a fully naturalized American citizen and officially adopted the single name now most frequently referenced, Mikl√≥s L√°szl√≥. During his lifetime he had numerous writing contracts with MGM. A few projects became major motion pictures, most did not. The writing experiments and the accompanying advances though kept Miki and wife Florence able to make ends meet, barely. Again, other jobs became a necessity. Mikl√≥s L√°szl√≥ died in New York City in 1973 at the age of 69. His wife Florence died in 1987. Parfumerie Most famous of all the plays that became produced as a motion picture during this time was Illatszert√°r, known in English as Parfumerie. It had premiered at the Pest Theatre in Budapest in 1937,Papiruszportal.hu: L√°szl√≥ Mikl√≥s: Illatszert√°r Linked 2014-01-05 and shortly after L√°szl√≥ came to New York, the play was adapted as a movie script by Samson Raphaelson and became the Ernst Lubitsch motion picture The Shop Around the Corner (1940), with James Stewart, Frank Morgan, and Margaret Sullavan. A few years later it was re-filmed as In the Good Old Summertime (1949), a semi-musical showcase for Judy Garland, starring Garland, Van Johnson, and S. Z. Sakall. In 1963, the play was produced as a full Broadway musical called She Loves Me; with book by Joe Masteroff and was titled She Loves Me. She Loves Me had music by Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock (Fiorello!, Fiddler on the Roof, The Apple Tree) and was nominated for 5 Tony Awards including Best Musical, with Jack Cassidy winning for Best Performance by a Featured Actor in a Musical. She Loves Me is also often referred to as the \\"Ice Cream Musical\\" because of a signature song and performance by Barbara Cook. She Loves Me was revived in 1993 by the Roundabout Theatre Company and ran for 354 performances. It was nominated for 9 Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical as well as in all four acting categories, with Boyd Gaines winning for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical. It was revived again in 2016 for a limited run at Studio 54 from February to July and was nominated for 8 Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical, with David Rockwell winning for Best Scenic Design of a Musical. In 1998, the play was used once again as the inspiration for a screenplay, by Nora Ephron, which became the motion picture You've Got Mail, with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. In 2001, the Laszlo/Raphaelson MGM script was adapted for the stage in France and was produced as a straight play La Boutique au Coin de la Rue (\\"The Shop at the Corner of the Street\\"). This production was a faithful adaptation of the MGM movie script The Shop Around the Corner and ran for the 2002 season in Paris at the Th√©√¢tre Montparnasse winning top honors. The production garnered five Moli√®re Awards, the French equivalent of the American Tony Award ‚Äî for Best New Play, Best Adaptation of a Foreign Work, Best Director, Best Set Design, and Best Lighting. In June 2004 Parfumerie was produced for the first time as an English-language play by the theater department of the University of Illinois, after James Berton Harris, the director of the department's Summerfest, found a translation of the original script in papers donated by Samson Raphaelson to the university's Rare Book and Special Collections Library.Julie Kistler, \\"North American Premiere of PARFUMERIE?\\", AFollowSpot.com Linked 2019-07-11.Susie An, \\"Summerfest at Krannert,\\" Buzz, 2004-06-17, page 6, Linked 2019-07-11. A new adaptation of the play by E. P.

Almost simultaneously, a script adapted by Adam Pettle and Brenda Robins was produced by the Soulpepper Theatre Company in Toronto.Christopher Hoile, \\"Review: Parfumerie\\", Stage-Door.com Linked 2019-07-11. Other plays and screenplays In the early 1940s he also wrote a screenplay Katherine which was picked up by MGM and became the motion picture The Big City (1948) starring Margaret O'Brien, Robert Preston, Danny Thomas and George Murphy. The screenplay examined the diversity and underlying unity of human cultures in the microcosm of a New York City adoption. Only one other of Miklos Laszlo's plays was ever widely produced in the Americas. Entitled St. Lazar's Pharmacy it is the story of a man learning the lessons of the true value of ‚Äúhome‚Äù as compared to the many lures of a false and deceiving world of empty promises. The play starred famed actress Miriam Hopkins and toured all over Canada and the United States. (The Juilliard library lists a handwritten manuscript of \\"St. Lazar's Pharmacy\\" in its catalogue of collections.) Perhaps the reason we have not seen very many of the plays Miklos Laszlo wrote in his early career and during his life is because they were never effectively translated from Hungarian to English and as such have never really had an opportunity to be viewed by American audiences as they were viewed in the country of his birth.
