The first mention in relation to the history of the religion came in the 1860s in a newspaper article. Following this the first individual from South Carolina to find the religion was Louis Gregory in 1909, followed by individuals inside the state. Communities of Bah√° º√≠s were soon operating in North Augusta, Columbia and Greenville struggled with segregation culture through the 1950s externally and internally. However, in the 1969-1973 period, a very remarkable and somewhat unsustainable period of conversions to the religion on the basis of a meeting of Christian and Bah√° º√≠ religious ideas established a basis of community across several counties - notably Marion, Williamsburg, and Dillon, served by the Louis Gregory Institute and its radio station WLGI but also across the wider area. That community continues and has gathered news coverage as part of the second largest religion in South Carolina. 1970 - a pivotal year for the Bah√° º√≠s in South Carolina too Early history Firsts The first connections of South Carolina with the Bah√° º√≠ Faith occur in the presence of the first Bah√° º√≠ to join the religion in the West with his service in the American Civil War in South Carolina 30 years before he would join the religion, followed by re-publication of the first paper to mention events related to the history of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. =1864-5= After seeking out training to be an officer black infantry units, by May, 1864, Thornton Chase, later recognized as the first occidental Bah√° º√≠, was second in charge of one hundred men, Company K of the 26th Regiment Infantry U.S. Colored Troops which fought two battles south of Charleston, S.C. and was wounded. He then sought out a second opportunity to serve and in 1865 was promoted to captain and commanded Company D of the 104th United States Colored Infantry.* * That unit was organized at Beaufort, S. C., April‚ÄìJune, 1865, and did guard duty at various points in South Carolina till February, 1866. Chase' resignation was accepted November 7, 1865, in Beaufort, S. C.* * The law referenced in that cited is here: He would join the religion 30 years later. Louis Gregory's father, George Gregory, was First Sergeant in Company C of the 104th in 1866. The first mention related to the history of the religion known in South Carolina was in a newspaper article. It was published in June 1865 in The Daily Phoenix of Columbia, South Carolina, on the front page, reviewing events that occurred from 1844‚Äì1850 or so. The source of the extended quote is not named, and makes mistakes typical of the period. See also Josephus on Jesus. It was originally presented in an article in The Literary World of June 14, 1851, as a letter dated February 10, 1851, by Dr. Rev. Austin H. Wright to the American Oriental Society. It was subsequently also published in a newspaper June 26, 1851, and was published in a German newspaper in 1851 translated by his superior, Rev. Justin Perkins. Wright, father of Lucy Myers Wright Mitchell and John Henry Wright, was a medical missionary from New England, and gained his medical degree in Virginia. Wright was the first person to write a paper giving an account on B√°bism, and died in what was then called Urumiah, Persia, January 14, 1865. The Daily Phoenix itself began publication March 1865 after Sherman's March to the Sea that burned a third of the city or more and by April was being published as a daily paper. =Louis George Gregory= Louis George Gregory was the first person from South Carolina to join the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. He was born on June 6, 1874 in Charleston, South Carolina to African-American parents liberated during the Civil War along with his future stepfather 1st Sgt. George Gregory. During his elementary schooling, Gregory attended the first public school that was open to both African Americans and Whites in Charleston and then the Avery Institute, the leading school for Americans of African descent in Charleston, and gave the graduation speech entitled, \\"Thou Shalt Not Live For Thyself Alone.\\" Gregory attended Fisk University, Howard University, and was admitted to the bar in Washington D.C. in 1902. In 1906 Gregory started to work in the United States Department of the Treasury, and continued to rise in society in various forms of service to the community and the profession. Meanwhile, Gregory was visible in the newspapers over racist incidents. While at the Treasury Department Gregory heard of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith and attended a lecture by Lua Getsinger, a leading Bah√° º√≠, in 1907. In that meeting he met Pauline Hannen, raised in Wilmington North Carolina, and her husband and they invited him to many other meetings. Gregory was much affected by the behavior of the Hannens and the religion after having become disillusioned with Christianity. Unbeknown to Gregory, the next known newspaper article mentioning the early days of the religion in South Carolina was in 1909 when The Manning Times printed a somewhat inaccurate article on the B√°b. 1909 was also a year of changes for Gregory - he joined the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, received a personal letter from  ªAbdu'l-Baha, then head of the religion, was elected president of the Bethel Literary and Historical Society, and left the Treasury Department and established his practice in Washington D.C. On July 23, 1909 Gregory wrote to the Hannens that he was an adherent of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith: > It comes to me that I have never taken occasion to thank you specifically > for all your kindness and patience, which finally culminated in my > acceptance of the great truths of the Bah√° º√≠ Revelation. It has given me an > entirely new conception of Christianity and of all religion, and with it my > whole nature seems changed for the better...It is a sane and practical > religion, which meets all the varying needs of life, and I hope I shall ever > regard it as a priceless possession. The letter from  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° said in part > I hope that thou mayest become‚Ä¶ the means whereby the white and colored > people shall close their eyes to racial differences and behold the reality > of humanity, that is the universal truth which is the oneness of the kingdom > of the human race‚Ä¶. Rely as much as thou canst on the True One, and be thou > resigned to the Will of God, so that like unto a candle thou mayest be > enkindled in the world of humanity and like unto a star thou mayest shine > and gleam from the Horizon of Reality and become the cause of the guidance > of both races. In 1910 Gregory stopped working as a lawyer and began a lifelong service to the religion largely by holding meetings and traveling for the religion and wrote and lectured on the subject of racial unity and the religion. That year Gregory initiated a major trip through the South to promulgate the religion. He travelled to Richmond, Virginia, Durham, North Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, the city of his family and childhood, and Macon, Georgia. After this first trip Gregory went on pilgrimage and was elected to positions in the religion and worked on concerns in race-integration in Washington D.C. which were settled with  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s visit, and his marriage - Gregory eventually returned to traveling to promote the religion but his endeavors were national in scope against a backdrop of societal challenges like Lynching in the United States and Jim Crow laws amidst Racism in the United States and instances of Mass racial violence in the United States. =Alonzo Twine= Advertisement for Alonzo E. Twine, Attorney at law (no picture known for him) Where Gregory had gone on to be a lawyer in 1902 in the relative North, African-American Alonzo E. Twine became a practicing lawyer registered with the South Carolina Supreme Court by 1897 and argued cases into 1910. This did not prevent him from being beaten publicly by another lawyer in 1903. His father was a freeborn carpenter and Union army veteran, his mother a domestic servant. This was during the Tillman era and disfranchisement, 1890‚Äì1914. Gregory spoke at a number of engagements in Charleston in 1910 and encountered a minister who had been to Green Acre and heard of the religion. Gregory also addressed the group of local Black lawyers. Twine, a trustee of the Old Bethel United Methodist Church, was the first to identify himself as a Bah√° º√≠ in South Carolina. Gregory wrote to the Hannen's of it \\"‚Ä¶[Twine] was particularly impressed with the explanation concerning 'clouds.' He added that if Christ were to come thru the literal clouds, he certainly would be hidden from half the earth, in view of its roundness.\\" Gregory left and would be away for a number of years. In the meantime, unbeknownst to Gregory, a year later Twine was committed to a mental institution by his mother and family priest, Rev. I. E. Lowery, for \\"religious obsession\\" though he hadn't lost any work and wasn't a threat to himself or others but was judged a threat to society. He died three years later, October 26, 1914. Lowery was still using his knowledge of the fate of Twine to warn those interested in hearing Gregory's message a few years later. Sporadic to Sustained community A significant starting point in the growth of a stable presence of the religion was around 1911 when Margaret Klebs, from Prussia, after joining the religion, settled in Augusta Georgia. She learned of the religion at Green Acre circa 1901 and was living and working in the Augusta-North August-Aiken area by 1911. She also met  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° when he visited the US in 1912 including a private interview directing her to return to the South and promote the religion. By the winter of 1912-13 she was back in the Augusta-North August-Aiken area. In March 1912 and May 1913 she arranged for a music programs. Society editor Julia Moore of the Augusta Herald became friends with Klebs and a student of the religion and publicized events - and various students of Klebs also investigated the religion and several enrolled. In 1914 Klebs invited Joseph Hannen for a series of talks - James U. Jackson's mansion, at the African-American Schofield Normal and Industrial School, and there was a concert again at the Hampton Terrace hotel. Klebs and the small group of Bah√° º√≠s managed to have several stories in the local paper in 1915 and 1917. At the time there was a brief mention of a Bah√° º√≠ presence at the Panama-Pacific Exposition in 1915. By 1918 the community included six individuals - G. P. Talbot, Louise Biggar Talbot, Ann McKennie Verdery, Myrtis Tinsley, Julia Moore, Robert Irvin - though two had moved to Savannah, Georgia, and another was added in 1920 - Esther Sego. Louise was the community delegate to the 1919 nations convention. Bah√° º√≠ speakers continued to be invited and in 1920 Assadu'llah Mazindarani - a designated scholar sent by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° - addressed a colored audience of some 65 men who left with \\"tears in their eyes.\\" There were a variety of minor mentions of the religion in newspapers from the 1920s to the 1940s. =Tablets of the Divine Plan= Though interrupted by World War I, in 1916‚Äì1919 the Tablets of the Divine Plan were written by  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° and released in stages - calling for attention in various areas including a delineation of \\"the southern states\\" noting \\"‚Ä¶ you must either go yourselves or send a number of blessed souls to those states, so that they may guide the people to the kingdom of heaven.\\" Joseph Hannen, Gregory, and two others set their focus on the South starting in 1916. This was during a period of both strong White power structures, the first organizations of the NAACP in South Carolina, and spreading violence and intimidation, the \\"resurgent\\" Ku Klux Klan and moderate YMCA and YWCA organizations that kept an \\"absolute loyalty to the principle of racial integrity.\\" Gregory made a trip through South Carolina from Wilmington NC in early 1919 before the April annual Bah√° º√≠ convention and during it the previous Tablets and some new ones were officially unveiled. The new ones included the quote \\"unquestionably the divine teachings must reveal themselves with a brighter effulgence‚Ä¶ and the fragrances of holiness be diffused with swiftness and rapidity\\" comparing the situation with Gregory the Illuminator facing the Armenia of long ago but setting the context in seeking freeing the people from racial prejudice - a line of action he foresaw would have \\"a transforming impact on the United States and the world\\". The Bah√° º√≠s established a national committee to begin overseeing the work and Hannen coordinated the orientation to the South - following which Gregory made a circuit of trips in the winter of 1920 and 1921 between South Carolina and Georgia with the help of Roy Williams who spoke also at Black colleges Benedict College and Allen University. A Bah√° º√≠'s home was firebombed, two were jailed and Persian Bah√° º√≠ Dr Zia Bagdadi aided relief efforts. Another time Gregory and Harlan Ober discussed having \\"mass meetings\\" to alleviate racial tension. In 1921 Gregory focused with Agnes Parsons on a national campaign of hosting Race Amity Conventions. Around and between instances of meetings Gregory spoke at several churches in Columbia and connected with Josiah Morse at the University of South Carolina there who then welcomed Bah√° º√≠s on a number of occasions into the 1930s. Gregory often used the example of Samuel Chiles Mitchell, a past president of the University of South Carolina who had met  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°. Gregory's talk in 1921 in Columbia at Sidney Park Colored Methodist Episcopal Church inspired a full column response by Lowery which was echoed in a number of newspapers with statewide reach. In a situation of a society with widespread methods of White supremacy over BlacksLowery was a voice of accommodation, though he had joined the northern Methodists against his former owner's Southern branch, pointing out the \\"‚Ä¶'best white people' and the newspapers were opposed\\" to the riots and lynchings undertaken against the Blacks because of rapes of White women and that if that were stopped, through the duty of White Christians to gives Blacks \\"pure religion\\", all would be well. Gregory spoke from the pulpit at the morning service and gave a talk in the afternoon. Lowery condemned the talk as \\"unchristian and devoid of spirit\\" - \\"a head religion, and not a heart religion\\". Lowery listed principles of the religion Gregory had noted and then warned the reader of the case of the young Black lawyer who had listened and died ignominiously (Alfonzo Twine). Keystone of Lowery's condemnation was \\"there was no Christ in it\\" but this is severe lack of knowledge - Gregory himself had often published on the theme and believed the religion \\"was an expression of precisely 'the love that Christ taught' and the fulfillment of Christian eschatology, and \\"it would have been uncharacteristic of him not to have said so.\\" But instead of any version of this kind of presentation Lowery only warned that Gregory had malevolent intentions even though he had a \\"good, clear voice\\", was \\"really eloquent and forceful\\" but \\"shrewd enough to conceal his real purposes.\\" With the death of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√° in late 1921 and the designation of the Guardianship of Shoghi Effendi in the Spring of 1922 a remodeling and development of the administration of the religion began including an international pattern of electing national assemblies and increased communication even locally with the head of the religion. In 1923 he addressed the local group among with other small communities not yet able to elect a local assembly. Gregory stayed in Sumter in 1924 for twelves days and eight in Charleston (and ran into Chalence Westendorff who had found the religion himself and was often arrested for \\"preaching\\" on main street) \\\\- attended the funeral of his step-father in 1929 in Charleston which was handled by local NAACP founders the Mickey brothers. Klebs addressed the 1925 national convention saying \\"‚Ä¶ perhaps the best proof that the Cause has been spreading is that from various churches the Bah√° º√≠ movement has been denounced.\\" =More sustained than sporadic= In 1931 Gregory returned again and also a \\"team\\" of Chauncey Northern and Philip Marangella did a musical tour. They spoke to a \\"campus philosopher\\" Josiah Morse whom Gregory had met years ago and who may have been responsible for a quote in the student newspaper that \\"closely resembled Bah√° º√≠ teachings.\\" They also visited Allen University and Benedict College in Columbia and Claflin University and the Colored Normal Industrial Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina in Orangeburg. At the time isolated individuals or small groups were noted in Charleston, Columbia, Orangeburg and Sumter. Other individually traveling teachers of the religion include Lorol Schopflocher (1933) and Stanwood Cobb (1934) \\\\- Cobb stayed for seven talks across some of March and April, and a study group was established thereafter with two established Bah√° º√≠s among the group and they met at the only female physician's home in North Augusta, Marie Kershaw. William and Christine Bidwell, friends of Kershaw having recently moved to the area from Miami where they had joined to the religion, were among a total of about 17 with more or less identification with the religion and a year later elected their first local spiritual assembly (it bridged North August and Augusta.) Klebs was somewhat distant from the group but she was also having medical problems and members of the group tried to help her, as well as the Eliot assembly during her summer there in 1938. She died January 1939 in Augusta. The class studied a number of Bah√° º√≠ works between 1934 and 1938 - Bah√° ºu'll√°h and the New Era, a compilation of letters from Shoghi Effendi, Some Answered Questions and other collections of  ªAbdu'l-Bah√°'s writings and talks as well as The Dawn-Breakers. In late 1936 Dr. Zia Bagdadi and his family moved to Augusta, the first Persian Bah√° º√≠s to live in the area and the community counted some 30 members plus friends and about as many interested contacts. And with a couple African- Americans the community was also partially integrated despite frequent presentations in African-American establishments over the years, though it is also true larger integration could have drawn unwelcome attention. On the other hand there were no champions of integration insisting on that standard. Dr Bagdadi succeeded in making contacts among African-Americans, notably a doctor, as well as progressively larger and larger meetings at a home but these suddenly stopped with rumors the police and spoken to the family. However Bagdadi suddenly died April 1937. Slow Growth Increasingly from the 1930s Leroy Ioas, chair of the Bah√° º√≠ National Teaching Committee, emphasized \\"fireside\\" meetings in individual homes as a key way for individuals to help the religion as well as pioneers, or those who would voluntarily relocate for the advancement of the religion, instead of brief visits by speakers. At the same time Shoghi Effendi initiated steps in implementing the directives of the Tablets of the Divine Plan pushing the American community to diffuse from its few cities to embrace every state in the country as well as international goals starting in South America. The Gregory family moved to Haiti for three months and developed a substantial group of Bah√° º√≠s there. And the South became half the focus of the first set of plans for promulgating the religion in more cities starting in 1937. Additionally delegates for the national convention were re-designated to be porpotional to state populations rather simply which communities had assemblies so South Carolina began to hold statewide conventions to elect delegates. Developing multiple communities and national standards A series of movements began across South Carolina for Bah√° º√≠s: in 1937 Christine Bidwell and Marie Kershaw from North Augusta tried to foster a group in Aiken, in late 1936-7 two women - Amelie Bodmer and May Fisher - traveled the state in a trailer, in late 1937 Emogene Hoagg and Agnes O'Neill spent the winter in Charleston, and Louise Thompson moved there when they left and then Emogene Hoagg returned in 1939. Hoagg reconnected with Westendorff but while alittle familiar with the beliefs of the religion he didn't confine himself to its teachings and felt he got the right thing to believe by himself. However Hoagg made progress speaking to some groups through the support of her landlady. However Hoagg was asked to go to Cuba to work on bringing the religion there in the Fall of 1940. Louise Thompson and Emma Thompson moved to Charleston to try to keep development going. In late 1938, White women Maud Mickle (Mickle had previous traveled to Brazil with Leonora Holsapple-Armstrong) and Alta Wheeler moved to Columbia where they soon met White woman Louella Moore was friends with the North Augusta community and in early 1939 wrote to be enrolled officially. Their landlady, African-American Pearl Dixon, an AME minister's widow, also converted in 1939 and her daughter in early 1940. African-American Zenobia Dorsey spent the winter in Columbia assisting by being able to reach the Allen University and Benedict College middle-class neighborhoods. They also reached the Palmetto Leader, a Black newspaper, with stories about the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois - then the Columbia Record, a White paper, did similarly, and then The State reported \\"a celebration of Bah√° º√≠ New Year at the home of Mickle and Wheeler that drew visitors from Augusta and Charleston.\\" In the spring of 1938 William (a chiropractor) and Christine Bidwell moved from North Augusta to outside of Greenville and soon moved into town. Though all the communities had had partial success with gaining interest from African-Americans none had had to deal strongly with opposition in such matters and none of them had made a point of focusing on it as a priority. } A national policy among Bah√° º√≠s had started to form from work of Gregory meeting with Bah√° º√≠s at Fisk University in 1934, a spiritual assembly in Nashville was elected in 1935, and a regional conference was proposed in 1936 to include a visit from the National Assembly. The development encountered the question of a high-profile series of integrated meetings. Indeed, one of the hotel's hosting one of the six resulting meetings objected and the Bah√° º√≠s appeared to relent. W. E. B. DuBois noticed and initially was misinformed of the nature of the resolution to which then secretary of the national assembly Horace Holley responded that the facts were not as DuBois understood them and that it was the hotel that had relented at the last minute - however a policy had been stated that, short of out of control reactions, integrated meetings should be held but in the case of over-reactions segregated meetings could be held with a longer term goal of fully integrated ones theoretically. But in this case the situation was avoided by the change in judgement of the hotel. All of the shifting options became mute when in 1938 a final policy was voiced - published under the title Advent of Divine Justice by Shoghi Effendi with a frank and prolonged discussion of the problem of race prejudice underscoring the short- term requirement and long term goal of complete integration and freedom from racial prejudice. All meetings were to be integrated and individuals to seek to adjust their habits in the matter. In addition, a matter of policy began that in tie votes in elections minorities were to be automatically given approval of the position. One result was the formation of a Race Unity Committee in 1940 with Louis Gregory and Dorothy Beecher Baker, a White descendant of abolitionists. A situation in the Atlanta Bah√° º√≠ community was resolved with integration even to the point of letting White people leave the religion if they couldn't accept the standard. Correspondence among South Carolinian communities buzzed with the development. By the end of 1944, a centennial marker for the religion, groups of Bah√° º√≠s were noted in Greenville and Columbia in addition to North Augusta. At the national convention many Bah√° º√≠ from South Carolina had their first exposure to the wider Bah√° º√≠ community both regionally and internationally, both personally and in written summary, as well as a personal encounter with the Bah√° º√≠ House of Worship in Wilmette, Illinois - the object of decades of sacrifice of the national community. =Struggling in Greenville= The Greenville community had been set against increasing tensions and conflict in society with the Ku Klux Klan. NAACP chapters had been forced to close with economic and as well a violent actions. The Bidwell's, working through the Depression and administrative changes, had been partially lost track of - mistakes redressed in 1939. And the Augusta community also lost track of them. Consequently, the Bidwells and Greenville became a focus of attention in 1940 though most of the assistance came in the form of White women widowers, single, or while their husbands had been drafted in the war. Regardless, by late 1940 an assembly was elected but the population was unstable and soon dissolved. And though August-North Augusta communities initially had enough Bah√° º√≠s to independently elect assemblies following the new rule to follow civic boundaries for communities both soon lost assembly status. Consequently, in 1942 specific measured accounting of how many Bah√° º√≠s were needed in each location were tallied and specifically filled voluntarily but in coordination so that excess was avoided. In 1942 and 1943 conferences were held in Greenville to raise awareness among and beyond the Bah√° º√≠s and the assembly was elected again in 1943. On the assembly were one family were native Southerners and the only African-Americans of the community, but the only two local Bah√° º√≠s were not on the assembly, so the remaining seven were all \\"transplants\\", and the two Southerners were elected as two of the four officers and neither of the officers were African-Americans. Overall there were seven women and two men, one of whom was elected as chair. Meanwhile, at least one White influential Bah√° º√≠ was uncomfortable with integrated meetings - Emogene Hoagg - and there were reports the FBI was specifically checking on Bah√° º√≠s in Greenville who had more forcefully defied Jim Crow laws like Luda Dabrowski and Grace Wilder and social tensions were felt from the tone of traveling teachers of the religion as well as a young African-American woman, Eva Flack McAllister - all this seeming to lower interest from higher social class White people, despite the fact that Shoghi Effendi had continued to hold a standard that Black seekers of the religion should be welcomed equally to White and the White not be given privilege of being first, though not going against public law in arranging for meetings. In affect the caution may have avoided the attention prone to violence, it also dampened the practical outreach to African- Americans where other communities across the South succeeded in gaining converts from both White and Black. Additionally the community was \\"paralyzed\\" between the two men on the assembly, who, \\"loved each other like brothers, and they fought like brothers\\" in that Chair Bidwell was an alternative healer in non-mainstream ideas dictating meeting arrangements and Williams refusing to attend and asking to be placed in another goal city. By the Fall several Bah√° º√≠s left Greenville and the assembly was hamstrung without a quorum. Gregory came to South Carolina in the winter of 1944-5 and toured the Bah√° º√≠ communities though the Greenville community remained divided and unstable. =Post-War development= After the Bah√° º√≠ centenary of 1944, Shoghi Effendi designated another goal date of 1952-53 to mark the centenary of Bah√° ºu'll√°h's foundational experience which proceeded in time to form the Bah√° º√≠ Faith itself. The Second World War came with various instances of struggle in civil rights in the wider society both before and immediately after the war. The Civil Rights Movement in South Carolina largely expanded after the War, along with massive changes economically such as the primary crop changing from cotton to tobacco and politically such as the election J. Strom Thurmond. In particular to the civil rights of African-Americans, court cases began to proceed such as Briggs v. Elliott. For Bah√° º√≠s Shoghi Effendi framed the War and its antecedents and effects as an essential stage on welding humanity \\"into a single organism\\". See \\"The New Negro\\". The Bah√° º√≠s produced a documentary about this The Invisible Soldiers Unheard Voices Low. Bah√° º√≠s at the national level made a priority of reaching out to the battered countries of Europe and east Asia for the persecuted Bah√° º√≠ communities while continuing the work in South America and the Caribbean and added the initial phases of introducing the religion into Africa more systematically. This was culminated in the Ten Year Crusade that proceeded after the death of Shoghi Effendi though among his last letters he emphasized the work of race unity and reaching out the African-American community in the American South. A broad US national goal was to focus on communities near the population needed to form assemblies. A regional committee organizing North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia was established and made the three cities of South Carolina its goals for South Carolina. Bah√° º√≠s from across the region met in each other's cities and across state lines. Regional conferences and long weekend \\"schools\\" began to be hosted with at times a hundred participants including African- Americans. However Gregory and his wife's health declined and further trips to the South were ended and he spent more time contributing in the area of Green Acre, but he wrote letters to contacts of his including South Carolina. He died on July 30, 1951 and was named a Hand of the Cause, the highest personal position of the religion open to anyone, by Shoghi Effendi, posthumously, as was his practice at the time. Indeed, observances for his death were being held by new Bah√° º√≠s in Uganda. The Bah√° º√≠s of Columbia did indeed reach assembly status at first with a majority of local Black converts. Regular meetings of the community like the Nineteen Day Feast and observances of Bah√° º√≠ Holy Days and talks with returning pioneers and visitors were held even in \\"seekers\\" homes across the races and garnered some newspaper coverage. By 1950 the majority were Black Columbians, most with a decade of service in the religion. However, there were incidents where police were called when inter- racial meetings were held sometimes and one home was attacked by the KKK. By 1953 the community had dropped below assembly status again as pioneers moved out of the community and went to Washington D.C., Switzerland, and New Orleans. Eulalia Barrow Bobo, sister to Joe Louis, visited and gave a talked that much influenced attendees and through several discussions a family of Baptists converted. Then some among their friends converted. By 1962 they were electing an assembly for the county of Columbia as well as the city. The Greenville community struggled to form a pattern of activity for both Bah√° º√≠s and those interested in the religion. For public meetings the group experimented with both separate and mixed meetings - meetings in the Bidwell and Williams homes were separated by race noting the differences by address and times. In 1947 a group of Bah√° º√≠s including prominent former diplomat Ali- Kuli Khan met with then mayor J. Kenneth Cass to discuss holding integrated public meetings which turned out to be only possible at the city council chambers, which the Bah√° º√≠s then began to use and Khan spoke at the first meeting. Again there were travelers visiting but the overall membership declined down to four in 1952. However the community did gain further recognition from the city council that religious meetings didn't need to be segregated. And in 1956 gained an earnest young couple - Richard and Joy Benson - who moved to Greenville and overcame obstacles like blacklisted for work, and threatening calls at their home when it was clear they socially mingled with African-Americans. They, along with other pioneers, re-elected the assembly in 1957. The North Augusta community continued to function sometimes at assembly level. Development did, however, extend further across the State. Charleston had sporadic presence of Bah√° º√≠s along with other locations - Allendale, Bennettsville, Clemson, Orangeburg, Walterboro, and Union. The religion was also visible in Florence newspapers in 1946,* 1955, and 1956. The 1960s and 70s A regional long-weekend \\"Bah√° º√≠ school\\" was held in Frogmore in 1960 and the increased demand by then made it a twice-a- year event from 1960 to 1965. In 1961 seventy Bah√° º√≠s showed up for a school registered for 51 held at the Penn Center on Saint Helena Island. Eulalia Bobo was again asked to speak - this time to the islanders there in 1962 and with a pioneer the island elected its first assembly in 1963 and in 1964 it was entirely of African-American. This was against a backdrop of developing civil rights work like the NAACP Congress of Racial Equality chapters multiplying across South Carolina and the overall growth in the movement to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Harvey Gantt seeking entry at Clemson University. From 1959 the rate of people joining the religion statewide was clearly growing - 7 in 1959-60, then 15, then 36 in 1961-2. Music with Bah√° º√≠ themes began to be common in the region. A number of newspaper stories mention the religion in the early 1960s: * A professor from Lander University attended a talk by R√∫h√≠yyih Khanum and then on return gave her own talk later that year. * North Carolinian Bah√° º√≠s visited in Gaffney followed some years later with coverage of the fact that the religion was going to be profiled in an episode of Lamp Unto My Feet on television. * The Bah√° º√≠ Temple was noted in Greenwood. Florence had a successions of newspaper stories covering events in the community. A Bah√° º√≠ scholar stayed several days in Florence where some Chiropractor Bah√° º√≠s used advertising too,* * followed by ex-military Paul Pettit and public observances of Bah√° º√≠ Holy Days. Eventually more local people converted and the first assembly of Florence County was elected in 1962. Activity continued into 1963 when there is a profile of the Young family as chiropractors and an assistant, Mrs. Foxworth, known as a Bah√° º√≠.* * These Florence Bah√° º√≠s Jordan and Annette Young had come from Iowa and moved there in 1957 and developed a racially integrated working environment despite obstacles. In 1964 all its members were Black. In 1961 the Greenville assembly won the right to perform marriages and became incorporated in 1962. It then began to host inter-racial picnics and meetings with Human Rights Day and United Nations Day events proceeding from obscure venues in the late 1950s to premier ones by 1964. Similar to the opportunities in 1944 of international and nationwide gathering of Bah√° º√≠s, the first Bah√° º√≠ World Congress was attended by Bah√° º√≠s from South Carolina where again the scope of the community was more plain and invigorating to those that attended. \\"Seeing all these people from different ethnic and religious backgrounds, the beauty of these diverse people coming together for one purpose, I knew it could happen all over the world. It wasn't just in Greenville, South Carolina; this was a world community.‚Ä¶I already knew that, but at the World Congress I saw it.\\" This event saw the election of the Universal House of Justice, the new head of the religion since the death of Shoghi Effendi, for the first time. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith was mentioned in the April 1965 edition of Ebony Magazine with an article \\"BAH√Å'√ç: A way of life for millions\\"BAH√Å'√ç: A way of life for millions, Ebony, ISSN 0012-9011, Vol. 20, No. 6, April 1965, p. 48‚Äì52, 55-56. which was a broad review of the religion with many pictures and locations. It also generated seven appreciative letters from Bah√° º√≠s or Bah√° º√≠ institutions to the editor in the June 1965 issue.Letters to the editor; Baha'i, Ebony, ISSN 0012-9011, Vol. 20, No. 8, June 1965, p. 13‚Äì14. The photographer for the story, Lacey Crawford, and his wife, Ethel, converted to the religion and pioneered to Winnsboro, South Carolina, in 1968. From 1966 to 1969 several people joined the religion in Charleston including two from the North that had come down to strike with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and were jailed. After being released they went to a Bah√° º√≠ meeting and joined the religion. Statewide the population was between 100 and 150. Nationally the religion was growing too - from 1963 to 1968 it grew by 1/3rd to 18,000. There was a focus for Bah√° º√≠s moving to South Carolina to find small towns to move into. Soon the news was that not only were individuals joining the religion but whole families and social networks. Fast growth The growth of the religion in South Carolina was not a single process in a single place - it had various antecedents in various location - but it was an overall situation that applied in the State as well as elsewhere. One early aspect was a 1969 conference at Frogmore focused on the issues of mass-teaching and various target cities were named as well as others informally including Dillon. In March 1970 Bah√° º√≠s going to a conference at Beaufort in the far south of the state and another in April in Colombia. This conference was focused at educators and the profession of education aimed at observing the UN International Education Year of 1970. Speakers at the conference included Benjamin Payton, president of Benedict College and Daniel Jordan of the University of Massachusetts and other institutions including the Bah√° º√≠ National Spiritual Assembly. Participants included public school teachers from African American population centers and institutions. Another was that the Youngs from Florence helped another chiropractic couple, Roger and Sanndy Roff, set up their practice in Dillon and coordinated with another practice, Lee and Genelle in Columbia. The Youngs bought a revival tent capable of seating 250 people and hosted meetings around the state. In the Winter of 1969 the three families, in consultation with a regional committee, decided to host a meeting in Dillon and word spread for volunteers to come around Christmas/Winter vacations - around 200 people came at the peak of activity. It was a tremendous success at the time - Young recalled \\"one snowy day there were over a thousand new believers.\\" On the other hand, Bah√° º√≠s had been chased out of nearby Bishopville for two days. The third day a group went straight to the police station and talked to the chief of police for two hours on New Years Day 1970 until he gave the ok for them to be in town. In Dillon meetings of Bah√° º√≠s at the homes had eggs thrown at them. In 1971 Bah√° º√≠s returning from Dillon in and a contingent of fourteen Baha'is leaving the Dillon area in January, returning in April and into May. Another factor was that Alberta Williford, later known as Alberta Deas, was moving to South Carolina - she was chair of the Terre Haute community in Indiana in Spring 1969 and she decided to move to Adams Run, South Carolina, where she was born, in August. Shortly after moving there she began to hold meetings and regional conferences where one evening there were 10 simultaneous conversions to the religion and by the end of the weekend a total of 19 did in January 1970. Williford was credited in the Washington Afro-American in 1971 with initiating a conversion program in 1969. By January 1970 she had brought the Bah√° º√≠ message to 28 of her neighbors; largely through the efforts of these new converts 100 additional members had been recruited within six months. Williford lead a series of busses to the Bah√° º√≠ Temple in March 1971.* * The news in 1971 was that the national count of Bah√° º√≠s has doubled -* * The Christian Century noted that in a \\"one-month, 13-county 'teaching conference' based in Dillon, South Carolina, 9,000 converts, most of them black, joined the Baha'i faith, with hundreds more signing declaration cards in similar efforts throughout the south.\\" And it noted Williford's efforts too. The state with the single largest Bah√° º√≠ population was now South Carolina. In November pictures and a story cover the tents of activities set up around a chiropractor's house Bah√° º√≠s from across the nation are visible in a local newspaper and programs describing the teachings of the religion are more visible in February 1972 scattered across the State. Rumors of the intensity of the wave of conversions echo in Lumberton, North Carolina even in 1975 \\\\- meanwhile a statewide conference in South Carolina was held February 1973 and a public presentation of the Bah√° º√≠ New year, (Bah√° º√≠ Naw-R√∫z) was set in nearby Florence. The Bah√° º√≠ Faith at the University of South Carolina at Columbia was covered in the student newspaper The Gamecock. Digitization has been run from 1908 to 1988. There are about 45 pages that mention the religion (not including trivial repeats.) All but one are after 1967 but none of the articles mention the spread of the religion in South Carolina - there are a few larger profiles of the religion.* * =Analyses of conversion= In the estimation of Louis Venters in his Doctorate in History, the religion had reached a stage of being, on the one hand, ready for growth being imbedded in millennial expectations of Christianity and a \\"spiritualized polity\\" of well integrated peoples while on the other hand being numerically a restricted community unable to affect wide scale change or having had any significant period of expansion. Doctorate in Religion recipient Sandra Kahn notes the parallel between early Christians \\"going out to spread the 'good news' heedless of personal danger, and the early converts [to the Bah√° º√≠ Faith] taking the message to their hearts as fulfillment of their most cherished hopes.‚Ä¶ providing a glimpse into the actual scenario of the mass teaching/conversion experience which is so similar to early Christianity\\" even though \\"a significant number of Southern fundamentalist Christians who religion orientation is primarily 'other-worldly,' convert to a religion which denies the literal beliefs which they have always held, replacing them with sophisticated symbolic interpretations in a 'this-world' setting.\\" Reviewing a small selection of converts Kahn found \\"Concrete behavioral change take place. These are changes in habits such as fighting, drinking, \\"partying\\", cursing, gambling, gossiping, and promiscuous sexual behavior‚Ä¶. Family relationships become more stable. Racially mixed relationships and marriages occur. There is a tendency to increase one's education, nutritional habits and medical practices. And the convert finds ways to use his own talents to contribute to the religion and personally help others, as well as accepting help.\\" Finding additional parallels with a study of mass conversion in Buddhism she finds \\"Most of them are poor, illiterate, with centuries of oppression behind them\\" akin to the Untouchables of India, and represents a stage in escaping the system of oppression, using a popular understanding of the religion's ideas rather than an intellectual one. While many who were initially enthusiastic about conversion fell away, none in Kahn's study formally converted back to Christianity. She found the tendency to convert to the Baha'i Faith transcended other options for those she studied - on the one hand it filled a need for a kind of personal salvation over that of a \\"civil religion\\" in the American mythos of civil rights and its \\"sacred\\" documents like the Declaration of Independence, and on the other it was more appealing that the Civil Rights Movement with its charismatic preachers and ideals because it was less personal and more a \\"restatement of the old myth for the purpose of social action\\". She found that \\"the two (southern Christian experience and the Baha'i Faith) are compatible for a fruitful encounter. In a sense they are complementary. The Baha'i [faith] provides philosophical explanations, a broader world view, a sense of history, a sense of world unity, explanations of catastrophes and corruption, and in general gives a wider experience of purpose and meaning suitable to the new cultural environment of the South.\\" Venters continues that the religion succeeded in \\"Growing against all odds in a hostile environment, it had emerged as a coherent movement with branches in several cities and smaller towns and an unusually diverse body of members. More than any other religious group in the state, it embodied the ideal of the \\"beloved community\\" that Martin Luther King, Jr., articulated as the ultimate goal of the civil rights movement: the vision, rooted in Christian millennial expectation, of a spiritualized polity characterized by justice, love, and the \\"total interrelatedness\\" of all people.\\" The progress was worked \\"At the midpoint of the traumatic first year of mandatory statewide school desegregation in South Carolina, as disenchantment with the civil rights movement set in among many Blacks and Whites around the country and the competing rhetorics of Black power and White conservatism dominated the national political discourse, the teams of young Bah√° º√≠s taught that God had sent a new Messenger to unite the human race.\\" \\"Almost overnight, the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in South Carolina had gone from a tiny community in a handful of localities to a mass movement with members in every county. In 1970, there were eight Local Spiritual Assemblies in South Carolina; the next year, after the winter project, there were 108, more than any other state in the country. By the middle of 1972, some 20,000 people‚Äîmostly African Americans, but hundreds of Native Americans and European Americans as well‚Äîhad become Bah√° º√≠s in South Carolina.‚Ä¶ [with] fully one-third of the national community resided in South Carolina.\\" However \\"Their small numbers,\\" he continues, \\"severely limited the ability of the Bah√° º√≠s in South Carolina and elsewhere to promote the wholesale transformation of society anticipated in their sacred scriptures, and for which enlightened contemporary leaders like King were increasingly calling.\\" \\"Teachers on the ground in South Carolina, however, were already coming to terms with the difficulties of sustaining such rapid growth. Reinforced by a stream of home-front pioneers and traveling teachers‚Äîmany of them young adults and new Bah√° º√≠s themselves‚Äî they set about the difficult business of establishing Bah√° º√≠ community structures and practices in dozens of localities scattered across the state.\\" Dizzy Gillespie 200px John Birks \\"Dizzy\\" Gillespie was born October 21, 1917 in Cheraw, South Carolina and died January 6, 1993.Watrous, Peter Dizzy Gillespie, Who Sounded Some of Modern Jazz's Earliest Notes, Dies at 75, The New York Times Obituary, January 7, 1993 Dizzy was a Bah√° º√≠ since about 1970, was one of the most famous adherents of the religions which helped him make sense of his position in a succession of trumpeters as well as turning his life from knife-carrying roughneck to global citizen, and from alcohol to \\"soul force\\", in the words of author Nat Hentoff, who knew Gillespie for forty years. Gillespie's conversion was most affected by Bill Sear's book Thief in the Night. Gillespie spoke about the Bah√° º√≠ Faith frequently on his trips abroad.Groovin' High The Life of Dizzy Gillespie by Alyn Shipton.Groovin' High: The Life of Dizzy Gillespie Review by Brad Pokorny Louis Gregory Institute/WLGI Venter's thesis notes \\"In Georgetown County near Hemingway, a White couple, former Pentecostal ministers who had led most of their congregation into the faith, sold a large tract of family land to the National Spiritual Assembly to establish such a facility. Inaugurated in October 1972 and named for the South Carolina movement's most prominent native son, the Louis G. Gregory Bah√° º√≠ Institute became a hub of activity in the state and region ‚Ä¶\\" Come the fall of 1972 the national assembly dedicated the Louis Gregory Institute(LGI). Local Bah√° º√≠ Willard Brown died in November 1972 as well. Programs of delineating the religion continued in December 1972 and into 1973, and observed its decade anniversary in 1983. A campaign was established in the mid-1980s supported by the Continental Board of Counselors \\"‚Ä¶resulted in some 2500 new enrolments, the settlement of new home-front pioneers in several localities, and initial use of an innovative curriculum‚Äîdeveloped by Bah√° º√≠s in Colombia(the country in South America) and used increasingly throughout Latin America‚Äîfor training new believers as teachers. The number of Local Spiritual Assemblies in the state rose to some 275.\\" Following this and a fund-raising campaign the Louis Gregory Institute set up a radio station. The expertise of setting up Bah√° º√≠ radio stations in several Latin America in the later 1970s and 1980s was brought to help set up WLGI in Hemingway. Afterwards Dizzy Gillespie brought his band to play in the area in 1986. In the late 1980s Bah√° º√≠s in the state continued to hold initiatives for growth of the religion, and make the news occasionally beyond the particulars of LGI: * The Promise of World Peace being one case of an effort of the religion * participation at the second Bah√° º√≠ World Congress Modern Presence In the 1990s the Universal House of Justice, the current head of the religion, announced a decades-long effort to develop human resources and institutional capacity to sustain growth around the world. Youth activation, organization at a cluster level, training programs were initiated and expanded as resources and orientation became available. \\"By 2008 and 2009, membership growth in the country as a whole had returned to the level of the mid-1980s.\\" A nationwide county-by-county breakdown of Bah√° º√≠ populations ranks some counties in South Carolina as among the highest in the nation, (with a few in Georgia and South Dakota also notable): Marion at 10%, Williamsburg at 7.2%, and Dillon at about 6.3% in 2010, though the area of the county of Colleton where levels of activity had been high, were less than a third and closer to the statewide average. The fact that the Bah√° º√≠s formed the second largest percentage of the religious in the whole of South Carolina made the news in 2014 even convincing a skeptic - Mark Silk, and avowed atheist Herb Silverman, founding leader of Secular Coalition for America, took the opportunity from the news to check out the local Charleston Bah√° º√≠s - and was favorably disposed. Coverage by WMBF News in eastern South Carolina occurred in February 2016.* * And based on data from 2010, Bah√° º√≠s were the largest minority religion in 80 counties out of the 3143 counties in the country, including a few from South Carolina: Anderson, Horry, and Williamsburg. Bah√° º√≠s run a museum on Louis Gregory. Notable South Carolinian Bah√° º√≠s In addition to Louis Gregory and Dizzy Gillespie a number of South Carolinian Bah√° º√≠s have been in the news or otherwise been prominent: * Susan Aud√© is a retired American television news anchor in Columbia, South Carolina, who had worked her entire career from a wheel-chair. * Anisa Kintz made news as a child more than once, and won a Prudential Spirit of Community Award in 1996. Then Kintz was more broadly noted with a conference Calling All Colors, for which she was noted in React Magazine's \\"Take Action\\" awards in 1997, was profiled in an Odyssey Channel special also covering Dan Seals on the issue of racism, and won a Points of Light award. She earned a Discover Card silver \\"Tribute scholarship\\". * Jack E. McCants was from Texas and was an ex-minister who converted to the religion. He pioneered to Guam circa 1973, and moved to South Carolina to work as the director of Beckman Center for Mental Health Services in Greenwood. He served on the national assembly of the Bah√° º√≠s of the United States circa 2000, and been visible in local news as a Bah√° º√≠. * Ronald McNair was a physicist and NASA astronaut. McNair died during the launch of the Space Shuttle Challenger on mission STS-51-L. * Louis Venters of Francis Marion University who wrote a PhD on the religion in the state has won an award and has been consulted by media for the news of the religion in the State. * Muhiyidin Moye (1985 ‚Äì February 6, 2018) also known as Muhiyidin D'baha was a leading Black Lives Matter activist known nationally for crossing a yellow police tape line to snatch a Confederate battle flag from a demonstrator on live television in Charleston, South Carolina in .

Players control the titular character from a top-down perspective with the goal of escaping an eldritch art museum. The game has been credited with helping popularize its engine's use in developing games without role-playing elements.  Gameplay  The player moves a character through two-dimensional fields, interacting with and examining various objects. Obstacles come in the forms of blocked paths, which the player must somehow overcome and cross, and enemies and traps which deplete the player character's health. Once health reaches zero, the player loses. The player wins by seeing the narrative through to one of its ends. The game's English translator has said that the game is not demanding of the player's reflexes, although many enemies are fairly swift in movement.  Plot  A girl, Ib, is taken to Guertena Weiss' art museum by her mother and father. With her parents' permission, Ib wanders off on her own. She examines a painting she does not understand as the museum abruptly empties during a power outage, its doors locking before she can leave with the other guests. A series of paint splatters guide her into a different painting of the deep sea, which she physically enters. Trapped in an alien, painted world, Ib eventually finds and joins forces with two others: Garry, a soft-spoken young man dressed in tattered clothes who becomes protective and nurturing of Ib; and Mary, a mischievous, eccentric girl roughly Ib's age. Throughout their quest to escape the art gallery, Ib, Garry, and Mary encounter numerous puzzles, re-animated sculptures, and monstrous killer paintings. The game takes place at some point after the year 6235, as the numbers given with the paintings are years, as confirmed by the Japanese kanji for the games' script. The earliest date on Guertena's paintings is 6198 in \\"Marvelous Night\\"; the latest is The Geometrical Fish in 6235, and Mary was his last (her year being given as \\"????\\"). That's at least 37 years of Guertena painting, and at least 12 years with Mary (given \\"Juggling\\" in 6223).  Characters  ;Ib (Japanese „Ç§„É¥, romaji ibu) :A girl that is not quite an adult yet. Ib has long, straight brown hair and red eyes. One day, Ib becomes trapped in Weiss Guertena's art museum. :Kouri describes in his official blog posts that Ib is the heroine; \\"Red-themed. Her family is upper-class, so her skirt goes just down to her knees.\\" When showing the original first design of Ib, he notes, \\"the expression isn't quite right, but her clothes hardly changed.\\" He mentions Ib \\"loves her mother. Of course, she gets along with father too.\\" Initially, Kouri planned to have the menu image change for every petal the player lost of the rose. So Ib would look more ragged when she got down to 3 petals, but it \\"was too much of a hassle.\\" :Despite possible other translations for her name (such as \\"Eve\\") her name is officially written in English by Kouri as \\"Ib\\". That her name was officially meant to be \\"Eve\\" is a common misconception among fans, as Kouri has stated a clear preference for \\"Ib\\". ;Garry (Japanese „ÇÆ„É£„É™„Éº, romaji \\"Gyarƒ´\\") :A soft-spoken young man with lavender-like colored hair, dressed in tattered clothes who becomes protective and nurturing of Ib, as they try to escape the art gallery together (depending on players' choices). As the game progresses, Garry can go to extreme measures to protect Ib, even to the point of risking his life. :While Garry is often assumed to be an adult by fans, this is a common misconception - his official age nor birthday are never stated by creator Kouri or within the games' script. As well, instead of speaking with the dialect of a middle-aged Japanese man, he instead speaks using feminine pronouns and dialect (such as \\"onee\\", lit. \\"big sister\\"), similar to lavender linguistics. (For example, using the Japanese personal pronoun of \\"watashi\\", more commonly used by females, instead of \\"boku\\" or \\"ore\\", more commonly used by males.) Despite this, he also still refers to himself multiple times as a \\"man\\"; however, his use of such pronouns may associate him as a member of the LGBT community. Creator Kouri has also referred to him in blog posts and official art of Garry dressed in Japanese women's kimono as \\"Garry‚Äôs someone who'd like to cross the barriers of gender\\"; and has also mentioned regarding an official artwork of Garry as a witch, \\"Making Garry a witch, naturally, doesn‚Äôt feel off in the slightest.\\" As well, in the game, nothing is stated about his past or background prior to the game, other than Garry briefly mentioning near the start of the game he should have maybe worn better clothing to the art gallery. :In other blog posts as well as his art gallery, Kouri describes Garry's design as \\"stylish\\", stating \\"He‚Äôs got a stylish design\\" and describing him as \\"Ib's support\\". Kouri also mentions for Garry; \\"It was hard drawing distinctive expressions since he only shows one eye.\\" Kouri says he likes the idea of Garry's \\"coat fluttering around wherever he goes\\" and mentions, \\"I fiddled with the ruggedness of the coat over time... He has a tank-top underneath.\\" He mentions \\"Garry‚Äôs strange, but very easy to like.\\" He finishes the section on Garry with \\"His personality‚Äôs very feminine, too\\", again relating to and confirming Garry's feminine personality. A design of Garry with pink hair is shown; Kouri stating \\"Garry would have been nice with pink hair, but I scrapped it because he stood out more than the protagonist and it didn‚Äôt fit the mood at all.\\" :The Japanese spelling of his name could be romanized as \\"Gyarii\\", \\"Gerii\\" or \\"Garii\\"; however, it is officially written in English by Kouri as \\"Garry\\". ;Mary (Japanese „É°„Ç¢„É™„Éº, Romaji \\"Mearƒ´\\") :Dressed in a long green dress, with long blonde hair; a mischievous, eccentric girl who initially looks and acts roughly around Ib's age; noted to have an \\"innocent\\" personality. :It is later revealed to the player, however, also depending on players' choices, that the \\"antagonist\\" of the game is Mary. However, later \\"endings\\" would also reveal a backstory, possibly which influences her actions. :Mary's ultimate desire, as shown by the various initial endings; is to leave the \\"Fabricated World\\" and live as a human in the real world. :Later on, in additional \\"endings\\" released after the initial set of endings, Mary is revealed to be Weiss Guertena's \\"daughter\\", as a painting that he painted (a blog post on Kouri's website after the reveal also shows her happily holding out a yellow rose for \\"father\\".) A common misconception by fans is that Mary was his granddaughter. However, due to the years given on the paintings, Guertena's death prior to the games' start, and Ib's and Garry's own presumed ages; Mary may be mentally \\"developed\\" as an adult (or young adult), despite also retaining the aforementioned \\"innocent\\" personality (due to her being sheltered and apart from humans in the art gallery). :Kouri describes in his official blog posts that \\"She loves cute things\\", \\"Also playing. And delicious things.\\" He \\"had a lot of trouble settling on a color\\" for her dress, at one point also considering designs featuring the colors of white and blue; navy blue; and orange and black. Personally, Kouri liked the navy design \\"just as much. But it seemed too ocean-esque, so\\" he scrapped it. Kouri wished he could have made a few more \\"discussions\\" between her and Garry. ;Guertena Weiss (Japanese „ÉØ„Ç§„Ç∫ „Ç∞„É´„ÉÜ„Éä, romanji Waizu Gurutena) :The creator of the art gallery; noted initially by many to be a rather mysterious man. As the player progresses in the game, more small pieces of Guertena's history are revealed. :According to his Diary, Guertena believed that people can impart their spirit in the things they create; this including artwork. Guertena's goal was to immerse himself in his work in order to impart his spirit into his creations. :Later on, in additional \\"endings\\" released after the initial set of endings, Mary is revealed to be his \\"daughter\\", as a painting that he painted. :In his self portrait, Guertena wears a white long-sleeved shirt, and can be seen holding a paint brush in his left hand, which hints that Guertena might be left-handed. The picture that he is painting is the portrait of Mary. His face is never shown, leaving the rest of his appearance mysterious. He died prior to the game; of presumed natural causes. :'Weiss' in German also translates to \\"white.\\" ;Ib's Parents :Noted to be high-class, as Ib is from an upper-class family. They initially accompany Ib to the art gallery, but disappear along with everyone else when the lights first go out. :Ib's father, a young man, has dark brown hair, dark blue eyes, and pale skin. He wears a blue suit and a green tie. A polite, kind, and also sweet man like Garry; gentle in both words and appearance, he trusts Ib and seems to get along well with her, as portrayed in Kouri's old sketches. Noted to be very \\"intimidated\\" by art. Carefree; he also seems to forget things easily. He obviously loves Ib and, to his wife's disapproval, tends to buy her a lot of stuffed bunny plush dolls, including one which he gave her on her 9th birthday prior to the game's start. He and his wife also appear portrayed together in a portrait in the Fabricated World (\\"Couple\\"). He is mentioned very infrequently, and much less so than his wife, thus, his role has little significance. Neither he nor his wife speak with the dialects older Japanese middle-aged people would use; also making it very unlikely Garry is older than them, as Garry does not, either (and, neither does Mary). :Ib's mother is a young woman, with long, well-kept dark brown hair that is tied up in a fancy and fashionable-looking ponytail, red eyes, and pale skin. She wears a red dress with sleeves, and with a red gem on her neck collar. She acts loving and caring towards her daughter, and very much overall like a \\"mother\\", and seemingly does not want to spoil Ib much, as she disapproved of Ib's father giving Ib a lot of stuffed bunny plush dolls for her birthday or otherwise (and because Ib had many already). She lets Ib wander off on her own to explore the art gallery at the start of the game, but also expects Ib to behave. Ib shortly (as always) tells Mary at one point that her mother becomes \\"angry\\" sometimes, during which she \\"isn't nice\\", likely because of such disciplining of her daughter. However, she also trusts Ib to be responsible, especially where Ib's handkerchief is concerned (the handkerchief item of which also playing a significant role in the best \\"good ending\\", among other variations, likely due in part to her telling Ib to be responsible). She warns Ib to stay away from strangers, which foreshadows later endings of the game. :In some said \\"bad endings\\", among others, a \\"Fake Mother\\" appears, trying to deceive Ib using the tactic of also telling Ib to stay away from strangers (in many cases, Garry is also there). If Ib chooses to go with the \\"Fake Mother\\", the player will receive \\"bad ending\\"s of \\"Ib All Alone\\". :If Ib escapes the Fabricated World, Ib's mother can be found looking at paintings in the art gallery, and in some versions of the endings tells Ib that it is time to leave. ;The Lady in Red :Variations of her in the game include \\"The Lady in Blue\\", \\"The Lady in Green\\", and \\"The Lady in Yellow\\". :One of the paintings in the art gallery that temporarily acts as a \\"character\\", coming to \\"life\\" to chase the player and friends around. :Despite what a man in the gallery theorizes, Guertena himself denies that it depicts an actual person. A book in the art gallery also states how \\"the women here\\" have a fondness for flower fortune-telling, which may include the Ladies. :On an official artwork of her from Kouri's art gallery, Kouri noted, \\"At first you‚Äôd be certain she was a beautiful and elegant lady... but...\\" Kouri also mentioned in a Halloween-themed blog post on his official site that she \\"has developed a fondness for chocolate\\", portraying her eating a pumpkin-shaped lollipop while music notes surround her (likely implying her humming). He then went on to comment; \\"Girls like sweets, huh.\\"  Reception  Ib has gained a cult following in the horror indie game field. It has received praise for its atmosphere and general design, and has garnered comparisons to Yume Nikki. By the start of 2014, Kouri mentioned on his website that Ib broke 1,150,000 downloads in Japan. There was a similar \\"high\\" number of downloads on the English side. Ib also received some official merchandise, such as mini 3D figurines sold at Animate shops around Japan in early 2014; a 2013 calendar sold at Comiket 83; mascot plush dolls of Ib, Garry, and Mary sold as arcade prizes around late January 2013 at Taito Station; and a tote bag and a wine glass sold at \\"Guertena Shop\\".

The district covers 18 acres (7 ha) and portions of 6 blocks in Dothan's historic commercial district. At the time of the nomination, it contained 68 contributing properties, however many have been demolished in the intervening years. Dothan was founded on the site of Poplar Head Springs, which was an important crossroads in the Muscogee lands. Logging was the area's first major industry, but did not develop until after the Civil War. Settlers began building saw mills and blacksmith shops, and encouraged commercial development by donating land and bricks to new settlers. The town was incorporated in 1885, and began a period of great expansion with the coming of the Alabama Midland Railway in 1889. The oldest buildings in the district date from the 1900s, including the three-story Wadlington Hotel (built 1900, demolished 2012) and the Neoclassical First National Bank (1907). Several brick warehouses were also constructed along the railroad line. A symbol of the town's rapid growth, a five-story office building was completed in 1914. Cotton had replaced lumber as the economic engine of the region, but the boll weevil outbreak of the 1910s sent Dothan into a recession. Fewer buildings date from beyond this period, including the Malone Motor Company Building (1923) and the Kress Building (1928). The importance of the downtown core declined after the 1960s, as retail establishments relocated to outlying areas.

The film is a documentary about musician Leon Russell, produced and financed largely by Russell and his then-business partner Denny Cordell. Blank spent a large portion of two years on the film, but then its release was delayed for 40 years due to creative differences and music clearance problems. Blank's son, Harrod Blank (who was a child when the movie was filmed), spent years working on the clearances before it was shown publicly in 2015.Daniel Eagan, \\"Back Home: Les Blank's A Poem Is a Naked Person\\", Film Comment, March 16, 2015. Production Blank and his assistant Maureen Gosling spent extensive time with Russell at his recording studio on Grand Lake in Oklahoma. Blank shot many hours of footage for the film, including the expected concerts, rehearsals, and interviews, but also atmospheric material intended to capture the mood and surroundings, later described by Harrod Blank as \\"what he [Les] was attracted to: lake footage, sunsets, beautiful women, eccentric characters, Oklahoma folk.\\" A portion of the film depicted underground artist Jim Franklin painting a mural in Russell's empty swimming pool. The result was a non-traditional film, and its fate became uncertain after Russell and Cordell terminated their business relationship in 1976.Jerry Wofford, \\"Leon Russell documentary 'A Poem is a Naked Person' makes debut at South by Southwest festival\\", Tulsa World, March 23, 2015. For many years, A Poem Is a Naked Person was shown only at special screenings with Les Blank in attendance.Lars Nilsen, \\"Counterculture Time Capsule: Forty years later, Les Blank's Leon Russell rock doc sees the light of day\\", Austin Chronicle, March 13, 2015.Jonathan Marlow, \\"The Art of Filmmaking: Les Blank\\", Fandor, December 2, 2014. In 2011, Russell told Billboard that he didn't like the film and didn't intend to release it.Phil Gallo, \\"Leon Russell Hits the Road After 'Union' Success\\", Billboard, April 11, 2011. Also in 2011, when the International Documentary Association honored Blank with a career achievement award, the film was described as \\"perhaps the greatest film about rock 'n' roll and American music that you will likely never see\\".Taylor Segrest, \\"2011 Career Achievement Award--Visionary Wayfarer: Les Blank\\", Documentary Magazine, Winter 2012. The film received its public premiere (with Russell in the audience) in March 2015 at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, then had theatrical and DVD releases. The movie was released on DVD and Blu-ray by The Criterion Collection on March 29, 2016. Reception In 1979, Robert Christgau wrote a lengthy article about Les Blank that for the most part praised Blank's work in his food-oriented documentaries, but included sharp criticisms of this film. Christgau derided it as an \\"arty horror movie of a documentary\\" that \\"abandons subtlety for an overstated visual gadgetry that screams repulsion out of control.\\"Robert Christgau, \\"Music, Food & the Idea of the 'Folk': Contra Les Blank\\", The Village Voice, November 19, 1979. When the film was released, however, critical reception was positive. Writing for Film Comment, Daniel Eagan noted the \\"extraordinary concert footage\\" of \\"intimate, sweaty, incantatory music shaped for the moment at hand\\" as well as studio footage with \\"a different sense of intimacy, of polished professionals displaying casual, almost effortless expertise.\\" Carson Lund of Slant Magazine praised it as \\"a free-floating portrait of the eccentric neo-Gospel Oklahoman frying pan that is Russell's mini-universe\\".Carson Lund, \\"SXSW 2015: The Boy, 6 Years, & A Poem Is a Naked Person\\", Slant Magazine, March 17, 2015.

The translucent pink shrimp derives its name from ', the Japanese word for the cherry blossom. The species grows to about 4‚Äì5cm and lives primarily in Suruga Bay in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, where it is caught to be eaten. It is also caught in Taiwan. Taxonomy The species name of the sakura shrimp has not been settled. The International Code of Zoological Nomenclature uses the designation Sergia kishinouyei that Nakazawa and Terao gave it in 1915. Researchers tend to use the Sergia lucens, which Danish zoologist Hans Jacob Hansen gave it in 1922, especially since Isabella Gordon published a detailed account of the species in On New Or Imperfectly Known Species of Crustacea Macrura in 1935 using Hansen's designation. Hansen's designation comes from the genus Sergia and the Latin lucentis (\\"lighting\\"), likely referring to the sakura shrimp's phosphorescent photophores, which do emit light under certain conditions. The name of the shrimp comes from its colour resembling the sakura cherry blossom. The Japanese name sakura ebi () translates as \\"cherry blossom shrimp\\"; it is so named because of the pink colour of the dried shrimp. Description The sakura shrimp has a lifespan of about 15 months, matures a year after hatching, and dies off 2 or 3 months after spawning.: \\"The adult shrimp gradually die after laying eggs, so the [mature] shrimp nearly disappear by December Ë¶™„Ç®„Éì„ÅØÁî£ÂçµÂæåÂæê„ÄÖ„Å´Ê≠ª„Å¨„ÅÆ„Åß12Êúà„Å´„ÅØ„Åª„Å®„Çì„Å©Âßø„ÇíÊ∂à[„Åô]\\" The adult can grow to 4‚Äì5cm and 0.4g. The body is neartranslucent, but red pigments are present all over the body, so that live specimens appear to be pink (sakura-iro) in color, and this is believed to be the reason the shrimp obtained its Japanese name.: \\"The name sakura in sakura ebi seems to derives from the fact that it has red pigments and 161 photophores scattered across its near-transparent body, causing it the catch to appear cherry-blossom pink (sakura-iro) at a distance „Çµ„ÇØ„É©„Ç®„Éì„ÅÆ„Çµ„ÇØ„É©„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜÂêç„ÅØ„ÄÅ„Åù„ÅÆÈÄèÊòé„Å´Ëøë„ÅÑ‰Ωì„Å´Ëµ§„ÅÑËâ≤Á¥†„Å®161ÂÄã„ÅÆÁô∫ÂÖâÂô®„ÅåÊï£Âú®„Åô„Çã„Åü„ÇÅ„Å´„ÄÅÈÅ†„Åè„Åã„Çâ„ÅØÊºÅÁç≤Áâ©„Åå„Çµ„ÇØ„É©Ëâ≤„Å´„Åø„Åà„Çã„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜ„Å®„Åì„Çç„Åã„Çâ„Åç„Åü„ÇÇ„ÅÆ„Å®ÊÄù„Çè„Çå„Çã.\\" These pigments are concentrated in the lateral carapace, around the mouth and mouth appendage, and the tail (uropod and telson). Most members of Sergestes normally emit light, but for a long time, the sakura shrimp had not been observed to luminesce, despite having photophores., citing However bioluminescence has been confirmed under laboratory conditions using strobe light or eyestalk-crushing as stimulus. The photophores, which appear as red spots, range in number from 158 to 169 in adults; it numbers fewer in immature specimens and increases as the individual grows. Three pairs of head appendages are present: the second pair (the antennae) are the longest, and the third (mandible) the shortest. The first set of appendages (antennules) are quite short also, even shorter than the rostrum that are less than half the length of eye stalks. As for thoractic appendages, there are five pairs of pereiopods present, the second and third pair being chelate, or pincer-ended, as is generally is the case for this entire genus. The fourth and the much shorter fifth pereiopods are flat and consist of 6-segmented, this also being a genus-wide trait.  Distribution  The pelagic Sakura shrimp live in coastal areas, primarily in Suruga Bay in Shizuoka Prefecture, where they form in dense aggregations. Suruga measures about 60km long and 54km at its greatest width; at a depth of 2400m, and with almost no continental shelf, it is the deepest and steepest of Japan's bays. Sakura shrimp remain in depths from 210 to 360m during the daytime. Sakura shrimp are also found in nearby Sagami and Tokyo Bays, but are not caught there as the populations are too sparse, perhaps because of insufficient depths of the bays. In Taiwan the sakura shrimp is found in the coastal waters of Donggang and on the east coast. Findings have also been recorded in Borneo and New Guinea.  Behaviour  Rather than crawling on the ocean floor as with other species of shrimp, the sakura shrimp spends its life floating in the water. During the day sakura shrimp scatter at a depth of 200‚Äì300m; toward dusk they aggregate at a depth of about 60m. Until maturity the ratio of males to females is about equal. Upon reaching maturity males and females separate into groups, and as the females tend to group near the surface close to shore, the sex ratio changes around May to July. =Spawning= Spawning occurs between late May and early November, but primarily in July and August when surface water temperatures are above 20 ¬∞C. The ovaries stretch below the heart from the gastric region to the end of the back. As they mature they grow and change colour from yellow to milky blue and finally bluish-green at the time of spawning. The Sakura shrimp spawns an average of 1700‚Äì2300 eggs overnight far out in the bays. Distribution concentrates at a depth of about 20‚Äì50m. The eggs average 2.6mm in circumference. The eggs are not sticky, and with density similar to seawater they remain wafting, typically near the spot they were spawned, spending the course of their life as plankton. Harvest and consumption The Suruga fishery was established in 1894. During the two fishing periods of March to June and October to December the sakura shrimp are caught by trawling at night. Annual yields of sakura shrimp average tons in Suruga Bay and 100 tons in Donggang. In Japan during the summer spawning months Sakura shrimp harvests are prohibited for conservation reasons.

It is approximately long and flows through Pittston Township and Dupont. The watershed of the creek has an area of . The creek has no named tributaries, but several drainage ditches flow into it. It is a Coldwater Fishery and is not impaired. The creek is one source of flooding in Pittston Township. Course Collins Creek begins near the base of a hill in Pittston Township. It flows north for a short distance before turning northwest for several tenths of a mile. It then turns west before turning southwest and then west again. Several tenths of a mile further downstream, the creek enters Dupont and turns southwest for a few tenths of a mile, reentering Pittston Township. It then turns west-southwest for several tenths of a mile before reaching its confluence with Mill Creek. Collins Creek joins Mill Creek upstream of its mouth. Tributaries Collins Creek has no named tributaries. However, a number of drainage ditches lead into the creek. Hydrology Collins Creek is not considered to be impaired. Pittston Township and the borough of Dupont have permits to discharge stormwater into the creek. The peak annual discharge of Collins Creek at its mouth has a 10 percent chance of reaching 230 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 390 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 470 cubic feet per second. It has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 680 cubic feet per second. The peak annual discharge of Collins Creek at the border between Pittston Township and Dupont has a 10 percent chance of reaching 200 cubic feet per second. It has a 2 percent chance of reaching 340 cubic feet per second and a 1 percent chance of reaching 400 cubic feet per second. It has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching 580 cubic feet per second. The discharge of Collins Creek was measured several times in the middle of the 20th century. The values ranged from 0.10 to 3.70 cubic feet per second. Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Collins Creek is above sea level. The elevation near the creek's source is between above sea level. The headwaters of Collins Creek are on a ridge near the Wilkes-Barre Scranton International Airport. It also passes by the International Trade Zone Industrial Park and loses water to a mine pool, as does the nearby Lidy Creek. Watershed and biology The watershed of Collins Creek has an area of . The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Avoca. The creek is one of the main tributaries of Mill Creek. Its watershed is \\"high quality\\" and mountainous (as is the case with Collins Creek). According to the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan, the creek's location on United States Geological Survey quadrangle maps is erroneous. Collins Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery. There is a stream site operated by the United States Geological Survey on the creek in Dupont. Collins Creek is a source of flooding in Pittston Township. History Collins Creek was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1172217. A storm in 1955 caused high waters on Collins Creek. However, there was little flooding in Pittston Township during that storm. In 1990, a tanker truck spilled 8000 gallons of gasoline in the area, causing emergency operations to be performed in the watershed of the creek. In 2002, the replacement of a bridge carrying Interstate 81 over the creek in Dupont was authorized for $1,100,000.

He wrote several collections of stories and contributed to various journals, including Welsh Outlook, throughout his career. In 1940 he won the Literature Medal for his story, \\"Sgweier Hafila\\", at the National Eisteddfod. His pen name was generally abbreviated to \\"T. Hughes Jones\\". His name is inscribed on the memorial to the poets of Mynydd Bach. Early life Jones was born in Blaenpennal to Rhys Jones and Ann Hughes along with his younger sister, Jane. His mother died when he was six and his father subsequently moved the family to Blaen Aeron Farm. A local poet, John Rowlands, lived at the neighbouring farm and began to teach young Tom cynghanedd, a traditional form of Welsh poetry. Together they entered local eisteddfodau where Jones' work - in recitation and composition - was generally successful. Jones studied at the local school, Ysgol Tanygarreg, and became noted for his academic achievements and his ready answers. At a suggestion from the headmaster, his father moved him to the county school in Tregaron, where he became known as 'Tom Bardd' ('Poet Tom'). He soon after won his first chair at the Llanddewi Brefi eisteddfod in 1913 at the age of 17. He later won three additional chairs at eisteddfodau in Tregaron, Ysbyty Ystwyth and Rhydcymerau before he was 25 years of age. University Jones attended University College of Wales, Aberystwyth in 1913 and matriculated in 1916 with second-class honours in Welsh. He continued writing during his time at university, contributing frequently to Y Wawr, which he also edited in 1915-16, and later to The Dragon - both university periodicals. His studies were interrupted by the war in 1916, when he served in France with the Welsh Guards, but he resumed his studies upon his return and finished an M.A. in 1922. His thesis is entitled, 'Social life in Wales in the eighteenth century as illustrated in its popular literature of the period'. Work Jones continued to write throughout his career and his reflections on the First World War are considered an important part of the reaction at the time from Welsh speakers. National Eisteddfod, 1940 Jones won the medal for literature for his \\"long short-story\\" entitled \\"Sgweier Hafila\\" in the 1940 National Eisteddfod, also known as the Radio Eisteddfod since it was held remotely due to safety concerns during war-time Britain. The Prose Medal was awarded in the form of a Literature Medal for the best literary work, as opposed to the genre-specific prize in years past. Kate Roberts, who adjudicated the competition, awarded the prize to Jones and praised the manner in which his story presents an allegory for all who yearn for something better and succumb to lunacy when they cannot have it. Gildas Tibbot, as part of his preface in Atgof a Stor√Øau Eraill, praised Jones for his introduction of the \\"long short-story\\" into Welsh-language literature, a genre later explored by Roberts herself.

The genus currently contains a single species, the Aptian C. disjunctus. History and classification Cretomerobius disjunctus is known from the holotype specimen found in the Aptian age Bon‚ÄìTsagan site, one of the richest insect fossil locations in Mongolia. Bon Tsagan preserves lacustrian sediments of a mountain lake. The genus and type species were first described by Alexandr G. Ponomarenko in a 1992 paper on the fossil Neuroptera faunas of Mongolia, who named the species C. \\"distinctus\\", and which was later amended to C. disjunctus as a lapsus calami. The second species originally assigned to the genus, C. wehri, was described from a single mostly complete forewing which was preserved as a compression-impression fossil preserved in shale. The fossil was recovered from outcrops of the Ypresian Klondike Mountain Formation in the Republic, Washington area by Wesley Wehr in 1993. The type specimen is currently preserved in the Department of Paleobiology collections housed at Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, located in Seattle, Washington, USA. W. wehri was first studied by Vladimir Makarkin of the Far Eastern Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, S. Bruce Archibald from Simon Fraser University and John D Oswald of Texas A&M; University. Their 2003 type description of the new species was published in the journal The Canadian Entomologist. Makarkin et al coined the specific epithet wehri in honor of Wesley Wehr for his work on the paleontology of the Republic site. Subsequently, Makarkin, Wedmann & Weiterschan (2016) transferred C. wehri to the genus Proneuronema. At the time of the species description, placement of Cretomerobius within Hemerobiidae was uncertain. The overall venation of the wings did exclude the genus from a majority of the currently defined subfamilies; specifically Adelphohemerobiinae, Berothimerobiinae, Carobiinae, Notiobiellinae, Sympherobiinae, Psychobiellinae, Hemerobiinae, and Microminae. Makarkin et al suggested the possibility that Cretomerobius is an early offshoot genus. It would be near the start of the subfamily group consisting of Drepanacrinae, Megalominae, and Drepanepteryginae; but until more specimens are found and described, the placement could not be resolved. Description In general, wings of Cretomerobius show a distinct forking group of the Radial vein into three branches: ORB1, ORB2, and ORB3. The ORB1 vein has a number of pectinate branches which split from the ORB1 vein and angle to the apical area of the wing. Additionally the cubital-proximal, or CuP vein, forms a deep fork and the median vein forks proximally. The forewing of C. wehri is missing portions of the apical margin and small sections from along the fore and hind margins. The wing is estimated to have been by at its widest. The two species are distinguished by two characters. Notably, the geographic and temporal distance between the two fossils suggests they are separate species. Additionally to the temporal disjunction, the wings differ in the fusing of the Radial and Subcostal veins. The two veins in C. disjunctus fuse near the apex of the wing forming a single vein before the wing edge. However, in C. wehri, the two veins do not fuse and stay separate the whole length of the wing.

It has been published in various ways, including within Emma Goldman‚Äôs Anarchism and Other Essays (1910), published by Mother Earth,Published within Emma Goldman‚Äôs Anarchism and Other Essays. Second Revised Edition. New York & London: Mother Earth Publishing Association, 1911. pp. 183-200, as noted here and as the named, leading essay of a collection of Emma Goldman essays: The Traffic in Women, and Other Essays on Feminism (1970, Times Change Press, 1971 paperback). Mother Earth was a monthly anarchist magazine founded by Goldman, Max Baginski, and others in 1906. (introduction to a republishing of 1911 Anarchism and Other Essays) The essay is one of more than 20 articles that Goldman wrote during 1906 to 1940. Content The essay was written in response to the actions of contemporary social reformers campaigning against white slavery, whose legislative campaign Goldman claimed would only serve to create \\"fat political jobs\\" for \\"parasites.\\" In the essay she argues that the major cause of white slavery, that has been ignored by these reformers, is capitalist exploitation. Goldman criticizes the role which Christian churches have played in historically encouraging and maintaining prostitution. Goldman presents marriage as on the same continuum as prostitution, arguing that in both cases women are sold and circulated, and is critical of \\"moralists\\" who condemn prostitution, but not marriage for monetary considerations. Goldman claims that double standards surrounding male and female sexuality pressure women who engage in sexual activity outside marriage into a life of prostitution, thereby \\"society creates the victims that it afterwards vainly attempts to get rid of.\\" Reception and legacy American radical feminist writer Alix Kates Shulman strongly endorsed the essay, reading the entirety of it into the record of a legislative hearing on prostitution in New York. She argues that Goldman's sympathy for prostitutes was due to identifying with them, \\"because of their class and because they defied the sexual hypocrisy of Puritanism.\\" The essay served as an inspiration for anthropologist Gayle Rubin's 1975 essay \\"The Traffic in Women: Notes on the 'Political Economy' of Sex.\\" While Rubin follows Goldman in arguing that prostitution is part of the same spectrum as marriage, she also builds off of the ideas of Claude Levi- Strauss and Sigmund Freud, to describe a \\"sex/gender system\\" through which such transactions can occur.

It is located a few miles northwest of the main part of Savannah. It is a road that links US 80/SR 17/SR 26 in Bloomingdale with SR 21 Alt. in Port Wentworth. It also has an interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95). It was named after Jimmy DeLoach, former mayor of Garden City and Chatham County commissioner for District 7. The parkway is planned to be extended along part of Bloomingdale Road to I-16 and have a concurrency with SR 17 for the entire length of the extension. SR 17's former path is planned to become SR 17 Spur. It is planned to be designated as SR 1251 until it opens. Construction began in 2018. Route description The parkway starts at an at-grade intersection with US 80/SR 17/SR 26 in the central part of Bloomingdale. The highway then heads to the northeast, and then curves to the north-northeast. It makes a gradual curve to the east-northeast. Just west of Towler Road, it begins a curve to the northeast and then leaves Bloomingdale and enters the northern part of Pooler. After curving back to the east-northeast, the parkway leaves Pooler just east of an intersection with the southern terminus of Triple B Trail and enters the far northwestern part of Savannah. It curves to the northeast and then to the southeast just before an interchange with exit 106 on Interstate 95 (I-95). The parkway then begins a curve back to the east-northeast just before an intersection with Crossroads Parkway. It travels on a bridge over some railroad tracks of Norfolk Southern Railway and then on another bridge over some railroad tracks of CSX. Just east of an intersection with the northern terminus of Portside Court and the southern terminus of Logistics Way, the parkway curves to the southeast. A short distance later, it curves back to the east-northeast. On the Savannah‚ÄìPort Wentworth line, it travels on a bridge over some railroad tracks of CSX and SR 21/SR 30\\\\. The parkway then enters Port Wentworth proper and has an interchange with SR 21 Alternate (SR 21 Alt.; Sonny Dixon Interchange / Jimmy DeLoach Connector). Here, the parkway's mainline ends, and the roadway continues as the connector. History Between the beginning of 1986 and the beginning of 1990, the roadway that would eventually become part of the parkway was established as Godley Road between US 80/SR 26 in the northern part of Bloomingdale to SR 21/SR 30 in the central part of Port Wentworth. By the beginning of 1993, a revamping of this road was proposed from SR 17 in the southwestern part of Bloomingdale to SR 21/SR 30 just north of its eastern terminus. However, by the beginning of 1997, this plan was canceled. In 2017, it was planned to extended Jimmy DeLoach Parkway from its current southern terminus at US 80/SR 17/SR 26, partially along the path of Bloomingdale Road (from SR 17's current southern terminus at I-16 to just south of its intersection with the northern terminus of Pine Barren Road). Construction on the extension began in 2018. Namesake James \\"Jimmy\\" DeLoach was a Democrat. He served three terms as Mayor of Garden City from 1973 to 1979. In 1980, he was elected to a four-year term as Chatham County commissioner for District 7. He was re-elected in 1984 and 1988. He did not run for re-election in 1992. His son Eddie, who is a Republican, succeeded him; and went on to become the 66th Mayor of Savannah. Future The at-grade intersection at Jimmy DeLoach Parkway's current western terminus is to be converted into a full diamond interchange. The extension of the parkway is planned to be designated as SR 1251 until it is opened. The former alignment of SR 17 is planned to be redesignated as SR 17 Spur. Also, the eastern end of Osteen Road, which lies on the right-of-way of the extension, is to be shifted to the west.

He served in the cabinet of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi as defence minister. In the Yemen Army, he holds the rank of major general. He was appointed to head the Ministry of Defence by Prime Minister Khaled Bahah in November 2014. Biography al-Subaihi was born in 1948 in Huwaireb, Al Madaribah Wa Al Arah District, Lahij Governorate. He had a bachelor's degree in military science from the military academy in Aden in 1976, then he studied Master's in the Soviet Union from 1978 to 1982. Later on, he fought along with Ali Salem al Beidh during the 1994 Yemeni Civil War. al-Subaihi was placed under house arrest by the Houthis in January 2015, during their coup d'√©tat in Sana'a. He resigned on 22 January, but after the Houthis' \\"constitutional declaration\\" on 6 February, in which they dissolved parliament and officially took control of the government, he was appointed to head the Houthi government's Supreme Security Committee. He attended the announcement of the constitutional declaration in Sana'a. On 7 March, however, he fled Sana'a and traveled to Lahij Governorate, eventually joining President Hadi in Aden. Jalal al- Rowaishan was appointed to succeed him as chairman of the Houthi-appointed Supreme Security Committee. Forces commanded by al-Subaihi participated in the Battle of Aden Airport on 19 March 2015, repelling special units loyal to former president Ali Abdullah Saleh from Aden International Airport and capturing an adjacent military base. They also fought against a Houthi military advance through the Lahij Governorate, where al-Subaihi was reportedly captured on 25 March 2015 in Al Houtah. Reuters cited Houthi and tribal sources reporting that he was released on 22 April, amid the start of Operation Restoring Hope. In October 2018, Oman reported that it convinced the Houthis to allow al-Subaihi to contact his family for the first time in three years.

Hastily formed in the winter in Catalonia shortly before the end of the war and marred by desertions,Pedro Corral, Desertores, Eds. de Bolsillo, San Sebasti√°n, 1966, p. 609 it was one of the last mixed brigades to be established. History Rushed formation of the brigade The decision to establish the 242nd Mixed Brigade was taken towards the end of 1938 in Vic, Catalonia, shortly before the onset of the rebel faction's devastating Catalonia Offensive.Carlos Engel (1999); Historia de las Brigadas Mixtas del Ej√©rcito Popular de la Rep√∫blica, p. 227 During the period of the instruction of the recruits the commanding officer was Militia Major Lucio Dom√©nech Mart√≠nez, following which the 242nd Mixed Brigade was hastily sent to the front and the command of the unit went to Militia Major Julio Mar√≠n Serrano. In the face of the atmosphere of panic and demoralization that preceded the relentless advance of the Francoist armies towards the heart of Catalonia, the constitution of this brigade was fraught with difficulties, mainly because of the high number of fugitives among the young men that had been conscripted. Like in all of the mixed brigades of the last period of the Spanish republic, the officers were drafted from the reserve. Failure followed by extinction The 242nd Mixed Brigade was sent to the frontline in January 1939 around the time of the Fall of Barcelona on 27 January 1939. Together with the 77th Division ‚Äîanother ill-prepared and hastily established unit‚Äî the brigade tried to establish a defensive line along the lower course of the Tordera River in order to halt the powerful advance of the enemy. But practically all other Republican Army units were rushing north towards the French border and the young and inexperienced 242nd Mixed Brigade was not prepared to fight the massive rebel offensive. Thus the eleventh hour resistance effort ended in disaster. On 1 February the brigade was overrun; it quickly lost the nearby towns of Hostalric and Blanes without putting much of a fight and one of its battalions even defected to the enemy as a whole.

Lowry was related to Governor Robert Lowry of Mississippi, who served from 1882 to 1890; the degree of kinship is not available. Born in rural Bellevue, once the seat of government of Bossier Parish, Lowry was the youngest of six children of J. A. W. Lowry, Sr. (1813-1847), and the former Sarah Alzenith Miles (1817-1878), a native of Woodville in Wilkinson County in southwestern Mississippi. He was born two weeks after the death of his father. He studied at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and taught school for a time before undertaking the private study of law. In 1875, the Louisiana Supreme Court admitted him to the bar. During the 1880s, he was the district attorney for the 2nd Judicial District (since the 26th District) for Bossier and neighboring Webster parishes. In 1896, he was elected to succeed G. L. P. Wren of Minden as a member of the Louisiana State Senate for Bienville, Bossier, Claiborne, and Webster parishes. He served alongside Thomas Wafer Fuller, a journalist from Minden who was later the Webster Parish school superintendent. When his successor, E. S. Dortch, took office in 1900, nearly a year after Lowry's death, the district was reduced to Bossier and Webster parishes, which had since been the configuration until 1992, when Bienville Parish and a section of Claiborne Parish were added to the district. For a brief time too Red River Parish was in Senate District 36. Though he is often called \\"Judge\\", it is unclear when he sat on the bench or which level of court on which he served. His judicial service would have been no more than five years and in the first half of the 1890s, after the publication in 1890 of his life story in The Biographical and Historical Memoirs of Northwest Louisiana. Lowry is interred at Bellevue Cemetery in Bossier Parish, along with his mother, wife, Elizabeth Eubank Lowry (1857-1927); sister, Martha Elizabeth \\"Pattie\\" Lowry Cade (1843-1913), and namesake nephew, John Augustus Cade (1878-1900), who died of a fever in Bossier Parish at the age of twenty-two.

The squadron recently moved to Italy from the 48th Fighter Wing at RAF Lakenheath, England. As part of the 31st Operations Group it conducts pararescue operations in support of higher command directives, at times utilizing HH-60G Pave Hawk and Lockheed HC-130 Hercules aircraft. The 57th Rescue Squadron is a combat-ready squadron of pararescue personnel capable of performing combat rescue and personnel retrieval missions in theaters of operations worldwide. Mission The 57th Rescue Squadron is a combat-ready search and rescue squadron of composed of USAF Pararescue and Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape personnel, capable of executing all-weather search and rescue missions day or night in hostile environments in support of USAFE, USEUCOM, and NATO operations. It employs advanced search and rescue equipment. The squadron is capable of deploying to any theater of operations in the world. History Air Rescue Service SB-17H Air Rescue Service SC-54D in flight The squadron was first activated at Lajes Field in the Azores in November 1952 as the 57th Air Rescue Squadron in a reorganization of Air Rescue Service. The 7th Air Rescue Squadron at Wheelus Field, Libya was expanded into a group and each of its remotely stationed lettered flights was replaced by a new squadron. The 57th replaced Flight B of the 7th Squadron and assumed its personnel and equipment. The squadron mission was to intercept aircraft in distress while crossing the Atlantic and to escort them back to Lajes Field. The 57th also provided search and rescue for both downed aircraft and for ships. One of the squadron's most notable achievements occurred in 1959, when a Portuguese ship, the SS Arnel, which had struck rocks near the island of Santa Maria. The squadron evacuated 48 persons from the Arnel. Air Rescue Service SH-19A By the early 1960s the squadron had assumed the mission of providing support for Project Gemini and Project Apollo space missions. To reflect this mission, it was renamed the 57th Air Recovery Squadron in July 1965. The following January Air Rescue Service became Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Service and all of its squadrons were renamed, no matter their mission. The squadron was inactivated at Lajes in late 1972, when the Portuguese Air Force assumed the mid-Atlantic rescue mission. The 57th was reactivated as the 57th Rescue Squadron at Lakenheath in February 2015. Personnel for the squadron came from the 56th Rescue Squadron, with no additional manpower or aircraft. Aircrews and the HH-60G Pave Hawk helicopters remained in the 56th Squadron. The separation of pararescue airmen into a separate unit \\"align[ed] the personnel recovery function within United States Air Forces Europe to the standard Air Force structure,\\" officials said. Creating two rescue squadrons at Lakenheath is intended to replicate combat conditions because pararescumen frequently deploy separately from their rescue helicopters and planes.

These poems were later added with Blake's Songs of Innocence to create the entire collection entitled \\"Songs of Innocence and of Experience Shewing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul\\". This collection included poems such as \\"The Tyger\\", \\"The Little Boy Lost\\", \\"Infant Joy\\" and \\"The Shepherd\\". These poems are illustrated with colorful artwork created by Blake first in 1789. The first printing in 1789 consisted of sixteen copies. None of the copies of Songs of Innocence are exactly alike as some of them are incomplete or were colored in posthumously \\"in imitation of\\" other copies. \\"The School Boy\\" is a poem written in the pastoral tradition that focuses on the downsides of formal learning. It considers how going to school on a summer day \\"drives all joy away\\". The boy in this poem is more interested in escaping his classroom than he is with anything his teacher is trying to teach. In lines 16‚Äì20, a child in school is compared to a bird in a cage. Meaning something that was born to be free and in nature, is instead trapped inside and made to be obedient. Poem transcription  What does each stanza mean?  First stanza: The school boy wakes and sees the sound of birds pleasant.it seemed to him as if the sky lark is singing with him . all of these was such a sweet company to him. Second stanza: The school boys spent their days in utter despair under the thread of teacher's presence. stanza three describes school, how when home-schooled you can sit happily and read. At school, there is no freedom; you will learn what you are told to learn, nothing more, nothing less. School cannot delight him. Stanza four compares good boy at school to a bird in a cage. A bird can't sing in a cage and also, a child can't be happy in school: his potential is restrained. Stanza five shows how people are dismayed at school and how students are stripped of their joy. The final stanza describes how school can never be fun, but it is like a cold winter's day blasting through the warm summer. In the last two stanzas Blake makes a heartfelt plea to parents using an extended metaphor of the natural cycles of life. In the world of nature, a bud grows into a flowering tree that will bear fruit as it matures. Blake references the seasons, describing how an Autumn harvest of fruit sustains life through the harsh Winter. In this way, he is illustrating how a happy childhood spent learning from the natural world will reap the benefits of a wise and fruitful old age. Sending children to school interferes with this natural cycle and results in a lifetime of unhappiness with no chance of cultivating wisdom. ''''' Illustration and form The illustration for this poem predominantly features elements of nature, which is reflected in the poem's content. At the bottom of the print, there are three human figures sitting down examining either the ground or something upon the ground. This indicates an interest in nature and of what it is compiled. Around the border of the print is a weaving of intertwined vines. Within these vines are foliage such as leaves and flowers-nature within nature. There is also a human figure perched near the base of the vines with her arms extended, reaching up into the climbing flora. Further up the vines, there are two human figures sitting in the crook of two separate vines, each one is reading. This could indicate that the farther one travels into nature, the more one will learn. This, based on Blake's emphasis on a \\"Natural\\" education. Also among the leaves and fruit of the vines, on the left of the print is a bird about to take flight. \\"Both victory and liberty [...] are associated with bird wings.\\" Birds can also symbolize knowledge and nature. The presence of the bird, further indicated the freedom and learning that can come from education from nature rather than the formal classroom. Arranged in six stanzas with five lines each, this poem follows a consistently patterned structure. It also contains a rhyme scheme of ABABB. Themes and critical analysis This poem highlights Blake's affinity for alternative methods of education. Consistently repeated is the draining element of schoolroom education and how it causes students to contribute poor learning and retention for students. Blake instead promotes learning outside the classroom, specifically he believes spontaneous and natural creativity flourishes. Furthermore, this desire to remove oneself from the classroom (a metaphor for society) is in reference to Anthony Ashley Cooper, the 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury's idea of retirement. In this instance, retirement means to remove oneself from society and return to nature in order to rejuvenate the soul and the imagination from the weary doggedness of society. Cooper believed that remaining in society for a long period of time would result in the soul becoming worn down and that nature was the only relief as it helped redevelop the idea of community and benevolence. The analogy of the bird and the boy is also evidence of the recurring theme of nature within this poem. As a poet of Romanticism, Blake puts an emphasis on nature, the subjective self and on emotions. Within this poem, the allusions to nature are everywhere referencing things such as summer, wind, blossoms, rain showers, birds and spring. Blake equates the seasons of the Earth to the seasons of the boy's life. Blake also analogizes the boy with a caged bird unable to sing, to attain its free place in nature, just like the boy. David Almond references \\"The School Boy\\" in his novel Skellig to validate his character Mina's non-formal learning provided to her by her mother and supplemented heavily by Blake's materials. Sahm writes that \\"Mina and her mother quote and reference Blake directly, and many of the characters share his interest in education, spirituality, and imagination. But more than merely quoting Blake's words, the characters in Skellig live and exemplify one of his primary ideas: that of contraries\\". Namely in Skellig, Almond uses \\"The Schoolboy\\" as primary evidence for his character Mina's non- traditional education, which ties in with the text of the poem which continually brings up how being in a traditional school setting is draining, and will make a boy \\"forget his youthful spring\\".

The cast includes Michael Ironside, Vanity, Lyle Alzado, Valerie Wildman, Nick Klar, Juliet Landau, Richard Sanders and Markham.  Plot  In the 2050s, extensive ecological damage has resulted in largely lawless areas that are controlled by mutant raiders. Harry Stark, an ex-cop who now works as a bounty hunter in the wastelands, saves a woman from mutant outlaws. After she pulls a knife on him, he knocks her unconscious and brings her back to town for her bounty. Captain Raymond, Stark's former commanding officer, tells him that the woman, Reno, must be brought to Neon City to collect his payment. Raymond requests that Stark ride shotgun on a transport that is going to Neon City, but he refuses. When Stark's truck blows up, Raymond claims it to be an act of terrorism by mutants. Stark attacks Raymond, only to be knocked unconscious and placed on the transport with Reno. On board the transport are Bulk, a former friend and ex-cop whom Stark once arrested; Tom, a serial killer who pretends to be a doctor; Dickie Devine, a clown; Sandy, Stark's ex-wife; Twink, the sheltered daughter of an influential Neon City politician; and Wing, an old man who keeps to himself. Before they leave, Raymond gives them the opportunity to receive a refund and stay behind, as mutant activity along the road has been excessive; all elect to go instead of staying and collecting a refund. Along the way, they pass through a deadly Xander Cloud, and, when they stop afterward, they meet a family who is suffering from extensive radiation damage. Stark buys a euthanasia kit from Devine and donates it to the grateful family. Disgusted, Reno calls Devine and Stark no better than herself. When they reach their first destination, an outpost where they are to meet with an escort, mutant raiders have killed almost everyone. The sole survivor, Bulk's sister, is entrusted to Tom, who pretends to aid her until the others leave him alone, after which he murders her. Reno saves Twink's life and flees the site on a motorcycle, but Stark recovers her. Stark proposes that they continue without the escort and surprises Reno when he gives her a vote. She sides with the majority, and they push on. Their next stop is at a restaurant staffed by mutants. Twink is surprised when the others treat the mutant staffers as equals. While on the road, mutant raiders attack, and Devine is wounded. They jettison some of their cargo to escape. After they barely survive a \\"bright\\", an intense temperature change, Tom murders Devine. After burying Devine, the transport encounters a shelter, where they rest and recuperate. Tom tries to force himself on Reno, but she beats him; Tom claims she could not handle his rejection. Reno and Stark bond as he consoles her, and she reveals that she killed her foster parents accidentally when fleeing from their child prostitution ring. After they have sex, Reno asks Stark to run away with her, but he refuses to leave the others. After discussing the world's ecological damage with Wing, Bulk realizes that Wing is actually Dr. Xander, the scientist responsible for much of the damage. Xander explains that he was attempting to solve the world's problems, and, if he reached a proper laboratory, he might be able to reverse the effects. Bulk promises not to turn him in, and they return to their journey. During the next mutant raid, they run out of ammunition. Xander improvises a laser weapon that saves them, but not before Sandy is shot and the transport finally dies. Xander elects to leave for the border, and the rest walk to Neon City, which is nearby. Tom gives Sandy a dose of painkillers. When they arrive at Neon City, Twink expedites their entry and smooths things over between Stark and the local police, who are commanded by Jenkins, a man with a grudge against Stark. When Sandy dies of a massive drug overdose, Tom is finally exposed. He takes Reno hostage, but Stark kills him. This results in a standoff between Stark and Jenkins; Reno calms Stark, and they leave together. When Jenkins asks about his prisoner, Stark says she died during transport. As they leave Neon City, Stark and Reno pick up Xander.

Having had difficulty with sexism in the past, she used a masculine pseudonym, Buck Finch, to sell the script. The protagonist was originally a woman, but the producers cast Ironside as the lead. Shooting took place in Salt Lake County, Utah. Principal photography ended in March 1991.  Reception  Reviews compared it to Stagecoach. TV Guide rated it 2/4 stars and wrote, \\"Neon City is far from the worst Road Warrior rerun ever, although that's truly faint praise.\\" References External links * * Category:1991 films Category:1990s science fiction films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian independent films Category:Canadian science fiction films Category:English-language films Category:Post-apocalyptic films Category:Films set in the 2050s Category:Films shot in Utah ","title":"Neon City"},{"id":"46210871","title":"Melvin Williams (musician)"},{"id":"46210883","text":"Main entrance Lyc√©e Paul Val√©ry (LPV) is a French international school in Mekn√®s, Morocco.

The cast includes Sam Bishop, Chris Carlson, Daniel Duff, Todd huffman, Leon Jester, Michael Mansfield, and Jodie Whitley. Director: T. Michael McGee. Starring: Sam Bishop, Chris Carlson, Daniel Duff, Todd Huffman, Leon Jester, Michael Mansfield, Judie Whitley. Released: 1995. Runtime: 75 minutes. Language: English. Country: United States. Synopsis In the post apocalyptic world of the 21st century the Unified Commonwealth struggles to restore civilization to the survivors of the Great Plague. A constant state of war exists as the female dominated army of the Commonwealth must fight the plague scared male dominated Bandits of the Marchlands who are supported by the alien Zisk. A race of humanoid clones bent on the subjugation of the human race. During a brutal attack on the Commonwealth outpost of Galatia. Sgt Chase Badham is sent on a desperate mission that may turn the tide of the war. Production The films idea originated in 1987. It came from Writer/Director McGee wanting to combine his military experience with the science fiction genre. Inspired by post-apocalyptic films like Planet of the Apes and Damnation Alley. He sought to use his experience as a visual effects artist to create and abandoned earth of the late 21st century using miniatures on a shoe string budget. He spent the summer of 1993 creating all the miniature vehicles, props, sets and costumes for the film only to have a freak windstorm collapse his storage building spreading the precious assets all over his neighborhood. With help of friends he was able to repair/recreate everything so that he could still meet his start date of December 1993. The film was shot in and around Roanoke and Salem, Virginia from December 1993 until August 1995. Production was not continuous as McGee would halt production to take paying jobs as a videographer and editor to pay the bills and finance the film. The film includes over 300 miniature special effects shots. Due to lack of suitable abandoned locations; literally entire sequences take place inside miniature locations. The shoot utilized many on-set, in-camera miniature shots combining actors and miniatures in the same shot in camera. On location in camera pyrotechnics were used to heighten the reality of combat. Unusual for a low budget picture of the time there are even some digital efx animation used for laser beams. Sequel A sequel/ special edition was proposed in 2005. It actually began in earnest in late fall of 2008. Sentinel 2099 SE as it is now known is complete and awaiting DVD release. The sequel expands the back story and reveals many new characters. It also delves into the alien villains the Zisk. As of March 2017 a companion web series is in preproduction with fund raising being done on various crowdfunding websites.

June 2019 Lennon Wall (), in the Hong Kong context, originally referred to the mosaic wall created during the Umbrella Movement, located at Central Government Complex, Harcourt Road, Admiralty. The wall is one of the major artworks of the Umbrella Movement as a collective artistic work of spontaneous free expression, demanding democracy in the elections of the territory's top leaders. It was a space of encouragement and solidarity, full of colourful Post-It notes (more than ten thousand pieces) with messages advocating for freedom, democracy and universal suffrage. Post types included epigrams, lyrics, poems, foreign words and hand-drawn graphics. During the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests, there were coordinated preservation efforts to digitally document the wall and related protest art. After over two months of occupy actions by democracy activists, most of the artworks were removed from original positions prior to police clearance operations. Many protesters and citizens have tried to re- create some of the artworks, especially the Hong Kong Lennon Wall. During the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests, new Lennon Walls appeared in numerous locations across the territory, typically near transport interchanges. Lennon Wall in Prague The original Lennon Wall was first created in Prague, Czechoslovakia, following the murder of John Lennon. It was filled with art as well as lyrics from the Beatles. In 1988, a year before the Velvet Revolution, this wall became a way for people to express irritation with the communist regime of Gust√°v Hus√°k. Since the 1980s, the wall has been continuously undergoing changes while the original portrait of John Lennon is long lost under layers of new paint. Nowadays, the wall in Prague is a symbol of global ideals such as love and peace, which served as inspiration for the Hong Kong Lennon Wall of the 2014 Umbrella Movement. During the 2019 extradition bill protests that followed, Hong Kong democracy activist Marco Leung Ling-kit died, becoming a symbol for the movement. Within weeks, artists in Prague had painted a memorial on the wall, with an image of the yellow raincoat he was wearing during the banner drop that eventually led to a fall. Words of encouragement and solidarity were also written, including the famous phrase: \\"Hong Kong, Add oil.\\" History Close view of Hong Kong Lennon Wall on 2014-10-02 Close view of Hong Kong Lennon Wall on 2014-10-18 Hong Kong Lennon Wall on 2014-11-01 We are dreamers\\" ‚Äì a message written before the police takeover occupied areas. 11 December 2014 Umbrella Movement Police arrested a fourteen-year-old girl for drawing flowers on the wall with chalk, threatening her father with removal of custody, and not releasing her back to her family until 20 days later. She quickly became known as \\"Chalk Girl\\" (Á≤âÁ≠ÜÂ∞ëÂ•≥) when pictures of her drawing circulated on social media. Her lawyer, Patricia Ho, stated that the government response to a chalk drawing was \\"disproportionate\\" and that \\"police are using whatever mechanism they can think of to stop teenagers from participating in any protest.\\" A short film about her story, titled \\"The Infamous Chalk Girl\\" was released in 2017. =29 September 2014= The day after the occupation started in Mong Kok, the occupation area expanded from Nathan Road and Argyle Street to Mong Kok Road, Sai Yeung Choi Street and so on. Vehicles were trapped because of the full-occupation of all six roadways in Nathan Road while many bus routes had to be rerouted. Meanwhile, those trapped buses and discontinued bus stops became the place where protestors and citizens stuck their opinions of requesting the stepdown of CY Leung and the slogans to call for universal suffrage, which were written mainly on cardboard and papers instead of post tips, which became the prototype for the Lennon Wall in Admiralty. =1 October 2014= The Lennon Wall in Hong Kong was created by a group of post-80s social workers, Lee Shuk-ching and Chow Chi. They bought post-its and invited people to write down their hopes and reasons for stay after around three days after police had tried to disperse protesters by firing tear gas. The first post was \\"Why Are We Here?\\" . After that, they stuck their posts, left their pens and post-its, inviting others to write their wishes. The message board started to expand and eventually colonised the entire wall beside the staircase heading to the Hong Kong Central Government Offices. Following over ten thousand notes being stuck onto the wall, this wall became the focus of media. Since the theme and format were found to be similar to the Lennon Wall in Prague of Czech Republic, the banner of \\"Lennon Wall Hong Kong\\" was set on the outside wall of the staircase which turned the wall into one of the landmarks for the occupied area in Admiralty. The banner of Lennon Wall Hong Kong also became the Facebook page created by Lee Shuk- ching and Chow Chi for recording the posts on Lennon Wall later on as well. =18 October 2014= An internet version of Lennon Wall was developed as a historical database to record the Umbrella Movement. Due to the clearance action of police, the originator was apprehensive that those post-its would be obliterated. She decided to create an online Lennon Wall and convert approximate ten thousand post-its into electronic form. =13 December 2014= In the study room of Causeway Bay occupation site, some secondary school students who joined the Central occupation used expanded polystyrene to construct a mini Lennon Wall. As the police had already announced that it would proceed with the eviction of the Causeway Bay occupation area on 15 December, citizens went there and left their heartfelt wishes. It became a scenic spot for taking photos. =20 December 2014= In the stair outside Central Government Offices, citizens tried to rebuild the Lennon Wall. They stuck posters printed with \\"It is just the beginning\\", \\"We will be back\\" and \\"Umbrella Movement\\" on the wall. The staff of Leisure and Cultural Services Development attempted to stop them. Although police noticed their action, police did not take action to interfere. 2019 anti-extradition bill protests Lennon Tunnel near Tai Po Market Station. 7 July 2019 Austin Station. 9 July 2019 =Background= During the series of protests against the China-Extradition bill beginning on 9 June, the original Lennon Wall has been once again set up in front of the Hong Kong Central Government Offices staircase. During the months of June and July, Lennon Walls with similar encouraging messages written on post-it notes and regular paper have been put up throughout the entire Hong Kong. This is referred to as \\"blossoming everywhere\\" (). Known neighbourhood Lennon Walls include Sheung Shui, Tin Shui Wai, Sha Tin, Fanling, Ma On Shan, Tsing Yi, Tung Chung, Tai Po, Sai Ying Pun, Shek Tong Tsui, Causeway Bay, Sai Wan Ho, Chai Wan, Choi Hung, Wong Tai Sin, Kwun Tong, Mei Foo, Kowloon Bay, Whampoa, and Tai Kok Tsui, as well as many others on Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and outlying islands. There are even some Lennon Walls located inside government offices, including RTHK and the Policy Innovation and Co-ordination Office. According to a crowd-sourced map of Hong Kong, there are over 150 Lennon Walls throughout the region. Lennon Walls have also appeared outside of Hong Kong in the cities of: Toronto, Vancouver BC, Tokyo, Berlin, London, Melbourne, Manchester, Sydney, and Taipei. Messages of solidarity for the Hong Kong democracy movement have also been added to the very first and oldest Lennon Wall in Prague. =Events= At midnight on 9 July, more than 200 police officers equipped with shields and helmets stormed into the Tai Po subway that hosted the popular Tai Po Lennon Walls. Police photographed and removed several pieces of paper that allegedly contained the personal information of an officer who, while on duty on 8 July, challenged a peaceful protester to \\"remember me, and have a fight with me.\\" Several Lennon Walls around Hong Kong have been reportedly vandalised within the first few days of being set up. To prevent vandalism, the Mong Kok Lennon Wall is situated at a private property with warning messages to ward off vandals. On 10 July hundreds of people gathered near the Lennon Wall by the Yau Tong MTR station in Kowloon, after word spread that local residents, suspected of being off-duty policemen from the nearby Yau Mei Court, were threatening pro-democracy youth who were tidying up the wall. Police later arrived, and the conflict persisted for several hours; a handful of arrests were made by the end of the night, including the arrests of two retired police officers for assaulting democracy activists. On the next day, a pro-Beijing middle-aged man was arrested for physically assaulting two victims, one of which refused to defend himself or retaliate, when he attempted to tear the sticky notes from a Lennon Wall near Kowloon Bay. Lennon Wall Flag, a flag proposed as an alternative to the black bauhinia flower flag Influence around the world A Lennon Wall in support of the 2019 Hong Kong protest at the University of Auckland, New Zealand In 2019 and after, Lennon Wall installations sprang up around the world in support of Hong Kong protests against a proposed law to allow easier extradition of criminal suspects to Mainland China.

The district encompasses the city's historic Near West and Southwest neighborhoods and was formed beginning in the 1850s and continuing through the 1920s. Nearly all of the popular architectural styles from this period are represented in the district. A number of professional architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright, designed homes in the district, giving it exceptionally high-quality architecture. The earlier houses mainly have Italianate designs; several Gothic Revival buildings from this period are also included. The Queen Anne and Classical Revival styles were popular in houses built in the late 19th century, though Romanesque and Tudor Revival houses were also designed in this period. The early 20th century brought the district the Colonial Revival style and several independent styles associated with the more prominent architects such as Wright. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 7, 1976.

The film stars Sarah Gadon as the teenaged Princess Elizabeth, who, with younger sister Princess Margaret (Bel Powley), ventures out of Buckingham Palace to enjoy the VE Day celebrations. Plot On VE Day in 1945, as peace is declared across Europe and London is celebrating, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret are allowed to join the celebrations, against the Queen's wishes. The King, impressed by Elizabeth's pleading, asks her to report back on the people's feelings towards him and his midnight speech on the radio. Each girl, incognito, is chaperoned by an army officer with an itinerary to be back at Buckingham Palace by 1 a.m. Soon realising the Queen's planned itinerary does not fulfil their expectations of fun and meeting the ordinary people, Margaret is the first to slip away from her escort, followed by Elizabeth. The princesses are separated on two different buses. Margaret is befriended by a naval officer seeking to take advantage of what he believes is just an ordinary girl, and Elizabeth by an airman who is absent without leave. Margaret is led by her naval officer into a world of nightclubs, gambling, spiked drinks and brothels. Elizabeth and her airman have their own adventures trying to catch up with Margaret, which take them far beyond the 1 a.m. deadline into the early hours of the following morning. Cast The character of Pryce is credited as a Lieutenant, but is shown as, and referred to as, Captain Pryce throughout the film. Relation to actual events The two officer escorts and the airman in the screenplay were fictional creations. In reality, the princesses in an organised group of 16 went out at 10 p.m. to mingle with revellers, and returned to Buckingham Palace at 1 a.m. Release A Royal Night Out was released in the United Kingdom on 8 May 2015 and on DVD on 7 September 2015.

The work was commissioned by the Minnesota Orchestra and completed in 2004.Rouse, Christopher. Oboe Concerto: Program Note by the Composer. 2008. Retrieved March 24, 2015. The piece premiered in 2009 with oboist Basil Reeve and the Minnesota Orchestra performing under conductor Osmo Vanska. Composition The Oboe Concerto is composed in three connected movements, following the traditional fast-slow-fast form. A five- note chord introduced by the strings at the beginning of the piece lays the groundwork for much of the harmonic material of the concerto. Inspiration Rouse designed the piece as a non-programmatic work, commenting in the score notes: Despite this, principal oboist Liang Wang of the New York Philharmonic, who performed the concerto's New York City premiere, said, \\"I think this is certainly a love story. And it captures some of the best qualities of the oboe, which is if you just take one note it can give you many different colors.\\" Instrumentation The concerto is scored for solo oboe and an orchestra comprising two flutes, piccolo (doubling alto flute), two clarinets, two bassoons, two French horns, two trumpets, three trombones, percussion (three players), harp, celesta, and strings (violins I & II, violas, violoncellos, and double basses). Reception Reviewing the 2013 New York City premiere of the piece, Steve Smith of The New York Times commented, \\"...few living composers rival Mr. Rouse‚Äôs knack for the grotesque, the elemental and the bombastic. And the oboe, for all its politesse, is capable of producing positively hideous multiphonics and other unorthodox effects. [...] But in Mr. Rouse‚Äôs concerto, the principal test for the soloist is to produce seemingly endless lines that float weightless over aural backgrounds that shimmer and sigh in summer-afternoon languor.\\" David Patrick Stearns of The Philadelphia Inquirer praised the concerto as \\"distinguished\\" and said, \\"Sonorities seemed like characters: Muted brass seemed simultaneously comic and ominous. Hushed string chords didn't point in any further direction but bristled with an energy that suggests the piece could explode at any time. Harp and celesta added dreamy touches that could turn nightmarish.\\" Stearns continued, \\"The younger Rouse wrote music that went to many extremes. Here, extremes are more implied possibilities, and are just as powerful. Though the oboe writing was full of animation, the best moments felt more like an invocation (in the incantatory sense of the word).\\" Fellow composer James Primosch of the University of Pennsylvania also praised the work, saying, \\"I was most taken with the slow music ‚Äì exquisite colors, both in the sense of harmony and of orchestral timbre. The contrasting fast playful sections are brilliant, but it was the ecstatic stillness supporting the intensely lyrical Woodhams oboe that was most striking.\\" References Category:Concertos by Christopher Rouse Category:2004 compositions Rouse Category:Compositions for symphony orchestra Category:21st-century classical music Category:Music commissioned by the Minnesota Orchestra ","title":"Oboe Concerto (Rouse)"},{"id":"46211031","text":"U Microscopii is a Mira variable star in the constellation Microscopium.

Donnellan moved from New South Wales to South Australia in 1985 to undertake research recovering the evolutionary history of Australia's lizards. This work led to the establishment of a comprehensive collection of reptile and frog tissues from Australia and New Guinea. In 1990 Donnellan joined the South Australian Museum's staff and established the DNA laboratory there. His research since has focused on the evolution and biogeography of Australasian fauna. Donnellan has used molecular genetic methods to examine issues in the population genetics, phylogeography and phylogenetic relationships of vertebrates and selected invertebrate groups. Many of his research projects have been supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC). His work has been published in numerous scientific journals, including Biological Conservation, Evolution, International Journal for Parasitology, PLOS One, Restoration Ecology, Zoologica Scripta and Zootaxa.  Giant Australian cuttlefish  In the 2000s, Donnellan studied Sepia apama, the giant Australian cuttlefish, in South Australian waters with Bronwyn Gillanders from the University of Adelaide. While analysing its population structure and movement patterns, he developed a fondness for the animal. He has described its mass breeding aggregation at Point Lowly near Whyalla as \\"a fantastic natural phenomenon.\\" Donnellan ultimately determined that a genetically distinct population of the species exists, confined to the waters of Northern Spencer Gulf. In 2011, Donnellan expressed concern over the diminishing population forming the breeding aggregation at Point Lowly, and said that he believed constructing a new desalination plant nearby could have further adverse impacts.

The protests were a response to the smuggling and parallel trading problem in Hong Kong. Overview Protestors claim that the parallel traders from mainland and Hong Kong have congested Sheung Shui Station, suspected of smuggling, long-term occupation of nearby passages at Sheung Shui while indirectly taking it up as a cause of inflation of certain goods, seriously affecting the neighbourhood nearby. There were about 350 netizens respond to the call made within social networks, including HKGolden forum and Facebook. They concentrated the demonstration at Exit C of Sheung Shui MTR station. The campaign lasted for more than 4 hours respectively on both days. Parallel trading Since the Individual Visit Scheme has been implemented in 2003, more and more people from mainland China visit Hong Kong and buy a lot of daily necessities, such as infant formula, then they would carry a great amount of goods back to China, and these kinds of people are parallel traders. Parallel traders are mainly active near the MTR East-Rail Stations, especially in Sheung Shui Station. They often line up next to the station and distribute the goods that they have bought. In Hong Kong, there are general agency companies distributing orders to the supermarkets and shops for wholesaling. Any trading activities that has bypassed the distribution from general agency company and sourced their goods by the seller itself either from overseas or mainland in order to escape from taxation would be considered as parallel trading. In explaining the situation in Sheung Shui, shops are selling their goods in bulk to those mainlanders and Hongkongers to carry across the border for the receivers at Shenzhen. Some of them will also sell to the tourists. The products that are being carried across the border will be then parallel trading products while considering the whole activity as a parallel trade. Sometimes, shops in Shatin will even take bulk orders from shops across the broader that may involve illegal smuggling activities. Process 15 September 2012 On 15/9 at 2pm, hundreds of netizens respond to the call on the social network and gathered at the Exit C of Sheung Shui MTR station for the demonstration, screaming the slogan of \\"defending the nest\\" (‰øùË°õÂÆ∂Âúí), in exaggerating seriousness of how the parallel trading industry has affected the life of the resident living in Sheung Shui. Protestor abused the parallel traders whenever they saw them, they also called them \\"locusts\\". Later these two groups of people fought with each other. Police set up some barricades in order to divide the two groups and stable the situation. The protesters left at around 6:30p.m 16 September 2012 The next day, over a hundred netizens continued the restoration campaign at Sheung Shui, with about 350 people at maximum. During the campaign, a protester held a flag of \\"Hong Kong\\" causing the dissatisfaction of the onlookers from Hong Kong and mainlands. It also led to opposition from the supporters as they thought that the whole campaign had deteriorated. Since there was no sign of parallel traders on the day of protest, there was no confrontation between any party on that day. However, one of the protesters had been escorted by the police to leave the area because of him causing troubles to the neighbourhood. After that, the protest group then marched to one of the major collecting and distributing centres at Advanced Technology Centre and the security has to shut down the gate to prevent riots from happening. Other than that, members from Hong Kong Autonomy Movement set up stations on the footbridge near Sheung Shui MTR station to collect signatures from the residents nearby in order to raise their concerns to the government and take immediate actions to restrict Individual Visit Scheme and to combat the parallel trading problems. The campaign lasted about four hours. The protesters then left. 18 September 2012 At around 8 pm, the protesters and residents from Sheung Shui gathered again at Sheung Shui Station to strangle the parallel trading activities claiming that the parallel traders have caused a great level of inconvenience to the neighbourhood nearby. They quarrelled with each other, causing disruptions in the area. Some even challenged the police line of control. Police officers have dispatched to maintain the order. Before the event happened, the Secretary of Security Lai Tung-Kwok said that the situation has been improved since both of the Customs and Excise Department of Shenzhen and Hong Kong started to combat these activities. He also mentioned that the obstruction outside Lo Wu and Sheung Shui Station have been improved and those parallel traders were no longer active in others ports Government response The government has implemented different measures in response to parallel trading in order to help restoration in Sheung Shui. For the internal measures, the Hong Kong Government has announced to the public that they would have six major steps to combat the problem, including the removal of the traders' goods when they caused blockage of street and the warning to people who caused dispute and negative influences to the locals. The Customs and Excise Department and the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department has increased the manpower at Lo Wo port and Lok Ma Chau port and send some plain-clothed staffs and spies to collect information from the parallel traders and to revise the appearance of Sheung Shui respectively. Besides, the Hong Kong Police Force has enforced the surveillance on the parallel traders and maintain the order and send the Police Tactical Unit to the industrial centre to blockade both entrance and exit so as to drive them away. They also strictly measured the size of traders' baggage and strictly abide by the law. The Hong Kong Police Force has combined with other law-enforced departments to take sudden inspection at different black spots of parallel trading in Sheung Shui.

Origins Prominent in East Sussex for generations, the family's home in Brede, which he improved and extended, had been built in the 14th century. Probably born in the 1470s,As he was apparently engaged in lawsuits with the abbot of Battle in 1480-83, a birthdate in the 1450s or 1460 seems more likely. See National Archives, Early Chancery proceedings, C 1/61/549 (AALT). he was the son and heir of Robert Oxenbridge (died 1487), of Brede, and his wife Ann Livelode (died 1494). His unmarried brother was John Oxenbridge (died 1522), a Canon of Windsor, and his sister Magdalen (died 1544) was the mother of the courtier Sir Nicholas Carew. Life As a major landowner, both by inheritance and by his first marriage, he had extensive estates to manage but his status also made him eligible for public duties. In 1506 he served his first spell as sheriff of Surrey and Sussex, being selected again in 1512 and 1519. On 23 June 1509, in honour of the coronation of King Henry VIII, he was made a Knight of the Bath. In 1511 and 1512 he was appointed to Commissions of the Peace. On 24 May 1522, he was one of the knights summoned to join the Papal legate, Cardinal Wolsey, at Canterbury and then to proceed to Dover to greet the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V. Dying on 10 February 1531, he was buried at Brede and his tomb, now in the church of St George, bears his armoured effigy. Landholdings His will, proved on 27 October 1531, disposed of his property which included manors, advowsons and lands, most rural but some urban, in Beckley, Brede, Brightling, Burwash, Catsfield, Crowhurst, Etchingham, Ewhurst, Guestling, Hastings, Icklesham, Northiam, Ockham, Peasmarsh, Playden, Rye, Salehurst, Snailham, Southwark (including the White Horse inn), Ticehurst, Udimore and Winchelsea. Several of these manors had descended to him by marriage from the Echyngham family patrimony, and Sir Goddard was unsuccessfully challenged for title to them by Edward Echyngham of Barsham, Suffolk, the surviving male heir of the elder Sir Thomas Echyngham (died 1444), during the early 1520s.The National Archives, Early Chancery Proceedings ref. C 1/502/35 and C 1/502/36. View originals at AALT, images 0078 through 0082. Family His first wife was Elizabeth, the widow of Roger Fiennes (died before 1486), possibly a son of Richard Fiennes, 7th Baron Dacre. She was the daughter and co-heiress of Sir Thomas Etchingham (died 1486), of Etchingham, and his wife Margaret, daughter of Reginald West, 6th Baron De La Warr. They had one child: :Sir Thomas (died 1540), of Etchingham, who married Elizabeth Puttenham, and had a daughter Elizabeth, wife of Sir Robert Tyrwhitt, of Kettleby. His second wife was Anne (died 1531), the widow of John Windsor, brother of Andrew Windsor, 1st Baron Windsor, and the daughter of Sir Thomas Fiennes, of Claverham in Arlington (also a son of Richard Fiennes, 7th Baron Dacre), and his wife Anne Urswick. Their children included: :Sir Robert (died 1574), of Hurstbourne Priors, an MP and Constable of the Tower. :Elizabeth (died 1578), courtier and author, who married Sir Robert Tyrwhitt, of Leighton Bromswold.  Legend of the Brede Giant  During his lifetime rumours were spread about him. The likely source were smugglers who were secretly using Sir Goddard's estate as one of their bases. Oxenbridge was said to be invulnerable to metal weapons and only wooden weapons would kill him. He had great stature, was described as a giant of a man, and referred to as the Brede Giant and the Sussex Ogre. This helped to make these stories more cogent to some of the local populace. The rumours had it that he devoured a child every night for supper. Several children had disappeared from the locality. Gossip and the smugglers spread the rumour that Goddard was a cannibal, but he was observed to be a pious Christian so the rumours were discounted by most people. The story says that Goddard Oxenbridge's life was ended when in a drunken state he was sawn in two with a wooden saw at Groaning Bridge by children who believed in the rumours. It has been suggested that these stories were spread about the Catholic Oxenbridge by Protestants during the Reformation. Another telling of the story suggests that the legend originated some 200 years after his death. Brede Place was purchased in 1708 mainly for the land, and the house allowed to fall into disrepair. It was then that smugglers took over the house and spread rumours that it was now haunted by Oxenbridge's ghost, and either concocted the tale or built upon it about his former child-eating habits.

He invented a mechanical corn harvester at the age of seventeen, after realizing the need for labor-saving machinery on the farm. While the device was never patented, it was adopted by several manufacturers of farm equipment. The depression of the 1890s drove Dovel, his wife and children to the city, where he was hired at Columbus Steam and Boiler Company. Within days, he was promoted to foreman, launching a long career in industrial invention. In 1905 Dovel moved to Birmingham to become superintendent of the Birmingham Engineering Company. While there, he supervised construction of a blast furnace for Woodward Iron Company. Four years later, he joined the Sloss Furnace Company as superintendent of construction. For the next twenty-one years, Dovel developed gas cleaning equipment, modified the design of the furnaces, and improved the linings of the furnaces. In all, some seventeen patents are credited to Dovel. Sloss's No. 2 Furnace, rebuilt in 1927, included many of these inventions, earning Dovel and Sloss a national reputation for innovation. Arthritis confined Dovel to bed in 1933.

Wacker) is a 101-story, supertall skyscraper under construction in Chicago, Illinois. Construction started in August 2016 and is expected to be completed in 2020. Upon completion, Vista Tower will become the city's third-tallest building at , surpassing the Aon Center, and the tallest structure in the world designed by a woman. Designed by architect Jeanne Gang and her architectural firm, Studio Gang Architects, Vista Tower will complement the design of the nearby Aqua skyscraper, also designed by Gang, as the two tallest structures in the world designed by a woman. A joint project between Magellan Development Group and Chinese based Wanda Group, Vista Tower will cost nearly $1 billion to construct. The structure consists of three interconnected towers with differing heights. According to Studio Gang Architects, the tower \\"presents itself as three interconnected volumes of differing heights, moving rhythmically in and out of plane\\" as a result of the curvilinear design. The tower topped out in April 2019. It will form a part of the Lakeshore East development. Usage Vista Tower will contain nearly 400 condominium residences, and a five-star Wanda Vista Hotel with around 200 hotel rooms. The Wanda Vista Hotel will be located on the first 11 floors, while the condos will be located between floors 13 and 93. Additional floors are occupied by mechanical space and parking. Design The building's chief architect is Jeanne Gang, head of Studio Gang Architects and Chicago based bKL Architecture is the project's architect of record. Vista Tower is composed of three interconnected volumes with differing heights. Totalling a height of 101 stories, the east, middle, and west towers are 47, 71, and 93 stories tall, respectively. Mechanical space occupies the remaining floors. Upon completion, Vista Tower designers are targeting a Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. The three towers feature a curvilinear design, and are made up of alternating frustums. The towers are cladded in 6 different shades of glass. The uppermost segment of the tallest tower contains unoccupied \\"blow through\\" floor to prevent the structure from swaying in the wind. This design was described as \\"stacks of tapering, truncated pyramids that alternate between right-side-up and upside- down\\" by the Chicago Tribune. The tower has a notably smaller footprint than other supertalls in Chicago; Vista has a building height-to-core aspect ratio of 40-to-1. The architecture of record is bKL Architecture. Condominium interiors will be designed by hospitality design firm Hirsch Bedner Associates, while the hotel interior will be designed by San Francisco firm Gensler. Philadelphia-based OLIN will design the project's green spaces, including the rooftop gardens. The structural engineering of the tower was managed by Magnusson Klemencic Associates. OLIN was the landscape architect for the project.  Columns  Unlike most buildings, Vista's perimeter columns step inward and outward instead of going directly upwards. Each column projects about 5 inches outward or inward from the one below it. This was chosen over using columns set over a diagonal, which would have sacrificed interior space.  Wind resistance  The tower uses coupled dual-core shear-wall assembly that connects the three buildings for wind resistance. The two outer cores are tied together via a 508-ft-tall reinforced concrete spine, from floors 15 to 51 above the upper street grade. For gravity loads, columns that continue to foundations support a 123-ft-long spine wall. This 2-ft-thick spine transfers wind loads from the middle tower to the cores of the 51-story tower to the east and the 101-story tower to the west. Vista will contain uninhabited \\"blow-through floors\\" to reduce wind-induced sway. Six tanks, holding more than of water, counteract the movement of the wind. A \\"spine wall\\" in the tower‚Äôs midsection links two outer cores, helping the two towers act as one unit. The wall is perforated so doors and hallways go through. A \\"buttressed core\\" in the two outer stalks are built out to the outer edge of the building. The outer walls are also perforated, leaving openings for windows.  Reception  Edward Keegan of Crain's Chicago Business praised the design of the building, calling it \\"second only to Hancock in the gracefulness in its silhouette\\" and a \\"proud and soaring thing\\". However, he also criticised several engineering choices, notably the execution of the tower's blow-through floors.

It is located beside the Silay City Public Plaza at Rizal Street, and a meter away from the San Diego Cathedral Church.  History  Silay North Elementary School was an offshoot of the Gabaldon Act in 1970, which gave insular aid for the construction of a public school in every municipality of the Philippines. Established in 1907, Silay North was already 100 years last 2007. The school was actually a one-storey concrete building, which now houses the intermediate classes. A two-storey private house in the primary building was utilized by the city government to accommodate other classes. Last 2006, the primary building which comprises sixteen classrooms was vacated as per advised by the City Engineer's Office of Silay City after inspection. After World War II, a modern toilet was constructed for boys and girls. This was followed later by separate building for a lunch counter. During the early terms of President Ferdinand E. Marcos, a Marcos type of classroom building was further added to accommodate more classes. Because of the limited school area, few buildings were added such as computer laboratory and Grade 1 classrooms, which were all donated by the Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. During the Japanese occupation, the primary building was used as the Japanese garrison and many infamous investigations took place in those rooms. The Japanese government opened the school for school children who ere left in the town and classes were held in the intermediate building. When the American forces liberated the town, the 51st Division of the US Army also occupied the buildings. The primary building was made into an Infirmary area while the intermediate building was turned into living quarters and a mess hall.  Disaster  In the year 2011, a major earthquake struck the country, particularly some regions in Negros Occidental. One of the buildings was badly affected causing structural leaks and damages. The building was closed temporarily for a lengthy renovation due to budget deficiency, which prompted the request for further public donation. The students volunteered to help the school administration by fixing some furniture of their classrooms.  Present  At present, Silay North Elementary School has seventeen permanent small and big buildings, including the comfort rooms and dilapidated buildings. However, due to shortage of classrooms, sections were fused from seven to eight to five over six sections only. The school produces more than thousands of graduates every year.

Human‚Äìlion conflict refers to the pattern of problematic interactions between native people and lions. Conflict with humans is a major contributor of the decline in lion populations in Africa. Habitat loss and fragmentation due to conversion of land for agriculture has forced lions to live in closer proximity to human settlements. As a result, conflict is often characterized by lions preying upon livestock, known as livestock depredation. When depredation events take place, farmers suffer financial losses and lions face threats of retaliatory killing. Causes of conflict The main cause of conflict is habitat loss. 83% of the African lion's range has been reduced and what remains is increasingly fragmented. Lions, as large carnivores, rely on large connected expanses of land. The conversion of their habitat into agricultural land prevents them from dispersing and can limit the availability of natural prey. Lions are therefore roaming closer to farms than before and are at a higher risk of preying on livestock. Ecological variables There are many ecological variables that can affect likelihood of depredation. Factors such as farms' distance from water sources, protected areas, elevation and surrounding vegetative cover may all play a role. Some research has shown that depredation decreases with distance from protected areas. This could be because access to nearby conservation areas provides lions with a refuge when coming into contact with humans. Farms that are located close to water sources and at a low elevation may be especially vulnerable to conflict. The effect of vegetative cover remains unclear. Dense vegetative cover has been associated with a higher rate of depredation yet has also been shown to reduce depredation as it allows predators to hide from humans. Farm and livestock management can also affect chances of depredation. Corralling livestock at night as well as providing guards to monitor lion movements to prevent and deter predation can limit losses. Financial losses Depredation events lead to financial losses to farmers who rely on livestock as a source of income. In the North West province of South Africa, around $375, 797USD were lost as a result of game and livestock losses caused by depredation. Lions are not the only predators involved, with hyenas, leopards, and wild dogs responsible for depredation events as well. However, lions typically attack cattle which incur higher financial losses than sheep and goats (hunted by hyenas and leopards). Compensation In order to lessen these financial losses, some regions offer financial compensation to affected farmers. However, these programs are not always effective. Major criticisms revolve around the response times of programs, arguing that they take too long or do not happen at all. Additionally, farmers do not always receive sufficient financial restitution. For example, as of 2009, Botswana's state-funded compensation program only compensated farmers for 80% of the value they lost. It is common for farmers to not even report livestock losses due in part to dissatisfaction with response time and amount. However, the Predator Compensation Fund (PCF) in Massailand, Kenya has reduced retaliatory killings following depredation events by 73%, illustrating that when done correctly, compensation programs can be effective. Farmers who have received compensation have also reported a lower likelihood of killing a suspected lion than those who have not received any. Regardless of their efficacy, compensation programs are reactionary and not preventative, only seeking to mitigate farmers' losses after the event and do not address underlying causes of conflict Retaliatory killing Retaliatory killing is the hunting of a suspected predator after a depredation event. While a threat for all predators, lions are killed disproportionately to the number of losses they are responsible for as opposed to hyenas and leopards. One reason lions are killed in retaliation more than other carnivores is because of their propensity to kill cattle more than sheep and goats. Because cattle are of more financial value to farmers than sheep and goats, the desire to retaliate can be greater. Lions also will hunt during the night when most attacks take place, are easier to track, and are more likely to defend a carcass which make them more vulnerable to being killed by humans Likelihood of retaliation Social and economic differences also impact motivation to hunt lions in reaction to livestock losses. People who have lost a higher proportion of their livestock to depredation (often those with smaller farms to begin with) as well as those owning livestock for the purpose of sale as opposed to traditional or subsistence reasons have been found to report a higher willingness to retaliate. Both higher proportional losses and keeping livestock for sale increase the value of cattle and therefore increase the financial incentive to kill suspected predators. Likelihood to retaliate has also been shown to be influenced by social factors such as religion and culture Reducing conflict Due to the complex social, economic, and ecological aspects of human-lion conflict, it is recommended that mitigation strategies be adaptable and situation-specific. Specific actions such as providing guards to monitor predators and protect cattle, corralling livestock at night, providing compensation and restoring natural prey densities may reduce conflict in some areas. Focusing on unique conservation programs that take into account factors such as culture and religion, type of livestock owned, and reason for owning livestock may also be helpful.

Kaufman cited CAIR's numerous ties to Hamas and extreme statements and actions perpetrated by Elkarra, himself. Boxer ‚Äúexpressed concern‚Äù about some past statements and actions by CAIR, and some law enforcement officials asserted that CAIR ‚Äúgives aid to international terrorist groups.‚Äù Neither CAIR nor any of its leaders have ever been indicted nor convicted of any crime. This revocation was strongly criticized by several organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union and the California Council of Churches. As a result of the controversy Boxer created, Basim received hate mail, including a death threat, since the controversy erupted. Similarly, in 2010, Ami Bera who was running for a U.S. congress seat, returned $250 of campaign donations to Mr. Elkarra after questions about CAIR's affiliations. Bera was criticized because he \\"succumbed to the growing national hysteria about Islam in America and the NRCC's fear-mongering, in particular.\\" On April 25, 2015, Ami Bera announced his endorsement for Basim Elkarra's campaign for the Twin Rivers School Board seat.

In 2012, IceFrog, the developer of DotA and Dota 2, honored BurNIng by naming his signature hero Anti-Mage after him in the original Dota game. In September 2018, he founded a new team called \\"Team Aster\\". Dota Burning started playing Dota professionally in 2008, and bounced around various teams before joining EHOME in 2010. EHOME would win 10 championships in 2010, including a dominating performance at Electronic Sports World Cup 2010 where the team didn't drop a game against some of the best Dota teams in the world. In the beginning of 2011, Burning and teammate Zhou \\"KingJ\\" Yang left EHOME to join Team DK. 2011 proved to be another big year for Burning, winning 9 championships. Dota 2 After not receiving an invite to the first edition of The International, Team DK switched over to Dota 2, and received an invite to the 2012 edition of The International. Team DK finished 4th, losing to eventual finalists Natus Vincere in the winner's bracket, then eventual champions Invictus Gaming in the loser's bracket. Burning announced before The International 2013 that he would retire after the tournament was over. At The International 2013, they managed to avenge last year's loss to Invictus, but were sent to the loser's bracket by eventual champions Alliance, then knocked out by Malaysian squad Orange Esports, finishing tied for 5th place. Burning did not retire after the tournament as he had planned, but the team would have to be rebuilt around him as everyone else on Team DK was removed from the team. After signing top players, including those from other regions outside of China such as and Mushi, Team DK had what was regarded as an all-star roster and started off 2014 by finally winning an offline tournament, winning the WPC ACE Dota 2 League 2013, with a 4-3 win over Invictus in the finals on New Year's Day. Team DK would win 2 more offline tournaments, as well as several online tournaments heading into The International 2014. At The International 2014, Team DK would finish 4th, losing to Evil Geniuses in the winner's bracket, then fellow Chinese team Vici Gaming in the loser's bracket. After The International 2014, Burning announced his retirement. In December 2014, Burning formed a team named Big God, which included several well-known veterans.

The game is an homage to 1990s first-person shooter video games, such as Doom and Quake, advertised as to have \\"bleeding edge graphics and gameplay\\", citing the year 1996. It was released worldwide on May 9, 2017.  Gameplay  Strafe is a first-person shooter with roguelike elements. There are four stages containing 2 or 3 levels each (depending on game mode), all of which are semi-procedurally generated. Upon loading into each zone, the map is generated by pulling a set of rooms from a pool and arranging them randomly. The enemies, upgrades, and merchants among other assets are also randomized and placed within the zone. Upon death, upgrades will be lost and levels will be re-arranged once more, but the player may be able to access teleporters to unlocked stages from the hub spacecraft. The fourth stage features an additional boss level that is not procedurally generated. From the hub spacecraft, the player chooses a primary weapon at the beginning of each run from a shotgun, a machine gun or a railgun. Each weapon has a primary and secondary fire method, with power-up items allowing the weapon to become much more powerful. A variety of weapons can be picked up within the levels when dropped from enemies, which generally have limited ammo and can be thrown when empty for additional damage. Merchants appear, from whom the player can buy upgrades. The game features a dynamic blood splatter system. Environmental effects such as acid and fire appearing from enemies or destruction of objects are a further obstacle and adds gameplay depth, where damaging pools of acid can be nullified by covered it in the blood of enemies. Enemies range from zombies, to robots and aliens. Players are rewarded for playing the campaign with tokens that can be used to unlock 25 \\"modifiers\\" that can be activated at the start of a run to significantly alter the gameplay. For example, by replacing all weapons in the game with rocket launchers, or by scrambling the placement of enemy types outside of their usual stages. In addition to the main campaign, there are alternate game modes: MURDER ZONE (survival mode), STRAFE ZONE (daily skill challenge), and SPEED ZONE (weekly speed challenge).  Plot  The unnamed player character is a \\"scrapper\\", a space explorer who collects materials to use as currency. An unknown party sends them on a scavenging mission to a ship known as Icarus on the far reaches of the known universe. However, once the player arrives on Icarus, they find that something on-board has gone awry, and must combat a deadly alien threat.  Development  The game had a successful crowdfunding campaign, reaching $207,000 of a $185,000 goal on Kickstarter. The Kickstarter campaign video parodies over-the-top video game commercials of the 1990s. The video was well-received, the game's designer Thom Glunt attributes his experience in commercial and video production to its success. Though the video was humorous, Glunt stresses that Strafe is not a comedy game, \\"It's a balls-to-the-wall straight-up action game.\\" Strafe was featured at the 2015 Games Developers Conference with a playable demo. Strafe development continued after the game's official release with several major updates. The Millennium Edition was released October 2, 2017 and added mutators, challenge modes, the ability to save runs, and additional campaign content. The Gold Edition was released May 9, 2020 and added a New Game Plus mode, as well as a long list of bug fixes, balance tweaks, and optimizations. Reception Strafe received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. GameSpot awarded Strafe a score of 8 out of 10, saying \\"Strafe wears its influences on its sleeve but stands on its own as a fun, intense, and fast-paced shooter with distinguishable charm.\\"  References   External links  * Category:2017 video games Category:Crowdfunded video games Category:Devolver Digital games Category:First-person shooters Category:Indie video games Category:Kickstarter-funded video games Category:MacOS games Category:Linux games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Science fiction video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Unity (game engine) games ","title":"Strafe (video game)"},{"id":"46211625","text":"Tobin Im(born Jan 7, 1961) is a scholar of public administration and a professor at the Graduate School of Public Administration at Seoul National University.

In sponsored search n bidders compete for the assignment of k slots. Each slot has an associate click- through rate, the click-through rates are decreasing from top to bottom. The GFP mechanism asks each bidder for a bid. Then the highest bidder gets the first slot, the second-highest, the second slot and so on. On each click the highest bidder pays his bid on the first slot, the second highest bidder pays his bid on the second slot, and so on. The GFP mechanism was the first mechanism to find application in sponsored search, replacing the \\"flat fee\\" and \\"per-impression\\" model that was the standard. Overture adopted the GFP mechanism in 1997, and provided service to Yahoo! and MSN. Although very successful initially, bidders quickly learned how to manipulate the mechanism. Bidding patterns exhibited a characteristic saw-tooth pattern, and the mechanism need not possess a (pure) Nash equilibrium. These deficiencies lead to the replacement of the GFP mechanism in practice, and the adoption of alternate auction designs. Recent work by Hoy et al. and D√ºtting et al. shows that the deficiencies of the GFP mechanism can be ascribed to its bidding interface, and that adopting a more expressive bidding interface guarantees the existence of an efficient Nash equilibrium under complete information as well as an efficient Bayes-Nash equilibrium under incomplete information.

Cardwell participated in the Battle of Rio San Gabriel at the Rancho Paso de Bartolo and the Battle of La Mesa in January 1847. California's First State Assembly Following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the Gold Rush of 1849 took Cardwell to Sacramento, where he was a partner in the business of Cardwell, Brown & Co. on J Street, between 2nd and 3rd Streets. There is evidence that he had a minor acting career, as well. His business acumen, together with his military service, led to his election to the very first California State Assembly, headquartered in San Jose, California, in late 1849. He introduced a joint resolution in relation to the pay of judges of the Supreme Court of California. Civic service After his term in the assembly, H. C. Cardwell moved to Los Angeles and worked as a clerk at William Wolfskill's ranch. He later served the city as water steward in 1854‚Äì1855. His good name was used to endorse political candidates and professionals. Early California agriculture H.C. Cardwell made several important contributions to early California agriculture. As an employee and later son-in-law of William Wolfskill, Cardwell helped cultivate and farm vast ranchos in the Los Angeles area. He grew oranges, grapes, peaches, pears, apples and olives. As early as 1853, Cardwell was shipping thousands of pounds of produce via the Port of San Pedro. He successfully planted chestnut trees and was somewhat of a legend for his \\"mammoth\\" 21.5 pound sweet potatoes. He is credited with introducing \\"heretofore unknown\\" seedling strawberries to southern California in January 1856. He had a reputation for experimenting with and improving crops in southern California. References Category:1859 deaths Category:Year of birth uncertain ","title":"H. C.

It was designed by James Furnival and built in 1873; it was extended in 1924 to a design by Lange Leopold Powell. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Sunday school class in the old Cleveland Court House, ca. 1871 St. Paul's Church of England, Cleveland, ca. 1905 This small brick church was constructed in 1873‚Äì1874 for the Anglican congregation in Cleveland, on land donated in 1870 by George Thorn of Ipswich. Prior to this, services were held on the verandahs of the former Court House (c.1853) (now Ye Olde Court House Restaurant) and the Grandview Hotel (c.1852). St Paul's was the first Anglican church constructed at Cleveland. St Andrew's Church, at nearby Ormiston, was constructed , but remained a private chapel for the use of the Hope family and employees, until transferred to the Anglican Church in 1882. The Cleveland church was designed by Brisbane architect and engineer James T. Furnival, and was erected at a cost of nearly ¬£500. The first service was held in 1874 and the church was consecrated on St Paul's Day (25 January), 1876. The first resident minister was appointed in 1877, and boundaries to the Parish of Cleveland were defined in 1878. In 1898 the exterior walls, which were probably face brick work, were rendered. Asbestos roofing slates were substituted for the original wooden shingles in 1908, and an earlier weatherboarded and buttressed spire was replaced by the present structure in the same year. In 1924, as a golden jubilee project, a porch designed by Brisbane architect Lange Leopold Powell was added, and some work was carried out to the foundations. It is not known if the weatherboard vestry removed in the early 1980s from the southern elevation of the chancel was part of the original construction. A free standing belfry, a picket fence and Norfolk Island pines have been removed as well. In the 1980s, a new church was constructed adjacent to the 1873‚Äì1874 building. The earlier building is now principally a venue for youth activities.  Description  View from the Cross Street, 2015 This is a small brick church, now rough-cast and limewashed. Seen framed by spreading figs from the road approaching Cleveland Point, it is a simple gothic buttressed form with a heavier polygonal porch. An octagonal spire stands on the southwest end of the ridge of a steep gabled roof, clad in asbestos cement slates. The spire, with pinnacle clad in smaller slates, has a lancet louvered vent to each face. All windows in the original church and chancel are lancet shaped. There are four tall windows each side of the nave. The northeast chancel, attached under a smaller gable, is end-lit by three stained glass windows. A smaller window is placed under the main gable, centrally above the chancel roof. In the southwest wall there are windows either side of the porch, and a smaller one, central above the porch roof. The porch, in rendered concrete, has more elaborate stepped buttresses, a hardboard ceiling and a concrete floor. A rectangular window, facing southwest, incorporates a pair of dominant lancet panes. The position of the former vestry roof, on the southeast, is indicated by marks on the external render. A timber door leading from the church to the former vestry has been removed and the opening brick-filled and rendered. Internally, moulded timber trusses span a nave of four bays. Moulded plaster surrounds frame the chancel arch. Walls are of white-washed plaster, with recent varnished vertical boarding around the walls of the nave. The ceiling is of beaded tongue and groove boarding. The stone font, now painted, stands outside in a paved area, with low garden walls and planting contemporary with the adjacent 1980s church.  Heritage listing  St Paul's Anglican Church was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. St Paul's Anglican Church, Cleveland, erected in 1873-74, is important in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history, being associated with early European settlement at Cleveland, and with post- separation expansion of the Anglican Church in Queensland. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. It is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a small, gothic-styled brick church of the 1870s. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. It exhibits aesthetic characteristics valued by the community, including its picturesque form and its setting in the streetscape.

Monster parents are known to raise their children with a \\"bizarre blend of authoritarianism and overprotectiveness.\\" They are overprotective by virtue of making numerous requests and complaints to their children's teachers, which themselves are often viewed as \\"unreasonable\\". The phrase originated in Japan and gained widespread usage in Hong Kong. Origins The phrase \\"monster parent\\" was originally a Wasei-eigo term coined by Japanese educator Y≈çichi Muk≈çyama (:ja:ÂêëÂ±±Ê¥ã‰∏Ä) in 2007.ÊïôÂÆ§„ÉÑ„Éº„Ç¶„Çß„Ç§, p.9, August 2007 It was subsequently made known in Asia by a Japanese TV drama also called Monster Parents. The show depicted a series of observations from real life situations in schools where parents of students often interfered in school affairs and teachers' teaching. The show was broadcast from July 1, 2008, to September 9, 2008. By 2011, the phrase had also seen widespread usage in Hong Kong as well. Hong Kong Education system Under the Hong Kong education system, most students are required to attend interviews that assess their academic and extracurricular achievements in order for them to attend academically prestigious schools. Most schools will select a group of academically gifted interviewees to attend. Because of this, parents have been observed to pressure their children to excel in school and extracurricular activities in order to get into their selected school. Once their children get into these schools, the parents may continue to voice complaints in order to make their concerns heard. Development Monster parents exhibit an authoritarian parenting style, forcing children to follow tight schedules with little time to manage their daily lives and routines. They are highly-protective in taking care of their children and are seen as restrictive and controlling. They often spoil their children in order to get them to do tasks that the parents wish them to do. According to Global Voices, Hong Kong has been a knowledge-based economic system since the early 2000s. This puts pressure on parents to ensure that their children excel in early childhood and gain acceptance into prestigious schools. The rise of monster parents has been thought to be caused by a decline in birth rate in recent years. Children are also coming from other parts of China, often called \\"cross-border students\\", and attending schools that only Hong Kong children were originally allowed to attend. Traits Monster parents are often identified as meeting four criteria, according to many that come in contact with them. They are first identified as having an intense need to control their children. This causes the children to develop an inability to think for themselves. Next, they often force their children to take part in activities that they do not necessarily like. This includes taking extra classes on top of their normal ones, and participating in extracurricular activities that they are not interested in. Third, monster parents look at academics before anything else regarding their children. If their children do poorly in school, monster parents blame it on everything but the children. Lastly, monster parents think that their children are right in everything they do. According to them, they can do no wrong. Japan Naoki Oji, an education critic and former professor at Hosei University, mentions this \\"monster parents' phenomena\\" in a report based on a survey about monster parents in Japan (2007). He suggests that the construction of closer relationships between schools and community for better mutual understanding will be a solution to this problem since the lack of communication between teachers and parents is responsible for it. The survey was conducted in 2007 and number of respondents is 1247. The ratio of man and woman is 31.0% (man) against 68.6% (woman). 12.3% of them are parents and most of the rest are who work in education or education-related occupations. He categorizes the monster parents in several types and analyses their psychological elements to be so. 1) Overparenting/Over interference type The parents in this category who believe in children-centered policy demand excessive requests to teachers. For instance, \\"report me how many times my child raised his/her hand in the class.\\" The centralization of parents' attention on single child will explains this as a result of lower number of children. Effects on children Social effects Monster parents often interfere in their children's personal life and tend to cosset them. As a result, these children often end up developing anti-social personality traits and attitudes and tend to be overly-reliant on their parents. A commonly-used term in Asia to describe this phenomenon is \\"prince/princess sickness\\". These children have also been seen to exhibit tendencies towards aggression and violence to get their way, according to some researchers. Psychological effects Monster parents tend to be very overprotective of their children and often coddle them for most of their childhood. Because of this, children of monster parents often grow up to exhibit bad behavior and narcissistic personality traits. Monster parents also place a great deal of pressure on their children to excel in school in order to be admitted into more prestigious schools. This places an enormous amount of pressure and stress on the children. Children have to handle a significant workload at school, which may be too intense for them to deal with. They are constantly expected to expand their knowledge and skills. Children of monster parents often feel depressed and disappointed in themselves if they fail to meet the expectations of their parents. This anxiety can build up in the children and cause severe mental illness. It may even lead to suicide. Consequences There are foreseeable influences caused by monster parenting style. It may affect children's academic developments and their future careers as well. With the monster parenting style, it is believed that the parents may have extremely high expectations about their children's academic achievements. Indeed, children may appear to start feeling the pressure when they start failing to reach the high hopes and expectations of their parents while academic stress arises. Generally, the lack of independence may influence the children's future career as there are no opportunities for them to practice and learn before entering the workplace. A good deal of how one parents is shaped by how they were parented. It is reasonable to assume that monster parenting style is a vicious cycle and becomes a long-term social issue. Parents wield enormous clout in the development of their children, as they are who the children look up to and learn from. Parenting patterns are passed down from generation to generation. Thus, excessively protective parenting style may influence more and more generation until there is an alternative parenting style to replace it.

VinylPlus is a ten-year, industry-wide voluntary commitment to develop more ecologically responsible ways to produce, use and recycle PVC. The programme aligns with the principles and targets of the UN‚Äôs Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the circular economy. VinylPlus includes all European PVC industry sectors: resin and additives producers, as well as plastics converters and recyclers. It covers the EU-28 plus Norway and Switzerland. VinylPlus is included in the Rio+20 Registry of Commitments, and is a member of the Green Industry Platform, the global partnership led by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and the United Nations Environment Platform Programme (UNEP). VinylPlus is also registered as a partner on the UN Partnerships for SDGs platform where it is recognised as fulfilling the SMART criteria.  History  VinylPlus succeeded Vinyl 2010, which was the European PVC industry's first voluntary commitment. Vinyl 2010 was set up in 2000 around the principles of Responsible Care adopted by the European chemicals industry in the 1980s . Its programme aimed to shift the PVC industry to a more sustainable model by improving recycling and substituting hazardous additives. At the same time, the European Union also started addressing environmental concerns about plastics, notably developing the Waste Framework Directive (EU Directive 2008/98/EC), which laid down key EU recycling rules. Vinyl 2010 also set up a monitoring committee, which was kept upon the creation of VinylPlus. The committee was designed as an independent verification of the programme's activities, and includes representatives from the European Commission, the European Parliament, trade unions, consumer associations and academia.  Recycling  One aspect of the programme is to improve recycling figures. VinylPlus sets public recycling targets that it publishes online and in an annual progress report. VinylPlus accredits Recovinyl to helping with recycling. Recovinyl was set up by VinylPlus in 2003, and is an industry-wide platform that gathers European recyclers and converters.  The VinylPlus Sustainability Forum  VinylPlus organises an annual forum: The VinylPlus Sustainability Forum. The first one took place in Istanbul in 2013. The event aims to encourage dialogue on sustainability by assembling representatives from the PVC industry, policy makers, consumer groups, retailers, architects, designers, recyclers and NGOs. The themes from past forums have been: * 2013: Smart, Sustainable and Inclusive Growth for Europe and Beyond * 2014: Enhancing the Value of Partnerships * 2015: More Vinyl, Less Carbon * 2016: Smart Vinyl For Our Cities * 2017: Towards Circular Economy * 2018: Meeting Societal Needs *2019: Accelerating Innovation.  Governance  VinylPlus's management Board represents all European PVC industry sectors: resin and additives producers, as well as plastics converters. The Monitoring Committee offers guidance and advice, while ensuring an independent evaluation of the initiatives undertaken in the Voluntary Commitment. The Monitoring Committee currently includes representatives from the European Commission, the European Parliament, trade unions, consumer associations and academia, as well as representatives from the European PVC industry. The Monitoring Committee's stated goal is to ensure VinylPlus's transparency, participation and accountability.

Graffiti were incised into the stucco of interior walls, floors, and benches, in a wide variety of buildings, including pyramid-temples, residences, and storerooms. Graffiti have been recorded at over 50 Maya sites, particularly clustered in the Pet√©n Basin and southern Campeche, and the Chenes region of northwestern Yucat√°n. At Tikal, where a great quantity of graffiti have been recorded, the subject matter includes drawings of temples, people, deities, animals, banners, litters, and thrones. Graffiti were often inscribed haphazardly, with drawings overlapping each other, and display a mix of crude, untrained art, and examples by artists who were familiar with Classic-period (c. 250‚Äì950 AD) artistic conventions.Hutson 2011, pp. 405‚Äì406. Maya graffiti are usually difficult to date. Many have been attributed to the Late Classic (c. AD 550‚Äì830) and Terminal Classic (c. 830‚Äì950) periods, although earlier graffiti are known. Some graffiti have been attributed to squatters in the Postclassic period (c. 950‚Äì1539). Graffiti are not integral decoration of the structures where they are found; rather, they are additions to pre-existing features, and lack formal organisation. Usually they bear no obvious relationship to any neighbouring graffiti, and they can be found randomly scattered on walls, floors, and benches. Some examples are found in obscure locations, such as dark corners and narrow passageways.Andrews 1980, p. 2. Maya graffiti are a poorly studied topic; early explorers and investigators regarded them as a curiosity with little bearing on Classic Maya culture. In the late 19th century, Teoberto Maler became the first person to record Maya graffiti. A few 20th-century scholars made efforts to record additional examples of graffiti. By the later part of the 20th century, graffiti had been recorded at San Clemente, Chichen Itza, Hochob, Holmul, Nakum, Santa Rosa Xtampak, Tikal, and Uaxact√∫n. Geographical extent Graffiti have been recorded at sites across the entire Maya area. In the R√≠o Bec region of Campeche,Demarest 2004, p. 133. Patrois 2013, p. 433. in the southern Yucat√°n Peninsula, the exceptional preservation of standing architecture has resulted in the preservation of a considerable amount of graffiti. R√≠o Bec graffiti are found in all classes of masonry residences, from simple single-room structures to multi-room palaces.Patrois 2013, p. 433. An early 21st-century survey of the R√≠o Bec region discovered 464 graffiti in just 15 of the buildings surveyed. Subject matter Ancient Maya graffiti portray a wide variety of themes from ancient Maya life, from the everyday to high ceremony, and are now regarded as an important source providing insight into ancient Maya society; subjects appear to be those witnessed by the artist. There are a large number of geometrical and abstract designs among Maya graffiti, and some scribbles. Among those examples that represent an identifiable subject, there is wide variation. Designs include whole human figures, anthropomorphic figures, human heads, buildings, deities, human sacrifice, animals (including birds, insects, and snakes), ceremonial ballcourts, patolli boards, and hieroglyphs. Usually each graffito is unrelated to surrounding designs, although in rare instances they can form a larger scene. A notable example of this is at Tikal Temple II; it depicts a scene of human sacrifice. A couple of procession scenes are depicted in buildings at Tikal, and some group scenes are known from R√≠o Bec. The most commonly represented subjects are human figures and heads.Andrews 1980, p. 6. At R√≠o Bec, warlike imagery is lacking, although there are scenes of human sacrifice.Patrois 2013, p. 445. At R√≠o Bec, complex representations of ceremonial scenes form compositions that can measure up to in length. Much R√≠o Bec graffiti is concerned with the elite residents, but additional graffiti, apparently added by squatters after the residences were abandoned, incorporate new subject matter that included mythological beings and female imagery.Patrois 2013, p. 434. Graffiti varies widely in quality, from crude drawings described variously as childlike or cartoonish, to skillfully executed renderings of human figures and animals that are of comparable quality to formal Classic Maya art. Most examples fall somewhere between the two in terms of quality.Andrews 1980, p. 8. Recognisable content in graffiti generally falls within those topics associated with Classic period Maya art.Andrews 1980, p. 19. Authorship Zoomorphic graffiti at La Blanca, Pet√©n. Incised lines overwritten in black for clarity. Early opinions on Maya graffiti were that they represented the crude scrawls of Postclassic squatters in Classic-period ruins. Later investigators, such as George F. Andrews, regarded graffiti as folk art produced by the Classic Maya elite in their own residences and workplaces.Andrews 1980, pp. 2‚Äì3. Three pairs of graffiti found both at R√≠o Bec and Holmul (sites separated by over ),Andrews 1980, p. 14. with similar quality, and technique, possess such similarity in design, down to the smallest details, that they are almost certain to be the product of the same untrained Late Classic artist.Andrews 1980, pp. 13‚Äì14. The three designs found at both sites consist of a seated person in a canopied litter being carried by two porters, an intricate geometrical symbol, and a seated figure blowing a wind instrument.Andrews 1980, p. 13. Preliminary studies indicate that most ancient Maya graffiti were executed by members of the Late Classic elite class, in their own residences and workplaces, and that most of the authors of graffiti were not trained artists.Andrews 1980, p. 16. The restricted geographical extent of the majority of Maya graffiti seem to indicate that the practice became socially accepted within the Maya aristocracy, and was transmitted between sites by the Maya elite. At R√≠o Bec, such is the abundance and differing quality of graffiti that all inhabitants, both adults and children, may have inscribed graffiti during the period of inhabitation. Arguments for a Postclassic date for graffiti at Classic period sites are mainly based on the quality of graffiti, which does not correspond in most cases to that of formal Classic Maya art. Theories attributing a Postclassic origin to such graffiti are based on the idea that it was produced by squatters who intended to desecrate Classic period ruins.Andrews 1980, p. 17. Although much R√≠o Bec graffiti was produced during residential occupation, additional graffiti appears to have been inscribed by squatters after abandonment. Technique Maya graffiti were scratched onto the targeted surface using some kind of pointed tool. Stucco surfaces at Maya sites are extremely hard, and incising graffiti was technically difficult. Basic lines and curves were relatively easy to mark, but complex curves and delicately etched lines were difficult to produce. The nature of the medium is such that mistakes are non-correctable; lines could not be erased, only added. Nonetheless, there are a large number of competently executed drawings. Purpose The purpose of ancient Maya graffiti is a matter of debate. Opinions vary from them being a desecration of their containing building, to instructive drawings, personal records, and byproducts of magic. Most graffiti with an identifiable subject appear to relate to elite activity.Andrews 1980, p. 15. Graffiti of patolli gameboards are almost always found on horizontal surfaces, indicating that they were used to play the game.Andrews 1980, p. 16. Mayer 2009, p. 26. Haviland and Haviland applied a neuropsychological model to the interpretation of graffiti at Tikal and argue that from 66% to 90% of graffiti at the city conform to what would be expected from art produced during a trance state.Haviland and Haviland 1995, p. 307. Dating Ancient Maya graffiti are difficult to date, since they could have been added at any time since completion of the building where they are drawn.Andrews 1980, pp. 8‚Äì9. However, a number of graffiti have been excavated in sealed contexts, where they were drawn on early structures that were later completely covered by later buildings. At Tikal, this has resulted in the secure dating of graffiti to the Preclassic (c. 2000 BC ‚Äì 250 AD), and Early to mid-Classic periods (c. 250 ‚Äì 600 AD). Most graffiti at Tikal are contained in structures that date to the Late to Terminal Classic. Some examples of graffiti at R√≠o Bec and Uaxact√∫n may pre-date the Late Classic.Andrews 1980, p. 9. There is debate as to whether graffiti found in Late Classic structures were created by their Classic period inhabitants, or whether they were added in the Postclassic period. In the Central Acropolis of Tikal, benches were placed in two structures sometime between 650 and 750 AD, partially or wholly covering pre-existing graffiti. This would indicate a date no later than the early 8th century. The style and subject matter of additional graffiti not obscured by the addition of the benches indicate that they were roughly contemporaneous with the covered examples. Similarly, at R√≠o Bec, graffiti was found to be sealed by later building modifications. At Uaxact√∫n, incised graffiti were also painted red; the excavator interpreted this as signifying that the graffiti were created by the original residents, rather than later squatters or passers-by.Andrews 1980, p. 10. At Tz'ibatnah, in northeastern Pet√©n, a Late Classic structure was likewise sealed under later architecture;Kov√°ƒç 2012, p. 196. this contained a great number of graffiti associated with the elite occupants of the site.Kov√°ƒç 2012, pp. 197, 201. In the majority of examples, where graffiti are not sealed by building modifications, it is not possible to confidently assign a date. However, there is no securely dated evidence of Postclassic graffiti being added to Late Classic structures.Andrews 1980, p. 12. Footnotes References : (1980) . : (2004).

The founder is Bahman Mirza Qajar (1810‚Äì1884), younger brother of Mohammad Shah Qajar and formerly prince regent and governor of Azerbaijan 1841‚Äì1848. In the last quarter of the 19th century, the family was divided into a Russian branch, serving the Tsar, and recognised in 1886 with the titles of Prince Persidskii and Princess Persidskaya styled \\"His Serene Highness\\" in the Russian Empire by the Tsar. As well as into a Persian branch in Tehran at the Shah's court, holding the traditional Persian title of shahzadeh (\\"prince\\").Adenin Remy: Almanach de Bruxelles: \\"The Qajar Dynasty\\" (internet 2015). Bahman Mirza used for himself and his mature sons the more familiar style of navvab (\\"highness\\"). Many of Bahman Mirza's male offspring were high-ranking officers in the Imperial Russian Army and stayed in the Tsar's service until the October Revolution at Tiflis, Shusha, Ganja and Baku. Many of them served in the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic during the short independence from Russia 1918‚Äì1920. With the Soviets coming to power and annexing Azerbaijan, many of Bahman Mirza's sons were executed or fled to Iran. Historic background The royal rule of succession of the Qajar dynasty is male primogeniture by a Qajar princess. This special addition means that not automatically the eldest son succeeded his father but the eldest son born by a Qajar princess. All other sons are legitimate but morganatic and have no right to succeed.Heribert Busse: History of Persia during the Qajar Rule, p. 106.This order was set as legal act with the constitution of 1906 with the supplement of the mother's Iranian descent. This fact caused in the first half of the 19th century troubles within the fruitful imperial family. The eldest princes, often powerful governors and their father's favorites did not automatically accept their younger brothers or nephews superior status. Bahman Mirza was the 4th son of Abbas Mirza by his cousin and chief wife Aisha, daughter of Mohammad Khan Qajar Davalu. Abbas Mirza was the 4th son and designated heir apparent of Fath Ali Shah by his chief wife and queen Assiyeh I, daughter of Fath Ali Khan Qajar Davalu. When Abbas Mirza died 1833 before Fath Ali Shah, his eldest son Mohammad Mirza became the new crown prince and Bahman Mirza was the next younger brother. Mohammad Shah suffering from grave illness was a weak monarch, hence Bahman Mirza as well as the foreign powers Great Britain and Russia insisted in his regal rights although Mohammad Shah had already an infant son by a Qajar mother, who was proclaimed crown prince in 1835, had still a bad health but was meant to be next ruler as Nasir al-Din Shah. Thus, Bahman Mirza wanted to execute the office of acting vicegerent of Azerbaijan, viceroy for his brother and regent for his infant nephew. In 1847 Bahman Mirza fell out of royal favor due to political intrigues at court and went in 1848 into exile to Russia. He first moved to Tiflis and in 1853 to Karabakh. The family lived there at Shusha where they hold real estates and a large summer palace. Many family members served at the Russian imperial court of Sankt Peterburg and became popular figures in the later Republic of Azerbaijan. In 1872 one of Bahman Mirza's sons arranged with his cousin Nasser al-Din Shah and the family was rehabilitated in Iran and invited to return to Tehran. Bahman Mirza refused to go back but some of his children did. Hence, the family was divided into a Russian branch, serving the Tsar, and recognised in 1886 with the titles of Prince Persidskii and Princess Persidskaya styled ‚ÄúHis or Her Illustrious Highness‚Äú in the Russian Empire by the Tsar. As well as into a Persian branch in Tehran at the Shah's court, holding the traditional Persian title of shahzadeh (‚Äúprince‚Äù). Bahman Mirza used for himself and his mature sons the more familiar style of navvab (‚Äúhighness‚Äù). The Bahmani children and grandchildren were sent to European schools and got the best education. And many of Bahman Mirza's male offspring were high- ranking officers in the Imperial Russian Army and stayed in the Tsar's service until the October Revolution at Tiflis, Shusha, Ganja and Baku. Many of them served in the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic during the short independence from Russia 1918‚Äì1920. With the Soviets coming to power and annexing Azerbaijan, many of Bahman Mirza's sons were executed or fled to Iran. Bahman Mirza issued 61 children - 31 sons and 30 daughters, only 50 survived infancy. So he became the father of the Bahmani-Qajars with the lines of the Qajars of Azerbaijan named Bahmanov, Bahmanoglu and Ghajar as well as the Bahman and Bahmani family in Iran. While his daughters, who often had been taken part in many charity events married into all famous families of Azerbaijan like the Akhundov, Badalbeili, Vezirov, Tagiev, Shahtakhtinski, Beglarbegov, Mehmandarov, Abbasovo, Muradov and Mirzov families.Genghis Kadjar: Kadjars, p. 94 f. Coat of arms The family coat of arms based on the old Persian Lion and Sun emblem, the royal symbol since the Seljuq time in the 13th century. In 1785 Agha Mohammad Khan adopted the emblem and under Fath Ali Shah in 1803 it became symbol of the land as well as of royal house, with a crouching lion. In 1871 the current version was published.

Early life He was a subordinate and ghilman (slave commander) of a Seljukid prince (a cousin of Malik-Shah I). After his superior was killed in a battle, upon the request of the citizens, he moved to Ahlat (now a district center in Bitlis Province of Turkey, then an important Islamic cultural center) where he fought against Marwanids and captured the city on behalf of the Great Seljuk Empire in 1100.Prof. Ya≈üar Y√ºce-Prof. Ali Sevim: T√ºrkiye tarihi Cilt I, AKDTYKTTK Yayƒ±nlarƒ±, ƒ∞stanbul, 1991 p 155 Beylik S√∂kmen captured the nearby settlements to the north and west of the Lake Van and increased his power of influence.

Mohammad in turn granted Ahlat to S√∂kmen as an ikta in 1110. Thus this date is now considered to be the date of the establishment of Ahlatshahs Beylik. In some documents the name of the beylik is \\"S√∂kmenli\\" referring to S√∂kmen. Death In 1111, he was invited to participate in a Seljukid campaign. With his troops he joined the main Seljukid army. But during the siege of Turbessel (a castle near Gaziantep) he died in August 1111. His coffin was sent to Ahlat.

It lies in the south Shropshire Hills, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The limestone escarpment Wenlock Edge is about south-east, and the parish lies on Wenlock Shale. Hughley Brook, which runs north-east along the western edge of the village, is the parish border with Church Preen (to the west of Hughley) and Kenley (to the north).A P Baggs, G C Baugh, D C Cox, Jessie McFall and P A Stamper, 'Hughley', in A History of the County of Shropshire: Volume 10, Munslow Hundred (Part), the Liberty and Borough of Wenlock, ed. C R J Currie (London, 1998), pp. 337-347 British History Online, accessed 18 March 2015. History The village was known in medieval times as Legh, Leye or Lee, and the lords of the manor took its name. They are thought to be descendants of Aelfric, father of Eadric of Wenlock who was probably Eadric the Wild, an important figure at the time of the Norman Conquest. It is thought that the village acquired its distinguishing name by the end of the 13th century, after Hugh of Lee, who became lord of the manor in 1225 and died between 1271 and 1283. In the late 18th century most houses in Hughley were still timber- framed; later, houses were built or rebuilt with locally made brick. The resulting appearance of the village was distinct from the stone-built houses of upland settlements in the area. It is thought the parish has never had a pub. Legend On the parish boundary at Wenlock Edge is a rock outcrop, known as Ippikin's Rock, over a cave. There is a legend that Ippikin was a knight of the 13th century, leader of a band of robbers whose base was the cave, and were finally trapped there by falling rock.Legends: Ippikin, the robber knight of Wenlock Edge BBC Shropshire 24 August 2005, accessed 20 March 2015.

It was built in the 13th century, of limestone rubble with sandstone ashlar dressings. The nave and chancel are structurally undivided. Two lancet windows in the north of the nave are from this period. There was modification in the 14th century, when all the other windows were built. Inside, there is a late-medieval richly decorated rood screen. There is a timber-framed belfry built about 1700. New pews were installed in 1842. The church was restored in the 1870s by Richard Norman Shaw; this included creating the trussed rafter roof and restoring the west window. There was restoration about 1900 which included reflooring the nave.

It had its world premiere on 17 March 2015 at South by Southwest and stars Henry Rollins as an immortal, cannibalistic loner who has withdrawn from society to protect both himself and others. A miniseries continuation of the film is currently in development. Filming for He Never Died began in November 2013 in Toronto and concluded in December of the same year. The film was released on various video on demand platforms as well as on DVD and became available worldwide on Netflix on March 18, 2016. Synopsis Jack has developed a routine for his life that he follows in order to repress his urge to engage in cannibalism. He spends most of his time in his apartment and avoids human contact other than regular trips to a local diner, mass at a nearby church, bingo games, and to the hospital, where he purchases donated blood from a hospital intern, Jeremy. Upon returning home from one trip, Jack is confronted by mobsters Steve and Short, who are looking for Jeremy. Jack's routine is further interrupted by a phone call from his ex- girlfriend, Gillian, asking him to find their adult daughter, Andrea, who tried to contact him earlier that day. Unhappy, Jack agrees to locate Andrea, but stresses that he wants no further contact with Gillian. He finds Andrea and takes her with him to the diner he frequents, where she meets Cara, a waitress with a crush on Jack. While Jack slowly bonds with Andrea he sees visions of an old man with a goatee, wearing a porkpie hat, and also manages to foil Steve and Short's attempt to kidnap Jeremy. Jack is surprised when he discovers that Andrea can also see the man, as previously only Jack could see him. Out for vengeance, Short and Steve try to murder Jack, only for Jack to kill Short by tearing out his throat with his bare hands, which he then eats, giving in to his craving for human flesh. Afraid that he'll do the same to Andrea, Jack forces her to leave the apartment. Shortly afterwards Jack kills and eats an obnoxious neighbor. Later, he walks around the city trying to pick fights with various strangers, all of whom refuse to reciprocate his aggression. Eventually, he comes across three young men spoiling for a fight, culminating in him killing one or more of them. Jack ultimately receives a phone call from the mobsters, who inform him that they have killed Gillian and kidnapped Andrea and will kill her if he does not surrender. Jack tries to confront Alex, a local crime boss, and the man he believes is responsible, only for Alex to deny that he had anything to do with the kidnapping. Upset, Jack goes to the diner, where he bribes Cara into helping him save Andrea by offering her a million dollars. She discovers that Jack is actually the Biblical figure Cay'in (Cain). Jack ultimately discovers the reason why the mobsters were after Jeremy: he had borrowed a large sum of money to pay off his student loans, without repaying it. He also learns of Andrea's whereabouts and goes to rescue her. Alex reveals that he kidnapped Andrea as revenge for Jack killing Alex's father, a mobster Jack once worked for. Just as Jack is about to murder Alex, the man with the goatee arrives, prompting Jack to angrily confront him over his many previous murders. Jack demands to know why the man won't let him die. Jack ends up choosing to spare Alex in favor of helping Andrea seek medical attention. Before leaving with Cara and Andrea, Jack promises Alex that one day he will see the goateed man. After they have left, the goateed man appears to the very injured Alex, greeting him with a resonant otherworldly-sounding voice. Cast Miniseries In October 2014 it was announced that 108 Media were shopping the rights for a miniseries version of He Never Died, which would further expand the film's story and history of the central character Jack. Director Krawczyk is set to return as the director for the miniseries and Rollins is attached to return to portray his character Jack. Reception Critical reception for He Never Died has been mostly positive. Film School Rejects and Dread Central both wrote positive reviews for the film, and Film School Rejects wrote that it was \\"laugh out loud funny thanks almost exclusively to Rollins‚Äô delivery and reaction shots, but the acts of violence and character details are just as entertaining.\\" We Got This Covered was more mixed in their review, which stated that \\"He Never Died is a genre movie that refuses to let itself be defined, but the film's guessing game grows tiresome as the questions only continue to mount.\\" Soundtrack * He's Got The Whole World In His Hands by Charlie Kim * (If) You Want Trouble by Nick Waterhouse * Hate In My Heart by Inger Lorre & the chiefs of infinity * Quiet Man by Judy Klass Band (demo song) recently cut by Mary Resek * Melancholy Man by The Moody Blues * Sellout by Sri * I'm Gonna Count My Sheep by Missouri Jazz Band (uncredited song during Bingo scene) Sequel/remake In April 2019, the director, Audrey Cummings, surprised audiences by releasing a new film titled She Never Died starring Olunike Adeliyi, which he describes as a \\"remake\\" of his original film. However, critics more often refer to the film as a proper sequel, generally heaping praise both upon the lead actor and the film.

Thus, the style of the piece is distinctly more chromatic and dissonant than its predecessor, while also employing seemingly desultory changes in mood and form. In the program notes to the concerto, Rouse remarked: Rouse also declared of the concerto, \\"...it is a work that has taken me longer to compose than has any other score of mine to date.\\" Reception Calum MacDonald of BBC Music Magazine described the piece as \\"...mercurially changeable in direction and material, playing irreverent games with the number 12, and with a burlesque embedded pastiche ‚Äòmini-concerto‚Äô whose appearances are determined (shades of John Cage!) by rolls of the dice.\\" Reviewing the world premiere of the concerto, John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune praised the clarinet writing as \\"test[ing] the virtuosity of the soloist\\" and the composition as a whole for \\"dar[ing] the audience to hang on tight as it takes them on the high-energy roller-coaster ride of their lives.\\" Rhein further commented: References Category:Concertos by Christopher Rouse Category:2000 compositions Rouse Category:20th-century classical music Category:Compositions for symphony orchestra Category:Music commissioned by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra ","title":"Clarinet Concerto (Rouse)"},{"id":"46212389","text":"Oshawa, Minnesota may refer to: *Oshawa, Cass County, Minnesota *Oshawa, Nicollet County, Minnesota ","title":"Oshawa, Minnesota"},{"id":"46212424","title":"Modern pentathlon at the 2016 Summer Olympics ‚Äì Qualification"},{"id":"46212447","text":"Vladimir Vragov (; 2 October 1945, Urgench ‚Äî 4 June 2002) ‚Äî was a Russian/Soviet mathematician and scientist.

From then until 1991 he was a member of the Community of the Resurrection. He was then resident Chaplain to the Community of St John the Baptist until his appointment as Dean. He, alongside Archdeacons Jonathan Williams and Ambrose Mason, raised grievances - which they termed \\"concerns about the well-being\\" - against Bishop of Monmouth Richard Pain. Despite an internal investigation which determined that there was insufficient evidence to proceed with a formal disciplinary tribunal and finding \\"there was no case to answer\\", the three men remained unsatisfied. Tonge, Williams and Mason then wrote a letter to the Archbishop John Davies and all Welsh bishops expressing how unhappy they were with the outcome. A process of mediation was then put into place, they withdrew from this in December 2018 when a press release from the Church in Wales seemed to confirm the breakdown-in-relationships rumours.

He was also a prior and an administrator at Stift Neukloster, Wiener Neustadt, Austria, where he died on April 2, 1945.  Life  Alois Rabensteiner entered the Cistercian Order in 1898 at Heiligenkreuz Abbey where he was given the name Alberich. He made his perpetual Religious vows on June 1, 1903, and was ordained into the priesthood on July 25, 1903. After serving as chaplain at St. Valentin, he was sent to Stift Neukloster in Wiener Neustadt, where he founded the Sodality of Our Lady together with the future Father Eberhard Steinbauer. Father Alberich Rabensteiner was the parish priest in Sulz, Upper Austria, from 1910 to 1915. In September 1916 he became the parish priest for Gaaden. He was drafted for military service in 1916 at the height of World War I and acted as military chaplain in Wels, Upper Austria and later at the Italian Front in South Tyrol and at Bukovina. In 1918 he was appointed as prior and administrator of Stift Neukloster as well as the Parish Priest of Neukloster. From 1922 onwards, he became dean of Wiener Neustadt and from 1934 became dean of Weigelsdorf, Ebreichsdorf. In the Martyrology Sancrucense, Rabensteiner is described as a religious firebrand, with a deep Marian spirituality. His desk calendar, which he used to record his thoughts, contains the entry \\"amo nesciri et pro nihil reputari‚Äú (I love being unknown and to be thought of as nothing). Death and Martyrdom In the spring of 1945, Wiener Neustadt was subject to heavy air raids by the Allied Forces, killing many people. Although a large number of people fled from the city, Rabensteiner stayed and continued his duty. During Holy Week, as the Red Army advanced on Wiener Neustadt, Rabensteiner and the few remaining monks celebrated Mass in the sacristy or the basement of the already heavily damaged monastery. On Easter Monday, April 2, the Red Army entered the city after heavy artillery bombardment and fights with the remaining German forces. Rabensteiner removed the bodies of fallen German soldiers from the street beside the monastery to prevent them being run over by Russian tanks. The following events cannot be reconstructed with certainty. One source, Adolf H√∂ggerl,A. H√∂ggerl, Sancta Crux, 61 (2000), Nr. 117, 202‚Äì206 who had left Rabensteiner and based his later report on a secondary source, wrote that a Russian Officer had violently objected to the removal of the bodies and had rushed into the church shouting for the priest. A young woman fled screaming from the church, and Rabensteiner, who had heard her screams, quickly ran into the church. The other version of eventsJ. Mandak, Sancta Crux, 56 (1995), Nr. 113, 164‚Äì173 (a written testimonial by Sr. M. Burgharda) claims that Rabensteiner hid a young woman, who was being pursued by a Russian soldier, in the kitchen and was seen talking to the soldier, who then followed him inside. Rabensteiner was found shot dead in front of the high altar of the church. He was buried by permission of the Russian Commandant in the cloister of Stift Neukloster. Father Alberich Rabensteiner is named as a martyr in the Austrian martyrology of the twentieth century.J. Mikrut (ed.): Blutzeugen des Glaubens. Martyrologium des 20.

Seizures are abnormally excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain. They are the most frequent neurological problem in the nursery, and often require evaluation and treatment in a neonatal intensive care unit. Seizures in the neonatal population can be categorized into acute symptomatic seizures and genetic or structural causes. Diagnosis relies on identification of the cause of the seizure, and verification of an actual seizure activity by measuring of electrical activity with electroencephalography (EEG). Treatment depends on the cause of the seizure, but often includes pharmacologic treatment with anti-epileptic drugs. Considerable debate about the longterm consequence of a neonatal seizure exists between data and deductions reached through animal experimentations and those obtained through clinical investigations. The main conflicting issues are whether seizures in newborns can plant the roots for epileptogenesis and cause long-term deficits. Fewer than half of the affected infants develop seizures in later life. Such neonatal seizures are considered self-limited, and thus the term neonatal epilepsy is not used to describe these seizures. It has been estimated that approximately 15% of neonatal seizures represent an epilepsy syndrome. The incidence of neonatal seizures has not been clearly established, although an estimated frequency of 80-120 cases per 100,000 neonates per year has been suggested. The incidence of seizures is higher in the neonatal period than at any other time of life, and most often occurs in the first week of life. Signs and symptoms Seizures in the neonatal population often present differently than in other age groups due to brain immaturity. Electroclinical seizures are defined by evidence of seizure activity on electroencephalogram as well as clinical signs or symptoms. However, in neonates there may be no clinical movement abnormality (either because the seizures are subclinical or because they were not witnessed), so the only symptom may be abnormal level of consciousness. When motor movements due occur, they cannot be suppressed by gentle restraint by a nurse or caregiver. Classification systems have been developed based on neonatal seizure motor manifestations, summarized below. For more information about seizure classification, see page seizure types.  Focal or multifocal clonic  Clonic seizures are defined by repetitive contractions of groups of muscles, typically of the limbs or face. These may involve one group of muscles (focal) or the multiple groups of muscles (multifocal). An isolated focal seizure can move or spread, and can even alternate from one side of the body to the other. Due to the neonatal brain's immaturity, the typical Jacksonian march may not occur. Focal seizures typically have very close correlates on EEG, with measurable EEG abnormalities with each seizure movement. The rhythm of the clonic movements and EEG abnormalities is usually slow, at 1-3 movements per second.  Focal tonic  Focal tonic seizures are characterized by sustained muscle contraction of muscle groups, and thus often appear as abnormal posturing of a single limb or eye deviation.  Generalized tonic  A focal tonic seizure can generalize, or the first seizure can occur as a generalized seizure, or seizures that impair the neonate's level of consciousness. Generalized tonic seizures typically appear as symmetric and sustained posturing of limbs in either an extensor or flexor distribution. Generalized tonic seizures often manifest with tonic extension of the upper and lower limbs and also may involve the axial musculature in an opisthotonic fashion. Generalized tonic seizures mimic decorticate posturing; the majority are not associated with electrographic seizures.  Myoclonic  Myoclonic movements can either be caused by seizures or be benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, a common mimicker of seizures in neonates (see differential diagnosis, below). Myoclonic seizures are characterized by isolated and fast contractions of muscle groups. These movements typically occur in the limbs or face, and do not repeat. Stimulation can provoke myoclonic seizures.  Subtle  Some clinicians use the term subtle seizures to describe seizures if there is an absence of distinct tonic or clonic movements but presence of abnormal eye movements, stereotyped lip smacking, or apneic events. Benign Benign neonatal seizures are not classified as epilepsy.  Causes  Neonatal seizures have a number of causes. Determining the cause of a confirmed seizure is important because treatment and prognosis vary based on underlying etiology of the seizure. In contrast to seizures that occur in other age groups, seizures that occur during the neonatal period are most often caused by the following processes: * Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy: This is the most common cause of seizures in the neonatal period. * Perinatal Arterial Stroke: Arterial stroke can be caused by intra-arterial thrombosis or embolism from the heart or placenta. The risk for perinatal arterial stroke increases with a variety of conditions that occur due to material factors during birth (oligohydramnios, chorioamnionitis, placental abnormalities) or neonatal factors (clotting disorders, congenital heart defects) * Intraventricular hemorrhage * Central Nervous System Infection: CNS Infection are found in 3-10% of neonates who seize, though exact incidence varies between studies. Bacterial meningitis and viral meningoencephalitis are most prevalent, though fungal infections can occur. * Congenital central nervous system malformations: Lissencephaly, polymicrogyria, and tuberous sclerosis are specific entities known to cause seizures due to defects in brain tissue development. Since prognosis is poor and often these disorders are genetic, identification of this etiology is of utmost importance to be able to counsel parents appropriately. * Inborn Errors of Metabolism: Inborn errors of metabolism can cause physiologic conditions that result in seizures. These errors are genetic and often are accompanied by other symptoms such as lethargy, poor feeding, and low tone. Diagnosis often involves specific laboratory tests of metabolic products as well as genetic tests. Several classification systems exist for seizures caused by inborn errors of metabolism, one of which separates causes into problems with neurotransmitter metabolism, energy production, and biosynthetic substances crucial for brain formation. * Electrolyte abnormalities: Metabolic abnormalities such as hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, and hypocalcemia can manifest as seizures. *Substance-Related: Neonatal abstinence syndrome occurs when maternal drug use before birth results in a fetal withdrawal syndrome. Substances include alcohol, cocaine, narcotics, tricyclclic antidepressants, or other sedatives. Seizures can be prevented from occurring if the symptoms of withdrawal are recognized and treated early.  Diagnosis  A normal amplitude integrated EEG trace in a term infant who is several days old. The amplitude-integrated trace is in the top half of the screen displaying left- and right-sided traces. There is a normal baseline and upper limit, sleep-wake cycling, and no seizures. Seizure activity in a neonate is difficult to diagnose, as many seizures have no clinical correlate. Altered level of consciousness is often the only clue, and in a neonate this can be difficult to accurately assess. Thus, diagnosis relies on attempting to directly measurement the abnormal electrical activity in the brain with electroencephalography (EEG). EEG is combined with video recording of the infant to correlate any seizure movements with EEG recordings. There are several modes of EEG that are commonly used in the NICU to diagnose neonatal seizures. Conventional continuous multichannel conventional EEG is the gold standard for diagnosis of epileptiform activity, but requires expert interpretation. Newer amplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) (also termed cerebral function monitoring, or CFM) allows easier monitoring of brain activity, but may not allow identification of short duration, low amplitude, or very high frequency seizure activity. Often, both modes are displayed concurrently.  Determining the cause  Since many causes of seizures can be rapidly reversed and longterm sequelae prevented, evaluation of underlying cause is of utmost importance. Evaluation for infection (with blood counts, lumbar puncture, and empiric treatment with antibiotics) often occurs during EEG monitoring. Blood glucose and electrolyte testing can identify metabolic problems that can be corrected. Further testing includes evaluation for genetic causes and other more rare metabolic causes. Brain injury such as cerebral infarction or hemorrhage can be evaluated with imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and brain ultrasound to avoid unnecessary radiation exposure.  Differential diagnosis  Infants can exhibit stereotyped movements that may be hard to distinguish from seizure activity. Since many of these non-seizure movements are not dangerous and require no treatment, differentiation from actual seizure activity is useful. Jitteriness is common in the neonatal period and is seen in upwards of 2/3 of neonates. It is characterized by a tremor that is especially prominent during sleep or periods of agitation. Gaze deviation or eye movements do not occur. Benign neonatal sleep myoclonus (BNSM) is another common movement that can be mistaken for a seizure. It is characterized by jerking limb movements only during sleep, and stop with waking of the infant. BNSM typically occurs later in infancy, but can occur during the neonatal period.  Treatment  Once diagnosis is made, the goals of management are to identify the cause of the seizure, stop the seizure activity, and maintain physiologic parameters such as oxygenation, ventilation, blood glucose, and temperature. Treatment greatly depends on the cause of the seizure. For example, infectious causes of seizures (meningitis, meningoencephalitis), are often treated with antimicrobials (antibiotic, antifungal, or antiviral medications). Similarly, electrolyte or glucose abnormalities are treated by repleting or lowering the offending electrolyte or sugar. If the cause of the seizures are unlikely to be easily or quickly corrected, once diagnosis of a seizure is made, the mainstay of treatment is pharmacotherapy with anti-epileptic drugs. A 2013 systematic review found that most practitioners use phenobarbital or phenytoin. This study found that phenobarbital has the safest side effect profile and longest history of use in neonates. Benzodiazepines are often used as second line treatment if treatment with phenobarbital does not result in clinical improvement. Research is ongoing on use of other anti-epileptics that are commonly used in older children and adults are safe or efficacious to use in neonates. Part of the challenge of anticonvulsant drug treatment during the neonatal period is that the immature excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter system results in few effective drug targets.  Outcomes  With earlier diagnosis and increasingly prompt diagnosis, mortality after diagnosis of neonatal seizures has decreased dramatically from an estimated 33% in the 1990s to around 10% in the 2010s. Underlying cause of the seizure remains the greatest predictor of ongoing seizures and neurologic problems later in life. Controversy remains with the extent of damage the seizures themselves cause. Clinician consensus is that frequent or intractable seizures (status epilepticus) leads to neuronal damage and are associated with later neurodevelopment problems. Developmental delay, cerebral palsy, and problems with vision and hearing are the most common poor outcomes following neonatal seizures. Severity of impairment ranges greatly and many infants develop normally once the initial seizure cause is treated. Studies have identified risk factors for poor outcomes after neonatal seizures. Infants that are premature, have hypoxemic ischemic encephalopathy, CNS infection, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, structural central nervous system defect, or severely abnormal EEG tracings tend to do worse than infants with focal strokes, transient metabolic issues (hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia), or clinical seizures without EEG abnormalities. Risk of epilepsy later during childhood is a common question asked by parents in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Unfortunately, the answer is rarely clear cut as it depends greatly on the underlying cause. For all infants with neonatal seizures regardless of cause, the rate of subsequent seizures during childhood is estimated between 10 and 20%. Infants who survive severe global HIE have the highest rate of epilepsy later in life.  Epidemiology  It is difficult to determine the incidence of seizures in the neonatal period. Estimations range between 1-5 per 1,000 live-births, though the actual rate of seizures during this period may be higher due to lack of accurate diagnosis of sub-clinical seizure activity without continuous EEG monitoring. Acute causes of seizures (hypoxemic ischemic encephalopathy, infection, intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, etc) are more common than first-episode of neonatal epilepsy syndromes. Seizures occur during the neonatal period at a higher rate than in any other period of life. Seizures in the developing brain are more common than in a mature brain for several reasons. First, the developing brain is hyperexcitable due to excess in excitatory glutaminergic neurons and immaturity of inhibitory gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) neurons. Preterm infants are at especially high risk for seizures for this reason.  Research directions  Since interpretation of continuous EEG monitoring requires a trained neurologist, automated interpretation software has been proposed. Algorithms and machine learning have been studied, however logistical and mathematic challenges remain.

He is considered one of the main renovators of modern Valencian poetry, with a similar role to that of Ausi√†s March or Joan Ro√≠s de Corella in earlier periods. Exhibition about the life and works of Estell√©s in Convento del Carmen (Carmen's Convent), Valencia, 2013  Biography  Vicent Andr√©s Estell√©s was twelve years old when the Spanish Civil War broke out. During its course, he trained to become both a baker and a goldsmith, and learned to write on a typewriter. The war had a profound impact on his work, in which death is a recurring theme. Estell√©s spent his teenage years in Valencia, where he developed an interest in literature. During that period, he was most influenced by Charles Baudelaire, Pablo Neruda, Paul √âluard, Cesare Pavese, and Walt Whitman, Catalan poets such as M√†rius Torres, Jacint Verdaguer, Josep Carner, Carles Riba, Santiago Rusi√±ol and Joan Salvat-Papasseit, as well as the Valencian poet Ausi√†s March and the Balearic poet Bartomeu Rossell√≥-P√≤rcel. In 1942, at the age of 18, Estell√©s moved to Madrid to study for a degree in Journalism. Three years later, he left to do his military service in Navarre. At the age of 24, he moved back to Valencia and became a journalist for the newspaper Las Provincias. He befriended Joan Fuster, Xavier Casp and Manuel Sanchis i GuarnerAutores: Vicent Andr√©s Estell√©s, in letrA, Catalan Literature Online (Open University of Catalonia) (Spanish). ‚Äì all three of them well-known Valencian writers ‚Äì and met Isabel, who would later influence his writings as well. In 1955 Estell√©s married Isabel. The couple had a daughter, who died when she was four months old. After the death, which Estell√©s recalled in Coral romput, death became a recurring theme in his works. In 1958 he became editor-in-chief of Las Provincias, only to be dismissed for political reasons in 1978,Una aproximaci√≥ a Vicent Andr√©s Estell√©s. thus being forced into early retirement at the age of 54. This allowed him to devote himself entirely to writing and engaging in a variety of cultural activities, such as art exhibitions. That same year, Estell√©s was awarded the Premi d'Honor de les Lletres Catalanes. In 1984 he was awarded the Premi d'Honor de les Lletres Valencianes. Estell√©s spent a few years in Benimodo, a municipality in the comarca of Ribera Alta, in the Valencian Community. During this period, he combined poetry with prose in his works. He received several awards in the 1990s, including the Premis Octubre.  Works  Graffiti quoting the first words of a famous poem by Vicent Andr√©s Estell√©s (Els Poblets, 2012) The works of Vicent Andr√©s Estell√©s, one of the most important Catalan-language poets of the 20th century, are diverse and extensive. Although he is better known for his poetry, he also wrote novels, plays, screenplays, as well as his memoirs. The main themes of his work are death and sex, and they are always dealt with from a popular, everyday, simple, direct, and even vulgar perspective.Su poes√≠a parte de unos elementos bien determinados: el mundo cotidiano y sus aspectos m√°s vulgares, el di√°logo con algunos autores predilectos (Ausi√†s March, Garcilaso, Horacio, C√°tulo y los poetas catalanes desde Carles Riba y Foix hasta Espriu y Ferrater) la vindicaci√≥n de un pueblo y de una lengua sometidos al silencio y, por encima de todo, la necesidad obsesiva de escribir para dejar constancia del mundo y de la experiencia del poeta, de catalogar la realidad en forma de palabras, y la exaltaci√≥n de las relaciones er√≥ticas como motivaci√≥n b√°sica de esta vida y √∫nico enfrentamiento significativo con la muerte\\". (Francesc Parcerisas, quoted in Reciclatge (Nivell superior), page 230. It is difficult to categorize his entire work. In fact, some works were reworked from books or private notes such as \\"Manuscrits de Burjassot\\" (the Manuscripts from Burjassot), \\"Can√ßoner\\" (Anthology) or \\"Mural del Pa√≠s Valenci√†\\" (Mural of the Valencian Country), from which he only published extracts or the poems he considered most appropriate. His first publications were \\"Ciutat a cau d'orella\\" (Whispered City) (1953), \\"La nit\\" (The Night) (1956), \\"Donzell amarg\\" (Bitter Youth) (1958) and \\"L'amant de tota la vida\\" (The Lifelong Lover) (1966), which are only a small selection of what he had written at that point. From the 1970s onwards, he published more frequently and received numerous awards. He published \\"Lletres de canvi\\" (Bills of Exchange)(1970), \\"Primera audici√≥\\" (First Audition) (1971), \\"L'inventari clement\\" (The Clement Inventory) (1971). In (1971) he published two major works: \\"La clau que obri tots els panys\\" (The Key That Opens All Locks) (which contained \\"Coral Romput\\" (Broken Coral)) and the best-seller \\"Llibre de les meravelles\\" (Book of Marvels), perhaps his most famous work. From that moment onwards, Estell√©s began to gain recognition and published his Complete Works, including \\"Recomane tenebres\\" (I Would Recommend the Dark) (1972), \\"Les pedres de l'√†mfora\\" (The Stones from the Amphora) (1974), \\"Manual de conformitats\\" (Manual of Conformities) (1977), \\"Balan√ß de Mar\\" (Swing of the Sea) (1978), \\"Cant temporal\\" (Temporary Singing) (1980), \\"Les homilies d'Organy√†\\" (Homilies of Organy√†) (1981) which includes \\"Coral romput\\", \\"Versos para Jackeley\\" (Verses for Jackeley) (1983), \\"Vaixell de vidre\\" (Glass Ship) (1984), \\"La lluna de colors\\" (Colourful Moon) (1986), y \\"Sonata d'Isabel\\" (Isabel‚Äôs Sonata) (1990). His most important prose works are \\"El coixinet\\" (The Little Cushion) (1988), his play \\"L'oratori del nostre temps\\" (The Oratory of Our Times) (1978), and his memoirs: \\"Tractat de les maduixes\\" (Strawberry Treaty) (1985), \\"Quadern de Bonaire\\" (Bonaire‚Äôs Notebook) (1985), and \\"La parra boja\\" (The Crazy Vine) (1988).  Aesthetics  The three levels of oppression that are evident in his works are the reason why Estell√©s's aesthetics have been described as \\"irate\\". * Personal oppression: He describes a vital situation in which persecution and humiliation are constant. This situation unavoidably requires being assertive and acting consequently. It shows love as a possibility of salvation and redemption. * Collective oppression: He describes a collective life characterized by economic misery, fear of being socially criticized, and a situation of ignorance devastating the people which he feels he belongs to. * National oppression: He describes a sense of despair ‚Äî a particular sensitivity caused by cultural, linguistic, and national abduction. He is sensitive to the Valencian people's fight to dignify their own culture. Some of his most frequently recurring topics are death, love and eroticism, hunger and political oppression, as well as daily life. Put together, these themes provide a considerable formal and tonal variety.  Recognition  In 1993, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Valencia.Acto de Investidura como Doctor ‚ÄúHonoris Causa‚Äù del Excm. Sr. Dr. Vicent Andr√©s Estell√©s. University of Valencia, 1993.  Awards  The most important awards he received are: * 1978, Premi d'Honor de les Lletres Catalanes (Catalan Literary Lifetime Achievement Award) awarded by the Generalitat of Catalonia. * 1982, Premi Creu de Sant Jordi awarded by the Generalitat of Catalonia. * 1990, Premi d'Honor de les Lletres Valencianes awarded by the Generalitat Valenciana. * 1992, Porrot d'Honor de les Lletres Valencianes de Silla. * 1994, Medalla de Oro al m√©rito en las Bellas Artes awarded by the Ministry of Culture of Spain after his death.  Statues and streets  In several towns in the Valencian Country, Streets have been named after Estell√©s. There is also a bronze statue in Emilio Castelar square, in Burjassot, Andr√©s Estell√©s's birthplace. This piece, showing him sitting on a park bench, writing on top of a pile of books, has suffered four loutish attacks. For instance, it was covered in blue paint and the arms of his glasses were broken. Likewise, extreme right blavers attempted to destroy a bust of Estell√©s that was put up in Burjassot in 1979.  Works set to music  Estell√©s is one of the most popular Catalan-language poets among musicians. His works have been set to music several times, mostly by Ovidi Montllor. Montollr's version of the poem \\"Els Amants\\" (The Lovers) is especially remarkable ‚Äî it has been performed live on many occasions. Other singers, singer-songwriters, or groups that have also set his works to music are Paco Mu√±oz, Celdoni Fonoll, Maria del Mar Bonet, Obrint Pas, Pau Alabajos, Remigi Palmero, Vicent Torrent, Miquel Lluis, Els pavesos, Lluis the Sifoner, and Esteve Ferre.

Prior to Alliance Trust PLC, Katherine served as chief investment officer and executive director of Morley Fund Management, now Aviva Investors, and prior to that, as chief investment officer of Aberdeen Asset Management PLC. In October 2015, a row with activist investors Elliott Advisors resulted in Garrett-Cox stepping down from the Alliance Trust board. The activist investors argued that the company's performance had been poor and that changes to the board were necessary. This row was slightly offset in April 2015 when Alliance agreed to appoint two of the three board member candidates recommended by Elliott, however ultimately, an agreement was in place to review the board situation in Autumn 2015. Garrett-Cox still occupies the position of chief executive at Alliance, and this move puts her back in a fund management role rather than a role running the wider business.

Urban planning is also referred to as urban and regional planning, regional planning, town planning, city planning, rural planning, urban development, physical planning, urban management or a similar combination in various areas worldwide Urban planning is a technical and political process that is focused on the development and design of land use and the built environment, including air, water, and the infrastructure passing into and out of urban areas, such as transportation, communications, and distribution networks. Traditionally, urban planning followed a top-down approach in master planning the physical layout of human settlements. The primary concern was the public welfare, which included considerations of efficiency, sanitation, protection and use of the environment, as well as effects of the master plans on the social and economic activities. Overtime, urban planning has adopted a focus on the social and environmental bottom-lines that focus on planning as a tool to improve the health and well-being of people while maintaining sustainability standards. Sustainable development was added as one of the main goals of all planning endeavors in the late 20th century when the detrimental economic and the environmental impacts of the previous models of planning had become apparent.. Similarly, in the early 21st century, Jane Jacob's writings on legal and political perspectives to emphasize the interests of residents, businesses and communities effectively influenced urban planners to take into broader consideration of resident experiences and needs while planning. Urban planning answers questions about how people will live, work and play in a given area and thus, guides orderly development in urban, suburban and rural areas. Although predominantly concerned with the planning of settlements and communities, urban planners are also responsible for planning the efficient transportation of goods, resources, people and waste; the distribution of basic necessities such as water and electricity; a sense of inclusion and opportunity for people of all kinds, culture and needs; economic growth or business development; improving health and conserving areas of natural environmental significance that actively contributes to reduction in CO2 emission as well as protecting heritage structures and built environments. Urban planning is a dynamic field since the questions around how people live, work and play changes with time. These changes are constantly reflected in planning methodologies, zonal codes and policies making it a highly technical, political, social, economical and environmental field. Urban planning is an interdisciplinary field that includes social science, architecture, human geography, politics, engineering and design sciences. Practitioners of urban planning are concerned with research and analysis, strategic thinking, architecture, urban design, public consultation, policy recommendations, implementation and management. It is closely related to the field of urban design and some urban planners provide designs for streets, parks, buildings and other urban areas.Van Assche, K., Beunen, R., Duineveld, M., & de Jong, H. (2013). Co-evolutions of planning and design: Risks and benefits of design perspectives in planning systems. Planning Theory, 12(2), 177-198. Urban planners work with the cognate fields of architecture, landscape architecture, civil engineering, and public administration to achieve strategic, policy and sustainability goals. Early urban planners were often members of these cognate fields though today, urban planning is a separate, independent professional discipline. The discipline of urban planning is the broader category that includes different sub-fields such as land-use planning, zoning, economic development, environmental planning, and transportation planning. Creating the plans requires a thorough understanding penal codes and zonal codes of planning. Another important aspect of urban planning is that the range of urban planning projects include the large-scale master planning of empty sites or Greenfield projects as well as small-scale interventions and refurbishments of existing structures, buildings and public spaces. Pierre Charles L'Enfant in Washington DC, Daniel Burnham in Chicago and Georges-Eugene Haussmann in Paris planned cities from scratched, and Robert Moses and Le Corbusier refurbished and transformed cities and neighbourhoods to meet their ideas of urban planning. History city planning in Germany was official government policy dating back to Nazi rule. August 1963.Hass-Klau, Carmen. \\"Motorization and Footpath Planning During the Third Reich.\\" The Pedestrian and the City. Routledge, 2014. There is evidence of urban planning and designed communities dating back to the Mesopotamian, Indus Valley, Minoan, and Egyptian civilizations in the third millennium BCE. Archaeologists studying the ruins of cities in these areas find paved streets that were laid out at right angles in a grid pattern.Davreu, Robert (1978). \\"Cities of Mystery: The Lost Empire of the Indus Valley\\". The World‚Äôs Last Mysteries. (second edition). Sydney: Readers‚Äô Digest. pp. 121-129. . The idea of a planned out urban area evolved as different civilizations adopted it. Beginning in the 8th century BCE, Greek city states were primarily centered on orthogonal (or grid- like) plans.Kolb, Frank (1984). Die Stadt im Altertum. M√ºnchen: Verlag C.H. Beck. pp. 51-141: Morris, A.E.J. (1972). History of Urban Form. Prehistory to the Renaissance. London. pp. 22-23. The ancient Romans, inspired by the Greeks, also used orthogonal plans for their cities. City planning in the Roman world was developed for military defense and public convenience. The spread of the Roman Empire subsequently spread the ideas of urban planning. As the Roman Empire declined, these ideas slowly disappeared. However, many cities in Europe still held onto the planned Roman city center. Cities in Europe from the 9th to 14th centuries, often grew organically and sometimes chaotically. But in the following centuries with the coming of the Renaissance many new cities were enlarged with newly planned extensions. From the 15th century on, much more is recorded of urban design and the people that were involved. In this period, theoretical treatises on architecture and urban planning start to appear in which theoretical questions around planning the main lines, ensuring plans meet the needs of the given population and so forth are addressed and designs of towns and cities are described and depicted. During the Enlightenment period, several European rulers ambitiously attempted to redesign capital cities. During the Second French Empire, Baron Georges- Eug√®ne Haussmann, under the direction of Napoleon III, redesigned the city of Paris into a more modern capital, with long, straight, wide boulevards. Planning and architecture went through a paradigm shift at the turn of the 20th century. The industrialized cities of the 19th century grew at a tremendous rate. The evils of urban life for the working poor were becoming increasingly evident as a matter of public concern. The laissez-faire style of government management of the economy, in fashion for most of the Victorian era, was starting to give way to a New Liberalism that championed intervention on the part of the poor and disadvantaged. Around 1900, theorists began developing urban planning models to mitigate the consequences of the industrial age, by providing citizens, especially factory workers, with healthier environments. The following century would therefore be globally dominated by a central planning approach to urban planning, not necessarily representing an increment in the overall quality of the urban realm. At the beginning of the 20th century, urban planning began to be recognized as a separate profession. The Town and Country Planning Association was founded in 1899 and the first academic course in Great Britain on urban planning was offered by the University of Liverpool in 1909.Fainstein, Susan S. In the 1920s, the ideas of modernism and uniformity began to surface in urban planning, and lasted until the 1970s. In 1933, Le Corbusier presented the Radiant City, a city that grows up in the form of towers, as a solution to the problem of pollution and over-crowding. But many planners started to believe that the ideas of modernism in urban planning led to higher crime rates and social problems. The Decline of Detroit is an example of the impacts of social planning on a large urban area. In the second half of the 20th century, urban planners gradually shifted their focus to individualism and diversity in urban centers. 21st century practices  Urban planners studying the effects of increasing congestion in urban areas began to address the externalities, the negative impacts caused by induced demand from larger highway systems in western countries such as in the United States. The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs predicted in 2018 that around 2.5 billion more people occupy urban areas by 2050 according to population elements of global migration. New planning theories have adopted non-traditional concepts such as Blue Zones and Innovation Districts to incorporate geographic areas within the city that allow for novel business development and the prioritization of infrastructure that would assist with improving the quality of life of citizens by extending their potential lifespan. Planning practices have incorporated policy changes to help address anthropocentric global climate change. London began to charge a congestion charge for cars trying to access already crowded places in the city. Cities are also prioritising public transit and cycling by adopting such policies. Theories Street Hierarchy and Accessibility Planning theory is the body of scientific concepts, definitions, behavioral relationships, and assumptions that define the body of knowledge of urban planning. There are eight procedural theories of planning that remain the principal theories of planning procedure today: the rational- comprehensive approach, the incremental approach, the transactive approach, the communicative approach, the advocacy approach, the equity approach, the radical approach, and the humanist or phenomenological approach. citing ) Some other conceptual planning theories include Ebenezer Howard's The Three Magents theory that he envisioned for the future of British settlement, also his Garden Cities, the Concentric Model Zone also called the Burgess Model by sociologist Ernest Burgess, the Radburn Superblock that encourages pedestrian movement, the Sector Model and the Multiple Nuclei Model among others. Technical aspects Technical aspects of urban planning involve the applying scientific, technical processes, considerations and features that are involved in planning for land use, urban design, natural resources, transportation, and infrastructure. Urban planning includes techniques such as: predicting population growth, zoning, geographic mapping and analysis, analyzing park space, surveying the water supply, identifying transportation patterns, recognizing food supply demands, allocating healthcare and social services, and analyzing the impact of land use. In order to predict how cities will develop and estimate the effects of their interventions, planners use various models. These models can be used to indicate relationships and patterns in demographic, geographic, and economic data. They might deal with short-term issues such as how people move through cities, or long-term issues such as land use and growth. One such model is the Geographic Information System (GIS) that is used to create a model of the existing planning and then to project future impacts on the society, economy and environment. Building codes and other regulations dovetail with urban planning by governing how cities are constructed and used from the individual level.Codes, rules, and standards are part of a matrix of relations that influence the practice of urban planning and design. These forms of regulation provide an important and inescapable framework for development, from the laying out of subdivisions to the control of stormwater runoff. The subject of regulations leads to the source of how communities are designed and constructed‚Äîdefining how they can and can't be built‚Äîand how codes, rules, and standards continue to shape the physical space where we live and work. Enforcement methodologies include governmental zoning, planning permissions, and building codes, as well as private easements and restrictive covenants. Urban planners An urban planner is a professional who works in the field of urban planning for the purpose of optimizing the effectiveness of a community's land use and infrastructure. They formulate plans for the development and management of urban and suburban areas, typically analyzing land use compatibility as well as economic, environmental and social trends. In developing any plan for a community (whether commercial, residential, agricultural, natural or recreational), urban planners must consider a wide array of issues including sustainability, existing and potential pollution, transport including potential congestion, crime, land values, economic development, social equity, zoning codes, and other legislation. The importance of the urban planner is increasing in the 21st century, as modern society begins to face issues of increased population growth, climate change and unsustainable development. An urban planner could be considered a green collar professional. Some researchers suggest that urban planners around the world work in different \\"planning cultures\\", adapted to their local cities and cultures. However, professionals have identified skills, abilities and basic knowledge sets that are common to urban planners across national and regional boundaries.

With scenery and costumes designed by Elizabeth Dalton, it was first presented as Der Widerspenstigen Z√§hmung by the Stuttgart Ballet at the W·πªrtembergische Staatstheater in Stuttgart on 16 March 1969.Zoe Anderson, \\"The Taming of the Shrew,\\" in The Ballet Lover's Companion (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 2015), p. 340. Background Cranko's ballet is a dance version of William Shakespeare's play The Taming of the Shrew (1590‚Äì1592). The story is a comedy about Petruchio's determination to subdue the irascible Katherine; he woos her, marries her, and makes her an obedient wife.William Shakespeare, The Taming of the Shrew, edited by Barbara A. Mowat and Paul Werstine (New York: Washington Square Press, 1992). Shakespeare chose his title to signify to his audiences that the play was about the marriage of a man to an ill-tempered woman given to scolding, nagging, and aggression. Such a woman, especially a wife, was known in the sixteenth century as a shrew, so called after a tiny rodent with a notoriously hostile and unpleasant nature.David Crystal and Ken Crystal, Shakespeare's Words: A Glossary and Language Companion (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 2002). A woman convicted in court for being a shrew was often punished in Shakespeare's day by being confined to stocks on the village green or repeatedly dunked in a nearby pond or lake.Frank Kermode, The Age of Shakespeare (Washington, D.C.: Folger Shakespeare Library, 2004). Scenario The setting is Padua, a city in northern Italy, not far from Venice. Three suitors‚ÄîHortensio, Lucentio, and Gremio‚Äîcome to Baptista's house to serenade Bianca, his younger daughter. Baptista declares that Bianca shall not marry until her older sister, Katherina, is wed. An ensuing rumpus is dispelled when Katherina angrily sends everyone packing. In a tavern, a tipsy Petruchio is robbed of his money. Hortensio, Lucentio, and Gremio offer to introduce him to an heiress. He accepts and determines to \\"wive it wealthily in Padua.\\" At Baptista's house, Petruchio asks for Katherina's hand. After a stormy courtship, she agrees. Bianca's three suitors press their case. Bianca favors Lucentio. The first act culminates at Katherina and Petruchio's wedding, where he arrives late and behaves outrageously. He carries off his bride without waiting for the festivities to begin. At Petruchio's house, the newly wedded couple are at supper, but he does not allow her to eat, protesting that the food is not good enough. She refuses to consummate the marriage and spends the night on the kitchen floor. Then, at a carnival, Lucentio tricks Hortensio and Gremio into marrying two ladies of the street, thus clearing his way to woo Bianca on his own. Petruchio's mockery and trickery continue to provoke Katherina. Eventually she surrenders, and they admit that they love each other. On the way to Bianca's wedding, Petruchio indulges in some whims, but Katherina has learned to humor him. At the wedding, Bianca treats her husband scornfully, but Katherina shows her how a wife is expected to behave. Left alone, she and Petruchio revel in their new-found love.William Shakespeare, The Oxford Shakespeare: The Taming of the Shrew, edited by H.J. Oliver (Oxford University Press, 2008).

While tortelli typically have a savoury filling, that of tortelli cremaschi is sweet and cannot be found elsewhere in Italy. Origins The tortelli cremaschi may have been born during the long Republic of Venice . In support of this theory there are at least two factors: the first is that nowadays it's a typical dish known only in the city of Crema, actually within the borders of the ancient territory of Crema which belonged to Venice. The second one due to the ingredients of the filling: amaretti biscuits, spices, candied fruit and raisins are all goods which came from the trades with the Orient, which were under the monopoly of the Venetians for centuries. The modern recipe dates from the end of the 19th century. Custom The tortelli represent, in Crema, the most important dish of a celebration; they are usually prepared for festivals, weddings or other family events; however they aren't Christmas or Easter food and virtually every village and every family has its own recipe, slightly different from the next.  Shape  Tortelli cremaschi, uncooked It appears that the shape of the tortelli is unique in Italian gastronomy: a small amount of filling is placed in the middle of a small circle of dough, which is then folded over into a half-moon, the edges superimposed by hand and pinched together to create five crests. In some villages, people make them in a square and use a fork to press them closed, but this does not conform to the tradition. The \\"cremaschi\\" of ancient times said that the use of the fork was used by countrymen to save money, in that there would have been no waste of dough. Ingredients The tortelli have a balance of flavors, with a sweet and spicy filling, while traditional pasta and condiments are savory, gelatinous and fatty. The 'secret' is due to the perfect balance between the quantity of the filling and the dough so as to maintain the harmony; they must be made with pasta and filling balanced in the correct proportions. They have to be formed in rather thick envelopes of pasta and cooked for a relatively long time, from 20 to 40 minutes. Egg pasta is not suitable here because, in cooking, it tends to lose the filling. Dough * Flour * Water (or milk) * Salt * One egg for each kilo of flour (the egg aids in the binding of the dough) To prepare the dough, one adds all the flour to lightly salted hot water and kneads until an elastic ball is formed; at the end of the kneading the colour should be a light grey. If desired one could use a pasta maker adding only one egg for each kilo of flour, and a spoonful of oil to give more elasticity to the mixture. Any recipe that uses more than one egg per kilo of flour is not considered traditional and does not work well. Filling * Amaretto biscuits crumbed (the \\"Gallina\\" brand is the only one favored by the \\"cremaschi\\") * Breadcrumbs, but only for drying an excessively moist filling. * Candied citrus peel * Nutmeg * \\"Mostaccini\\" spicy biscuits, typical of Crema * Egg yolks * Salt * Grated Grana Padano cheese * Grated lemon skin * Marsala * Mint candies (no more than four for each kilo of flour) * Raisin, soaked to soften Some people add meat or broth, but such don't belong to the traditional recipe. To prepare the filling, pour it in a mixing bowl and then add the crumbed amaretti biscuits, the softened and dried raisin, the crumbled Mostaccino biscuit, the grated mint candies, grated citrus peel, grated cheese, the egg yolk, the lemon skin, a bit of breadcrumbs, the Marsala and if necessary a bit of broth to make the mixture softer. Let it stand in the fridge for an entire day. The following day prepare the dough and let it rest in a wrapped in a cloth for about an hour; stretch it out to create circles, parcel out the individual filling portions and fold them into half moon shaped pockets of dough, minding to press the edges three times. Cook in salted boiling water stirring gently occasionally, to prevent the tortelli from sticking together Condiment *High quality butter, lightly warmed to melt or fried with sage; some people use uncooked or barely melted butter. Layer the tortelli in a wide soup tureen, wetting them with the condiment and adding the grated Grana cheese, let them rest for a few minutes before serving.

He was raised in Fife, Scotland, and now lives in Edinburgh, where he works as a GP. His books have won many prestigious prizes. Biography Born in Fife in 1975, Francis studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and joined the Emergency department at the old Royal Edinburgh Hospital. Having qualified as a physician, Francis spent ten years travelling on all seven continents. Francis spent time working in India and Africa, made several trips to the Arctic, and is said to have crossed Eurasia and Australasia by motorcycle. Francis was working at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh when he decided to undertake a 15-month position as the resident doctor with the British Antarctic Survey. He arrived at the Halley Research Station in Antarctica via the RRS Ernest Shackleton, a supply ship, on Christmas Eve, 2002, after a two-month voyage. Writings Francis's experiences eventually formed the basis for his second book, Empire Antarctica (2012); his first book, True North: Travels in Arctic Europe (2008), detailed his experiences travelling in Arctic Europe from Unst to Svalbard. His Adventures in Human Being (2015) won the Saltire Society Literary Award for non-fiction and was a British Medical Association (BMA) book of the year.London Review of Books, Vol. 39 No. 21 (2 November 2017), pp. 21‚Äì22 Retrieved 26 October 2017. Empire Antarctica was a shortlisted finalist for a number of book awards in 2013, including the Ondaatje Prize and the Saltire Prize, but received its most notable honour in November 2013 at the Lennoxlove Book Festival when it was named the 2013 Scottish Mortgage Investment Trust's Scottish Book of the Year. Francis has been contributing articles and reviews to The Guardian since 2010, the London Review of Books, and the New York Review of Books since 2013. In addition to book reviews, his contributions occasionally consisted of prose ruminations on medical topics such as stethoscopes and the human brain, an approach that led to his being commissioned by the Wellcome Trust to produce a collection of essays in this style.

Description and history The small town of Temple is located at the end of Maine State Route 43, northwest of Farmington, Maine. The Intervale School is set at the northern corner of the junction of Intervale Road and Day Mountain Road, a short way north of the village center. It is a simple single-story wood frame structure, with a side-gable roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. Its main facade is three bays wide, with sash windows in the two right bays, and the doorway in the left bay. To the right, is an attached passageway leading to a small shed with similar finish. The roof is topped by a small open belfry. The town of Temple was settled in the 1790s, in part by migrants from Temple, New Hampshire. In 1810, the town meeting authorized the construction of this building, and it was here that the 1811 town meeting was held. The building was used as a school until 1958, believed to be the longest use of such a building for academic purposes in the state. The building is now maintained by the local historical society.

Established in 1979, it documented and researched objects of Jewish art in ca. 700 museums, libraries, private collections and synagogues in 41 countries. Today, the center's archives and collections constitute the largest and most comprehensive body of information on Jewish art in existence. The CJA's research and documentation is included in the Bezalel Narkiss Index of Jewish Art. History The Center for Jewish Art at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem was established in 1979 by Professor Bezalel Narkiss, Israel Prize laureate, with an aim to document objects of Jewish art and produce a comprehensive iconographical index of Jewish subjects. The center was an outcome of Narkiss's iconographical research of medieval Hebrew illuminated manuscripts, which he initiated with Professor Gabrielle Sed-Rajna in 1974. The Index initially consisted of four sections: a Section of Hebrew Illuminated Manuscripts, of Sacred and Ritual Objects, of Ancient Jewish Art, and of Modern Jewish Art. Professor Bezalel Narkiss headed the CJA until 1991. The next director, Professor Aliza Cohen-Mushlin, established a fifth section for Jewish Ritual Architecture and Funerary Art. Under her leadership the CJA undertook many research expeditions to post-Communist Central and Eastern Europe, in order to measure endangered synagogues and tombstones in regions, which were previously inaccessible to western scholars. In addition, from 1994 CJA documented those synagogues in Germany which survived the Nazi regime and were not demolished in Kristallnacht. The documentation projects in Germany were done in cooperation with the Department of Architectural History at the Technical University in Braunschweig, headed by Professor Harmen H. Thies. In 1997 this cooperation was institutionalized as Bet Tfila Research Unit for Jewish Architecture in Europe. Publications * Jewish Art (in 1974‚Äì1985, Journal of Jewish Art) is an annual devoted to the research of Jewish art. Its editors were Bezalel Narkiss and Aliza Cohen-Mushlin; Professors Ziva Amishai- Maisels and Bianca K√ºhnel served as guest editors of two issues. * Rimonim (◊®◊ô◊û◊ï◊†◊ô◊ù) is a Hebrew journal on Jewish art, aiming at bringing the results of academic research to a wider Israeli audience. * In 1976-1994 the Center for Jewish Art published ten volumes of Jerusalem Index of Jewish Art as collections of card on Hebrew illuminated manuscripts, ritual objects and ancient Jewish art. * From 2007, Beit Tfila publishes a series of monographs on Jewish architecture and a series of smaller studies on individual Jewish buildings. The editors of both series are Aliza Cohen-Mushlin and Harmen Thies, and they are published by the Imhoff Verlag in English and German. Bezalel Narkiss Index of Jewish Art The Bezalel Narkiss Index of Jewish Art is a largest virtual Jewish museum in the word, which includes about 300,000 images from ca. 800 museums, libraries, private collections and synagogues in 41 countries, as well as architectural plans of ca. 1,500 synagogues documented in situ. The images are classified according to their iconographical subject, type of objects, origin, and date. The digitization of the Index is being undertaken in cooperation with the National Library of Israel and the Judaica Division of Harvard University Library.

The compact and easy-to-use design of some bin-fed batch plant models ensures they can be up and working within just an hour of arrival on site. Four off-loading legs enable the bin-fed batching plant to be loaded and unloaded from a truck without the use of a crane. During transportation the legs retract into the frame of the batching plant and during off-loading they open out into a width that allows the truck to drive away or move back underneath. Each unit has a conveyor belt to lift the raw materials, which folds away into the first aggregate bin. Bin-fed batch plants are fitted with load cells and digital display units with printers to enable constant control of raw materials. The unit is supplied cement from a Cement Silo, normally between the capacity of 30-100MT. Since these are much smaller batching plants, great care should be taken to ensure safety of the Cement Silos.

Fire  The fire reportedly started in a first floor cafe, next to the Admiral center. The building collapsed, trapping 25 individuals under the rubble. A security guard initially attempted to extinguish the fire himself, and there was a delay in calling for first responders. It affected an area of 4,000 square meters (43,000 square feet).  First responders  Five hundred riot police were sent to seal off the center and create a line around the building as business owners attempted to re-enter the building and save goods. A fire train and helicopter were also used in order to get the fire under control.  Victims  Kazan law enforcers reported that the number of injured by the fire had exceeded 30, with nineteen people being transported to the hospital and fourteen going to the doctors or hospitals on their own choice. On March 12 it was reported that based on reports by workers and relatives, five people were confirmed dead and 25 missing. By March 14, the number of deceased victims had risen to 15 with 17 more missing, the final death total of 17 was released on March 15 with eight foreign nationals being identified among the dead.

Serlo was appointed as abbot of the Augustinian house of Cirencester in 1131, which had been refounded in 1117 by King Henry I of England. Serlo was the first abbot of the newly refounded house. While abbot, Serlo secured the grant of the lands of Regenbald, a chaplain of King Edward the Confessor, to his abbey in 1133.

It is electrified by bottom contact third rail at 750 V DC and is used by the trains on line S25 of the Berlin S-Bahn. The line begins in Lichterfelde S√ºd station and branches on the outskirts of Berlin from the Anhalt Suburban Line. The line was opened to Teltow Stadt (Teltow town) in 2005. There were already plans for this line and an extension to Stahnsdorf in the period between the two world wars. History  The first plans for a connection from the Anhalt Suburban Line at Lichterfelde to the town of Teltow and the Cemetery Railway (Friedhofsbahn) in Stahnsdorf already existed in the 1920s. In the 1930s, the Nazis were planning an extensive reconstruction of the Berlin railway infrastructure, especially in the south of the city. This S-Bahn line was planned. Between central Teltow and Stahnsdorf, a freight line would also run parallel to it to provide a more direct connection from the Gro√übeeren marshalling yard via Stahnsdorf to Potsdam. Neither project was realised, but earthworks were constructed in several places. Provision was made for the planned line during the reconstruction of Lichterfelde S√ºd station up to 1943, including the building of two platforms. After the end of World War II and the subsequent division of Germany, these plans were not pursued, but the route (at least in part) was retained. After the re-opening of the S-Bahn to Lichterfelde S√ºd in 1998, there was growing interest in extending the line to Teltow. The ground- breaking ceremony for the extension of the line was carried out on 22 October 2003 and the line went into operation on 24 February 2005. In contrast to the original plans, the line was built as a single track and the construction of a station at Teltow-Seehof has not been implemented for the time being. In February 2014, the new Zugbeeinflussungssystem S-Bahn Berlin train control system was put into operation on the line. This replaced the existing mechanical train stop system.

It is prominently situated at the northern tip of Greening Island, which is set at the mouth of Somes Sound, the inlet dividing Mount Desert Island, between the villages of Southwest Harbor and Northeast Harbor. It was designed by the partnership of Fred L. Savage and Milton W. Stratton and built in 1895 for Joseph Gilbert Thorp and Anne Longfellow Thorp. The Shingle style house is an important surviving example of this collaboration, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history Greening Island is located off the southern coast of Mount Desert Island roughly midway between the villages of Southwest Harbor and Northeast Harbor at the mouth of Somes Sound, a long narrow inlet that divides Mount Desert Island into two large lobes. Raventhorp is located on of land at the northern tip of the island. The main house is set very near the tip, facing north. It is a large 2-1/2 story Shingle style structure, with a wraparound porch that has sunrooms enclosed in glass at its eastern and western ends. The porch has a shallow hip roof supported by clusters (twos and threes) of square columns. The main block of the house has a variety of gables, projections, and recessed sections typical of the Shingle style. The eastern facade has a prominent high rubble-stone foundation, and a projecting polygonal bay that rises through the main roof to a turreted roof of its own. The interior features extensive original woodwork, from paneling in the public spaces to cabinetry in the kitchen. Raventhorp is a significant surviving example of the collaboration of architects Fred L. Savage and Milton W. Stratton. Savage was a well-known architect based primarily in Bar Harbor who executed a number of designs for summer cottages and hotels on Mount Desert Island. From 1892 to 1898 he partnered with Stratton, about whom little is known. This summer house was built in 1895 for Joseph Gilbert Thorp and Anne Longfellow Thorp, he a prominent Boston lawyer and she the daughter of poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The house remained in the Thorp family until 1981.

He was the first SPD politician to hold this position.  Apprenticeship and work as an editor  A joiner by trade, after his apprenticeship Schmid spent a few years as journeyman until he settled in Munich, where he became a member of the ' (German Wood Workers Association). He also worked as an editor for the SPD affiliated newspaper M√ºnchener Post.  Political career  In 1899 Schmid became the first Social Democrat member of the City of Munich Magistrate. In 1907 he became member of the Second Chamber of the Bavarian Parliament. In a time of severe domestic disputes, a few weeks after the defeat of the Bavarian Council Republic, Schmid was elected to Lord Mayor of Munich on 26 June 1919, in which he became the first Social Democrat to hold the highest position in the city until 1924. Living conditions in Munich were determined at that time by strikes, hunger, economic difficulties, unemployment and party strife.  Achievements  Schmid's tenure was marked by efforts to improve the electricity and water supply. The further expansion of the middle Isar for energy production was initiated by him. Through the purchases of land areas in the source well area of the Taubenberg he secured Munich's water supply. Other major projects which he promoted or initiated were the tram workshop in Perlach and the St. Joseph retirement home in Mittersendling.  Inflation and arrests by the SA  Two unpleasant historical events happened during Schmid‚Äôs term in office. In 1923, due to the general economic crisis, the sharp decline in the value of money, resulting in inflation. Because of this many citizens were deprived of their last savings, causing many to fall into a state of misery and despair. The second event was the Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. Schmid was an important democrat and opponent of Adolf Hitler. On 9 November 1923, he was arrested during the putsch by the SA and barely escaped death by hanging.  Resignation and Honorary Citizen Award  On 31 December 1924 Schmid resigned from his position as First Mayor. On his 70s birthday, on 15 October 1931, he was named the 32nd Honorary Citizen of the City of Munich. A few months after the Nazis‚Äô seizure of power, Schmid died on 8 June 1933 in Munich.

This operator is an extension to SQL proposed by B√∂rzs√∂nyi et al. A classic example of application of the Skyline operator involves selecting a hotel for a holiday. The user wants the hotel to be both cheap and close to the beach. However, hotels that are close to the beach may also be expensive. In this case, the Skyline operator would only present those hotels that are not worse than any other hotel in both price and distance to the beach.  Proposed syntax  To give an example in SQL: B√∂rzs√∂nyi et al. proposed the following syntax for the Skyline operator: SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... GROUP BY ... HAVING ... SKYLINE OF [DISTINCT] d1 [MIN  MAX  DIFF], ..., dm [MIN  MAX  DIFF] ORDER BY ... where d1, ... dm denote the dimensions of the Skyline and MIN, MAX and DIFF specify whether the value in that dimension should be minimised, maximised or simply be different.  Implementation  The Skyline operator can be implemented directly in SQL using current SQL constructs, however this has been shown to be very slow. Other algorithms have been proposed that make use of divide and conquer, indices, MapReduce and general-purpose computing on graphics cards. Skyline queries on data streams (i.e. continuous skyline queries) have been studied in the context of parallel query processing on multicores, owing to their wide diffusion in real-time decision making problems and data streaming analytics.

He has stated that one of the things that prompted him to go into politics was the way he felt small businesses were treated by government during the recession of the late 2000s: \\"As a small business owner I definitely felt the impact of the recession. I personally felt that the government did not understand what it was like and then there was the added burden of increased regulation on top of that.\\" In January 2015 Matthew Engel of The Financial Times described Tracey as \\"a complete newbie, the sort of candidate who hardly happens these days\\" and \\"totally apolitical until seven years ago when he became increasingly incensed about the effect on his business of EU regulation and Labour indifference\\". Going into the 2015 general election Tracey campaigned on local issues, notably the George Eliot Hospital, the plans for the HS2 railway through North Warwickshire, road safety, protecting Warwickshire's green belt, supporting local schools, and the need for improvements to high-speed broadband. He also supported Conservative plans for a referendum on European Union membership. With a majority of 54 in the 2010 general election, Labour targeted North Warwickshire as a top priority seat, and bookies predicted that Labour's Mike O'Brien would retake the constituency from the Conservatives after losing it in 2010. However, Tracey secured an increased majority for his party, from 54 to 2,973, winning 20,042 votes, compared to 17,069 for O'Brien. The result represented a 3% swing away from Labour to the Conservatives. The majority increase for the Conservatives in North Warwickshire was largely prompted by a surge in support for the UK Independence Party (UKIP), which took votes away from the Labour Party in a traditionally working class area of former mining villages. UKIP, whose candidate for the constituency was William Cash, the son of Conservative MP Bill Cash, came third with 8,256 votes. First months in office Shortly after his election Tracey told the trade journal Insurance Age that he would promote small businesses, as well as involving himself in the All Party Parliamentary Group on Insurance and Financial Services, with a view to highlighting the impact financial regulations can have on small businesses. He was appointed co-chair of the group in July 2016, after the previous chair, Heather Wheeler, stood aside after being appointed an assistant Conservative whip. Tracey holds the position alongside Lord David Hunt. He was elected on to the Business, Innovation and Skills Select Committee in July 2015, alongside the Labour MPs Iain Wright (who became its chair), Paul Blomfield, Peter Kyle and Jo Stevens, Conservatives Richard Fuller, Amanda Milling, Amanda Solloway, Kelly Tolhurst and Chris White, and Scottish National Party MP Michelle Thomson. Tracey asked his first question in the House of Commons in June 2015, when he quizzed Junior Health Minister Sam Gyimah about childcare provisions. He gave his maiden speech to the House of Commons on 9 July 2015. Later in July he requested a Parliamentary debate on the issue of heavy goods vehicles parking on industrial estates and residential streets in his constituency, and called for future planning applications to make provisions for parking facilities for such vehicles. That month also saw Tracey establish his constituency office in Atherstone. In August, he gave his support to a joint Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) and Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) campaign aiming to highlight the potential financial consequences to those who do not take out travel insurance when travelling abroad. Tracey supports concerned groups in North Warwickshire which have campaigned against the construction of the High Speed 2 railway, which would pass through his constituency. In August 2015 he handed over a number of petitions to HS2 Ltd from local groups opposed to the project, as well as his own personal petition. He gave evidence to the House of Commons HS2 select committee in January 2016, raising concerns about the effect the railway may have on the villages of Kingsbury and Water Orton. However, Tracey was one of eight MPs barred from giving evidence to a similar House of Lords committee, established in 2016. The High Speed Rail (London‚ÄìWest Midlands) Bill Select Committee was set up to decide whether there should be changes to the project's detailed plans, but ruled that Tracey and other MPs could not give evidence because they would not be directly affected by HS2. In September 2015 he used a parliamentary debate to criticise the lenient sentences given to people convicted over fatal road accidents after a hit-and-run driver was sentenced to sixteen weeks imprisonment for failing to stop when he hit a student while driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs. He subsequently supported the Criminal Driving (Justice for Victims) Bill, introduced by Liberal Democrat MP Greg Mulholland. In September 2015 Tracey also joined Tamworth MP and fellow Conservative Christopher Pincher in giving his backing to a campaign calling for safety improvements at a notorious accident blackspot in his constituency. Tracey was one of 129 Conservative MPs to support a vote to leave the European Union during the 2016 European Union membership referendum. Following the result of the referendum, in which Britain voted to leave the European Union, Tracey welcomed the outcome, describing it as a \\"huge opportunity\\" for the UK. Tracey joined other Midlands Conservative MPs in paying tribute to Prime Minister David Cameron after he announced his resignation in the aftermath of the referendum. He gave his support to Andrea Leadsom in the subsequent Conservative leadership election to replace Cameron. In September 2016, Tracey wrote to the Electoral Commission calling for his constituency to be renamed North Warwickshire and Bedworth in the proposed 2018 review of Westminster constituency boundaries. He also urged his constituents to back the campaign: \\"I have always called my seat 'North Warwickshire and Bedworth' but would like the name formalised ‚Äì it is only fair and right to recognise Bedworth and its residents officially.\\" 2017 general election Tracey was selected as North Warwickshire's Conservative candidate again for the 2017 general election. He won the seat with 26,860, increasing his majority to 8,510. Personal life Tracey married his fianc√©e, Karen Mercer-West, two weeks after he was selected as the candidate for North Warwickshire, and the couple spent their honeymoon at the 2014 Conservative Party Conference. Karen Tracey served ten years in the Royal Air Force, seeing active service in the 1990‚Äì91 Gulf War. Craig Tracey is a founding Trustee of the Lichfield Garrick Theatre.

This game is typically played in teams in large indoor spaces or outdoor fields. Bubble football follows the same objectives and overall rules as regular football (i.e., teams compete to hit a ball into the opposing team's goal) with the added condition that each player must wear an inflatable bubble, similar to a water ball, around their upper torso. Bubble soccer is often played at corporate team building days, stag parties, bachelor parties, and birthday parties. There are also many variations of bubble football, such as bubble bowling or bubble sumo. Origin A bubble soccer match at Texas A&M; University‚ÄìCommerce in December 2014 Bubble football was first created in Norway by Henrik Elvestad and Johan Golden in 2011, when it made an appearance on their TV show, Golden Goal. The game was spread in the UK by Lee Moseley who self-financed. By 2014, the sport had reached New Zealand. Now in the US it is overseen by its governing body, the BBA. Shark Tank appearance On November 20, 2015, bubble football appeared on the American TV show Shark Tank. John Anthony Radosta, league commissioner of the National Association of Bubble Soccer (based in the United States), appeared on the show in an attempt to secure a deal with the show's panel of investors. While ultimately unsuccessful in his pitch, the appearance generated subsequent press coverage. Different scenarios When playing bubble football there are a number of alternative scenarios which can be played: * Bubble bowling: A group of pins stands at one end of the pitch while another player tries to run and dive at the group in an attempt to knock as many pins over as possible. * Bubble sumo: Two players try to push each other out of bounds, which is a circle drawn on the ground. * Bulldog: One player (the starting bulldog) tries to knock down as many players as possible, stopping them from getting from one end of the pitch to the other. Whoever gets knocked down then also becomes a bulldog.

In the 1860s it moved into the spectacular purpose-built hospital designed by Robert Lewis Roumieu in Victoria Park, Hackney, and then in the 1940s moved out of London to Compton's Lea, Horsham, West Sussex. Since 1959 it has been located in Rochester, Kent and today provides almshouse accommodation for Huguenot descendants.Website of the French Hospital, Rochester, Kent. Early years Affectionately known as La Providence from as early as the 1720s, the hospital for poor French Protestants and their descendants was one of the earliest foundations to improve the welfare of London‚Äôs needy immigrants, and one of the first in Britain to provide sympathetic care for the mentally ill. Golden Acre, Finsbury thumbrightThe French Hospital in England by Tessa Murdoch and Randolph Vigne The French Hospital, near Old Street, Finsbury (oil on canvas, artist unknown, c. 1860) In his will proved on 2 December 1708, Jacques de Gastigny, who had been Master of the Hounds to King William III, left ¬£1,000 to improve the pest-house to the north of Old Street in the parish of St Giles without Cripplegate and provide an annual revenue which \\"shall be employed to ffurnish Bedds, Linnen and Cloths and other necessities of the said poor ffrench Protestants who shall be in the said place\\".Will of Jacques de Gastigny, National Archives, Kew (prob 11/505). This set in train the establishment of the French Hospital that was to be a forerunner of health and welfare institutions set up in England in the eighteenth century. Burial monument to the dead of the French Hospital at the City of London Cemetery Philippe M√©nard, executor of Jacques de Gastigny's estate, served as secretary for an appeal to supplement the bequest. The appeal was so successful that the idea grew not merely to build an extension to the Cripplegate pest-house but to build a new hospital building. The French Hospital was incorporated under the Great Seal by letters patent dated 24 July 1718. The corporation chose as its own seal an image of Elijah being fed by the ravens (1 Kings 17:6), with the motto Dominus providebit (\\"The Lord will provide\\"). An inventory of the contents of the hospital from 1742 survives.Transcript published in Murdoch and Vigne, pp. 111‚Äì16. By the early nineteenth century, the number of inmates of the hospital had fallen and the buildings in Finsbury were in urgent need of restoration. Rather than rebuilding the hospital on its Bath Street site, it was decided to find a new London location. Victoria Park, Hackney When the new hospital in Hackney opened in 1865 the Builder claimed it had been modelled on the Ch√¢teau de Chambord.Builder, 2 June 1866. The architect, Robert Lewis Roumieu, who had generously waived his fee for his drawings, was for a while the hospital's treasurer. Besides being a hospital for its sixty inmates, with state-of-the-art equipment, it also consolidated a revival of interest in Huguenot history and achievement and became a repository for Huguenot records and items with a Huguenot tradition. In 1941 the inmates were evacuated and the French Hospital building was requisitioned as a day nursery for mothers doing war work, although the Court Room and Library were retained. With the growth and consolidation of state health and welfare after the war, the directors decided that the hospital's future lay as an almshouse in a new location. Roumieu's building was sold and became St Victoire School for Girls. Since 2014 the building has been home to the Mossbourne Victoria Park Academy.Mossbourne Victoria Park Academy website. Compton's Lea, Horsham A fine Victorian house standing in its own ten acres was bought in 1947. But occupancy was too low and the hospital was running at a loss, although the situation was redeemed by revenue from other property owned by the hospital. The idea of \\"conversion into almshouses of a square of small houses off Rochester High Street\\" tentatively suggested a few years earlier now found favour at the directors' court of April 1956 and the project \\"to use Theobald Square as homes for old people\\" was to proceed.Murdoch and Vigne, p. 75. French Hospital today La Providence, Rochester In September 1959 the first nineteen flats on Theobald Square now officially renamed La Providence in the cathedral city of Rochester were filled. The doctor's house at 105 High Street was renumbered 41 La Providence. Today the French Hospital's main duty is still to provide care \\"for those among us who are in distress\\".This has been said in French at every meeting of the court of the French Hospital since September 1718: \\"B√©nis cette maison, que ta Providence a pr√©par√©e pour nos afflig√©s\\" [Bless this house that thy good Providence hath prepared for those among us who are in distress]. See Murdoch and Vigne, p. 86. Over the years many distinguished Huguenot settlers or their descendants have been associated with the hospital, from the soldiers Henri de Massue de Ruvigny, Earl of Galway and John Ligonier, 1st Earl Ligonier (both of whom served as governors of the hospital), to the diplomatist John Robethon and the surgeon Paul Buissi√®re (both also governors), to the lawyer Sir Samuel Romilly and the archaeologist Sir Austen Henry Layard.Layard's \\"original forenames, Henry Austen, were reversed at the request of his uncle [a solicitor], whose partner and heir Layard hoped to become\\".

She was elected to the Indianapolis Board of School Commissioners in 1966 during the desegregation and integration period. Under her administration as president in 1970, Indianapolis developed their desegregation plan. She was honored as Woman of the Year in 1970 by Theta Sigma Phi for her service in implementing integration and for being the only woman to have served on the board. She also served on the Tax Review Board and Historic Landmarks Foundation. She had a lifelong commitment to education and has had numerous awards named in her honor. Biography Anna Margaret Ross was born on November 17, 1913, in Lafayette, Tippecanoe County, Indiana to Linn Carnahan Ross and Gladys Gould Ross. She attended Jefferson High School in Lafayette before earning her Bachelor of Science at Purdue University in 1935. That same year on 14 August 1935, she married John Arthur Alexander. The two met at Purdue and her husband became an attorney with Krieg, DeVault, Alexander, and Capehart in Indianapolis. The couple made their home in Indianapolis and had two sons. Alexander organized the first mental health fund drive in Marion County, Indiana and spent six years on the Marion County Mental Health Board. She was concerned about reading levels and became involved in the school system, joining the Parent Teacher‚Äôs Associations of PS #80 and Broad Ripple High School. She was elected to the Indianapolis Board of School Commissioners in 1966 and served until 1970. Her final year, she was president. This was the period when Indianapolis‚Äôs public schools were desegregated, the teaching staff was integrated, and public busing began. Multiple lawsuits were filed and the school commissioners implemented the federal desegregation programs. The final plan which was adopted, involved phasing out the two mostly black high schools and redirecting the elementary graduates to other high schools. Crispus Attucks High School would close after 3 years and Shortridge High School would be turned into a Community College. Alexander confirmed that the plan, while addressing the lawsuit mandate, had been developed independently from the federal recommendations by the board over several months with consultations from citizens and the schools. Also during Alexander's tenure, hot lunches were implemented in all elementary schools in the school district and instructional TV was begun. She was honored at a banquet attended by the governor as the Theta Sigma Phi Woman of the Year in 1970 for her service as the only woman on the Indianapolis School Board. Alexander served on the Marion County Tax Review Board for three years in the early 1970s and served for nineteen years on the state's Historic Landmarks Foundation. Other organizations that Alexander was involved with included The Children‚Äôs Museum of Indianapolis, Indiana Landmarks, Indiana State Symphony Society, Indianapolis Museum of Art, Mother‚Äôs March of Dimes for Polio, and St. Paul‚Äôs Episcopal Church.Anna Margaret Ross Alexander Papers, 1955‚Äì1994, Ruth Lilly Special Collections and Archives, University Library, Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis. Alexander also was a long-term volunteer and donor at the Mary Rigg Neighborhood Center, which gives out annual honors to volunteers, ‚ÄúHelp & Hope Hero Awards,‚Äù named in her honor. Alexander died 16 February 1995. Purdue‚Äôs baseball facility was named in honor of Alexander and her husband when the new stadium was dedicated in 2013.

She established a local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Marion, Indiana, in 1918 and became especially active fighting for justice and equality following the double lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith in 1930. As president of the Indiana NAACP, Bailey was pivotal in lobbying for passage of a statewide anti-lynching law in Indiana in 1931 and advocated for a similar bill at the national level. She was also a recipient of the national NAACP's Madam C. J. Walker Medal. Early life and education Katherine Harvey, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Charles Harvey, was born in Kokomo, Indiana, in 1895. Known as \\"Flossie\\", she grew up in Kokomo and attended Kokomo High School. James H. Madison, \\"Katherine 'Flossie' Bailey\\" in Marriage and family Flossie married Walter T. Bailey, a physician, in 1917. The couple resided in Marion, Indiana. Doctor Bailey died on February 10, 1950. Their only surviving child was a son, named Walter Charles Bailey. While living in Marion, Bailey also became actively involved in the Marion community. She was a member of the city's Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church congregation. Career Bailey spent her adult life seeking equality and justice as a civil rights activist. In 1918 Bailey established the Marion branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Initially it did not receive much support. In June 1930 it had 96 members; however, after the Marion community was the site of a lynching in August 1930, the local chapter's membership increase to 155 members by the end of 1930.Madison, \\"Katherine 'Flossie' Bailey\\" in Indiana's 200, p. 11. On August 7, 1930, a mob broke into the Grant County, Indiana, jail in Marion, dragged two African-American men, Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith, to the Courthouse Square and lynched (hanged) them from a tree. Bailey, who was the president of the local branch of the NAACP, tried to obtain police protection for the jailed men prior to the lynching. Afterwards, she was actively involved in organizing a Hoosier delegation of NAACP members to speak to Indiana governor Harry Leslie and persuade him to intervene in the investigation of the men's murders. Bailey and a number of others worked hard to obtain a fair investigation into the double lynching. Despite objections from those in the Marion community who wanted to forget about the event, Bailey and the NAACP played an important role in seeking justice for the murders of Shipp and Smith, as well as to restore calm in Marion. Two men were indicted and went on trial for the lynching, but neither one was found guilty of the crime and no one was ever punished for the deaths of Shipp and Smith.Madison, \\"Flossie Bailey,\\" Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, pp. 23‚Äì25. In 1930, Bailey was elected president of the Indiana NAACP and helped plan its second annual meeting. The Bailey home in Marion became the Indiana headquarters for the NAACP. The national organization recognized Bailey's efforts by awarding her the Madam C. J. Walker Medal for \\"the person who has done the best work in the NAACP during the year.\\"Madison, \\"Flossie Bailey\\", Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, p. 25. Bailey worked to ensure nothing like the lynching in Marion would occur again. She lobbied the Indiana General Assembly to pass stricter anti-lynching laws. When opponents to the bill rejected many of the safety measures, Bailey organized a statewide effort, calling on chapters of the NAACP, Optimist Clubs, Exchange Clubs, and Democratic organizations to lobby state legislators. Bailey's efforts were successful and the governor signed a stricter anti-lynching law in March 1931. Once the Indiana bill became law, Bailey began lobbying for a national anti- lynching law, as well as for the fair treatment of African Americans in other sectors of American life.

She was a member of the Woman‚Äôs Franchise League of Indiana and the treasurer of the Indiana Equal Suffrage Association. Biography Marion Harvie was born September 8, 1872UK General Register Office, PO Box 2, Southport, Merseyside, PR8 2JD, United Kingdom Cheshire, England to Thomas and Elizabeth (Watt) Harvie. She immigrated to the United States in the 1890s, with her sister Alice. She taught at a private girls‚Äô school in New England before attending Brown University from 1898 to 1902. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in philosophy. On 20 June 1901 in Rhode Island, Harvie married Harry Everett Barnard and the couple moved to New Hampshire, where Harry worked as a chemist for the State Board of Health. In 1905, the couple moved to Indianapolis, Indiana. Barnard became involved in reviving the defunct Indiana suffragist movement. At a meeting held in May, 1906, in Kokomo, she was elected to serve as treasurer of the Indiana Auxiliary of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. At a suffrage convention held between 16 and 17 March 1909 in Logansport, Barnard was re-elected treasurer. Barnard was still serving as treasurer of the Indiana Auxiliary in 1914 and archival records at the Indiana Historical Society show she had correspondence with Carrie Chapman Catt. In 1909, the Woman‚Äôs Franchise League of Indiana was formed to try to get a woman elected on the school board. Barnard was a member of the organization, and a member of the Irvington Women‚Äôs Club. The Women's Club was involved in sanitation efforts such as cleaning up markets and groceries, safe drinking water, and waste disposal. Her husband who was the director of the Indiana State Food and Drug Commission, supported these efforts closing down bakeries and unsanitary businesses that handled food. Barnard also started the Indianapolis Social Register and was one of the founding members of the Irvington Dancing Club. She and her husband had two children. Barnard died 5 March 1969 in Indianapolis and was buried at Washington Park East Cemetery in Indianapolis.

Sullivan that he believed served to minimize the tension of anxiety. The self-system was defined as a unique collection of experiences that was used to describe one's own self. For the most part, Sullivan claimed that the self-system was the result of appraisals provided by caregivers during early childhood.Ewen, Robert B. (2010).‚ÄúHarry Stack Sullivan: The Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry.‚Äù In An Introduction to Theories of Personality. Psychology Press. 7th Edition. pp. 141-145. Sullivan considered the self-system as a major structure in personality development that could appear as early as 6 months of age. The positive reinforcement a child received during mid-infancy would not only prompt the development of the self- system, but also act as preparation for societal expectations.  Sullivan's self-system  In order for the self-system to develop, Sullivan affirmed that \\"good me\\" and \\"bad me\\" personifications must first form. These personifications are organized perceptions that are account of certain experiences. The \\"good me\\" personification consists of experiences that are rewarded, which a child would sense a noticeable decrease of anxiety. The \\"bad me\\" personification on the other hand consists of experiences that are punished and cause greater anxiety to a child. These personifications then fuse into what Sullivan called the self-system. Furthermore, Sullivan emphasized that the self-system was the product of two additional factors: # The exploration of an infant's own body: Sullivan provided thumb sucking as an example of the exploration a child has during mid-infancy. The very act of thumb sucking would help differentiate the infant from himself or herself and others. # The appraisals from caregivers: Sullivan believed that interpersonal relationships were vital in personality development and specifically in the formation of the self-system. Therefore, the type of appraisals a child receives will determine the kind of self-dynamism they will develop.  Comparison to Freudian constructs  The self-system revolves around the idea of perception, evaluation, and regulatory behavior. Since this concept is associated with the self, it was often compared to Sigmund Freud's ego construct. Freudian analysts were concerned about the self-system, claiming that it was equivalent to the ego. This is because like both the self-system and the ego develop during early childhood and also serve to reduce anxiety (although the ego works with the id to reduce this anxiety). Additionally, they both include some sort of protective activity, mainly to decrease anxiety. Freud developed defense mechanisms, whereas Sullivan created security operations. In one of five lectures Sullivan gave at the White Psychiatric Foundation in 1947, he acknowledged that the self-system does have a few similarities with the psychoanalytic ego, however they are two different theoretical systems.(p. 167)  Security operations  To reduce anxiety, Sullivan emphasized that the self-system must use two specific security operations, dissociation and selective inattention.Feist, J and Feist, G.J (2009). \\"Sullivan :Interpersonal theory\\" in Theories of Personality . New York, NY: McGraw-Hill Dissociation: This security operation describes the failure to acknowledge an undesirable portion of one's personality. An event may have been so threatening, that a child feels the need to disown that particular material. Dissociation is considered unconscious and must remain that way in order to prevent abnormal behavior from occurring. For example: A child might claim and believe that their hand was responsible for an action in order to prevent punishment. Selective Inattention: Similar to dissociation, selective inattention is accomplished unconsciously. The self-system reduces anxiety by merely ignoring any signs of threatening events and proceeds with regular activity. A child will act like nothing happened. For example: A mother yells at her child for throwing sand outside the sandbox. The child continues to play in the sandbox without showing any indications that he has been screamed at.  Disadvantages  According to Sullivan, although the self-system serves to diminish anxiety, it is resistant to change. The self- system might get the impression that they can handle any situation, even though it rejects a situation or merely disowns it. The more the self-system encounters anxiety provoking events, the more ambitious the self-system will get. Additionally, the self-system may make a person believe that she is unique in many more ways than she really is. Sullivan also referred to the self-system as a \\"microscope.\\" When looking through a microscope for the first time, the image is blurry, therefore we must adjust the knobs to focus on the specific specimen we want to view. The self-system is the same way; it must focus much of its attention on experiences with close others, whether they resulted in reward or punishment, in order to form a clear image of ourselves. For the reason that the self-system focuses solely on experiences that resulted in pain or pleasure, it ignores what is going on outside of these experiences. Because the self-system is derived from the appraisals a child has experienced, negative events can affect its development. Sullivan explained in his first lecture, ‚ÄúBasic Conceptions,‚Äù that if a child only encountered belittling events as an infant, he or she will develop a self- system that will conform with these standards. This means that a child will think low of him or her self and find fault in everything he or she does. Not only will this critical self-system affect the way a child views him or herself, but also the way they view other people.

The poem was first published in 1789 as part of Blake's collection of poems entitled Songs of Innocence. A 1795 hand painted version of \\"A Dream\\" from Copy L of Songs of Innocence and of Experience currently held by the Yale Center for British Art Background Songs of Innocence is a collection of 19 illustrated poems published in 1789. According to scholar Donald A. Dike, the collection does not ‚Äúdescribe an absolute state of being or fashion an autonomous truth.‚Äù Rather, he says the poems are resistant, being ‚Äúconsciously against something and trying to see their way through something.‚Äù Songs of Innocence was followed by Blake's Songs of Experience in 1794. The two collections were published together under the title Songs of Innocence and of Experience, showing the \\"two contrary states of the human soul.‚Äù The poem An 1826 version of \\"A Dream\\" from Copy AA of Songs of Innocence and of Experience currently held at The Fitzwilliam Museum. Structure and summary In this poem, Blake portrays the concepts of the return to innocence from experience. No wonder the artist thought first of including it in ‚ÄúSongs of Experience‚Äù at first, finally deciding to move it back to ‚ÄúSongs of Innocence‚Äù (according to the Blake Digital Text Project). The theme of the child who is lost and later found is also present in the character of the Emmet (ant) who is given the privilege of capitalisation to show its personification; also in the ant's children, and even maybe in the narrator's person. There is a strong presence of the natural world, very much admired by Blake, and his means toward mysticism, notably in contrast with Wordsworth's ‚Äú‚Äôatheistic‚Äô love of nature‚Äù (Kazin 35). Also, the concept of guidance and protection appears through the text in different forms, as a means to return to a lost innocence. Themes and critical analysis Isabelle Keller-Privat describes ‚ÄúA Dream‚Äù as a piece that, like other Songs of Innocence poems, ‚Äúemphasizes the interconnections between the actors, the voices and the rhythms that give the poem its coherence and harmony.‚Äù This coherence and harmony give the poem its sense of innocence. The world of this poem is portrayed as friendly and the characters are helpful. Yet a hint of experience can also be felt in ‚ÄúA Dream‚Äù through the emmet's fear of its surroundings and its tired, damaged appearance. The emmet has experienced hardship and separation beyond the innocence of the dream. Dike writes that, by putting the dream's concerns into the world of an insect, Blake extends the ‚Äúusual limits of sympathy.‚Äù Resolution is found for the emmet through cooperation with the other characters of the dream.

Maternity plot Harriet Kramer Linkin explores the inverted maternity plot present in \\"A Dream.\\" In many of the poems in Songs of Innocence, Blake portrays mothers as nurturing and protective. However, as Linkin writes, in \\"A Dream\\" the \\"inversion of a popular narrative of idealized maternity pointedly suggests that the domestic ideology is nothing more than a fantasy of Generation.\\" Rather than a father returning to his waiting wife and children, the mother is the one returning to her husband and children at home. This maternity plot in \\"A Dream\\" follows a trend of absent mothers in other Songs of Innocence poems. According to Linkin, Blake \\"attends to the problematic institution of a domestic ideology that restructures the middle-class family.\\" References External links *A Comparison of Extant copies of Blake's original hand- illustrated prints of the poem at the William Blake Archive Category:Songs of Innocence and of Experience Category:Dreams in fiction Category:1789 poems ","title":"A Dream (Blake poem)"},{"id":"46214635","text":"Wilaiwan Kunlapha (born 25 December 1987) is a Thai road cyclist, who currently rides for UCI Women's Continental Team .

He is known for his collaborations with Cornelis van Dalem. Work General Only a few works by Jan van Wechelen are known to exist as most of his oeuvre was destroyed by war and the Iconoclasm of the 16th century.Hans van Wechelen at De Jonchkeere Master Paintings The majority of these are landscapes and religious scenes. His oeuvre also includes a few genres scenes and an architectural painting of a church interior.Church interior with Christ preaching to a crowd, at the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam The artist‚Äôs work enjoyed an excellent reputation at the beginning of the 17th century and was collected by Rubens as well as the prominent art collectors Cornelis van der Geest and Pieter Stevens. The Legend of the Baker of Eeklo Jan van Wechelen collaborated regularly with fellow Antwerp artist Cornelis van Dalem. Van Wechelen was a gifted staffage painter and his dignified figures are regarded as well suited to van Dalem‚Äôs landscapes. At least three such collaborations between the two artists are suspected. This includes a Landscape with nomads (also known as Landscape with gypsies at the Staatliche Kunsthalle Karlsruhe.Sally Metzler, 'Bartholomeus Spranger: Splendor and Eroticism in Imperial Prague', Metropolitan Museum of Art, 3 November 2014, p. 19-20 This painting likely represents a family of gypsies as a seated woman wears the distinctive oval white hat which was a common indicator for a gypsy woman in 16th century Flemish paintings.Larry Silver, Morbid Fascination: Death by Bruegel, in: Walter Melion, Bret Rothstein, Michel Weemans (editors), 'The Anthropomorphic Lens: Anthropomorphism, Microcosmism and Analogy in Early Modern Thought and Visual Arts', Brill, 7 November 2014, p. 432 The baker of Eeklo An interesting genre painting made in collaboration with Cornelis van Dalem is the composition The Legend of the Baker of Eeklo. The original of the painting is lost but a presumed copy of the original is part of the collection of the Rijksmuseum and is on loan to the Muiderslot. There also exist many versions said to have been made by the circle of, or after Cornelis van Dalem and Jan van Wechelen. The composition was engraved by Frederik Bouttats the Younger. The painting depicts a legend told about the citizens of Eeklo in Flanders. When they were unhappy with the look of their heads, they would go to the village bakery. There the baker and his assistants would lop off their heads and place cabbages on their necks to stem the bleeding. The improved heads would then be kneaded and rolled, rubbed with a new finish, baked in the oven and ultimately replaced. The composition recounts the whole process. However, there was always the risk that a new head would fail to bake, or over-bake, thus resulting in a deformed or deficient head. There is a scene of a woman holding a severed head who is having a discussion with the baker dressed in red. She is probably trying to return the head of her husband with which she is not happy. This story had a moral and cautionary message to those who were dissatisfied with their appearance and wanted to do something drastic about it.Circle of Cornelis van Dalem (Antwerp c. 1530-1573 Breda) and Jan van Wechelen (active Antwerp c. 1530-1550), The Legend of the Baker of Eeklo at Christie‚ÄôsAfter Cornelis van Dalem (Antwerp c. 1530-1573 Breda) and Jan van Wechelen (active Antwerp c. 1530-1550), The Legend of the Baker of Eeklo at Bonhams Church interior with Christ preaching to a crowd Church interior with Christ preaching to a crowd A composition entitled Church interior with Christ preaching to a crowd (Rijksmuseum) is attributed to a collaboration between van Wechelen and van Dalem. It shows a large church interior with a crowd of people in contemporary as well as foreign dress who are listening to Jesus Christ who is preaching while seated near a column. The interior of the church is quite barren and the only decorations seen are some sculptures high on the columns. Various scenes are depicted in the interior of the church such as priests chasing away children, a man with a walking stick and a dog who is accosted by a man in thorn clothes (a beggar?), some dogs sniffing each other, a couple flirting, a man with a shovel etc. Van Dalem, his collaborator on this composition, was suspected of being a Protestant and possibly the composition contains criticism of the Catholic Church. By placing a preaching Jesus amidst modern church architecture and a contemporary crowd the composition should possibly also be read against the background of the iconoclasm of the Beeldenstorm, which had caused a reflection on the role of religious art in the Low Countries. The attack on sculptures and paintings had placed the entire church interior under discussion. Finding answers to questions such as what a church should be, which type of architecture was suitable and how it should be embellished had become urgent. Contemporary religious practice was compared with the words and deeds of Christ and his apostles and the past and the future of religion, its temples and its rites were under scrutiny.Koenraad Jonckheere, Antwerp Art after Iconoclasm: Experiments in Decorum, 1566-1585, Mercatorfonds, February 19, 2013, p. 260-261 Kermesse Jan van Wechelen produced three versions of a composition representing a village kermesse with peasants making merry. The prime version painted on panel is now in a private European collection, while two other versions were sold at Sotheby‚Äôs respectively on 1 April 1992 (lot 57, on panel) and 5 December 2007 (lot 19, on canvas). There are some differences between the various versions.Nadine Orenstein, Pieter Bruegel the Elder: Drawings and Prints, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1 Jan 2001, p. 206 Jan van Wechelen succeeded in these genre scenes to bring the kermesses to life. He was close to Pieter Brueghel the Elder in his ability to animate these picturesque scenes with a great number of characters with comical and delightful attitudes. The realism in his genre paintings reveal a rather profane spirit while his lines with clearly emphasized forms connect his work to the rigorist trends that were developing in the Low Countries around 1540. Religious paintings Ecce Homo Jan van Wechelen painted a number of religious compositions. His Ecce Homo (Indianapolis Museum of Art) reprises a theme and setting that had become popular in Flemish art from the 15th century. Placing this subject matter of Jesus being shown to the people in a contemporary setting was not uncommon as is demonstrated by a work of Gillis Mostaert, which places the scene on the main square of Antwerp.Buyck Jean F., Gillis Mostaert - Christus door Pilatus aan het volk getoond at tento By staging the dramatic scene on the square of a Flemish town an accusation of sinfulness and culpability is directed at the contemporary crowd witnessing the event. That children also share culpability is implied by the prominent presence of children among the spectators. The cartload of crosses in the foreground on the right refers to the people's call for Christ's execution.Jan van Wechelen, Ecce Homo at the (Indianapolis Museum of Art) Jan van Wechelen painted at least two versions of the Road to Calvary, another theme popularized by Pieter Brueghel the Elder. One of the paintings is in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya and the other one in a private collection (previously Oppenheimer collection).Binding advice on dispute over the painting Road to Calvary Van Wechelen again opted to place this passion scene against the backdrop of a contemporary town. In the foreground we can see people coming out of their houses and leaving their vegetable stalls to get closer and get a better view of the 'show'.

The commutator collecting process was introduced by Philip Hall in 1934 and articulated by Wilhelm Magnus in 1937. W. Magnus (1937), \\"√úber Beziehungen zwischen h√∂heren Kommutatoren\\", J. Grelle 177, 105-115. The process is sometimes called a \\"collection process\\". The process can be generalized to define a totally ordered subset of a free non- associative algebra, that is, a free magma; this subset is called the Hall set. Members of the Hall set are binary trees; these can be placed in one-to- one correspondence with words, these being called the Hall words; the Lyndon words are a special case. Hall sets are used to construct a basis for a free Lie algebra, entirely analogously to the commutator collecting process. Hall words also provide a unique factorization of monoids. Statement The commutator collecting process is usually stated for free groups, as a similar theorem then holds for any group by writing it as a quotient of a free group. Suppose F1 is a free group on generators a1, ..., am. Define the descending central series by putting :Fn+1 = [Fn, F1] The basic commutators are elements of F1 defined and ordered as follows. *The basic commutators of weight 1 are the generators a1, ..., am. *The basic commutators of weight w > 1 are the elements [x, y] where x and y are basic commutators whose weights sum to w, such that x > y and if x = [u, v] for basic commutators u and v then v ‚â§ y. Commutators are ordered so that x > y if x has weight greater than that of y, and for commutators of any fixed weight some total ordering is chosen. Then Fn/Fn+1 is a finitely generated free abelian group with a basis consisting of basic commutators of weight n. Then any element of F can be written as :g=c_1^{n_1}c_2^{n_2}\\\\cdots c_k^{n_k}c where the ci are the basic commutators of weight at most m arranged in order, and c is a product of commutators of weight greater than m, and the ni are integers.

She was educated at Guilford High School, where she graduated in 1992, and went on to attend the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and San Francisco State University, where she earned a B.S. and an M.A. in kinesiology in 1996 and 2002 respectively. Miller competed in track athletics in high school and soccer in both high school and college. After graduating from college she played semi-professional soccer for a team in Madison for one season before the team disbanded, following which she was introduced to cycling by her then boyfriend. She represented her nation at the 2009 UCI Road World Championships and in cyclo cross at the 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013 UCI Cyclo-cross World Championships.  Professional cycling career  In 2002, she signed her first professional contract with the Talgo America Cycling Team, joining Dede Demet-Barry, Sue Palmer-Komar, and Anne Samplonius. Miller slotted into the role of domestique. Moving to Denmark in the fall of 2002, she joined the Danish S.A.T.S. professional cycling team for the 2003 season. She did four ten-day stage races as well as another 35 race days that season. She followed a similar program in 2004 and 2005 as well. She raced most of the World Cup in those years, including: Tour of Flanders, Fleche Wallone, Tour L'Aude, Giro d'Italia Femminile, Grande Boucle Feminine Internationale, as well as a swing to North America for races like the Coupe de Monde Cyclist Feminine de Montreal. While she moved to New Zealand in 2005, she continued racing for Team S.A.T.S., living in France for much of the season. S.A.T.S. folded at the end of the season. In 2006, while still living in New Zealand, her job brought her to the United States, racing for Team Lipton. The squad was growing from being a regional presence to a national program, with heavy hitters like Miller, Laura Van Guilder, and Kristin Armstrong. The team had plans to support their riders through the 2008 Olympics. Riding for the team in 2007, Miller won both the second stage and the overall at the San Dimas Stage Race. The team folded at the end of 2007, and Miller joined Aaron's Pro Women's Cycling team in 2008. The year with Aaron's was momentous. As the season was closing in, she decided to try cyclocross. Team director Carmen D'Alusio, a 'crosser herself, suggested doing a full cyclocross program, and helped arrange a spot for her on the California Giant Strawberries team, as both Aaron's and Cal Giant had Specialized as a sponsor. She debuted at the second annual CrossVegas race, finishing in ninth place. The racing was fun, the season a success, and the relationship remained for the next six seasons. In 2009, Miller joined Team TIBCO. She joined up with 2008 national road champ Brooke Miller, as well as Katharine Carroll, Jerika Hutchinson, Amber Rais, Alison Starnes, and Lauren Tamayo. While signed as a domestique to support Miller, she rode to her biggest victory on the road, winning the national road race championship. That resulted in a ride at the World Road Championships in Mendrisio, Switzerland, where she rode in support of Kristin Armstrong (4th), giving up her wheels when Armstrong flatted. In 'cross, she grew as a racer, finishing second at the nationals in 2009, earning a ride at the 2010 Cyclocross World Championships. The trip starting a five-year streak of representing the United States at cyclocross worlds. 2010, she continued to split her time between TIBCO on the road and Cal Giant in cyclocross. At TIBCO, she became the road captain, calling the shots for the team from inside the peloton. In cyclocross, she finished third at nationals. As the road season drew to a close in 2013, she decided to call it quits on her road career, and dedicate herself to cyclocross. She told VeloNews, \\"This year, I'm still having fun, but I'm definitely getting tired and not wanting to be away from home so much anymore, and just felt it was the right time, I still don't know what I'm going to do next.\\" Next turned out to be starting a cyclocross team. For the 2014 season, she started the Noosa Professional Cyclocross Team. Her role was rider, co-manager, and co-owner. She secured and managed the sponsors, worked on public relations, managed the team budget and logistics and staff, and still managed to train and race. The biggest win in her 'cross career came at CrossVegas, debuting her new team at the event, in front of the entire bike industry and a star-packed field. While racing for Noosa in cyclocross, she raced intermittently for Pepper Palace on the road to keep fitness ahead of the cyclocross season.  Retirement  She retired from cyclocross at the conclusion of the 2015-16 cyclocross season. Even in retirement, she's been busy. She won Grinduro in 2016, followed up by a fifth place in a \\"local\\" cyclocross race, the U.S. Open of Cyclocross in Boulder. After Grinduro, she told Cyclocross Magazine, \\"When I retired from racing, I still loved my bike. I still loved racing, in fact. I was tired of intervals. I was tired of having to ride my bike. Without the stress of structured training, I've enjoyed riding my bike even more.\\" In January, 2018 she won the U.S. Women's National Singlespeed Cyclocross Championship in Reno, Nevada. She currently works for Rapha in her hometown of Boulder, Colorado.

The station served the Parkdale village on the then-outskirts of Toronto. The station served trains on the Northern Railway of Canada and Credit Valley Railway, later the Canadian Pacific Railway, railways. It was situated at the intersection of Dufferin Street and Queen Street West. The train station was decommissioned in the 1970s. History The first station was built in 1856 by the Ontario Simcoe and Huron Union Railroad Company, which later became the Northern Railway of Canada in 1858. It was a small wooden building situated to the east of the lines, south of Gladstone Avenue and the Gladstone Hotel at Queen Street. In 1885, it was expanded and re-oriented to face the rail lines. The track traversed Dufferin and Queen Streets at an angle, just east of the intersection, at a level crossing from the north-west to the south-east. In the 1870s, the Grand Trunk Railway built a railway station at Jameson Avenue, on its east-west line. It was named South Parkdale, and the Queen Street station was given the name of North Parkdale station. Original CVR station in 1898 A second set of rails parallel and to the west of the earlier lines was installed with the coming of the Credit Valley Railway (CVR). In 1879, a new station building was opened on the west side of the tracks, to the south of Queen Street and east of Dufferin Street. The two stations became a \\"union station\\" between the two rail lines. A small rail yard was also constructed south of the location, alongside the rail lines south to King Street, and including a roundhouse, a car shop, a paint shop and a blacksmith shop. In the 1880s, the line was subsumed by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). In 1888, the Northern Railway station became part of the Grand Trunk, which had taken over the Northern Railway. There were now three sets of rails crossing Queen Street and Dufferin at a level crossing. A plan was soon developed to build a \\"subway\\" under the tracks. In the 1890s, an east-west tunnel was built for Queen Street, crossing under the rail lines. Dufferin Street north of Queen Street was closed. This gap in Dufferin Street became known as the \\"Dufferin jog\\" as vehicles travelling north-south on Dufferin had to go one block east to Gladstone Avenue via Queen and Peel Streets. In 2010, a north-south tunnel was built to connect the sections of Dufferin Street. Queen Street looking west in 1899 In the 1910s, the South Parkdale station was closed and replaced with Sunnyside railway station. At the time, a cut was made and the rail lines of the Grand Trunk were moved below street level. The North Parkdale stations were given new signage of \\"Parkdale\\", returning to the original name. In 1958, the station was used by Princess Margaret during a royal tour for a royal train from Parkdale to Stratford, Ontario. On July 31, 1958, Margaret visited Toronto to visit City Hall and dedicate the new Princess Margaret fountain at Exhibition Place, before going to Parkdale Station. During the later 19th century and the early 20th century, streetcar lines were extended west of Dufferin Street on King and Queen streets, connecting the area with the central business district. During the 20th century, the Parkdale stations saw a decline in passenger traffic. By the 1970s, the stations were little used for passenger traffic and were closed. Canadian Pacific demolished their train station. The Grand Trunk station, by now part of the Canadian National Railways system, was closed and moved to a location at Queen and Roncesvalles in 1977. It was destroyed by fire later that year. Today There are no buildings left on the site. On the original station site, Sudbury Street has been extended north to Queen Street, cutting through the original lands. On the west side, the CPR yard was closed and developed with condominium buildings. The rail lines are still in use, carrying GO Transit and Via Rail passenger traffic and freight traffic. A former staircase up to the station platforms from Queen Street was bricked in, and the arch is still visible.

Over a career that spans more than half a century, Amaral has also been dedicated to painting, etchings, collages, furniture design, assemblages/objects, and artist‚Äôs books. The artist has been widely recognized for his draughtsmanship, the subtlety and refinement of his technique as well as his imaginative and cultured universe. As a constant experimenter, Amaral has developed a unique aesthetics and symbolism and therefore has never belonged to any style or movement in particular. However, his work has been linked, for example, to surrealism and ancient Greece (sculpture). His art is deeply rooted in the psychological realms of the human existence. Amaral has always been focused on the condition of the human being, especially the topic of death and the passing time. \\"I am only trying to understand the world, to live through my painting. I am trying to understand certain mysteries, such as the energies of life and death, the loneliness of a man (...) I paint what people can reflect upon, so that what stays with the spectator is not only the visual impact\\". left For the years 2013-2014 he was chosen as the author of the graphic imagery for the VIII Cartagena International Music Festival in Cartagena, Colombia, organised by The Salvi Foundation. His large scale bronze sculptures are located outdoors in different sites in Bogot√°, Colombia, such as in the garden of The National Museum and, since 1996, at the entrance to the Bolsa de Valores de Colombia BVC on Carrera S√©ptima (3 bronze sculptures Women with wheels,1994). In 2013 the artist published a calendar called Aguas Turbias with a collection of 14 drawings from a series with the same title.Jim Amaral \\"Doored chest\\", 2000, bronze. The Sculpture Garden in The National Museum, Bogot√°, Colombia (permanent collection). Biography and education Amaral was born in 1933 in Pleasanton, California, USA. His father was Portuguese and his mother was American of Italian descent. Amaral grew up in a rural environment in Pleasanton and remembers that period as \\"living in an interior exile\\". As a teenager he wrote poetry, which has always been his great source of inspiration. And years later it turned out to be vice versa - because of the lyrical aspect of Amaral's sculptures, drawings, oil paintings and graphic works, these have become illustrations for poems by such poets as Edoardo Sanguineti or Armando Rojas Guardia.Jim Amaral \\"Shield N¬∫ 6\\", 1993, bronze. The Sculpture Garden in The National Museum, Bogot√°, Colombia (permanent collection).After two years at the University of Washington, Seattle (1952‚Äì53) where he studied, among other subjects, history of art and architecture, Amaral finally decided for a career in the arts at the Stanford University in California and in 1954 graduated with a title Bachelor of Arts. \\"When I abandoned United States I realized that art is my only option, the only place where I am not a foreigner\\". He continued postgraduate studies at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan (1954-1955), where he met Colombian visual artist and future wife Olga de Amaral (got married in Colombia in December 1957). Before moving to Bogot√° in 1958, Amaral spend two years (1955‚Äì57) in the Philippine Islands with the U.S.Navy (obligatory military service). In Bogot√°, Amaral started working with a furniture and interior design company. Soon his son was born and Amaral decided to become a full-time artist and began casting bronze sculptures, making collages and abstract drawings. In 1960 his daughter was born. From 1966 to 1967 the Amaral family moved temporarily to New York. In 1967, after coming back to Colombia, Amaral traveled to the US again to teach drawing at the Penland School of the Arts and Crafts in North Carolina. In the same year he also started teaching drawing at the Universidad Jorge Tadeo Lozano in Bogot√°. In the years 1970-1972 the Amaral family traveled around Europe, settling down for a longer period in Paris, where in the fall of 1971, at the Albert Loeb gallery, Amaral showed his work for the first time in Europe. The exhibition brought him great critical acclaim. He traveled to Paris again for longer periods in the years 1974-1975 and 1979-1980. In 1989 Amaral taught drawing at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), USA. Currently he lives with his wife in Bogot√° and works in Casa Amaral.Untitled, 1971; 39 √ó 29 cm; pencil and watercolour on paper. Floreille d'Olga pour elle, p.a., 1978; 34 √ó 25 cm; engraving.

Works  Early career in the 1960s and 1970s  In his first solo show in 1962 at the Vorpal Gallery in San Francisco, Amaral exhibited small ink drawings humorously depicting erotic themes. This exhibition was important in the cultural context of the values change in the US, the transition from the beatniks to the hippies, which favoured a new attitude towards sex. The 1960s were also a period of great unrest and Amaral himself suffered an episode of depression in that time. A psychoanalytic treatment resulted in a series of \\"psychological\\" drawings that the artist considers as skill exercises and a result of the atmosphere of the time. In 1964, Amaral had his first solo show in Colombia, in Galer√≠a El Callej√≥n, where he exhibited drawings, collages and oil paintings. Toward the end of the sixties, Amaral worked increasingly with erotic themes and in 1970 participated in a group exhibition entitled El erotismo en el arte at the Galer√≠a Belarca in Bogot√°. In 1972 at the same gallery, he showed drawings in a new technique that he started to develop earlier in Paris - a mix of pencil and watercolour on paper treated previously with gesso. Jim Amaral \\"Invisible Flowers, Plate 05\\", 1979, watercolour on paper. During the 1970s Amaral exhibited in France, Italy, Sweden, Germany, and Belgium. During his Parisian period, Amaral found an intellectual affinity with the milieu of the time as well as a popular audience which brought him critical acclaim by authors like Jacques Leenhardt and Jos√© Pierre. His drawings from the 1970s often treat subjects in an erotic and sensual manner with a realistic style. \\"I hear people saying that my artworks are erotic. I don't think so. But then I am surprised - almost confused - when I see how annoyed people get when they see a penis\\". He typically depicts fragmented body parts, human sexual organs, flowers that bloom lips or ears as petals, and biomorphic beings. Invisible Flowers is one of his most remarkable creations from this period. The title alludes to Invisible Cities, written by Italo Calvino, a friend of the artist during his years in Paris. His work from this period also comes in the form of collages and assemblages with antique boxes, old photographs, antique books, and antique colonial furniture. The surrealist roots of these creations are evident. left  Painting in the 1980s  Moon Dedicated to Memories N. 95, 1990; 59 √ó 47 cm; acrylic paint on linen. In 1980 Amaral returned to Bogot√°. In the following two decades he worked with oil and acrylic paint, rendering meditative compositions with shadowed and earthy palettes. His finesse finds expression in this medium as well. Amongst them, a series titled Mourning Fruit, characterized by various arrangements of dried and mummified fruits placed on intricate varieties of patterned surfaces with celestial bodies hanging somberly or luminously in the sky. \\"My paintings are dense, they have layers and layers of acrylic paint; thus, as I saturate the space, the possibility of the void expands (...) The fruit is a contradiction, because although itself it means life, at the same time it is dry, soft or stony, that is to say, lonely\\". In the tradition of vanitas and memento mori, with these paintings the artist reflects on death, decay and the passage of time. Dead Poet 4, 1992; 53 √ó 46 √ó 28 cm; bronze.  Sculpture in the 1990s  In his early career, looking for identity as an artist, Amaral experimented with visual arts branches and techniques. In 1959 he started making his first sculptures and casting them at Gerardo Ben√≠tez Foundry, the only casting site in Bogot√° at the time. But the process and the effects were very disappointing for the artist and because of those technical difficulties he soon left sculpture for collages and drawing. Again, in 1989, on a trip accompanying his wife Olga de Amaral to an exhibition site in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, the artist discovered Shidoni Foundry, where he was able to cast his visually recognizable three-dimensional creations. His cire-perdue bronzes from this period are characterized by mythological themes, metamorphosis, death, the human condition and the mysteries of the cosmos. \\"I've been asking myself insistently and for many years how it is to die. To leave one darkness in order to enter another semidarkness, the one that belongs to death. A lot of this is embodied in my sculptures and that's why this question upsets me profoundly. No one has ever seen this in my creations and it might not even be like this, but in this journey between the two darknesses I put all my effort\\". Often his figures are depicted with small heads, absent facial features, and gender ambiguities. The sensuality that characterized his earlier two-dimensional creations takes on new veneers in the textures and refined patinas of his bronzes, in which he also explores solidity and monumentality. Eduardo Serrano speaks of the creatures rendered in these bronzes as expectant and concerned for the future with ‚Äúcomposed anxiety.‚Äù William Ospina in his literary and poetic essay, points the irony in Amaral's bronze sculptures from the 90s.  Cuerpos pintados  In 2003 a Chilean photographer Roberto Edwards invited Jim Amaral to participate in his non-profit project Taller experimental. Cuerpos pintados (painted bodies). Amaral decided to work with midgets from the community of Santiago de Chile. The artist painted the bodies of his models and characterised them as if they were angels, demons and cupids spreading love. In another, later series, he transformed them in live versions of some of his sculptures. The project had as its aim a wider recognition of a human body and appreciation for its diversity. Table Two Hands, 2008; 70 √ó 25 √ó 25 cm; mixed technique. Cubicle: Stair, 2014; 26 √ó 16 √ó 17 cm; bronze.  Recent work  As a mature artist Amaral has focused on the creation of watercolor and ink drawings, artist's books, and an array of single-edition bronze sculptures. His bronzes have, in recent years, made a departure from human and animal figures towards desolate geometrical landscapes, ashen carts, and timeless machines that appear simultaneously futuristic and archaic, caught in a time beyond death. Mute and undecipherable, these artefacts inhabit a dimension where movement, time and sound disobey the laws of reality as we know them. Planes shift, cubes resonate, wheels spin, and spheres revolve. With these vehicles, these worlds, at once static and fluid, Amaral questions the preconceptions often imposed upon art and the determinism of science, reminding the spectator that our lives are bound inevitably by the dark mystery of existence.

She also established the Indianapolis Kindergarten and Primary Normal Training School at her Indianapolis home in 1882. Renamed the Teachers College of Indianapolis in 1905, she served as its president until her death in 1926. Four years later it became part of the education department at Butler University. Early life and education Eliza Ann Cooper was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on March 5, 1854, to Jacob and Mary Jane (Core) Cooper.Ray E. Boomhower, \\"Eliza Blaker\\" in The eldest of three children, Eliza was raised in a family that struggled financially, especially after her father, an abolitionist Quaker, enlisted in the Union army during the American Civil War. He died in 1869, when Eliza was fifteen. Her mother was a seamstress in Philadelphia. Instead of pulling Eliza out of school to work in the cotton mills, Mary Jane supported her daughter's interest in becoming a teacher. Eliza attended public school and graduated from Girls Normal School of Philadelphia, a teacher's college as class valedictorian in June 1874. After graduation she taught for two years in the Philadelphia public schools.James, James, and Boyer, eds., p. 169. Cooper first became interested in kindergarten education in 1876, when she attended the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia and saw a kindergarten demonstration presented by Ruth Burritt, a Boston educator. Cooper completed training at Burritt's kindergarten training school in Philadelphia in 1880 and began her long-time career as a kindergarten educator.Boomhower, \\"'The Thing is Right!'\\", Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, p. 32. Marriage family Cooper married Louis J. Blaker, a childhood friend, on September 15, 1880. The couple had no children. He died of a heart attack in 1913.James, James, and Boyer, eds., pp. 169‚Äì70.Boomhower, \\"'The Thing is Right!'\\", Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, p. 37. Career Kindergarten educator In 1882, when the Hadley Roberts Academy, a private school for affluent families in Indianapolis, began its search for a kindergarten teacher, Burrito recommended Blaker for the position. Black accepted the job and moved to Indianapolis with her husband.Boomhower, \\"'The Thing is Right!'\\", Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, p. 33. Shortly after the move to Indianapolis, Blaker left the academy to help the Children's Aid Society, founder of the Indianapolis Free Kindergarten Society, established free kindergartens for the city's impoverished children.In Indianapolis the free kindergarten movement began in 1881, when a kindergarten was set up on a trial basis in a corridor of an Indianapolis elementary school. See Boomhower, \\"Eliza Blaker\\" in Indiana's 200, p. 25. Because many of the children lacked sufficient clothing or food, the Society sought donations from the community to help obtain the necessary items. The city's free kindergartens also provided services similar to the settlement houses of that era to assist recent immigrants. The Indianapolis Free Kindergarten and Children's Aid Society incorporated in 1884, the same year that Blaker was selected as its first superintendent. She retained the position until her death in 1926. In its early years Indianapolis's free kindergartens were privately funded through membership dues, community donations, and fund-raising events. In 1901 the Indiana General Assembly passed legislation permitting a portion of local property taxes in towns with a population exceeding 6,000 to be used for the financial support of local kindergartens.Boomhower, \\"'The Thing is Right!'\\", Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, p. 34. By the mid-1910s the Society had established as many as sixty free kindergartens in Indianapolis under Blaker's direction. Blaker viewed kindergarten teaching as an extended form of mothering. As a result, her school had only female teachers. Blaker explained: \\"Every school teacher is a foster mother. She is helping the mother in the rearing of her children. The teacher that has not a great mother heart should not have charge of your children in a school room for a number of hours every day. School teaching would be drudgery if we did not love it. It would be abject slavery to any one who did not love children. We must love little children if we are going to help them.\\"As quoted in Erin J. Gobel, Three Necessary Things: The Indianapolis Free Kindergarten and Children‚Äôs Aid Society, 1880‚Äì1920, (Thesis, Indiana University, 2010), p. 21. Under Blaker's direction, Indianapolis's free kindergartens gained a national reputation among educators. Based on the theories of Frederich Froebel and Elizabeth Palmer Peabody, Blaker's schools sought to provide students with \\"a wholesome environment\\" and denounced corporal punishment when a child misbehaved.Boomhower, \\"'The Thing is Right!'\\", Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, pp. 32, 34. Instead, Blaker encouraged parents and teachers to discover the underlying reasons for a child's behavior and to find a solution that avoided violence. Blaker's methods also included efforts to involve the whole family in the child's education. In 1884 she organized a mothers' club that provided an opportunity for social gatherings as well as classes on child care and early child development. In 1889 Blaker's schools offered Saturday classes on domestic training and household management for older girls and manual arts for boys.Boomhower, \\"'The Thing is Right!'\\", Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, pp. 34‚Äì35. Founder, teacher training school In addition to establishing kindergarten schools, Blaker also identified the need to provide well-trained kindergarten teachers. To help satisfy the demand, she established a teacher training school in 1882.Boomhower, \\"'The Thing is Right!'\\", Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, p. 36. The Indianapolis Kindergarten and Primary Normal Training School, which the locals sometimes referred to as \\"Mrs. Blaker's College,\\" began at her home. As its enrollment increased the school moved to several locations in Indianapolis. It became the Teachers College of Indianapolis in 1905. It 1930, four years after Blaker's death, the school became part of Butler University's education department.Boomhower, \\"Eliza Blaker\\" in Indiana's 200, pp. 24‚Äì25. In 1883 Blaker had twelve students and within a decade that number had jumped to 344.Gobel, p. 14. In 1905 the school became formally known as the Teachers College of Indianapolis. By 1907 a total of 49,353 children had enrolled in thirty-five free kindergartens in Indianapolis and upwards of 5,500 teachers had been trained under Blaker's tenure. The Teachers College incorporated in 1914 and Blaker served as its president until her death in 1926. The training school's faculty and students were all women. Blaker maintained strict standards for the school, whose teacher trainees had a nightly curfew, followed a dress code, and attended mandatory religious services.Boruff, pp. 48‚Äì50. Blaker became a leader in the International Kindergarten Union and the National Education Association. Several graduates of her school went on to establish kindergarten programs in other Indiana cities, such as Evansville, Lafayette, and Bloomington, and in other states, including Tennessee, Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania.Boomhower, \\"Eliza Blaker\\" in Indiana's 200, p. 25. Other interests In addition to her work as an educator, Blaker had other civic interests. She was foundress and president of the Indianapolis Council of Women and a member of the Woman's Rotary Club and Indianapolis's Contemporary Club. In the aftermath of the Great Flood of 1913, she chaired a women's relief committee in Indianapolis to assist local citizens recover from the disaster. Blaker also was a member of Indianapolis's Second Presbyterian Church.Boruff, p. 121. Death and legacy Blacker suffered a heart attack and died at her home on December 4, 1926, at the age of 72. Her remains are interred Indianapolis's Crown Hill Cemetery. Blaker was known for her love of teaching. According to Lois Hufford, one of the founders of the Indianapolis Children's Aid Society, \\"The welfare of the child and the home was always first in her thought.\\"Boomhower, \\"'The Thing is Right!'\\", Traces of Indiana and Midwestern History, pp. 34, 36. In 1930, four years after Blaker's death, the Teacher's College became part of Butler University. In 1952 kindergarten education was incorporated into the Indianapolis Public Schools. Honors and tributes * In 1917 Hanover College in Hanover, Indiana, conferred an honorary doctorate degree on Blaker. * In 1926 the Indianapolis News named Blaker one of the \\"ten greatest women\\" then living in Indiana. * On January 27, 1934, alumnae and faculty of the Teachers College of Indianapolis established the Eliza A. Blaker Club. The group established a room in her honor at Butler University in 1943. (The Eliza Blaker Memorial Room is in Butler's Irwin Library.) * In 1958 the Indianapolis Public Schools named an elementary school in her honor. * Eliza A. Blaker Memorial Scholarship at Butler University is awarded annually to students enrolled in Butler's College of Education.

The company is headquartered in New York City and has offices across Europe. First established in 2010, the company traded $75 million in 2014 since its foundation. The company provides services that allow the public to recycle diamonds that are no longer wanted or needed. History Ben Burne and Andrew Brown launched WP Diamonds in February 2012. The parent company, White Pine Trading LLC, was created with the aim to increase the use of recycled diamonds in new manufacturing. The online purchasing system allows customers from around the world to submit information about their diamond, watch or jewelry online and receive a price quote. Customers then send their items in or schedule an appointment to receive a final price offer. A month after the creation of WP Diamonds' online purchasing system, they expanded into the United Kingdom opening their first offices in Birmingham. At this time WP Diamonds also operated from offices in Barcelona, Spain and in 2013 WP Diamonds expanded their operations into Canada, where they began purchasing GIA certified and international laboratory certified diamonds from Canadian citizens. In 2018, WP Diamonds launched in Asia opening an office in Hong Kong. By the end of 2012, Rough & Polished stated that WP Diamonds' parent company had become one of the largest dedicated diamond recycling companies. In February 2013, the parent company featured in Le Bijoutier International magazine and around the same time they also featured in Contraste. It was stated during an interview with Professional Jeweller, that the company would be selling the Recycled Diamonds to jewelry retailers, jewelry manufacturers, diamond manufacturers and diamond dealers. The company then went on to feature in Jewellery Focus Magazine. In 2014, WP Diamonds received an A+ rating from the Better Business Bureau and announced they would also be offering a purchasing solution for used watches and designer jewelry. They again featured in Reuters following a strong year for the Recycled Diamond market as a whole. In addition, WP Diamonds claims on their website to have traded approximately $75 million of recycled diamonds and diamond jewelry in 2014. Recycling of diamonds WP Diamonds traditionally recycles diamonds and trades them back into the US jewelry market. They are typically purchased by jewelry manufacturers, diamond manufacturers, and dealers. Larger diamonds are handled by a number of certified bodies, but are also resold to a similar end user. The Recycled Diamond market is much larger than many anticipated. Companies such as Sotheby's and Christie‚Äôs reported huge quantities of very recycled diamonds passing through their auction houses, many of which ended up with processors such as WP Diamonds. Tacy a leading researcher in the diamond market, valued the entire industry at $1.2 billion in 2012. While there is a market for recycled diamonds from companies and industry, WP Diamonds focuses the majority of its operations on buying from the public often with old or unwanted diamond rings. Diamonds that are recycled using this method traditionally go through a number of steps. Diamond buying companies often use a 4-step process buying diamonds from a member of the public. Initially, a valuation of the diamond will take place over the telephone or via email. People can expect to receive 20%-65% of what they paid originally, depending upon where and when they acquired the piece. During this step, the Weight (carat), Condition, Shape, Clarity, Color, Fluorescence, and Cut Grade will be evaluated. Also included in this step is the price for the additional materials with the diamond, such as gold or platinum, if it is a ring. Once the initial evaluation is completed, the buyer will need to see the ring. There are a number of ways this can take place, but some buyers do provide specialist delivery services, so the item can be safely sent via FedEx or UPS or through the postal system. Once the ring has been received a detailed inspection will take place in order to ensure the diamond is the quality detailed and expected. A final offer will be made and then payment would be discussed. A consumer should expect to receive funds within 24 hours. It was stated in a report published by WP Diamonds that the recycling market was vastly focused into a number of areas. One statistic suggested that 30% of those disposing of their diamonds via WP Diamonds were in fact doing so to later upgrade to a more expensive diamond item.

It is the successor to the OnePlus One. OnePlus revealed the phone on 28 July 2015 via virtual reality, using Google's Cardboard visor and their own app. OnePlus sold out 30,000 units of the OnePlus 2 in China within 64 seconds after launching the product sale. Development On 25 January 2015, OnePlus announced the smartphone's official name as OnePlus 2. It was also later reported that the OnePlus 2 would have a late 2015 release, possibly due to hardware issues with its processor. In early-April 2015, OnePlus confirmed the OnePlus 2 will not feature wireless charging and NFC. Subsequently, (on 29 June 2015), it was confirmed that the device will also feature a fingerprint sensor, which is similar to Apple's Touch ID. In October 2015, OnePlus co- founder Carl Pei said that the OnePlus 2 will be the only flagship from the company for the year 2015, but another phone, called the OnePlus X, was released. Release and distribution Invite system OnePlus posted that it will use an invite system to handle sales of the OnePlus 2, exclusively through the company's website, like the OnePlus One. OnePlus claims that the invite system is more efficient than the invite system used for the sales of the OnePlus One, the OnePlus 2's predecessor. According to co-founder Carl Pei, there will be 30 to 50 times more invites from the start to match the greater demand for the OnePlus 2. Within 72 hours of being launched, the OnePlus 2 had already accumulated over 1 million reservations. Within one week after being launched, the OnePlus 2 had accumulated over 2 million reservations. As of September 2015, it has accumulated over 5 million reservations. Open sales In September, 2015, the OnePlus 2 became available in Israel without an invite, through its exclusive distributor, C-DATA. This came after buyers complained of buying the OnePlus 2 (without an invite) that came preloaded with malware. On 12 October 2015, OnePlus held its first open-sale for 1 hour from 12-1 PM HKT/CEST/PDT exclusively to 32 countries via the company's website, with the exception of China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Israel and Singapore. This did not go flawlessly as the website's back-end could not handle the load. Due to this, the 1 hour sale was extended for another hour. In India, the sale ran for the entire day via sales partner Amazon.in. A week later (on 19 October 2015), Malaysian carrier Maxis offered the OnePlus 2 invite-free for MYR 1788 ($420) exclusively via the Maxis Website. Specifications Design and hardware The OnePlus 2 features a revamped design meant to put it at the top with the rest of its flagship competitors. The handset incorporates an aluminum-magnesium alloy chassis, with the volume and power keys along with the new notifications control switch featuring a polished stainless steel accent and with the rear of the phone accompanied with a textured Sandstone Black plastic back cover. User also have the choice to customize back covers with choices of Kevlar or assorted wood offerings including bamboo, black apricot, and rosewood. Compared to its predecessor the phone is 1 mm shrunken height and width-wise but 8% thicker and heavier due in part to its larger 3,300 mAh battery. The OnePlus 2 and its predecessor, the OnePlus One, have comparable displays, each 5.5\\" LCD 1920 x 1080 full HD resolution screens, with Corning Gorilla Glass protection. New to the OnePlus 2 is its fingerprint sensor which can optionally serve as a capacitive home button, along with back and multitasking navigation keys, but they can be disabled in favor of customizable navigation \\"soft keys\\" rendered on-screen. There are two versions of the OnePlus 2. The White Basic version features 16 GB internal storage, and 3 GB LPDDR4 RAM. The Sandstone Black Premium version has 64 GB internal storage with 4 GB LPDDR4 RAM. The handset is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 v2.1 64-bit octa-core chip purposefully underclocked to 1.8 GHz to avoid any overheating issues. The system on chip also includes an Adreno 430 graphics processor clocked at 630 MHz. For its rear-facing camera, the OnePlus 2 utilizes an OmniVision OV13860 13-megapixel image sensor with features including a 1/2.6-inch sensor size, f/2.0 aperture, laser autofocus, optical image stabilization, dual tone LED flash, 4K and slow motion 720p video recording ability. Compared to its competitors the Samsung Galaxy S6 and LG G4 which both have 16-megapixel sensors, the smaller megapixel count of the OnePlus 2, \\"allows for individual pixels to be made bigger. Bigger pixels capture more light per pixel than smaller ones and this, in turn, reduces the amount of digital noise or 'grain' showing up in photos, especially in low light situations.\\" The front-facing camera contains a wide-angle 5-megapixel camera. Other features include a dual SIM (nano SIM) card layout with 4G LTE compatibility and the handset is the first smartphone with a worldwide release to feature a USB-C port. However features left out with controversy include lack of NFC hardware and quick charge capabilities found on many other flagships and resulting in full charges that could exceed 3 hours according to OnePlus. OnePlus explained that NFC was not used by enough OnePlus One users for NFC to reasonably be added to the OnePlus 2. Unlike the One Plus One, which shipped a single model worldwide, the 2 will ship different models per region (like most other manufacturers). As a consequence of this, 4G (LTE) connectivity may not be possible outside the region the phone was bought, due to different LTE standards. The phone has an alert slider at the upper edge with 3 notification profiles : None, Priority and All. Software The OnePlus 2 comes preloaded with Android 5.1.1 \\"Lollipop\\" with OnePlus' OxygenOS version 2.0 on top of it. An update to OxygenOS version 2.2.1 was released for the OnePlus 2 in Feb 2016. In May 2016, OnePlus released an OTA update of Oxygen OS 3.0 with Android Marshmallow for its OnePlus 2 users. Oneplus released an updated version of Oxygen OS (OOS3.5.5) on Christmas Eve, this update mainly covered VoLTE, gesture updates, enhanced UI and defect fixes. However, there were frequent network drop issues that led the Oneplus team to stop the OTA. The Oneplus Team quickly responded with fixing the defect and releasing the next version of Oxygen OS (OOS 3.5.6) that fixed all possible issues. Despite telling consumers that the OnePlus 2 would be updated to Android 7 \\"Nougat\\", it was eventually confirmed that this was not to happen, leaving the device on the older Android 6.0.1. OnePlus released OxygenOS 3.6.0 in July 2017, with included Android security patch level 1 June 2017 and small fixes. It received an update OxygenOS 3.6.1 in October 2017, with included Android security patches, WPA2 security issues and general bug fixes & improvement.

It became popular in South Korea in 2010, and since then it has become a worldwide trend. Varieties of foods, ranging from pizza to noodles, are consumed in front of a camera. Mukbang is usually prerecorded or streamed live through a webcast on streaming platforms such as AfreecaTV, YouTube, and Twitch. Based on the attractiveness of real-time and interactive aspects, eating shows are expanding their influence in internet broadcasting platforms and serve as a virtual community and a venue for active communication among active internet users. Etymology The word mukbang () is a portmanteau of the Korean words for \\"eating\\" () and \\"broadcast\\" (). An English morphological equivalent could be eatcast. Historical background Korea has traditionally had a food culture based on healthy eating practices and strict etiquette. Recently, however, a new food culture is emerging in Korea characterized by internet eating culture (mukbang). First introduced on the real-time internet TV service AfreecaTV in 2009, it now has become a trend in cable channels as well as terrestrial broadcasting. This form of programming emphasizes the attractiveness of the person who prepares the food. Eating and cooking shows are becoming effective programs for broadcasting companies as production costs are lower than reality entertainment programs. In each broadcast, a host will interact with their viewers through online chat rooms. Many hosts generate revenue through mukbang, by accepting donations or partnering with advertising networks. The popularity of mukbang streams has spread outside of Korea with online streamers doing their own mukbang streams in other countries. Platforms like Twitch even introduced new categories like \\"social eating\\" to spotlight them. An article in The Economist contended that the popularity of eating shows can be attributed in part to the widespread anxiety and unhappiness in Koreans due to their country's long-term economic slump. Articles about mukbang have also appeared in The Huffington Post and The Wall Street Journal. The Korean word for eating show, \\"mukbang,\\" has been widely adopted in other types of eating shows, such as those featuring ASMR on platforms such as YouTube. This eating performance from South Korea has also rapidly spread influence to other Asian countries such as Japan and China where it became popular. In China, mukbang is called \\"Chibo\\", in which mukbangers make their content into short videos and vlogs and upload them onto huge social media platforms like Weibo.Yang, Mengyu. Mukbang Influencers: Online Eating Becomes a New Marketing Strategy. Uppsala University, 4 June 2019, uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1332196/FULLTEXT01.pdf. Reasons for popularity Cooking show Kim-Hae Jin, doctoral candidate from Chosun University, argued that one can vicariously satisfy the desire for food by viewing. The hosts, who are referred to as broadcast jockeys (BJ), interact with the people who are watching the broadcast through chatting. BJs sometimes claim to be the audience's \\"avatar\\" and will exactly follow what people ask them to do. \\"Food television incorporates the vicarious pleasures of watching someone else cook and eat; the emulsion of entertainment and cooking; the jumbling of traditional gender roles; and ambivalence toward cultural standards of body, consumption, and health. Food television also addresses and simultaneously perpetuates the stresses of social expectations, and sprinkles sexual innuendoes in a venue traditionally associated with maternal security.\\"Adema, Pauline. \\"Vicarious consumption: Food, television and the ambiguity of modernity.\\" The Journal of American Culture 23.3 (2000): 113. A study conducted by Seoul National University found that within a two-year time frame (April 2017 to April 2019) the term \\"mukbang\\" was searched over 100,000 videos from YouTube. Another study found individuals who watch mukbang may seek it for entertainment, as an escape from reality, or to give them the satisfaction of eating as they watch mukbangers consume the food they crave while on a diet. Varieties Other genres of mukbang include \\"cook-bang\\" (cooking and eating) shows. South Korean video game players have sometimes broadcast mukbang as breaks during their overall streams. The popularity of this practice among local users led the video game streaming service Twitch to begin trialling a dedicated \\"social eating\\" category in July 2016; a representative of the service stated that this category is not necessarily specific to mukbang, but would leave the concept open to interpretation by streamers within its guidelines. Media platforms AfreecaTV The typical eating show BJ on AfreecaTV are Bumfrica, Shuki, Mbro, Changhyun, Wangju, etc. Twitch Twitch added a new \\"social eating\\" item to its channel list in July 2016. Famous streamers include ImAllexx, Ameliabrador, and Simple Life on Air. Content creators Mukbang broadcasts typically feature a solo eater (or with friends) who would usually eat in large portions along with a few other dishes.Choe, Hanwool. ‚ÄúEating Together Multimodally: Collaborative Eating in Mukbang , a Korean Livestream of Eating.‚Äù Language in Society, vol. 48, no. 2, Apr. 2019, pp. 171‚Äì208. EBSCOhost, doi:10.1017/S0047404518001355. Most of these creators would cook their own food and show it in their content. Although traditional Korean food is the main food for these videos, fast food or junk food (e.g. McDonald's, Panda Express, Taco Bell, etc.) have also been popularly trending. Banzz At one time, Banzz had 3.08 million YouTube subscribers and held the number one spot among the mukbang streamers. In March, 2020, his channel was at just over 2.5 million subscribers. Banzz is a typical example of mukbang. Banzz had been featured on AfreecaTV, including the 2016 Afreeca Grand Prix, but turned to YouTube as his platform after controversies at AfreecaTV. He was assessed a penalty for breaking contracts with AfreecaTV, and appeared on JTBC's program Lanseon Life. He is noted for eating extreme amounts of food during mukbangs, and nevertheless maintains a muscular figure in the videos, saying he exercises an average of eight hours a day for health. His mukbang show includes Hongdae monster Jajangmyeon, fast-eating of 10 hamburgers, and Jajangmyeon mukbang. Mbro Mbro, short for Monster Brothers, is a mukbang BJ on AfreecaTV and YouTube. It was in April 2015 that Mbro started broadcasting, and they broadcast twice a week on Wednesdays and Fridays through AfreecaTV and YouTube. The number of YouTube subscribers is now over 900,000, ranking second in the BJ popularity ranking in AfreecaTV a year after it started broadcasting, and it has emerged as a star of the mukbang industry with the AfreecaTV newcomer award. Shugi Shugi broadcasts most nights of the week. Her trademark is rapidly eating up to four spicy rice cakes in a single mouthful. She started broadcasting in May 2014 and won the AfreecaTV BJ Festival Rookie of the Year award. Since then, she has won all of the BJ's awards from 2015 to 2017 and is currently second place in the rankings of AfreecaTV's eating shows. DKD DKD, consisting of the brothers DK and KD, is a channel with 2.89 million subscribers on YouTube. It is especially famous for ASMR broadcasting \\"real sound\\". In general, the food is done by BJ eating food while chatting with viewers in real time. But the real sound is said to be a good thing to eat in a short video of about 20 minutes, especially when food is eaten.

Known as a \\"big eater\\" or \\"oogui\\" (Japanese: Â§ßÈ£ü„ÅÑ, „Åä„Åä„Åê„ÅÑ), she uploads daily mukbang videos where she consumes large portions of food. She made her debut in the 2009 Japan Eating Contest, and since 2014 she has started her own mukbang on her YouTube channel.  Yammoo  Yammoo is a Youtuber who has 1.05 million subscribers. Known as big food eater (the size of food), and also provide eating ASMR. Yammoo usually cooks for herself, because big size foods are not easy to buy. Since 2016 she has started own mukbang on Youtube channel. Western versions Several American YouTubers have become popular with their version of mukbang. The concept is similar with an online audiovisual broadcast in which a host eats large amounts of food while interacting with their audience. However, the amounts of food are even larger than most of their Asian counterparts. Stephanie Soo and Nikocado Avocado, each have close to two million subscribers and there are other popular western mukbang channels on YouTube.  Monetization  This performance of eating can allow top broadcasters to earn as much as $10,000 a month which does not include sponsorships. Live-streaming platforms like AfreecaTV allow viewers to send payments to their favorite streamers. Creators can also earn their income through endorsements, e-books, and product reviews. A YouTuber named Bethany Gaskin, under the name Bloveslife for her channel, has made over $1 million from advertising on her videos as reported by The New York Times. Criticism Promotion of unhealthy eating habits In July 2018, the South Korean government announced that it would create and regulate mukbang guidelines by launching the \\"National Obesity Management Comprehensive Measures\\". It was to establish guidelines for mukbang because it could cause binge eating and harm the public health. The Ministry of Health and Welfare announced the measures. Criticisms were levied against the ministry: the Blue House petition board received about 40 petitions against mukbang regulations, which maintained arguments such as \\"there is no correlation between mukbang and binge eating\\" and \\"the government is infringing on individual freedom.\\" A study, which investigated the popularity of mukbang and the health impact it had on the public, analyzed media coverage, articles and YouTube video content-related to \\"mukbang\\" and concluded that people who are always watching mukbang may be more susceptible to have poor eating habits and feel the impulse to eat food while in the presence of seeing food. In 2020, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping called on the nation to guard against food waste, prompting state-run media outlets such as CCTV to run reports critical of mukbangers. Nicholas Perry, aka Nikocado Avocado, has shared that amount of binge eating from mukbang has taken a toll on his health such as having erectile dysfunction, frequent diarrhea, and gaining weight.MATTHEWS, MELISSA. \\"Why Mukbang Is Huuuuuuuge.\\" Men‚Äôs Health, vol. 34, no. 3, Apr. 2019, p. 28.

Incidents of animal cruelty Ssoyoung, a popular mukbang streamer, has received attention and criticism for inflicting cruelty to live sea creatures before and/or during their consumption in her mukbang videos. Examples of live animals subjected to prolonged bodily harm include fish, sharks, crabs, squid, and octopuses. Examples of videos hosted on Ssoyoung's channel included the YouTuber pouring table salt into a basin containing eels, removing a banded houndshark from its tank, then feigning fear as the animal tried to escape across the kitchen floor, pouring table salt on a live octopus, causing immense pain to the animal, and a video in which the YouTuber killed squid by cutting the animals in half at the mantle before setting the still-live heads down on a chopping board to 'watch' as she continued to prepare the meat. Numerous content creators on YouTube, including Ethan Klein of H3H3Productions and Cr1tikal produced videos condemning Ssoyoung‚Äôs actions.

It can be run in either forward or backward mode. The forward mode is typically used to determine the downwind concentration or mixing ratio of pollutants. The backward mode can be used to estimate footprint areas, to determine the origin of observed emissions.  History  FLEXPART has inherited large portions of its code from its predecessor, FLEXTRA (FLEXible TRAjectory model). The first version of FLEXPART was released in 1998 and was considered free software.

Built in segments starting in 1971, the skywalk was completed in 1997 at a total cost of more than $16 million. Since then, some city leaders have begun to see the skywalk as a barrier to economic development, as it may decrease street-level and sidewalk pedestrian traffic. Some segments of the skywalk have been removed and future demolitions are expected. As of June 2018, the skywalk exists as two disconnected segments: one from W. 6th St. near Central Ave. to an area near E. 5th St. and Walnut St., and another from Government Place and Walnut St. to the area of E. 4th St. near Sycamore. Creation A Skywalk bridge over Vine Street between 4th and 5th Streets connects the Westin hotel complex to the Carew Tower complex. In 1957, Cincinnati Director of Planning Herbert W. Stevens introduced the idea of \\"elevated skywalks\\" as a way to keep pedestrians safe from cars driving through downtown. The concept developed further in the 1960s as part of an urban renewal effort, hoping to make downtown easier to navigate and enjoy at a time when indoor, climate- controlled suburban shopping malls were growing in popularity. When the federal government agreed to provide urban renewal funds to help pay for the project, Cincinnati city's council decided to move forward with the skywalk. The first link opened in 1971, connecting the Cincinnati Convention Center to Fountain Square. More segments were added through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. It was officially finished in 1997 at a total cost of more than $16 million. Changing attitudes Cincinnati's \\"2002 Center City Plan\\" emphasized downtown economic development, and stated the Skywalk allowed pedestrians to bypass the street and led people to believe downtown was abandoned. The report stated that increasing street-level pedestrian traffic would increase economic activity downtown. Safety and maintenance were also becoming a growing concern. As the skywalk was built, Cincinnati signed dozens of agreements with private property owners for upkeep, which made it confusing to determine who was responsible for making fixes and providing security.A section of the Cincinnati Skywalk inside the Mercantile Building near E. 4th St. and Main St. In 2005, then-mayor Charlie Luken told the New York Times the Skywalk is \\"ugly\\" and the space underneath is \\"yucky\\". Removing segments In 2002, five years after it was considered complete, pieces of the skywalk started to come down. Crews tore out a segment connecting Riverfront Stadium to the Atrium I and II office buildings while configuring Fort Washington Way. In 2005, as part of the redevelopment of Fountain Square, the city ripped out a segment from the Fifth Third Center to Vine Street and a pedestrian bridge over 5th Street. In June 2008, a bridge segment over 5th Street between Elm and Race Streets was demolished. When the segment was first built, it connected Saks Fifth Avenue to an office tower on the north side of 5th Street. When the office tower was torn down, the skywalk bridge was no longer needed and removed. In 2012, the city removed an open-air segment of the skywalk over Elm St. and Rusconi Place. In January 2013, the bridge segment over Race Street between 5th and 6th Streets was removed. This bridge once connected Macy's to an office building on the west side of Race Street. The office building was demolished but the bridge remained intact for several years. The construction of the new dunnhumby USA office building did not include the use of the skywalk bridge and the bridge was demolished. Map A segment of Skywalk next to Saks Fifth Avenue. The skywalk bridge in the background crosses Race Street near 5th Street.

In 2002 he was appointed Finance Minister in the Saxony regional government. His resignation from ministerial office came unexpectedly in 2007, following a crisis involving a regional bank that had needed to be rescued because of large-scale poorly timed investment in the US housing marked. Life Early years Metz was born in a small village in northern central Germany some 35 km (20 miles) south of Schwerin, approximately two months after the end of the war. By the time of his birth the entire region had been incorporated into the post-war Soviet occupation zone which in October 1949 would become the German Democratic Republic, sponsored by the Soviet Union and in most respects operating under Soviet style political and administrative institutions. After passing his School Final Exams in 1964 Horst Metz trained for work as a Hydraulic engineer. Between 1965 and 1970 he studied at the Dresden University of Technology. He then undertook further research, obtaining his doctorate in 1972. Professional career In 1972 Dr.Metz moved south and worked till 1987 as a researcher with the Elbe Waterways and Shipping Office in Dresden. In 1987 he took over as departmental head at the VEB Water Supply and Waste water treatment Service (WAB) in Dresden. In 1990 he took a job with the District Administration as Head of the Environmental Protection Department. Politics During eleven months between November 1989 when the Berlin Wall was breached by protestors (without triggering lethal reactions from Soviet troops or East German border guards) and October 1990, when German reunification was formally enacted, the German Democratic Republic underwent a remarkable and rapid transition from single-party dictatorship to conventional \\"western\\" style democracy. The period saw the country's first (and, as a stand-alone state, last) national free election, and it also saw a sustained attack on perceived abuses by individuals working for the state during the preceding decades. In the Saxon capital, Dresden, Horst Metz was appointed in December 1989 to lead an enquiry into Abuses of Office and Corruption in Dresden. The enquiry sat till May 1990, and Metz evidently emerged more widely known and with his own reputation enhanced. By March 1990 he had joined the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) which, after more than four decades as a small SED-controlled Bloc party had been resurrected to contest that month's the election. He became deputy Chairman of the regional party in Saxony. In October 1990, the month when German reunification formally took place, regional elections were held. The old \\"single-list\\" electoral system that had been \\"normal\\" till 1989 had been abandoned: each of the major parties now submitted its own candidate list to the electorate. On 14 October 1990, in Saxony, the CDU won 53.8% of the overall votes cast which entitled it to 92 seats in the new Landtag. Within the electoral district in which he stood, the name of Horst Metz was high enough up on the party list to ensure him a seat in the regional legislature. He would retain his seat till 2009. In October 1999 he became deputy leader of the CDU group in the Saxony regional legislature. In April 2002 there occurred a leadership coup within the majority faction in the Saxony Regional government, as a result of which Georg Milbradt took over both as regional party leader and regional Minister- President from the aging (and, some said, increasingly autocratic) Kurt Biedenkopf. Milbradt had previously served in the Biedenkopf cabinet as regional finance minister, and that was the position which he now passed to Horst Metz. In the 2004 regional election the CDU lost their overall majority for the first time since reunification and Milbradt found himself obliged to govern in coalition with a moderate left-wing party. Horst Metz nevertheless retained his Finance portfolio. Ministerial resignation triggered by a bank crisis The Saxony Regional State Bank (Landesbank Sachsen) was founded in 1992 following reunification. It was broadly based on equivalent existing institutions in what had before 1990 been known as West Germany. The bank was in part publicly owned, since the Free State of Saxony owned 37% of it. Prominently associated with the Saxony bank's creation was the regional politician Georg Milbradt, who by 2002 had taken over in Saxony as the head of the regional government. (There is an institutional overlap between regional banks and regional politics in Germany that Anglo-American commentators find odd.) As the regional Finance Minister of Saxony from 2002, Horst Metz also sat as chairman of the bank's supervisory board. On one occasion he intervened to issue a board decree restricting expenditure on company cars supplied by the bank to its directors after the bank president (up till 2005) Michael Weiss had arranged for the bank to finance his Mercedes S600 and its elaborate tow bar, fitted in order to support his water sports habit. This was not the only example of executive profligacy that would attract criticism from auditors and from the press in reports produced after the bank met its nemesis, although Metz himself seems to have been an advocate for restraint in such matters. Like many bankers round the world during the early years of the twenty-first century, senior officers at the Saxony Regional State Bank were tempted into international expansion, which in this case involved poorly timed investment in a Dublin based subsidiary called \\"Sachsen LB Europe plc\\". The Dublin subsidiary in turn became part of a channel leading, ultimately, to the US housing market which the bank officers involved evidently saw as a one way bet: when the US housing market duly crashed the Saxony Regional Bank faced bankruptcy. It fell to the regional government to sort out the mess. The Saxony Regional Bank was taken over early during 2008 by the Baden-W√ºrttemberg Regional State Bank (Landesbank Baden-W√ºrttemberg) as part of a large and complex deal which also involved the taxpayers of Saxony, represented by their regional government, providing a guarantee worth 2.75 Billion Euros. The close links between the bank and the regional government, along with his own position on the bank's supervisory board, meant that Horst Metz's resignation as regional finance minister, on 30 September 2007, was widely reported in Germany as honorable, but nevertheless appropriate. Following his resignation as Finance Minister, however, Horst Metz would continue to defend the decisions he had taken to save the bank, and the way in which it was done. In 2009 Horst Metz reached his 64th birthday. After 19 years in the Landtag, as criticisms continued to surface in the aftermath of the bank collapse, he did not contest his seat again in the 2009 state election.

Through this process, guidelines, Criteria & Indicators of Sustainable Forest Management and other instruments for the promotion of sustainable forest management (SFM) are developed. The process is based on the Ministerial Conferences that have been convened with an interval of 3 to 5 years. These Conferences represent the highest decision-making body of the process, as well as its most important event. At Ministerial Conferences, the ministers responsible for forests in Europe take decisions on issues of highest political and social relevance regarding forests and forestry through decisions and resolutions. Between ministerial conferences, the Expert Level Meeting (ELM) is a decision-making body of FOREST EUROPE. On top of that, ad hoc Round Table Meetings, Working Groups, Seminars and Workshops are being established to work on specific subjects of scientific, technical or political nature. FOREST EUROPE also has its supportive structures, namely the General Coordinating Committee (GCC) that coordinates the FOREST EUROPE work and advises the Liaison Unit on implementation of FOREST EUROPE decisions and on strategic developments. The Liaison Unit is the support office of the process. It organises and carries out all FOREST EUROPE meetings and prepares reports and necessary documentation for the meetings. The Liaison Unit is located in the country which holds the chairmanship of FOREST EUROPE ‚Äì currently in Zvolen, Slovakia, under the name of Liaison Unit Bratislava. Ministerial Conferences and commitments From 1990, seven (plus one extraordinary) Ministerial Conferences on the Protection of Forests in Europe have taken place. The next Ministerial Conference is scheduled to take place in Bratislava in October 2020. At every Conference, a joint political declaration is agreed and different resolutions are adopted, in order to develop common strategies for its 46 signatory countries and the European Union on how to protect and sustainably manage forests.

Observers Non-European countries and different kind of international organizations take also part in the FOREST EUROPE process as observers. ;Countries (14) At the present time (beginning 2015), the number of FOREST EUROPE observer countries totals 14 non-European countries, Canada, USA, India, China, Japan and Morocco among others. This is the list of observer countries at present: Australia, Brazil, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, China, Ghana, India, Japan, Malaysia, Morocco, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States. ;Organisations (45) Intergovernmental organizations such as the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF), and the World Bank are among the observer organizations of the FOREST EUROPE process. Stakeholders organizations are also represented among the observers, having the opportunity to defend their positions and express their concerns during the different meetings. The stakeholder organizations could be classified into the six following major groups: # Youth and students organizations (so far only represented by the International Forestry Students‚Äô Association, IFSA) # Forest owners, both public (EUSTAFOR) and private (CEPF, COPA-COGECA, ELO, FECOF, USSE), organizations # Forest and forest related industry (CEI-Bois, CEPI) # Social ONGs (BWI, UEF...) # Scientific organizations (Bioversity International, EFI, IIASA, IUFRO, UNU...) # Environmental NGOs (WWF, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Pro-Natura) As of the beginning of 2015, FOREST EUROPE observers included: * Alpine Convention * Association Internationale For√™ts M√©diterran√©ennes (AIFM) * Bioversity International / EUFORGEN (European Forest Genetic Resources Programme) * Building and Wood Workers International (BWI, former IFBWW) * Carpathian Convention * CEI-Bois (European Confederation of Woodworking Industries) * CEPF (Confederation of European Forest Owners) * CEPI (Confederation of European Paper Industries) * CIC (International Council for Game and Wildlife Conservation) * COPA-COGECA (Committee of Professional Agricultural Organisations and General Committee for Agricultural Cooperation in the European Union) * Council of Europe * Council of European Foresters (CEF) * EFI (European Forest Institute) * ELO (European Landowners' Organisation) * ENFE (European Network of Forest Entrepreneurs) * EOMF (European Observatory of Mountain Forest) * European Forest Building and Wood Workers (EEBWW) * European Investment Bank (EIB) * EUSTAFOR (European State Forest Association) * FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) * FECOF (F√©d√©ration Europ√©enne des Communes Foresti√®res) * FERN * Friends of the Earth Europe * FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) * Greenpeace International * IFSA (International Forestry Students‚Äô Association) * IIASA (International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis) * ILO (International Labour Organization) * ITTO (International Tropical Timber Organization) * IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) * IUFRO (International Union of Forest Research Organizations) * Mediterranean Model Forest Network (MMFN) * Montr√©al Process * PEFC (Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification) * Pro Natura - Friends of the Earth Switzerland * Regional Environmental Center (REC) * UEF (Union of European Foresters) * UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) * UNECE (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe) * UNEP (United Nations Environment Programme) * UNFF (United Nations Forum on Forests) * UNU (United Nations University) * USSE (Union of Foresters of Southern Europe) * World Bank * World Wide Fund for Nature  Structure and functioning  Besides the Ministerial Conferences themselves, the FOREST EUROPE process has a more elaborated structure and different working modalities. Ministerial conferences Ministerial Conferences are the core of the FOREST EUROPE process. At these meetings, the ministers in charge of forest related issues in the pan-European region commit themselves and endorse decisions on forests a forestry related issues. Between Ministerial Conferences the FOREST EUROPE process works through different follow up mechanisms (see following points). Expert Level Meetings The Expert Level Meeting (ELM) is the FOREST EUROPE decision-making body between the Ministerial Conferences. Delegates from the signatory countries, the observer countries and observer organizations of the FOREST EUROPE process gather in these Expert Level Meetings to take decisions on the implementation of the resolutions and commitments taken during the Ministerial Conferences, as well as the preparations of upcoming Conferences. The ELM meets once or twice a year depending on its needs. Round Table Meetings The Round Table Meetings are a platform for information and opinion exchange. The meetings provide guidance on the implementation of the FOREST EUROPE decisions and resolutions, as well as the strategic development of the process. Working groups, seminars and workshops FOREST EUROPE working groups, seminars and workshops are organized to deal with and debate about specific scientific, technical or political topics related t forests. FOREST EUROPE delegates, as well as nominated experts take part in these meetings, the outcomes of which are always presented to the subsequent Expert Level Meeting.  General Coordinating Committee  The General Coordinating Committee (GCC) coordinates the work of FOREST EUROPE. It is currently composed of representatives from 5 of the FOREST EUROPE signatory countries, but the number of countries represented in the GCC has changed over time. The GCC is also the financing body of the FOREST EUROPE process and the Liaison Unit and its activities. It is also in charge of advising the Liaison Unit about the implementation of FOREST EUROPE decisions and strategic developments. The first two Ministerial Conferences on the Protection of Forests in Europe were jointly organized by France and Finland and then Finland and Portugal, on their own initiative. At the second Ministerial Conference, held in Helsinki, the participants recognized the continuity and guiding of the follow-up of the process in hands of a co-chairmanship and placed a structure of cooperation in the form of the GCC. The committee, on a voluntary basis and regionally balanced, was first constituted by three countries and broadened to five countries afterwards. The following countries have been a member of the GCC since the beginning of the Ministerial Conference process: France, Finland, Portugal, Austria, Poland, Norway, Spain, Slovak Republic, Germany, Turkey and, since the 7th FOREST EUROPE Ministerial Conference. In accordance with the established practice of FOREST EUROPE, one of the countries represented in the GCC is always the host country of the previous Ministerial Conference, other is the country which holds the chairmanship of the process and will convene the next Ministerial Conference, and the other three are countries which will succeed in the line of chairing FOREST EUROPE. At present, the GCC is constituted by Spain (host country of the last Ministerial Conference), Slovak Republic (host country of the next Ministerial Conference), Turkey, Germany and Sweden, which replaced Norway in the GCC at the 7th FOREST EUROPE Miniterial Conference. The chairmanship of the process was taken over from Spain at the Madrid conference by the Slovak Republic, which will host the next FOREST EUROPE Ministerial Conference. In accordance with the established practice of FOREST EUROPE, the General Coordinating Committee consists of the country which holds the chairmanship of the process and will convene the next Ministerial Conference (Slovakia), the country which organised the previous Ministerial Conference (Spain) and three more countries which will succeed in the line of chairing FOREST EUROPE. Liaison Unit The Liaison Unit is the support office of the FOREST EUROPE process. It organises and carries out all FOREST EUROPE meetings and prepares the reports and all the necessary documentation for the meetings. The Liaison Unit is located in the country which holds the chairmanship of FOREST EUROPE ‚Äì currently in Zvolen, Slovakia, under the name of Liaison Unit Bratislava. Notes References * Barbati, A.

It was designed and created by artist Sebastien Boyesen. Background On 28 June 1960, an underground explosion at the then Six Bells Colliery killed 45 miners. Caused by an ignition of firedamp, coal-dust in the air ignited and the explosion spread almost throughout a district of the mine, killing 45 out of the 48 men who worked there. The sculpture commemorates those events and is dedicated to all mining communities wherever they may be.  Construction and Moir√© effect  The Moir√© effect seen on hand and forearm Costing in excess of ¬£200,000, Guardian is made from over 20,000 horizontal strips of a special thick COR-TEN weathering steel, which allows a protective rust patina to form on its surface. Each strip is separated from but connected to the next so that, from a distance, The Guardian appears almost transparent. Close up and from the appropriate angle, the gaps between the strips disappear to give the appearance of a solid sculpture with full definition of all of its features.Artist's Book on construction etc - \\"Guardian: Sebastien Boyesen - Six Bells Mining Memorial\\" This style of construction creates a Moir√© effect where the steel sections appear to move or shimmer in the light. The statue itself is tall, weighs around eight tonnes and stands on a sandstone plinth tall. It has been compared to Sir Antony Gormley's Angel of the North. Unveiling Exactly fifty years after the explosion, 28 June 2010, the statue was unveiled at a commemorative service led by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. Around four hundred relatives were among 7,500 people from across the world attending the service. The names, ages and home town of each of the 45 victims appear on steel plates surrounding the plinth. In November 2011, Prince Charles visited the statue and the nearby visitor centre.

Both claim to constitute the official government of Yemen. The civil war began in September 2014 when Houthi forces took over the capital city Sana'a, which was followed by a rapid Houthi takeover of the government. On 21 March 2015, the Houthi-led Supreme Revolutionary Committee declared a general mobilization to overthrow Hadi and expand their control by driving into southern provinces. The Houthi offensive, allied with military forces loyal to Saleh, began fighting the next day in Lahij Governorate. By 25 March, Lahij fell to the Houthis and they reached the outskirts of Aden, the seat of power for Hadi's government. Hadi fled the country the same day. Concurrently, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched military operations by using air strikes to restore the former Yemeni government. Although there was no direct intervention by Iran, who support the Houthis, the conflict has been widely seen as an extension of the Iran‚ÄìSaudi Arabia proxy conflict and as a means to combat Iranian influence in the region. Houthi forces currently control the capital Sana Ωa and all of North Yemen except Ma ºrib Governorate. They have clashed with Saudi-backed pro- government forces loyal to Hadi. Since the formation of the Southern Transitional Council in 2017 and the subsequent capture of Aden by the STC in 2018, the anti-Houthi coalition has been fractured, with regular clashes between pro-Hadi forces backed by Saudi Arabia and southern separatists backed by the UAE. Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have also carried out attacks against both factions, with AQAP controlling swathes of territory in the hinterlands, and along stretches of the coast. According to ACLED, over 100,000 people have been killed in Yemen, including more than 12,000 civilians, as well as estimates of more than 85,000 dead as a result of an ongoing famine due to the war. In 2018, the United Nations warned that 13 million Yemeni civilians face starvation in what it says could become \\"the worst famine in the world in 100 years.\\" The crisis has only begun to gain as much international media attention as the Syrian Civil War in 2018. The international community has sharply condemned the Saudi Arabian-led bombing campaign, which has included widespread bombing of civilian areas.Saudi Arabia and al-Qaeda Unite in Yemen , Huffington Post, \\"Despite the international community's condemnation of Saudi Arabia's bombing of civilian areas in Yemen, ... \\" According to the Yemen Data Project, the bombing campaign has killed or injured an 17,729 civilians as of March 2019. The United States provided intelligence and logistical support for the Saudi- led campaign. In March 2019, both houses of the United States Congress voted to pass a resolution to end US support to the Saudi Arabia war effort. It was vetoed by President Donald Trump, and in May, the Senate failed to override the veto. Background After the abolishment of their rule, from the 1960s onwards, Zaydis faced discrimination and Sunnification policies from the consequent Sunni dominated governments. For example, Salafis in Saada, claimed al-Shawkani as an intellectual precursor, and future Yemeni regimes would uphold his Sunnization policies as a unifier of the country and to undermine Zaydi Shi'ism. Ansar Allah (sometimes Anglicised as Ansarullah), known popularly as the Houthis, is a Zaidi group with its origins in the mountainous Sa'dah Governorate on Yemen's northern border with Saudi Arabia. They led a low-level insurgency against the Yemeni government in 2004 after their leader, Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, was killed in a government military crackdown following his protests against government policies. The intensity of the conflict waxed and waned over the course of the 2000s, with multiple peace agreements being negotiated and later disregarded. The Houthi insurgency heated up in 2009, briefly drawing neighboring Saudi Arabia to the side of the Yemeni government, but cooled the following year after a ceasefire was signed. Then during the early stages of the Yemeni Revolution in 2011, Houthi leader Abdul-Malik al-Houthi declared the group's support for demonstrations calling for the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Later that year, as Saleh prepared to leave office, the Houthis laid siege to the Salafi-majority village of Dammaj in northern Yemen, a step toward attaining virtual autonomy for Sa'dah. The Houthis boycotted a single-candidate election in early 2012 meant to give Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi a two-year term of office. They participated in a National Dialogue Conference, but withheld support from a final accord in early 2014 that extended Hadi's mandate in office for another year. Conflict between the Houthis and Sunni tribes in northern Yemen spread to other governorates, including the Sana Ωa Governorate by mid-2014. Allegations of outside support On April 2015, United States National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan stated that: \\"It remains our assessment that Iran does not exert command and control over the Houthis in Yemen\\". The Houthis have long been accused of being proxies for Iran, since they both follow Shia Islam (although the Iranians are Twelve-Imam Shias and the Houthis are Zaidi Shia). The United States and Saudi Arabia have alleged that the Houthis receive weapons and training from Iran. While the Houthis and the Iranian government have denied any military affiliation, Iranian supreme leader Ali Khamenei openly announced his \\"spiritual\\" support of the movement in a personal meeting with the Houthi spokesperson Mohammed Abdul Salam in Tehran, in the midst of ongoing conflicts in Aden in 2019. Also, IRGC commander Nasser Shabani was quoted by the Fars News Agency, the semi-official news agency of the Iranian government, as saying, \\"We (IRGC) told Yemenis [Houthi rebels] to strike two Saudi oil tankers, and they did it,\\" on 7 August 2018. The African nation of Eritrea has also been accused of funneling Iranian material to the Houthis, as well as offering medical care for injured Houthi fighters. The Eritrean government has called the allegations \\"groundless\\" and said after the outbreak of open hostilities that it views the Yemeni crisis \\"as an internal matter\\". According to a secret United Nations document, North Korea had aided the Houthis by selling weapons. The Yemeni government meanwhile has enjoyed significant international backing from the United States and Persian Gulf monarchies. U.S. drone strikes were conducted regularly in Yemen during Hadi's presidency in Sana Ωa, usually targeting Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The United States was also a major supplier of weapons to the Yemeni government, although according to the Pentagon, hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of that material has gone missing since it was delivered. Saudi Arabia provided financial aid to Yemen until late 2014, when it suspended it amid the Houthis' takeover of Sana Ωa and increasing influence over the Yemeni government. According to Amnesty International, the United Kingdom also supplied weaponry used by Saudi-led coalition to strike targets in Yemen. Amnesty International also says that U.S.-based Raytheon Company supplied a laser-guided bomb that killed six civilians on June 28, 2019. An August 2020 report by the Office of Inspector General detailed that the State Secretary Mike Pompeo complied with the legal prerequisites while declaring an emergency for the sale of arms worth billions of dollars to Gulf allies like, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates. The report, however, also noted that the possible threat to the lives of the civilians caught in the crossfire, wasn‚Äôt assessed properly at the time of the emergency. The State Department was also accused in the report for violating the threshold of the AECA while approving arms sale to Gulf states. Timeline Conflict begins After several weeks of street protests against the Hadi administration, which made cuts to fuel subsidies that were unpopular with the group, the Houthis fought the Yemen Army forces under the command of General Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar. In a battle that lasted only a few days, Houthi fighters seized control of Sana Ωa, the Yemeni capital, in September 2014. The Houthis forced Hadi to negotiate an agreement to end the violence, in which the government resigned and the Houthis gained an unprecedented level of influence over state institutions and politics. In January 2015, unhappy with a proposal to split the country into six federal regions, Houthi fighters seized the presidential compound in Sana Ωa. The power play prompted the resignation of President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and his ministers. The Houthi political leadership then announced the dissolution of parliament and the formation of a Revolutionary Committee to govern the country on 6 February 2015. On 21 February, one month after Houthi militants confined Hadi to his residence in Sana Ωa, he slipped out of the capital and traveled to Aden. In a televised address from his hometown, he declared that the Houthi takeover was illegitimate and indicated he remained the constitutional president of Yemen. His predecessor as president, Ali Abdullah Saleh‚Äîwho had been widely suspected of aiding the Houthis during their takeover of Sana Ωa the previous year‚Äîpublicly denounced Hadi and called on him to go into exile. On 19 March 2015, the troops loyal to Hadi clashed with those who refused to recognize his authority in the Battle of Aden Airport. The forces under General Abdul-Hafez al-Saqqaf were defeated, and al-Saqqaf fled toward Sana Ωa. In apparent retaliation for the routing of al-Saqqaf, warplanes reportedly flown by Houthi pilots bombed Hadi's compound in Aden. After 20 March 2015 Sana Ωa mosque bombings, in a televised speech, Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, the leader of the Houthis, said his group's decision to mobilize for war was \\"imperative\\" under current circumstances and that Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and its affiliates‚Äîamong whom he counts Hadi‚Äîwould be targeted, as opposed to southern Yemen and its citizens. President Hadi declared Aden to be Yemen's temporary capital while Sana Ωa remained under Houthi control. Also, the same day as the mosque bombings, al-Qaeda militants captured the provincial capital of Lahij, Al Houta District after killing about 20 soldiers before being driven out several hours later. =Political developments= Hadi reiterated in a speech on 21 March 2015 that he was the legitimate president of Yemen and declared, \\"We will restore security to the country and hoist the flag of Yemen in Sana Ωa, instead of the Iranian flag.\\" He also declared Aden to be Yemen's \\"economic and temporary capital\\" due to the Houthi occupation of Sana Ωa, which he pledged would be retaken. In Sana Ωa, the Houthi Revolutionary Committee appointed Major General Hussein Khairan as Yemen's new Defence Minister and placed him in overall command of the military offensive. Control of Taiz On 22 March 2015, Houthi forces backed by troops loyal to Saleh entered Taiz, Yemen's third-largest city, and quickly took over its key points. They encountered little resistance, although one protester was shot dead and five were injured. Western media outlets began to suggest Yemen was sliding into civil war as the Houthis from the north confronted holdouts in the south. On 14 December 2015, the pro-Saleh Yemeni Army and Houthi militants carried out a strike with a Tochka ballistic missile against a military camp that was being used by troops of the Saudi-led coalition, south-west of the city of Taiz. =Western Yemen advance= On 23 March 2015, Houthi forces advanced towards the strategic Bab-el-Mandeb strait, a vital corridor through which much of the world's maritime trade passes. The next day, fighters from the group reportedly entered the port of Mocha. On 31 March 2015, Houthi fighters entered a coastal military base on the strait after the 17th Armoured Division of the Yemen Army opened the gates and turned over weapons to them. On 2 April 2015, Mahamoud Ali Youssouf, the foreign minister of Djibouti, said the Houthis placed heavy weapons and fast attack boats on Perim and a smaller island in the Bab-el-Mandeb strait. He warned that the weapons posed \\"a big danger\\" to his country, commercial shipping traffic, and military vessels. Southern offensive =Battle of Dhale= On 24 March 2015, Houthi forces seized administrative buildings in Dhale (or Dali) amid heavy fighting, bringing them closer to Aden. However, Houthi fighters were swiftly dislodged from Ad Dali' and Kirsh by Hadi-loyal forces. Fighting over Dhale continued even as the Houthis advanced further south and east. On 31 March 2015, Hadi loyalists clashed with the Houthis and army units loyal to Saleh. On 1 April 2015, a pro-Houthi army brigade was said to have \\"disintegrated\\" after being pummeled by coalition warplanes in Ad Dali. The commander of the 33rd Brigade reportedly fled, and groups of pro-Houthi troops withdrew to the north. Three Saudi F-15Cs from 13th Squadron The city reportedly fell into pro-government hands by the end of May. =Fighting in Lahij= On 24 March 2015, in the Lahij Governorate, heavy fighting erupted between Houthis and pro-Hadi fighters. The next day, Al Anad Air Base, 60 kilometers from Aden, was captured by the Houthis and their allies. The base had recently been abandoned by United States of America USSOCOM troops. Defense Minister Mahmoud al- Subaihi, one of Hadi's top lieutenants, was captured by the Houthis in Al Houta and transferred to Sana Ωa. Houthi fighters also advanced to Dar Saad, a small town, 20 km north of Aden. On 26 March 2015, after clashes erupted in Aden, Hadi loyalists counterattacked as a Saudi-led military intervention got underway. Artillery shelled Al Anad Air Base, forcing some of its Houthi occupants to flee the area. Saudi airstrikes also hit Al Anad. Despite the airstrikes, the southern offensive continued. Fighting reaches Aden Houthi offensive on Aden Pro-government counteroffensive In Aden, military officials said militias and military units loyal to Hadi had \\"fragmented\\" by 25 March, speeding the Houthi advance. They said the Houthis were fighting Hadi's troops on five different fronts. Aden International Airport suspended all flights. Fighting reached Aden's outskirts on 25 March 2015, with pro- Saleh soldiers taking over Aden International Airport and clashes erupting at an army base. Hadi reportedly fled his \\"temporary capital\\" by boat as the unrest worsened. On 26 March 2015, he resurfaced in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, where he arrived by plane and was met by Saudi Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al Saud. Over the following days, Houthi and allied army forces encircled Aden and hemmed in Hadi's holdouts, although they encountered fierce resistance from the embattled president's loyalists and armed city residents. They began pressing into the city center on 29 March 2015 despite coalition air strikes and shelling from Egyptian Navy warships offshore. On 2 April 2015, the compound that has been used as a temporary presidential palace was taken by the Houthis, and fighting moved into the central Crater and Al Mualla districts. A small contingent of foreign troops was reportedly deployed in Aden by early May, fighting alongside anti-Houthi militiamen in the city. Saudi Arabia denied the presence of ground troops, while Hadi's government claimed the troops were Yemeni special forces who had received training in the Persian Gulf and were redeployed to fight in Aden. President Hadi meets U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 7 May 2015 On 21 July 2015, forces loyal to Hadi recaptured Aden with support from Saudi Arabia in Operation Golden Arrow after months of fighting. This allowed supplies to finally reach the port city giving civilians desperately-needed aid. On 22 July 2015, a Saudi military plane landed in Aden international airport filled with relief aid. Also, a UN ship docked in Aden carrying much-needed relief supplies, the first UN vessel to reach the city in four months. Another ship sent by the UAE also delivered medical aid. On 21 July 2015, a UAE technical team had arrived to repair the tower and passenger terminal at Aden international airport, heavily damaged in clashes. On 24 July 2015, a military plane from the UAE arrived filled with relief aid. On 4 August 2015, Houthi forces were pushed back from the Al-Anad airbase, by Pro-Hadi forces. On 17 October 2015, Saudi Arabia confirmed the arrival of Sudanese troops into Aden for the purpose of bolstering the Saudi-led coalition. In January 2016, new conflict began in Aden, with ISIL and AQAP controlling neighborhoods in the city. Other campaigns =Abyan Governorate= The Houthis racked up a series of victories in the Abyan Governorate east of Aden in the days following their entrance into Hadi's provisional capital, taking control of Shuqrah and Zinjibar on the coast and winning the allegiance of a local army brigade, but they also encountered resistance from both pro-Hadi army brigadiers and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula militants. Zinjibar and Jaar were recaptured by AQAP on 2 December 2015. In 20 February 2016, the southern Abyan also captured by AQAP linked them with their headquarters in Mukalla. =Sana Ωa Governorate= As of February 2016, pro-Hadi forces had managed to enter Sanaa Governorate by capturing the Nihm District killing dozens of Houthi fighters. They continued their advance, capturing some cities and villages. On 31 January 2020, Houthi fighters recaptured the entire Sana'a province including Nihm district from the Hadi Government. =Hadhramaut Governorate= Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula took control of Mukalla in the eastern Hadhramaut Governorate on 2 April 2015, driving out soldiers defending the city with mortar fire and springing some 300 inmates from prison, including a local al-Qaeda leader. Local tribal fighters aligned with Hadi surrounded and entered Mukalla on 4 April 2015, retaking parts of the city and clashing with both al-Qaeda militants and army troops. Still, the militants remained in control of about half of the town. In addition, al-Qaeda fighters captured a border post with Saudi Arabia in an attack that killed two soldiers. On 13 April 2015, Southern militia said they took control of the army base loyal to the Houthis near Balhaf. Mukalla city was recaptured from AQAP in late April 2016, after UAE and Hadi loyalists troops entered the city, killing some 800 AQAP fighters. On 12 June 2015, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leader Nasir al-Wuhayshi was killed in a US drone strike in Mukalla. =Lahij Governorate= Although the Houthis took control of Lahij on the road to Aden, resistance continued in the Lahij Governorate. Ambushes and bombings struck Houthi supply lines to the Aden front, with a land mine killing a reported 25 Houthi fighters on their way to Aden on 28 March 2015. =Shabwah Governorate= Fighting also centered on the Shabwa Province, in the oil-rich Usaylan region, where Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) and Ansar al-Sharia hold sway. On 29 March 2015, 38 were killed in fighting between the Houthis and Sunni tribesmen. Tribal sources confirmed the death toll, and claimed only 8 of them were from their side, with the other 30 either Houthis or their allies from the Yemeni military. On 9 April 2015, the Houthis and their allies seized the provincial capital of Ataq. The takeover was facilitated by local tribal chiefs and security officials. AQAP seized Azzan, and Habban in early February 2016. =Elsewhere= On 22 March 2015, in the province of Ma'rib, 6 members of pro Hadi tribes were killed during fighting against Houthis. On 23 March 2015, 15 Houthis and 5 tribesmen were killed in clashes in the Al Bayda Governorate. During the fight between Hadi loyalists and Houthi militiamen in Sana Ωa, the Ethiopian embassy was reportedly struck by shelling on 3 April 2015. The Ethiopian government said the attack appeared to be unintentional. No injuries at the embassy were reported. On 7 April 2015, armed tribesmen drove off Houthis who had set up a makeshift camp in southern Ibb Governorate and seized their weapons. Between 17 and 18 April 2015, at least 30 people were killed when the Houthis and allied army units attacked a pro-Hadi military base in Taiz. The dead included 8‚Äì16 pro-Hadi and 14‚Äì19 Houthi fighters, as well as 3 civilians. Another report put the number of dead at 85. On the morning of 19 April 2015, 10 more Houthi and four pro-Hadi fighters were killed. A pro-Hadi official claimed 150 pro-Houthi and 27 tribal fighters had been killed in fighting in Ma'rib province between 2 and 21 April 2015. On 4 September 2015 a Houthi missile hit an ammunition dump at a military base in Ma'rib killing 45 UAE, 10 Saudi and 5 Bahraini soldiers. On 16 October 2015, Houthis and allied forces reportedly seized control of a military base in the town of Mukayris, pushing opponents out of southern Bayda.

Military intervention =Saudi-led intervention in Yemen= Saudi soldier from the First Airborne Brigade conversing with an Emirati soldier in Yemen, June 2016. A pro-Saleh protest in Sana Ωa against the Saudi-led intervention, March 2016 In response to rumors that Saudi Arabia could intervene in Yemen, Houthi commander Ali al-Shami boasted on 24 March 2015 that his forces would invade the larger kingdom and not stop at Mecca, but rather Riyadh. The following evening, answering a request by Yemen's internationally recognized government, Saudi Arabia began a military intervention alongside eight other Arab states and with the logistical support of the United States against the Houthis, bombing positions throughout Sana Ωa. In a joint statement, the nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council (with the exception of Oman) said they decided to intervene against the Houthis in Yemen at the request of Hadi's government. King Salman of Saudi Arabia declared the Royal Saudi Air Force to be in full control of Yemeni airspace within hours of the operation beginning. The airstrikes were aimed at hindering the Houthis' advance toward Hadi's stronghold in southern Yemen. Al Jazeera reported that Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a Houthi commander appointed in February as President of the Revolutionary Committee, was injured by an airstrike in Sana Ωa on the first night of the campaign. Reuters reported that planes from Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, Sudan, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Bahrain are also taking part in the operation. Iran condemned the Saudi-led airstrikes and urged an immediate end to attacks on Yemen. Saudi Arabia requested that Pakistan commit forces as well, but Pakistan's parliament officially voted to remain neutral. However, Pakistan agreed to provide support in line with a United Nations Security Council resolution, dispatching warships to enforce an arms embargo against the Houthis. On 21 April 2015, the bombing campaign was officially declared over, with Saudi officials saying they would begin Operation Restoring Hope as a combination of political, diplomatic, and military efforts to end the war. Even still, airstrikes continued against Houthi targets, and fighting in Aden and Ad Dali' went on. The United Arab Emirates has also spearheaded an active role against fighting AQAP and ISIL-YP presence in Yemen through a partnership with the United States. In an Op-Ed in The Washington Post, Yousef Al Otaiba, the UAE ambassador to the United States, described that the intervention has reduced AQAP presence in Yemen to its weakest point since 2012 with many areas previously under their control liberated. The ambassador claimed that more than 2,000 militants have been removed from the battlefield, with their controlled areas now having improved security and a better delivered humanitarian and development assistance such as to the port city of Mukalla and other liberated areas. An Associated Press investigation outlined that the military coalition in Yemen actively reduced AQAP in Yemen without military intervention, instead of by offering them deals and even actively recruiting them in the coalition because \\"they‚Äôre considered exceptional fighters\\". UAE Brigadier General Musallam Al Rashidi responded to the accusations by stating that Al Qaeda cannot be reasoned with and cited that they killed many of his soldiers. The UAE military stated that accusations of allowing AQAP to leave with cash contradict their primary objective of depriving AQAP of its financial strength. The notion of the coalition recruiting or paying AQAP has been thoroughly denied by the United States Pentagon with Colonel Robert Manning, spokesperson of the Pentagon, calling the news source \\"patently false\\". The governor of Hadramut Faraj al-Bahsani, dismissed the accusations that Al Qaeda has joined with the coalition rank, explaining that if they did there would be sleeper cells and that he would be \\"the first one to be killed\\". According to The Independent, AQAP activity on social media as well as the number of terror attacks conducted by them has decreased since the Emirati intervention. Certification and assurance was announced by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stating that maximum efforts are being taken by the Saudi-led coalition to avoid civilian casualties in order to legally authorize the American military to refuel coalition military aircraft and to continue its support. The Spanish government initially cancelled the sale of 400 laser-guided bombs to Saudi Arabia, however, they have since reversed the decision. According to the Guardian news agency, more than 40 Saudi officers have been trained at prestigious British military colleges since the Saudi intervention in Yemen started. These officers mostly trained at Sandhurst, the RAF‚Äôs school at Cranwell and the Royal Naval College in Dartmouth since 2015. The MoD refused to state the earned money from the Saudi contracts, because it could influence Britain's relations with the Saudis. Abdul-Malik Badreddin, The Houthi leader condemned the UK's military cooperation and arms sales to the Saudi military. According to a Sky News analysis, The UK has sold at least ¬£5.7bn worth of arms to the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen since 2015. Priyanka Motaparthy, senior emergencies researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: ‚ÄúThese revelations confirm once again how the UK military is working hand in glove with the Saudis. Houthi rebels released footage and images of destroyed Light Armoured Vehicles (LAV), which are reportedly manufactured by Canada and sold to Saudi Arabia for fighting in Yemen. Former Bloc Quebecois MP, Daniel Turp has called on Ottawa to cancel its arms deal with Riyadh. On April 25, 2020, the Campaign Against Arms Trade condemned the UK arms industry of serving human rights abusers and despotic regimes like the Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Reportedly, the sales have increased by 300% or ¬£1bn in 2019, as compared to 2018. The jets exported by UK have been accused of killing tens of thousands of people and damaging the healthcare system during a crisis. On July 13, 2020, the UK Ministry of Defence logged more than 500 Saudi air raids in possible breach of international law in Yemen. These figures were revealed a few days after the UK government decided to resume the arms sales to Saudi Arabia, which could be used in the Yemen war, just over a year after the court of appeal ruled them unlawful. It justified resuming the arms sales stating that only isolated incidents without any pattern have occurred. On July 17, 2020, it was revealed that French authorities are opening an investigation into the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, for complicity in the acts of torture citing the UAE‚Äôs involvement in the Yemen civil war. Six Yemeni citizens had filed a complaint with a judge specialising in crimes against humanity, in Paris. =Arab League= In Egypt, the Yemeni foreign minister called for an Arab League military intervention against the Houthis. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al- Sisi floated the idea of a unified military force. The Arab League announced the formation of a unified military force to respond to conflict in Yemen and Libya. =Drone strikes= President Barack Obama and CIA Director John O. Brennan met with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) leaders in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on 21 April 2016 Since the mid-2000s, the United States has been carrying out targeted killings of Al-Qaeda militants in Yemen, although the U.S. government generally does not confirm involvement in specific attacks conducted by unmanned aerial vehicles as a matter of policy. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism documented 415 strikes in Pakistan and Yemen by 2015 since the September 11 attacks, and according to the organization's estimates, between 423 and 962 deaths are believed to have been civilians. However, Michael Morell, former deputy director of the CIA, affirmed that the numbers were significantly lower. During the civil war in Yemen, drone strikes have continued, targeting suspected leaders of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Ibrahim al-Rubeish and Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, two leading AQAP figures, were killed by U.S. drone strikes in the vicinity of Mukalla in 2015. Approximately 240 suspected AQAP militants have been killed by American drone strikes since the civil war began. In 2013, Radhya Al-Mutawakel and Abdelrasheed Al-Faqih, Directors of Mwatana, published a joint report with Open Society Foundations titled 'Death by Drone', detailing evidence of civilian casualties and damage to civilian objects in nine US drone strikes. Islamic State presence and operations The Islamic State (IS) has proclaimed several provinces in Yemen and has urged its adherents to wage war against the Houthi movement, as well as against Zaydis in general. ISIS militants have conducted bombing attacks in various parts of the country, particularly against mosques in Sana Ωa. On 6 October 2015, IS militants conducted a series of suicide bombings in Aden that killed 15 soldiers affiliated with the Hadi-led government and the Saudi-led coalition. The attacks were directed against the al-Qasr hotel, which had been a headquarters for pro-Hadi officials, and also military facilities. Yemeni officials and UAE state news agency declared that 11 Yemeni and 4 United Arab Emirates soldiers were killed in Aden due to 4 coordinated Islamic State suicide bombings. Prior to the claim of responsibility by the Islamic State, UAE officials blamed the Houthis and former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, for the attacks. May 2015 truce A five-day ceasefire proposed by Saudi Arabia was accepted by the Houthis and their allies in the military on 10 May 2015. The ceasefire was intended to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to the country. The temporary truce began on the night of 12 May 2015 to allow the delivery of food, water, medical, and fuel aid throughout the country. On the fourth day of the truce, the fragile peace unraveled as fighting broke out in multiple southern governorates. At least three civilians in Aden and 12 in Taiz were killed on 16 May 2015, despite the ceasefire. Agence France-Presse reported that \\"dozens\\" were killed in southern Yemen by the clashes, including 26 Houthi and 12 pro-Hadi fighters. =Omani Initiative= Around the same time in 2015 reports surfaced in the media suggesting that Oman, which is the only Middle Eastern Monarchy not taking part in the coalition and has a border with Yemen, has presented a 7-point plan to both Houthis and Saudi Arabia. The Houthis accepted the peace talks and the 7-point plan while Saudi Arabia and Hadi government refused negotiations with the Houthis. It has also been suggested that Oman was responsible to mediate a 24-hour ceasefire although analysts doubted if Oman could help bring about more rigid negotiations. The following parts constituted the planned initiative: * The withdrawal of the Houthis and forces loyal to deposed president Ali Abdullah Saleh from all Yemeni cities and the return of military hardware and munitions seized from the Yemeni Army. * The restoration of the president Abd Rabbo Mansour Hadi and the government of Khalid Bahah. * Early parliamentary and presidential elections. * An agreement signed by all Yemeni parties. * The conversion of Ansarullah into a political party. * An international aid conference attended by donor states. * Yemen entering the Gulf Cooperation Council. Sabeen square mass demonstration On Saturday, 20 August 2016, there were demonstrations at Satin Sana Ωa's Sabeen square to show support for the Higher Political Council, the Shia Houthi governing body and former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh. The head of council pledged to form a full government within days. The crowd size was variously placed at tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands. The crowd's demands were \\"quickly rejected by the United Nations and the country's internationally recognized government.\\" Meanwhile, Saudi planes roared above the population and bombed nearby leaving an unknown number of casualties. 2017 * On 29 January, the Yakla raid occurred. U.S. Navy SEALs executed a raid, President Barack Obama's national security aides had reviewed the plans for a risky attack. Mr. Obama did not act because the Pentagon wanted to launch the attack on a moonless night and the next one would come after his term had ended. With only 5 days in Office, President Trump was given the task; the raid caused several civilian casualties, with \\"a chain of mishaps and misjudgments\\" leading to a 50-minute shootout that led to the killing of one SEAL, the wounding of three other SEALs, and the deliberate destruction of a $75 million U.S. MV-22 Osprey aircraft that had been badly damaged on landing.Eric Schmitt & David E. Sanger, Raid in Yemen: Risky From the Start and Costly in the End , New York Times (1 February 2017).

Also, sometime in late 2017, in a gradual escalation of U.S. military action, a group of U.S. Army commandos arrived to seek and destroy Houthi missiles near the Saudi Arabian border. In public statements, the U.S. government has tried to keep secret the extent of its involvement in the conflict since the Houthis pose no direct threat to America.The New York Times, 3 May 2018, \\"Army Special Forces Secretly Help Saudis Combat Threat From Yemen Rebels\\" * CNN reported that on 16 October, the US carried out its first airstrikes specifically targeting ISIS-YP; the strikes targeted two ISIS training camps in Al Bayda Governorate.

The report also added per source from UNICEF officials in Yemen that within 15 days, some 100,000 people across the country were dislocated, while Oxfam said that more than 10 million Yemenis did not have enough food to eat, in addition to 850,000 half-starved children. Over 13 million civilians were without access to clean water. A medical aid boat brought 2.5 tonnes of medicine to Aden on 8 April 2015. A UNICEF plane loaded with 16 tonnes of supplies landed in Sana Ωa on 10 April. The United Nations announced on 19 April 2015 that Saudi Arabia promised to provide $273.7 million in emergency humanitarian aid to Yemen. The UN appealed for the aid, saying 7.5 million people had been affected by the conflict and many were in need of medical supplies, potable water, food, shelter, and other forms of support. On 12 May 2015, Oxfam warned that the five days a humanitarian ceasefire was scheduled to last would not be sufficient to fully address Yemen's humanitarian crisis. It has also been said that the Houthis are collecting a war tax on goods. The political analyst Abdulghani al-Iryani affirmed that this tax is: \\"an illegal levy, mostly extortion that is not determined by law and the amount is at the discretion of the field commanders\\". As the war dragged on through the summer and into the fall, things were made far worse when Cyclone Chapala, the equivalent of a category 2 Hurricane, made landfall on 3 November 2015. According to the NGO Save the Children, the destruction of healthcare facilities and a healthcare system on the brink of collapse as a result of the war will cause an estimated 10,000 preventable child deaths annually. Some 1,219 children have died as a direct result of the conflict thus far. Edward Santiago, the NGO's Yemen director, asserted in December 2016: > Even before the war tens of thousands of Yemeni children were dying of > preventable causes. But now, the situation is much worse and an estimated > 1,000 children are dying every week from preventable killers like diarrhea, > malnutrition and respiratory tract infections. In March 2017, the World Food Program reported that while Yemen was not yet in a full-blown famine, 60% of Yemenis, or 17 million people, were in \\"crisis\\" or \\"emergency\\" food situations.http://www.forumarmstrade.org/uploads/1/9/0/8/19082495/crs_yemen_report_march_2017.pdf In June 2017 a cholera epidemic resurfaced which was reported to be killing a person an hour in Yemen by mid June. News reports in mid June stated that there had been 124,000 cases and 900 deaths and that 20 of the 22 provinces in Yemen were affected at that time. UNICEF and WHO estimated that, by 24 June 2017, the total cases in the country exceeded 200,000, with 1,300 deaths. 77.7% of cholera cases (339,061 of 436,625) and 80.7% of deaths from cholera (1,545 of 1,915) occurred in Houthi-controlled governorates, compared to 15.4% of cases and 10.4% of deaths in government-controlled governorates, since Houthi-controlled areas have been disproportionately affected by the conflict, which has created conditions conducive to the spread of cholera. On 7 June 2018, it was reported that the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had pulled 71 of its international staff out of Yemen, and moved the rest of them to Djibouti, with some 450 ICRC employees remaining in the country. The partial evacuation measure came on the eve of an ICRC worker, a Lebanese national, being killed on 21 April by unknown gunmen in the southwestern city of Taiz. The ICRC stated, \\"our current activities have been blocked, threatened and directly targeted in recent weeks, and we see a vigorous attempt to instrumentalise our organisation as a pawn in the conflict.\\" In light of the serious security deterioration for ICRC personnel, the international organisation has called for all parties of the conflict \\"to provide it with concrete, solid and actionable guarantees so that it can continue working in Yemen.\\" Since the beginning of the conflict, more than 10,000 people have been killed and at least 40,000 wounded, mostly from air raids.Red Cross pulls 71 foreign staff out of Yemen over security risks.(7 June 2018). Al Jazeera News Houthis. Retrieved 7 June 2018. The International Rescue Committee stated in March that at least 9.8 million people in Yemen were acutely in need of health services. The closure of Sana Ωa and Riyan airports for civilian flights and the limited operation of civilian airplanes in government-held areas, made it impossible for most to seek medical treatment abroad. The cost of tickets provided by Yemenia, Air Djibouti and Queen Bilqis Airways, also put traveling outside Yemen out of reach for many. The United Nations Development Programme published a report in September 2019 that said if the war continues, Yemen will become the poorest country in the world, with 79% of the population living below the poverty line and 65% in extreme poverty by 2022. On December 3, the International Day of Person's with Disabilities, Amnesty International released a report highlighting how the almost 5-year old Yemen war has left millions of people living with disabilities and excluded from medical attention. The armed conflict led by Saudi Arabia and UAE as part of the former's coalition in the Arab nation against Houthis and terror groups, has given birth to the worst humanitarian crisis, as stated by the United Nations. Humanitarian aid provided to Houthi- controlled Yemen will be scaled-down in March 2020 because donors doubt if it's actually reaching to the people in need, UN official said. In June 2020, the UNHCR said that following more than five years of war in Yemen, more than 3.6 million people have been forced to flee their homes, while 24 million are in dire need of aid. The group also informed that a significant gap in funding has been recorded with only US$63 million received thus far, while at least US$211.9 million is needed to run the operations in 2020. On 2 July 2020, Human Rights Watch reported that detainees at Aden‚Äôs Bir Ahmed facility were facing serious health risks from the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic. The informal detention facility, controlled by Yemeni authorities affiliated with the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council, is grossly overcrowded and was deprived of health care facilities. War crime accusations Destroyed house in the south of Sanaa, 13 June 2015 According to Farea Al-Muslim, direct war crimes have been committed during the conflict; for example, an IDP camp was hit by a Saudi airstrike, while Houthis have sometimes prevented aid workers from giving aid. The UN and several major human rights groups discussed the possibility that war crimes may have been committed by Saudi Arabia during the air campaign. Human Rights Watch (HRW) wrote that the Saudi- led air campaign that began on 26 March 2015, had \\"conducted airstrikes in apparent violation of the laws of war, such as the March 30 attack on a displaced person camp in Mazraq, northern Yemen, that struck a medical facility and a market\\". HRW also said that the Houthis had \\"unlawfully deployed forces in densely populated areas and used excessive force against peaceful protesters and journalists\\". In addition, HRW said that by providing logistical and intelligence assistance to coalition forces, \\"the United States may have become a party to the conflict, creating obligations under the laws of war\\". Other incidents noted by HRW that had been deemed as \\"indiscriminate or disproportionate\\" or \\"in violation of the laws of war\\" were: a strike on a dairy factory outside the Red Sea port of Hodaida (31 civilian deaths); a strike that destroyed a humanitarian aid warehouse of the international aid organization Oxfam in Saada; the Saudi Arabia-led coalition's blockade of Yemen which kept out fuel desperately needed for the Yemeni population's survival. Amnesty International said that several Saudi Arabian-led airstrikes, documented by it, hit five densely populated areas (Sa'dah, Sana Ωa, Hodeidah, Hajjah and Ibb), and \\"raise concerns about compliance with the rules of international humanitarian law\\". Amnesty International added, that according to its research, at least 139 people, including at least 97 civilians (33 of whom were children) were killed during these strikes, and 460 individuals were injured (at least 157 whom were civilians). HRW also said that pro-Houthi fighters may have committed war crimes when two women were killed in Yemen and aid workers were arrested for two weeks. U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, Johannes van der Klaauw, said that air strikes by the Saudi-led coalition on Sa'ada city in Yemen, where many civilians were trapped, were in breach of international humanitarian law, despite calls for civilians to leave the area. Scores of civilians were reportedly killed and thousands forced to flee their homes after the Saudi-led coalition declared the entire governorate a military target, he said. Van der Klaauw also said that coalition strikes had targeted schools and hospitals, in breach of international law, Yemeni capital Sanaa after airstrikes, 9 October 2015 A group of 17 aid agencies working in Yemen condemned the growing intensity of airstrikes in the north of Yemen on 8 and 9 May 2015. Save the Children's Country Director in Yemen, Edward Santiago, said that the \\"indiscriminate attacks after the dropping of leaflets urging civilians to leave Sa'ada raises concerns about the possible pattern being established in breach of International Humanitarian Law\\". Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor has claimed that Houthi militias in alliance with the militants of exiled former president Ali Abdullah Saleh killed purposely at least 22 civilians in Taiz. According to eyewitnesses, the militants launched Katyusha rockets targeting the markets and residential neighborhoods in the center of Taiz. As a result, many civilians were killed and wounded. On the other hand, local media belonging to Houthi militias have denied such accusation, accusing Saudi and ISIL for committing these attacks. In December 2015, HRW claimed that six \\"unlawful airstrikes\\" were carried out in the capital by the Saudi-led coalition in September and October, which killed 60 civilians. They also criticized the United States, a party to the conflict, for refusing to investigate the attacks.Yemen: Coalition Bombs Homes in Capital . Human Rights Watch. 21 December 2015. In January 2016, local sources in the Yemeni capital of Sana Ωa reported that a Saudi-led coalition airstrike targeted the Noor Center for the Blind. On 8 October 2016, a Saudi-led airstrike on a funeral ceremony that killed roughly 100 people and injured 500, including children. HRW is calling the attack an apparent war crime.Yemen: Saudi-Led Funeral Attack Apparent War Crime . Human Rights Watch. 13 October 2016. In November 2017, U.S. Senator Chris Murphy accused the United States of complicity in war crimes and the humanitarian crisis on the Senate floor, stating \\"there is a humanitarian catastrophe inside this country ‚Äì that very few people in this nation can locate on a map ‚Äì of absolutely epic proportion. This humanitarian catastrophe ‚Äì this famine ‚Ä¶ is caused, in part, by the actions of the United States of America.\\" In August 2018 the headline of article on Foreign Policy magazine was \\"America in committing war crimes in Yemen and it doesn't even know why.\\"\\"America is committing war crimes in Yemen and it doesn't even know why\\". Foreign Policy. 15 August 2018. British researcher Alex de Waal has found that the \\"responsibility for Yemen goes beyond Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to London and Washington. Britain has sold at least ¬£4.5 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia and ¬£500 million to the UAE since the war began. The US role is even bigger: Trump authorized arms sales to the Saudis worth $110 billion last May. Yemen will be the defining famine crime of this generation, perhaps this century.\\" In July 2017, and after a challenge mounted by human rights campaigners against ministers who the campaigners accused of \\"acting illegally by not suspending weapons sales to Saudi Arabia, the UK High Court ruled that the government arms sales were lawful.\\" On 28 August 2018, at a Pentagon news conference in Washington, US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said that the US would continue to support the Saudi-led coalition. In spite of a commitment by Saudi that \\"everything humanly possible\\" would be done and no damage to innocent lives would be caused, the increased civilian casualties in Yemen war remain unexplained. UN's first report after the coalition claims this to be the world's worst humanitarian crisis, where more than 10,000 have been killed. The report also claims that the governments of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen, may be responsible for war crimes, such as rape, torture and use of child soldiers. In July 2019, a large shipment of Australian-built remote weapons systems was exported from Sydney airport. The Guardian reported that the shipment was purchased by the governments of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In August 2019, human rights groups urged Australia to suspend the arms sales to the two countries that have been ‚Äúwaging the bloody war in Yemen‚Äù. The United Nations confirmed deaths and injuries of 17,700 civilians, in addition to the increasing humanitarian crisis and displacements. On August 3, 2019, the United Nations investigators said the US, UK and France may potentially be complicit in committing war crimes in Yemen by selling weapons to the Saudi-led coalition which is deliberately using starvation against the civilian population as a tactic of warfare. On October 7, 2019, Yemeni health officials said an explosive device blasted in Wadi Nakhla, Hudaydah, killing at least four children, and wounding two others. The officials blamed Houthi rebels for the blast. In February 2019, an exclusive investigation led by CNN reported the violation of the US arms agreement with the UAE and Saudi Arabia. According to the report, Saudi Arabia and its coalition partners, including UAE, transferred US-made weapons to fighters associated to extremist and terrorist groups like al Qaeda, Salafi militias, and other extremist factions fighting in Yemen, violating Saudi-led coalition's agreement with the United States. In November 2019, US State Department and Pentagon assigned teams to visit the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia to probe into CNN's conclusion claiming that American-made weapons are being transferred for use by the separatist militias and rebel fighters in Yemen. In February 2020, British law firm, Stoke White appealed the authorities in Britain, the U.S. and Turkey to arrest senior officials from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for allegedly carrying out acts of war crimes and torture in Yemen. The complaints were lodged under the provision of ‚Äòuniversal jurisdiction‚Äô, wherein the nations must probe breaches of the Geneva Convention for possible war crimes. In March 2020, the Saudi military forces fighting insurgents and Houthi rebel groups in the Yemeni civil war, was accused of carrying out abuse of Yemeni civilians in the country's remote eastern province, al-Mahrah. The Saudi-backed Yemeni forces and Saudi's own military forces have been accused by the Human Rights Watch of carrying out serious abuse of human rights in the proxy war ongoing since the 2015, by arbitrarily arresting, torturing, and illegally transferring detainees to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. On 21 June 2020, The Guardian reported that after a strong campaign against arms trade in the UK in 2019, a court of appeal listed supply of arms to Saudi Arabia as unlawful. However, the UK government allegedly continued the arms supply to Saudi Arabia and ignored the landmark ruling that declared it unlawful. On June 30, 2020, Yemeni human rights group Mwatana reported hundreds of cases of forced disappearance, torture and killing in secret prisons in Yemen. The reports documented the cases from May 2016 to April 2020 and revealed more than 1,600 cases of arbitrary detentions, 770 forced disappearances, 344 cases of torture and at least 66 deaths in unofficial detention centers have been recorded.Further bifurcating it said that he UAE backed forces are responsible for 327 disappearances, 141 cases of torture, and 25 deaths in detention, while Saudi-backed Yemeni government bears the responsibility for 65 cases of torture and more than two dozen deaths. The United Nations confirmed that an airstrike hit the northern province of Yemen on 6 August 2020, which led to an undocumented, but large number of civilian casualties. The health minister of Yemen‚Äôs Houthi- controlled area confirmed that 9 children were among those killed, while 12 children and women were injured in the airstrike carried out by the Saudi-led coalition. On September 17, 2020, a coalition of 39 human rights organizations signed a letter urging Canada Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to end arms exports to Saudi Arabia, which has committed war crimes in the Yemen war. The letter came after a United Nations panel listed Canada among the countries helping in fueling the war. Investigation led by the Sky News disclosed the evidence of 12 July 2020 air-strike that hit the northern Yemen. It was reportedly carried out by the Saudi-led coalition backed by the United Kingdom and the United States government. The air-strike hit a family home, killing nine people, which included six children and three women. The investigators found fragments of the bomb and some of the shrapnel which seemed to be the part of a GBU-12, 500lb fin-guided bomb, manufactured in United States of America. The Joint Incidents Assessment Team is still investigating the attack. According to the official statistics released on 6 October 2020 by the Department for International Trade (DIT), British manufacturers have exported arms to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia worth about ¬£11bn in 2019. The export took place despite a halt on the sale of weapons to Saudi Arabia, for their potential use in Yemen where the Saudi-led coalition has committed multiple counts of war crimes. Britain ranked on the second number after the United States, which tops the list. As of 10 October 2020, the Britain sales were reported to have exceeded, with the UK issuing almost one record average of arms license to Saudi Arabia per day. Refugees Djibouti, a small country in the Horn of Africa across the Bab-el-Mandeb strait from Yemen, has received an influx of refugees since the start of the campaign. Refugees also fled from Yemen to Somalia, arriving by sea in Somaliland and Puntland starting 28 March. On 16 April 2015, 2,695 refugees of 48 nationalities were reported to have fled to Oman in the past two weeks. According to Asyam Hafizh, an Indonesian student who was studying in Yemen, Al-Qaeda of Yemen has rescued at least 89 Indonesian civilians which trapped in the conflict. Later on he arrived in Indonesia and he told his story to local Media. United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported in August 2015 that a total of almost 100,000 people fled Yemen, especially to regional countries, like Saudi Arabia and Djibouti. In September 2016, UNHCR estimated displacement of 2.4 million Yemenis within the country and 120,000 seeking asylum. According to the International Organisation for Migration, despite the dangerous situation, nearly 150,000 migrants from Ethiopia arrived in Yemen in 2018, most of whom were on their way to Saudi Arabia in search of employment. In October 2019, Kuwait donated $12 million to the UNHCR to support its humanitarian programs in Yemen. Salvatore Lombardo, Chief of Staff at office of the UNHCR, said that the donation will be allocated to address the issues of Yemen's internally displaced persons (IDPs). Evacuation of foreign nationals from Yemen Registration of Indian citizens evacuating from Yemen in March 2015 The Royal Saudi Navy evacuated diplomats and United Nations staff from Aden to Jeddah on 28 March 2015. Pakistan dispatched two special PIA flights to evacuate some 500 stranded Pakistanis on 29 March 2015. Several UN staff members and Arab diplomats were also evacuated following the airstrikes. The Indian government responded by deploying ships and planes to Yemen to evacuate stranded Indians. India began evacuating its citizens on 2 April by sea. An air evacuation of Indian nationals from Sana Ωa to Djibouti started on 3 April, after the Indian government obtained permission to land two Airbus A320s at the airport. The Indian Armed Forces carried out rescue operation codenamed Operation Raahat and evacuated more than 4640 overseas Indians in Yemen along with 960 foreign nationals of 41 countries. The air evacuation ended on 9 April 2015 while the evacuation by sea ended on 11 April 2015. The United States did not undertake an evacuation of private U.S. citizens from the country, but some Americans (as well as Europeans) took part in an evacuation organized by the Indian government. A Chinese missile frigate docked in Aden on 29 March to evacuate Chinese nationals from Yemen. The ship reportedly deployed soldiers ashore on 2 April to guard the evacuation of civilians from the city. Hundreds of Chinese and other foreign nationals were safely evacuated aboard the frigate in the first operation of its kind carried out by the Chinese military. The Philippines announced that 240 Filipinos were evacuated across the Saudi border to Jizan, before boarding flights to Riyadh and then to Manila. The Malaysian government deployed two Royal Malaysian Air Force C-130 aircraft to evacuate their citizens. On 15 April, around 600 people were evacuated by Malaysia, also comprising citizens of other Southeast Asian countries such as 85 Indonesians, 9 Cambodians, 3 Thais and 2 Vietnamese. The Indonesian Air Force also sent a Boeing 737-400 and a chartered aircraft to evacuate Indonesian citizens. The Ethiopian Foreign Ministry said it would airlift its citizens out of Yemen if they requested to be evacuated. There were reportedly more than 50,000 Ethiopian nationals living and working in Yemen at the outbreak of hostilities. More than 3,000 Ethiopians registered to evacuate from Yemen, and as of 17 April, the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry had confirmed 200 evacuees to date. Throughout April Russian military forces evacuated more than 1,000 people of various nationalities, including Russian citizens, to the Chkalovsky Airport, a military air base. Impact on citizens =Children and women= Code Pink anti-war activists protest U.S. Senators supporting Saudi-U.S. arms deals, December 2017 Yemeni refugee women and children are extremely susceptible to smuggling and human trafficking. NGOs report that vulnerable populations in Yemen were at increased risk for human trafficking in 2015 because of ongoing armed conflict, civil unrest, and lawlessness. Migrant workers from the Somalia who remained in Yemen during this period suffered from increased violence, and women and children became most vulnerable to human trafficking. Prostitution on women and child sex workers is a social issue in Yemen. Citizens of other gulf states are beginning to be drawn into the sex tourism industry. The poorest people in Yemen work locally and children are commonly sold as sex slaves abroad. While this issue is worsening, the plight of Somali's in Yemen has been ignored by the government. Children are recruited between the ages of 13 and 17, and as young as 10 years old into armed forces despite a law against it in 1991. The rate of militant recruitment in Yemen increases exponentially. According to an international organization, between 26 March and 24 April 2015, armed groups recruited at least 140 children. According to the New York Times report, 1.8 million children in Yemen are extremely subject to malnutrition in 2018. Both the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis were blacklisted by the UN over the deaths of children during the war. In 2016 Saudi Arabia was removed from the list after alleged pressure from Gulf countries who threatened to withdraw hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to the UN, the decision was criticized by human rights groups and the coalition added again in 2017 and was accused of killing or injuring 683 children, and attacking many of schools and hospitals in 38 confirmed attacks, while the Houthis were accused of being responsible for 414 child casualties in 2016. In mid-May 2019, a series of Saudi/Emirati- led airstrikes hit Houthi targets on the outskirts of Sana‚Äôa. One of the airstrikes destroyed several homes, killing five civilians and injuring more than 30. According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, while 4,800 of about 7,000 civilian fatalities have been caused by the Saudi- led coalition since 2016, the Houthis are accountable for 1,300 civilian deaths. According to UNICEF, two million children have dropped out of school in Yemen since the conflict began in March 2015. The education of other 3.7 million children is uncertain as the teachers have not received salaries in the last two years. On October 9, 2019, children's advocacy group, Save the Children warned of a significant rise in cholera cases in northern Yemen. The crisis caused by increase in fuel shortages has affected several thousand children and their families. Between October 2016 and August 2019, over 2,036,960 suspected cholera cases were reported in Yemen, including 3,716 related deaths (fatality rate of 0.18%). The seasonal flu virus in Yemen has claimed more than 270 lives since October 2019. Poor medical facilities and widespread poverty in Yemen due to the war waged by Saudi-led coalition and Houthis have led to the deaths of many infected patients in their homes. On June 15, 2020, the Saudi-led coalition killed 13 civilians including four children. An airstrike struck a vehicle carrying civilians in Saada, Yemen. On June 16, 2020, the United Nations removed the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen war from an annual blacklist of parties violating children‚Äôs rights. The decision was taken despite the UN finding that the coalition operations killed or injured nearly 222 children in Yemen, in 2019. The Saudi-led coalition‚Äôs removal from the blacklist leaves Yemeni children vulnerable to future attacks.

The number of children who are out of school increased to 1.8 million in 2015‚Äì2016 out of more than 5 million registered students, according to the 2013 statistics released by the Ministry of Education. Moreover, 3600 schools are directly affected; 68 schools are occupied by armed groups, 248 schools have severe structural damage, and 270 are used to house refugees. The Yemen government has not been able to improve this situation due to limited authority and manpower. Some of the education system's problems include: not enough financial resources to operate schools and salaries of the teachers, not enough materials to reconstruct damaged schools, and lack of machinery to print textbooks and provide school supplies. These are caused by the unstable government that cannot offer enough financial support since many schools are either damaged or used for other purposes. Due to warfare and destruction of schools, the education ministry, fortunately, was able to send teams to oversee primary and secondary schools' final exam in order to give students 15‚Äì16 school year certificates. Currently, UNICEF is raising money to support students and fix schools damaged by armed conflicts. =Residential condition= The Yemeni quality of life is affected by the civil war and people have suffered enormous hardships. Although mines are banned by the government, Houthi forces placed anti-personnel mines in many parts of Yemen including Aden. Thousands of civilians are injured when they accidentally step on mines; many lose their legs and injure their eyes. It is estimated that more than 500,000 mines have been laid by Houthi forces during the conflict. The pro-Hadi Yemen Army was able to remove 300,000 Houthi mines in recently captured areas, including 40,000 mines on the outskirts of Marib province, according to official sources.\\"Yemen army removes 300,000 Houthi landmines in liberated areas\\" 24 April 2018. Arab News. Retrieved 15 June 2018. In addition, the nine-country coalition led by Saudi Arabia launched many airstrikes against Houthi forces; between March 2015 and December 2018 more than 4600 civilians have been killed and much of the civilian infrastructure for goods and food production, storage, and distribution has been destroyed. Factories have ceased production and thousands of people have lost their jobs. Due to decreased production, food, medicines, and other consumer staples have become scarce. The prices of these goods have gone up and civilians can no longer afford them for sustenance. United Nations response The United Nations representative Baroness Amos, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, said on 2 April 2015 that she was \\"extremely concerned\\" about the fate of civilians trapped in fierce fighting, after aid agencies reported 519 people killed and 1,700 injured in two weeks. The UN children's agency reported 62 children killed and 30 injured and also children being recruited as soldiers. Russia called for \\"humanitarian pauses\\" in the coalition bombing campaign, bringing the idea before the United Nations Security Council in a 4 April emergency meeting. However, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United Nations questioned whether humanitarian pauses would be the best way of delivering humanitarian assistance. On 14 April 2015, the United Nations Security Council adopted a resolution placing sanctions on Abdul-Malik al-Houthi and Ahmed Ali Saleh, establishing an arms embargo on the Houthis, and calling on the Houthis to withdraw from Sana Ωa and other areas they seized. The Houthis condemned the UN resolution and called for mass protests. Jamal Benomar, the UN envoy to Yemen who brokered the deal that ended Ali Abdullah Saleh's presidency during the 2011‚Äì12 revolution, resigned on 15 April. Mauritanian diplomat Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, formerly the head of the UN's Ebola response mission, was confirmed as the new UN Envoy to Yemen on 25 April. The Panel of Experts on Yemen mandated by the Security Council, UN submitted a 329-page report to the latter's President on 26 January 2018 denouncing the UAE, the Yemeni government and the Houthis for torturing civilians in the Yemeni conflict. In December 2018, UN-sponsored talks between the Houthis and the Saudi-backed government were expected to start. The UN also started using its jets to carry wounded Houthi fighters out of the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, to Oman, paving the way for planned peace talks after nearly four years of civil war.Yemen war: Wounded Yemeni rebels evacuated in UN plane bbc.com - Middle East According to United Nations, more than 3.6 million Yemenis have been displaced in the 5-year-old conflict. The World Food Programme, which feeds more than 12 million Yemenis needs more funding to continue the ongoing operations and ramp back up operations in the north. Without funding, 30 of 41 major aid programmes in Yemen would close in the next few weeks. On 27 September 2020, the United Nations announced that the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and the Hadi government supported by the Saudi-led military coalition, agreed to exchange about 1,081 detainees and prisoners related to the conflict as part of a release plan reached in early 2020. The deal stated the release of 681 rebels along with 400 Hadi government forces, which included fifteen Saudis and four Sudanese. The deal was finalized after a week-long meeting held in Glion, Switzerland, co-chaired by UN Special Envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths. The prisoner-swap deal was done by the UN during 2018 peace talks in Sweden and both parties were agreed on several measures including the cease-fire in the strategic port city of Hodeida. A prisoner swap deal was made as part of the 2018 peace talks held in Sweden. However, the implementation of the plan clashed with military offensives from Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition, which aggravated the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, leaving millions suffering medical and food supply shortages. Other calls for ceasefire On 4 April 2015, the International Committee of the Red Cross called for a 24-hour ceasefire to deliver aid and supplies after the Saudi-led coalition blocked three aid shipments to Yemen. On 5 April, Reuters quoted a Houthi leader as saying the group would be willing to sit down for peace talks if the airstrikes stopped and a neutral party acted as mediator. On 7 April, China added its support of a ceasefire in Yemen, following an appeal by the ICRC and Russia for a humanitarian pause. Despite Saudi Arabia asking for Pakistan's support to join the coalition, the Pakistan government also called for a ceasefire in order to help negotiate a diplomatic solution. Alongside Turkey, Pakistan has taken initiatives to arrange a ceasefire in Yemen. According to analysis written in U.S. News, Pakistan's strategic calculations firmly believes that if the Saudis enter into a ground war in Yemen ‚Äì with or without Pakistani military ‚Äì it will become a stalemate; therefore, Pakistan is increasing its efforts to potentially help engineer a face-saving solution to achieve a ceasefire and end the war. On 12 April, Saudi Arabia rejected Iran's request about a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, at a news conference with his French counterpart Laurent Fabius, that \\"Saudi Arabia is a responsible for establishing legitimate government in Yemen and Iran should not interfere.\\" Australia called for the ceasefire in Yemen, because of the civilian casualties numbers. On 16 April, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon requested an immediate ceasefire in Yemen. Also he said all parties must stop war as soon as possible. Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif submitted four-point Yemen peace plan to United Nations. In this letter he pointed to enormous civilian casualties and destruction of civilian infrastructure. He said the only way to stop the war is to require that Yemeni parties form a national unity government without any foreign military intervention. Furthermore, since 21 April 2016, peace talks have started in Kuwait at the Bayan Palace. In June 2015, a solution to ending the Saudi intervention in Yemen sought the participation of a Yemeni delegation to the Geneva peace talks; the delegation came under attack in the Geneva peace talks. In 10 April 2016, cease fire agreement reached in Yemen, after months of negotiation, but peace talks were suspended on 6 August. Second Yemeni ceasefire attempt on 21 November 2016, collapsed within 48 hours. The U.S. and U.K. have put immense pressure on Saudi Arabia following the bombing campaign in Yemen and the brutal killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post journalist. On 30 October 2018, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said \\"It is time to end this conflict, replace conflict with compromise, and allow the Yemeni people to heal through peace and reconstruction.\\" Pompeo emphasized that the Houthi rebels must stop firing missiles at Saudi and the UAE, but he also added that \\"subsequently, coalition airstrikes must cease in all populated areas in Yemen,\\" aiming at Saudi Arabia. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said all the parties involved in the war need to take part in peace talks initiated by the UN within 30 days. On 10 November 2018, the U.S. announced it would no longer refuel coalition aircraft operating over Yemen. The Saudi-led coalition issued a statement confirming the decision, saying the cessation of aerial refueling was made at the request of the coalition due to improvements in their own refueling capabilities. The move was expected to have minimal impact on the Saudi effort. The U.S. still provides support for the Saudi-led intervention via weapons sales and intelligence sharing. Many U.S. senators are upset with Trump's response on the murder of Khashoggi. The disapproval of the Trump administration's support has now taken another turn as U.S. senators advanced a motion to withdraw American support from the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. The senators voted 63‚Äì37 to take forward the bipartisan motion, giving a severe blow to Trump administration, which is in favor of Saudi Arabia. On 13 March 2019, the U.S. Senate voted 54‚Äì46 in favor of ending U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen and calling on the President to revoke U.S. forces from the Saudi-led coalition. In May 2019, the Senate fell short of the votes needed to override the U.S. President's veto of legislation to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen. U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense Michael Mulroy stated that US support is limited to side-by-side coaching to help mitigate civilian casualties and if the measure had passed, it would do nothing to help the people of Yemen and may only increase civilian deaths. In July of 2020, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said he would be prepared to mediate between the hostile parties in Yemen to end the war. Other developments Armed Houthis ransacked Al Jazeera's news bureau in Sana Ωa on 27 March 2015, amid Qatar's participation in the military intervention against the group. The Qatar-based news channel condemned the attack on its bureau. On 28 March, Ali Abdullah Saleh stated neither he nor anyone in his family would run for president, despite recent campaigning by his supporters for his son Ahmed to seek the presidency. He also called on Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi to step down as president and said new elections should be held. Rumors about Saleh's whereabouts swirled during the conflict. Foreign Minister Riyad Yassin, a Hadi loyalist, claimed on 4 April that Saleh left Yemen aboard a Russian aircraft evacuating foreign nationals from Sana Ωa International Airport. Later in the month, Saleh reportedly asked the Saudi-led coalition for a \\"safe exit\\" for himself and his family, but the request was turned down. King Salman reshuffled the Saudi cabinet on 28 April, removing Prince Muqrin as his designated successor. The Saudi royal palace said Muqrin had asked to step down, without giving a reason, but media speculation was that Muqrin did not demonstrate sufficient support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. A spokesman for Yemen's exiled government told Reuters on 29 April that the country would officially seek membership in the Gulf Cooperation Council. Media reports have noted that the civil war has reached nearly all of Yemen, with one notable exception being the remote Indian Ocean archipelago of Socotra, where the war spread due to the South Yemeni insurgency in 2017. On 30 September 2019, Houthi rebels released 290 Yemeni prisoners in a move, stated by the United Nations as a revival of peace process, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. In August 2020, confidential Saudi documents revealed the kingdom's strategy in Yemen. The 162 pages of classified Saudi documents dates back prior to 2015. The pages showed the kingdom's inaction in stopping the Houthis from capturing Sanaa, despite Saudi intelligence reports. The records also exposed that Saudi Arabia hampered German and Qatari reconstruction efforts in Saada after a ceasefire had largely terminated years of fighting between the Houthis and the government in 2010. In September 2020, the United Nations announced a swap of \\"1081 conflict-related prisoners\\" between the two opponents, including Saudi and Sudanese troops fighting for the Saudi-led coalition. In October 2020, two American hostages Sandra Loli and Mikael Gidada who had been captives for 16 months, were freed by the Houthi rebels in exchange for releasing 240 former Houthi combatants in Oman. Environmental impacts Water Yemen is facing one of the world's worst Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) outbreaks. The lack of governance has left Yemen without a viable water supply. Poor sanitation and the lack of clean water has had a deteriorating effect on the health of Yemenis, which is apparent through the increasing cases of cholera in Yemen since 2015. The entire country has been affected by a water shortage and the price of drinking water has more than doubled. Drinking water has become unaffordable for most Yemenis. The problem in Yemen is widespread, thus making it difficult to reduce the problem from escalating because it is hard to supply everyone on a regular basis. The Regional Director for the Middle East and North Africa at UNICEF, Geert Cappelaere, has explained that the fuel shortages in Yemen have deepened the water and health crisis. The water pumping stations in Yemen have been jeopardized as they are quickly running out of fuel and over 3 million people are dependent on these water pumps which have been established through public networks. The ICRC has been working closely with vulnerable people where the resources are limited but aim to prevent the water crisis from worsening by buying 750,000 liters of diesel to provide clean water for people living in Yemen. Already a scarce commodity, the amount of water withdrawn from wells in 2016 reached unsustainable levels. The ICRC has also been working carefully with local authorities to provide water to 330,000 people in Aden. They have also installed wells nearby Aden to provide water to the neighborhood when they are experiencing shortages of water. Water resources have been used by both sides during the war as a tactic during the conflict. Unlike other countries in the Middle East, Yemen has no rivers to depend on for water resources. In 2017, 250,¬¨000 people of Taiz's total population of 654,330 were served by public water supply networks. As a result of the ongoing conflict NGO's have struggled to reach the sanitation facilities due to security issues. Since the aerial bombardment, Taiz has been left in a critical situation as the current water production is not sufficient for the population. Water availability in Yemen has decreased. Water scarcity with an intrinsic geographical formation in highlands and limited capital to build water infrastructures and provision service caused a catastrophic water shortage in Yemen. Aquifer recharge rates are decreasing while salt water intrusion is increasing. After the civil war began in 2015, the water buckets were destroyed significantly and price of water highly increased. Storing water capacity has been demolished by war and supply chains have been occupied by military personnel, which makes the delivery of water far more difficult. In 2015, over 15 million people need healthcare and over 20 million need clean water and sanitation‚Äîan increase of 52 percent since the intervention, but the government agencies can not afford to deliver clean water to displaced Yemeni citizens. Agriculture The Yemen civil war resulted in a severe lack of food and vegetation. Agricultural production in the country has suffered substantially leaving Yemen to face the threat of famine. Yemen is currently under blockade by land, sea, and air which has disrupted the delivery of many of the country's resources. In a country where 90% of the food requirements are met through imports, this blockade has had serious consequences concerning the availability of food to its citizens. It is reported that out of the population of 24 million in Yemen, everyday 13 million are going hungry and 6 million are at risk of starvation. According to reports there is strong evidence suggesting that Yemen's already limited agricultural sector is being deliberately destroyed by warring factions, exacerbating the food shortage and leaving the country dependent solely on imports to meet the food requirements of its citizens.

It is found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. It was first described in 1848 by the French zoologist Henri Milne- Edwards from a specimen collected off the coast of Algeria. Description Clavularia crassa forms small colonies of up to about fifty individual polyps growing from a stolon. This grows along the surface of the substrate and it, and the bases of the polyps, are orangish-brown. Each polyp is up to long and wide. The column is slender and creamy-white and the eight long, feathery tentacles are either transparent white, or colourless flecked with white. The oral surface is stiffened by calcareous sclerites. Other soft corals with which this species might be confused include Cornularia cornucopiae and Sarcodictyon catenatum. C. cornucopiae has shorter polyps and narrower stolons, and its tissues does not contain sclerites. S. catenatum has much smaller polyps and its thick stolon is brick red and clearly visible. Distribution Clavularia crassa is found in the Mediterranean Sea and the proximate areas of the eastern Atlantic Ocean, the coasts of Portugal and Algeria. It occurs in positions with moderate to high movement of water and its depth range is from about 1 to 33 metres (3 to 100 ft). Biology The polyps of Clavularia crassa are able to partially retract. When extended they feed on zooplankton which are filtered from the water by the tentacles. This octocoral is often to be found growing on the rhizomes of the seagrass known as Neptune grass (Posidonia oceanica), as well as on algae and sponges. From late June onwards, eggs are extruded through the mouths of the polyps and remain stuck together in small orange clusters. They are brooded on the outer surface of the polyps.

He is best known for his years coaching at Northwestern University. Early years McKinnon played college baseball at Northwestern University as a shortstop where he was named All-Big Ten and helped his team win a conference championship. After college, McKinnon went on to play minor league baseball during the 1941 season. He played 22 games as a second baseman for the Winnipeg Maroons in Manitoba, and 27 games as a third baseman for the Zanesville Cubs, a Chicago Cubs farm team in Ohio. For the 1941 season, he compiled a .203 Batting average with one home run. Military service USS Lexington in October 1941 McKinnon served as a communications officer in the United States Navy aboard the ill-fated . Ensign McKinnon was soon seeing plenty of action aboard the aircraft carrier. \\"We were attacked by two waves of bombers, got 16 of 18, and it is doubtful if the other two got home,\\" he told the Harry Grayson on April 22, 1942. \\"I saw the entire action and there was more cheering on our ship than at a Northwestern‚ÄìNotre Dame football game.\\" On May 8, 1942, things took a dramatic turn for the crew of the USS Lexington. The aircraft carrier was torpedoed and sunk by Japanese destroyers during the Battle of the Coral Sea. McKinnon, however, survived the sinking and served out the duration of the war for the Navy, but an eventual return to civilian life did not mean a return to the diamond, at least not as a player. After he was sent back to the US to recuperate, and Navy officials, noticing his outstanding baseball play and Northwestern University, assigned him to coaching duties with Navy football and Navy baseball teams. Coaching career After the war, McKinnon earned his master's degree from Western Reserve University in 1947 and joined the coaching staff at Cleveland Heights High School the following year. He remained there for 12 years before returning to Northwestern as an assistant football coach to Ara Parseghian. McKinnon began his coaching career in 1961 as an assistant to Ara Parseghian, head coach of the Northwestern Wildcats football team. McKinnon also coached the Northwestern Wildcats baseball team. During his 20 years as head baseball coach, McKinnon led the Wildcats to five 20-win seasons including a career-best 28‚Äì12 record in 1973. McKinnon served as the head coach of the baseball program from 1962 to 1981 and compiled a 304‚Äì391‚Äì6 record over that span. At the time of his retirement following the 1981 season, he was the school's winningest coach in any sport. He also took a teaching and coaching position at Fenn College (now part of Cleveland State University), coaching both basketball and baseball. In 1978, McKinnon received an award for 25 years of leadership and devotion to collegiate baseball from the American Association of College Baseball Coaches. He became a member of the Illinois High School Baseball Coaches Association Hall of Fame and was inducted in the Northwestern Athletics Hall of Fame in 1994.

She was a nationally known painter, and she is largely credited with the founding of Virginia Commonwealth University's School of the Arts. She was a teacher at VCU's School of the Arts between 1928 and 1969. Her art has been exhibited in the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the Boston Museum of Fine Art, and the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C. She died at the age of 103 on September 18, 2002 and was given a memorial exhibition at Anderson Gallery of Virginia Commonwealth University. Theresa Pollak's mature work features a synthesis of figurative and abstract traditions. The subjects of her work include still lifes, landscapes, portraits, and figure studies that are explorations of form, color, and space. According to the artist, ‚ÄúArt is not an imitation of nature, but an artist‚Äôs reaction to life.‚Äù Proctor, Roy. ‚ÄúA Portrait of Theresa Pollak.‚Äù Richmond Times Dispatch, October 18, 1998. She was most influenced by French post-Impressionists such as Henri Matisse whose work she first encountered at a private gallery exhibition in New York in the 1940s. \\"That my painting shall be moving in form, vibrantly alive, expressive of myself and of the age in which I live,\\" was the objective of her works. She was a tireless advocate of modern art and the power of artistic expression, writing an article in defense of the exhibition of contemporary American art at the Virginia Museum in 1958.\\"Art Teacher Defends Virginia Museum's Abstract Art Exhibition,\\" featured in the Richmond newspaper, News Leader, on 2 April 1958. Early education After graduating from John Marshall High School, Pollak accepted a scholarship to attend Westhampton College at the University of Richmond, where she earned a B.S. in chemistry in 1921. She was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate, and her alma mater University of Richmond presented Pollak an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts on May 13, 1973. Virginia Commonwealth University awarded Pollak with an Honorary Doctorate in the Humanities in 1978. Professional study From 1912 to 1917, Theresa Pollak studied at the Richmond Art Club under Adele Clark and Nora Houston. She then received a scholarship to study at the Art Students League of New York from 1921 to 1926 with artists such as modernist Max Weber and in late 1950s with abstract expressionist Hans Hoffmann in Provincetown, Massachusetts. In 1932, she was awarded a fellowship to the Tiffany Foundation in Oyster Bay, Long Island. In 1933 she was awarded a Carnegie Fellowship at Fogg Museum, Harvard University. In the summer of 1937 she studied at the Steiger Paint Group in Edgartown, Massachusetts. She also studied at the Hans Hoffman School of Painting in Provincetown, Massachusetts in the summer of 1958. Founding of the School of Arts In 1928, under Theresa Pollak's leadership, the Art Department at the School of Social Work and Public Health opened, later to become the Richmond Division of the College of William and Mary and later still the Richmond Professional Institute. The first location of the School of Arts was the loft of the Saunders-Willard house stable. From 1928 to 1930 Pollack began teaching children's classes at Richmond Professional Institute as well as classes at the University of Richmond. Student enrollment increased and in 1935, Pollak became a full-time Professor of Art at Richmond Professional Institute (now VCU). By 1948, the School of the Arts included 18 instructors and 500 students with departments of Commercial Art, Fashion Design, and Crafts, Dramatic Art, Interior Decorating, and Fine Arts. In 1969, RPI became Virginia Commonwealth University and Pollak was VCU's first instructor of art. By 1970, the school had expanded into the School of the Arts at Virginia Commonwealth University, today nicknamed VCUarts. Educator and artist Theresa Pollack was an influential teacher. Drawing from her experiences studying at the Art Students League in New York, Pollack introduced nude models to her art classes, drawing the ire of \\"middle class morality.\\" But she believed that study of the nude form was essential to artistic study. As the School of the Arts grew in the number of faculty, departments, and students, Pollack strove to unify VCUarts. She pioneered what is now the Art Foundation Program, which freshman art students are required to complete before entering their specialized department. Theresa Pollack was represented by the Scott-McKennis Fine Art gallery in Carytown and later at the Reynold's Gallery on East Franklin Street, where over 100 Pollack paintings and drawing were sold. Vice- President of the Richmond Artists Association Theresa Pollak was an early member and Vice President of the Richmond Artists Association (RAA) (also known as RAA) from 1958-1959. In 1978, she became a lifetime Honorary Member and was a frequent exhibitor with RAA as long as that organization existed. Exhibitions and honors Pollak participated in numerous exhibitions including the Whitney Museum of American Art's First Biennial of Contemporary Painting in 1932 and group exhibitions at Rockefeller Center in New York City in 1936. Annually she participated in the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts' American Painting Biennial and Exhibition of Virginia Artists and The Richmond Scene exhibition at the Valentine Museum. In 1939, she received first prize at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts' Virginia Artists Biennial. In the 1970s Pollak's art was exhibited at Scott-McKennis Fine Art, a gallery owned by her former student Gail McKennis, and she maintained an upstairs art studio on Thompson Street, between Cary Street and Floyd Avenue. Her art was shown in Richmond Artist Association and Virginia Museum of Fine Arts juried shows, as well as in invitational and curated shows at local venues Reynolds/Minor Gallery, Artspace 1306, Artspace, and Art6 Gallery. She was the first Richmond artist honored by the Virginia chapter of the Women's Caucus for Art as an \\"Artist of the Year.\\" In 1951 Mary Baldwin College honored Pollak with a solo show and the Anderson Gallery at Virginia Commonwealth University honored her with a retrospective in 1969. Richmond Magazine named its annual awards for excellence in the arts \\"Pollak Awards\\" in her honor. In 1975, she was a participant in Virginia Commonwealth University's Oral History Program. In 1971, The Pollak Building at the Virginia Commonwealth University's School of the Arts was named for her. On her 100th birthday, in 1999, Richmond Mayor Tim Kaine issued a letter of proclamation honoring her accomplishments and a commemorative poster, issued by Virginia Commonwealth University, was distributed at more than 20 galleries throughout Richmond. The poster is a reproduction of Pollak's 1930 painting \\"Maxine\\". On May 12, 2015 the Richmond Times Dispatch announced that Virginia Commonwealth University's Anderson Gallery was closed and that the Anderson Gallery Collections, including its holdings of art by Theresa Pollak, would be moved to VCU's James Branch Cabell Library. The Theresa Pollak Prizes for Excellence in the Arts, so named in her honor, has been awarded by Richmond Magazine to artists associated with the Richmond region since 1998. Honorees have included: Bosnian-born artist Tanja Softiƒá, Professor of Art at the University of Richmond (2012); television writer, producer, and director Vince Gilligan; visual artist Sonya Clark (2014); theater set designer Terrie Moore; and in 2017, painter Thomas Van Auken. Pollak's works are in the permanent collections of The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, The Chrysler Museum, the Valentine, Virginia Commonwealth University, and the University of Richmond among others.

As of 31 December 2015, the bank had 216 branches (all located in Southern Italy), serving Calabria (84 branches), Apulia (93 branches), Campania (where Salerno located; 20 branches) and Basilicata (19 branches). In 1999 the bank had 341 branches: 146 in Calabria, 45 in Basilicata, 122 in Apulia, 27 in Campania and 1 in Molise. History The bank was formed by the union of the saving banks () of Calabria‚ÄìBasilicata (Carical, found 1861), Apulia (Caripuglia, found 1949), and Salerno (Carisal, found 1956) by Cariplo. In 1996, Cariplo held 80% shares of Carisal and 63.71% shares of Caripuglia directly, as well as around 60% shares of Carical through direct ownership and through Fincarime, Caripuglia and Carisal.1996 Consolidated Accounts of Cariplo S.p.A.

The three local banks were started to merged into one subsidiary Banca Carime on 1 January 1998. Right after Cariplo merged with Banco Ambrosiano Veneto to form Banca Intesa on 2 January 1998, Caripuglia ceased to be existed that year, followed by Carisal and Carical in 1999. In January 2001, 19 branches of the bank was sold to Banca Nuova of Banca Popolare di Vicenza banking group. However, on 29 June 2001, Banca Intesa sold 75% stake of Banca Carime to Banca Popolare Commercio e Industria for ‚Ç¨1.191 billion, with Intesa retained 24.92% only. In 2002 Intesa sold the minority interests to Deutsche Bank, with a warrants issued by the German bank to BPCI to buy Carime at the same price, which the contract would last until 2006. On 1 July 2003 Carime followed BPCI to become a member of Banche Popolari Unite (BPU). BPU also excised the warrants in 2005. On 1 April 2007 Carime became a member of UBI Banca due to another merger. At the same year Carime also sold 15 branches to Banca Popolare Pugliese, effective on 1 May.

Each antibody is made of both mouse and human components and targets glycolipid GD2, expressed on neuroblastoma cells and on normal cells of neuroectodermal origin, including the central nervous system and peripheral nerves. They differ in that dinutuximab is manufactured using mouse cells, and dinutuximab beta is manufactured using hamster cells. The dosing regime differs, and dinutuximab is given in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and 13-cis-retinoic acid (RA), while dinutuximab beta can be given alone. They both cause severe side effects, including severe pain that must be controlled with morphine, and a high risk of infusion reaction that must be controlled with antihistamines and anti-inflammatory drugs. They both work by binding to neurons and causing the body's immune system to destroy them. Dinutuximab received marketing approval in the US and in the European Union in March 2015; the marketing approval was withdrawn in 2017. Dinutuximab beta received marketing approval in Europe in 2017. The antibody was originally called Ch14.18 and was discovered by a group at University of California San Diego led by Alice Yu; this antibody and several others were brought into clinical trials funded by the National Cancer Institute. Medical use Dinutuximab is used as post-consolidation therapy for children with high-risk neuroblastoma, in combination with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-2, 13-cis-retinoic acid. It is given in patients who have completed induction therapy and consolidation therapy (autologous bone marrow transplant and external beam radiation therapy), as part of standard-of-care therapy for newly-diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma. It is given by intravenous infusion, over ten to twenty hours, four days in a row.. It is also used second-line for relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma in combination with chemotherapy and GM-CSF. Dinutuximab beta is also used as a second line treatment for children with high-risk neuroblastoma; it was tested and is used with a longer and slower dosing regime, and is given on its own, although it may be combined with IL-2 if a stronger immune response is needed. Morphine is administered prior to, during, and for two hours after infusion of dinutuximab and dinutuximab beta to manage the severe pain that this drug causes. An antihistamine and an anti-inflammatory are also given before, during, and after to manage the infusion reaction. Women who are pregnant or who might become pregnant should not take dinutuximab or dinutuximab beta, because it is very likely to cause harm to a fetus. Adverse effects The US label for dinutuximab carries black box warnings for life-threatening infusion reactions and neurotoxicity, as it causes severe neuropathic pain, and can cause severe sensory neuropathy and severe peripheral motor neuropathy. Dinutuximab beta also has these adverse effects. More than 25% of children taking these drugs experienced pain, fever, hives, vomiting, diarrhea, bone marrow suppression causing loss of platelets, red blood cells, white blood cells, and albumin, hypotension, electrolyte imbalance including low sodium, potassium, and calcium, elevated transaminases, infusion reactions, and capillary leak syndrome. Other common adverse effects include retention or urine for weeks to months after receiving the drugs, protein in urine, blurred vision or dilated pupils, infections, edema, high blood pressure, bleeding that won't stop, tachycardia, and weight gain. Pharmacology Dinutuximab and dinutuximab beta each work by binding to GD2, a glycolipid found on cells originating from the neuroectoderm during prenatal development, including neurons in the central nervous system and in the peripheral nervous system. Neuroblastoma cells have this as well. When dinutuximab binds to any cell that has GD2, that cell is destroyed via cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. In clinical trials of dinutuximab, the maximum plasma concentration was 11.5 mcg/mL; the mean steady state volume distribution was 5.4 L; the clearance rate was 0.21 L/day; and the average half-life was 10 days. Chemistry  Ch14.18 is a chimeric monoclonal antibody in which the variable heavy and light chain regions come from a mouse, with a human constant region for the heavy chain IgG1 and light chain kappa. The version of dinutuximab made by United Therapeutics, and marketed under the brand name Unituxin, is manufactured via industrial fermentation using a murine myeloma cell line, SP2/0. The version marketed by EUSA for Apeiron is called generically dinutuximab beta and is marketed under the brand name Isquette, and is manufactured in Chinese hamster ovary cells. History Dinutuximab (originally called Ch14.18) was discovered by a group at University of California San Diego led by Alice Yu; this antibody and several others were brought into clinical trials funded by the National Cancer Institute. The NCI manufactured the mAbs for the Phase III trial of Ch14.18 in combination with GM-CSF and IL-2, which was halted due to clear efficacy; the results published in 2009. No company had offered by that time to get FDA approval and commercialize the drug, so the NCI kept manufacturing it and making it available under compassionate use. In 2010, the NCI signed an agreement with United Therapeutics under which the company took over manufacturing and would bring the drug to market. In the meantime in Europe, oncologists and patient advocates wanted to have the drug available in Europe, and made efforts to obtain the cell line used to make it from United Therapeutics and the originating lab at the NCI itself; when those efforts failed they reached out to a group at Memorial Sloan Kettering that had generated an anti-GD2 mAb and was making at MSK for administration to patients there, but this didn't work out either. A lab at the Children's Cancer Research Institute in Vienna, in collaboration with a network of European oncologists, had developed an anti- GD2 mAb that it made in CHO cells, and by 2011, it was in Phase III clinical trials, and the institute licensed its rights to Apeiron, a local biotech company. The FDA approved United Therapeutics application in March 2015, as did the European Medicines Agency. In 2017, United Therapeutics withdrew the European marketing authorization, and said that it was having trouble making enough of the drug to sell in Europe. In October 2016, Apeiron licensed the rights to Ch14.18 to the UK biotech company, EUSA, and in May 2017, Apeiron and EUSA obtained EMA approval to market Ch14.18, by then called dinutuximab beta.

ENEC was established by decree in December 2009 by the UAE President Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, to address the country's growing demand for electricity while diversifying the nation's energy supply and delivering greater energy security. The organization is constructing the country's first nuclear energy reactors in Barakah, in the Western Region of Abu Dhabi, and by 2020, the site will be home to four APR-1400 nuclear energy plants. Unit 1 is scheduled to enter commercial operations in 2020, with one additional reactor coming online each year until 2020 - pending regulatory approvals. Construction for Unit 1 began in July 2012 following the first pouring of nuclear safety concrete, and for Unit 2 in May 2013, in line with the approved Construction License from ENEC's national regulator the Federal Authority of Nuclear Regulation (FANR) and a No Objection Certificate from Abu Dhabi's environmental regulator, the Environment Agency Abu Dhabi (EAD). Major milestones in the development of the program so far include the completion and installation of the Containment Liner Plate (CLP) in the Unit 1 Reactor Containment Building (RCB) in November 2013; the installation of the Unit 1 Condenser in February 2014; and the setting of the nation's first nuclear energy Reactor Vessel (RV) in May 2014. In September 2014, ENEC also celebrated the pouring of the first safety concrete for the Reactor Containment Building (RCB) for Unit 3. This milestone followed the receipt of the Construction License for Units 3 & 4 from FANR earlier that month. In April 2014, ENEC inaugurated its Simulator Training Centre (STC) at Barakah, which houses two simulators identical to the plant's main control room. The STC uses advanced technology to replicate control room conditions in real time, in order to prepare ENEC operators for the start of commercial operations. In 2016, Nawah Energy Company (Nawah), was established as a subsidiary of ENEC to operate and maintain Units 1 to 4 at the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant. On 16 February 2020, Nawah Energy Company received its operating license from the Federal Authority of Nuclear Regulation making the UAE the first country in the Arab region to operate a nuclear power plant. The organization is led by its Chief Executive Officer, Mohamed Al Hammadi, under a Board of Directors consisting of leading UAE executives and international energy experts. UAE policy on nuclear energy ENEC's activities are carried out in accordance with the UAE Policy on Nuclear Energy. The policy outlines the UAE's approach to the development of nuclear energy in the UAE, and includes a series of commitments such as the decision to forgo domestic enrichment and the reprocessing of nuclear fuel. UAE legislation ENEC is regulated by the Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation (FANR), an independent federal agency charged with the regulation and licensing of all nuclear energy activities in the UAE, with public safety as its primary objective. In addition, ENEC is also regulated by the Environment Agency Abu Dhabi, to ensure the long-term sustainability of Abu Dhabi's local and marine environment throughout all phases of construction and operations.  International Collaboration  ENEC receives guidance from a network of organizations including the UAE International Advisory Board, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO), and the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO). On December 29, 2009, ENEC selected the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) to design, build and help operate its four nuclear energy plants. The overnight value of the Prime Contract is approximately US$20 billion. The contract includes substantial knowledge-transfer in human resource development, technical training and education programs, to support ENEC as it builds the capacity to staff the country's nuclear energy industry. APR-1400 deployment ENEC has selected KEPCO's APR-1400 design, a Generation III+, 1,400 Megawatt Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR), for its future nuclear fleet. The plants are designed to withstand extreme events including tsunami, earthquake and station black-out, and have also been adapted to suit the UAE's unique climate and conform to specific FANR requirements. KEPCO currently has the world's first two APR-1400 reactors under construction at the Shin-Kori site in South Korea, and these two plants serve as the reference models for the four plants underway in the UAE. Site selection ENEC's selected site to home its four nuclear energy plants is in Barakah, in the Western Region of Abu Dhabi on the Persian Gulf coast, approximately 53 kilometers south-west of the city of Ruwais. FANR granted final approval for the site location in July 2012, as part of the Construction License approval process. Barakah was selected based on an evaluation of a range of environmental, technical and commercial factors, including: *Seismic history *Distance from large population centers *Proximity to large supplies of water *Proximity to existing electrical power *Proximity to infrastructure *Favorable construction, security, and evacuation route conditions, and *Ability to minimize environmental impact. Fuel procurement In August, 2012, ENEC announced the selection of a portfolio of leading international nuclear fuel suppliers contracted to provide the organization with a series of nuclear fuel services. The contracts were the result of a nuclear fuel procurement competition launched in July 2011. ENEC's enriched uranium will be supplied by KEPCO Nuclear Fuels (KNF), which will manufacture the fuel assemblies for use in the four UAE units. KNF is a member of ENEC's Prime Contract consortium, led by KEPCO. Starting in 2014 - 2015, a total of six companies in the nuclear fuel supply industry will participate in the ENEC fuel supply program: *ConverDyn (U.S.) will provide conversion services *Uranium One, Inc. (Canada) will provide natural uranium *URENCO (headquartered in the U.K) will provide enrichment services *Rio Tinto (headquartered in the U.K) will provide natural uranium *TENEX (Russia) will supply uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services *AREVA (France) will provide uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services The six contracts are valued at approximately US$3 billion according to ENEC forecasts. The contracted fuel will enable the Barakah plant to generate up to 450 million MWh for a period of 15 years starting in 2017, when the first nuclear energy unit is scheduled to begin operations. The ENEC fuel procurement strategy is guided by the government of the United Arab Emirates‚Äô support for international non- proliferation efforts, as outlined in the UAE Policy on Nuclear Energy, including the decision to forgo domestic enrichment and reprocessing of nuclear fuel. Human capacity development By 2020, ENEC expects to require more than 2,500 employees to operate its four nuclear energy plants, and the organization aims to fill 60 per cent of these roles with Emiratis. ENEC's ‚ÄòEnergy Pioneers‚Äô program is designed to recruit and train UAE nationals and provide them with an opportunity to join ENEC and contribute to the development of the country's first nuclear energy plants. The program plays an important role in developing the necessary local workforce to support the UAE's new nuclear energy industry. ENEC offers a range scholarship programs, training and career opportunities for graduates and professionals, including scholarships for bachelor's degrees in Chemical, Nuclear, Mechanical or Electrical Engineering delivered at universities in the UAE or USA; Master's degrees in Nuclear Engineering offered by Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi; and for the Higher Diploma of Nuclear Technology at the Abu Dhabi Polytechnic. The organization also offers technical training programs for Senior Reactor Operators (SROs) and a two-week intensive Summer Training Program in South Korea for high-achieving students from the Institute of Applied Technology. ENEC currently employs more than 1400 staff and sponsors almost 350 students under its Energy Pioneers scholarships program. Industrial development The establishment of a peaceful nuclear energy program in the UAE has brought with it the need to develop a specialized supply chain and skilled local workforce to service the country's new high-tech industry and help deliver ENEC's program. As a result, ENEC has established a dedicated Industrial Development team to assist UAE companies to raise their quality standards to international nuclear quality standards, in order to allow them to tender for ENEC's various contracts. As of April 2014, more than 1000 UAE companies have contributed to the ENEC program thus far, having successfully secured contracts totaling more than US $1.7 billion for a range of products and services to support the construction of the UAE's first nuclear energy plants. Contracts with local companies have been awarded through joint collaboration between ENEC and the Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), ENEC's Prime Contractor.

They are retractable and fluorescent green, usually with a band of white or yellow around the margin of the oral disc. The polyps are large, compared with related species, and may reach in diameter. Distribution Clavularia viridis is native to the tropical Indo-Pacific. It occurs at depths down to about and usually colonises other species of coral. Biology The tissues of this octocoral contain symbiotic unicellular protists known as zooxanthellae. These use photosynthesis to synthesize carbohydrates and the octocoral gets much of its nutrition from this source. It also spreads its tentacles to catch zooplankton floating past, and can extract organic matter from the sea water. Reproduction takes place in November when all the colonies in the area liberate gametes into the sea between 22 and 24 days after the full moon. Secondary metabolites A number of secondary metabolites have been isolated from this octocoral and two norcarotenoids showing cell growth-inhibitory activity were isolated from its symbiotic zooxanthellae.

He is one of the most widely recognized personalities to emerge from the NYC ballroom scene of the 1980s. He is best known for his work with Madonna. Early life Jos√© Guti√©rrez was born and raised in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, his parents having emigrated from the Dominican Republic. During his youth the neighborhood was a hotbed of raw creative energy, giving rise to the new wave music scene, the emergence of DJ culture, the development of the graffiti / street art movement, and the growing popularity of drag culture and entertainment. This creative environment would influence the way Jose perceived the world around him and the opportunities it presented for his own creative energy. As a child he was recognized for his natural dance ability and enrolled in a program of formal dance education, sponsored through the New York City Department of Education. He would continue his study of ballet and other dance styles throughout his teenage years, going on to attend the prestigious NYC Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts and studying under master choreographer Eliot Feld.  Voguing and ballroom scene  While in high school, Jose began to socialize among the Latino and African American LGBTQ community that regularly gathered along the West Side waterfront of New York City's West Village area, commonly known as \\"the piers\\". It was there that he first became aware of the gestural vocabulary and projected attitude of voguing. The dance style first emerged as part of the NYC underground ballroom scene, in which the dancers transition through a series of poses that emulate those of fashion models. Much like break dancing (which developed concurrently), there is an inherent competitive aspect to voguing in which the dancers try to outdo one another through increasingly complex poses and the fluidity of their transition between poses. The underground ball scene and voguing would later be popularized through the 1990 documentary Paris Is Burning, in which Jose appears voguing in competition. As a formally trained dancer, Jose became fascinated with the expressive and gestural dance style, quickly picking up the moves and integrating them with the more formal positions of ballet. As a teenager, Jose began attending and competing in balls hosted by the New York City \\"houses\\", where the best voguers gathered to battle on the runway for prizes and recognition. It was there that he came to the attention of mother Angie Xtravaganza, matriarch of the ballroom House of Xtravaganza and was invited to become a member of the group. Consistent with the tradition of ball culture, Jose took the house name as his adopted surname in 1986. Leveraging his formal dance training, Jose developed a unique style of voguing based on clean lines, precision poses, and effortless transitions, with a projection of disciplined elegance. This combination made Jose a respected opponent in ballroom competitions, garnering him numerous trophies and awards.Voguing and The House Ballroom Scene of New York City 1989-92. Soul Jazz Books, 2011. Public interest in the ballroom scene began to grow in the late 1980s, providing Jose the opportunity to showcase his talents to a broader audience. In 1988 he appeared in Details magazine, photographed by Timothy Greenfield-Sanders for an essay by Chi Chi Valenti about the House of Xtravaganza.Valenti, Chi Chi. \\"Nations\\". Details, October 1988, p. 159 - 174. He also appeared in the December 1988 issue of American Vogue magazine alongside Naomi Campbell and other models,\\"Economy Class\\". Vogue (U.S.), December 1988, pp. 368‚Äì371. the May 1989 issue of Time magazine, and other local and national publications. In 1989 he participated in the Love Ball, an elaborate celebrity fundraiser organized by the Design Industry Foundation for AIDS that used the basic structure of the original balls as a template for the evening's festivities.The Love Ball (program), Design Industry Foundation for AIDS, 1989. Love Ball participants included designers Carolina Herrera and Thierry Mugler; supermodel Iman; artists Keith Haring, Francesco Clemente, and Julian Schnabel; and performance artist Leigh Bowery, among others. Jose Xtravaganza took the Voguing competition grand prize trophy created by Keith Haring, likely the most valuable ball trophy ever created. That same year, Jose and other House of Xtravaganza members toured Japan, introducing voguing to an international audience. In collaboration with GMHC, Jose appeared in a safe sex public service announcement geared toward the ballroom community. In subsequent years, Jose and the House of Xtravaganza frequently lent their talents in support of organizations related to the LGBT community. In 1990 the ballroom scene and voguing began to enter the mainstream. Jennie Livingston's award-winning documentary film Paris Is Burning chronicled the underground scene and made celebrities some of the long-time stars of the ballroom scene, who to that point had remained mostly unknown to the larger public. Filmed between 1986 and 1989, the film captures a very young Jose Gutierez Xtravaganza voguing in competition, foreshadowing his transition to professional dancer the same year as the film's release.Livingston, Jennie.

It stars Helen Rogers, Alexandra Turshen, Lauren Molina, and Larry Fessenden. During a wild night of partying, three women realize that they have gotten into more trouble than they expected. Body premiered on January 25, 2015, at the Slamdance Film Festival. Plot Holly, Cali, and Mel become bored when they return home for the holidays. Cali convinces the others that they should go to her uncle's house, where they can party. In the house, however, Holly finds evidence that leads her to believe that Cali is unrelated to the owners. When she confronts Cali, Cali admits that they have broken into a house owned by a couple for whom she used to babysit. Holly and Mel insist that they leave, but before they can, Arthur, the groundskeeper surprises them. After a brief scuffle, Arthur falls down a staircase, apparently dead. The women panic and decide to cover up the accident. When Arthur turns out to not be dead after all, the friends disagree on how to proceed. Cast * Helen Rogers as Holly * Alexandra Turshen as Cali * Lauren Molina as Mel * Adam Cornelius as Ben * Larry Fessenden as Arthur Production The film was written to take advantage of the filmmakers' available resources. The conception was always a genre film, but the story went through many permutations before Berk and Olsen were satisfied. The role of Holly was written for Rogers, with whom the writer-directors had worked previously. Molina was recommended by one of the producers, and Turshen was cast after extensive auditions. Influences included Shallow Grave, The Shining, Funny Games, and Wolf Creek. Shooting took place during March 2014 in Westport, Connecticut. The characters represent Sigmund Freud's model of the id, ego, and superego. They were designed to show the various ways someone could react to the dilemmas in the film. Response Critical reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 42% based on 19 reviews, and an average rating of 6/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote that the film fails to rise above its unoriginal premise. Justin Lowe of The Hollywood Reporter described it as \\"an occasionally involving low-budget thriller that‚Äôs too often less than thrilling\\". Patrick Cooper of Bloody Disgusting rated it 3.5/5 stars and wrote, \\"Morbidly entertaining and emotionally honest, Body is one helluva debut for Dan Berk and Robert Olsen.\\" Jess Hicks, also writing for Bloody Disgusting, rated it 3/5 stars and wrote that too much time was given to character development that needed better writing. Kevin Jagernauth of IndieWire rated it B‚àí and wrote that the film \\"succeeds on its own very modest terms\\" due to its focus on characterization.

The festival is held every April using a variety of venues across the city as screening locations. Past venues have included: the Lansing Center, the Lansing Public Media Center, The Loft, Harem, The Exchange, Lansing Community College, the Michigan Historical Museum, and the Temple Building. History The Capital City Film Festival was founded in 2011 in the hopes of screening and encouraging local shorts and feature-length movies being made in and about Michigan. The scope broadened immediately due to the response from filmmakers and the festival now programs a wide variety of documentaries, narratives, experimental, and short films. The goal of promoting and giving screening space to Michigan-based films has expanded to include films from across the nation and the world. The festival emphasizes movies, music and technology. A full lineup of movies is shown across the Greater Lansing Region, alongside national bands and parties in the evenings. The signature events have included the Red Carpet Opening Night Party, Fortnight Film Contest, TEDxLansing, The MSU Media Sandbox, and free screenings throughout. Fortnight Film Contest In addition to the festival, the CCFF also hosts the Fortnight Film Contest. The Fortnight Film Contest is a two-week (one fortnight) film competition, where 20+ teams compete to create short films ranging from 31.4 seconds to 10 minutes, including credits. Teams are given three required elements to be included in their films, but unlike some film competitions, the required elements need not be the focus of the short. Their primary purpose is to ensure the film was made within the two- week period. Keeping with the festival's Michigan heritage, at least one of the major creative positions must be filled by a Michigan resident: Writer, Director, Cinematographer, or Editor. The short must also be shot and edited in Michigan.

She had founded that brand in 1994, and subsequently sold it to Est√©e Lauder Companies in 1999. Background Based in London, England, Jo Loves sells fragrances, scented candles, and bath and body products The name Jo Loves refers to the memories and experiences which inspired Malone to create each fragrance. When the brand launched in 2011, Malone said, \\"This new brand is about memories - it's where I am and the person I am now\\". The CEO is Gary Willcox, Malone's husband. Products The company produces 14 different fragrances, and bath cologne, body cr√®me, body lotion, bath & shower gel, and scented candles. The scent 'Pomelo' was the first fragrance that Malone created after a five-year pause from creating fragrances. Malone has explained that all of her products capture the things in life that inspire her, and many of the fragrances are influenced by Malone's interest in cooking. With Jo Loves, Malone has developed innovative products, including layered scented candles, launched in 2012. Composed of three scent layers, the candle burns through the first scent and then blends with the middle layer, producing a compound fragrance before burning down to the bottom layer for a final fragrance. Bath cologne was introduced in 2013; an industry first, it contains 10% fragrance, placing it between an eau de toilette and an eau de parfum. The formulation took Malone two years to develop. The same year Malone introduced the Jo Loves tapas, an in store service where customers are served fragrances as if they were culinary dishes, such as a tagine of Bath Cologne. Stores The first Jo Loves store was opened on 42 Elizabeth Street in London's Belgravia neighbourhood. The same site was the location of Malone's first job as a florist's assistant when she was sixteen years old. Malone created the fragrance \\"No. 42 The Flower Shop\\" to commemorate this. In November 2011, Jo Loves operated two pop-up stores; one in department store Selfridges in London and another in Mayfair, London. Jo Loves also has an on-line store.

Announced in 2014 and established in 2015, it is the first such program to launch in China. The highly selective program offers Yenching Scholarships, including tuition, accommodation, transportation, and a living stipend, to all students in the Academy. Yenching Scholars are selected annually from around the world through a competitive admission process. Unlike most graduate master's degrees in China that run two years for professional degrees and three years for academic degrees, the program lasts one year. There is also the option for Scholars to extend their studies for a second year, as well as the opportunity for Scholars to continue with doctoral studies at Peking. \\"Drawing inspiration from classical Chinese academy (Shuyuan) as well as the Rhodes Scholars' Program,\\" the Yenching Program at Peking University will compete with the Schwarzman Scholars Program (SSP) at Tsinghua University in China and similar global scholarship programs around the world. It is the first such program to launch in Asia. Studies The Yenching Program is an intensive global leadership program designed to provide outstanding young scholars with a broad interdisciplinary graduate education that reflects global perspectives. The Program will initially consist of concentrations in law and society, economics and management, public policy and international relations, literature and culture, history and archaeology, and philosophy and religion. The interdisciplinary nature of the Program is quite innovative in China, given the significant level of specialization into traditional fields in China. Courses at Yenching will be taught in English, however, those interested can take other courses at Peking in Chinese with more English courses expected as the university moves towards full bilingual (English and Chinese) education. It is possible that as the Program grows all courses offered by the university's graduate master's programs will be open to Yenching Scholars, as many of the Yenching courses are already offered in English through Peking's International Programs such as the MBA, MPA, MIR, and LLM in Chinese Law. Correspondingly, the elite liberal undergraduate Yuanpei Program at Yuanpei College offers similar opportunities for undergraduate students at Peking University. Residence During their studies, Yenching Scholars will live in Yenching Academy, a residential college of Peking University, built specifically for the Program and modeled on those at Harvard and MIT in the United States and Oxford and Cambridge in the United Kingdom. Located in Haidan district of Beijing city, the political, cultural, and academic capital of China, Scholars will experience one year of study and immersion including class work, field studies, internships, and travel.

'Amil was a professor of philosophy at the Lebanese University in Beirut, and a prominent member of both the Lebanese Communist Party and the Union of Lebanese Writers. He also contributed to the magazine al-Tariq, the mouthpiece of the Lebanese Communist Party.http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/7672/hassan-hamdan- mahdi-%60amel_a-profile-from-the-archi jadaliyyah.com 'Amil was assassinated at the age of 51, amidst the violence and chaos of the Lebanese civil war (1975-1990). Early life Mahdi was born in 1936 in Harouf, close to the southern Lebanese city of Nabatieh. His parents moved him and his siblings to Beirut shortly afterwards. In Beirut, Mahdi attended high school at the al- Maqasid School. In 1956, Mahdi began his university studies in France, eventually receiving a PhD in Philosophy from the University of Lyon. Afterwards, Mahdi began his active involvement with the Lebanese Communist Party, joining in 1960. Algeria In 1963, Mahdi moved to the newly independent Algeria with his wife, Evelyne Brun. Mahdi lived in Algeria for 13 years of his relatively short life (1963 to 1976). Return to Lebanon and the Communist Party Upon returning to Lebanon in 1976, Mahdi began work as a teacher at a high school for girls. Later on, he changed jobs to become a full-time professor at the Institute of Social Sciences at the Lebanese University. There, he taught philosophy, politics, and methodologies. At this time, Mahdi began contributing to al-Tariq, the mouthpiece of the Lebanese Communist Party. For the articles he wrote for this magazine, Mahdi began using the pseudonym by which he is now most commonly known (Mahdi 'Amel). Mahdi traveled widely within Lebanon to deliver lectures on Marxism and to discuss pressing issues with farmers around the country. Mahdi moved up the ranks of the Lebanese Communist Party, eventually becoming a member of the Central Committee in the Fifth Convention, which took place in 1987. Death Mahdi 'Amel was assassinated on May 18, 1987 at the age of 51. Amel was walking on Algeria street when two men called his name. As he turned around, the men shot him. He died later that day at the American University of Beirut's hospital. Works In 1991, a collection of his work from the period between 1968 and 1973 was published as In Issues of Teaching and Educational Policies. In this collection, Mahdi describes how Lebanon's education system reproduces sectarianism and undermines overall education.

The neighborhood is mainly composed of residential rowhouses, with a mixed-used business district along Edmondson Avenue, and industrial warehouses and buildings dotted along the CSX railroads that bound its western edge. Boundaries Baltimore City defines the neighborhood as bounded by North Bentalou St. to the west and North Monroe St. to the east, with north borders being the CSX train tracks, then West Lafayette Ave, and the south border formed by West Mulberry Street. Residents of Midtown-Edmondson would also include one or two blocks east of N. Monroe St toward N. Fulton St. The neighborhood includes zip codes 21217 and 21223. History Overview Residential development in Midtown Edmondson began as early as 1887 when local small builders constructed rowhouses and cottages with creative variations on the vernacular rowhome conventions of the period. These homes were initially designed as summer homes for city residents, but with the expansion of streetcar infrastructure down Edmondson Avenue in the 1890s, rowhouse development quickly became marketed to the city's growing middle class population. The mix of residential and industrial development reflects the uneven character of development in the years following the 1888 annexation of Baltimore County, as neighborhood groups in Midtown-Edmondson fought to secure investment for needed infrastructure and oppose the intrusion of commercial and industrial development, such as the Ward Baking Company in 1925, the Acme building and Interstate 170 (Maryland) highway construction in the 1970s. During the post-World War II period, the population of Midtown- Edmondson and nearby neighborhoods underwent a rapid transition from European American in the mid-1940s to become predominantly African American by the early-1950s. This transition offered many middle class African American households in Baltimore their first opportunity for buying a home and led to the creation of neighborhood organization that took an active role in local civil rights organizing and activism. While the physical development of the neighborhood was wholly complete by the beginning of World War II, the decades following 1945 saw significant changes. African Americans began moving west of Fulton Avenue in the mid-1940s and by the early 1950s the once segregated white neighborhood had become largely African American. From the 1960s through the present, the neighborhood experienced many of the same challenges affecting low-income African American neighborhoods across the city ‚Äì including persistent vacant housing and disinvestment from commercial corridors like Edmondson Avenue. Despite these issues, the residents have remained resilient undertaking organizing efforts to try to address a range of community concerns. 1880s-1940s Industrial and commercial development within the Midtown Edmondson area is concentrated along the railroad tracks and along the historic routes for the electric streetcars. In addition, the two major east-west through streets, Lafayette Avenue and Edmondson Avenue, offered more opportunities for continued commercial investment than the streets that terminate at the railroad tracks. With the expansion of the streetcar along Edmondson avenue, scores of rowhouses converted to commercial use early in the 1900s. Examples visible from the 1914 Sanborn maps include a wallpaper store, a paint store, a bakery, a hardware store, a drugstore, and a Chinese laundry. The Arrow Laundry at North Pulaski between Lafayette Avenue and Lanvale Street operated between 1914 and the early 1950s. As another example, the Pressman Brothers Grocery Store operated at 2237 Edmondson Avenue. One resident in this period, Jerry Leiber, later recalled his own experience growing up above his family's confectionery store at Riggs and McKean Avenues: \\"We were raised working in the store on the first floor and living in back of the store and on the second floor. We all worked in the store. When I was old enough to list, I started bagging potatoes and sorting out soda bottles by brands to turn them into the companies for cash. The neighborhood was full of Jewish-owned grocery stores. Spivak's was at Monroe and Lanvale Streets, Giller's at Mosher Street and Kirby Lane. By 1951, the rowhouses facing Edmondson Avenue between North Payson and Bentalou Streets had been entirely converted from residential to at least partially commercial use. Other commercial and industrial development required new construction. =American Ice Company= American Ice Company Constructed in 1911, the American Ice Company is an enduring reminder of West Baltimore‚Äôs industrial development. It is located at 2100 W. Franklin Street and the grounds contain a powerhouse that backs up to the CSX Railroad tracks. The Ice Company building was built during a time when West Baltimore was quickly developing beyond the 1816 city line as small builders put up new rowhouses that soon extended west out to the Gwynns Falls. The company was following the market trend toward \\"manufactured ice.\\" The previous decade had witnessed a shift in the ice industry from importing natural ice from rivers and lakes in the Northeast to direct competition with new factories that enabled businesses to supply a more regular and consistent supply of \\"manufactured ice.\\" In 2004, the building was severely damaged in a fire, and has not returned to operation since. The current owner has supported the building being part of Midtown- Edmondon's recent nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, and he plans to redevelop the property while retaining the historic ice house structure. =Ward Bakery= Built in 1925 over the loud protests of local residents who opposed a new factory in their residential neighborhood, the Ward Baking Company is a handsome brick box, designed by C.B. Comstock, a New York-based refrigeration architect and engineer. Based in Pittsburgh, the Ward Baking Company, then known as the Ward Bread Company, also had factories in the Bronx, Buffalo, and East Orange, New Jersey. Long retired as a factory, the building has more recently been used as a church. 1940s - 1960s  Racial transition in the Midtown Edmondson neighborhood took place in somewhat of a distinct pattern from the experiences of neighborhoods in Greater Rosemont and Edmondson Village located to the west of the railroad tracks. The transition occurred at an uneven pace during the late 1940s and early 1950s, evidently without the startling rapidity that was observed in other areas. This unusual character of change is likely the result of these blocks being immediately proximate to Fulton Avenue that had for nearly two decades defined West Baltimore's \\"color line.\\" During the 1910s and 1920s, racial transition in West Baltimore neighborhoods was occasionally accompanied by violence against black residents and white residents who rented or sold properties to black Baltimoreans. Around the beginning of World War II, the \\"color line\\" had stabilized around Fulton Avenue. Beginning in the late 1940s, however, neighborhoods at this edge began to transition from white to black. The change was driven by a number of factors including the rapid growth of Baltimore's African American population during the 1940s and 1950s, the intense overcrowding and deteriorating housing conditions within historically segregated African American neighborhoods, and the movement of white households out of the center city to the areas of new development in the Baltimore suburbs 1960s - 2000s The African American residents of Midtown Edmondson built a new identity for the neighborhood in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. New groups moved into the area like the Bandolero's Motorcycle Club that opened a clubhouse at 2025 Edmondson Avenue in 1967. Early members of the Club included Roland \\"Duck\\" Tyner. The Uptown Bar located at Monroe and Edmondson Avenue was a popular destination for many West Baltimore residents. James Ayers, grandson of Mrs. Viola Bernard who lived at 1815 Edmondson Avenue, was serving in Vietnam when he remarked to the Baltimore Afro-American, \\"I don't care for these Vietnam clubs. Nothing in Asia can compare to Baltimore's Uptown Bar.\\" For two weeks following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. on April 4, 1968, a series of civil disturbance devastated neighborhoods across the city of Baltimore, leaving six people dead, dozens injured and hundreds of properties, both private and public, burned and damaged. Riots began in Washington, DC and Detroit on April 5 and in Baltimore on April 6. By April 7, 1968, violence spread to Midtown Edmondson where stores were looted along Edmondson Avenue and Payson Street. By the morning of April 9, the Army began a citywide attempt to prevent further looting, reportedly including boarding up partially plundered stores and exploding a bomb of CS gas inside, starting on the 2000 block of Edmondson Avenue. By April 10, the disturbances began to end. Across the city, losses totaled $10 million. There were a reported 1,150 fires, 1,150 incidents of lootings, and nearly 5,000 arrests over the four days of unrest. Many of the corner stores and small businesses located in the area closed in the 1970s and 1980s but some long time institutions, like Green's Hardware, remained. Later additions included the former Super Pride Groceries location at the northeast corner of Lafayette and Edmondson Avenue. =Black Panthers ‚Äì 1971= In 1971, the Black Panthers organized a free clothes program at the 1800 block of Edmondson Avenue, part of a larger \\"survival project\\" organized by the party including a free medical clinic at the 500 block of Mosher Street and an expanded free breakfast program providing meals in the Lafayette Square area. =Super Pride Groceries ‚Äì 1970s= Charles Thurgood Burns (1915-1991) established Super Pride Groceries in 1970 when he took over the bankrupt Super Jet Market on East Chase Street. Renaming the business Super Pride, he rebuilt it despite the \\"refusal of some food companies to do business with a black- owned store.\\" Burns had started in the grocery business around 1921 delivering groceries for the small store his grandfather owned on Dolphin Street. He sold vegetables, produce and fish out of the back of a cart during high school and college then later became the co-owner of Hilton Court pharmacies - a chain of pharmacies \\"catered to the needs of black consumers at a time when white-owned businesses ignored them.\\" Between 1970 and 1990, Super Pride grew to seven locations, employing more than 400 people, and making over $43 million in annual sales. Under Burns' leadership, Super Pride sponsored Black History Month activities and supported the Arena Players. By the late 1990s, however, the business struggled to compete against national chains and the city's shrinking population. In the fall of 2000, Super Pride closed all eight of its locations and, in November, held an auction to liquidate the stores and their remaining equipment to satisfy creditors. =Edmondson Community Organization ‚Äì 1992= Neighborhood residents led an effort in the early 1990s to establish the Edmondson Community Organization. In June 1995, the U.S. Marshall's office and the U.S. Attorney for Maryland confiscated the Underground nightclub located at 2114 Edmondson Avenue and turned it over to the Edmondson Community Organization in an effort to push back against drug traffic in the area. The community organization took over the building under the leadership of president Charlotte M. Perry but limited funding made it difficult for the organization to expand its services to the community. The ECO Building continues to host meetings for Midtown Edmondson residents and other community organizations. In the past few years, neighborhood residents met at the ECO building between November 2006 and early January 2007 to form the West Baltimore Coalition and advocate for the development of the West Baltimore MARC Station Area. The coalition led to the organization of the West Baltimore MARC Transit-Oriented Development Transportation, Inc. (WBMTTI) that operated a farmer's market in the area for several years. =ROOTS Fest ‚Äì 2011= In 2011, several West Baltimore communities, including Midtown- Edmondson hosted the ROOTS Fest 2011: Many Communities, One Voice. This five- day event sought to empower and unite West Baltimore communities through the celebration of arts and culture. The festival, hosted over Interstate 170 (Maryland), which divides the community, kicked off with three-days of workshops on the intersection of art, culture, community organizing and empowerment, and was followed by a weekend of music, art, dancing, food and other free activities. It attracted thousands of people and nationally renowned artists and performers, such as go-go performer, Chuck Brown, and World Music/Spoken Word/Bluegrass rap duo Rising Appalachia. Demographics As of the 2010 census, there were 1,163 people living in the neighborhood. The racial makeup of Midtown-Edmondson was 97.6% African American, 1.1% White, 0.1% Native American, 0.1% Asian, 1.3% from other races, and 0.8% from two or more races.

The median household income was $23,819. About 32.2% of families and 30.8% of the population were below the poverty line. Historic District Nomination In 2014, parts of Midtown-Edmondson were included in the Edmondson Avenue Historic District. By 2015, the neighborhood was nominated for its own District. Public Transit Present- day MARC station with American Ice Company Building in Background Bus Midtown-Edmondson is serviced by three city buses: *15 Security Square/Westview to Overlea/White Marsh *23 Rolling Road/Wildwood to Fox Ridge *40 QuickBus Security Square Blvd. at CMS. to Middle River Train The neighborhood is also serviced by the West Baltimore (MARC station) for regional transit to Washington, DC. This station is along the Penn Line of the MARC train service route, providing service seven days a week. It also provides 660 free parking spaces, 335 of which were recently completed in the winter of 2014.

Oxnard Historic District. Oxnard was president of both the American Beet Sugar Company (which later changed its name to American Crystal Sugar Company) and the American Beet Sugar Association, which represents all the beet sugar factories in the United States. He and his brothers controlled five sugar factories in the United States. Background In 1860 Oxnard's French-born father sold his sugar cane plantations and refinery in Louisiana, and by doing so was able to escape the business risks of the American Civil War by returning to his native France where Henry was born in Marseilles the year before the Civil War started.http://snaccooperative.org/ark:/99166/w62j6x1v The family returned to the United States where Henry Oxnard would grow up in Massachusetts and attend Harvard College. In 1889, Oxnard and his associates established a sugar refinery in Grand Island, Nebraska. In 1891, two more plants were built in Chino, California and Norfolk, Nebraska. In 1900, Henry Oxnard married Marie Pichon with whom he had two daughters, Adeline (1901) who was named for her paternal grandmother, and Nadine (1903). Thoroughbred horse racing Henry Oxnard raced Thoroughbred horses under the nom de course Albemarle Stable. In 1902 he hired future Hall of Fame inductee R. Wyndham Walden to train his stable of horses. In 1903 Henry Oxnard purchased the 517 acre Blue Ridge Farm in Upperville, Virginia where he established a Thoroughbred breeding operation. In 2006, the farm was designated for its historical significance by the Virginia Landmarks Register and the National Register of Historic Places. Many involved in the horse racing industry were greatly harmed by the 1908 Hart‚ÄìAgnew Law which led to the closing of all racing in New York state in 1911 and 1912. A February 21, 1913 ruling by the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division saw horse racing return in 1913. Prior to the restart, in April Henry Oxnard and other wealthy industry leaders created the \\"Owners Fund\\" to cover losses for 1913 and 1914 incurred by those less fortunate who might need financial assistance while attempting to get back on their feet again. Death Henry Oxnard died on June 8, 1922 in New York City.

Box Unabomber (alternative title Praehidno) is a Bulgarian theatre play written by Zdrava Kamenova and Gergana Dimitrova. The play won \\"Ikar\\" award of the Union of Bulgarian Artists in 2012 for Best Bulgarian play of the year.official website of the Bulgarian Artists' Union  Themes  The authors bring several elements into focus in their work; mainly the notions of Ted Kaczynski and his manifesto. They focus heavily on Kaczynski's position that technology seems to be corrupting, rather than advancing the human race. Played as a parallel against the destructive progression of technology is the journey of the now extinct western long-beaked echidna and its attempt to find it a mate like itself to prevent disappearing forever. The strong thematic ties between the two; man thinking he can disappear despite always being watched by satellites, and the creature thinking it will never disappear, despite being the last of its kind, are deeply thought provoking.DC Metro Theatre Arts P.O. Box Unabomber is a play about the evolutionary dead-ends: humans‚Äô, animals‚Äô, nature's, society's. They are all around us and slowly die out and are being replaced. This is a play about the rapidly developing technologies, about self-satisfied scientists, about biological species on the edge of extinction, about a disintegrating family, about an environmental activist who tries to change the world but fails and remains just a common terrorist. There are several intertangled plotlines but all of them are united by the attempts of the characters to be heard in a world that grows increasingly alienated from the simple things. The characters have no faces, they are voices in the dark, they have no names, as if they are all lost in time and space without any chance of getting in touch with each other. The action takes place in all directions: * Inwards: a man suddenly disappears from his home and goes to the mountain alone, back to nature and back to his own substance. The police and his family are searching him. * Outwards: a female-animal leaves its forest and goes beyond, into the human world to look for a male. * Upwards: scientists are trying to build a cosmic elevator. * Downards: a satellite oversees everything and everybody on the Earth. The play is a question: Can the system be changed by means of violence? Why is the oldest surviving mammal threatened with extinction? Why do people want to go farther and farther? Where does all that lead to? P.O. Box Unabomber integrates quotations from Ted Kaczynski's (AKA \\"The Unabomber\\") manifesto Industrial Society and Its Future.
