Early life Wardell was born in England and educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated 1810, gained his LL.B. in 1817 and a LL.D. in 1823.Admissions to Trinity College, Cambridge, vol. IV, p. 68 Wardell was editor and proprietor of the Statesman, a London evening paper, when in 1819 he met William Wentworth. In 1823, Wardell applied for the new position of attorney-general in New South Wales but was unsuccessful; the position went instead to Saxe Bannister. Australia In 1824 Wardell sold his Statesman paper and formed a partnership with Wentworth. Printing materials were purchased as part of a plan to found an Australian newspaper, and they sailed for Australia, arriving about September. Soon afterwards they started The Australian, the first number appearing on 14 October 1824 and was to be published weekly at a cost of one shilling. It was the first independent paper to be published in Australia, and Governor Thomas Brisbane who was approaching the end of his term was inclined to welcome it. After the arrival of Governor Ralph Darling in December 1825, friction between the governor and the paper developed. Early in 1827 governor Darling was devising means to control its criticism of his actions; he brought in a newspaper tax of fourpence a copy, but chief justice Francis Forbes refused to sanction the act. In September 1827 Wardell who had referred to the governor in The Australian as \\"an ignorant and obstinate man\\" was charged with libel.http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/37072195/4249452 The Australian, 26 December 1827, Page 2 Wardell conducted his own defence with great ability and the jury failed to agree. Wardell was again on trial for libel in December, and Wentworth who was defending him asserted that the jurors, who were members of the military, might lose their commissions if they did not return a verdict for Darling. The jury again disagreed. Wardell was now editor and sole proprietor of The Australian and his practice as a barrister was increasing; early in 1831 the government was glad to brief him in an action for damages against it. Towards the end of 1831 Governor Darling was informed by Frederick John Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich that his six- year term as governor would soon be expiring, and after the arrival of Governor Richard Bourke, Wardell's writing became much more temperate in tone. In 1834, having made a moderate fortune, he was intending to go to England, but on 7 September 1834 when inspecting his estate on horseback at Petersham, New South Wales he came across three runaway convicts and tried to persuade them to give themselves up. The leader of the men, John Jenkins, however, picked up a gun and fatally shot Wardell. The men were arrested a few days later and two of them were subsequently hanged. Wardell was unmarried.

History From 7 September 1939, shortly after the outbreak of World War II, OB convoys sailed from Liverpool south through St George's Channel to the open Atlantic. Off Land's End the convoy would be joined by an OA convoy from London on the River Thames via the English Channel. The combined OA/OB convoys were escorted for about four days to get beyond the range of U-boat patrols before the ships dispersed to reach their individual destinations. After the fall of France in June 1940, OA and OB convoys sailed north to join in the Western Approaches. As German aircraft, submarines, and surface ships reached further into the Atlantic, ships formerly assigned to OA/OB convoys were formed into ON convoys sailing from Liverpool via the North Channel and escorted all the way to Halifax Harbour. These convoys were sequentially numbered from ON 1 sailing on 26 July 1941 to ON 305 sailing on 27 May 1945.Hague 2000 pp.157-160 From August 1942, the Mid-Ocean Escort Force of British and Canadian ships (with a few United States Coast Guard cutters) delivered ON convoys to the Royal Canadian Navy Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) off Halifax; and the WLEF escorted most convoys from ON 125 through ON 301 to New York City.Hague 2000 pp.158-160 Most ships in ON convoys were in ballast, although some carried coal or other export goods. A total of 14,864 ships sailed in 307 ON convoys. One ON convoy sailed in Fast and Slow sections and two others were cancelled. U-boats sank 81 of these ships, and another 23 were lost to marine accidents. These figures do not include stragglers; although the majority of casualties to U-boats were ships that had fallen out of convoys or were sailing independently. Ten warships on escort duty were also lost. Slow convoys Until April 1943, ships capable of speeds between were assigned to odd-numbered (fast) convoys‚Äîsometimes designated ON(F); while ships capable of speeds between were assigned to even-numbered (slow) convoys‚Äîsometimes designated ON(S) or (ambiguously) ONS. This situation, which has proved confusing to modern historians, prevailed until a new and separate series of ONS (Outbound North Slow) convoys was organised. These convoys were sequentially numbered from ONS 1 sailing on 4 April 1943 to ONS 51 sailing on 21 May 1945.Hague 2000 pp.163-164 ON 171 was a fast convoy, as were all subsequent ON convoys. The ONS series were suspended in the summer of 1944 as escort groups were diverted to cover the Normandy landings. A total of 1873 ships sailed in 51 ONS convoys. Only 5 of these were attacked (around 10%), though two of these battles were of major significance; ONS 5 is regarded as the turning point of the campaign, while ONS 18 was the last major convoy battle in the campaign. Nineteen ships were lost (around 1%) from ONS convoys. Notable battles around ON and ONS convoys The Outbound Northern convoys saw some of the major convoy battles of the Atlantic campaign; of the 40 convoys which lost 6 or more ships, 8 were in the ON series (of which 5 were Slow, and 3 were Fast) and one was in the ONS series. * Convoy ON 67 was one of the few North Atlantic trade convoy of early 1942 to be attacked by multiple U-boats.Blair (1996) p.510 * Convoy ON 92 * Convoy ON 122 was the first to illustrate the defensive value of HF/DF and type 271 centimeter- wavelength radar.Milner pp.148-150 * Convoy ON 127 was the only North Atlantic trade convoy of 1942 or 1943 where all U-boats deployed against the convoy launched torpedoes.Rohwer&Hummelchen; 1992 p.161 * Convoy ON 144 demonstrated the ability of s equipped with type 271 centimeter-wavelength radar.Blair (1998) pp.118-120 * Convoy ON 154 included the last Q-ship operation by the Royal Navy.Lenton&Colledge; 1968 p.279 Loss of 486 lives with 14 ships during the \\"Christmas Convoy\\" of December 1942 caused re-evaluation of Canadian convoy escorts.Milner 1985 pp.3-4 * Convoy ON 166.

Attacked in April‚ÄìMay 1943, ONS 5 saw the loss of 12 ships, and the destruction of 6 U-boats, in a week-long series of actions.

This forms part of the process of lithification. When a layer of sediment is originally deposited, it contains an open framework of particles with the pore space being usually filled with water. As more sediment is deposited above the layer, the effect of the increased loading is to increase the particle-to- particle stresses resulting in porosity reduction primarily through a more efficient packing of the particles and to a lesser extent through elastic compression and pressure solution. The initial porosity of a sediment depends on its lithology. Mudstones start with porosities of >60%, sandstones typically ~40% and carbonates sometimes as high as 70%. Results from hydrocarbon exploration wells show clear porosity reduction trends with depth.Sclater, J.G. & Christie, P.A.F. 1980. Continental stretching: an explanation of the post-mid-Cretaceous subsidence of the Central North Sea Basin. Journal of Geophysical Research, 85, 3711‚Äì3739. In sediments compacted under self-weight, especially in sedimentary basins, the porosity profiles often show an exponential decrease, called Athy's law as first shown by Athy in 1930. A mathematical analytical solution was obtained by Fowler and YangA. C. Fowler and X. S. Yang, Fast and slow compaction in sedimentary basins, SIAM Journal of Applied Mathematics, 59, 365-385 (1998.) to show the theoretical basis for Athy's law. This process can be easily observed in experiments and used as a good approximation to many real data.D. B. Bahr, E. W. Hutton, J. P. Syvitski, L. F. Pratson, Exponential approximations to compacted sediment porosity profiles, Computers & Geosciences, 27, 691-700 (2001). Differential compaction If there is a variation in thickness and compactability of a sequence, loading by later deposits will give rise to spatially varying amounts of compaction. This form of compaction is a function of the lithology of the base sediment. Both the thickness and structure of the later sequence will be controlled by the underlying geology in the absence of any active tectonics. Buried tilted fault blocks in a rift basin often produce large anticlinal closures in the post-rift section that may form traps for hydrocarbons e.g. the Daqing Field, the largest oil field in the People's Republic of China, in the Songliao Basin.http://energy.cr.usgs.gov/WEcont/regions/reg3/P3/tps/AU/au314412.pdf USGS report on the Songliao Basin References Category:Geological processes Category:Sedimentary rocks ","title":"Compaction (geology)"},{"id":"12763441","text":"Kavaklƒ±dere is a neighbourhood of √áankaya district in Ankara, capital of Turkey.

Sutherland at USAFFE Headquarters, Malinta Tunnel, 1 March 1942 Surrender of U.S. forces at the Malinta Tunnel on 6 May 1942 The Malinta Tunnel is a tunnel complex built by the United States Army Corps of Engineers on the island of Corregidor in the Philippines. It was initially used as a bomb-proof storage and personnel bunker, but was later equipped as a 1,000-bed hospital. The main tunnel, running east to west, is long, wide and high. Branching off from this main shaft are 13 lateral tunnels on the north side and 11 lateral tunnels on the south side. Each lateral averaged in length and in width. Name The Malinta Tunnel derives its name from Malinta Hill, a rise through which its shaft is bored. Malinta is Tagalog for \\"many leeches\\", linta being the local word for \\"leech\\". Construction Its construction, without benefit of new equipment or funds apportioned by the United States Congress due to agreements reached during the Washington Naval Conference, began in 1932 and the main tunnel and 25 laterals were completed in 1934. Other construction on laterals continued right up to the start of the war. The Army Corps of Engineers rented obsolete equipment from Baguio gold miners for a nominal fee and made do with condemned TNT from the Ordnance Department. The explosive delivered was in powder form, and had to be wrapped into makeshift cartridges using magazine pages, which were placed into holes drilled into the rock. Labor was provided by the Philippine Commonwealth in the form of 1,000 convicts from the Bilibid Prison in Manila. A company of engineers from the Philippine Scouts worked on the construction as foremen and clerks. The cement for concrete used to line the tunnels was bought from the Japanese. Battle of Corregidor During the Battle of Corregidor, the third lateral on the north side from the east entrance served as the headquarters of General Douglas MacArthur and the USAFFE. Malinta Tunnel also served as the seat of government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. At the vicinity of the tunnel's west entrance in the afternoon of 30 December 1941, Manuel L. Quezon and Sergio Osme√±a took their oaths of office as President and Vice-president of the Philippine Commonwealth in simple ceremonies attended by members of the garrison. Japanese troops forced the surrender of the remaining American and Filipino forces on 6 May 1942 while under the command of Lt. Gen. Jonathan Wainwright.Morton, Louis. \\"The Fall of Corregidor\\". Corregidor.org. Retrieved on 29 March 2012. Retaking of Corregidor During the re-taking of the island by U.S. forces in 1945, Japanese soldiers who had been trapped in the tunnel after the entrance was blocked as a result of gunfire from began committing suicide by detonating explosives within the tunnel complex the night of 23 February 1945. The collapsed laterals resulting from these explosions have never been excavated. Today Today, Malinta Tunnel is the venue of an audio-visual presentation by National Artist Lamberto V. Avellana of events that occurred during World War II, including the evacuation of President Quezon and General MacArthur by Motor Torpedo Boat Squadron Three from Corregidor to Mindanao. They were later flown to Australia. Quezon ran a government in exile in the United States during the war. A plaque in the Malinta Tunnel now marks a spot on the island of Corregidor.

Estimates of the number of victims range from 500,Ukrainian archives to 1,200.Pure Soldiers Or Sinister Legion Polish and Ukrainian historians disagree over the responsibility for the Huta Pienacka massacre. According to the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, the action was committed by the 14th subunit of the 14th SS Volunteer Division \\"Galizien\\" of the Waffen-SS.Investigation of the Crime Committed at the Village of Huta Pieniacka Polish witnesses testified that the orders were given by German officers. According to witness accounts and scholarly publications, SS Galizien were accompanied by a paramilitary unit of Ukrainian nationalists under W≈Çodzimierz Czerniawski's command, including members of the UPA and inhabitants of local villages who intended to seize property found in the households of the murdered. According to Ukrainian historians, the massacre was committed by SS Police regiments. The Warsaw division of the \\"Commission for the punishment of crimes against the Polish people\\" launched an investigation in July 2001. Background Huta Pieniacka was a village of about 1,000 ethnically Polish inhabitants in 200 houses, located in the Tarnopol Voivodeship, Poland (today Ternopil Oblast in Ukraine). In 1939, following joint German and Soviet attack on Poland, the voivodeship was annexed by the Soviet Union, becoming part of the Ukrainian Soviet Republic. After the 1941 German attack on the Soviet Union, it fell under German occupation. The village was a major Polish resistance centre, fighting against German forces and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army.Waffen SS ‚ÄúGalizien‚Äù (Halychyna) Division and Other Pro-Nazi Forces As a result, the Ukrainians wanted to eliminate this Polish stronghold. Polish inhabitants of the village co-operated with Soviet partisans, active in the area. In January and February 1944, Soviet troops were frequent visitors, and this was noticed by both the Ukrainians and the Germans.Ustalenia wynikajƒÖce ze ≈õledztwa w sprawie zbrodni ludob√≥jstwa funkcjonariuszy SS \\"GALIZIEN\\" i nacjonalist√≥w ukrai≈Ñskich na Polakach w Hucie Pieniackiej 28 lutego 1944 roku. An armed stronghold, Huta Pieniacka had fought off several attacks in 1943 and early 1944.Mieczyslaw Juchniewicz, \\"Polacy w. radzieckim ruchu podziemnym I partyzanckim 1941‚Äì1945.\\" Warsaw: Ministerstwo Obrony Narodowej.

Massacre Early in the morning of February 28, 1944, a mixed force of Ukrainian SS and German soldiers surrounded Huta Pieniacka. There were some 600‚Äì800 soldiers and it has been established that Kazimierz Wojciechowski (who was burnt alive that day), commandant of Polish forces in the village, had been informed of the approaching enemy around two hours before the attack. The Poles however, had too little time to prepare a defense or to escape. The village was shelled by artillery. Some time around noon a mixed force of Ukrainian SS and German soldiers and a strong contingent from the SS Freiwilligen Division \\"Galizien\\" surrounded Huta Pieniacka and herded the villagers into their barns.Piotrowski, p.230 The attackers set fire to the village and it burned all day. According to Bogus≈Çawa Marcinkowska, a historian from Krak√≥w's office of the Institute of National Remembrance, the Ukrainians threw infants against walls and cut open the stomachs of pregnant women. The murderers left at night. Many of them were drunk and singing songs. Only four houses remained, and on the next day a mass funeral took place. Those who survived escaped to Zloczow and other towns, never to return. Witnesses interrogated by the Polish prosecutors of \\"The Head Commission for the Prosecution of Crimes against the Polish Nation\\" described the details of crimes committed against women, children and newborn babies. After murdering the inhabitants of Huta Pieniacka, the local Ukrainian population looted the remaining property of the murdered, loading everything on horse-drawn carts that had been prepared beforehand. According to those Poles who survived, the Germans did not participate in the massacre itself. In the April 9, 2008 issue of the Gazeta Polska weekly, an article about the massacre appeared. According to those persons who survived (four of whom were cited), the murderers were Ukrainians of the SS Galizien Division. All those who recollected the massacre (Emilia Bernacka, then 10; Filomena Franczukowska, then 20; Jozefa Orlowska, then 16; and Regina Wroblewska, then 6) claimed that the village was attacked by the Ukrainian troops, who murdered all Poles they managed to catch, including infants. The mentioned persons survived because somebody managed to open the rear door of a village church in which the murderers were massacring the Polish civilians. Filomena Franczukowska, who was 20 then and is the oldest still-living survivor of the massacre (as of April 2008) stated in the Gazeta Polska article that the Ukrainians came to the village at 4 am. They entered Huta Pieniacka from the nearby village of Zarkow and began shooting at everybody. Her father had been beaten before being executed, and one of the attackers said loudly in Ukrainian: \\"Now you have your Poland and your England.\\" Franczukowska lost both parents and three younger siblings in the massacre; only her brother survived. She said that the murderers deliberately did not kill two twin boys, aged 4, and were laughing at the children who were trying to 'wake up' their dead mother. Franczukowska, together with her brother and a group of people, was ordered to go to a barn which was locked and set on fire. She somehow managed to open the rear door and escape to a forest. \\"Now they say they do not know who did it, but it is enough to visit neighboring Ukrainian villages, one can still see remnants of the stolen property. The locals remember this event and this is why none of them has settled in Huta Pieniacka since then,\\" she said.\\"Opowiesc o zamordowanej wiosce\\" (\\"Story of a murdered village\\"), April 9, 2008, Gazeta Polska The weekly publication of the Polish Home Army ‚Äì the Biuletyn Ziemi Czerwienskiej (Land of Czerwien Bulletin) for March 26, 1944 (‚Ññ 12) [216, p. 8] stated that during the Battle at Pidkamin and Brody, Soviet forces took a couple of hundred soldiers of the SS Galizien division prisoner. All were immediately shot in the Zbarazh castle on the basis that two weeks earlier they had apparently taken part in the killing of the Polish inhabitants of Huta Pienacka, and as a result could not be categorized as prisoners of war. Investigation The Warsaw branch of the Polish Institute of National Remembrance (IPN) started an investigation into the massacre in November 1992. The investigation was subsequently suspended between 1997 and 2001, and as of 2008 is being conducted by the Krak√≥w branch of the Institute. The Institute of History of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences investigated the events at Huta Pienicka and concluded that the 4th and 5th SS Police regiments did indeed kill the civilians within the village. It noted that at the time of the massacre the police regiments were not under 14th division command but rather under German police command (specifically, under German Sicherheitsdienst and SS command of the General Government). During this time, these units enjoyed a close relationship with local UPA units.Institute of Ukrainian History, Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army. Chapter 5. p. 284. Accessed 3 September 2009. 4 September 2009. Aftermath After the massacre, some local AK commanders forbade Polish strongholds from sheltering Soviet partisans in order to minimize the risk of those self-defence posts' destruction.Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists and the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, Chapter 5 . pp. 282‚Äì285. In the late 1940s, some 8,000 soldiers of the SS Galizien division were allowed to come to Britain, allegedly including members of the unit that massacred inhabitants of Huta Pieniacka. Most of them were not questioned about their activities, and successive British governments refused requests by lobby groups as well as American authorities to investigate their backgrounds. However, a 2001 television documentary, The SS in Britain, initiated a police investigation after uncovering evidence suggesting that former members of the SS Galizien division living in Britain had participated in massacres in Poland. The documentary, however, made numerous factual mistakes. The statement that the 4th and 5th regiments of the SS Galizien Division took part in the massacre was inaccurate, as the division had at that time been normalized to 3 regiments; there were no 4th or 5th regiments. The division also was at that time still in the process of formation, which was completed two months later in May 1944 near the Polish town of Dƒôbica. Recent events Table on monument One of the tables on monument with names of murdered Poles On February 28, 1989 a memorial was built on the site of the previous village, but was soon destroyed. A new monument commemorating the victims was erected in 2005 and unveiled on October 21, 2005. During the unveiling the consul put the blame of the massacre on the Ukrainians in his speech, stating, \\"On 28 February 1944, when the 'SS Galizien' together with other Ukrainian nationalists did horrible things as told by a contemporary, they shot mothers, children and murdered...\\" Ukraine sent a note of protest regarding the fact that the Polish consul had ignored the Ukrainian government completely when opening the monument, that the new monument did not adhere to \\"Ukrainian laws\\" and was erected without the \\"necessary permits\\". As a result of actions by the parliamentarian Oleh Tyahnybok, a note of protest regarding the \\"illegal erection\\" of the monument was sent out and the Polish consul was declared a persona non-grata for \\"degrading the national dignity of the Ukrainian people\\".–ü—Ä–æ –æ–≥–æ–ª–æ—à–µ–Ω–Ω—è –ø–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω–æ—é –Ω–æ–Ω-–≥—Ä–∞—Ç–∞ –∫–æ–Ω—Å—É–ª–∞ –†–µ—Å–ø—É–±–ª—ñ–∫–∏ –ü–æ–ª—å—â–∞ On February 28, 2007 a new monument was unveiled to the Poles who had been killed in the atrocities at Huta Peniacka.

The village of Huta Pieniacka no longer exists. Most of the houses were burned during the massacre and only the school and a Roman Catholic church remained. Both of these buildings were demolished after the war, and in the area of the village there is a pasture for cattle. There is a post with a Ukrainian inscription Center of the former village, but it does not mention the name of the village. January 2017: Monument to Polish WWII massacre victims desecrated with fascist symbols in Ukraine. A cross made of stone was blown up, while two tables with the names of the Poles killed in the 1944 massacre were damaged. The Polish Foreign Ministry has condemned the attack on the monument. In a statement published on its website, it called for an \\"immediate\\" investigation, saying those behind it must be punished. Incidents like this threaten relations between the two nations, the statement added. The monument was rebuilt on behalf of local Ukrainian community and unveiled on February 26, 2017.

The effects of brifentanil are very similar to those of alfentanil, with strong but short lasting analgesia and sedation, and particularly notable itching and respiratory depression. Side effects of fentanyl analogs are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression, which can be life-threatening. Fentanyl analogs have killed hundreds of people throughout Europe and the former Soviet republics since the most recent resurgence in use began in Estonia in the early 2000s, and novel derivatives continue to appear.

Symptoms include yellow to tan spots on the plant's leaves and stems. Initial disease symptoms will result in scattered sori (clustered sporangia), eventually covering the entirety of the leaf with coalescing pustulates. Both leaf surfaces, although more predominant on the underside (abaxial) of the leaf, will show yellow to brownish spore-producing these pustulate structures, and these are the signs of the disease. Spots on the upper leaf-surface coalesce and turn to brown-to-black as the disease progresses. Infection spots will become necrotic with time, with small holes (3 to 5mm) developing in older leaves. These infected leaves eventually become dry and prematurely fall. Control When canna rust first appears, the affected foliage should be removed and discarded, otherwise the fungi will propagate and destroy the whole plant. The affected foliage should not be composted, as that will simply spread the fungus further. Because canna rust thrives in warm, moist conditions (~20 ¬∞C), it is best to reduce irrigation or implement methods to reduce standing water, such as mulch and planting in the sun. Commercially, a liquid copper-based spray can be sprayed on the stems and both sides of the leaves to prevent fungal problems before they occur. Although used commercially, copper is not recommended for home use because of its heavy metal toxicity. Other practices include, reducing plant material or debris and reducing foliage from the plant. This practice can increase the aeration of the canopy, permitting more light and allowing fungicide sprays (if used) to reach the plant. This method disrupts the uredospores stage from persisting. Puccinia thaliae is a systemic pathogen, in that symptoms will affect a greater part or all of the plant. Disease cycle The disease cycle for canna rust has not been fully discovered, but there are several known pieces. Urediniospores (or uredospores), asexual rust spores, have been discovered on the leaf surface. The color of the urediniospore can range from a golden to a yellow-orange, and are egg or pear shaped. The uredospores are responsible for the spread of the rust to new leaf tissue. Uredospores are subglobose to ovoid or pyriform, echinulate, and measure 25.74 to 37.18 x 17.16 to 27.17 Œºm, with thickened walls apical walls (1.3 to 1.6 Œºm) and one to two equatorial germ pores. In addition, the overwintering spores that produce basidiospores, also known as teliospores, have been located on the leaf surface. The teliospores range from cylindrical, clavate to club shaped, with rounded apex and sized from 50‚àí83 √ó 14‚àí21 Œºm. Basidiospores are the sexual spores of rusts. There have been no pycnia or aecia located on Canna Rust. However, P. thaliae has been known to cause rust on several cannabis species and on arrowroot which are other uredial hosts. The pathogen is likely mobile in the plant leaf allowing it to spread across the leaf surface. The overwintering stage occurs during the wet and cold seasons. Environment The canna rust fungus grows best under high relative humidity and extended periods of leaf wetness (roughly ‚â•20 ¬∞C). This type of environment can be caused by high soil moisture, tall weeds surrounding the Canna, and dense shading that prevents moisture from evaporating from the leaf surface. The fungus can survive in most tropical environments where the canna lily grows due to the tropics high relative moisture throughout the growing season. P. thaliae has been reported throughout Europe and extends throughout the northern hemisphere. In North America, P. thaliae has been reported to cause rust in Canna indica in Florida and C. √ó generalis in Texas. Also reported throughout Hawaii since the 1970s. The host range of P. thaliae includes Canna indica (syn. C. edulis) and some hybrids of C. √ó generalis and other plants of the order Zingiberales. Moreover, P. thaliae on Canna lily was reported in South Africa. Importance Symptoms of the rust on canna leaves Canna is a very versatile plant that has both ornamental and agronomic uses. In tropical parts of the world Canna achira, the agricultural breed of Canna, is grown for starch production in its rhizomes and fiber production in the shoots. Countries like Ecuador and Peru used to rely on Canna as a staple crop. In Thailand Puccinia thaliae is listed as a medium threat to biosecurity and agriculture. The Canna rust damages the crop and can impact all of its potential uses by damaging photosynthetic material and reducing plant productivity and value. In the United States it is a popular ornamental for home gardens. The rust lowers the value of lilies for sale and can kill canna plants that home gardeners are trying to grow themselves.

The army was formed in February 1943. Until the aftermath of the Vilnius Offensive in July 1944, it was commanded by Pavel Rotmistrov. Its organisation varied throughout its history, but in general included two or more Guards Tank Corps and one or more Guards Mechanized Corps. It was considered an elite formation. Under Red Army doctrine of deep operations, Tank Armies were primarily to be used for large-scale exploitation of major offensives. Once a breach in enemy lines had been made by other units (typically Shock Armies or combined-arms armies), the tank army would be inserted into the gap to drive deep into enemy territory, attacking rear areas and seizing major communications centers to disrupt the enemy reactions. Tank armies were expected to penetrate up to several hundred kilometers into the enemy rear. After the war, the 5th Guards Tank Army moved to the Belorussian Military District. It was downsized to division size in late 1946 and became a mechanized army in 1948. The designation \\"5th Guards Tank Army\\" was restored in 1957. The army was taken over by the Belarus Ground Forces in June 1992 and became an army corps two months later. The 5th Guards Army Corps was disbanded in 2001. Its headquarters became the headquarters of the Belarus Ground Forces. World War II The 5th Guards Tank Army was formed on 25 February 1943 based on a Stavka order of 10 February 1943. It was part of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (Stavka Reserve). The army included the 3rd Guards and the 29th Tank Corps, the 5th Guards Mechanized Corps, the 994th Night Bomber Aviation Regiment, artillery and other smaller units. Battle of Kursk In 1943, it played a significant role in the Battle of Kursk, being one of the formations tasked with the counterattack at the Battle of Prokhorovka. Subordinated to the Steppe Front, at Kursk the Army controlled the 18th Tank Corps, 29th Tank Corps, 2nd Tank Corps, 5th Guards Mechanised Corps plus smaller units with a total of approximately 850 tanks.Combat composition of the Soviet Army, 1 August 1943. Early in 1944, it took part in the reduction of the Korsun-Cherkassy Pocket. Operation Bagration In June 1944, the 5th Guards Tank Army was used as the main exploitation force during the Soviet summer offensive, Operation Bagration. The formation was committed to an attack along and parallel to the main Moscow‚ÄìMinsk road, following initial breakthroughs by the rifle divisions of 11th Guards Army, and was instrumental in completing the encirclement and destruction of German forces at Minsk. It was then employed in the third phase of Operation Bagration. High casualties in this campaign, however, led to the unit's commander Lieutenant-General Pavel Rotmistrov being relieved of command and replaced with Vasily Volsky. Baltic Offensive Late in 1944, the 5th Guards Tank Army was committed against 3rd Panzer Army as part of the Baltic Offensive, pushing the German forces into a pocket at Memel. It was then moved south and took part in the East Prussian Operation as part of Konstantin Rokossovsky's 2nd Belorussian Front; driving to the coast at Elbing, it successfully cut off the Wehrmacht forces in East Prussia in what became known as the Heiligenbeil pocket. However, by March 1945, the 5th Guards Tank Army was being drawn down, with the subordinate 10th Tank Corps moved first to direct subordination of the 3rd Belorussian Front and then the STAVKA Reserve by 1 April 1945. This left the 5th Guards Tank Army with a single tank corps, the 29th, under its control.Soviet General Staff, Combat composition of the Soviet Army, March and April, 1945 This reduction in strength coincided with the hospitalization of the 5th GTA's commanding general, Vasily Volsky, for tuberculosis. Volsky did not return to the army (he died in February 1946) and Major General Maxim Sinenko [–°–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∫–æ –ú–∞–∫—Å–∏–º –î–µ–Ω–∏—Å–æ–≤–∏—á] took command from 16 March 1945 to the end of the war. After the war, Rotmistrov wrote a memoir and history of the unit, The Steel Guards. Cold War In July 1945, the army was relocated to Slutsk, part of the Baranovichi Military District. In February 1946, it moved to Bobruisk, after the Baranovichi and Minsk Military Districts had been combined into the Belorussian Military District. The army moved to Belarus with the 8th Guards and 29th Tank Divisions, and the 8th Mechanized Division, all formed from the corps of the same numbers after the end of the war. There, the 8th Mechanized Division was transferred and the newly created 15th Guards and 12th Mechanized Divisions joined the army. The army was briefly redesignated the 5th Guards Mechanized Army on 12 June 1946, and was reduced to the mobilization 5th Guards Mechanized Division (or 5th Separate Guards Tank Division (mobilization)) on 31 October 1946, with its divisions reduced to regiments. The unit was expanded into the 5th Guards Mechanized Army on 28 October 1948 as Cold War tensions increased. In the early 1950s, the 22nd Mechanized Division replaced the 15th Guards. By 1955 the army numbered 1,219 tanks and self-propelled guns, including 161 IS-4, 893 T-54, sixteen T-34/85, 75 PT-76, and 74 ISU-122, 24 ZSU-57 self-propelled anti- aircraft guns, and 705 guns. From then until the late 1980s the army's composition remained virtually unchanged ‚Äì only the mechanized divisions were redesignated in 1957. On 20 May of that year, the army was redesignated as the 5th Guards Tank Army. The 22nd Mechanized became the 36th Tank Division, then the 193rd in 1965, while the 12th Mechanized Division became the 5th Heavy Tank Division and was disbanded in 1960. On 21 February 1974, the army was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. In August 1979, the 84th Motor Rifle Division (a mobilization unit) was attached to the army at Marina Gorka after transferring from the 28th Army; it was disbanded in 1987. Until the late 1980s, the army included three tank divisions ‚Äì the 8th Guards at Marina Gorka, the 29th at Slutsk, and the 193rd at Bobruisk-25. Support units included the 302nd Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade at Marina Gorka, the 460th Rocket (formed 1988) and 306th Gun Artillery Brigades at Osipovichi, and the 56th Anti-Aircraft Rocket Brigade at Slutsk. In 1990, as the Cold War drew to a close, the 8th Guards and 29th Tank Divisions were reduced to storage bases. To replace the 8th Guards, the 30th Guards Motor Rifle Division, withdrawn from the Central Group of Forces in Czechoslovakia, joined the army. By November of that year, according to CFE Treaty data, the army fielded 238 T-72 tanks, 381 infantry fighting vehicles, and 228 guns, mortars, and MLRS. Belorussian Army In June 1992 the army was taken over by Belarus after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and on 12 August 1992 renamed 5th Guards Army Corps. The 5th Guards Army Corps was still active in September 2001, when the Belarus Minister of Defence, General Lieutenant Leonid Maltsev, congratulated the remaining Belarus Guards units on 60 years of existence. However, later in 2001, the headquarters of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Belarus was established on its basis.'Commander outlines reform of Belarusian Ground Forces,' Zvyazda, Minsk, in Belarusian, 2 October 2002, p.2, via Lexis-Nexis.

He was one of the Melbourne poets, and had a long tenure as poetry editor of The Age. Life Simpson was born in Melbourne. He studied at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and studied art under George Bell. He taught at schools in England and Australia. In 1968 he was appointed lecturer in art at Melbourne's Chisholm Institute of Technology. He retired in 1987, and died in 2002. Writing career Simpson was one of a group of Melbourne poets, including Chris Wallace-Crabbe, Vincent Buckley, Noel Macainsh, and Alexander Craig, who came together in the 1960s and 1970s.Gorton (2007) p. 14 Gorton writes that this was \\"a combative time in Australian poetry\\" with different \\"cliques\\" operating, including the Jindyworobaks, the New Poets and the Melbourne poets. The Melbourne poets were \\"deliberately prosaic ... finding their poetry in suburbs and ordinary days\\". Poet Chris Wallace-Crabbe reiterated this in his obituary of Simpson in The Age on 10 October 2002. He wrote that Simpson \\"was a poet who put the Australian suburbs on the map. Verse had long been under the thumb of the landed gentry and Sydney quasi-bohemians, but he stuck resolutely, quietly, diurnally to the way most of us live\\".Cited in AusLit News (2002) Gorton qualifies this, though, by writing that Simpson's poetry's strength is that it is \\"at once so commonplace and odd\\", providing an artist's \\"skewed perspective on familiar happenings\\".Gorton (2007) p. 15 Gorton suggests too, that his poetry is extroverted rather than inward-looking, that it can be \\"comic and lugubrious, ponderous and terse\\", and that he can turn his analysis on himself.Gorton (2007) p. 16 His first book of poetry Walk along the beach was published in 1960, and was followed by another 10 volumes over the next four decades. His last work was published posthumously. He and Chris Wallace-Crabbe both used the pseudonym \\"Gillian Bianchini\\".AusLit (2007) Simpson was poetry editor of The Bulletin (1963‚Äì65), following Vincent Buckley, and of The Age (1969‚Äì97). He received the Christopher Brennan Award from the Fellowship of Australian Writers in 1992. Art career Simpson was an artist as well as a poet, and often illustrated his poetry drafts. His published poetry collection, The Midday Clock (1999), includes his own pen and ink drawings, the role of which he told the publisher was to help illustrate the message of his poetry.

Its approach road starts from the Harihara street that connects the bus stand and temple. The approach road was converted to concrete, making it more easily accessible even in monsoon season. The village is on the banks of Tunga river, on the opposite side of Narasimha Vana that houses Sringeri Sharada Peetham.  Temples  The Chaturmurti Vidyeshwara temple is located in a hamlet called Simhagiri, off the approach road to Vidyaranyapura. As the name suggests, it combines four murties (idols). The front idol is that of Sri Vidyatirtha, flanked by his two chief disciples Sri Bharati Tirtha and Sri Vidyaranya. The other three idols are of Brahma, Vishnu and Maheshwara (Shiva). These are topped by Sri Lakshmi Narasimha, which in turn is topped by a Shiva Linga. The agrahara has few small temples next to the main road, dedicated to Sri Rama, Sri Kalikamba, Sri Adi Shankaracharya and Sri Vidyaranya, after who the village is named.

The hamlet is located on the east bank of the River Lune, and is one and a half miles south west of the Lancaster city centre. The name can be split into two parts, ald which roughly means 'old', and clif which means 'high ground'. There are also a number of different variations over the centuries: Aldeclif (1086), Audecliva (1094), Audeclyviam (1190), Aldeclive (1212), Aidedyf (1341), Auclyff (1577), Awcliffe (1577), Adclife, Aldcliffe, Alclife, Aldclif, Aldclife, Aldclyffe, Altlife, Auldcliffe, Auckliff, Aucliff, Aucliffe and Aukliffe. The first part of the name may also be the Brittonic alt meaning \\"a steep height or hill, a cliff\\". The traditional pronunciation is \\"Awcliffe\\" while \\"A 1 d cliff e\\" may have been the ancient and the newcomer's pronunciation. History 'Aldeclif' is recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086 as being a \\"vill\\" of the Manor of Halton held by Tostig Godwinson pre-conquest. After the Norman conquest, Roger the Poitevin received the Manor of Halton then moved the manorial headquarters to Lancaster, the site of the Roman fort of Castle Hill. The Aldclife Old Hall was built some time between 1087 and 1094. In 1094 via the Foundation Charter of the Priory of St. Mary of Lancaster, Roger gave the Benedictine Abbey of St. Martin in the town of Sees, Normandy land to start the new religious house including the manor of Aldcliffe and its manor hall. The priory was also grant the right to a tithe, in cash or in kind, from the landholders in Aldcliffe. The foundation charter was confirmed by the Pope in 1133 and 1143. Gilbert fitz Roger fitz Reinfried had some interest similar to the Lord of the Manor for village between 1149 and 1188. Gilbert had a causeway build on Aldeciffe land adjacent to the Stodday mill pond for which he paid the priory \\"one pound of pepper at the feast of St. Michael annually\\" and tithes from the mill and of the fish in the pond. With the beginning of the Hundred Years' War in 1337 under King Edward III, the priory tithe stopped going to the St. Martin Abbey being seized by the King and transferred to the Bridgettine House. The Manor of Aldcliffe including the services of the free tenants, bondmen and tenants-at-will was leased in 1360 to John de Ipre, or of Ypres, for 60 years for 20 pounds per year. The next year John was appointed High Sheriff of Lancashire for life by the Duke. The manor was leased to Peter De Bolron in 1384 by Prior John Innocent for 60 years at 10 pounds per year. The Bridgettine House began holding its local court at Aldcliffe. Aldclife Old Hall was enlarged in the late 15th century. William Tunstall leased Aldcliffe and Lonsdale from the Abbess in 1522 at 100 rent, but was this lease was upended by the seizure of church land by King Henry VIII. In early years, Lancaster was becoming a difficult place to be Catholic, and Aldcliffe Hall became a place of Catholic worship. The civil parish of Aldcliffe was created in 1866 within Lancaster Rural District and was abolished and incorporated into Lancaster civil parish in 1935. The population was recorded as 68 in 1871, 106 in 1891, and 69 in 1931. The parish was bordered on the south by the parish of Ashton with Stodday. The Priory Charter Tithe was bought out in 1970. In the 1970s, Oaklands Courts and Craigland Court were built on the site of the first hall.

He probably was bipolar, becoming unstable after the loss of his fortune in 1688. Life=Early life Coenraad was baptised at home because his father Dirk van Beuningen and mother Catharina Burgh were Remonstrants and did not want to cause a fuss. He was the grandson of Geurt van Beuningen as well as of Albert C. Burgh, both mayors of Amsterdam and heavily involved in the Dutch East India Company. Coenraad grew up near the Sint Antoniesbreestraat in a very multi-religious and multi-ethnic neighbourhood, next to Pieter Lastman. He was taught at the Latin school of Gerhard Johann Vossius and Barlaeus, before commencing studies at the University of Leiden in 1639. In 1642, Hugo de Groot, Swedish envoy in Paris, made Coenraad his secretary and in 1643 Coenraad became town clerk in Amsterdam, although he did not feel himself capable. Sweden About 1650, Van Beuningen felt himself attracted to Spinoza and the Collegiants in Rijnsburg. He lived as simply as possible, without a job, somewhere within the area. In 1652, he was sent on a mission to Queen Christina of Sweden, who was being taught Greek by his schoolfriend Isaac Vossius. In 1654 he travelled to Stade to negotiate an end to an argument about the entry point to the Oresund. The north of Germany was occupied by the Swedes. The Danes tried to control the Elbe, the trade to Hamburg and occupied Bremen. Van Beuningen pronounced that the keys of Oresund lay in a dock in Amsterdam. Three years later as an envoy in Copenhagen, he almost ended up in the hands of King Charles X Gustav of Sweden but succeeded in getting away in a small boat. Ambassador In 1660, he was sent on missions to France and England. Louis XIV of France offered him a post in France that he refused. Van Beuningen warned against the imperialist and mercantilist French policy and wanted to move to Constantinople. He was impressed by Jan Swammerdam, who was travelling in France to study, and remained his firm supporter for the rest of his life. In the same year, 1664, a treaty with France was followed by the Second Anglo-Dutch War and the Triple Alliance. In 1669, he bought a plot in a backstreet and built a house (Blijenburg) in 's-Gravenhage and embellished it with paintings and Turkish rugs. Van Beuningen agreed to the ban on French silk and to actions against French brandy and salt. In that year he became mayor of Amsterdam. In 1672, he was nominated as the successor to Johan de Witt, not being a hard core republican. Losing the favour of stadholder William III an attempt was made on his life; it is said he was shocked and burnt part of his furniture. In one of his letters he wrote of the fantastic expansion of trade and imperialism in India and America. He also noticed that the Dutch Republic had had for 150 years more soldiers than all the other Christian countries put together. Later years Van Beuningen became more interested in literature, philosophy, theology, history and the natural sciences. He wrote deeply on the consequences of the tropical winds and currents, discussing them with Isaac Vossius. He was on friendly terms with Jan Six and Anna Maria van Schurman. Van Beuningen was interested in the ideas of Descartes and combined this with an interest for mysticism, astrology, Millennialism dream-interpretation and supernatural wonders. He sympathised with Jean de Labadie and the Quakers. In 1672 the Rampjaar, the local theatre, called Schouwburg of Van Campen, was shut during the war with the French, the English and two German bishops, Bernhard von Galen from M√ºnster and Maximilian Henry of Bavaria from Cologne. In 1677 it reopened, after a determined campaign led by Van Beuningen and Joan Hudde, on condition nothing was staged which could be deemed harmful either to public morals or the public church. In 1682, he funded the publication of the work of the mystic Jacob B√∂hme. In 1686, Van Beuningen married his neighbour, the rich and lewd Jacoba Victoria Bartolotti, many years his junior. Van Beuningen demanded economies by the Dutch East India Company (VOC), proposing measures to introduce more efficient administration and demanding more supervision and sharper observance of the Company's rules in Asia. Conditions were peaceful and so convoys and the maintenance of the VOC's forts were now deemed less necessary. Attacked in his various roles for making these suggestions, he renounced them, but claimed the company's success was the work of its capable administrators in its first twenty years. Van Beuningen lost half a million guilder in 1688 through speculation in VOC shares. The funding of the armed invasion of William III in England caused a financial crisis in the Dutch Republic. Following Van Beuningen's resultant madness the city of Amsterdam was appointed his legal guardian. Quickly he was put under custodial care by his colleagues, one of whom was Johannes Hudde. His house in the Hague was taken over in 1690 by the VOC. In his last years Van Beuningen wrote letters to the ecclesiastical authorities about the coming apocalypse, painting Hebrew or Kabbalistic signs on his house at the Amstel. He was locked up nearby and died in poverty on 26 October 1693, leaving 'a cape and two dressing gowns,' a bed, some chairs, a desk, an oval shaped mirror, four old taborets and 'a man's portrait' by Rembrandt valued at seven guilders (three dollars).

Parish church  Church of St Giles There was a church at Alderton in the 12th century, later dedicated to St Giles. In 1844‚Äì5 it was rebuilt by James Thomson at the expense of Joseph Neeld, who bought Alderton manor in 1927. Re-used elements from the earlier building include the north doorway and the three-bay arcade, both of c. 1200; and from the 15th century, the nave roof and the rood screen. Some masonry from the old church was re-used in the building of the nearby school, also at Neeld's expense. Thomson worked on other churches in the area, including St Margaret's, Leigh Delamere. There are monuments to the Gore family, including Thomas Gore (1632‚Äì1684), a High Sheriff of Wiltshire and writer on heraldry.

He was born into a priest‚Äôs family near Dusheti, and enrolled in the Tbilisi Theological Seminary in 1883. In 1887, he was excluded from the seminary for his rebellious ideas, but restored again in 1889. From 1890 to 1895 he studied at the Warsaw veterinary college, where he engaged in a student underground society. He was arrested by the Imperial Russian police for having formed the League for Georgia‚Äôs Freedom in Warsaw. He then worked as a veterinary inspector in the Tbilisi slaughterhouse, until he was sacked as a \\"whistle-blower\\" in a scandal about contaminated pork. Aragvispireli brought his personal working experience into a series of short stories from 1895 and quickly won popularity. One of his best stories, It's Earth (·Éõ·Éò·É¨·Éê·Éê) appeared in 1901. It was a story of a consumptive Georgian convict exiled to Siberia and killed there for refusing to throw away a bag of Georgian earth he has kept for his grave. Aragvispireli married contemporary European influences, particularly Maupassant and Przybyszewski to native traditions of idealization of the primitive typical to the Georgian mountaineer writers such as Alexander Kazbegi. In his drama Shio the Prince (·É®·Éò·Éù ·Éó·Éê·Éï·Éê·Éì·Éò, 1905), he took a Symbolist view of Georgian history, but it failed. His most successful work, the novel A Fractured Heart (·Éí·Éê·Éë·Éñ·Éê·É†·É£·Éö·Éò ·Éí·É£·Éö·Éò, 1920), was a sentimental fairy-tale of the love of a princess and a goldsmith. It even earned appraisal from the Soviet critics who had frequently attacked Aragvispireli‚Äôs gruesome Expressionism.

Louis-√âtienne Fran√ßois H√©ricart-Ferrand, vicomte de Thury, (Paris, 3 June 1776 ‚Äì Rome, 15 January 1854) was a French politician and man of science. He was a mining engineer who produced more than 350 scholarly articles; was a member of numerous societies and professional associations. He was heir to an estate of great horticultural richness with the equivalent of a private arboretum. He was a founding member of the National Horticultural Society of France. His family were of the noblesse de robe, his father a master councillor at the Cour des Comptes. The younger H√©ricart showed an aptitude for science and was enrolled in the √âcole des Mines 13 April 1795. His first commissions sent him on several trips to the south of France. In 1809 he was assigned the position of general inspector of quarries, a position he held, under changes of government, until 1830. Following the work of Charles Axel Guillaumot, he undertook the work researching and consolidating former Paris' subterranean mines. In 1814 he was received a member of the Soci√©t√© royale et centrale d'agriculture, first of a long list of scientific societies in which he was a member or correspondent. He was named director of the B√¢timents civils of Paris in 1823, and in that capacity oversaw the construction of the Paris Bourse, the completion of the Arc de Triomphe and the transformation of the H√¥tel de Cluny into a museum. He was elected a member of the Acad√©mie des sciences in 1824. He was listed among the four hundred founding members of the Soci√©t√© d'horticulture de Paris, 11 June 1827.

In 1945, he married Jean Nesbit Warne, the daughter of J. L. Warne. They had one son and one daughter. Sloane participated in various sports and represented various areas in rugby and cricket. He served with the New Zealand Engineers from 1940 to 1945. Sloane was the director of the Northern Wairoa Dairy Company (1955‚Äì1960). He was active with the Royal New Zealand Returned and Services' Association (RSA) and was president of a local district for three years. As vice-president of the Northland district, he served on the dominion executive. He represented the seat of Hobson in Northland from to 1966, and from to 1975, when he retired. In 1961, he was one of ten national members of Parliament to vote with the Opposition and remove capital punishment for murder from the Crimes Bill that the Second National Government had introduced. In the 1966 election, Vernon Cracknell, an accountant, who had come second in the previous two elections narrowly defeated Sloane, the incumbent (again, Labour was third). Cracknell was the first representative in Parliament of the Social Credit Party. However, as Cracknell did not prove a good performer in Parliament, and Social Credit ran a poor 1969 campaign, Sloane regained his seat with a substantial margin after three years and Social Credit lost its only MP.

It is situated approximately two-and-a-half miles south-west of Abbeytown, one-and-a-quarter miles south of Highlaws, and two-and-a-quarter miles north-east of the hamlet of Holme St. Cuthbert. Other nearby settlements include Pelutho, a mile-and-a-half to the north-west, Mawbray, four miles to the south-west, and Westnewton, three-and-three-quarter miles to the south. Cumbria's county town, Carlisle, is located twenty-and-a-half miles to the north-east. History and etymology Aldoth's name comes from the Old English eald hlada, meaning \\"old barn\\". In the past, variant spellings have included Ialdlathyt, Aldath, Aldeth, and Aldelathe. Aldoth was mentioned in a survey conducted in the year 1538, during the reign of Henry VIII. Then known as Aldeth, the survey recorded that there were at least ten families living in the community. In 1851, a school was built in Aldoth, paid for by the National Organisation for Education of the Poor. There were as many as 55 pupils enrolled in the school at its height, though numbers were known to drop rather dramatically around harvest time and during bad weather. School inspectors noted several issues with the school, such as the lack of nearby accommodation for a teacher, insufficient space for the number of pupils, and animals \\"which invade the cloak-rooms and attack the food stored for midday use\\". Despite eventually being connected to water mains, the school continued to make use of earth toilets. There was a high turnover of teachers in the early 20th century, but by 1929 the school had more stability when Mr Carr arrived. He remained the teacher until Aldoth school closed in 1957. Aldoth show An agricultural show took place at Aldoth until at least the 1960s. It was an annual event, usually taking place in August, and would attract visitors from all over the local area. Prizes were awarded for livestock, vegetables, baking, knitting, jam-making, and handicrafts, and the local pub erected a beer tent for the duration of the show. Hound trailing took place, as did harness racing and sulky trotting, and bets were often placed on the outcome of these events. The grand finale would involve a parade of award-winning livestock. In the evening after the show, a dance was often held in Aldoth school. Poem A poem in Cumbrian dialect was composed in honour of Aldoth show, sometime around the year 1911. Than here's success't Aldoth show, Ta't offocials good health, We'll wish them free fra ivvery cus An blest wid ivvery wealth, May old dame fortune hover round An smile upon them o' An that weather chap just lift his cup, Ta favour Aldoth Show. -Unknown, 1911 References Category:Hamlets in Cumbria Category:Allerdale ","title":"Aldoth"},{"id":"12763874","text":"Francisco Javier S√°nchez Broto (born 25 August 1971) is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a goalkeeper. After eight years in his country where he appeared almost exclusively as a backup, playing for four clubs, he headed to Scotland, where he represented Airdrieonians, Livingston and Celtic. Club career Born in Barcelona, Catalonia, S√°nchez Broto joined the Real Zaragoza academy at 14, where his failure to make an impression as a forward led to his being used as a goalkeeper. In the 1992‚Äì93 edition of La Liga, he appeared in four games for the Aragonese's first team, and subsequently moved to the second division, playing for Villarreal CF and M√°laga CF and winning a championship medal with the latter (he only played four league matches over two seasons, however). In 2000, S√°nchez Broto moved to Scottish club Airdrie on a Bosman transfer. During his first year, his team won the Scottish Challenge Cup after the player saved three penalties in the shootout against Livingston. When they ran into financial problems he joined Livingston in March 2001, being an important member of the Scottish First Division-winning side in 2001, while earning himself the SPFA Player of the Season Award. In January 2003, S√°nchez Broto joined Celtic, who required a goalkeeper following injuries to Rab Douglas and Magnus Hedman. Broto was cup-tied for Celtic's run to the 2003 UEFA Cup Final. He left the club at the end of the campaign, citing a desire to return home, and signed with Real Murcia in the top division for the following season, appearing rarely in an eventual relegation. S√°nchez Broto signed with newly promoted Getafe CF ‚Äì the club's first ever appearance in the top flight ‚Äì in 2004‚Äì05. Not an undisputed starter for the Madrid side, he did appear in 20 league matches out of 38, his performances resulting in Marca rating him the third-best goalkeeper in Spain for that season; during his tenure, after losing a bet, he donated a pair of goalkeeper gloves to every goalkeeper in Spain's lower divisions. After one sole season, 34-year-old S√°nchez Broto signed with H√©rcules CF in the second level, but retired from professional football shortly after due to injuries. He expressed regret at having to retire so young, and despite his popularity throughout his career, remained self-effacing when looking back.

He was the first Spanish player to be awarded the title of grandmaster (GM), and was a seven-time national champion.. ajedrez.pastranec.netLeontxo Garc·ªâa,Muere Arturo Pomar - El legendario ajedrecista, heptacampe√≥n de Espa√±a, ten√≠a 84 a√±os El Pais, May 27, 2016  Biography =The prodigy Arturo Pomar (Baarn, 1947) Pomar was born in Palma de Mallorca and was known in his youth, as Arturito. Hailed as a chess prodigy, he was runner-up at the Championship of the Balearic Isles when he was 10 years old, and won the title the following year. World Champion Alexander Alekhine spent time in Spain and Portugal after World War II and took an interest in the young Pomar, even giving him a series of special chess lessons. A part of Alekhine's 1946 book ‚Äò‚ÄôLegado!‚Äô‚Äô was devoted to him. He played his first international tournament at Madrid in October 1943. Narrowly avoiding last place, he defeated Friedrich Saemisch, who was of grandmaster strength. Then, at just 13 years of age, he was able to draw a game against his esteemed teacher at a tournament in Gij√≥n (1944). The game itself was an exciting \\"back and forth\\" affair, with Pomar outplaying the World Champion in the endgame phase and reaching a theoretically won position. However, inexact play allowed Alekhine to draw, in a game that lasted over 70 moves. Alekhine won the event and Pomar finished fifth. His precocity invited comparison with previous prodigies like Paul Morphy, Jos√© Ra√∫l Capablanca and Sammy Reshevsky. In his home country, he became quite famous, appearing in radio interviews and on film., but as his career progressed, he never quite fulfilled the early promise. Spain's first grandmaster Pomar's best results in international competition probably occurred at the Madrid Zonal of 1960, where he shared first place with Svetozar Gligoriƒá, Jan Hein Donner and Lajos Portisch; at Torremolinos 1961 (first with Gligoric); Malaga 1964 (first, ahead of Portisch); Palma de Mallorca 1966 (second, after Mikhail Tal, ahead of Portisch); and at Malaga 1971 (first). His success in 1960 qualified him for a place at the Stockholm Interzonal tournament of 1962, where he finished 11th= (Fischer won). This was as close as he got to mounting a challenge for the world title. He was awarded the International Master title in 1950 and became Spain's first grandmaster in 1962. Pomar was Spanish champion seven times (1946, 1950, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1962, and 1966), and Sub-Champion four times (1951, 1956, 1964, and 1969), a record not surpassed until 2010, by Miguel Illescas. A prolific tournament player Close to the end of the war, he tied for fourth/fifth place at Madrid 1945 (Alekhine won); took fourth place at Gij√≥n 1945 (Antonio Rico won); and shared third place at Almer√≠a 1945 (F. L√≥pez N√∫√±ez and Alekhine won). There followed many international appearances. His further results included sixth place at London 1946 (Herman Steiner won) and victory in a short match against Jacques Mieses (1¬Ω‚Äì¬Ω, also held in London). He tied for 12‚Äì13th at Barcelona 1946 (Miguel Najdorf won); tied for 15‚Äì16th at Mar del Plata 1949 (H√©ctor Rossetto won); won at Santa Fe 1949; tied for second/third place, behind Paul Michel, at Rosario 1949; shared first at Paris 1949; tied for second/third at Gij√≥n 1950; took 15th at Madrid 1951 (Lodewijk Prins won); took 14th at Bad Pyrmont 1951 (zonal); took 2nd at Hollywood 1952; tied for first/second at New Orleans 1954 (US Open); won at Gij√≥n 1955;Torneo Cerrado Internacional .

A career setback Pomar suffered at least two nervous breakdowns while attending tournaments. At Marianske Lazne in 1965, he completed nine of his fifteen games to finish with a share of last place. At Dundee 1967, he withdrew with less than half of his games completed, and his score was cancelled.The Times, July 17, 1967 p. 3Di Felice, p. 375 Although he made a good recovery, his later play and results were affected by the experience. Times journalist Harry Golombek refers to an incident at Palma de Mallorca 1971, when Pomar was winning against Bent Larsen, but went astray and suffered the ignominy of being checkmated by an advancing pawn.The Times, December 18, 1971, p. 7 Later life In later life, he was many times a guest of honour, especially at the Chess Olympiad of Calvia, held in 2004 on his birth island.

Cornu aspersum (previously Helix aspersa) ‚Äì the common garden snail ‚Äì in Israel Colonies of snails in Sicily A land snail is any of the numerous species of snail that live on land, as opposed to the sea snails and freshwater snails. Land snail is the common name for terrestrial gastropod mollusks that have shells (those without shells are known as slugs). However, it is not always easy to say which species are terrestrial, because some are more or less amphibious between land and fresh water, and others are relatively amphibious between land and salt water. Land snails are a polyphyletic group comprising at least ten independent evolutionary transitions to terrestrial life (the last common ancestor of all gastropods was marine). The majority of land snails are pulmonates that have a lung and breathe air. Most of the non-pulmonate land snails belong to lineages in the Caenogastropoda, and tend to have a gill and an operculum. The largest clade of land snails is the Cyclophoroidea, with more than 7,000 species. Many of these operculate land snails live in habitats or microhabitats that are sometimes (or often) damp or wet, such as in moss. Land snails have a strong muscular foot; they use mucus to enable them to crawl over rough surfaces and to keep their soft bodies from drying out. Like other mollusks, land snails have a mantle, and they have one or two pairs of tentacles on their head. Their internal anatomy includes a radula and a primitive brain. In terms of reproduction, many caenogastropod land snails (e.g., diplommatinids) are dioecious, but pulmonate land snails are hermaphrodites (they have a full set of organs of both sexes) and most lay clutches of eggs in the soil. Tiny snails hatch out of the egg with a small shell in place, and the shell grows spirally as the soft parts gradually increase in size. Most land snails have shells that are right-handed in their coiling. A wide range of different vertebrate and invertebrate animals prey on land snails. They are used as food by humans in various cultures worldwide, and are raised on farms in some areas for use as food.

Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD This motion is powered by succeeding waves of muscular contractions that move down the ventral of the foot. This muscular action is clearly visible when a snail is crawling on the glass of a window or aquarium. Snails move at a proverbially low speed (1 mm/s is a typical speed for adult Helix lucorum). Snails secrete mucus externally to keep their soft bodies from drying out. They also secrete mucus from the foot to aid in locomotion by reducing friction, and to help reduce the risk of mechanical injury from sharp objects, meaning they can crawl over a sharp edge like a straight razor and not be injured. The mucus that land snails secrete with the foot leaves a slime trail behind them, which is often visible for some hours afterwards as a shiny \\"path\\" on the surface over which they have crawled. Snails (like all molluscs) also have a mantle, a specialized layer of tissue which covers all of the internal organs as they are grouped together in the visceral mass. The mantle also extends outward in flaps which reach to the edge of the shell and in some cases can cover the shell, and which are partially retractable. The mantle is attached to the shell, and creates the shell and makes shell growth possible by secretion. Most molluscs, including land snails, have a shell which is part of their anatomy since the larval stage, and which grows with them in size by the process of secreting calcium carbonate along the open edge and on the inner side for extra strength. Although some land snails create shells that are almost entirely formed from the protein conchiolin, most land snails need a good supply of calcium in their diet and environment to produce a strong shell. A lack of calcium, or low pH in their surroundings, can result in thin, cracked, or perforated shells. Usually a snail can repair damage to its shell over time if its living conditions improve, but severe damage can be fatal. When retracted into their shells, many snails with gills (including some terrestrial species) are able to protect themselves with a door-like anatomical structure called an operculum. Land snails range greatly in size. The largest living species is the Giant African Snail or Ghana Tiger Snail (Achatina achatina; Family Achatinidae), which can measure up to 30 cm. The largest land snails of non-tropical Eurasia are endemic Caucasian snails Helix buchi and Helix goderdziana from the south-eastern Black Sea area in Georgia and Turkey; diameter of the shell of the latter may exceed 6 cm Mumladze L., Tarkhnishvili D, Pokryszko B. 2008. A new species of the genus Helix from south-western Georgia. Journal of Conchology 39: 483-485 Most land snails bear one or two pairs of tentacles on their heads. In most land snails the eyes are carried on the first (upper) set of tentacles (called ommatophores or more informally 'eye stalks') which are usually roughly 75% of the width of the eyes. The second (lower) set of tentacles act as olfactory organs. Both sets of tentacles are retractable in land snails.  Digestion and nervous system  Light micrograph of a section through a snail's eye (Helix pomatia). 1 anterior chamber, 2 lens in the posterior chamber, 3 retina, 4 optic nerve The anatomy of a common snail Garden Snail, Cornu aspersum defecating A snail breaks up its food using the radula inside its mouth. The radula is a chitinous ribbon-like structure containing rows of microscopic teeth. With this the snail scrapes at food, which is then transferred to the digestive tract. In a very quiet setting, a large land snail can be heard 'crunching' its food: the radula is tearing away at the surface of the food that the snail is eating. The cerebral ganglia of the snail form a primitive brain which is divided into four sections. This structure is very much simpler than the brains of mammals, reptiles and birds, but nonetheless, snails are capable of associative learning.  Growth of the shell  As the snail grows, so does its calcium carbonate shell. The shell grows additively, by the addition of new calcium carbonate, which is secreted by glands located in the snail's mantle. The new material is added to the edge of the shell aperture (the opening of the shell). Therefore, the centre of the shell's spiral was made when the snail was younger, and the outer part when the snail was older. When the snail reaches full adult size, it may build a thickened lip around the shell aperture. At this point the snail stops growing, and begins reproducing. A snail's shell forms a logarithmic spiral. Most snail shells are right-handed or dextral in coiling, meaning that if the shell is held with the apex (the tip, or the juvenile whorls) pointing towards the observer, the spiral proceeds in a clockwise direction from the apex to the opening. File:Snail 9881.JPGSnail with a rightwardly spiraling shell File:Samsoncj snail 07.jpgSinistral (left-handed) species of snail from western India  Hibernation and estivation  Some snails hibernate during the winter (typically October through April in the Northern Hemisphere). They may also estivate in the summer in drought conditions. To stay moist during hibernation, a snail seals its shell opening with a dry layer of mucus called an epiphragm.  Reproduction  The use of love darts by the land snail Monachoides vicinus is a form of sexual selection Two Helicid snails make contact prior to mating. Two Helix pomatia snails mating The great majority of land snails are hermaphrodites with a full set of reproductive organs of both sexes, able to produce both spermatozoa and ova. A few groups of land snails such as the Pomatiidae, which are distantly related to periwinkles, have separate sexes: male and female. The age of sexual maturity varies depending on species of snail, ranging from as little as 6 weeks to 5 years. Adverse environmental conditions may delay sexual maturity in some snail species. Most pulmonate air-breathing land snails perform courtship behaviors before mating. The courtship may last anywhere between two and twelve hours. In a number of different families of land snails and slugs, prior to mating one or more love darts are fired into the body of the partner. Pulmonate land snails are prolific breeders and inseminate each other in pairs to internally fertilize their ova via a reproductive opening on one side of the body, near the front, through which the outer reproductive organs are extruded so that sperm can be exchanged. Fertilization then occurs and the eggs develop. Each brood may consist of up to 100 eggs. Garden snails bury their eggs in shallow topsoil primarily while the weather is warm and damp, usually 5 to 10 cm down, digging with their foot. Egg sizes differ between species, from a 3 mm diameter in the grove snail to a 6 mm diameter in the Giant African Land Snail. After 2 to 4 weeks of favorable weather, these eggs hatch and the young emerge. Snails may lay eggs as often as once a month. There have been hybridizations of snail species; although these do not occur commonly in the wild, in captivity they can be coaxed into doing so. Parthenogenesis has been reported only in one species of slug, but many species can self-fertilise.  Lifespan  Most species of land snail are annual, others are known to live 2 or 3 years, but some of the larger species may live over 10 years in the wild. For instance, 10-year old individuals of the Roman snail Helix pomatia are probably not uncommon in natural populations. Populations of some threatened species may be dependent on a pool of such long-lived adults. In captivity, the lifespan of snails can be much longer than in the wild, for instance up to 25 years in H. pomatia.The Roman snail or escargot (Helix pomatia)  Diet  In the wild, snails eat a variety of different foods. Terrestrial snails are usually herbivorous, however some species are predatory carnivores or omnivores, including the genus Powelliphanta, which includes the largest carnivorous snails in the world, native to New Zealand. The diet of most land snails can include leaves, stems, soft bark, fruit, vegetables, fungi and algae. Some species can cause damage to agricultural crops and garden plants, and are therefore often regarded as pests.  Predators  The larva of a glowworm (Lampyris noctiluca) attacking and eating a land snail In an attempt to protect themselves against predators, land snails retract their soft parts into their shell when they are resting; some bury themselves. Land snails have many natural predators, including members of all the land vertebrate groups, three examples being thrushes, hedgehogs and Pareas snakes. Invertebrate predators include decollate snails, ground beetles, leeches, certain land flatworms such as Platydemus manokwari and even the predatory caterpillar Hyposmocoma molluscivora. In the case of the marsh snail Succinea putris, the snails can be parasitized by a microscopic flatworm of the species Leucochloridium paradoxum, which then reproduces within the snail's body. The flatworms invade the snail's eye stalks, causing them to become enlarged. Birds are attracted to and consume these eye stalks, consuming the flatworms in the process and becoming the final hosts of the flatworm. Human activity poses great dangers to snails in the wild. Pollution and habitat destruction have caused the extinction of a considerable number of snail species in recent years.  Snails as human food  A snail farm in Provence Land snails have been eaten for thousands of years, going back at least as far as the Pleistocene. Archaeological evidence of snail consumption is especially abundant in Capsian sites in North Africa, but is also found throughout the Mediterranean region in archaeological sites dating between 12,000 and 6,000 years ago.Prehistoric edible land snails in the circum-Mediterranean: the archaeological evidence., D. Lubell. In J-J. Brugal & J. Desse (eds.), Petits Animaux et Soci√©t√©s Humaines. Du Compl√©ment Alimentaire Aux Ressources Utilitaires.

Budja (ed.), Neolithic Studies 11. Documenta Praehistorica XXXI: 1-24. D. Lubell. However, wild-caught land snails which are prepared for the table but are not thoroughly cooked, can harbor a parasite (Angiostrongylus cantonensis) that can cause a rare kind of meningitis. Snail eggs, sold as snail caviar, are a specialty food that is growing in popularity in European cuisine.  Africa  In parts of West Africa, specifically Ghana, snails are served as a delicacy. Achatina achatina, Ghana tiger snails, are also known as some of the largest snails in the world. In Cameroon, snails, usually called 'nyamangoro' and 'slow boys' are a delicacy especially to natives of the South West region of Cameroon. The snails are either eaten cooked and spiced or with a favourite dish called 'eru'. In North Morocco, small snails are eaten as snacks in spicy soup. The recipe is identical to this prepared in Andalusia (South Spain), showing the close cultural relationship between both kinds of cuisine.  Europe  Snails are eaten in several European countries, as they were in the past in the Roman Empire. Mainly three species, all from the family Helicidae, are ordinarily eaten: *Helix pomatia, or edible snail, generally prepared in its shell, with parsley butter (size: 40 to 55 mm for an adult weight of 25 to 45 g; typically found in Burgundy, France; known as l'Escargot de Bourgogne). *Helix lucorum, found throughout the Eastern Mediterranean region are commonly eaten in Greece and in some rural communities (ethnic Greeks and Georgian Catholics) in Georgia. *Cornu aspersum, synonym Helix aspersa: **Cornu aspersum, better known as the European brown snail, is cooked in many different ways, according to different local traditions (size: 28 to 35 mm for an adult weight of 7 to 15 g; typically found in the Mediterranean countries of Europe and North Africa and the French Atlantic coast; Helix aspersa aspersa known as le Petit-gris). **Cornu aspersum maxima (size 40 to 45 mm for an average weight of 20 to 30 g; typically found in North Africa). Snails are a delicacy in French cuisine, where they are called escargots. 191 farms produced escargots in France as of 2014. In an English-language menu, escargot is generally reserved for snails prepared with traditional French recipes (served in the shell with a garlic and parsley butter). Before preparing snails to eat, the snails should be fasting for three days with only water available. After three days of fasting, the snails should be fed flour and offered water for at least a week. This process is thought to cleanse the snails. Portuguese carac√≥is snack, species Theba pisana. Snails are also popular in Portuguese cuisine where they are called in Portuguese carac√≥is, and served in cheap snack houses and taverns, usually stewed (with different mixtures of white wine, garlic, piri piri, oregano, coriander or parsley, and sometimes chouri√ßo). Bigger varieties, called caracoletas (especially, Cornu aspersum), are generally grilled and served with a butter sauce, but other dishes also exist such as feijoada de carac√≥is. Overall, Portugal consumes about 4,000 tonnes of snails each year.According to the article Comemos tr√™s a quatro mil toneladas de carac√≥is por ano, by Joana Ferreira da Costa, in the 26 August 2007 edition (n.6358) of the daily newspaper P√∫blico . Cooked French escargots, species Helix pomatia Cooked Spanish \\"caracoles a la madrile√±a\\", species Cornu aspersum Traditional Spanish cuisine also uses snails (\\"caracoles\\" in Spanish; \\"caragols\\" or \\"cargols\\" in Catalan), consuming several species such as Cornu aspersum, Otala lactea, Otala punctata and Theba pisana. Snails are very popular in Andalusia, Valencia and Catalonia. There are even snail celebrations, such as the \\"L‚ÄôAplec del Caragol\\", which takes place in Lleida each May and draws more than 200,000 visitors from abroad. Small to medium-sized varieties are usually cooked in one of several spicy sauces or even in soups, and eaten as an appetizer. The bigger ones may be reserved for more elaborate dishes, such as the \\"arroz con conejo y caracoles\\" (a paella-style rice with snails and rabbit meat, from the inner regions of south-eastern Spain), \\"cabrillas\\" (snails in spicy tomato sauce, typical of western Andalusia) and the Catalan caragols a la llauna (grilled inside their own shells and then eaten after dipping them in garlic mayonnaise) and a la gormanda (boiled in tomato and onion sauce). In Greece, snails are especially popular in the island of Crete, but are also eaten in many parts of the country and can even be found in supermarkets, sometimes placed alive near partly refrigerated vegetables. In this regard, snails are one of the few live organisms sold at supermarkets as food. They are eaten either boiled with vinegar added, or sometimes cooked alive in a casserole with tomato, potatoes and squashes. Limpets and sea snails also find their way to the Greek table around the country. Another snail cooking method is the Kohli Bourbouristi (Œ∫ŒøœáŒªŒπŒøŒØ ŒºœÄŒøœÖ(œÅ)ŒºœÄŒøœÖœÅŒπœÉœÑŒøŒØ), a traditional Cretan dish, which consists of fried snails in olive oil with salt, vinegar and rosemary. They often feature on Cyprus taverna menus, in the meze section, under the name karaoloi (Œ∫Œ±œÅŒ¨ŒøŒªŒøŒπ). In Sicily, snails (or babbaluci as they are commonly called in Sicilian) are a very popular dish. They are usually boiled with salt first, then served with tomato sauce or bare with oil, garlic and parsley. Snails are similarly appreciated in other Italian regions, such as Sardinia. Snails (or bebbux as they are called in Maltese) are a dish on the Mediterranean island of Malta, generally prepared and served in the Sicilian manner. In southwestern Germany there is a regional specialty of soup with snails and herbs, called \\"Black Forest Snail Chowder\\" (Badener Schneckensuepple). Heliciculture is the farming of snails. Some species such as the Roman snail are protected in the wild in several European countries and must not be collected, but the Roman Snail and the Garden Snail (Cornu aspersum) are cultivated on snail farms. Although there is not usually considered to be a tradition of snail eating in Great Britain, common garden snails Cornu aspersum were eaten in the Southwick area of Sunderland in North East England. They were collected from quarries and along the stone walls of railway embankments during the winter when the snails were hibernating and had voided the contents of their guts. Gibson writes that this tradition was introduced in the 19th century by French immigrant glass workers. \\"Snail suppers\\" were a feature of local pubs and Southwick working men were collecting and eating snails as late as the 1970s, though the tradition may now have died out.  Oceania  Bulime cooked in garlic butter in Ile des Pins, New Caledonia, species Placostylus fibratus In New Caledonia, Placostylus fibratus (French: bulime) is considered a highly prized delicacy and is locally farmed to ensure supplies. It is often served by restaurants prepared in the French style with garlic butter.

It is mainly used by tourist / flightseeing operators.  Location  The Airport is located in the village Milford Sound located at the head of the fiord Milford Sound. It serves the Milford Sound tourism industry including boats, kayaks, Milford Track, as well as the fishing boats based at Milford Sound. It stands at the head of the fiord at the junction of the Cleddau and Arthur rivers.  History  On 17 November 1938, a Southland Airways Puss Moth piloted by Arthur Bradshaw made the first landing in at Milford Sound. However, any further development for air operations into the Fiord was delayed by World War II. Post war pilot Fred 'Popeye' Lucas was the next to land an aircraft in Milford. He landed on the sand spit in his Southern Scenic Airtrips Auster on 22 August 1951. This then sparked the addition of an airstrip for use by his company to expand tourism into Milford Sound. An airstrip was constructed, initially 550 yards (503 metres) in length with the first official landing achieved in May 1952. Over the years the airstrip has been upgraded and lengthened till today's sealed strip of 792 metres. In order for Southern Scenic Airtrips and National Airways Corporation (NAC) to be able to fly the larger twin-engine aircraft into the area the airstrip became officially licensed in 1956. Prior to the ability of air operations, Milford Sound had no access in the winter months as the roads became impassable. With the addition of the airstrip, it was recorded that by 1964 more than 400 tourists were taking the 'Gateway to Magnificence Experience' flight to Milford Sound each month at peak holiday time.'Taking Off-Pioneering Small Airlines of New Zealand 1945‚Äì1970' Published 2003, Richard Waugh with Bruce Gavin, Peter Layne & Graeme McConnell, Pages 16‚Äì36  Activity  A view of Milford Sound Airport from a Glenorchy Air GA8 aircraft The small terminal at Milford Sound Weather permitting, there is substantial daily charter traffic of light aircraft (mostly Britten-Norman Islander, Cessna 172, 206, 207, Cessna Caravan.

Crockett (who also recorded as \\"G. Davy Crockett\\") in the mid-1960s, and then popularized to rock audiences in the early 1970s and onward by The Allman Brothers Band. Song origins As with many blues songs, the history of \\"One Way Out\\" falls into murk. It seems to have been originally recorded by Elmore James at Beltone Studios in New York City in late 1960 or early 1961, as part of James' Fire/Fury/Enjoy recording sessions. It features a full band arrangement with a four-piece horn section, but a completely different melody from later versions. James appears not to have released it at that time. Instead, Sonny Boy Williamson II reworked and recorded it for Chess Records in Chicago in September 1961, releasing it shortly thereafter. He would then return and re-record a different working of it in September 1963, again for Chess in Chicago, this time with Buddy Guy on guitar and Lafayette Leake on piano. The two efforts were substantially different, with one dominated by harmonica playing while the other has the vamp and arrangement that would become familiar with the Allman Brothers' rendition. Subsequently, the initial Elmore James version of \\"One Way Out\\" was posthumously released in 1965, using it as the B-side of his single \\"My Bleeding Heart\\" for Sphere Sound Records. But by now, the song was associated with Sonny Boy not him. Writing credits for \\"One Way Out\\" have varied over the years, with some recordings crediting Sonny Boy alone, then others giving Marshall Sehorn and Elmore James the nod, and finally some naming all three. Furthermore, Sehorn was a recording engineer, record producer, and all-around \\"record man\\" at Fire/Fury Records in New York, who likely engaged in the then-common practice of adding himself onto composer credits of songs that he was not actually involved in writing, to get a cut of subsequent royalties. And of course no confusion is complete without mentioning that there are two different Sonny Boy Williamsons ‚àí I and II; \\"One Way Out\\" pertains to the second one. Whatever its origins, the song's narrative captures the classic tale of a man having an affair with another man's woman in an upstairs apartment. Another man shows up downstairs, and an alternate exit route must be found. : Ain't but one way out baby, Lord I just can't go out the door ‚Äî : Ain't but one way out baby, and Lord I just can't go out the door! : 'Cause there's a man down there, might be your old man ... I don't know. Under a different name In mid-1965, bluesman G.L. Crockett, from Carrollton, Mississippi, released yet another reworking of the song, now called \\"It's a Man Down There\\", on Four Brothers Records. It featured a slower tempo, a softer blues vocal line apparently styled after Jimmy Reed. \\"It's a Man Down There\\" became a big hit in R&B; circles, reaching number 10 on the Billboard Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles chart, and qualified the otherwise obscure Crockett for one-hit wonder status. Songwriting credits on this reworking appear to have been given to Crockett and one Jack Daniels. The Crockett track was included on the Time-Life album \\"Living the Blues: 1965-69,\\" part of the \\"Living the Blues\\" series. Indeed, so much was the vocal style like Reed, that Reed himself then recorded an answer song later that year, entitled \\"I'm the Man Down There\\", which became a small hit. In the same time period, under the name \\"The Man Down There\\", the Swedish band Melvins recorded a version of this song; it was released on an EP 1965 and later also included on Pebbles, Volume 26. In 1966, \\"It's a Man Down There\\" was given the Tex-Mex music treatment by the Sir Douglas Quintet on their debut album The Best of the Sir Douglas Quintet. The Beatles used the riff of the song during jams in 1969. It is instantly recognizable in a jam titled \\"My Imagination,\\" featuring Paul shouting simplistic vocals over the main riff for seven minutes, and later on a jam with Yoko Ono which incorporates the riff occasionally over its 16-minute span. Both tracks remain unreleased. Allman Brothers Band version Returning to the original title, The Allman Brothers Band is known to have been playing \\"One Way Out\\" in concert from at least February 1971. A live recording was included on their 1972 album Eat a Peach. This was indeed recorded at the Fillmore East, but unlike the March 1971 live material used on the rest of Eat a Peach and At Fillmore East, \\"One Way Out\\" was recorded at the venue's final show on June 27, 1971, as producer Tom Dowd thought that to be their definitive effort on the song. In this punchy, dynamic performance, the Allmans demonstrated their abilities in the blues-rock roadhouse style. Guitarist Dickey Betts sets up the Sonny Boy Williamson boogie vamp, while Duane Allman comes in over the top with bottleneck slide guitar part, after which vocalist Gregg Allman narrates the drama of the song. Betts takes a solo, Gregg instructs the audience \\"Ahh, put your hands together,\\" and Duane Allman and Betts trade guitar licks. Duane Allman then takes the solo. Bassist Berry Oakley actually comes in a beat early after the guitar trade, but the band recovers quickly, and then drops out as Gregg carries the vocal a cappella, after which the band returns for the \\"Big Ending\\". The recording of the song from Eat a Peach became popular on progressive rock and album-oriented rock radio formats, especially as it was under five minutes in length and more convenient to play than some of the band's lengthier jams; it remains quite popular on classic rock radio. \\"One Way Out\\" has become a staple of Allmans concerts in the decades since, often used as an encore and stretched in length. The Eat a Peach \\"One Way Out\\" is included in Martin Scorsese Presents the Blues: A Musical Journey, a box set accompanying his 2003 documentary The Blues. It is also on the soundtrack of Scorsese's 2006 film The Departed and the 2017 movie American Made (in heavily edited form); it was previously used in the soundtracks of Almost Famous (2000), Dogtown and Z-Boys (2001), and Lords of Dogtown (2005). It is included in the Allmans compilations Dreams (1989), A Decade of Hits 1969-1979 (1991), and Gold (2005). Other concert performances of it are included on various retrospective live albums, such as Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, NY: 5/1/73, which illustrates a rendition from the band's Chuck Leavell era.

Orridge's Psychic TV. The pair teamed up with the South London rapper Trevor Miles. Their debut album, Oui Love You, was released in 1993 and featured Jah Wobble on the title track. The album was produced and mainly mixed by the trio, although some tracks were mixed by Mark \\"Spike\\" Stent, Youth and Phil Bodger. A second album remained unreleased. Booth continued to write and record her own material, but little has been heard musically from Erb or Miles. Faithless have since cited Oui 3 as an influence.

The route runs through the central portion of the state, following generally the alignment of the former Northern Pacific Railway (now BNSF) and connects the cities of Moorhead, Detroit Lakes, Wadena, Little Falls, St. Cloud, Anoka, Saint Paul, and Cottage Grove. US 10 within Minnesota is in length. Route description US 10 enters the state from North Dakota and heads through Moorhead parallel to Interstate 94 (I-94) and U.S. Highway 52 (US 52) until it exits the city. US 10 then takes a more northerly route than I-94/US 52 to St. Cloud, by heading through Detroit Lakes, Wadena, and Little Falls. From St. Cloud to Mounds View, US 10 is a busy route through the suburbs of St. Cloud and Minneapolis. Concurrency of US 10 and MN 47 in Coon Rapids East of Mounds View, US 10 is marked mostly along Interstate Highways until Saint Paul, where the route runs concurrently with US 61 to Cottage Grove. US 10 then heads east to the Wisconsin state line and exits the state. US 10 is a divided highway along most of its length through the state, with posted speed limits along much of the way, except for two-lane or undivided four-lane stretches through Wadena and Motley. There are some posted speed limits in the four-lane section between Elk River and Anoka and the two-lane section between Bluffton and Wadena. Legally, the Minnesota section of US 10 is defined as unmarked Constitutional / Legislative Routes 2, 37, 27, 3, 62, and 94 in the Minnesota Statutes ¬ß¬ß 161.114(2) and 161.115(25).161.114, Minnesota Statutes 2006161.115, Minnesota Statutes 2006 US 10 is not marked with these legislative numbers along the actual highway. History US 10 was established on November 11, 1926. Originally, the route split between Moorhead and St. Cloud into US 10N and US 10S. In 1934, US 10S was replaced by US 52, (now I-94) and US 10N became simply US 10. US 10 in Minnesota was paved between St. Cloud and the Twin Cities as early as 1929. The remainder of the route was paved by 1950. The four-lane divided highway section between the cities of Elk River and Anoka was constructed by 1942. The freeway section of US 10 between the city of Anoka and University Avenue (at the Coon Rapids‚ÄìBlaine boundary line) was completed in the early 1970s. The new freeway section of US 10 between University Avenue and I-35W in Mounds View was completed in 1999. From 1934 to 1999, US 10 was located on a different alignment between Coon Rapids, Spring Lake Park, and Mounds View. This is now known as County Road 10. When I-694 and I-35E were completed in the late 1960s, US 10 was then signed concurrently with these highways east of Mounds View to the city of Saint Paul. As of 2017, US 10 in the Twin Cities Metro Area has been fully upgraded to a freeway from Anoka to Hastings (save for three signalized intersections at Burns Avenue, Warner Road, and Lower Afton Road).

The cluster is situated in the southern portion of the Serpens cloud (adjacent to the star-forming region known as W40). The stars are embedded in a dense filament of interstellar gas, which is part of the giant molecular cloud that has given rise to the cluster of young stars in W40. This entire complex is located at a distance of 1420 light-years (436 pc) from the Earth, and is approximately the same distance as the Serpens Main cluster. The cluster was uncovered by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. This discovery was made possible by the infrared capabilities of this space telescope, which were necessary because the stars are completely obscured by interstellar dust in the Serpens cloud at visible wavelengths. Hundreds of young stellar objects have been detected at mid-infrared objects using these data. X-ray observations by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory have also provided detailed information about the stellar cluster. And, the region has served as a laboratory for radio- wavelength studies of star formation in dense molecular filaments. The discovery of Serpens South is a direct result of the Gould's Belt Legacy project at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, which aims to study all prominent star-forming regions within about 1,600 light-years of Earth.Two Telescopes Combine to Probe Young 'Family' of StarsMission statement - Gould's Belt Survey The Gould Belt is a ring of molecular clouds and associated star-forming regions first described by astronomer Benjamin Gould in 1879. Although the Serpens Molecular cloud is too distant to formally be considered a member of the Gould Belt, it is often included in Gould Belt surveys. Serpens South is located half a degree west of the main W40 cluster and three degrees south of the Serpens Main cluster. The Serpens South cluster can be seen as a small group of stars near the top of this large-scale Spitzer mosaic, just to the right of the center, while the neighboring W40 (left side of the image) dominates in the mid-infrared.

Before her transition in 1999, she served in the cold war intercepting Soviet bomber planes, and was involved in the Gulf War and Bosnia Conflict. She switched to Battlefield Helicopters in 1992 and flew several operational tours post-transition, including, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan, before her retirement from the military in November 2014. Military career Caroline developed an interest in aviation as a teenager and achieved an RAF Flying Scholarship leading to a Private Pilots Licence when she was 17. She joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1980 and after completing Navigator Training at RAF Finningley she was posted to Phantom F4s in the Air Defence role at RAF Leuchars. Caroline flew 1500 hours on F4s and intercepted 34 Soviet long-range bomber aircraft when on Quick Reaction Alert (QRA) during the Cold War, she also completed tours providing Air Defence in the Falkland Islands. In 1989 she was posted to 63 Squadron RAF Chivenor flying Hawk T Mk1A on the Tactical Weapons Unit as an instructor/training officer for navigators undergoing Fast Jet conversion training and introducing student pilots to two-seat crew operations. In 1990 she was deployed with just one hours notice to Saudi Arabia, to help set-up and run a tactical air operations centre following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and in the buildup to the Gulf War. After completing her tour at Chivenor she accepted a request for fast jet navigators to re-role to Support Helicopters, to provide fast jet experience of operating a pilot/navigator cockpit on tactical operations. Upon completing helicopter training at RAF Shawbury she was posted to 60 Squadron at RAF Benson flying the Westland Wessex HC2. The following year Caroline completed a Helicopter Tactics Instructor Course, the beginning of a very active role in the training and preparation of crews for operational tactical flying. In 1995 she joined a UN Anglo-French Rapid Reaction Force (RRFOR) team operating from Kiseljak, Bosnia, where she became responsible for the co-ordination and safe routing of UN helicopter operations within Bosnia. She remained in Bosnia with NATO forces when they took on responsibility following the cease-fire. In 1997 Caroline helped set up the newly created Rotary Wing Operational Evaluation and Training Unit (RWOETU) at RAF Benson where she was responsible for the initial operational development and introduction of the new AW101 Merlin HC Mk3 helicopter into RAF service. In 1998 Caroline finally accepted she needed to resolve her lifelong battle with her gender identity and after informing the RAF of her need to transition she was accepted in service as a female officer. Eighteen months later she was publicly 'outed' on the front page of The Sun newspaper (10 August 2000). After a short tour at RAF Innsworth on the Recruiting Policy desk, working on the implementation of ethnic minority recruiting policy, she successfully agreed her return to RAF Benson, to join No 28 (AC) Squadron ready for its reformation as the first Squadron to receive the Merlin HC Mk3 Battlefield Helicopter. On completion of No.1 Merlin Operational Conversion Course Caroline worked to prepare and develop crew tactical readiness for the Squadron's deployment to Bosnia in 2003, in support of SFOR, and for Iraq in 2005. This experience saw her returning to RWOETU where she worked hard to evolve the aircraft platform protection systems and tactical training for crews, helping to improve survivability for crews and troops flying in hostile environments. Over a five-year period this work was recognised with two Commander Joint Helicopter Command Commendations for 'Exceptional Service' with a 3rd Commendation from the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Air Force in the Queen's New Year Honours List of 2012. During this period Caroline also completed a further three tours in Iraq, operating Merlin helicopters with 1419 Flt, and formed part of an Operational Evaluation team deploying to Afghanistan for the first Merlin deployment in 2009 and again in 2010. In 2011 she returned to 28 (AC) Sqn and completed a further two tours flying in Afghanistan. In her final two years of service she also helped RWOETU with the development and running of the European Defence Agency (EDA) Helicopter Tactics Course, instructed crews on the first two of these courses and advised EDA Project teams on future platform protection requirements for rotary wing aircraft. Her final role was to lead an EDA Mentor Team to Portugal in 2014 to train, evaluate and advise European helicopter crews participating in EXERCISE HOTBLADE 14, a multinational flying exercise involving military helicopters from six European nations. Caroline served in the RAF for thirty-five years and remained flying in thirty-four of them, she completed seventeen operational tours. Transitioning gender in the military Following her transition in early 1999 Caroline was influential in promoting transgender equality and inclusion in the UK Armed Forces. Her 2000 public 'outing' by The Sun newspaper led to much criticism of the decision to allow her to remain in the military. Critical, though unofficial and unqualified, voices declared transgender people would be a liability, especially if they were allowed to serve with front-line forces. UK Policy now permitted transgender individuals to serve in the military but, whilst the majority of personnel accepted the change in policy, very few understood what it meant to be transgender or how inclusion could succeed, they needed assurance that it was the correct decision. Caroline realised being a trailblazer and role model bore enormous responsibility; she had to succeed if she was going to prove her opponents wrong and to do that she would have to earn respect and be valued, not just as a member of the military but as someone who wasn't 'a liability on the front-line', in fact someone who was needed. In proving her own worth she also determined to help make the military a more inclusive environment for those following in her footsteps. She became an Equality and Diversity Adviser for the military in 2000, trained as a Mentor, became a member of the RAF LGBT Forum and Proud2Serve support groups, and participated as a key note speaker at several military conferences and training events throughout the UK. Her role as a trailblazer, positive role- model and champion of diversity in the UK Armed Forces earned her a Permanent- Under-Secretary, Ministry of Defence, Peoples Award in 2011. Caroline quickly saw the benefit of her open and honest approach as attitudes became more positive and understanding grew into support. Trailblazing in the military as a trans woman provided many difficult challenges but the unconditional support and friendship of so many of her colleagues, including those from all three services who had never met or worked with her directly, was a major factor in making the UK military the permissive and inclusive workplace it became, for her, for transgender individuals following, for people with other diverse challenges, for anyone. In 2014 Caroline advised the Palm Center, San Francisco State University, regarding a national commission offering implementation guidance seeking the inclusion of openly serving transgender personnel in the US military. Caroline was invited as a key panel member at a conference on 'Perspectives on Transgender Military Service From Around the Globe', held in Washington DC, co-sponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Palm Center. She also co-authored an Op-ed with Petty Officer Landon Wilson for CNN, entitled 'Both Transgender, but Unequal Paths in Military Service' http://cnn.it/12ka78t; and was interviewed on BBC The World Radio http://bit.ly/126yshT.

The manor of Almington was larger than William Pandulf's Creswell, Derrington and Moddershall manors. In 1811, Samuel Lewis stated that the township of Almington had a population of 340 people. In 1834, Peter Stray Broughton was stated to be the owner and lord of the manor of Almington, but Lieutenant- Colonel Dawes occupied Almington Hall. It remained in the Broughton family, and in 1913 it belonged to John Lambert Broughton who resided at Almington Hall.

It was first performed on 9 August 2007, at the Proms by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales, conducted by David Atherton. Puw was resident composer with the orchestra at the time. The piece The composition is based on part of Branwen's story from the Mabinogion, a collection of medieval Welsh tales, in which a group of warriors, lately returned from Ireland, feast in Harlech for seven years with the severed head of their leader, Bendigeidfran, at the head of the table. They then feast in Penfro for eight years in a hall with three doors and only remember the dreadful events that happened in Ireland when the third door opens.BBC Proms Guide 2007 The cheerful feasting is represented by a quotation of a Welsh folk tune. Each of the three doors in Penfro was represented by an instrument (trumpet, clarinet, violin) in a box in the Royal Albert Hall. The piece has a mixture of frantic, rhythmical sections and sections of \\"black-magical stasis\\". The piece uses novel sound combinations and effects: the opening of the first door is depicted with strumming of piano strings, and the forbidden door opens to the sound of rasping strings and a huge creak in the percussion section. There is then a nightmarish reel from a violinist, representing the memories of Ireland; the violinist at the first performance was positioned at the back of the Royal Albert Hall. Critical reception Critics generally responded well to the first performance. The Daily Telegraph critic described it as a \\"succession of vivid tableaux\\" and \\"liked the way it mixed pictorialism with broader expressions of mood and emotional states.\\". The Guardian critic described it as a \\"vivid score\\", saying that the partnership between composer and orchestra was \\"clearly bearing fruit\\" and noting the way that Puw used the huge orchestra with restraint. The Times said that Puw had a \\"knack for drama\\", \\"an orchestral ear\\" and \\"a winningly flexible technique\\". However, the critic added that the \\"spatial games played with the Albert Hall didn't amount to much, and the piece overall lacks weight\\", whilst commenting that Puw was a composer \\"well worth noting\\". A second performance took place as part of the Swansea Festival in 2008.

He is known for his porcelain works with agitprop and Soviet art imagery. Biography Adamovich was born in 1884. In 1907 he completed his studies at the Moscow Stroganov School of Art and Industrial Design and won a scholarship to study in Italy until 1909 when he was commissioned to design murals for buildings in St Petersburg and Moscow. His first significant commission was for mosaics for the tomb of the assassinated George I of Greece. A Red Star: a 1920 design by Adamovich Adamovich worked in Leningrad following the Russian Revolution and his two years service in the Revolutionary guard. The Imperial Porcelain Factory had been founded by Empress Elizabeth Petrovna in 1744 as the first porcelain factory in Russia. In 1918 it was renamed the State Porcelain factoryImperial Porcelain Factory, accessed 3 October 2010 and Adamovich was employed. He designed ceramics that reflected the aims of the new government in Russia. He worked there from 1918 to 1919 and he returned in 1921 for two years. Adamovich later went on to work at the Volkhov Ceramic Factory in Novgorod. In 1927 he returned to Moscow to design for the Dulevo Ceramic Factory. He is known for his porcelain works with agitprop and Soviet art imagery. Designs Adamovich's Kapital plate One of Adamovich's 1921 designs, Kapital was selected by British Museum director Neil MacGregor as object 96 in the A History of the World in 100 Objects, a series of radio programmes that started in 2010 as a collaboration between the BBC and the British Museum. The plate that was chosen had been designed in 1921 and shows a revolutionary worker stamping on the word \\"Kapital\\" in the Futurist style. The plate shows the worker releasing industrial power to benefit the people and not capitalists. His 1921 designs include He Who Works Not Eats Not, which illustrates the commitment to the revolution. The design on an approximately ten inch porcelain plate shows the head of Lenin, Red Star and ration books. This plates were seen as a new form of art for the Russian worker. The \\"Kapital\\" plate that was chosen for the BBC had actually been made twenty years before, in 1901, when the porcelain factory's production was reserved entirely for the Russian royal family. These plates had been stockpiled and were awaiting decoration. The revolutionary worker shown on the plate was meant to be releasing the revolutionary power to the workers. This plate was also being released from the exclusivity of Royal patronage and given to a wider audience. The 1921 plates were issued by the State Porcelain Factory and they were hand painted over the existing glaze. The plates would not have withstood regular use and were intended mainly for decoration. The plates carried a hammer and sickle as their makers' mark, but they also carried the mark from their original imperial manufacture twenty years before. At this time, the Russian people were starving, and what small production still took place in these factories was at least partially intended for export. It was noted that it was best to not paint over the original firing marks, as they commanded a premium from purchasers outside Russia. Adamovich was later employed for painting designs on Moscow's buildings, and he died in 1947. In his lifetime he had exhibited at a number of international exhibitions, and in 1925 he won a medal at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs in Paris.

This group has become one of the most established professional step teams in America, and is widely known as \\"America's Favorite Step Team\\".

Biography  Sigma Beta Steppers (2001) The Showtime Steppers originated in the late 1990s at Eastern Hills High School in Fort Worth. They were then known as the high school step team \\"Alpha and Omega\\" and later as the \\"Sigma Beta Steppers\\". After the first year, they were guided by Anthony Arnold, a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity and sponsored by Caprice Williams, a former teacher at the school. During the 2003-2004 school year, the group was undefeated, winning first place in over 20 step shows including that year's state championship step show. Because the steppers were not under direct sponsorship of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity and were not registered under the national Sigma Beta Club guidelines, the team began to run into complications using the name \\"Sigma Beta\\". Therefore, prior to the start of the 2004-2005 school year, the team was reformed under the name \\"Showtime Steppers\\". The name is based on one of their original routines in which they called out, \\"It's showtime in the house tonight and it's our time to get it hype!\\" In the fall of 2005, because of the graduation of all of the original group's members but one, a new team was formed by recruitment. This eventually led to a division of entities. The high school step team continued to perform under sponsorship at the high school and were occasionally supervised and assisted by the alumni (sometimes referred to as \\"The Brotherhood\\"). Meanwhile, the alumni also continued to perform on a national level.  Stepping  \\"Stepping\\" or \\"step-dancing\\" is a form of percussive dance in which the participant's entire body is used as an instrument to produce complex rhythms and sounds through a mixture of footsteps, spoken word, and hand claps. Though stepping may be performed by an individual, it is generally performed by groups of three or more, often in arrangements that resemble military formations. Stepping also draws from elements of gymnastics, tap dance, marching, and African and Caribbean dance, and can include semi-dangerous stunts as a part of individual routines. Some forms of stepping use props, such as blindfolds, canes, rhythm sticks, or fire. Popularized by the National Pan-Hellenic Council member organizations who perform at local and national competitions, stepping has been featured in films such as School Daze (1988), Mac and Me (1988), Drumline (2002), Stomp the Yard (2007), and How She Move (2008). Stepping has also been featured on TV shows including A Different World, Sister, Sister, BET's 106 & Park, and NBC's America's Got Talent.

In June 1944, two SS officers arrived by plane in Rhodes to hold discussions with Kleemann about the (Ladino speaking) Jews of Rhodes. On 13 July Kleemann issued an order ordering the Jewish population of Rhodes to gather in the city of Rhodes and the towns of Trianda, Cremasto and Villanova by noon on 17 July. On 16 July Kleemann was forced to issue another order stating that the Jewish question on Rhodes had apparently given rise to \\"doubts\\" and barring further questioning of orders by the troops. 1,700 members of the ancient Jewish community of Rhodes, out of a population of about 2,000, were rounded up and transported to mainland Europe. Only some 160 of them survived the camps. Out of 6,000 Ladino-speaking Jews in the Dodecanese as a whole, some 1,200 survived by escaping to the nearby coast of Turkey. From 27 November 1944 to 8 May 1945, Kleeman commanded Panzer Corps Feldherrnhalle on the Eastern Front. Kleeman's tank corps fought in Hungary and was destroyed in the Battle of Budapest.

Career Born in Canterbury, Kent, England, he served in the Royal Navy for over twenty years, attaining the rank of Commander. During his time in the Navy, he became a champion boxer and rugby player, and when he was discharged he was one of the youngest men ever to obtain the rank of Commander in the Royal Navy. After training at Central School of Speech and Drama, Gwillim began his acting career in earnest in the 1950s, working on both stage and screen. On stage, he appeared both at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford and at the Old Vic. He performed in an extensive amount of theatre, both classics and modern plays, in the West End of London and on Broadway. Some of his most notable roles include: playing in Sir Ralph Richardson's production of The Merchant of Venice; The Right Honourable Gentleman with lifelong friend Anthony Quayle; a revival of My Fair Lady with Rex Harrison, playing Colonel Pickering; John Gielgud's The Constant Wife, with Ingrid Bergman; and The Iceman Cometh, with James Earl Jones. Gwillim also featured in over fifty films and television series, usually war films or historical epics. His military background, commanding presence and deep, booming voice typecast him as soldiers and authority figures. Some of his most notable roles include playing a warship captain in Sink the Bismarck! (1960), the archbishop Hubert Walter in Sword of Sherwood Forest (1960), the obnoxious club secretary in Lawrence of Arabia (1962), King Ae√´tes in Jason and the Argonauts (1963), an RAF officer in the James Bond film Thunderball (1965), the Lord Chief Justice in A Man for All Seasons (1966), General Harold Alexander in Patton (1970), Poseidon in Clash of the Titans (1981), and Van Helsing in The Monster Squad (1987).

Published on September 17, 2007, the book debuted at the top of the New York Times Bestseller list for hardcover nonfiction. Penguin Press reportedly paid him an $8 million advance. Overview The first half of The Age of Turbulence is an autobiographical chronology of Greenspan's life that shows readers the people and circumstances that helped shape and guide Greenspan‚Äîfrom hours of clarinet and saxophone practice to living-room philosophy with Ayn Rand. The second half of the book retells several major economic events (primarily within the United States) that have occurred over the past half century. It details his economic endeavors and personal observations while serving under various U.S. presidents and are often intermingled with the economic events. The latter half of the book also includes an analysis and brief history of major global economic constructs‚ÄîMarxist communism, populism, and various mutations of market capitalism‚Äîalong with Greenspan's opinions about their relative merits and shortcomings. Greenspan said that he wrote the book in longhand mostly while soaking in the bathtub, a habit he regularly employed since an accident in 1971, when he injured his back. On free market capitalism In Greenspan's view, free market capitalism is the economic approach that \\"trumps\\" other forms attempted thus far in human history. His support of Adam Smith's \\"invisible hand\\", i.e., people's motivational self-interest, is foundational to his view of creating a successful, growing economy. He discusses the rapid historical growth of the U.S. economy under market capitalism as well as its benefit to foreign adopters, albeit with persistent dis-functions. His support for market capitalism is not without criticism. This includes the anxiety often expressed within a society as \\"creative destruction\\" plays out. Greenspan also decries the lack of quality public secondary education for the \\"masses\\", particularly in mathematics and the sciences, and how this problem contributes to the divergence of rich and poor within the United States. \\"The book ends on an awkward note that the conditions that led to a substantial reduction in the inflation and interest rates in the past three decades were an accident and are not likely to be repeated. How sad.\\" On presidential economic influence Greenspan's criticisms of President George W. Bush include his refusal to veto new federal legislation, thus increasing spending with unprecedented ease. In Greenspan's opinion, Bush's approach to dealing with the congress has been one of \\"conflict avoidance\\", and fulfilling political promises/agendas with little room for compromise or reason. Greenspan writes, \\"[Republicans in Congress] swapped principle for power; they ended up with neither...they \\"deserved to lose\\" the 2006 midterm elections. One of his book's major themes is the \\"continuing struggle of successive administrations to achieve fiscal balance\\". Of all the presidents with whom he worked, Greenspan praises Gerald Ford above all others, but also has high praise for Bill Clinton. His opinion of Clinton's governance was one which maintained \\"a consistent, disciplined focus on long-term economic growth\\". Reviews The Economist considered the book to be \\"first-rate\\", noting that \\"it engages on different levels: it is intelligent in a way that few popular books on economics manage or even try to be; and, wonder of wonders, it is a good read\\". The New York Times‚Äôs David Leonhardt said that it was \\"surprisingly frank\\" and often \\"downright entertaining\\". However, he gave it an overall thumbs down (\\"it isn‚Äôt a great memoir\\") due to Greenspan's \\"reluctance to be as forthright and penetrating about himself as he is about others\\". In the New York Review of Books, Benjamin M. Friedman was largely praising of the book, describing it as \\"clearly written and easy to read and understand\\" and says that Greenspan is \\"forthright in sharing his views on not only policy issues but also the personalities of many of the people with whom he worked during his time in office. His opinions frequently run counter to his well-known Republican political loyalties, which he also makes no effort to hide\\".

Built about 1769, it is a well-preserved example of Georgian architecture, its only principal alteration the Italianate entrance surround. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 15, 1996. Description and history The house stands on the north side of Jordan Lane, just east of its junction with Wolcott Hill Road. The Wilbur Cross Parkway passes on an embankment at the rear of the house, giving it a triangular lot. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a large central chimney and a centered entrance. Porches, probably added in the mid-19th century, are on the east and back sides. The front entrance was at one time sheltered by an Italianate hood, but that has been removed; it now has a simpler Georgian surround with corniced entablature. The interior retains a nearly complete set of original flooring, woodwork, and door hardware. The house was built c. 1769, and remained in the hands of his descendants until 1954. The Butler family was long prominent in the area, its progenitor, Deacon Richard Butler, arriving in 1633. William Butler purchase the land this house stands on in 1767, and probably built this house two years later as a wedding gift for his son Roger.

The mountain is a rare instance of a bare-rock summit in the Smokies. Charlies Bunion rises to an elevation of 5,565 feet (1,696 m) above sea level, and is situated along the state line between Sevier County, Tennessee and Swain County, North Carolina. The Appalachian Trail crosses the mountain's northern slope some four miles (6 km) east of Newfound Gap, allowing easy access to dayhikers and rock climbers. Geology The characteristic boulder-like protrusion on northern face of Charlies Bunion, with the summit rising on the right Charlies Bunion comprises the western wing of The Sawteeth, a series of narrow, jagged cliffs connecting the high peaks of the Central Smokies with the high peaks of the Eastern Smokies. These cliffs are underlain by a Precambrian metamorphic rock of the Ocoee Supergroup known as \\"Anakeesta Formation,\\" which consists mainly of slate.Harry Moore, A Roadside Guide to the Geology of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1988), 11. The Anakeesta Formation, which comprises much of the crest of the Central Smokies, was created nearly a billion years ago from ancient ocean sediments. The rock was thrust upward during the Appalachian orogeny, when the North American and African plates collided around 400 million years ago.Ibid., 23-27. The steep northern face of Charlies Bunion is drained by the headwaters of the Middle Fork of the Little Pigeon River, and loses 2,000 feet (609 m) in elevation in just over a mile. The southern face, which is more gradual, is drained by the headwaters of the Oconaluftee River, specifically Kephart Prong and Bradley Fork. History The view looking northwest from Charlies Bunion, with Mount Le Conte rising on the left Other than the occasional surveyor or naturalist, few people ventured to the Sawteeth before the 1900s. This area of the Smokies was part of a stretch of wilderness described by Horace Kephart as \\"so rough that you could not make seven miles a day in it to save your life...\\"Horace Kephart, Our Southern Highlanders (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1976), 64. While the main route across the crest of the Smokies was the old Indian Gap Trail (now U.S. Route 441), which crested between Newfound Gap and Clingmans Dome, an alternative route was to ascend Kephart Prong to Dry Sluice Gap, on the eastern flank of Charlies Bunion, and descend into the Porters Creek Valley. The Whaley brothers, William and Middleton, used this route around 1800 while traveling from Oconaluftee to what is now Greenbrier.Carson Brewer, Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Portland, Ore.: Graphic Arts Center Publishing, 1993), 18. Charlies Bunion, like most of the central crest of the Smokies, was fairly heavily forested until the 20th century. Large-scale logging operations in the Oconaluftee valley, however, left large piles of dry, dead brushwood scattered about the streambeds above Smokemont. In 1925, a massive forest fire, feeding off this dry foliage, raced up Kephart Prong, and quickly spread across the Sawteeth and over into Tennessee. The heat from the fire was so intense, it not only scorched every plant in its path, but it rendered the soil sterile. Then in 1929, a cloudburst dumped torrential rains on the Smokies, washing away the scalded soil from the western flank of the Sawteeth and giving it its current rocky appearance.Daniel Pierce, The Great Smokies: From Natural Habitat to National Park (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2000), 29. The view looking northeast from Charlies Bunion, with the Porters Creek Valley below A few days after the 1929 cloudburst, a group of mountaineers led by Horace Kephart climbed to the crest of the Central Smokies to inspect the damage. When they reached the now-barren western flank of the Sawteeth, Charlie Conner, a mountain guide from Oconaluftee, removed his shoe, revealing a badly-swollen foot. Upon seeing this, Kephart was said to have remarked, \\"I'm going to get this put on a Government map for you.\\"Michael Frome, Strangers In High Places: The Story of the Great Smoky Mountains (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 1994), 110-111. There is another, slightly different, story told by Paul M. Fink in his book \\"The Names and Lore of The Great Smoky Mountains\\" in which Fink says that one of the group upon looking at the bare rock pinnacle left by the storm, and knowing of Conner's foot affliction, remarked: \\"Well that sticks out like Charlie's bunion\\" prompting Kephart to decide on that name. The United States Geological Survey gave it the name \\"Charlie's Bunion\\" shortly thereafter. The mountain rising above Charlies Bunion to the west was named after Kephart himself. In 1935, the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed a leg of the Appalachian Trail across the northern face of Charlies Bunion for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which had officially opened the previous year.Sherrill Hatcher, \\"The Appalachian Trail In the Smokies,\\" Smoky Mountain Historical Society Newsletter 20, no. 3 (May‚ÄìJune 1994): 2. Today, the mountain's summit and characteristic boulder-like protrusion offer great views of Tennessee and the other peaks of the main ridge in the Smokies, especially Mount Le Conte and Mount Kephart.

She was executed on 2 November 2001 at the age of 45, after being convicted of the murder of a politician, Mazlan Idris in 1993. Murder of Mazlan Idris After leaving the music business, she became involved in black magic activities and was known to be a bomoh, a local shaman. She began offering her services to clients, mostly from the upper-class society. She also claimed to have provided politician clients in the ruling party with a variety of charms and talismans. It was reported that Mazlan Idris, a state assemblyman for the constituency of Batu Talam, in the state of Pahang, wanted to boost his political career and sought the services of Mona for assistance. Mazlan was educated in the United States and was an ambitious politician from the ruling United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party. At the time, Mona worked with her husband Mohamad Nor Affandi Abdul Rahman, 44, and their assistant Juraimi Hassan, 31. Mona convinced Mazlan that he would be \\"invincible\\" if he had a talisman and the cane and songkok which were said to belong to the late Indonesian President Sukarno.\\"Black magic mayhem\\" , The Star, 25 July 2007. In return, Mona demanded RM 2.5 million. Mazlan paid the couple RM 500,000 as deposit, and gave them 10 land titles as surety for the remaining RM 2 million. An appointment was made for cleansing rituals to be performed at Mona's house. Mazlan was told to lie on the floor face up while Mona placed flowers on him. She then told Mazlan to close his eyes and wait for the money to \\"fall from the sky\\". Juraimi then, using an axe, chopped Mazlan's head off. They also dismembered and partially skinned Mazlan's body. His body was found in 18 parts buried in a storeroom near Mona's house in Kampung Peruas, Ulu Dong, Raub Pahang. Trial and execution Mazlan was reported missing on 2 July 1993 after withdrawing RM 300,000 from a bank. After the murder, Mona was reported to have been on a shopping spree where she bought a Mercedes-Benz and had a facelift. It was alleged that the murder occurred between 10:00 PM and midnight on 18 July 1993. On 22 July 1993, police found Mazlan's body; Mona, her husband and Juraimi were arrested and a highly publicised trial began. They were tried in Temerloh High Court by a 7-person jury (trial by jury was abolished from 1 January 1995). The High Court found all three of them guilty and sentenced them to death by hanging. Mona and the others filed appeals to the Federal Court and in 1999, the court dismissed their appeals and upheld the death sentence. Finally, the three convicts sought to obtain a pardon from the Pardons Board of Pahang, their final chance of redemption. However, the board refused to give clemency. The three were given a last meal of KFC on the night before their execution. Mona, Affandy and Juraimi were hanged on 2 November 2001 at Kajang Prison. A prison official said the trio expressed no remorse at the pre-dawn execution.\\"Malaysia hangs three for witchcraft murder.\\", BBC News, 2 November 2001. Accessed 12 June 2008.

Anti-death penalty movements including Amnesty International voiced their opposition to the execution of the trio.\\"Malaysia: Imminent execution\\", Amnesty International. Accessed 14 August 2007. In 2002, Malaysian film director Amir Muhammad made a short film entitled Mona in his 6horts series. In 2006, a film by Dain Iskandar Said entitled Dukun was widely assumed to be based on Mona Fandey. The public screening of this highly anticipated film was constantly pushed back, most likely due to concerns relating to the contents of the film, the relationship with Mona Fandey, and the implications for her family.Koay, Allan, \\"Will Dukun ever charm viewers?\\" , The Star, 3 June 2007. However, the movie was leaked online through Facebook early February 2018. The movie was released in cinemas on 5 April 2018. The Mona Fandey affair was one of the last jury trials to be conducted in Malaysia. The sensational nature of the case contributed toward the government's decision to discontinue the jury system.

He was of the Anabaptist faith. He collected naturalia (shells, insects, corals, birds, lizard and small mammals as wet preparations) and artificialia - (ethnography, paintings and drawings of flowers). Vincent and his wife, Joanna van Breda, took a lot of effort to present their collectables in a pleasurable and instructive spectacle. They ordered their shells and insects in elegant designs that resembled magnificent pieces of embroidery. Levinus Vincent aimed at the non-Latin-speaking public, printing the catalogue of his collection in both Dutch and French - Wondertooneel der Nature (Wonder Theater of Nature), giving details of all the objects on display. This catalogue sold for three guilder plus a tip or entrance fee of two guilder. He had fixed hours for its visitors. His visitor book (from 1705 to 1737) includes at least 3,500 entries, including Peter the Great. Levinus Vincent first lived in Amsterdam, and in 1705 he moved to Haarlem. After the death of his second wife in 1715, he remarried a woman who did not like his collection or hobby. Vincent moved to the Hague, hoping to find a buyer among its many diplomats for his cabinet. He corresponded with such friends as James Petiver and Hans Sloane in England. Sources * Driessen, J. (1996) Tsaar Peter de Grote en zijn Amsterdamse vrienden.

Early life and education He grew up on Long Island and graduated from Colgate University in 1965. Subsequently, he served in the U.S. Peace Corps in eastern Nigeria (Biafra), then settled in northern California where many of his books are set. Career He published Laughing in the Hills, his first book, a classic account of racetrack life, in 1980. William Shawn, editor of The New Yorker, ran a two-part excerpt from the book and appointed Barich a staff writer. His contributions over the next fifteen years fall into three categories: travel and the sporting life; reportage; and short fiction. Traveling Light, his account of a sojourn abroad in Italy and England, appeared in 1984, after which he won a Guggenheim Fellowship in Fiction. His other books include Hard to Be Good (stories); Big Dreams: Into the Heart of California (travel); Carson Valley (novel); Crazy for Rivers (angling/autobiography); and A Fine Place to Daydream (travel/racing). Barich's work has been included in Best American Short Stories and many other anthologies. In addition to The New Yorker, he has contributed to Esquire, Sports Illustrated, American Poetry Review, Salon, Narrative, and other magazines and journals, and he is a Literary Laureate of the San Francisco Public Library. He travels between Santa Monica, California and Dublin, Ireland. He has also written a book entitled A Pint of Plain, an account of his setting out to find a traditional authentic Irish pub. It is a lament of sorts as he is seeking the famous Pat Cohan-type pub of the John Wayne film \\"The Quiet Man.\\" In 2010, Barich published Long Way Home: On the Trail of Steinbeck's America his account of a 5,943-mile cross-country trip undertaken in the autumn of 2008 just prior to the presidential election. He assesses the state of the nation in much the same way John Steinbeck did almost fifty years ago in Travels With Charley.

Research Studies of files of witch trials reveal that some features of Hungarian folklore are remnants of shamanistic beliefs, maintained from the deep past, or possibly borrowed from Turkic peoples with whom Hungarians lived before wandering to the Pannonian Basin;Di√≥szegi 1998 or maybe is an effect of Eastern influence thereafter (Cuman immigration).Bartha J√∫lia: A Kuns√°g n√©pi kult√∫r√°j√°nak keleti elemei These remnants are partly conserved as fragments by some features of customs and beliefs, for example * refrains of certain folksongs accompanying some customs; * certain motifs of folktales, e.g. sky- reaching tree, which was a specific belief among several Finno-Ugric peoples, having some resemblances to the world tree concept, but it was also related to the shaman's tree and had some other peculiarities as well.Hopp√°l 1975:216‚Äì218,224,229 Characteristics There were also people who filled similar roles to those performed by shamans among other peoples: fortune- telling, weather magic, finding lost objects. These people are related to shamanism (in contrast to the cunning folk of non-shamanistic cultures), because the former are recorded to go through similar experiences to those of many shamans: being born with physical anomalies such as surplus amount of bones or teeth, illness, dismemberment by a mythological being and recovering with greater or increased capabilities, or struggle with other shamans or beings. Related features can be recognized in several examples of shamanism in Siberia. As the Hungarian language belongs to the Uralic family, we can expect to find them among other peoples who speake Uralic languages. Some of them maintained shamanism until modern times. Especially the isolated location of Nganasan people, made it possible that shamanism was a living phenomenon among them even at the beginning of 20th century.Hopp√°l 2005 The last notable Nganasan shaman's seances were recorded on film in the 1970s.Hopp√°l 1994:62 The original location of the Proto-Uralic peoples (and its extent) is debated. The combined results of several sciences suggest that this area was north of Central Ural Mountains and on lower and middle parts of the Ob River. This approach combined ecological, namely phytogeographical and paleobotanic (including palynologicalKlima 1998: 29) data together with linguistic (phytonymic and comparative) considerations: the distribution of various tree species in Siberia and Eastern Europe (changing over time) was matched against the distribution of the respective tree-names in various Uralic languages (filtered with comparative methods, so that only names of Proto-Uralic relevance be taken into account).Hajd√∫ 1975:32‚Äì35  Artifacts  Some artifacts, see online available pictures and descriptions:Magyar N√©prajz, list of figures * Sky-reaching tree standing on a hill, with a celestial body top left, and cattle on both lower and upper levels.

Drawn by Dud√°s Jul√≥, Galgam√°csa. Not online.Di√≥szegi 1998:345  Soul dualism  Soul dualism can be observed in several cultures in many variations: people are believed to have more than one soul. Examples can be found in several North Eurasian cultures, in some Eskimo groups;Merkur 1985: 222‚Äì223, 226, 240Kleivan & Sonne 1985: 17‚Äì18Gabus 1970: 211 and a majority of Finno-Ugric peoples, including Hungarians. Some of the many examples distinguish two souls: a body soul for maintaining bodily functions, and a free soul which can leave the body (even during life), with great variations on this theme among cultures. In some cultures, it may be related to shamanic concepts.Hopp√°l 1975: 225Hopp√°l 2005: 27‚Äì28 In shamanistic beliefs of some Eskimo groups, the shaman's \\"spirit journey\\", with his helping spirits, to remote places is explained with such soul concepts. It is the shaman's free soul that leaves his body. According to an explanation, this temporal absence of the shaman's free soul is tracked by a substitute: the shaman's body is guarded by one of his/her helping spirits during the spirit journey,Oosten 1997: 92 also a legend contains this motif while describing a spirit journey undertaken by the shaman's free soul and his helping spirits.Bar√ºske 1969: 24 As mentioned, it was also observed among Hungarians. The body soul, l√©lek was related to breathing (shown by etymology).V√©rtes 1990: 5 The shadow soul called √≠z was related to the roaming soul of the dead. Its feared nature can be seen, as it features also in curse expressions: ‚ÄúVigyen el az √≠z!‚Äù (= ‚Äúthe shadow soul take you!‚Äù).Dienes 1975: 83 This curse is unknown for most people nowadays, and word \\"√≠z\\" (in this meaning) is also unknown, or felt as an archaism with forgotten meaning.

BAAL's creation was the result of a proposal by Peter Strevens, recently appointed to a new Chair in Applied Linguistics at the University of Essex. At a preliminary meeting of interested parties at Birkbeck College in July 1965, a narrower remit was discussed than the wider set of issues that the Association would ultimately concern itself with. Initially, it was suggested that it might focus on language teaching and machine translation, but the first full meeting in 1967 at the University of Reading agreed to broaden the scope. BAAL emerged as the UK affiliate of AILA, with Pit Corder its first Chair. Membership was narrowly defined in the early years, but a feeling that the Association could afford to widen recruitment was apparent by the early 1970s. In 1985, a requirement for formal qualifications, already flexible, was dropped; and today anyone can join. The BAAL Archive is housed in the Centre for Applied Linguistics, University of Warwick.

Early life Born in London, England in 1970 to parents of Sicilian, British and American ancestry, Anna spent her younger years in London and the Netherlands. Anna's mother was a singer in various bands in the local London music scene and thus exposed Anna to a variety of musical genres, from Billie Holiday to Madonna. Anna attended the Sylvia Young Theatre School in London. Prince years At the age of 16, Anna met the musician Prince at his concert in London. At 17, she lived with Prince in Minneapolis, Minnesota. On Anna's 18th birthday, Prince gave her a pink cashmere coat, thus leading to the song \\"Pink Cashmere\\" that would be released in 1993. In 1988, under the name Sheree, she recorded a song called \\"Ronnie ‚Äì Talk To Russia!\\", written by German songwriter and former member of Modern Talking, Dieter Bohlen. Anna inspired the songs \\"Vicki Waiting\\" (an 18th-birthday gift for Anna, originally titled \\"Anna Waiting\\") and \\"Lemon Crush\\" (her favorite drink) on Prince's Batman soundtrack from 1989. She also wrote the song \\"Fantasia Erotica\\", which resurfaced on Carmen Electra's debut album in 1992. Liner notes from the Batman soundtrack, released in 1989, credits Garcia as \\"Anna Fantastic\\". Anna is featured on the unreleased, Prince's Madhouse album, on the 18-minute song \\"The Dopamine Rush Suite\\", and is credited to Anna Garcia. Post-Prince years Anna recorded several songs in the early to mid-1990s including \\"G'Ding ‚Äì G'Ding (Do You Wanna Wanna?)\\" in 1990 as Anna G, a remake of Marvin Gaye's \\"Sexual Healing\\" in 1994 under her real name, as well as singles in 1995 as part of the groups La Switch (\\"Kiss Me Baby\\" and \\"Never Let You Go!\\") and Positive Connextion (\\"My Baby Just Cares For Me\\"). Current Anna is the writer and executive producer of a documentary on Michael Jackson entitled Michael Jackson: The Last Photo Shoot,. recorded an album of jazz songs.

These antibodies are directed against oligomannose sequences Œ±-1,3 Man (Œ±-1,2 Man Œ±-1,2 Man)n (n = 1 or 2). ASCAs and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (pANCAs) are the two most useful and often discriminating biomarkers for colitis. ASCA tends to recognize Crohn's disease more frequently, whereas pANCA tend to recognize ulcerative colitis. ASCA antibodies react to a yeast protein with mannans, a 200-kDa glycoprotein.  Diseases  Diseases in which ASCA are found include the following: * Beh√ßet's disease \\\\- The association with ASCA is not generally strong, but increased in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. *Coeliac disease * Colitis ** Ulcerative colitis-familial. ** Microscopic colitis *** Collagenous colitis *Crohn's diseaseYeast S. cerevisiae, the cells are bordered by cell wall that contains the antigen for ASCA Intestinal yeast and ASCA positive Intestinal yeast infections are seen in malabsorptive diseases like coeliac disease. In Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis the presence of intestinal S. cerevisiae is rare, but the association with irritiable bowel in coeliac disease remains unstudied. Anti-mannans A photomicrograph of Candida albicans showing hyphal outgrowth and other morphological characteristics. Mannan (oligomannan) is a component of the yeast cell wall. Antibodies to yeast mannans are found at increased frequency in Crohn's disease and ASCA positive Crohn's tend to have lower low levels of mannan-binding lectin. Experimentally, antibodies to mannans from yeast can also crossreact to mannans of other types of yeast. Study of the sugars indicated that a mannotetraose (4-mer) was responsible for highest response. Studies of the 200 kDa glycoprotein antibodies found them commonly in healthy people, suggesting that the disease associated antibodies are to their carbohydrate moieties. Mannans from other yeast, for example candida albicans, have found to cross react with ASCA which suggests that other yeast may induce ASCA associated diseases. ASCA are serological markers of candida albicans infections in humans and animals. Mannan-binding lectin (MBL) is a lectin produced by humans. In ASCA positive Crohn's disease the serum level of this protein is lower. Cellular response to mannan in ASCA positive peripheral blood lymphocytes could be inhibited by adding MBL, however, a high frequency of mutations in the MBL gene was found in ASCA positive patients. Besides, MBL serum levels were inversely correlated with ASCA levels in Crohn's disease patients with severe clinical phenotypes. Crohn's disease ASCA are consistently higher in frequency in Crohn's disease. Yeast cause a three-fold increase in lymphocyte proliferation relative to normal controls. The ASCA antibodies are also more frequently found in familial Crohn's disease. An altered humoral and cellular response to mannan is observed and may be due to a loss of yeast tolerance. This alteration is marked by increased activation markers, CD25/CD69, upon proliferative stimulation of T-helper lymphocytes. ASCA positive is a predictor for Crohn's disease with high specificity and positive predictive value (87% and 78% respectively). ASCA are associated with proximal (gastroduodenal and small bowel involvement) rather than purely colonic disease (P < 0.001) and with a more severe disease phenotype and requirement for surgery over a median follow-up time of 9 years (P < 0.0001). There is no association between genetic markers for Crohn's disease and NOD2 protein (also known as CARD15) or antibodies to mycoprotein antigen (IgA or IgG), indicating heterogeneous causes for Crohn's disease. Experimental studies show that chemically-induced colitis promotes opportunistic human fungal pathogen Candida albicans colonization. In turn, Candida albicans colonization generates ASCA. According to another study, serum samples from patients with invasive candidiasis demonstrated that ASCA levels are significantly elevated compared to healthy controls, but the same, statistically, as of those with Crohn's disease.

The Alethinophidia are an infraorder of snakes that includes all snakes other than blind snakes and thread snakes. Snakes have long been grouped into families within Alethinophidia based on their morphology, especially that of their teeth. More modern phylogenetic hypotheses using genetic data support the recognition of 19 extant families (see below), although the taxonomy of alethinophidian snakes has long been debated, and ultimately the decision whether to assign a particular clade to a particular Linnaean rank (such as a superfamily, family, or subfamily) is arbitrary.  Etymology  The infraorder name Alethinophidia derives from the two Ancient Greek words (), meaning \\"truthful, genuine\\", and (), meaning \\"snake\\".  Fossil record  Fossils of alethinophidians were found in Late Cretaceous sites of Wadi Milk Formation in Wadi Abu Hashim, Sudan. Coniophis presents the vertebral morphology similar to modern-day Aniliidae. Two extinct families from the same location, the Anomalophiidae and Russellophiidae, also belong to the Alethinophidia. Krebsophis is the earliest russellophiid. The family Nigerophiidae includes both aquatic Nubianophis from Wadi Abu Hashim and Nigerophis from the Palaeocene of Niger.

Electronic bite alarms as used by carp anglers  Types  There are many types of bite indicators. Which ones work best depends on the type of fishing. * Fishing floats: widely used as bite indicators. Fishing floats are usually \\"cocked\\" by different split shot weights so that just the brightly coloured tip of the float is showing above the water surface. * Quiver tips: attached onto the end of the fishing rod. These can be screw in or push in and come in different weights of test curve for sensitivity and application, such as river and stillwater use. * Swing Tip: similar to quiver tips but hang off the tip of the rod and pull up into a horizontal position during a bite. These are usually screw in and are not as common as quiver tips. * Bite alarms: electronic devices which bleep when a fish tugs a fishing line. The fishing line is wound on a running roller which makes a noise when the fishing line moves, thus alerting the angler that a fish might be hooked.Bite indicators They are attached to the fishing rod between the reel and the first eye on the rod, and give an audible alert when there is a simple movement of the line. Bite alarms can range from simple devices with an on/off switch that do no more than indicate when the line moves over the roller, to more sophisticated devices with volume, tone and sensitivity controls. They are useful when fishing with more than one rod, and are commonly used when coarse fishing for carp. Whereas floats can be used as visual bite detectors, bite alarms are audible bite detectors. Although more expensive than visual devices, audible devices are popular as they do not require constant monitoring. They were invented by Richard Walker. Bite alarms are particularly useful for night fishing as they have lights that glow brightly when a fish is biting. They are powered by batteries so ensure you keep spares in your bag. Well known brands include Delkim, Nash, Fox to name a few and can range in price from as low as $20 to $200 depending on the quality, robustness and sensitivity you require. Delkim bite alarms differ from many others because they use a piezo vibration sensing system, as opposed to rollers, thus allowing very high levels of sensitivity and bite detection. Some alarms contain radio wireless technology allowing anglers to use receivers which make audible and visual alerts when an alarm is activated, particularly useful when night fishing and anglers may be sleeping on the bank side in bivvies during long stay sessions.

He is a recipient of the civilian honour of Padma Shri (1992). Early life Singh was born on 1 April 1947 at Sansarpur, a small village near Jalandhar Cantonment of Punjab, which was famous as a breeding ground for the hockey stars as this village had been home to a number of international hockey players who had done the nation proud with their commendable performance in the game. Domestic Hockey At the age of 7 or 8 years, little Ajit had been handed over a Hockey stick by his uncle. He studied at the Cantonment Board Higher Secondary School, Jalandhar Cantonment and at the age of 16 years represented the Punjab State Schools Hockey team in 1963. During his initial days, Ajit used to play at the Full Back position. He moved to the Lyallpur Khalsa College, Jalandhar in 1964, and stayed there for a period of 4 years leading the college to 3 victories in the Punjab University College tournament. It was here that Ajit shifted from Full Back to Center Half, his real position. He was named the Captain of Punjab University Hockey team in 1966, and represented Indian Universities' Hockey team in 1968. International Hockey Ajit Pal Singh made his debut in International Hockey with a tournament played at Bombay in 1960. He was selected in the Indian Hockey team that visited Japan in 1966, and participated in the Pre-Olympic tournament held in London the next year. Further, he played in the Olympic Games Mexico 1968 and delivered a brilliant performance although the Indian Hockey squad stood at 3rd spot at the event. Ajit played for the Indian Hockey team at Bangkok Asian Games 1970, and was named the Captain of the Indian squad that played at Post Shuan Tournament held at Singapore in 1971, and Tehran Asian Games 1974. The Indian team managed to grab a Silver Medal at both the events. He was a part of the Indian squad at Munich Olympic Games 1972, where the team finished at 3rd spot getting a Bronze Medal. He led the Indian Hockey team to World Cup Hockey tournament held at Kuala Lumpur in 1975 leading the team to win the tournament and also at Montreal Olympic Games 1976 where the Indian team fared really bad and finished at the 7th spot. After this debacle, Ajit Pal Singh retired from International Hockey, although he participated in his last International Hockey event in 1980 at Champions Trophy Tournament, Karachi. Even after his retirement from International Hockey, Ajit continued to play in Domestic Hockey Circuit for Border Security Force (B.S.F.) team. Awards As an honour to his outstanding contribution to Indian Hockey, Ajit Pal Singh was conferred upon the Arjuna Award in 1970. Further, he was also bestowed upon the Padma Shri award in 1992.

Inaugurated in 1950, the highway starts at the junction of the Moscow Ring Road and Varshavskoye Shosse and travels south-west, immediately bypassing the cities of Tula, Oryol, Kursk and Belgorod before terminating at the border with Ukraine. West of the border at Hoptivka, the road continues through Kharkov and Zaporizhia to Simferopol and Yalta as the Ukrainian M20 and M18. Prior to the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russian Federation, it was used by Russian summer vacationers who travel to the Black Sea resorts of Crimea; that journey may now be made by the M4 and A290 instead.

Schloss Hohenheim is a manor estate in Stuttgart, eponymous of the Hohenheim city district. The original castle was a fief of the County of W√ºrttemberg, recorded for the 12th century. The estate fell into the possession of Charles Eugene, Duke of W√ºrttemberg in 1768, who had it re-built as a Rococo style manor with extensive gardens and residential palace for his future wife, Franziska von Hohenheim. The estate was the main ducal residence during 1772-1797, when it fell to the city of Stuttgart. An Agricultural Educational Testing and Model Institution was housed here in 1818, and the estate remains in use by the Horticulture and Agriculture Departments of the University of Hohenheim. History The first mention of Hohenheim is in a donation of some land to Hirsau Abbey by Egilof von Hohenheim. The castle was sold by the von Hohenheim family in 1406, and passed to the Esslingen hospital in 1432. In 1676, it was bought by Immanuel von Garb, after whom it was known as Garbenhof for some time. As von Garb's granddaughter died without heirs in 1768, the estate fell into the possession of Charles Eugene, Duke of W√ºrttemberg.Beschreibung der land- und forstwirthschaftlichen Akademie Hohenheim (1863), 1f. Charles Eugene made Hohenheim his main residence in 1772 and made major changes to the estate, turning it into a full sized Rococo manor. The gardens around the castle were also planned at this time. They featured pillars depicting the Roman gods Jupiter (god) and a playhouse now used as a museum by the University of Hohenheim. The gardens continued to be maintained and many exotic plants were added. The Duke commissioned an extensive residential palace to be built on the grounds of Hohenheim in 1782 until construction halted in 1793 due to the Duke's death at Hohenheim. His brother, Duke Frederick II Eugene died in Hohenheim in 1797, afer which the estate land was rented out to tenants and the manor and gardens placed under the administration of the city of Stuttgart, falling into gradual decline. It was used as a military hospital in 1814.Beschreibung der land- und forstwirthschaftlichen Akademie Hohenheim (1863), 2f. In 1818, King Wilhelm I of W√ºrttemberg and his wife Catherine founded the Agricultural Educational Testing and Model Institution, which was housed in a separate building on the castle and the Paracelsus School was housed in the east wing much later. During World War II, a wing of the castle was destroyed, but was rebuilt (at least the exterior of the wing). In the 1970s, the castle was restored and modernized and the rococo plaster removed. The 1990s saw the return of this plaster to lock once again. Current use Today, the University of Hohenheim uses large portions of the castle grounds. The Horticulture and Agriculture Departments of the University have been found on the castle grounds since 1818. The Kavaliersbau , the University of Hohenheim established a canteen in 1918 that was converted into a restaurant in 1958.

The abbey was founded between 1202 and 1210 by the Blessed Hroznata, whose sister Vyslava was first abbess, and settled by nuns from Doksany Abbey. The new foundation soon acquired wealth and influence, to the envy of the surrounding lordships and territories. In 1421, during the Hussite Wars the nunnery was occupied and destroyed by a Hussite army under Jan ≈Ωi≈æka. During the Thirty Years' War, in 1618, the nunnery was again occupied and plundered. Between 1737 and 1756 the abbey was extensively rebuilt to Baroque designs by Jakub Auguston. Dissolution On 21 January 1782 however it was dissolved under the rationalist reforms of the Emperor Joseph II. The lands and buildings were bought in 1822 by the Prince of Thurn und Taxis Salesian Sisters Fresco above the main stairs. Nuns on the way up to the God. In 1878 part of the premises were leased to the Order of the Visitation of Holy Mary, also known as the Visitandines or Salesian Sisters, for refugees of their Order from Moselweiss near Koblenz in Germany. They established a community and a girls' school here, which rapidly became well-known, particularly for the study of languages. After World War I a group of sisters returned to Germany and set up a community in Marchtal Abbey. At the beginning of World War II the school was closed and instead the sisters took over the running of a home for elderly women which was established in part of the premises. All German sisters were obliged to leave the abbey and the country in 1945 after the end of World War II, leaving about 30 Czech sisters to run the home. Post-war All occupants of the abbey were evicted in 1950, when the abbey was requisitioned as accommodation for the Czech army (the protest singer Karel Kryl did part of his military service here in the 1960s) until 1975 when the army left, leaving an estimated 10 million crowns' worth of damage for which compensation has never been received. The buildings have stood empty ever since. After some years under the control of government agencies, in 1991 ownership of the buildings was divided between the town of Chotƒõ≈°ov and the Visitandine nuns at Chlumec, whose share has since also passed to the town. The abandoned buildings are in part in a state approaching the derelict and are threatened with collapse, despite their architectural and historical value and the great efforts of the local community to save them.

Its position allows dry continental air from Eurasia to meet wetter air from the Atlantic Ocean, which causes the weather to be highly variable, often changing many times during the day. It is defined as a temperate oceanic climate, or Cfb on the K√∂ppen climate classification system. It is significantly warmer than other regions on the same latitude, due to the warmth provided by the Gulf Stream. Temperatures do not often switch between great extremes, with warm summers and mild winters. Temperature The British Isles undergo very small temperature variations. This is due to its proximity to the Atlantic, which acts as a temperature buffer, warming the Isles in winter and cooling them in summer. Coastal areas tend to be more temperate than inland areas, as the influence of the ocean is less acute. Valleys can be especially cold, as cool air collects in them during the winter. July is usually the warmest month, with the highest temperatures being found closest to Continental Europe, in south-east England. Sunshine and cloud A typical North Atlantic low-pressure area moving across the British Isles The sunniest times are the months of May and June, whereas December has the least sunshine. The clearest skies in the British Isles occur over the south of England, due to the winds from the continent. Equally, mountainous areas, especially in the North-west receive barely any sunshine, sometimes less than 1000 hours a year. In winter on north-south valleys there are sometimes only a few hours of sunshine in a day. Radiation fog may develop over inland areas of Great Britain and can persist for hours or even days in the winter and can pose a major hazard for drivers and aircraft. Fog is more common inland and on higher altitudes; mainly during winter and during the morning at times of high pressure. On occasions blocking anticyclones (high pressure systems) may move over the British Isles, which can persist for weeks or even months. The subsided, dry air often results in clear skies and few clouds, bringing frosty nights in winter and hot days in the summer, when some coastal areas can achieve almost maximum possible sunshine for periods of weeks. Precipitation Great Britain in the winter of 2009-2010 Rainfall varies across the Isles, with a general trend to more rain as you go west and in higher elevations. December and January are usually the wettest months. The mountain ranges are the wettest areas in the U.K. These are some of the wettest locations in Britain. Most rainfall comes from North Atlantic depressions occur throughout the year and are particularly frequent and intense in the autumn and winter. They can on occasions bring prolonged periods of heavy rain, and flooding is quite common. Snow can occur during winter months, most frequently occurring during January and February. Hail is relatively common, and is most common during the summer months. Each of the United Kingdom's 50 strongest hailstorms on record since 1650 have occurred between the months of May and September.https://www.weatheronline.co.uk/reports/wxfacts/Hailstorms-in- Britain.htm Winds The prevailing winds over the British Isles are from the south-west, and winds are strongest on coasts that face the Atlantic. Generally, the coast tends to be windier than inland areas; and the west tends to be windier than the east. Gales -- which are defined as winds with speeds of -- are strongly associated with the passage of deep depressions across the area. The Hebrides experience on average 35 days of gale a year (a day where there are gale-force winds). Areas of high elevation tend to have higher wind speeds than low elevations. Severe weather The British Isles do not experience extreme weather regularly. There have been several occasions where extreme weather events have occurred. In the winter of 1982, for a few days parts of central and southern England experienced temperatures lower than central Europe and Moscow. In contrast, the summers of 1975 and 1976 experienced temperatures as high as . It was so dry the country suffered drought and water shortages. Extended periods of extreme weather, such as the drought of 1975-1976 and the very cold winters of 1946-1947, 1962-1963, 1978-79, 1981-1982 and 2009-2010, are often caused by blocking anti-cyclones which can persist several days or even weeks. In winter they can bring long periods of cold dry weather and in summer long periods of hot dry weather. Cyclones Hurricane Katia's path Tropical cyclones themselves do not affect the British Isles due to the cold temperature of the surrounding ocean. Any tropical cyclone that comes near the Isles has said to have undergone a process called extratropical transition. The Isles do experience these extratropical cyclones, the Great Storm of 1987 was a deep depression which formed in the Bay of Biscay, which also contained the remnants of Hurricane Floyd. Hurricane Lili of 1996 and Hurricane Gordon of 2006 both were strong extratropical cyclones with tropical storm-force winds, which caused transport closures, power-cuts and flooding. In 2011, the remnants of Hurricane Katia of 2011 brought near hurricane-force winds to Scotland, with sustained winds reaching while centred over the Isle of Lewis. In 2017, Hurricane Ophelia brought severe storms to Ireland, and carried Saharan dust and smoke from wildfires in Portugal into the atmosphere over the United Kingdom, creating red and orange skies across the country. Thunderstorms Thunderstorms are most common in London, the South-East, East of England, and the East Midlands, and least common in the north-west. Greater London, Kent, Sussex, Essex, Hertfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Norfolk are the regions with the most thunderstorms during the year. The South West and the West Midlands also gets storms but usually less severe. Occasionally, thunderstorms can be severe and produce large hailstones as seen in Ottery St Mary, Devon in October 2008, where drifts reached . Climate change Estimates produced by the Met Office predict average annual temperature to increase by 2 ¬∞C (4 ¬∞F) and the warmest summer day to increase by 3 ¬∞C (6 ¬∞F) by the 2050s. Average winter rainfall is also likely to increase and most areas will see a slight decrease in annual rainfall. Recent events Recently the British Isles have undergone some record breaking events. In 2004-2006, a partial drought caused fires to break out throughout the south of Great Britain, and water restrictions were introduced in some areas. The drought problems were solved due to the unusually wet period between October 2006 and July 2007, which had higher than average rainfall. The year 2006 was an unusually warm one. Although the year started off cool, from April the weather stayed warmer than average.

The central library of the town, the Stadtbibliothek Stuttgart was situated in this building from 1965 until 2011. Since 2018 the City Museum of Stuttgart is situated in Wilhelm Palais.  History  The Wilhelmspalais was built from 1834 to 1840 by Giovanni Salucci, the court architect of King Wilhelm I of W√ºrttemberg in the Classical style. The king wanted to use it as a residence for his two eldest daughters, the Princesses Marie and Sophie. King Whilhelm also hired Ludwig von Zanth to design the interior of the palace. The grandnephew of Wilhelm II, also named Wilhelm, moved into the Wilhelmpalais until Wilhelm II abdicated on 30 November 1918. On 9 November 1918, revolutionaries stormed the castle. The property passed into the ownership if the city of Stuttgart upon the abdication of Wilhelm II on 30 November 1918. It became a museum in 1929 that featured exhibitions.

The park memorial plate lists the names of men of various ethnic groups in North Borneo and from various islands in the Sulu Archipelago including the main resistance leader Albert Kwok and those who assisted or died in Labuan Military Prison. The park was built exactly on the site where the massacre took place and where the victims were initially buried. It is located in Kg. Peringatan Petagas in the district of Putatan in Sabah, Malaysia.  History = Background and event leading to the establishment of resistance movement  With the persistent harsh rule during the occupation of northern Borneo by the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA), a Kuching- born Chinese doctor named Albert Kwok founded more than 300 members to form the resistance movement, after he moved to Jesselton on 15 May 1941. Already facing the limited supply of weapons, the resistance movement was forced to launch the revolt ahead of schedule on 9 October 1943 as the Japanese decree to seize any opposition towards their administration became imminent. On the eve of the National Day of the Republic of China on 10 October, the attack was subsequently launched at Jesselton resulting in more than 50 Japanese casualties, with the majority dying from attacks by the parang, bujak and kris. Furious with the uprising by the local communities, Japanese reinforcement troops arrived in North Borneo from Kuching and began to launch a systematic retaliation on the civilian population. After threatening that more civilians were to be executed if the leaders of the uprising did not turn themselves in, Kwok with several movement leaders surrendered on 19 December 1944. They were initially imprisoned in Batu Tiga Prison before being executed at the Petagas War Memorial site on 21 January 1944 along with 175 others, who for the most part had nothing to do with the uprising.  Massacre of civilians and resistance movement members  In the early morning of 21 January 1944, Kwok and the 175 men from Batu Tiga Prison were dispatched on a North Borneo Railway train. The train arrived from Jesselton and stopped at 5.30 in the morning at an open track near Petagas. Two large pits had been dug there the day before and rain water had already filled the holes. The movement leaders including Kwok, Charles Peter, Tsen Tsau Kong, Kong Tze Phui and Li Tet Phui had to stand in a row and to lean forward. Four Japanese officers and the son of a Japanese businessman (killed during the uprising) were ordered to behead the five prisoners with katana. The remaining 170 prisoners had to kneel in front of the pits and were killed by either shots from two machine guns, ten small firearms or with bayonets. Eyewitnesses near the execution site reported that the screams of the men were heard throughout the day and the following night in Petagas. Even before the massacre in Petagas, 96 inmates comprising guerrillas members and men suspected of supporting the guerrillas had been tortured and killed at the Batu Tiga Prison. Another 131 men were transferred to the Labuan Military Prison immediately after the forced labour massacre. Only seven survived and the others died either from malnutrition, by torture or were executed.  Establishment of the memorial site  Monument plate with the description of park opening history. On 21 January 1946, the Chinese War Victims Relief Association (CWVRA) held a memorial service at the execution site as a second anniversary of the massacre. The park grounds and marble memorial were built in 1948 at the behest of the West Coast Memorial Fund Residential Committee (WCMFRC). At the same time, it was decided that the site of the massacre and its burial sites should be a permanent place of remembrance for all North Borneo's victims in World War II. The inauguration of the memorial took place on the fourth anniversary of the massacre on 21 January 1948. In 1949, the remains of the men who were murdered by the Japanese military police (kenpeitai) and interred in Labuan were reburied at Petagas. The memorial continued to play an important role in North Borneo's historical consciousness even until the foundation of Malaysia in 1963 through the first Chief Minister Fuad Stephens and the Head of State Mustapha Harun, whose personal histories were closely linked with the resistance movement. Jules Stephens as one of the members of the revolt serving under the North Borneo Volunteer Force (NBVF), was the father of Donald Stephens, while Mustapha was a member of the movement itself. In 1979, the memorial was renovated by the Kota Kinabalu City Government with the financial support of the State Government and extended with a parking space and a public toilet. The wooden monument was replaced with a marble stone. During the renovations, several stone clay jars with human remains were discovered in the burial ground. These turned out to be the ex-prisoners from the Labuan military prison which had been re-buried in Petagas. Since the opening of the Petagas War Memorial site, an annual memorial service has been held on 21 January with the participation of high-ranking state politicians, families of the victims and the general population. At the 1998 service, a representative of the Japanese government and the Japanese consul in Kota Kinabalu attended the ceremony for the first time. On 21 January 2018, the annual commemoration included another eight civilians who were not part of the Albert Kwok group. Their names (Lothar Wong Manjaji, Vitalianus Joseph Lim @ Ubing, Simon Thien, Bung Ah Tee @ Stephen Pan Tet Liong, Paul Chong Pin Sin, Paul Lee Fook Onn @ Paul Lee Onn, Lim Hock Beng and Mohinder Singh a/l Harnam Singh Kalsi), were added onto a new plaque at the main monument. Following the discovery of the War Crime Document WO235/884 of the 1946 Trial Proceedings (held in Changi Singapore), the families applied for and received an official acknowledgement from the Dewan Bandaraya Kota Kinabalu that between 12 June and early July 1945, a Japanese kempeitai had blacklisted the 8 civilians as detrimental elements supporting the allies and ordered them to be (unlawfully) killed. The original Document is held at the National Archives in the United Kingdom. A copy of that Document, certified by The National Archives is held at the Sabah Museum. As the eight men were not guerilla members from the Albert Kwok group, their families requested for a separate memorial wall to be constructed also at the Petagas War Memorial garden. After a positive meeting with the Sabah State Secretary, who supported the request, a site at the garden was identified for the memorial construction. The Sabah state government led by Deputy Chief Minister and State Tourism Minister Christina Liew also plans to convert the whole Memorial garden into a historical site and tourist attraction in the city of Kota Kinabalu. By early 2021, it is hoped that a memorial hall will have also been built at the site of the war memorial.  Description  Gates of the memorial park. Grass areas where the victims remains are buried. The memorial park is located near the Kota Kinabalu International Airport (Terminal 2) in the Putatan district, not far from the Putatan railway station. Surrounded by a white metal fence, the tree- lined terrain covers an area of 7,800 square metres. To the left of the main entrance, beside park benches, is an information board with an overview of the history of the memorial in Malay and English languages. Above the main entrance gate is an archway inscribed with the words \\"Petagas War Memorial\\" in Malay, Chinese and English. From there, an 80-metre pathway leads towards the monument, a structure covered on all four sides with separate 2 metre high metal plates. Three of the metal plates inform about the massacre and its historical background in Malay, Chinese and English languages, while the fourth metal plate is an epitaph and contains the names of the dead. Immediately in front of the memorial is a 10 x 5 m enclosed grass area where the remains of the dead are buried.  West side  The epitaph. A plate description in Malay language about the park history. The epitaph - the metal plate on the west side facing the cemetery - bears the words: { style=\\"width: 5em\\" style=\\"width:10em\\" In perpetual memory of those gallant men of all races who, loyal to the cause of freedom were murdered and buried at this place on 21st January 1944 and also those who met their death in the same cause at Labuan and were later buried here. } This is followed by a list of all men buried at Kota Kinabalu and Labuan. Since the majority of the dead were Chinese, Chinese characters dominate the epitaph.  North side  The metal plate on the north side begins with the title \\"Epitaph for the Kinabalu Guerilla Movement Martyrs\\" and a quotation from the Gospel of John: { style=\\"width: 5em\\" style=\\"width:50em\\" Greater Love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his country. (J.P.) }  East side  The metal plate on the east side contains information in Chinese.  South side  The south side corresponds in structure and content of the north side, in the Malay language.

Built on the eponymous W√ºrttemberg mountain in a spur of the Schurwald around above sea level, it is located in the current municipality of Rotenberg in Stuttgart, between Bad Cannstatt and Esslingen am Neckar. Between 1080 and 1819, three castles with this name existed in the area.  History = First castle  The first castle was constructed in 1080 and has been described as \\"fortification with three surrounding walls, several buildings including extensive stables, a courtyard and a stately manor.\\" The castle's chapel was consecrated on February 7, 1083. Conrad I, Count of W√ºrttemberg documented the castle on May 2, 1092, signing as a witness. This is the oldest document featuring the name \\"W√ºrttemberg.\\" From 1092 to 1495, the castle repeatedly served as the family seat of numerous counts of W√ºrttemberg. 1311 saw the first destruction of the castle by the forces of the neighboring Free imperial cities under Emperor Henry VII.  Second castle  Reconstruction of the castle began in 1311, although in smaller dimensions than the original castle. The second castle was burned down in 1519 when the forces of the Swabian League under the command of William IV, Duke of Bavaria occupied most of W√ºrttemberg.  Third castle  Wirtemberg, 1624: Birthplace of House W√ºrttemberg After the destruction of 1519, Duke Ulrich rebuilt the castle for the third and last time. Wirtemberg Castle was eventually dismantled in 1819 during the reign of William I after several hundreds years of neglect it had fallen into ruins.  Grave chapel  From 1820 to 1824, Wilhelm I. had the W√ºrttemberg Mausoleum erected for his deceased wife Katharina at the site of the dismantled third castle. Designed by Giovanni Salucci in neoclassical style it has been open to the public since 1907.  Etymology  The spelling of the castle's name has changed numerous times over the centuries. Previous names include Wirdeberch, Werdenberc, and Wirtinsberk. \\"W√ºrttemberg\\" became official after the establishment of the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg under Napoleon. The humorous wordplay \\"Wirt am Berg\\" has been in common use to this day.

Before coming to Singapore, she taught Buddhism and meditation in countries like United States, Europe and Hong Kong. She taught in Singapore for over a year, teaching in schools as well as at different Buddhist societies. She also published several books such as Working with Anger, Open Heart, Clear Mind, Buddhism for Beginners et cetera. In 1988, the group decided to organise as a Buddhist society under the name \\"Amitabha Buddhist Centre\\", and leased a small house at Butterfly Avenue for its activities.

Visits from Tulkus A tulku is a Tibetan Buddhist lama who has consciously decided to be reborn, often many times, in order to continue his or her religious pursuits. The most famous example is the lineage of the Dalai Lamas. On 26 May 1991, Tulku Tenzin √ñsel Rinpoche, a 6-year old Spanish boy, visited Singapore to join members of Amitabha Buddhist Centre for Vesak celebrations. When he was seven months old, this boy had appeared in a dream of a close disciple of Lama Yeshe. The disciple sought him out, and the boy was later officially confirmed as the reincarnation of Lama Yeshe by the Dalai Lama. The boy's story is the subject of Reincarnation: The Boy Lama by Vicki Mackenzie. On 16 April 2007, 4-year old Tulku Tenzin Phuntsok Rinpoche, dubbed the \\"Little Lama\\" by devotees, visited Singapore and Amitabha Buddhist Centre. More than 10,000 people from all walks of life, including some Christians and Hindus, sought blessings from Phuntsok Rinpoche. He is the reincarnation of Geshe Lama Konchog, confirmed by the Dalai Lama in December 2005.Newsletter of Amitabha Buddhist Centre, May/June 2007.

Early life Want was born at the Glebe, Sydney, the fourth son of nine children of Randolph John Want, a solicitor, and his wife, Hariette, n√©e Lister. Want was educated at Rev. W. H. Savigny's Collegiate School, Cooks River, and reportedly in Caen, Normandy, France, where he learned to speak fluent French. Want worked in his father's office but soon became bored with the legal practice, went on the land in Queensland, and afterward worked in a mine at Lithgow. Want then returned to Sydney and read in the chambers of Sir Frederick Darley. Want was called to the bar on 13 November 1869 and established a large practice as a barrister. He also engaged in many profitable commercial ventures, some of a \\"suspicious character\\". The Mignonette Want was a keen yachtsman, his father had been a founding member of the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron in 1862, and in 1883 Want travelled to England to look for a new vessel. He purchased the Mignonette at Cowes, a 19.43 net tonnage, 52 foot cruiser built in 1867. The yacht could only reasonably be transported to Australia by sailing her there but she was a small vessel and the prospect of a 15,000 mile voyage hampered Want's initial attempts to find a suitable crew. However, she finally set sail for Sydney from Southampton on 19 May 1884 with a crew of four: Tom Dudley, the captain; Edwin Stephens; Edmund Brooks; and Richard Parker, the cabin boy. Parker was aged 17 and an inexperienced seaman. On 5 July, the yacht was running before a gale at 27¬∞10' south, 9¬∞50' west, around 1,600 miles northwest of the Cape of Good Hope. Though the weather was by no means extreme and the vessel was not in any difficulties, a wave struck the yacht and washed away the lee bulwarks. Dudley instantly realised that the yacht was doomed and ordered the single 13-foot lifeboat to be lowered. The Mignonette sank within five minutes of being struck and the crew abandoned ship for the lifeboat, only managing to salvage vital navigational instruments along with two tins of turnips and no fresh water. There have been various theories about the structural inadequacies of the yacht that led to such a catastrophic failure in routine weather. The crew were adrift for 24 days and resorted to cannibalism, with Parker being killed and eaten and Dudley and Stephens later prosecuted in England in a landmark case. Political career=Lower house Want was a candidate for the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Gundagai at the 1884 by-election, but was unsuccessful. Want was successful at the 1885 election, His parliamentary skills were recognised and he became Attorney- General in the first ministry of George Dibbs (October to December 1885) and in the Patrick Jennings ministry (February 1886 to January 1887). He was a staunch free-trader and with the emergence of political parties in 1887 could not continue to work with Dibbs and Jennings who had formed the Protectionist Party, but neither could he work under Henry Parkes who led the Free Trade Party. Want stood as an independent free trade candidate at the 1887 election where he was re-elected. For a while he formed a small corner party which he facetiously referred to as \\"the home for lost dogs\\". In 1889 he moved a motion for the assembly to adjourn adjournment as a result of the appointment of Mr William Meeke Fehon as one of the Railway Commissioners and the motion was carried 37 to 23. The then premier, Henry Parkes, treated as a vote of no confidence and resigned. Want was sent for by the governor but declined the task of forming a ministry, with the Governor, Lord Carrington accepting his recommendation to call for George Dibbs to form his second ministry. Dibbs never commanded a majority on the floor of the Assembly and almost immediately parliament was dissolved and an election called. For the resulting election Want was a candidate for Paddington, standing as a member of the Free Trade Party, despite his views on Parkes and his role in moving for the adjournment of the house, and was the first elected of four members. For the 1891 election Want reverted to standing as an independent free trade candidate and was the second elected of four members. He was not anxious for office and temporarily retired from politics in 1891. Want was appointed a Queen's Counsel in 1887, and had an immense practice particularly in jury trials, both civil (nisi prius) and criminal cases. No other barrister of his period in Australia earned more in fees or had a greater reputation. Upper house Want was nominated to the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1894 and from 18 December 1894 until April 1889 (apart from 10 weeks in 1898) was attorney-general in the ministry of George Reid. Want returned to politics partly because he wanted to keep the free trade party together and partly because he had always been opposed to Federation, and could carry on the fight better in parliament. He believed in the pre-eminence of his own colony, New South Wales, and he feared that under any kind of union it would lose its position. How strongly he felt can be seen by a quotation from one of his speeches: \\"I would rather see almost anything than see this hydra-headed monster called federation basking in its constitutional beastliness--for that is what it is--in this bright and sunny land. ... I was the first public man to assert my intention of opposing to the bitter end any system of federation, because there can be none which would not involve the surrender of our independence and liberty\\". Want was still a member of Reid's ministry when Reid made his famous Yes-No speech on 28 March 1898, and could not understand how his leader could conclude without asking his hearers to vote against a measure which this very speech had shown to be \\"rotten, weak, and unfair\\". He resigned from the ministry a few days later, but joined it again in June after the defeat of the first referendum. Want left Australia on a visit to England in December 1898 and resigned from the ministry in the following April. Later life At the second referendum held in June 1899, New South Wales voted in favour of federation. After its achievement Want continued to fight for the rights of his state, but was never in office again. He died of appendicitis on 22 November 1905. Personality and assessment Want was over six feet (180 cm) in height, had a rugged jaw and flashing eyes. He was \\"flamboyant and ostentatious, usually going by the name of \\"Jack\\" or \\"Jimmy\\" It was said of him that he was \\"as honest and honourable as he was bluff and unconventional, a generous foeman and a true friend\\". In politics he found it impossible to be a party man, and though he was capable as an administrator he had little ambition. Want could have been premier on one occasion and chief justice on another, but desired neither position. He felt strongly only on the question of federation. He was, however, a great advocate unequalled in his presentation of his evidence to the jury, taking it into his confidence with an appealing frankness, emphasizing the strong points of his case, and gently sliding over its weaknesses. He used his wide knowledge of human nature with great effectiveness both in his addresses to the jury and in cross-examination, in which he was a master. In arguing before the full court he could adapt his methods to his audience, and though like so many great advocates not really a great lawyer his knowledge was sufficient for his purposes. He was married twice and left a widow, there were no children.

He played professionally for three clubs, Coventry City, Tottenham Hotspur and Birmingham City. He is possibly best remembered for the incident in the 1956 FA Cup Final when Manchester City's goalkeeper Bert Trautmann broke a bone in his neck when diving at Murphy's feet. Life and career Murphy was born in West Hartlepool, County Durham, and moved to Coventry, Warwickshire, with his family when he was four years old. He was with both Coventry City and Birmingham as an amateur footballer before his career was interrupted by the Second World War. He turned professional with Coventry City in May 1946 at the age of 24, making over 100 appearances and scoring at a rate of a goal every three games. Manager Arthur Rowe took him to Tottenham Hotspur in June 1950 for a fee of ¬£18,500. He played as an inside forward, deputising for the injured Les Bennett in the \\"push and run\\" side that won the League championship in 1950‚Äì51. On Bennett's return to fitness, Murphy found himself being played out of position on the left wing, so when Birmingham City bid ¬£20,000 for him in January 1952 he was willing enough to drop down a division to return to the Midlands. When Tommy Briggs left Birmingham later that year, Murphy took up a more attacking role in the team. He was an energetic player with a powerful left-foot shot who was willing to shoot from any distance, and was Birmingham's leading scorer three times, in the 1952‚Äì53, 1954‚Äì55 and 1957‚Äì58 seasons. He retired from playing in 1959 to coach Birmingham's youth team, but was called out of retirement for the last seven games of the season and scored four goals which contributed to the club avoiding relegation to the Second Division. Murphy scored five goals in Birmingham's run to the 1956 FA Cup Final, in which they lost 3‚Äì1 to the Don Revie-inspired Manchester City. This match is best remembered for the incident where Manchester City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann was injured when he dived at Murphy's feet to collect the ball, but played on in considerable pain for the last 15 minutes of the match without realising he had broken one of the vertebrae in his neck. The following season Murphy scored another four goals in Birmingham's FA Cup run, which ended this time in semifinal defeat to Manchester United's Busby Babes. He was also a pioneer of European competition. He played in Birmingham's first match in the 1955‚Äì58 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, when they became the first English club side to participate in Europe, and finished that campaign as the competition's joint leading scorer. He also played in the second leg of the 1960 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, which was the first appearance by an English club side in a European final. Birmingham lost 4‚Äì1 to Barcelona. Over his professional career he scored 158 goals in nearly 400 League appearances. For Birmingham his record was 127 goals in 278 games in all competitions, which ranks him third , behind Joe Bradford and Trevor Francis, in their all-time scoring charts. Murphy died in Coventry in 1975 at the age of 53.

It is famous for its student body of advanced kabbalists -- many of them roshei yeshiva and Torah scholars -- as well as beginning and intermediate scholars who study both the revealed and concealed Torah. Name The name of the yeshiva was taken from the Torah passage in which Jacob dreams of a ladder stretching from earth to heaven. After he awakens from his dream, Jacob exclaims, \\"This is none other than the House of God, and this is the Gate of Heaven (Shaar Hashamayim)!\\" (Genesis 28:19). Origins Rabbi Chaim Yehuda Leib Auerbach, founder and rosh yeshiva. The impetus to found Shaar Hashamayim Yeshiva came from a dream experienced by two noteworthy Jerusalem rabbis on the same night in 1906. Rabbi Chaim Yehuda Leib Auerbach, author of Chacham Lev, awoke one night from a strange dream and went back to sleep, only to be awakened again after the dream repeated itself. He got dressed and set out for the home of Rabbi Shimon Horowitz, a kabbalah scholar and author of Shem MiShimon and Kol Mevaser, to discuss the dream with him. As he walked, he saw someone approaching him in the night and was surprised that it was none other than Horowitz, who was coming to see him about the dream he had just dreamed. It turned out that they had dreamed the same dream. They had each envisioned an honorable Jew, his face shining with a supernatural light, who had demanded to know why people weren't studying his teachings. \\"My Torah has the power to bring the Divine Presence back from its exile,\\" the man told them. The two realized that the man in the dream was the Arizal, the sixteenth-century mystic of Safed, who was known to have regretted the fact that few Jewish men who studied the Torah also studied Kabbalah, in particular the Ashkenazi Jews of Jerusalem. At that time, the only place where the Arizal's teachings were studied was the Beit El Synagogue in Jerusalem. On the spot, Auerbach and Horowitz decided to open a yeshiva for the study of the Arizal's kabbalah and share the responsibilities as joint roshei yeshiva. The yeshiva opened shortly afterwards in the Old City of Jerusalem, with accommodations for a Talmud Torah, a yeshiva ketana, a yeshiva gedola, and a kollel for married students. Curriculum In 1924, the yeshiva published a pamphlet describing its aims and approach as follows: > First, the study of the revealed Torah, as it is studied in all the holy > yeshivot, [including] Shas in depth and poskim. Second, the study of > kabbalah, mussar and inquiry. [This is] the only place in the world where > the Torah of kabbalah is studied in an orderly manner, progressing from > simple teachings to more difficult ones, taught by talmidei chachamim who > are qualified for the task. ‚Ä¶ > The yeshiva's intention is not to provide its students with a simple, > superficial understanding of the works of kabbalah, to afford a mere > glimpse, wherein lies the danger of stumbling ‚Äî as Chazal put it, \\"He > glimpsed and was injured.\\" Only extensive inquiry and in-depth study of all > the kabbalah works ensures full, rounded knowledge. This is what Yeshivas > Shaar HaShamayim and its branches aim to provide. Then as now, kabbalists who wish to study at the yeshiva must demonstrate extensive knowledge of the revealed Torah, and spend half the day in the yeshiva learning the revealed Torah. The yeshiva offers daily shiurim (classes) in Talmud, poskim, halakha and aggadah. Classes on the concealed Torah (i.e., kabbalah) are organized by level. The first level is introductory, with the study of the Arizal's Otzros Chaim. The second level studies the Arizal's lessons in Eitz Chaim in depth. The third level studies the kavannot (mystical concentrations) of the Rashash. Student body One of the first students in the new yeshiva was Rabbi Tzvi Pesach Frank, a dayan (rabbinical judge) on the Jerusalem beit din (rabbinical court) and future Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem. The yeshiva has produced a number of Torah scholars, Torah disseminators and rabbis. It has also published many works on kabbalah. Destruction and relocation The current home of the yeshiva on Rashi St. in the Mekor Baruch neighborhood of Jerusalem. Note the 13 windows under the roof line. Shaar Hashamayim Yeshiva operated at 1 Gal'ed Street in the Old City of Jerusalem from 1906 to 1948. The 1927 Jericho earthquake damaged the building. During the Israeli War of Independence, Haganah fighters used the yeshiva's roof to fire on the Jordanian army. When the Old City fell to the Jordanians, the yeshiva evacuated to Amatzia Street in the Katamon neighborhood. The Jordanians set fire to the Old City building, burning all the seforim (holy books) and furniture inside. After the liberation of the Old City by the Israeli army in 1967, the yeshiva tried to reclaim its property, without success. Shaar Hashamayim Yeshiva next moved to the Beit Yisrael neighborhood, occupying the building that now houses the shtieblekh. In 1958, the yeshiva moved to Rashbam Street in the Mekor Baruch neighborhood. When Rabbi Refoel Dovid Auerbach became the rosh yeshiva, he succeeded in establishing a permanent home for the yeshiva at 71 Rashi Street in 1992.Rossoff, Where Heaven Touches Earth, p. 403. The design for the uppermost story of the building features thirteen windows on the sides facing the street and the rear courtyard, totaling twenty-six (the gematria of YHWH, one of the names of God). (In recent years, a building addition on the top rear story covered over three of the thirteen windows there.) Leadership The first roshei yeshiva of Shaar Hashamayim Yeshiva were the founders, Rabbi Chaim Yehuda Leib Auerbach and Rabbi Shimon Horowitz. Auerbach chose to stay with the yeshiva even after his father, the Admor of Chernowitz-Chmielnik, died and his Hasidim asked Auerbach to take his father's place. He declined, leaving the position of Admor unfulfilled. Following Auerbach's death in 1954, his son, Rabbi Eliezer Auerbach, led the yeshiva for many years. After his death, another of Auerbach's sons, Rabbi Refoel Dovid Auerbach, assumed leadership. Subsequent roshei yeshiva were Rabbi Aharon Slotkin (who died in 1973), Rabbi Yechiel Fishel Eisenbach (who served from 1973 until his death in 2008), and the current roshei yeshiva, Rabbi Yaakov Meir Shechter and Rabbi Gamliel Rabinowitz. Auerbach's eldest son, Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, served as president of the yeshiva; after his death, his son, Rabbi Shmuel Auerbach, succeeded him. Rabbi Shlomo Zalman's nephew, Rabbi Yakov Schlaff, acts as yeshiva administrator. Public events Shaar HaShamayim Yeshiva invites the public to participate in special yeshiva events during the year. The most popular is the Thursday afternoon prayer service held during the weeks of Shovavim (the weeks coinciding with the Torah readings of Shemot, Va'eira, Bo, Beshalach, Yitro, and Mishpatim, and, in a Jewish leap year, Terumah and Tetzaveh). This service incorporates special kabbalistic tikkunim (rectifications). Other types of tikkunim and pidyonos (redemptions) are also held in the yeshiva, but without publicity. Shaar HaShamayim Yeshiva has increased public awareness of the yahrzeit of the Arizal on 5 Av, and reintroduced the custom of visiting his gravesite in Safed on that day.

Founded in 1970 to educate baalot teshuva (female returnees to Orthodox Judaism) in the why and how of living an Orthodox Jewish life, Neve has approximately 35,000 alumni. Its campus in the Har Nof neighborhood of Jerusalem is also home to 11 schools and seminaries for post-high school, undergraduate, and graduate students from religious backgrounds.  History  Neve was founded in 1970 by Rabbi Dovid Refson, the British-born alumnus of the Gateshead Yeshiva and Yeshivas Knesses Chizkiyahu. After his marriage, he entered the kollel at the Harry Fischel Institute in Jerusalem and began delivering shiurim to American students. Deciding to open his own yeshiva, he placed an advertisement in The Jerusalem Post and was surprised when three young women showed up. \\"I thought yeshivah meant for boys, but apparently, in some places, yeshivah can mean a girls' school as well\\", he said. The staff \\"adapted\\" to the new reality, and Neve was born. Soon after, Rabbi Moshe Chalkowski came on board as principal. Students began arriving at the school on the recommendation of Rabbi Shlomo Freifeld, Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach, and the Chabad movement. The student body was older than Refson expected; while he was only 24 years old at the time, Neve's first students were in their late twenties and early thirties; some were as much as ten years his senior. In its early years, Neve was considered an unofficial sister school to the Ohr Somayach yeshiva for baal teshuva men in Jerusalem. First located in the Bayit Vegan neighborhood of Jerusalem, Neve expanded in the 1970s with a Hebrew division, a preparatory school, and the one-year Shalhevet program. In the 1980s, Neve added a French division and the Machon Devorah seminary. The latter seminary has since been joined on campus by other seminaries designed for post-high-school women from religious backgrounds (see list below). According to Refson, the idea of adding seminaries to the baalot teshuvah campus was meant to augment the girls' experience of Judaism, \\"creating a culture where kashrus, Shabbos and tzniyus are taken for granted\\".  Curriculum  Neve offers courses for beginner through advanced levels. From the start, instructors focused on the practical applications of Jewish law. Subjects include kashrut, the laws of family purity, and the laws of Shabbat and Jewish holidays. The curriculum also includes Tanakh and Jewish literature, aside from Talmud.  Student body  The English-speaking student body at Neve hails from the United States, Canada, Great Britain, South Africa, and Australia. In 2014, the school maintained a student body of 900 women. As of 2019, the average age of students is post-graduate; many obtained professional qualifications before coming to study here. As of 2019, Neve has approximately 35,000 alumni. The college is also a drop-in site for North American and South American kiruv groups, and summer visits by college students, Birthright groups, and visiting professionals.  Campus  Neve acquired its campus in Har Nof with significant funding from the Committee for Aid and Development Abroad chaired by United States Senator Daniel Inouye. The main building and two dormitories opened in 1987. As of 2016, the campus includes 12 academic buildings and eight dormitories, plus an auditorium, amphitheater, and synagogue.

Antam (or Antim) means \\"final\\", while sanskar means \\"rite\\". In Sikhism, death is considered a natural process and God's will or Hukam. To a Sikh, birth and death are closely associated, because they are both part of the cycle of human life of \\"coming and going\\" ( ‡®Ü‡®µ‡®£‡©Å ‡®ú‡®æ‡®£‡®æ, Aaavan Jaanaa) which is seen as transient stage towards Liberation ( ‡®Æ‡©ã‡®ñ‡©Å ‡®¶‡©Å‡®Ü‡®∞‡©Å, Mokh Du-aar), complete unity with God. Sikhs thus believe in reincarnation. The soul itself is not subject to death. Death is only the progression of the soul on its journey from God, through the created universe and back to God again. In life, a Sikh tries always to constantly remember death so that he or she may be sufficiently prayerful, detached and righteous to break the cycle of birth and death and return to God.  Sikh practices around death  Cremation is the preferred method of disposal, although if it is not possible any other methods such as burial or submergence at sea are acceptable. As there is no grave a memorial to the dead or gravestone, etc. is discouraged, because the body is considered to be only the shell, the person's soul was their real essence.  Before death  At a Sikh's death-bed, relatives and friends should read Sukhmani Sahib, the Psalm of Peace, composed by the fifth Guru Arjan Dev, or simply recite \\"Waheguru\\" to console themselves and the dying person. When a death occurs, they should exclaim \\"Waheguru, Waheguru, Waheguru\\" (the Wonderful Lord). If the death occurs in a hospital, the body is taken to the funeral parlor or home before the funeral. In preparation for cremation (usually the day before or day of the cremation), the body is first washed while those present recite the Gurmantar Waheguru or Mool Mantar. Then the body is lovingly dressed with clean clothes complete with the Five Ks (in case of baptized Sikhs).  The day of the cremation  On the day of the cremation, the body is taken to the Gurdwara or home where Shabads (hymns) from the Guru Granth Sahib, the Sikh Scriptures, are recited by the congregation, which induce feeling of consolation and courage. Kirtan may also be performed by Ragis while the relatives of the deceased recite \\"Waheguru\\". This service normally takes from 30 to 60 minutes. At the conclusion of the service, an Ardas is said before the body is taken to the cremation site. At the point of cremation, a few Shabads are sung and final speeches are made about the deceased person. Then the Kirtan Sohila (night time prayer) is recited and finally Ardas called the \\"Antim Ardas\\" (\\"Final Prayer\\") is offered. The eldest son or a close relative generally starts the cremation process ‚Äì by lighting the fire or pressing the button for the burning to begin. This service usually lasts about 30 to 60 minutes. The ashes are later collected and immersed in a body of water. Sikhs do not erect monuments over the remains of the dead. After the cremation ceremony, there may be another service at the Gurdwara, the Sikh place of worship, called the Sahaj Paath Bhog Ceremony.  Sahaj Paath Bhog Ceremony  After the death of a Sikh, the family of the deceased may undertake a non- continuous reading of the entire Sri Guru Granth Sahib (Sahaj Paath). This reading (Paath) is timed to conclude within ten days of the death of the person. The reading may be undertaken at home or in the Gurdwara and usually takes place on the day of the cremation. The conclusion of this ceremony called the Bhog Ceremony marks the end of the mourning period. Generally, all the relatives and friends of the family gather together for the Bhog ceremony on the completion of the reading of Guru Granth Sahib. Musicians sing appropriate Shabad hymns, Saloks of the ninth Guru Tegh Bahadur are read, and Ramkali Saad, the Call of God, is recited. After the final prayer, a selected reading or Hukam is taken, and Karah Parshad is distributed to the congregation. Normally food from the Guru's kitchen, Langar, is also served.

Telephone numbers are defined by an open telephone numbering plan that assigns subscriber telephone numbers of six to eleven digits. In addition, other short codes are used for special services. The plan is organized by types of services, indicated by the first digit. Geographic landline numbers start with the digit 0, while mobile telephone numbers start with 3. Four types of emergency services use three-digit telephone numbers in the group 11X, including 112 for the Carabinieri. Other initial digits denote other services, such as toll-free numbers. The dialing procedures for callers mandate that the full telephone number is always dialed, including the area code, which is called prefix (prefisso in Italian). The country code for calling Italy from abroad is 39. For calling foreign destinations from Italy, the international call prefix is 00, as is standard in most European countries. The regulations for Italian telephone numbers prescribe no fixed rules for grouping the digits for printing or display. Nevertheless, various grouping schemes are commonly used and a telephone number is likely to be written or pronounced differently by different people. Commonly used formatting or punctuation characters include the space character, the dot, full stop, and the hyphen. Number format The minimum length of telephone numbers is three digits and the maximum is twelve. Landline service Landline numbers start with the digit 0 and are 6 to 11 digits long, although they are rarely shorter than 9. They are composed of a variable length prefix followed by a variable length subscriber number. Prefixes are assigned on a geographical basis, starting from the north of the country; for example: Rome has prefix \\"06\\", Milan has \\"02\\", Naples has \\"081\\", and Turin has \\"011\\". Mobile telephone service Mobile telephone numbers start with the digit 3 and are generally ten digits long. It is still possible, but rare, to find nine-digit numbers, which were the first to be assigned. The group of the first three digits of a mobile telephone number (prefix) identifies the mobile network operator that assigned the number, but since 2002, mobile number portability is possible and thus any number can end up being managed by any carrier. Some network operators allow the caller to insert additional digits for redirecting calls to voice mail. For example, dialing, \\"363397308986\\" might connect to the voice mail service of the telephone number \\"3397308986\\". The extra digits vary based on the network operator managing the service.  Emergency and service numbers  Emergency and service numbers start with the digit 1. Four emergency numbers are currently in use, but a process has been started to consolidate them with 112, previously assigned to the gendarmerie, already the unique emergency number in some areas. Calls to 112 are answered within seconds and in multiple languages. The complete list of emergency numbers is: * \\"112\\": Gendarmerie (Carabinieri) * \\"113\\": State Police (Polizia di Stato) * \\"114\\": Helpline for children, handled by \\"SOS Il Telefono Azzurro Onlus\\" * \\"115\\": National Fire Department (Vigili del Fuoco) * \\"118\\": Regional Emergency Medical Service Other service numbers are: * \\"10...\\": Carrier selection codes, to be prepended to the dialed number; * \\"116\\": Road help (ACI); * \\"116000\\": Hotline for missing children, handled by \\"SOS Il Telefono Azzurro Onlus\\"; * \\"117\\": Financial Gendarmerie (Guardia di Finanza); * \\"12xx\\": Directory services; ** \\"1240\\": Directory service provided by Italiaonline; * \\"15xx\\": Public utility services; ** \\"1515\\": Fire department (forestry), handled by Corpo Forestale dello Stato; ** \\"1525\\": Environmental emergencies; ** \\"1518\\": Road information, handled by CCISS; ** \\"1530\\": Maritime assistance and rescue, handled by Italian Navy Coast Guard; * \\"194...\\": Customer care services; * \\"19696\\": Helpline for children, handled by \\"SOS Il Telefono Azzurro Onlus\\";  Special-rate numbers  Special-rate numbers start with 8 and include toll-free numbers (called green numbers, numeri verdi in Italian, starting with \\"80...\\"), shared-rate numbers (\\"84...\\") and premium-rate services (\\"89...\\").  Other numbers  Numbers starting with 4 are used for network-specific phone services like voice mailbox and various information services; they can be free, non-premium or premium. Included in this category are, among others: * \\"40...\\": free operator internal services; * \\"455...\\": fundraising services for social purposes by non-profit agencies, organizations and associations and government; * \\"47...\\": mass call services; The digit 5 has been reserved for VoIP numbers. Finally 7 is used for internet services such as virtual fax numbers and dial up internet access (\\"70...\\").  Unassigned numbers  Numbers starting with the digits 2, 6 and 9 are currently unassigned and reserved for future purposes.  Historical number formats = Trunk code removal  In the past it was possible to omit the prefix when calling from a landline to another landline in the same area. The digit \\"0\\" was the trunk code and it had to be removed when calling from abroad. This changed in 1998, with a transition period lasting from 19 June to 31 December. The new dialing procedures require dialing the full number for all calls. The main advantage is the availability of millions of previously reserved phone numbers. The change was widely advertised with a campaign named \\"Fissa il prefisso\\" (\\"Attach the prefix\\"). It was originally intended to replace the leading 0 with 4 for landlines. This was scheduled for implementation commencing 29 December 2000, but never happened. Instead, 4 was assigned to identify network services. Example for calling the landline subscriber number xxxxxxxx in Rome: * xxxxxxxx: from within Rome, before 1998; * : from within Rome, after 1998; * : from outside Rome, both before and after 1998; * : from abroad, before 1998; * : from abroad, after 1998.  Mobile numbers prefix shortening  Until 2001 a leading \\"0\\" was part of any mobile phone number, but it has been removed. Example for calling the mobile phone number ': * : from within Italy, before 2001; * : from within Italy, after 2001; * : from abroad, both before and after 2001.  Other changes  Several other smaller changes occurred during the years: for example the prefix for toll free numbers changed from \\"167\\" to \\"800\\" in 1999.  Special relations with other countries = Campione d'Italia  The Italian municipality Campione d'Italia, an exclave within the Swiss canton of Ticino, uses the Swiss telephone network and is part of the Swiss numbering plan, with local numbers using the +41 91 numbering range, although some Italian numbers are in use by the municipal council, which use the same +39 031 numbering range as the town of Como.Comune di Campione d'Italia  San Marino  The Italian enclave San Marino has its own country code 378, but landline numbers can be reached using the Italian country code as well: the prefix \\"0549\\" is assigned to San Marino. Dialing either \\"+378xxxxxx\\" or \\"+390549xxxxxx\\" will reach the same number. Mobile phone customers are sometimes assigned Italian phone numbers.  Vatican City  The country code 379 is assigned to Vatican City, but it is not used: telephone numbers in Vatican City are integrated into the Italian numbering plan. Vatican landline telephone numbers are in the form \\"+3906698xxxxx\\", \\"+39\\" being the country code for Italy and \\"06\\" the prefix for Rome.

In simple terms chemical precursors are sprayed across an electrostatic field towards a heated substrate, the chemicals undergo a controlled chemical reaction and are deposited on the substrate as the required coating. Electrostatic spraying techniques were developed in the 1950s for the spraying of ionised particles on to charged or heated substrates.Rupp, Joel; Guffy, Eri; Jacobsen, Gary. \\"Electrostatic spray processes\\". TW Ransburg Electrostatic Systems, in Metal Finishing 2012 Organic Finishing Guidebook. Elsevier. p. 126-127. 2012 ESAVD (branded by IMPT as Layatec) is used for many applications in many markets including: * Thermal barrier coatings for jet engine turbine blades * Various thin layers in the manufacture of flat panel displays and photovoltaic panels, CIGS and CZTS- based thin-film solar cells. * Electronic components * Biomedical coatings * Glass coatings (such as self-cleaning) * Corrosion protection coatings The process has advantages over other techniques for layer deposition (Plasma, Electron-Beam) in that it does not require the use of any vacuum, electron beam or plasma so reduces the manufacturing costs. It also uses less power and raw materials making it more environmentally friendly. Also the use of the electrostatic field means that the process can coat complex 3D parts easily.

Location Kingston is situated about two miles south of Corfe Castle and five miles west of Swanage. The village of Kingston is situated on a hill near Swyre Head, the highest point of the Purbeck Hills. The village is surrounded by woods and stands at a height of over 400 ft (120 Metres) above sea level and can be seen from far away. Kingston lies within the civil parish of Corfe Castle. The parish forms part of the Purbeck local government district. History The village is notable because it has two churches. Since the 12th century, up until 1877, Kingston had been a chapelry of Corfe Castle. A chapel stood on the east side of the village and it was served by the Rector of Corfe Castle or his assistant. In 1833 John Scott, the first Earl of Eldon, (later Lord Chancellor Eldon) replaced the chapel, at his own expense, with the present church building standing on the site. It was designed by his son-in-law, George Repton, and largely followed the ground plan of the replaced chapel, embodying most of the old building material. The church was surrounded by many graves. The first Earl and his wife are buried in the churchyard. The old church remained in use as the church hall for many years, later it became disused and is now a private residence. Many of the gravestones were transferred to a separate graveyard, while others were used for paving or broken up. The other church, St James's Church, is quite elaborate. It was built in 1874, completed in 1880, by the third Earl of Eldon, the architect was George Edmund Street (1824‚Äì1881). St James's Church resembles a miniature of an early English cathedral. It is a cruciform building, with an apse, central tower and narthex, built throughout of Purbeck stone. Its tower dominates the landscape. The tower, which is somewhat disproportionate in size to the rest of the church, was made large enough to contain a full ring of eight bells, which were cast and installed by John Taylor & Co., of Loughborough, in 1880. Two more bells were added in 2000 to make a ring of 10 bells. Dove's Guide - Kingston St James Inside the clustered pillars and other details are made of Purbeck marble, quarried from Lord Eldon‚Äôs estate and worked by his own craftsmen. It did not replace the existing church immediately and in effect for over forty years it was the private chapel of the Eldon family. In April 1921 Lord Eldon conveyed the church and churchyard to the Church Commissioners. On 11 October 1921 they were consecrated by the Rt. Rev. Bishop Jocelyne. In January 1922 the new church substituted the old one by the Church Commissioners. There was also a Wesleyan Chapel, built in 1861, at the foot of Kingston Hill. The building still stands and now it is a private residence. The first school in Kingston was established on 24 September 1786. The school house for up to 100 children with residence for the school master, was erected in 1856, in memory of the Earl and Countess of Eldon, by their children. The old school house building is now a private residence. The village pub dates from 1787. Originally it was known as the ‚ÄòNew Inn‚Äô. Its name was changed to the Eldon Arms in the early 19th century. After the Second World War the name was changed to The Scott Arms.

She appeared in more than 70 movies, earning best actress awards from the Argentine Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Spanish Cinema Writers Circle. Biography Zulema Esther Gonz√°lez Borb√≥n was born on 17 October 1920 in the town of Villa Ballester, part of the General San Mart√≠n Partido in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. She dreamed of becoming an actress, but went to work as a seamstress at a young age due to financial hardship, after her father's death when she was ten years old, followed when she was fourteen by her elder brother's death. She made many visits to the theaters in search of parts, and in 1938, answering a notice for extras, she was hired for a minor role in C√°ndida, under the direction of Luis Bayon Herrera and starring Nin√≠ Marshall. She then had a string of films, including Bartolo ten√≠a una flauta (1939), Azahares rojos (1940), De M√©xico lleg√≥ el amor (1940) and Orquesta de se√±oritas (1941), in which she played minor roles. During the filming of Orquesta de se√±oritas she met Luis Cesar Amadori, who would become her husband, several years later. Her first starring role was in the film En el √∫ltimo piso (1942), which led to a role opposite Mirtha Legrand in Su hermana menor. She was launched to stardom with Stella (1943), directed by Benito Perojo. The Hollywood-style, big budget production, with haute couture costumes gave her a glamor like few other actresses had at the time and led to a style that became known as \\"cine de los tel√©fonos blancos\\" (cinema of the white telephone). Stella was followed with roles alongside some of Argentina's biggest stars, including: Pedro L√≥pez Lagar in both Apasionadamente (1944) and Celos (1946); Angel Maga√±a in Nunca te dir√© adi√≥s (1947); and Arturo de C√≥rdova in Dios se lo pague (1948). Dios se lo pague was directed by Luis Cesar Amadori, who Moreno had married in 1947 and was one of the first foreign films ever nominated for an Academy Award. The film debuted on 16 March 1948 in Mar del Plata, at the inaugural Argentine Film Festival, and Moreno won best actress from the Argentine Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. Zully Moreno ca. 1950 Moreno's marriage marked a change in the type roles that she played and her movement into diva status. Prior to that time, from 1939 to 1945, her roles were primarily melodramatic comedies and portrayed modern, urban women. These films reflect the changing role of women after the Second World War, where women are not confined solely to home and children, but part of the world, making decisions. Innocent, but not na√Øve, worldly, but not too worldly and introducing the first inklings that romance could be an emotional and sexual attraction for women rather than love simply being a spiritual passive feminine duty. In the contrary, after her marriage, Moreno became the embodiment of elegance, luxury, and glamor. Most of her films were pure melodrama and almost always there was a scene of an evening- dress clad woman entering a casino, or theater in which a long-camera watched as her coat was removed and unveiled the beautiful woman beneath. Zully Moreno at the theater ca. 1958 Though she often worked with her husband, Moreno also worked with some of Argentina's biggest directors. She was directed by Mario Soffici in La gata (1947) and by Carlos Hugo Christensen in La trampa (1949). Her husband directed her in Nacha Regules (1950) and Mar√≠a Montecristo (1951) and in Cosas de mujer (1951), she was directed by Carlos Schlieper. In La mujer de las camelias (1952) she was directed by Ernesto Arancibia but also met Horace Lannes, who going-forward would be her preferred designer. \\"Camelias\\" won Moreno her second Best Actress award from the Argentine Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1953 and the inaugural Best Foreign Film award at the 1955 Golden Globes from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. Her last film in Argentina was Amor prohibido, made under the direction of her husband, filmed in 1955, but it was not released until 1958. In 1955, when Juan Per√≥n's government was overthrown by the Revoluci√≥n Libertadora, a coup d'√©tat, Amadori was arrested and tortured. Upon his release from prison, he and Moreno fled to Spain. She continued working in Spain, filming Madrugada (1957) with director Antonio Roman, for which she won the C√≠rculo de Escritores Cinematogr√°ficos (CEC) (Cinema Writers Circle) award for Best Actress. That same year, at the Film Festival San Sebastian, Moreno received the award which typified her screen persona, with a certificate honoring her as most elegant actress. Her next film was La noche y el alba (1959) directed by Jos√© Mar√≠a Forqu√©, followed by Una gran se√±ora (1959) and Un trono para Cristy (1960), both directed by her husband, Amadori. After the death of Amadori in 1977, she returned permanently to Argentina and led the Teatro Maipo and chaired the production of Argentina Sono Film briefly, but then turned away from the media and became reclusive as her Alzheimer's advanced. Family life Moreno married Luis Cesar Amadori in 1947 and they had one son, Luis. During their years of exile in Spain, the family shared living spaces with Alberto Closas, his wife Marisa, and their family, moving back and forth between properties in Madrid and Alicante. In 1966, she began returning to Argentina incognito, wanting her son to know his heritage. After years of visiting, in 1970, she purchased an apartment Buenos Aires, on Avenida Del Libertador. She died on 25 December 1999 in Buenos Aires, a victim of Alzheimer's disease. She was buried in the Pantheon of Actors at Chacarita Cemetery.

In that year, a closed telephone numbering plan was adopted, with eight-digit telephone numbers incorporating the area code and full number dialling for local and national calls. Service numbers were to be three digits long, Directory numbers four digits and some companies were allocated five-digit numbers, ex. 07575. GSM telephony was introduced in 1993, and those numbers always start with the digits '4' or '9'. Emergency numbers Historically, the local operator would take emergency calls and forward them to the police, fire or local doctor. In 1964, the emergency number 000 was introduced.

The ARC is the largest trans-ocean sailing event in the world and regularly attracts over 200 boats of many different shapes and sizes. The route takes between 8 and 31 days aided by trade winds, and covers over 2700 nautical miles. Founded by Jimmy Cornell it is now organised by the World Cruising Club, which also arranges a World ARC. The first race was organised in 1986 by Cruising World Magazine under the name Atlantic R a c e for Cruisers (ARC). The founder Jimmy Cornell's idea was to create an amateur event and to add some zest to the long and lonely voyage across the ocean and strengthen bonds between cruising sailors. Another consideration was to increase safety and confidence by organising a passage of large number of yachts at the same time.Cruising World Magazine, October 1986, pages 104-105 In the first year the route started from Las Palmas and ended in Bridgetown Barbados. The number of participants was 204 yachts. The fastest monohull 62-foot Moonshadow sailed across in 14 days and 3 hours. The winner of Yachting World Trophy for first yacht to arrive in Barbados was 54-foot trimaran Running Cloud.

For instance, to call Vancouver, Canada, from Kyiv, users dial 00 1 778 xxx xxxx. Calling nationwide requires dialing 0 and then the region code followed by the local number. For instance, to call Kyiv from Odessa, users dial 0 44 xxx xxxx. The same convention was adopted for mobile operators. For local calls, users can still dial the local number without a 0 and the area code. Mobile users must dial the full 0-prefixed number, although operators may implement local dialing in cities. The in-country sequence for ordinary zones consists of a 2-digit zone code, an optional subzone code (never used for the capital of the geographic region corresponding to a phone zone), an optional filler (0 to 2 \\"2\\"s, used to make the whole in-country sequence contain exactly 9 digits) and the local phone number (5 to 7 digits). When dialing from cell phones, the in-country dial sequence (with the 0 XX prefix) is used even for phones of the same provider. Otherwise a call may be placed in the nearest geographic area. Area codes correspond to geographic regions (\\"oblasts\\") with exception of Kyiv and formerly Sevastopol which utilize their own area code. See Area codes in Ukraine for current list. Cell phone numbers can be assigned both within the cell phone provider zone and within a geographic zone. The latter arrangement is used mainly for CDMA phones and for GSM operators selling their connectivity within one city, like GoldenTelecom GSM. Allocation of new GSM cell phone numbers within a geographic zone is very rare now because law requires all incoming calls to be free, including incoming calls to a cell phone. Some examples of dialed sequences: xxx-xx-xx (two PSTN phones within Kyiv, local number is 7 digits long) 050 xxx-xx-xx (from any Ukraine mobile not roaming or PSTN phone to Vodafone, cell phone provider) 067 xxx-xx-xx (from any Ukraine mobile not roaming or PSTN phone to Kyivstar, cell phone provider) 0800 xxx-xxx (from any Ukraine mobile not roaming or PSTN phone to toll-free number) 044 xxx-xx-xx (from any Ukraine mobile not roaming or PSTN phone outside the Kyiv phone zone to Kyiv) 045 94x-xx-xx (from any Ukraine mobile not roaming or PSTN phone outside the Brovary region phone zone to Brovary) 046 xxx-xx-xx (from any Ukraine mobile not roaming or PSTN phone outside the Chernihiv phone zone to Chernihiv) 032 2xx-xx-xx (from any Ukraine mobile not roaming or PSTN phone outside the Lviv phone zone to Lviv; the local number is 6 digits long, so \\"2\\" is used as a filler to make the whole in-country dial sequence 9 digits long) 00 ... (mobile or fixed international call from Ukraine) +380 44 xxx-xx-xx (international call to Kyiv) +380 45 94x-xx-xx (international call to Brovary) +380 48 xxx-xx-xx (international call to Odessa) +380 48 2xx-xx-xx (international call to 6-digit numbers in Odessa) +380 32 xxx-xx-xx (international call to Lviv) +380 32 2xx-xx-xx (international call to 6-digit numbers in Lviv) +380 50 xxx-xx-xx (international call to Vodafone) +380 66 xxx-xx-xx (international call to Vodafone) +380 95 xxx-xx-xx (international call to Vodafone) +380 99 xxx-xx-xx (international call to Vodafone) +380 63 xxx-xx-xx (international call to lifecell) +380 73 xxx-xx-xx (international call to lifecell) +380 93 xxx-xx-xx (international call to lifecell) +380 67 xxx-xx-xx (international call to Kyivstar) +380 68 xxx-xx-xx (international call to Kyivstar) +380 96 xxx-xx-xx (international call to Kyivstar) +380 97 xxx-xx-xx (international call to Kyivstar) +380 98 xxx-xx-xx (international call to Kyivstar) +380 91 xxx-xx-xx (international call to 3mob) +380 92 xxx- xx-xx (international call to PEOPLEnet) +380 94 xxx-xx-xx (international call to Intertelecom) Some mobile operators may support additional dialing plans. For example, Kyivstar also supports the following: xxx-xx-xx (local number at current location of Kyivstar mobile - i.e. if the mobile is currently in Kyiv this will represent a Kyiv number) 67-xxx-xx-xx (call from Kyivstar subscriber to Kyivstar subscriber) Note that law explicitly prohibits trunk calls to a PSTN phone within the same local area in a geographic phone zone (e.g. from Kyiv to Kyiv), so one cannot dial 0~2 or 0~xx for this, unless the phone exchange is misconfigured or a special circumstance occurs. The switch to a closed numbering plan, which will introduce seven digit-long numbers for all zones, should be complete in 2011-2012.http://zakon1.rada.gov.ua/cgi- bin/laws/main.cgi?nreg=z1014-08 Notice, that when using older non-digital extensions for the inter-city, international calls as well as the calls made to the national mobile and sip-numbers, it may be necessary to wait for a continuous dial tone after the first 0. This applies to the old-style rotary phones (as opposed to modern digital dial phones). For example, to call a Chernihiv local landline number from Kyiv, one needs to dial 0, wait for a dial tone, then dial 46 (Chernivtsi regional code) and then dial the local number in that city. Similarly, when calling Vancouver, Canada, one needs to dial 0, wait for the dial tone, dial another 0 to access international line, then dial 1 (for Canada and the USA), followed by 778 (one of the area codes for British Columbia), followed by the 7-digit local number. Due to the last digit of the country code (+380) being identical to the trunk prefix (0), international format numbers are often presented as +38 0..., e.g. the (fictional) Kyiv number +38 044 555 1234. +38 belonged to Yugoslavia before its disintegration in the early 1990s, and the +38 code was broken up and distributed amongst the former republics. +380 went to Ukraine, which previously used the +7 code.  Previous dialing plan  Ukraine (similarly to most of ex-Soviet Union countries) used to have a four-level (local, zone, country, international) open dialing plan. For all non-local numbers, the required trunk prefix was '8' followed by an auxiliary dial tone after it (optional on digital exchanges), with the following '2' for in-zone calls, followed by an area code, and '10' for international calls.

Geertje Dircx [Àà…£…™Àêrc…ô d…™rks] (c. 1610-1615 - c. 1656) was the lover of Rembrandt van Rijn after the death of his wife Saskia. She was hired as a wetnurse to the painter's son Titus, but lived with Rembrandt as his lover for several years. The relationship broke up acrimoniously, leading to a lengthy court-case for \\"breach of promise\\" (a euphemism for seduction under [breached] promise to marry), in which she claimed maintenance from Rembrandt. She was eventually imprisoned after displaying increasingly unstable behaviour. After her release she tried to sue Rembrandt for wrongful imprisonment. She may be the model for a number of Rembrandt's works, but there is disagreement about which images depict her. Life=In Rembrandt's service Geertje was born in Edam. Between 1630 and 1640, she worked in an inn in Hoorn. At some point she was married to Abraham Claesz, a trumpeter, but her husband died. After that she lodged with her brother Pieter, a ship's carpenter in Waterland. It was possibly through him that she got to know Rembrandt. She entered Rembrandt's service in around 1643, as a childless widow. She lived with Rembrandt for six years in the Sint Antoniesbreestraat and nursed his son Titus. During this time she and Rembrandt apparently entered into a relationship, an arrangement which was not uncommon. He gave her a number of rings that had belonged to his deceased wife, Saskia van Uylenburgh, a gesture not much appreciated by Saskia's family. A few years later Geertje would expect Rembrandt to marry her, but such an arrangement would have resulted in the loss of Saskia's inheritance. Legal proceedings In May 1649 she and Rembrandt quarreled, probably as a consequence of Rembrandt's new relationship with his housekeeper Hendrickje Stoffels. The couple separated and Rembrandt came to an agreement with Geertje that he would pay her 160 guilders, plus an annual stipend of 60 guilders for the rest of her life, as long as she did not change her will which named Titus as her heir.Paul Crenshaw, Rembrandt's Bankruptcy: The Artist, His Patrons, and the Art World in Seventeenth-Century Holland, Cambridge University Press, 2006, p.41. In June, Geertje rented a room above a seamens' bar. By October, Geertje had requested additional support from Rembrandt, having pawned jewellery given to her by Rembrandt to maintain her livelihood . Although he was not legally required to do so, Rembrandt paid her 200 guilders to redeem the jewellery and agreed to increase her stipend to 160 guilders a year, on the continued condition that she would not change her will. A Woman in Bed (1645). National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh. According to Gary Schwartz, the woman in the picture could be Dircx or Hendrickje Stoffels. Geertje, however, refused to accept this settlement, claiming that it would not cover her expenses if she became seriously ill or infirm. When Geertje came to sign the agreement with Rembrandt in the presence of a notary, she refused to sign to the agreement. She summoned Rembrandt before the Commissioners of Marital Affairs on a charge of breach of promise and took his gifts such as a diamond ring to a pawnbroker's to fund the case. The commissioners raised the annual sum to 200 guilders. The court particularly stated that Rembrandt had to pay a maintenance allowance, provided that Titus remained her only heir and she sold none of Rembrandt's possessions. However, Geertje continued to demand money from Rembrandt, possibly to the point of blackmail. In the summer of 1650, Rembrandt participated in an effort to have Geertje sent to the \\"spinhuis\\" in Gouda, a women's house of correction, sometimes referred to as an insane asylum.Rembrandt ‚Äî Chronology 1636-1650. Mystudios.com, retrieved June 6, 2011 Historian Patrick Hunt describes it as \\"virtual prison for destitute and diseased prostitutes as well as an asylum for the mentally unhinged. Geertje probably lived up to the latter requisite by ranting and raving 'most vehemently'\\".Hunt, Patrick, Rembrandt: his life in art Ariel Books, 2007, p.89. Historians have had differing views about the facts behind this dispute. It seems that her brother and nephew, along with a number of Geertje's neighbours, supported some of Rembrandt's claims against her. She was condemned to twelve years' confinement. In 1652 she petitioned for her release, but was refused. In 1655 she became ill. A friend of hers named Trijn Jacobs eventually managed to persuade the council to intervene on her behalf and Geertje was freed from prison, having been confined for five years.Driessen, Christoph (2012): Rembrandts vrouwen, p 162-163. After her release she prepared a complaint against Rembrandt for wrongful imprisonment on grounds of slander and false testimonies. According to Christoph Driessen, ‚Äú[t]he audacity and tenaciousness she showed to fight the highly respected and established Rembrandt command one‚Äôs admiration‚Äù.Driessen, Christoph (2012): Rembrandts vrouwen, p 167. Rembrandt filed a counter-suit and secured an order that her brother Peter must not leave the Netherlands as he was required as a witness (he was intending to work as a carpenter on board a ship bound for India). On 8 August 1656 Geertje is listed as one of Rembrandt's seven major creditors. She probably died shortly after this. Rembrandt's financial situation had deteriorated seriously during this period, and Geertje's new demands may have been the \\"final straw\\" that led to his filing for bankruptcy. Dramatic portrayals In the 1936 film Rembrandt she is depicted as a highly unpleasant, shrewish and conniving woman. She is portrayed by Gertrude Lawrence, making one of her very rare film appearances. She also appears in Peter Greenaway's film Nightwatching, played by Jodhi May. Again she is portrayed negatively, as a spy hired by conspirators to discredit Rembrandt. She also appears in the 1942 German film Rembrandt played by Elisabeth Flickenschildt. In television she is depicted by Jenny Tanghe in the drama Hendrickje Stoffels (1963), by Caroline van Houten in Rembrandt (1999) and by Marieke Heebink in the Dutch 2011 series Rembrandt en ik.

In particular, the DLIN assumption is useful in settings where the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption does not hold (as is often the case in pairing-based cryptography). The Decision Linear assumption was introduced by Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham.Dan Boneh, Xavier Boyen, Hovav Shacham: Short Group Signatures. CRYPTO 2004: 41-55 Informally the DLIN assumption states that given (u, \\\\, v, \\\\, h, \\\\, u^x, \\\\, v^y), with u, \\\\, v, \\\\, h random group elements and x, \\\\, y random exponents, it is hard to distinguish h^{x+y} from an independent random group element \\\\eta. Motivation In symmetric pairing-based cryptography the group G is equipped with a pairing e :G \\\\times G \\\\to T which is bilinear. This map gives an efficient algorithm to solve the decisional Diffie-Hellman problem. John Bethencourt: Intro to Bilinear Maps Given input (g, \\\\, g^a, \\\\, g^b, \\\\, h), it is easy to check if h is equal to g^{ab}. This follows by using the pairing: note that :e(g^a, g^b) = e(g,g)^{ab} = e(g,g^{ab}). Thus, if h = g^{ab}, then the values e(g^a, g^b) and e(g,h) will be equal. Since this cryptographic assumption, essential to building ElGamal encryption and signatures, does not hold in this case, new assumptions are needed to build cryptography in symmetric bilinear groups. The DLIN assumption is a modification of Diffie- Hellman type assumptions to thwart the above attack. Formal definition Let G be a cyclic group of prime order p. Let u, v, and h be uniformly random generators of G. Let x,y be uniformly random elements of {1, \\\\, 2, \\\\, \\\\dots, \\\\, p-1}. Define a distribution :D_1 = (u, \\\\, v, \\\\, h, \\\\, u^x, \\\\, v^y, \\\\, h^{x+y}). Let \\\\eta be another uniformly random element of G. Define another distribution :D_2 = (u, \\\\, v, \\\\, h, \\\\, u^x, \\\\, v^y, \\\\, \\\\eta). The Decision Linear assumption states that D_1 and D_2 are computationally indistinguishable. Applications=Linear encryption Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham define a public key encryption scheme by analogy to ElGamal encryption. In this scheme, a public key is the generators u,v,h. The private key is two exponents such that u^x = v^y = h. Encryption combines a message m \\\\in G with the public key to create a ciphertext :c := (c_1, \\\\, c_2, \\\\, c_3) = (u^a, \\\\, v^b, \\\\, m \\\\cdot h^{a+b}). To decrypt the ciphertext, the private key can be used to compute :m' := c_3 \\\\cdot (c_1^x \\\\cdot c_2^y)^{-1}. To check that this encryption scheme is correct, i.e. m' = m when both parties follow the protocol, note that :m' = c_3 \\\\cdot (c_1^x \\\\cdot c_2^y)^{-1} = m \\\\cdot h^{a+b} \\\\cdot ((u^a)^x \\\\cdot (v^b)^y)^{-1} = m \\\\cdot h^{a+b} \\\\cdot ((u^x)^a \\\\cdot (v^y)^b)^{-1}. Then using the fact that u^x = v^y = h yields :m' = m \\\\cdot h^{a+b} \\\\cdot (h^a \\\\cdot h^b)^{-1} = m \\\\cdot (h^{a+b} \\\\cdot h^{-a-b}) = m. Further, this scheme is IND-CPA secure assuming that the DLIN assumption holds. Short group signatures Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham also use DLIN in a scheme for group signatures. The signatures are called \\"short group signatures\\" because, with a standard security level, they can be represented in only 250 bytes. Their protocol first uses linear encryption in order to define a special type of zero-knowledge proof. Then the Fiat‚ÄìShamir heuristic is applied to transform the proof system into a digital signature. They prove this signature fulfills the additional requirements of unforgeability, anonymity, and traceability required of a group signature. Their proof relies on not only the DLIN assumption but also another assumption called the q-strong Diffie-Hellman assumption. It is proven in the random oracle model. Other applications Since its definition in 2004, the Decision Linear assumption has seen a variety of other applications.

Julie finds that she is legally married to both Marty and Vernon. She soon realises that she must choose who she wants to be with, if only to avoid being branded a bigamist. But Julie loves the idea of having two husbands and so she decides to try to live with them both, to the annoyance and disapproval of Marty and Vernon who both know that her idea will not work out. Meanwhile, Julie's close friend Gwen (Marge Champion) has a secret crush on Marty and hopes to be with him, if only Julie could make her up mind as to who she wants. After a long serious decision and a talk with them both, Julie decides that she is more in love with Marty and she leaves Vernon, who has now fallen for Gwen.

Name In the United States and Canada, warden is the most common title for an official in charge of a prison or jail. In some US states, the post may also be known as a superintendent. Some small county jails may be managed by the local sheriff or undersheriff. In the UK and Australia, the position is known as a governor. In New Zealand and private prisons in the UK, the position is known as a director. In India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, the English-language title is a jail superintendent or just superintendent. The exact title varies depending on the type of prison. Duties The prison warden supervises all the operations within the prison. Prisons vary in size, with some housing thousands of inmates. They are responsible for the prison's security, the performance of staff of the prison (including prison officers, prison doctors, janitors, cooks and others), the management of its funds, the maintenance of its facilities and the welfare of its inmates. In practice, the day-to-day management of security is typically delegated to the head of security, who will be an assistant or subordinate of the warden. A warden's regular work may involve supervising security, making inspections, carrying out disciplinary procedures, writing reports, managing admissions and liaising with other professional staff who visit the prison, such as medical staff, probation officers, and social workers. Wardens are sometimes members of parole boards. They may also train staff to work in the prison service. The nature of the work depends on the size and type of prison. The amount of security a prison needs varies from open prisons to supermax or high-security prisons. Skills and interests Prison wardens should: * be able to work well with a variety of other people * have good written and spoken communication skills * care about prisoners‚Äô welfare and be sympathetic to their problems * be self-confident and able to lead both staff and prisoners * be able to cope with pressure and enforce discipline * be able to handle difficult situations and emergencies, such as prison gang violence By country=India Prisons in India are run by the provincial prison service. Each jail or prison is managed by a superintendent. The precise title varies by prison and state. A superintendent is typically assisted by a deputy superintendent and one or more assistants. United Kingdom There are currently 139 operational prisons in England and Wales, 16 in Scotland and three in Northern Ireland. There are three separate prison services covering England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. The manager of a prison is known as a prison governor. The exception is a number of private or contracted-out prisons which are managed by a director instead. The director is assisted by a controller, appointed by the Ministry of Justice. Entry and training varies between these services. Prospective governors would need to pass medical, eyesight and fitness tests, and should be a UK citizen or EU national and be prepared to relocate if necessary. The companies that run private prison establishments each have their own entry requirements and recruitment methods. Entry to governor jobs is competitive, by whichever route. In England and Wales graduate vacancies are advertised each year (usually October) in the national press. Opportunities for direct entry in Scotland are advertised in both the Scottish and national press. In England and Wales there are two main routes into becoming a prison governor. The first is for existing staff to move up through the ranks (from being a prison officer, for example, or to move across from other management roles). The second route is through the Prison Service Intensive Development Scheme (IDS). This route is only open to those holding degrees, with a preference for candidates with relevant experience in the armed forces or police. The upper age limit for prison governor entry is 57. With this scheme it is possible to reach senior management in less than five years rather than the usual average twenty years. In Scotland, there are two ways to enter. This is again through promotion from prison officer ranks or through direct entry. Direct entry applicants usually need a degree and substantial management experience.

These qualities make them ideal for astronomy, communications, meteorology, and environmental uses.Spaceflight Now ‚ÄúSatellite formation flying concept becoming a reality‚Äù Types of formations Landsat-7 being trailed by EO-1 covering the same area at different timesDepending on the application, there are three formations possible: trailing, cluster, and constellation. * Trailing formations are formed by multiple satellites orbiting on the same path. Each one follows the previous one separated by a specific time interval to either view a target at different times, or obtain varied viewing angles of the target. Trailing satellites are especially suited for meteorological and environmental applications such as viewing the progress of a fire, cloud formations, and making 3D views of hurricanes. Notable pairs are Landsat 7 with EO-1, the \\"A-train\\" consisting of CALIPSO and CloudSat (among others), and Terra with Aqua. * Cluster formations are formed by satellites in a dense (relatively tightly spaced) arrangement. These arrangements are best for high resolution interferometry and making maps of Earth. TechSat-21 was a suggested satellite model capable of operating in clusters. * Constellation formations can be considered to be a number of satellites with coordinated ground coverage, operating together under shared control, synchronised so that they overlap well in coverage and complement rather than interfere with other satellites' important coverage Usually, these formations are made up of numerous small satellites. A micro satellite weighs under 100 kg and a nano satellite weighs under 10 kg. Magnetosheric Constellation, for instance, would be composed of 100 micro satellites.(see ) This technology has become more viable thanks to the development of autonomous flying. With an onboard computer and this algorithm, satellites may autonomously position themselves into a formation. Previously, ground control would have to adjust each satellite to maintain formations. Now, satellites may arrive at and maintain formations with faster response time and have the ability to change the formation for varied resolution of observations. Also, satellites may be launched from different spacecraft and rendezvous on a particular path. This advance was made possible by Dave Folta, John Bristow, and Dave Quinn at NASA‚Äôs Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). Cluster formation for the proposed TechSat-21 mission.

Early life Pritt was born and grew up in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, the son of Walter Charles Ashby Pritt, a cotton factor (commission merchant), and his wife Marguerite Bianca Selina Pritt. His army records indicate that he attended St Peter's School in York from September 1909 to February 1916. He passed the entrance exams for Sandhurst in February 1916, but was rejected for officer training as being too small. First World War After being rejected by Sandhurst he opted to try flying. On 16 September 1916 Pritt passed his Royal Aero Club flying test and was awarded Aviators' Certificate No. 3564, after soloing a Caudron at the Wallisdown School in Bournemouth, and was then accepted by the Royal Flying Corps for flying training as a cadet. He underwent training at the Cadet School at Denham and No. 2 School of Military Aeronautics at Oxford. Commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant (on probation) on the General List for service on the RFC on 4 March 1917. he was then posted to No. 41 Reserve Squadron and No. 15 Reserve Squadron where he gained his RFC wings, and was appointed a flying officer on 2 June 1917. He was then posted to No. 40 Reserve Squadron, and on 4 July 1917 was sent to France where he joined No. 66 Squadron. During the five-month period, 4 July to 14 November 1917, while flying Sopwith Pups with No. 66 Squadron Pritt became an ace, officially credited with five aircraft destroyed; there is evidence of a possible sixth victory. He was also awarded the Military Cross on 26 September 1917. His citation read: :Temporary Second Lieutenant Walbanke Ashby Pritt, General List and Royal Flying Corps. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty in attacking a hostile aerodrome with exceptional dash and determination. Having reached his objective and dropped bombs from a very low altitude, he then attacked and destroyed two hostile machines almost as soon as they had left the ground. A machine-gun then opened upon him from the aerodrome, which he immediately attacked. Both on his outward and homeward journey he was under very heavy machine-gun and anti-aircraft fire. On another occasion he attacked a motor-car, and shot one of the occupants from about 50 feet, afterwards attacking infantry on the march and inflicting severe casualties upon them. He has at all times shown constant gallantry and fine offensive spirit.\\" On 15 February 1918 Pritt was injured while flying Sopwith Camel (B7332) of No. 44 Squadron; he had an engine failure at 500 feet over Hainault Farm, flying downwind he stalled and spun in. Post war On 19 April 1920 Pritt was granted a Short Service Commission in the RAF with the rank of flying officer. In August 1920, he failed the RAF Flight Instructor Course at the Central Flying School. The accompanying note states \\"did not take exams, absent sick, CFS cat B, graded unsuitable as instructor at present\\". He resigned his commission on 8 December 1920, but was denied permission to retain his rank because of \\"unsatisfactory dealings with cheques\\". On 15 April 1921 Pritt was commissioned as a temporary lieutenant in the 5th Battalion, West Yorkshire Regiment, part of the Territorial Army. Pritt was married in 1925. There is no record of any children and his wife was still referred to as Mrs. Pritt until her death in 1965.

Since the 1991 Gulf War, thousands of Iraqis have found refuge in Australia. The total of population is estimated to be as high as 95,000.http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Fear-checks-turnout-for-Iraq- poll/2005/01/21/1106110948104.html Australia's Iraqi-born population includes Arabs, Assyrians, Kurds, Armenians, Mandeans, Turkmens and Jews. The first year in which the Australian Census of Population and Housing recorded the Iraq-born separately was 1976, when the population was 2,273. By 1986, the population had risen to 4,516. By the end of the Gulf War in 1991, it numbered 5,186, mainly in New South Wales and Victoria. Many recent arrivals have entered Australia under the Humanitarian programme. The Gulf War and the quelling of uprisings of the Shi'a and the Kurds in Iraq resulted in a large increase in the number of Iraqis coming to Australia after 1991. There were 28,760 Iraq-born people in Australia at the 2001 Census, making up 0.6 per cent of the overseas-born population. History The number of permanent settlers arriving in Australia from Iraq since 1991 (monthly) People born in Iraq as a percentage of the population in Sydney divided geographically by postal area, as of the 2011 census Iraqi-born Victorians were first identified in the Victorian census in 1976, when 189 people were recorded. Within five years the community had almost tripled to 408, and by 1991 had increased to 603. Most Iraqis had escaped hardships caused by the eight-year Iran‚ÄìIraq War, which ended in 1988. The outbreak of the Gulf War in 1991 led a large number of people to flee Iraq into the neighbouring countries. Some refugees lived in processing camps for up to five years before being accepted into Australia under the Special Humanitarian Program. During this period the visas of around 400 Iraqis living in Australia were extended until the end of the Gulf War. Iraqi immigration to Australia peaked between 1992 and 1995, with the Iraq- born population in Victoria increasing to 3,492 by 1996. By 2001 this community had increased a further 74% to 6,091 people. Most recent Iraqi immigrants have arrived under the Family and Skilled Migration categories. Some Iraqis have sought refugee status after arrival in Australia, and have been detained pending processing. Today the Iraq-born community in Australia is culturally diverse, with settlers from many ethnic and cultural backgrounds including Arabs, Assyrians, Kurds, Turkomans. Although Islam is the dominant religion in Iraq, only 29% of the Iraq-born immigrants living in Victoria are Muslim; 68% are Christian and who are mostly Assyrian. Nearly half of the Iraqi community speaks Arabic at home; only 3% speaks English, reflecting the number of recent immigrants in the community. Over half of Iraq-born Victorians are aged under 35, and only 12% are aged over fifty. Of those in the workforce, both men and women are most commonly employed as labourers and related workers within the manufacturing industry, while nearly a quarter are employed in professional positions. The community is supported by organisations such as the Australian Iraqi Forum several religious or cultural associations.

Griffith stated that the database was constructed by compiling the anonymous edits included amongst the monthly public database dumps of Wikipedia. He claimed to have connected the organizations to their IP address with the assistance of the IP2Location, and through comparison had found \\"187,529 different organizations with at least one anonymous Wikipedia edit.\\" WikiScanner only worked on anonymous edits that had provided an IP address, not edits by anyone logged in under a username. It could not distinguish between edits made by authorized users of an organization, unauthorized intruders, or users of public-access computers that may have been using an organization's network. In discussing edits made from computers in the Vatican, computer expert Kevin Curran was quoted by the BBC as saying that it was \\"difficult to determine if the person was an employee or if they had maliciously hacked into the Vatican system and were 'spoofing' the IP address.\\" The WikiScanner FAQ noted that edits could not be positively attributed to representatives of a company, only to a computer logged into a company's network. The FAQ went on to say there is no guarantee that an edit was made by an authorized user rather than an intruder. The likelihood of such intrusions depended upon an organizations' network security; organizations such as the Vatican Library have public access terminals or networks. Media coverage and reaction According to Wired, which first broke the story on 13 August 2007, most edits were \\"fairly innocuous\\". Wired asked users to submit \\"The most shameful Wikipedia spin jobs\\", which generated many news stories about organizations, such as the Al- Jazeera network, Fox News Channel, staffers of Democratic Senator Robert Byrd and the CIA, that had edited Wikipedia articles. On August 21, 2007, satirist Stephen Colbert who had long featured stories about Wikipedia and its \\"truthiness\\" on his program mocked WikiScanner creator Virgil Griffith's ambivalent stance on anonymity on Wikipedia, declaring it the \\"right\\" of corporations and governments to participate in the democratic process of deciding what is and is not true on Wikipedia.The Colbert Report. Comedy Central. August 21, 2007 According to the BBC from August 15, 2007, WikiScanner found that some editorial contributions to Wikipedia had originated from computers operated by the Diebold company, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as well as the Vatican. The Times reported that an IP address at the BBC had made edits to Wikipedia. page 2 The BBC's Head of Interactive News, Pete Clifton published a blog on August 16 acknowledging the earlier omission, but characterized the BBC's edits of Wikipedia in this manner: \\"Some of the examples are pretty unedifying, but for every dodgy one there are many, many more uncontroversial edits where people at the BBC have added information or changed a detail in good faith\\". The Associated Press reported on August 15, 2007 that computers owned by the Church of Scientology had been used to remove criticism from articles about Scientology on Wikipedia, including edits to the article Cult Awareness Network. The Associated Press admitted that edits to Wikipedia had been made anonymously from its own computers, though the news organization did not describe the content of the edits. In its story on WikiScanner, the New York Times too admitted that edits had been made from its own computers. Wired.com reported the office of former Republican Senator Conrad Burns had also edited critical passages. According to Maltastar.com from August 16, WikiScanner has shown edits by other large organizations, including Amnesty International, Apple Inc., ChevronTexaco, Coca-Cola, the British Conservative Party, Dell Computers, EA Games, Exxon Mobil, the FBI, The Guardian, Microsoft, MySpace, the National Rifle Association, Nestl√©, News of the World, the New York Times, the Government of Portugal, the US Republican Party, Reuters, Sony, the United Nations, Walmart, and a dog breeding association. The Canadian television network CTV reported edits by other organizations including Disney and the Canadian government. On August 24, 2007, headline reports in the Australian print and electronic media were made of anonymous edits to Wikipedia by staff in the Australian Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in order to remove potentially damaging details from articles related to the Government. Information found using WikiScanner showed 126 anonymous edits from the Department to articles on sometimes controversial issues and on government ministers. The Department responded by saying that Prime Minister John Howard did not direct his staff to modify the articles, and later that day the head of the Department said that the changes were not made by anyone in his department or the Prime Minister's office, but by another user with the same Internet Service Provider (ISP). Wikiscanner also identified Australian Department of Defence (DoD) employees as having made over 5,000 edits, prompting an unprecedented announcement from the DoD to block Defence staff from editing Wikipedia in case edits were interpreted as official comment. On August 26, 2007, The Boston Globe in ‚Äúa Globe Editorial‚Äù published an article about Wikipedia, described as a ‚Äúdemocratic fountain of facts‚Äù and related ‚ÄúWikiScanner‚Äù technology, reporting as among those companies found to have edited Wikipedia were Pepsi, Wal-Mart, ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell, in which specific case \\"In 2005, someone using a computer inside Royal Dutch Shell, the oil company, rewrote a benign description of the company, claiming it is 'run by a group of geriatrics who find it impossible to make timely decisions and have an aversion to highly-profitable ventures.'‚Äù The WikiScanner story was also covered by The Independent, which stated that many \\"censorial interventions\\" by editors with vested interests on a variety of articles in Wikipedia had been discovered. On December 18, 2007, Fortune magazine mentioned the use of WikiScanner in the 96th of its list of the \\"101 Dumbest Moments in Business\\" in 2007 saying, \\"A Washington Post employee is found to have changed a reference to the owner of a rival paper from Philip Anschutz to Charles Manson, while someone at The New York Times added the word \\"jerk\\" 12 times to the entry on George W. Bush.\\" During the period of May 27 to June 4, 2008, edits originating from an IP address belonging to Industry Canada were made to the Jim Prentice (Federal Minister of Industry) article on Wikipedia. The edits included the removal of references to new copyright legislation and the addition of two passages about Prentice's recent accomplishments as Minister of Industry. Wikipedia reaction Wikipedia co- founder Jimmy Wales spoke enthusiastically about WikiScanner, noting that \\"It brings an additional level of transparency to what's going on at Wikipedia\\" and that it was \\"fabulous and I strongly support it.\\" The BBC quoted an unnamed Wikipedia spokesperson's praise for the tool in taking transparency \\"to another level\\" and preventing \\"an organisation or individuals from editing articles that they're really not supposed to.\\" In responding to the edits from the Canadian Ministry of Industry, spokesman for the Wikimedia Foundation Jay Walsh noted that neutrality of language and guarding against conflicts of interest are two of the central pillars of Wikipedia, adding that \\"The edits which should be trusted would come from people who don't possess a conflict of interest, in this case, it would be worthwhile saying that if someone is making edits from a computer within the government of Canada ‚Ä¶ if it was someone within that ministry, that would theoretically constitute a conflict of interest.\\" Wales speculated on a possible warning to anonymous editors: \\"When someone clicks on 'edit,' it would be interesting if we could say, 'Hi, thank you for editing. We see you're logged in from The New York Times. Keep in mind that we know that, and it's public information' ‚Ä¶ That might make them stop and think.\\" See also *Reliability of Wikipedia *Seigenthaler incident, the most famous of several scandals involving anonymous hoaxes on Wikipedia *WHOIS *Wiki-Watch References External links  * WikiScanner, Virgil Griffiths page about wikiscanner. * Listen to an RT√â news piece on WikiScanner (RealPlayer required).16 August 2007 * A new website unmasks Wikipedia's vandals - by Michael Agger, Slate.com,24 August 2007 * * How the Wikipedia Scanner Works on howstuffworks.com * wikiwatchdog tests if an organization edits Wikipedia using their IP address * Category:Conflict-of- interest editing on Wikipedia Category:Internet memes Category:Internet privacy Category:Internet Protocol Category:Computer-related introductions in 2007 Category:Wikipedia controversies ","title":"WikiScanner"},{"id":"12765471","text":"Gaston Fonjallaz (born 1903, date of death unknown) was a Swiss bobsledder who competed in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

He was a member of the highly successful and prominent Stroganov family Life A portrait of Sergei Stroganov in his younger years by Pietro de Rossi. A portrait of Sergei Stroganov in his later years by Konstantin Makovsky, 1882 He was born in Saint Petersburg, the capital of the Russian Empire, in 1794 to Baron Grigory Stroganov (1770‚Äì1857) and Princess Anna Trubetskaya (1765‚Äì1824). As a teenager and young adult, he fought for Russia in the Napoleonic Wars and distinguished himself at the Battle of Borodino and at the Battle of Leipzig. In 1815, Stroganov married Natalia Pavlovna Stroganova (1796‚Äì1872), daughter of Sophie Golitsyn, with whom he had four sons and three daughters. Subsequently, Stroganov participated in the Russian-Turkish War of 1828‚Äì1829 and in the Crimean War. Count Stroganov played a large role in the development of the Russian education and culture during the 19th century. In 1825, Stroganov founded the first private academy of art in Russia (in Moscow) using his own money. This art academy taught arts and crafts to 360 people, including to children and serfs. From 1835 until 1847, Stroganov was the curator of the Moscow Educational District, which included Moscow University (now known as Moscow State University) which then flourished as a major center of Russian intellectual life. In 1860, this art academy was renamed the Stroganov School (it is now known as it Stroganov Moscow State University of Arts and Industry), and it produced many prominent architects and artists. From 17 April 1859 to 8 September 1859, Count Stroganov served as Governor-General of Moscow. Starting in 1860, Stroganov was the tutor of Tsesarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich, Emperor Alexander II's eldest son, as well as of the younger sons of Alexander II. Stroganov also served on the State Council of the Russian Empire and was the Chairman of the Society of Russian History and Antiquities between 1837 and 1874, as well as the founder of the Archaeological Commission, which conducted excavations of old Russian towns. As a landowner, Stroganov opposed Tsar Alexander II's emancipation of the Russian serfs in 1861. After the assassination of Alexander II in 1881, Stroganov, along with Konstantin Pobedonostsev and some others, succeeded in convincing the new Russian Tsar, Alexander III, to shelve Count Mikhail Loris-Melikov's proposal for a Russian Duma and constitution. In 1882, Stroganov died in his Saint Petersburg home, age 87.

History Work on a new generation of lightweight rifle using the intermediate 5.56mm round began at SIG in the 1960s and resulted in the somewhat unsuccessful SG 530-1 design that employed a gas-assisted roller-delayed blowback operating mechanism which proved too complicated and expensive to manufacture. As a result, in 1969 SIG chose to dispense with the complex roller-delayed action opting instead for a design using the more robust and simple piston-operated rotating bolt locking mechanism (derived from the Soviet 7.62√ó39mm AK-47 assault rifle). This combination proved successful and the rifle entered production as a family of weapons consisting of the base 5.56mm SG 540, the 7.62mm SG 542 battle rifle and the 5.56mm SG 543 carbine, where both 5.56mm variants were designed for use with 5.56√ó45mm NATO M193 ammunition, while the SG 542‚Äîthe full size 7.62√ó51mm NATO rifle cartridge. Production began between 1973‚Äì1974, but due to Swiss federal restrictions on firearms exportation, manufacturing had to be carried out at the MANURHIN (Manufacture de Machines du Haut Rhin) facility in Mulhouse, France. The SG 540 series has entered service with the armed forces of several countries in Africa, Asia and South America as well as numerous law enforcement and security services. In 1988, the nationally owned Portuguese defense manufacturer INDEP purchased rights to license build the SG 543 carbine for its own forces. Currently the SG 540, SG 542, and the SG 543 are manufactured in Chile, under license by FAMAE for the Chilean Armed Forces. Based on the SG 540, FAMAE developed a 9√ó19mm Parabellum submachine gun version of the weapon known as the SAF. Design details=Operating mechanism SG 543 carbine with stock extended. The SG 540 is an air-cooled, gas-operated, selective fire assault rifle that fires from a closed bolt position. SIG designers used a long-stroke piston-driven action (with the recoil spring wrapped around the piston rod itself) and an adjustable gas regulator with three settings: \\"0\\"‚Äîused to launch rifle grenades, \\"1\\"‚Äîused in normal operating conditions and \\"2\\"‚Äîused in extreme environmental conditions or in the presence of heavy fouling. The firearm is locked into battery by means of a rotating bolt which features two heavy steel locking lugs. The bolt head is rotated by a control cam riding in a helical guide slot machined into the bolt carrier. When a shot is fired, propellant gases from the barrel are fed into the gas cylinder located above the barrel and impart rearward pressure on the piston rod, which drives the bolt carrier back. After a certain amount of free travel built into the system to allow the projectile to depart the barrel, residual gas pressures in the bore drop to a safe level, allowing the breech to be opened. The cam slot in the bolt carrier proceeds to actuate the camming stud in the bolt, rotating the bolt head out of engagement with the locking abutments in the receiver. The spent cartridge casing is extracted by a claw extractor contained in the bolt assembly while a protrusion on one of the internal bolt carrier guide rails in the upper receiver acts as the fixed ejector, removing the casing through a port on the right side of the receiver housing. Features The rifle is hammer-fired and has a fire control selector mechanism that is also the safety (lever in the \\"S\\" position‚Äîindicates the gun is safe, \\"1\\"‚Äîsemi-automatic fire, \\"3\\"‚Äî3-round burst and \\"20\\"‚Äîfully automatic fire). The SG 540 is fed from either 20 or 30-round staggered box magazines. After the last round is fired, a hold-open tab in the magazine engages the bolt catch that locks the bolt in its rear (open) position. A bolt release button is located on the left side of the receiver. The rifled barrel is fitted with a flash suppressor, which is also used to attach rifle grenades and a bayonet. The iron sights consist of a hooded foresight that can be corrected in elevation and an adjustable (windage only), rotating rear drum that contains four apertures with settings for firing at: 100, 300, 400 and 500 m. The receiver top surface can be used to mount adapters enabling the use of optics. The SG 540 series come equipped with either a fixed buttstock or a side-folding metal skeleton stock. Another standard feature is a folding bipod which is stowed under the handguard when not in use. The fixed stock, pistol grip and handguard are all made of high- strength polymers to reduce overall weight. In order to minimize costs, metal stamping was employed in the production process. Variants SG 540-1M upgraded by FAMAE in Chile. Differences between the SG 542 and the SG 540 are mainly the result of adopting a more powerful, full-size rifle cartridge. The SG 542 also uses normally 20/30-round box magazines (5 and 10 magazines were also manufactured) but the sights were modified with a 600 m setting in addition to the 100, 300 and 500 m sight drum positions. The SG 543 carbine is a shortened variant of the SG 540 that has been modified with a short barrel, a shorter gas cylinder and piston rod as well as a different handguard and sights with 100, 200, 300 and 400 m firing range positions. The SG 543 lacks the integral bipod of the SG 540/542 and the reduced barrel cannot be used to fire rifle grenades. The SG 540 served as the basis for the SG 541 prototype, which would later become the SG 550 that entered service with the Swiss Armed Forces as the Stgw 90 (Sturmgewehr 90). Additionally, two semi-automatic variants were manufactured by MANURHIN between the late 1970s and the early 1980s specifically for the European civilian market: called the SIG Manurhin F.S.A. and the SIG Manurhin C.S.A.. These rifles were chambered in .222 Remington and .243 Winchester respectively. Both were available with either 30-round or reduced 5-round magazines, and the option of a folding or fixed stock. The unusual chambering for this type of military-style rifle was an attempt to comply with regulations in certain European countries imposing restrictions on the civilian ownership of \\"military\\" cartridges such as the 5.56√ó45mm NATO/.223 Remington or 7.62√ó51mm NATO/.308 Winchester. SG 542 Made by FAMAE for the Canadian civilian market In Canada, the SG 540 Series rifles are considered \\"non restricted\\", and can thus be used for hunting and varmint/pest control. FAMAE have exported a limited number of semi-automatic only SG 540 (.223) and SG 542 (.308) rifles to civilian firearms owners in Canada, along with a small number of restricted SG 543 (.223) and 9 mm SAF carbines.

Plot In a hospital unit in the U.S. Army in Europe after World War II, Private Hogan does not believe that a blue-stocking can be good- looking, but the first sight of dietetic nurse Lieutenant Betty Bixby sets him straight. When he picks up her cigarette lighter and puts his weapon aside, he is surprised by security officer Paul Locke who admonishes him for putting down his weapon while on guard duty and confines him to quarters preliminary to a court martial. The colonel in charge of the unit, however, would prefer to keep everything \\"in the family\\" and avoid a court martial. Soon, Hogan plans to organise a ball at an off-limits hotel with all the prettiest nurses and his fellow soldiers. Hogan and Cpl. Bohun go through all sorts of mishaps to make sure that the secret Mad Ball goes ahead. Hogan uses a General's X-ray and pretends it belongs to him to win the sympathy of Lt. Bixby, whom he wants to take to the ball. Hogan claims to be suffering from heartburn and an ulcer, and Bixby recommends dietetic changes. When Betty finds out that the X-ray doesn't belong to Hogan, she falls out with him, leaving both Betty and Hogan secretly sad to have lost each other. On the night of the ball, each soldier has been paired with a pretty nurse, except Hogan. He waits for Bixby, hoping that she has forgiven him, but he ends up going to the ball on his own. When he arrives, he sees Betty with the Colonel. She takes off her long coat to reveal a pretty dress. At the end, she shares the last dance with Hogan.

The player takes control of Lockheed's YF-22A Advanced Tactical Fighter (the craft which later became the F-22 Raptor) in a fictional war between two rival factions. The in-game world is a nameless collection of islands, which is randomly generated for each game. The fighter can be armed with a combination of cannon rounds (used to destroy enemy aircraft), ASRAAM missiles, and Maverick missiles for destroying ground targets, even those out of visual range.  Gameplay  In-game screen from the ZX Spectrum version of the game The display is a third-person view showing the player's ATF, which remains stationary on screen as the scenery scrolls past it, which takes up most of the screen. A head-up display is superimposed on the main screen; this shows engine thrust, the ATF's speed, ground height and altitude, along with the missile system available, direction of flight and a target's range and bearing. The right-hand side is devoted to the \\"on-board flight computer\\" which shows enemy positions on a world map, the status of weapon systems and the ATF itself. Above the flight computer display is a panel which shows the score and number of lives left. Below the main display is a panel which displays status reports, and below that indicators for fuel level, enemy missile lock on, \\"terrain following\\" status, \\"automatic landing\\" availability (activated when the ATF enters the catchment area surrounding allied bases), and undercarriage status. The \\"terrain following RADAR\\" prevents the ATF from colliding with the ground but reduces the craft's velocity.  Development  When the game was being written, the YF-22A was not even completed (it had its maiden flight on 1990-09-29) and Lockheed were reluctant to divulge any confidential information. Despite this the developers managed to piece together information about the prototype aircraft's \\"electronic co-pilot\\" and \\"automatic terrain following\\" and decided to concentrate on creating a fast, arcade-like game, with a heavy reliance on strategy, rather than making it technically accurate. Initially the terrain was created by calculating all the visible points for each frame. This system worked but was far too slow to pass as \\"arcade action\\". Instead, a complex co-ordinate referencing system was created, and each frame was drawn into a \\"dummy\\" screen, then copied to the display to avoid flicker. The developers decided that strategy would play a large part in the game, with no compromises being made and that the 'war model' would appear as realistic and natural as possible. Five types of ground forces, as well as sea forces, communications emplacements and factories appear in the game, and all interact with each other in ways that affect gameplay. Factories, for example, supply the military hardware and if destroyed will result in a gradual depletion of forces, since tanks and ships are destroyed but not replaced. The type of terrain affects the velocity of land forces; driving over snow, for example, is twice as slow as over green land. Each object has a unique strength value, which means that if the player does not succeed in completely destroying a target, allied ground forces may be able to \\"finish it off\\". The program code for the Sinclair Spectrum version was written on an IBM AT-compatible computer using a macro assembler, while the graphics were designed on an Atari ST, then downloaded onto the IBM AT, before being downloaded to the Spectrum and debugged using a specially developed monitor.  Reception  Reviews were overwhelmingly positive, with Your Sinclair and Commodore User rating it at 8/10,CRASH at 89%, ACE giving the game 956/1000 and Sinclair User giving top marks of 10/10. Your Sinclair's Jonathan Davies said of the game \\"Flying controls are minimal, leaving your hands free for downing baddies and generally enjoying the flight.\\", Nathan Jones from CRASH decided that \\"...the graphics are superb and the landscapes give it a futuristic feel.\\" and Sinclair User's Chris Jenkins called the game a \\"rivetting shoot-em-up with some aspects of a simulation.\\".

The astronomers use observations and data captured by the Spitzer Space Telescope and other telescopes to create a complete picture of the star forming regions within an approximately 1600 light-year radius centered on the Solar System. These regions are partly or completely clouded by interstellar dust and therefore cannot be observed by telescopes using visible light, like the Hubble Space Telescope. The Gould Belt survey team uses a variety of telescopes and observatories to study multiple aspects of star formation. The Spitzer Space Telescope provides imagery and observations made in the infrared spectrum, while for example the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope provides images from the submillimeter wavelength region of the spectrum. The Herschel Space Observatory telescope provided observation data between the far infrared and the sub-millimeter wavelengths, effectively covering wavelengths between the observational capabilities of the Spitzer and the Maxwell telescopes.  Observation results  Regions surveyed include clouds in Scorpius, Lupus, Musca, Chamaeleon, the Serpens-Aquila Rift and W40, Cepheus, and IC 5146. The first observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope were completed between September 21‚Äì27, 2006. The first region that has been surveyed is IC5146 (the Cocoon Nebula in Cygnus). The first details of the research were presented at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle. Based on these observations, the team of astronomers led by Dr. Robert Gutermuth, of the Harvard‚ÄìSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics reported the discovery of Serpens South, a cluster of 50 young stars in the Serpens constellation.

Abu Madyan Shu øayb ibn al-Husayn al-Andalusi (; c. 1126 ‚Äì 1198 CE), commonly known as Ab≈´ Madyan, was an influential Andalusian mystic and a great Sufi master. Some even refer to him as the national figure of Maghreb mysticism as he was such a forerunner of Sufism in this geographical area. Devoted to the fervent service of God, he helped introduce looking into oneself and harmonizing internal occurrences with the external observances through asceticism.\\"Sidi Boumediene Chouaib, p√¥le du soufisme au Maghreb: Un nom li√© √† la ville ancestrale\\" [\\"Sidi Boumediene Chouaib, center of Sufism in the Maghreb: A name linked to the ancient city\\"] . El Moudjahid (Algiers). 16 April 2011.  Life  Abu Madyan was born in Cantillana, a small town about 35 km away from Seville, in 1126. He came from an obscure family and his parents were poor. As he grew up, he learned the trade of a weaver as it was a popular practice at the time. His insatiable hunger for knowledge, however, piqued his interest in the Qur'an and the study of religion and mysticism. After crossing the Strait of Gibraltar, he worked for a while in Sabta (Ceuta) with fishermen. Afterwards, he went to Marrakesh, where he served in the Almoravid army defending the city. Soon after, Abu Madyan traveled to Fez to complete his education. He left for Fez at about the end of the Almoravid era or at the beginning of the founding of the Almohad state. There, he studied under Abu Ya‚Äôazza al-Hazmiri, ‚ÄòAli Hirzihim, and al-Dakkak. It was al-Dakkak that provided him with the khirka, the cloak passed from Master to student in the study of Sufism. Abu Madyan was particularly fascinated with mysticism by Sidi Ali Ibn Harazem. After finishing his studies with his master Abu Ya'za, he traveled to the Orient. During his time in the Orient, he became familiar with the works of Al-Ghazali, one of the most prominent theologians, philosophers, and mystics of Sunni Islam regarded as one of the renewers of the religion. Abu Madyan went to Mecca where he met the great Muslim saint, Jilani, and completed his spiritual training under him. On his return, he went to the town of B√©ja√Øa where he practiced very strict asceticism and acquired an honorable reputation for his knowledge. People would come far to both listen to his public lectures and consult him on certain manners. People believed he could even perform miracles. His beliefs were in opposition to the Almohade doctors of that town. The Almohads were disturbed at his increasing reputation and wanted to get rid of him. Eventually, Madyan settled in the town of B√©ja√Øa where he established a mosque-school (zawiya). The sheer amount of fame and influence that Abu Madyan evoked raised serious concern from the political powers of the time. The Almohad Caliph Ya‚Äôqub al-Mansur summoned Abu Madyan to Marrakech for this reason so he could talk to Abu Madyan himself. Upon his summoning to Marrakech, Abu Madyan was taken ill and died before he reached his destination in 594/1198, near the river of Ysser (). His last sigh was supposedly \\"Allah al-Hakk.\\" He was buried in al-‚ÄòUbbad near Tlemcen, Algeria. His funeral was widely commemorated by the people of Tlemcen and he has been considered the patron saint and protector of Tlemcen ever since. A mausoleum was built by the order of the Almohade sovereign, Muhammad al-Nasir, too shortly after his death. Many princes and kings of Tlemcen have contributed to this mausoleum since his demise. Many monuments, a good number of them still well preserved, were built in his honor next to his tomb by the Marinid kings, who controlled Tlemcen in the 14th century. One such monument is the Mosque of Madrasa. His tomb became the center of fine architecture and is still a place of pilgrimage for many Sufis today.  Teachings  The basic principles and virtues taught at Madyan‚Äôs school in Bejaia were repentance (tawba), asceticism (zuhd), paying visits to other masters, and service to experienced masters. He emphasized futuwa (youth/chivalry) but only when accompanied by the obedience of devotees to their master, the avoidance of disagreements between devotees, justice, constancy, nobility of mind, the denunciation of the unjust, and a feeling of satisfaction with the gifts of God. Because of his focus on the acceptance of one‚Äôs emotions, Madyan and his followers refused to confine themselves to only asceticism and meditation alone, but instead lived day to day by maintaining close relationships with the people around them. Along with sharing his knowledge and ideas with his disciples, Abu Madyan wrote many poems and spoke in proverbs in order to connect with the masses and not just the intellectuals. According to Yahya B. Khaldun, Abu Madyan's teachings may all be summed up in this verse which he often repeated, \\"Say Allah! and abandon all that is matter, or is connected with it, if though desirest to attain the truth goal.\\"  Legacy  Aside from attaining Ghawth status and teaching hundreds and hundreds of disciples, Abu Madyan left his mark in more ways than one. He gained immense popularity because he was relatable, despite his high scholarly status. He had a personality and way of speaking that united people from all walks of life, from the common people to the academics. Even to this day, scholars say that no one of the time surpassed him in religious and intellectual influence. His school produced hundreds of saints and out of the 46 Sufi saints in the Rif region, 15 were his disciples. People still visit his tomb today for asking god through him they call it tawasoul, they visit him from all around the world.  Sayings  There are very few surviving writings from Abu Madyan, and of those that do still exist, there are mystical poems, a testament (wasiyya) and a creed (akida). He encouraged the free expression of emotions rather than rigidity, but also made known his support of asceticism complete devotion to God and a minimalist lifestyle.

In 1934, flying in Faith in Australia, Ulm carried the first official airmail from New Zealand to Australia, and the first official airmail delivery from Australia to Papua New Guinea.Ellen Rogers collection highlight: National Museum of Australia Ulm established a new company in September 1934, Great Pacific Airways Ltd, intending to operate a San Francisco-Sydney air service. Ulm disappeared in December 1934, together with the copilot and navigator. An unexpected tailwind and bad weather caused them to fly past the Hawaiian islands in the dark. The wind was about 35 knots from the south-southeast and the aircraft may also have been pushed north of the islands.Clarence S. Williams, \\"What Happened Littlejohn and navigator/radio operator J.S. Skilling, on a test flight from Oakland, California to Hawaii in VH-UXY Stella Australis, an Airspeed Envoy. It is believed an to Ulm,\\" Los Angeles Times Sunday Magazine, 30 December 1934 At about 10 am local time on 3 December, after sending a series of Morse coded radio messages to Hawaii over five hours advising that they were lost and running out of fuel, the Envoy ditched into the sea. Despite an extensive and immediate search by aircraft and 23 naval ships, no trace of Stella Australis or her crew was ever found. Ulm had chosen not to carry a life raft on board, preferring to save weight and predicting that the aircraft would float for two days if it were forced to land on the water. The plane had been customized by Airspeed to meet Ulm's own specifications; Airspeed's manager, Nevil Shute Norway, suggested in his autobiography that the internal cabin design may have contributed to the navigational problems, because the inexperienced navigator/wireless operator (who had been a ship's officer) had to sit in the rear compartment behind the large petrol tank and some distance from the pilot. Ulm communicated by speaking tube but could not see the charts or calculations (this arrangement had been chosen by Ulm instead of having the navigator in the cramped space in front of the tank with the pilot and co- pilot).Nevil Shute, Slide Rule, p 200 Tributes In 1978 he was honoured on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post depicting Ulm and the Southern Cross.http://www.australianstamp.com/images/large/0012170.jpg In November 2008 Qantas announced that it would be naming one of its Airbus A380s after Charles Ulm in recognition of his contribution to the aviation industry.

Libya under King Idris signed the Nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1968 and Gaddafi ratified it in 1975, and concluded a safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1980.GOV/2004/12, Implementation of the NPT Safeguards Agreement of the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, Report by the Director General, International Atomic Energy Agency, 20 February 2004. The United States and the United Kingdom assisted Libya in removing equipment and material from its nuclear weapons program, with independent verification by IAEA. In 1982 Libya ratified the Biological Weapons Convention, and in 2004 it acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention,The Chemical Weapons Convention Enters Into Force in Libya, Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, 2 February 2004. and declared 24.7 metric tonnes of mustard gas, 1,390 metric tonnes of chemical precursors for making sarin, as well as 3,563 unloaded chemical weapon munitions (aerial bombs).OPCW, Libya: Facts and Figures The OPCW set January 2014 as the deadline for the full destruction of Libya's chemical weapons. Libya began destroying its chemical stockpiles and munitions later in 2004, but it missed deadlines for converting one chemical weapons production facility to peaceful use and for destroying its stockpile of mustard agent. In October 2014, Libya asked for foreign assistance to transport its 850 tonne stockpile of precursor chemicals for making nerve gas out of Libya for destruction. In February 2015, Libyan military sources told media that unidentified armed men had captured large amounts of Libya‚Äôs chemical weapons, including mustard gas and sarin. Destruction of Libya's chemical weapon precursors was completed in November 2017. Nuclear program King Idris of Libya signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in July 1968. In 1969, Muammar Gaddafi seized control of Libya and had ambitions to acquire nuclear weapons. Before the rollback of its clandestine nuclear program from late 2003, Libya had a nuclear weapons program, allegedly to counter the covert Israeli nuclear program. Gaddafi ratified NPT in 1975, and concluded the safeguards agreement with the IAEA in 1980. In 1981, the Soviet Union completed a 10 MW research reactor at Tajura. Libya purchases more than 2,000 tons of lightly processed uranium from Niger. During the 1980s, Gaddafi had reportedly used illicit nuclear proliferation networks and various black market sources, including Swiss nuclear engineer Friedrich Tinner, to start developing the nuclear weapons. The IAEA reported that, in July 1995, Libya had made a ‚Äústrategic decision to reinvigorate its nuclear activities, including gas centrifuge uranium enrichment,‚Äù which can enrich uranium for use in nuclear reactors as well as for fissile material in nuclear weapons. However, at the time its nuclear program was rolled back by Gaddafi (with assistance from the United States and the IAEA), Libya's nuclear program remained in very early initial, developmental stages.  Foreign assistance  Gaddafi‚Äòs most famous buying foray for nuclear weapons was in 1970, when Libyan leaders paid a state visit to China. Gaddafi and his Prime Minister Abdessalam Jalloud made an unsuccessful attempt to convince China to sell tactical nuclear weapons to Libya. In a bilateral meeting with Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, Gaddafi unsuccessfully attempted to convince Zhou to sell him a nuclear bomb. Gaddafi's justification for seeking nuclear weapons was his concern over the Israeli nuclear capability, and publicly expressed his desire to obtain nuclear weapons. After being invited by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to attend the 2nd OIC conference (OIC) in Lahore, Libya negotiated and was delegated to participate in its nuclear program, Project-706, in 1974. In 1977, Libyan technicians left for Pakistan but by the time Libyans joined the program, the martial law had come in effect against Bhutto in response to end the political deadlock. Before Pakistan's A-bomb project succeeded, Libya had been taken out of the equation as the new President General Zia-ul-Haq had distrusted and strongly disliked Gaddafi. On immediate effects, Libyans were asked to leave the country and the Libyan Intelligence made attempts to infiltrate Pakistan's high-powered research institutes, but such attempts were thwarted by ISI who intercepted and arrested these Libyan agents. Investigators have found that nuclear weapons designs obtained by Libya through a Pakistani smuggling network originated in China. With relations severed with Pakistan, Gaddafi normalized relations with India in 1978, and Gaddafi reached a mutual understanding with India for civil nuclear cooperation, as part of India's Atoms for Peace program. With the Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi visiting Libya in 1984, a nuclear energy pact was signed by Libya and India, but it is unclear how much interaction and cooperation took place. Throughout the 1980s, Libyan efforts continued to push for acquiring nuclear weapons from various sources. In an ingenious persuasion to uranium enrichment in 1978, Libya made an effort to gain access to uranium ore, uranium conversion facilities, and enrichment techniques that together would have enabled Libya to produce weapons-grade uranium. The approach failed in 1979, and in 1980 Libya decided to pursue a plutonium-based pathway to nuclear weapons. Libya imported 1,200 tons of uranium ore concentrate from French-controlled mines in Niger without declaring it to the IAEA, as required by its safeguards agreement. In 1982, Libya attempted to enter in an agreement with Belgium for purchasing a small plant for manufacturing UF4. At the time, Libya had no declared nuclear facilities that required UF4, and the purchase was refused. In 1980, Libya began to build its nuclear infrastructure from various nuclear black market sources. The centrifuges materials and expertise were provided by Swiss national, Friedrich Tinner. Tinner's work on centrifuges took place at the TNRF aimed at producing gas centrifuges for uranium enrichment. By the late 1980s, financial constraints and economic sanctions were imposed by the United States in the 1980s, further hampering the nuclear program. Work was completed by Tinner in 1992, but Libya remained unable to produce an operating centrifuge. After the end of Cold War, Gaddafi bluntly persuaded the U.S. President Bill Clinton to uplift the sanctions by allowing the disarmament of its nuclear program.The Iraq War did not Force Gadaffi's Hand  Brookings Institution In 1995, Gaddafi renewed calls for nuclear weapons and pursued new avenues for nuclear technology procurement, while publicizing the NPT.Joshua Sinai, \\"Libya's Pursuit of Weapons of Mass Destruction,\\" Nonproliferation Review 4, Spring-Summer 1997, p. 97. In 1997, Libya received technical documentation and materials on gas centrifuges from various sources, as Libya had made a strategic decision to start the program with a new attitude. Libya employed a large number of black market network, first reeving the 20 pre-assembled centrifuges and components for an additional 200 centrifuges and related parts from foreign suppliers. The pre- assembled rotors for centrifuges were used to install a completed single centrifuge at the Al Hashan site, which was first successfully tested in October 2000. In 2000, Libya accelerated its efforts, still headed by Tinner. Libya received many documents on the design and operation of centrifuges, but the program suffered many setbacks in evaluating these designs as they were too difficult to interpret and bring into operation. Libya ultimately told IAEA investigators that it had no national personnel competent to evaluate these designs at that time, and due to its extreme difficulty, Libya would have had to ask the supplier for help if it had decided to pursue a nuclear weapon. =Soviet Union= In 1979, Libya pursued peaceful nuclear cooperation with the Soviet Union, under IAEA safeguards. In 1981, the Soviet Union agreed to build a 10 MW research reactor at Tajoura, under IAEA safeguards. The Libyan nuclear program repeatedly suffered under mismanagement and loss of academic generation. The Tajura facility was run under the Soviet experts and staffed by a small number of inexperienced Libyan specialists and technicians. Known as the Tajura Nuclear Research Facility (TNRF), Libya conducted illegal uranium conversion experiments there. An unnamed nuclear weapon state, whose name has been kept secret by the IAEA, also allegedly assisted Libya in these experiments. Nuclear expert David Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security said the Soviet Union and China were the most likely suspects. In 1984, Libya negotiated with the Soviet Union for a supply of nuclear power plants, but its out-of-date technology dissatisfied Colonel Gaddafi. Gaddafi negotiated with Belgium but the talks failed. In 1984, Libya negotiated with Japan for a pilot-scale uranium conversion facility. A Japanese company supplied Libya with the technology, and the sale was apparently arranged directly with the Japanese instead of through middlemen. In 1991, Libya tried to exploit the chaos generated by the collapse of the Soviet Union to gain access to nuclear technology, expertise, and materials. In 1992, it was reported by an official of the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow claimed that Libya had unsuccessfully tried to recruit two of his colleagues to work at the Tajoura Nuclear Research Center in Libya. Other reports also suggested that Russian scientists had been hired to work on a covert Libyan nuclear program.jack Kelley, \\"Russian Nuke Experts Wooed,\\" USA Today, 8 January 1992; \\"Libya Denies Offers to Soviets,\\" Washington Post, 11 January 1992. In March 1998, Russia and Libya signed a contract with the Russian consortium, the Atomenergoeksport for a partial overhaul of the Tajoura Nuclear Research Center.Joseph Cirincione with Jon B. Wolfsthal and Miriam Rajkumar, Deadly Arsenals: Tracking Weapons of Mass Destruction (Washington, DC: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2002), p. 307. Dismantlement The Clinton administration diplomat, Martin Indyk, maintained that the negotiations and diplomatic efforts rolling back Libyan nuclear program were started as early as Bill Clinton assuming the presidency in the 1990s. Chemical weapons Libya under Gaddafi actively maintained a chemical weapons program, which was ostensibly decommissioned in the 2000s and early 2010s as Gaddafi sought to normalise relations with the Western world. Libya acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention with effect on 5 February 2004, and declared 24.7 metric tonnes of mustard gas, 1,390 metric tonnes of chemical precursors for making sarin, as well as 3,563 unloaded chemical weapon munitions (aerial bombs). The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) supervised the destruction of Libya's chemical weapons caches through February 2011, when it was forced to suspend its operations due to the uprising against Gaddafi and the resulting deterioration of the country's stability. By then, Libya had destroyed 40% of its precursor materials and 55% of its mustard gas, as well as 3,500 chemical weapon munitions.Nuclear Threat Initiative, 30 September 2011, Senate Delegation Positive About Security of Libyan WMD Materials In early September 2011, OPCW Director-General Ahmet √úz√ºmc√º said reports he had received indicated that the remaining weapons were secure and had not fallen into the hands of militant groups. A stockpile of mustard gas, which the OPCW reported the regime may have attempted to hide from inspectors overseeing the chemical weapons program's dismantlement, was reportedly found in the Jufra District by anti- Gaddafi fighters less than two weeks later. In late September it was reported by the Wall Street Journal that a major ammunition complex, including chemical-weapons-capable artillery shells, was unguarded and open to looting.Nuclear Threat Initiative, 3 October 2011, Libyan Weapons Depot Unguarded, Open to Looters In December 2012 a senior Spanish intelligence official said that Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb \\"probably also has non- conventional arms, basically chemical, as a result of the loss of control of arsenals\\", with Libya the most likely source.Daily Telegraph, 10 December 2012, Al Qaeda may have chemical weapons, Spain's counter-terror chief warns Libya's National Transitional Council cooperated with the OPCW in the destruction of the remaining chemical weapons.Libya's NTC pledges to destroy chemical weapons: OPCW After assessing the chemical stockpiles, the OPCW set a deadline for the destruction of the weapons by the Libyan government.Chemical weapons inspectors to return to Libya As at September 2013, 1.6 metric tons of mustard blister agent loaded in artillery rounds, 2.5 metric tons of congealed mustard agent, and 846 metric tons of chemical weapons ingredients remained to be destroyed. According to The New York Times, on February 2014, the remnants of Libya's chemical weapons had been discreetly destroyed by the United States and Libya, using a transportable oven technology to destroy hundreds of bombs and artillery rounds filled with deadly mustard agent. In September 2014, OPCW said Libya still had around 850 tonnes of industrial chemicals that could be used to produce chemical weapons. In October 2014, Libya asked for foreign assistance to transport that stockpile of raw materials for making nerve gas out of Libya for destruction. On 5 February 2015, the Libyan Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Director-General of OPCW agreed on the need to complete the destruction of the remaining precursor chemicals. On 21 February 2015, Asharq Al-Awsat reported that an anonymous Libyan army official stated extremists had seized large amounts of Gaddafi‚Äôs chemical weapons from multiple locations. The official warned that the targeted caches included mustard gas and sarin. The North Africa Post later reported that chemical weapons were stolen by armed men who stormed the chemical factory in the Jufra district where the weapons were stored. Military sources reportedly stated that among the chemical weapons are mustard gas and sarin. On 31 August 2016, the last stockpile of ingredients for chemical weapons in the country was removed to Germany to avoid it falling into the hands of militants and was slated for destruction. Destruction of Libya's chemical weapon precursors was completed in November 2017. Ballistic missiles Ranges of Rodong-1, Taepodong-1 and Taepodong-2 Libyan Army forces loyal to Gaddafi reportedly fired several Scud-B surface-to-surface missiles at areas in revolt against the regime, including Misrata and Ajdabiya, during the Libyan Civil War, but the weapons missed their targets. Several more Scuds, with launchers, were found by anti-Gaddafi fighters near Tripoli and Sirte.

History  The Pie Rouge des Plaines is a modern breed. In 1970, farmers raising the traditional red-pied Armorican cattle in the three western d√©partements of Brittany ‚Äì C√¥tes-d'Armor, Finist√®re and the Morbihan ‚Äì took the decision to merge their breed with red-pied cattle of Germany and the Netherlands, through a programme of extensive cross-breeding with German Rotbunt and Dutch Meuse-Rhine-Yssel stock, to create a new dairy breed with good meat-producing qualities. A breeders' association, the Eleveurs de la Race Fran√ßaise Pie Rouge des Plaines, was formed, and a herd-book was opened for the new breed in 1970 or 1971. From 1982 an attempt was made to increase size and udder quality by introducing Red Holstein blood; however, the resulting stock was less successful for beef production. The Pie Rouge des Plaines is concentrated mainly in Brittany, where about 80% of the total herd is found; it is also distributed in Normandy, and ‚Äì to a lesser extent ‚Äì in the Massif Central. The total population is estimated at about , with approximately cows registered in the herd-book. Frozen semen from some 150 bulls is available for artificial insemination. The original Armorican breed has become rare: it was listed by the FAO as \\"critically endangered\\" in 2007. In 2005, the population was estimated at about 240 head, and in 2014 it was 263.  Characteristics  The Pie Rouge des Plaines is red-pied, with short crescent-shaped horns. The skin, muzzle and mucosa are pale. Cows have good resistance to mastitis.  Use  Pie Rouge des Plaines has good dairy aptitude. Milk yield is of the order of in a lactation of 329 days. The milk has 4.3% fat and 3.3% protein. Meat production also contributes to profitability.

In a racing career which lasted from June 2005 until December 2007, he ran twenty times and won ten races. After winning two minor races in 2005 he improved to become one of the leading European three-year-olds of 2006, winning the Irish Derby and the Irish Champion Stakes as well as finishing a close third in The Derby. In 2007 he won three of Europe's most important weight-for-age races, taking the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot, a second Irish Champion Stakes and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp. His performances led to his being named European Horse of the Year in 2007. Background Dylan Thomas is a bay horse bred in Ireland by Tower Bloodstock. He was trained in Ireland by Aidan O'Brien and owned by Sue Magnier and Michael Tabor. He was sired by Danehill out of Lagrion, a daughter of Diesis. Dylan Thomas is a half brother to the 2001 European champion two-year-old filly, Queen's Logic and to the 2012 1000 Guineas winner Homecoming Queen. Racing career=2005: two-year-old season Dylan Thomas made his first racecourse appearance in a maiden race at Tipperary on 30 June. Ridden by Kieren Fallon, he started even money favourite and won by a length from Galantas. He was off the racecourse until 10 September when he ran in the Irish Breeders' Foal Levy Stakes at Leopardstown. He took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won by three quarters of a length from Royal Power despite hanging badly to the right in the closing stages. Dylan Thomas was then sent to England to contest the Group Three Autumn Stakes at Salisbury on 8 October. Ridden by Johnny Murtagh, he started 13/8 favourite, but after leading briefly in the straight he finished second by a neck to Blitzkrieg. The future Dubai World Cup winner Well Armed finished fourth. Three weeks later, Dylan Thomas was moved up to Group One class for the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster. He made little impression and finished sixth of the seven runners behind Palace Episode. 2006: three- year-old season Dylan Thomas made his three-year-old debut in the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial over ten furlongs at Leopardstown on 14 May. Ridden by Seamie Heffernan he took the lead early in the straight and stayed on strongly to win from his stable companion Mountain and the English challenger Youmzain. On 3 June, he lined up for The Derby. Ridden by Johnny Murtagh, he was sent to the lead after half a mile and stayed there until headed on the line by winner Sir Percy and runner-up Dragon Dancer. He subsequently won the Irish Derby at the Curragh, ridden by Kieren Fallon. After a summer break, Dylan Thomas beat Ouija Board in a thrilling finish to the Irish Champion Stakes in September. In late September 2006, Coolmore took the unusual step of sending Dylan Thomas to run in the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park, his first (and only) race on dirt where he raced against top US dirt 3yo Bernardini. He never took to the surface and struggled from the break, trailing in a distant last. 2007: four-year-old season As a four- year-old in 2007, Dylan Thomas won the Prix Ganay at Longchamp in France, and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot, the latter under Johnny Murtagh. On 8 September 2007 he became the first two-time winner of the Irish Champion Stakes and rider Kieren Fallon became the first jockey to win the race three times in succession. He crowned this season with a win in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe on soft ground. The victory stood after a half-hour stewards enquiry into interference was caused because Dylan Thomas veered sharply to the right halfway up the home straight, thereby coming across two other runners. Prior to this race, Fallon had described Dylan Thomas as the best horse he had ever ridden. After the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, Dylan Thomas was entered in the John Deere Breeders' Cup Turf, but he did not contend. After he was withdrawn from the Japan Cup, his last race was the Hong Kong Vase, in which he finished 7th. Dylan Thomas retired to Coolmore Stud in Ireland before the end of the year. He raced for Michael Tabor and Susan Magnier, whose husband, John Magnier, is Coolmore's managing partner. Assessment Dylan Thomas was named Horse of the Year at the annual Irish Horse Racing Awards in the Shelbourne Hotel, Dublin on Monday 10 December 2007.[3] Stud career He was retired at the end of 2007 and now stands as a \\"shuttle stallion\\" for Coolmore, serving mares at the main Coolmore farm in Ireland during the Northern Hemisphere breeding season and at Coolmore's Australia farm during the Southern Hemisphere breeding season. The most successful of his first crop of foals was the German-trained 4 year old filly Nymphea who won the Group One Grosser Preis von Berlin in 2013. In May 2014, Dylan Thomas added two more major successes as Dylan Mouth won the Derby Italiano and Blazing Speed won Hong Kong Champions & Chater Cup. In 2015 Pether's Moon won the Coronation Cup. In 2018, Ladies First won the Auckland Cup. Pedigree *Like all of Danehill's offspring Dylan Thomas is inbred 4x4 to the mare Natalma.

He was educated at Highgate School. Sargant, for much of his life a businessman and politician, became increasingly concerned with the impact of the law and legal services upon ordinary people. In the mid-1950s, he was asked to help mobilise lawyers in support of those accused in treason trials in Hungary and South Africa, and JUSTICE was set up as a result. Tom Sargant became its first Secretary and was a driving force of the organisation until his retirement in 1982. As a result of his commitment, persistence and determination, JUSTICE played a key role in taking up the cause of miscarriage of justice cases. Sargant's tireless campaigning resulted in some 25 people being released, or released early, from prison. He was instrumental in the establishment of the BBC series Rough Justice, which led to the release of 18 victims of miscarriages of justice. He also played a major role in bringing about other key measures such as the creation of the office of Ombudsman and the establishment of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. In 1966 he was awarded an OBE and became a JP. He was made Honorary Master of Laws at Queen's University Belfast in 1977. In 1989 the first Thomas Sargant Memorial Lecture was given in his memory and has been given every year since. The lectures are organised by JUSTICE. Tom Sargant's daughter was the educationalist Naomi Sargant (1933‚Äì2006).

Pieter van Woensel (Haarlem, 1747 ‚Äì The Hague, 1808) was a physician, adventurer, travel writer, navy medical officer, political cartoonist and a colourful, atheist author under the Turkish pseudonym Amurath-Effendi Hekim- Bachi (‚ÄòChief Physician Mister Amurath‚Äô) in the satirical almanac de Lantaarn (the Lamp). Typical for Van Woensel is his love for the peculiar, dislike for the easy route and inborn tendency towards the paradoxical. Life Van Woensel was a student at the Leiden University. In 1771 he left for Saint Petersburg as an army physician. For an appointment at the Hospital of the Petersburg Cadets he had Jan Hendrik van Kinsbergen to thank. In 1780, he returned to Amsterdam. His brief communications in 1780 and 1782 on his findings of improving the treatment of whooping cough (in young Russian cadets) continued to be cited in the specialist literature well into the 1830s. In 1781, he published the Present State of Russia, a book that was translated in French, German, Polish, Italian and Russian. In 1782, he published Pr√©cis, a much reworked French summary of Abbot Raynal‚Äôs Histoire des deux Indes, followed by a further abridged and paraphrased Dutch version, as Tafreel, in 1784. Curiously, he appears to have removed all its content regarding anti-colonialism and the abolition of slavery.Analysis in Laban Kaptein (ed.) Pieter van Woensel, Remarks (2015), Commentary (Part II), pp. 42-44. Unrest drove him and in 1784, he spent one and a half years in Constantinople and published on Turkish society in 1791, an important reason why his work caused so much interest. He joined a group of Englishmen travelling to India, via Bagdad, but already in Diyarbakƒ±r he decided to travel by himself, because the company bored him. After a stay in Erzurum, he crossed the Pontic Mountains in bad weather, and spent several days in plague- ridden Trabzon on the Black Sea, before sailing to the Crimea, where he settled in Sevastopol for two years as navy doctor in Russian service.For the stages of Van Woensel‚Äôs itinerary, see map in Bakker, Reizen (2008), pp. 140-141. He describes the visit of Catharina II of Russia at the newly conquered territory. His research on the plague appeared in French in St. Petersburg (1788), and was translated into Russian by Andrej Kazimirovitsj Mejer (Moscow, 1791). Later, in Aanteekeningen (Remarks) he went one step further, elaborating on the fundamental natural law of self-preservation. To deter the superior Russians, the Turks, thus Van Woensel, were allowed to threaten biological warfare, in the form of deliberately spreading the plague.Aanteekeningen (Remarks) vol. 1 (1791), pp. 355-372. Back in Amsterdam, he was appointed naval-physician to the Admiralty of Amsterdam. Van Woensel travelled as a ship doctor with the fleet to Surinam, Demerara and Berbice. His typically Woenselian, sometimes acrid account of local (slavery) conditions in De Lantaarn voor 1796 acquired lasting notoriety in Surinamica. In 1797, he travelled again to Russia as a secret agent, seeing the coronation of Paul I of Russia on 5 April. In his almanac Van Woensel wrote in favour of a divorce procedure and, an atheist himself, a healthy dose of self-reflection regarding Muslims and Jews. (Nevertheless, though feeling that the Turks, among all nations, treated Jews 'the most christianly,' he found that non- Muslims living under the Turks were ‚Äòkept in utter abasement, [and] are basically treated like dogs.‚Äô) Van Woensel, De Lantaarn voor 1792, pp. 122, 125, and M√©moire sur la peste, p. 17. He states that the prime function of the state is to provide work for its inhabitants. The almanac was banned because he wrote under a pseudonym, banned since the state regulation of 1798. Apart from his work on Raynal, he also translated Thomas Paine, The decline and fall of the English system of finance into Dutch, as De daaling en val van het systhema der Engelsche finanti√´n (1796). Nieuwenhuis, Satire (2014), pp. 111-112. In 1802, Van Woensel, a Cervantista by his own admission, published a much abridged and reworked Dutch version (based on a hitherto unknown source) of Don Quixote. With illustrations assumed to be by his own hand, and written in modern, lively Dutch, it finally replaced Lambert van den Bosch‚Äôs antiquated classic after almost 150 years. In 1804 his Rusland beschouwd (Russia considered...) was published. Van Woensel called a spade a spade and uttered his opinions on slavery and serfdom. He was critical of Russian policies carried out by Grigori Potemkin, a wind bag according to Van Woensel.

It is Web-based server software which features course management, customizable open architecture, and scalable design that allows integration with student information systems and authentication protocols. It may be installed on local servers or hosted by Blackboard ASP Solutions. Its main purposes are to add online elements to courses traditionally delivered face-to-face and to develop completely online courses with few or no face-to- face meetings. History On January 21, 1997, Stephen Gilfus and Daniel Cane started a company called CourseInfo LLC and were developing a software product that would power online education and be scalable for wider institutional application. , The Blackboard Learning System. At the same time, Matthew Pittinsky and Michael Chasen formed Blackboard LLC and were contracted to help lead the formation of the Educause IMS standards group for online education technology. The two groups merged to form Blackboard Inc., which then developed the Blackboard Learning System. In May 2009 Blackboard learn purchased the privately held competing learning management systems company Angel Learning, inc. ANGEL Learning In 2015, the company announced a major upgrade to the user experience, called Ultra. According to company statements, Ultra is to be an optional user interface sitting on top of the existing Learn 9.1 architecture. In October 2017, Blackboard partnered with OpenEd to integrate OER with Learning Management Systems. Blackboard Learn provides users with a platform for communication and sharing content.  Communication  *Announcements: Professors and teachers may post announcements for students to read.

In addition, a number of educational institutions,\\"Blackboard catastrophic system crash in Utah\\" teachers,\\"Great Blackboard Crash of 2009\\"\\"Protesting Blackboard 8.0\\"\\"WTF University Meets Blackboard\\"\\"Oh, Blackboard, Wherefore Do I Hate Thee?\\" and students\\"Glitches in new Blackboard system a hassle\\"\\"Blackboard 9: Enough is Enough\\"\\"'Official' I Freaking Hate Blackboard thread\\" have expressed concerns about the reliability of Blackboard. McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, has replaced their Blackboard system after multiple problems during one year of use. Citing numerous glitches and high costs, many universities are turning to the cheaper, open source alternative Moodle, including Montana State University, Vassar College, California State University, Long Beach, and many other schools. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's implementation of the system notably suffered sporadic outages in the Grade Book section during the finals of the Fall 2014 semester. In Spring 2020, during coronavirus pandemic, Fairfax County Public Schools, one of the largest school system in the United States with 189 thousand students abandoned Blackboard Learn 24/7 after weeks of unsuccessful attempts to use it. The issues included, poor security allowing live instructions to be hacked and disrupted and inability for the system to cope with the volume even on the days when only elementary schools were using the system.

As a narrative device, mind control serves as a convenient means of introducing changes in the behavior of characters, and is used as a device for raising tension and audience uncertainty in the contexts of the Cold War and terrorism. Mind control has often been an important theme in science fiction and fantasy stories. Terry O'Brien comments: \\"Mind control is such a powerful image that if hypnotism did not exist, then something similar would have to have been invented: the plot device is too useful for any writer to ignore. The fear of mind control is equally as powerful an image.\\"Terry O'Brien in The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders, Volume 1, Gary Westfahl editor, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005 Science fiction * In Dragon Ball, Broly is mind- controlled by his father Paragus. * In Warhammer 40,000, the T'au Empire is mind-controlling its population. * Imperio, one of the three Unforgivable Curses in Harry Potter, is a spell used for mind control. * In RoboCop, the titular character is mind-controlled by Raymond Sellars. * In Gamer, death-row prisoners are mind-controlled by gamers in Slayers, a first-person shooter. * In DC Comics, Brainiac and Poison Ivy are frequently using mind control, an ability that Darkseid also plans to obtain by seeking the Anti-Life Equation. * In Danny Phantom, Vlad Plasmius used mind control to become a billionaire. * In Yu-Gi-Oh!, Shadi has the Millenium Key, one of the seven Millenium Items, which provides its owner with the mind control ability. * In the movie series Men in Black, a device used for memory erasing (known as the Neuralyzer) is used frequently by Agents Kay and Jay. * In the television series Doctor Who, there are multiple stories involving mind control. **The Master is able to control the minds of individuals with a weak will by looking into their eyes, a form of hypnosis. In The Sound of Drums he is able to do this on a massive scale through the Archangel satellite network, but this backfires when the Doctor manages to use the network to defeat him. **In Rise of the Cybermen and The Age of Steel, EarPods are devices that can place the user into a trance- state and download information directly into their brain, as well as other features such as communication. EarPods are widely used in a parallel universe, worn in both ears. Unbeknownst to the users, the EarPods could also mind control as the population's EarPods were activated and controlled them to walk to a conversion factory and be converted into Cybermen. **A similar method of control by the Cybermen reappears in Army of Ghosts. Workers at the Torchwood Institute wore a communication earpiece. As some workers were captured by the Cybermen, their earpieces were manipulated to control them with the worker reemerging with an earpiece in each ear. It was later found that the earpieces were connected to the brain through artificial tissue. * In the Anthony Burgess novel A Clockwork Orange, later adapted into a film by Stanley Kubrick, the \\"Ludovico Technique\\" is a form of mind control that causes the subject, in this case the thug anti-hero Alex, to feel sickness and pain whenever he has a violent or anti-social impulse. This backfires because of Alex's association with the music of Ludwig van Beethoven to ultraviolence, an unintended side effect means that he has the same physical reaction to the music alone, which is exploited later by a man whose wife Alex had raped. * * Mind control (telepathic hypnosis) is a prominent psionic gift in the Scanners series of films. It is used by the Scanners to escape imprisonment in the first film, and to sometimes control others in the subsequent films. * * George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four features a description of mind control, both directly by torture, and indirectly, in the form of pervasive mind control by the use of Newspeak, a constructed language designed to remove the possibility, Sapir-Whorf-wise of articulating or of even thinking subversive thoughts. * * The Jedi mind trick is a prominent plot device in the Star Wars saga. * * In The Matrix, a chemical was injected into Morpheus to make him reveal access codes. * * In Michael Crichton's novel The Terminal Man, the Terminal Man has doctors implant a simple computer into the brainstem of a man who suffers from impulsive violence. The plan is to stimulate certain nerves to ease the violent impulses. Instead, the violence becomes even more irresistible. * * In the anime, movie and video game series Street Fighter 2, the main villain, known as M. Bison uses his \\"Psycho Power\\" to brainwash and corrupt street fighters across the world into joining his criminal organization known as Shadowloo, turning them into remorseless killing machines fully under his control. * * In the X-Men comic book series, Professor Xavier, can read and control people's minds. Mind control and other psychic abilities are relatively common mutations in the X-Men universe; other people with this ability include Emma Frost and, to a lesser degree, Jean Grey. * * The House of the Scorpion is a science fiction book in which people have computer chips implanted in their brain, allowing them to only do what they are 'programmed' to do. These people are referred to as 'Eejits'. * * In the anime series, Code Geass, the protagonist, Lelouch Lamperouge, gets the ability, Geass, which gives him a form of mind control by allowing him to give someone an absolute order, by looking them in the eye. * * In the film Control Factor, an unsuspecting \\"everyman\\" slowly realizes he is an unwitting guinea pig being used in a mind control test. If successful, the test will then expand to behavioral control of an entire population. * * In the Resident Evil films, based on the video game series of the same name, the fictional Umbrella Corporation captures and brainwashes the protagonist, Alice (portrayed by Milla Jovovich), as part of their \\"Program: Alice\\" experiment. * * In the Bionicle storyline, a Kanohi mask called Komau allows the user the power to control minds of beings. * * In John Christopher's Tripods trilogy, the alien Masters control all of humanity via devices called Caps which are permanently affixed to the skull. The Caps received signals broadcast by equipment in the Masters' cities. * * In Empire of the Ants, giant ants used a white gas to control the minds of humans. * * In Stargate SG-1, the Goa'uld had brainwashing technology that is used several times over the show and proves both easy and difficult to defeat depending on what technique is used. * * In Stargate Universe, using presumably left-over Goa'uld technology, the Lucian Alliance are able to brainwash their enemies into becoming spies for them as they do with Colonel David Telford. This brainwashing is difficult to break as shown with Telford: the characters were forced to evacuate the air in the room he was in, let him die for a short period of time then revive him. Those brainwashed are shown to remember their actions as Telford remembers everything he did. * * In Star Trek: The Next Generation, there are at least three episodes featuring Mind Control: **In \\"The Mind's Eye\\", Geordi La Forge is brainwashed into becoming an assassin by the Romulans to reignite hostilities between The Federation and the Klingon Empire. The depiction of brainwashing in the episode relies upon feeding images and impulses directly into La Forge's cortex via his VISOR interface. **In \\"The Game\\", the crew of the Enterprise is controlled using a device that has the user playing a simple 3D game and provides direct stimulation to the pleasure centers of the brain while affecting their higher reasoning functions. The Ktarians use this to attempt to get the crew to entice other members of Starfleet to play the game, eventually controlling the entire Federation. **In the two-part \\"Chain of Command\\" episode Captain Picard is captured and a Cardassian agent uses traditional methods of brain-washing (sensory deprivation, sensory bombardment, forced nakedness, stress positions, dehydration, starvation, physical pain, and cultural humiliation). **In the episode \\"Conspiracy\\" alien brain parasites have taken control of key Starfleet officers in an attempt to take over that organization. * * In Star Trek: Voyager the episode \\"Equinox\\", Seven's brain is operated on by the unethical doctor to reveal codes she refuses to give. * * In the 1987 animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles TV series season 3 episode \\"Corporate Raiders from Dimension X\\", Shredder kidnaps businessmen all across New York City and takes them to the Octopus Inc. headquarters, where he brainwashes them by indoctrination to carry out crimes, and kidnap more businessmen. * * In the first season of the Netflix original series Marvel's Jessica Jones, main antagonist Kilgrave‚Äîknown in comics as Purple Man‚Äîhas the ability to compel people to obey his orders. He uses this power to force protagonist Jessica into an abusive relationship. Within the series' context, Kilgrave's mind control is an allegory for manipulative and abusive behavior. Jessica's enhanced strength and her resistance to Kilgrave's abilities, on the other hand, embody free will and women's empowerment. * Several Batman villains have the power of hypnosis; examples include the Mad Hatter, who relies on various technological devices to brainwash individuals, and Poison Ivy, who uses pheromones, plant-based creations, and occasionally supernatural means to take control of others, especially men. * In Little Shop of Horrors, a strange and interesting plant, hypnotizes and controls its caretaker Seymour's mind in order to gain world domination. The Plant Audrey II, does this by manipulating Seymour to feed it blood in order to grow. As the plant matures it begins to talk, but is most likely the hallucination of the psychosis state Seymour or any person who is being controlled by the plant can see or hear. The plant promises future rewards for Seymour to inherit all he desire, without Seymour realizing it would lead him to his own demise. Video games *In the critically acclaimed DC Comics video game Batman: Arkham City, highly trained mercenaries loyal to a rogue private military firm, Tyger Security, have been systematically programmed (through a combination of psychoactive drugs and posthypnotic manipulation) to blindly hate the protagonist and answer only to their employer, the ruthless Hugo Strange. Following Strange's death late in the game's storyline these effects seem to have been broken, as Tyger units promptly cease following current orders and withdraw quietly from the scene. *In BioShock, the player's character, Jack, is revealed to have been subconsciously mind-controlled and must obey any action stated after the command phrase, \\"Would you Kindly?\\". *In Call of Duty: Black Ops, the protagonist, Alex Mason, is brainwashed while imprisoned in the Vorkuta Gulag. *In the MMORPG City of Heroes, players of the Controller class can opt for the primary list of powers dubbed Mind Control, which includes the ability to affect emotions remotely, confuse, inhibit or affect physical actions, and cause psionic damage to opponents. *The character Yuri in Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 is an extremely advanced telepath with the capability of completely controlling the actions of others. There is one flaw, however: a mind-controlled person can be seen to be showing strain against Yuri's power, culminating in sweating, stammering and memory loss. Later, in the game expansion Yuri's Revenge, he leads an entire faction with several mind controlling units included. His \\"psychic dominators\\" also possess the ability to permanently mind control units. *In Crash Bandicoot series, Doctor Neo Cortex, Crash's nemesis, wants to control the mutant minds with the Cortex Vortex to conquer the world. *In the Danganronpa series, the main antagonist, Junko Enoshima, brainwashes multiple people into committing acts of despair, for example brainwashing the 77th Class of Hope's Peak Academy and converting them into Ultimate Despair. *In the series Destroy All Humans!, the main character, Cryptosporidium, can use mind control to force humans to do his bidding. *In Dreamfall: The Longest Journey, the mysterious Project Alchera is revealed to be a form of mind-control, marketed to the masses as a form of entertainment. *In Final Fantasy IV, the playable character Kain is mind controlled by Golbez to act as his lieutenant to seize crystals around the earth.

The control is broken once the slave crown is removed. *In Heroes of the Storm, the playable hero Sylvanas has access to Mind Control, as one of her two heroic abilities. *In Lego Batman, some of the playable villain characters can use a power called mind control, which allows them to take control of an enemy to open doors or reach inaccessible areas. *In the Mass Effect series the primary antagonists, the Reapers, use a form of mind control called \\"indoctrination\\" to manipulate people into becoming willing servants and thralls. *In Metal Gear Solid, Psycho Mantis, a rogue special forces member with powerful telepathic abilities, subtly controls a small army, and on several occasions completely dominates a single person's movements and speech. * In Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy, the player's character, Nick Scryer can perform mind control. *In Resident Evil 4, the enemies are civilians mind-controlled through the use of parasites known as \\"Las Plagas\\"; in Resident Evil 5, the main antagonist, Albert Wesker, uses a special drug to brainwash a recurring protagonist, Jill Valentine. *In Sonic Pinball Party, Doctor Eggman, Sonic's nemesis, turns all the people into robots, kidnaps Sonic's assistant Miles \\"Tails\\" Prower and Sonic's love interest Amy Rose, ties them up to a chair, puts them on a device and brainwashes them. *In the MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic, players that choose a force user class can occasionally force persuade a NPC during conversations, which sometimes allow the player to manipulate the actions and decisions of NPCs. This ability may change the outcome and situation of the dialogue. *The Dark Archon, a unit in the computer game StarCraft, has the ability to psionically mind control other units, indefinitely taking complete control of them. *In Super Mario Odyssey, Mario can throw Cappy on enemies or other objects to temporally control them. *In Super Paper Mario, the character Nastasia has the ability to brainwash people by looking them in the eyes, this is the way she brainwashes Luigi as well as Bowser's Goomba and Koopa army. *In the MMORPG World of Warcraft, players of the priest class gain the ability to mind-control other humanoid characters, gaining full control over their actions for a short period.

Starlight Glimmer, another antagonist, used a combination of a magic staff and more traditional forms of mind control (including solitary confinement, denial of care, and constantly broadcasting messages via loudspeaker) to create a cult of ponies obsessed with the idea of conformity. * In the Monkees episode \\"The Frodis Caper\\", an insane wizard captures a sentient potted plant from outer space and attempts world domination by broadcasting the plant's mind-control eye over television. * In the American soap opera Days of Our Lives, several characters including John Black, Hope Brady, and Steve Johnson, were subjected to brainwashing and mind control by Stefano DiMera and other villains, in order to turn them into assassins and mob \\"soldiers\\". * In the horror/thriller film series Candyman, Daniel Robitaille/Candyman uses mind control on a few of his main victims who denies his existence to carry out his murders supernaturally. In the 1992 film, he uses his ability to hypnotize Helen Lyle and leads her into psychosis by framing her for the gruesome murders he carried out. As with the 1999 film, he also puts his granddaughter Caroline McKeever under a trance and is framed for the crimes. In the 2020 film, He possesses Anthony McCoy as a vessel in his hallucinations to actually commit his murders through mind control. Entertainment Hypnotism has often been used by stage performers to induce volunteers do strange things, such as clucking like a chicken, for the entertainment of audiences. The British psychological illusionist Derren Brown performs more sophisticated mental tricks in his television programmes, Derren Brown: Mind Control. The late Russian psychic, Wolf Messing, was said to be able to hand somebody a blank piece of paper and make them see money or whatever he wanted them to see. Britney Spears' video for Slave 4 u has been shown to include powerful visual and auditory subliminal mind control techniques, capable of implanting long lasting suggestions with a single viewing. While not entirely responsible for the single's popularity they are likely to still influence the devotion of many fans to this day.

Henry Segrave drove the car at 231.45 mph (372.46 km/h) in March 1929 on Daytona Beach, exceeding the previous record by 24 mph (39 km/h). The car Built for ex-Sunbeam racing driver Major Henry Segrave to take the Land Speed Record from Ray Keech, Golden Arrow was one of the first streamlined land speed racers, with a pointed nose and tight cowling. Power was provided by a 23.9 litre (1462 ci) W12 Napier Lion VIIA aeroengine, specially prepared by Napiers, designed for the Supermarine aircraft competing in the Schneider Trophy, producing 925 hp (690 kW) at 3300 rpm. The car was designed by ex-Sunbeam engineer, aero-engine designer and racing manager Captain John Samuel Irving (1880-1953).Captain J. S. Irving. The Times, Tuesday, Mar 31, 1953; pg. 8; Issue 52584. It featured ice chests in the sides through which coolant ran and a telescopic sight on the cowl to help avoid running diagonally. The Rootes brothers, friends of Segrave and Irving, provided the Irving-designed individual aluminium body panels from Thrupp and Maberly. The Golden Arrow in 1929 In March 1929, Segrave went to Daytona, and after a sole practice run, on 11 March, in front of 120,000 spectators, set a new flying mile at 231.45 mph (372.46 km/h), easily beating Keech's old speed of 207.55 mph (334.00 km/h). Two days later, another record attempt by Lee Bible's White Triplex resulted in a crash which killed both Bible and a photographer. Daytona Beach was subsequently closed and Segrave was unable to make further runs to try for even higher speeds. Golden Arrow never ran again and the following year Segrave himself was killed while setting a water speed record.

Motor Sport, page 7 May 1929 Irving had left Sunbeam and his new employers, Humfrey-Sandberg, granted him permission to use part of his time designing and constructing Golden Arrow for ex-Sunbeam driver Henry Segrave. Golden Arrow was, Segrave said, very docile compared with other cars of its kind. After the first trial run when he established no goggles were necessary at Segrave drove the car up some planks to get it off the beach then drove it back along the main street of Daytona to its garage. A Napier Lion II engine cutaway Engine fairings removed The sponsors required a British brand name for the engine and Napier was chosen. Dunlop's tyres were not warranted safe beyond so the planned maximum of was pulled back. To minimise frontal area Irving based the shape of the nose on the racing Supermarine S.5's cowling. Leading fairings in front of the front wheels gave no useful improvement and they were abandoned. An irreducible minimum was arrived at for the size of the cockpit because it had to be large enough for a sixteen-inch steering wheel believed to be needed to give sufficient leverage. In the end a large tail fin was adopted in case of side gusts, it located the centre of gravity an inch in front of the centre of pressure. The whole shell was shaped to exert a downward air pressure to keep the driving wheels on the ground and assist stability but a further of lead ballast was added to the tail. The twin prop-shafts were given strong casings in case they came apart at high speed. The axle was given no differential. At that time the car was notable among land speed record cars for having 4-wheel brakes. Suspension was by half-elliptic leaf springs all round, axle travel was limited to just 1¬º inches in front and 1¬æ at the rear axle. The car was built at KLG Works on Kingston Hill. Segrave found he could not use all the throttle opening until past 2400 rpm, or, in bottom gear, until the car was moving in excess of . The engine ran throughout without a misfire and the extra ice cooling turned out to be unnecessary. Segrave made just the two runs. Including that first test run it is doubtful if the car has travelled as much as in its whole life. Irving was helped by chief draughtsman W U Snell, his brother lent by Alvis to supervise the car's building and his daughter who dealt with all the associated progress-chasing and administrative work. The engine cannot be run again because the cylinder blocks were not properly inhibited and are now too porous. Wakefield / Castrol presented the car to the National Motor Museum at Beaulieu in 1958.

Beam Piper. He was a state trooper of the Pennsylvania State Police, who was accidentally picked up by a cross-time flying saucer (really a Paratime conveyor) and carried to another timeline. Life before Hostigos Calvin Morrison was the son of a Presbyterian minister who had pressured him into studying for the ministry. However, his main academic interest was history, particularly military history. At the outbreak of the Korean War, he left his studies and joined the Army. Sometime after the war, he joined the Pennsylvania State Police, rising to the rank of corporal. On May 19, 1964, Calvin was on a police assignment when he was picked up by a \\"cross-time flying saucer\\" and carried to another timeline. According to First Level designations, Calvin was originally from Fourth Level, Europo-American, Hispano-Columbian sub-sector. Calvin was transported to Fourth Level, Aryan-Transpacific, Styphon's House sub-sector. Arrival in Hostigos Calvin found himself in another world that looked like Pennsylvania. He is also surrounded by old-growth forest, and he knows the area was clear-cut in the past. This initially leads him to believe that he has traveled several centuries forward in time. However, certain features were not the same, such as some nearby mountains not being quarried, a rather permanent alteration of the known landscape. Morrison finds some friendly peasants who speak an unknown language. In the middle of a meal, they are attacked by a large raiding party, which he is instrumental in routing. Reinforcements arrive and, in the confusion, he is shot by the beautiful young woman leading them. Fortunately, the bullet hits his badge, saving his life, though he is still seriously wounded. While recuperating, he learns the new language. Calvin learned that the people called themselves the Zarthani and that he was in the Princedom of Hostigos, which was part of the Great Kingdom of Hos-Harphax. Hostigos is ruled by Prince Ptosphes and it was Ptosphes daughter Rylla who shot Calvin. The Zarthani do not use surnames and pronounce Calvin's name as Kalvan, the name that Calvin is known by after that point. Kalvan learns that Hostigos is being threatened by the Princedom of Nostor and the Princedom of Sask. Hostigos had very little gunpowder (or fireseed as it was called) because the Hostigi had been placed under the Ban of Styphon. Styphon was one of the Zarthani gods, and the priests of Styphon control the production and distribution of fireseed. Kalvan, however, knew the ingredients and the formulation of gunpowder, and created a batch to show the Hostigi, which performs better than the Styphoni variety. Soon the Hostigi were creating fireseed in secret while Kalvan prepared their army. Kalvan introduced the rapier and rifling, and also improved the Hostigi cannons by moving the Princedom away from bombards and into fieldpieces with trunnions, including retrofitting their existing guns with trunnions. Kalvan and the Hostigi army launched a surprise attack on Tarr-Dombra, which was controlled by the Nostori. After the castle (or Tarr as they are known in the language of the Zarthani) was captured, Kalvan sent the Nostori the recipe for making fireseed, since the real enemy of the Hostigi is Styphon's House and not Nostor, which is merely their pawn.

However, since Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen takes place in H.

Created by Gerry Conway and Rafael Kayanan,The Fury of Firestorm #28 (October 1984). DC Comics. the character made his first appearance in The Fury of Firestorm #28 (October 1984). Fictional character biography Slipknot works for a chemical company in the southern United States, where he develops his formula for the durable ropes he would later use as Slipknot. Slipknot's first appearance, when he is hired by the villain Multiplex to attack Lorraine Reilly/Firehawk (The Fury of Firestorm #28, October 1984), ends with Slipknot in police custody. He returned from time to time as an antagonist of Firestorm. Suicide Squad Slipknot comes under the attention of the Suicide Squad. They are a varied team, all serving the government for their own reasons. Many members are criminals, who are promised a reduced sentence if they survive their missions, with Slipknot first joining in The Fury of Firestorm #64, October 1987. Slipknot is taken along when the threat of the Manhunters arises on Earth during the Millennium crisis. A stronghold of Manhunter robots is discovered deep in American swamplands, not far from the Suicide Squad's own base located in the Belle Reve prison. Slipknot and the Squad, including members such as Bronze Tiger, Rick Flag, and Captain Boomerang, are sent in to escort the \\"Baby Huey\\" (a car-bomb laced with an experimental high yield explosive) on a search-and-destroy mission. Slipknot discusses the 'arm band bombs' with Captain Boomerang. These deterrent devices are placed on the less trustworthy members and are set to explode if the person goes too far out of range. Captain Boomerang states that he believes the bombs are fake. This is enough for Slipknot. When he discovers his talent for strangling is useless against robots he makes a run for it into the swamp. The device begins beeping and flashing an alarm, but Slipknot ignores the warning and once he gets out of range, his left arm is blown off. Boomerang, who had not been sure of the bombs' existence himself, thinks to himself, 'better you, than me'. Following the success of the mission, in which the Manhunter base is destroyed and the Squad's medic Karin Grace is sacrificed, Slipknot is found, weakened and bleeding but still alive, by Duchess (Lashina in disguise). 2004 In the 2004 miniseries Identity Crisis, Slipknot is in prison, having taken up the Kobra religion, and the practice of hissing while he talks.Identity Crisis #4 (November 2004).

However, when he is later interrogated, he reveals that he has no knowledge of the crime in question, which is later revealed to have been a hoax by Loring herself. During the 2005 \\"Infinite Crisis\\" storyline, it is revealed that Slipknot was captured by OMACs, who have scheduled him and dozens of other supervillains for execution. He escapes when Robin defeats the OMACs, but is quickly captured again and put into U.S. Army custody. During the \\"One Year Later\\" storyline, Slipknot is featured on the cover of Checkmate v2 #20, but does not appear in the comic's interior. He appears in the 2009 mini-series Final Crisis Aftermath: Ink fighting the new Tattooed Man, Mark Richards, in league with fellow mercenary Cannon. His right arm, missing from his ill-fated mission with the Suicide Squad, was replaced with a bionic appendage, but the replacement limb was badly damaged while fighting the Tattooed Man. In retaliation, Slipknot killed Richards' son.Titans: Villains For Hire Special (May 2010).

History  Founded in 1876, Callahan City was envisioned as a center of commerce and government for the then quite sparsely populated Callahan County. Located along the Western Trail to Dodge City, the community hosted several merchants who served the trail drivers who passed through the area along with more than 100,000 head of cattle through the mid to late 1870s. Though a spot of some local importance, Callahan City's relatively remote location hindered its growth; local merchants often had to wait a month or more for goods to be freighted in from Fort Worth. The community was dealt a severe blow in December 1877 when it lost the county seat to neighboring Belle Plain in a hotly contested election. In 1880, Callahan City was bypassed by the railroad, and the few remaining residents dispersed leaving the town all but abandoned. Today, the former cemetery is all that remains of the community.

It was over long and passed through three tunnels, and was the last commercially operated railway in Australia to use steam locomotives.Richmond Vale RailwayNeath Mount Sugarloaf - Book 2, West Wallsend Public School Centenary Committee, 1988, p.104-107, History The line was privately owned, by the private firm of J & A Brown and its successor companies, J & A Brown and Abermain Seaham Collieries Limited (JABAS) and Coal & Allied Industries Limited. It was constructed in sections, the earliest section being from Hexham to Minmi, built by John Eales in 1856 to service his colliery at Minmi. At Hexham the railway crossed the then Hunter River Railway Company's line to Maitland (the current Main North line) and several coal loading staiths were built on the bank of the on the Hunter River to allow the loading of coal onto ships. Minmi Collieries & Railways In March 1859 J & A Brown purchased the railway & mine from John Eales. By June 1859 they had constructed a connection and exchange siding with the Great Northern Railway at Hexham to allow the coal to be railed to the shipping port at Newcastle. In 1861 J & A Brown extended the railway line at Minmi a further and sunk a new pit named 'C' pit, they also established a workshops at this pit. In 1874 a new tunnel colliery named Duckenfield Colliery was sunk to the North of 'C' pit and a branch railway was laid to this colliery. This was soon followed in 1876 by another new colliery sunk to the East of 'C' pit named Brown's Colliery (also known as Back Creek Colliery), a new branch line was also laid to this mine. The fastest recorded journey on the line was a late passenger train from Minmi to Hexham at .Newcastle Morning Herald 6 July 1946. Richmond Vale Railway & Collieries ROD 2-8-0 locomotive hauling a loaded coal train on the Richmond Vale Railway The New South Wales Legislative Assembly passed the Richmond Vale Coal-mine Railway Act in 1900 which allowed the construction of line from the Minmi line (at a location later known as Minmi Junction) to serve Richmond Vale Colliery. Richmond Vale Coal Mine Railway Act In October 1900 before construction of the line had commenced the Browns had purchased the adjoining Stanford Greta Colliery which was renamed Pelaw Main in April 1901. Until the RVR was completed to Pelaw Main its production was hauled over a connecting railway to the East Greta Coal Mining Company's Stanford Merthyr Colliery and then onwards to East Greta Junction. Construction of the RVR did not commence until early 1904, with construction of the line to Pelaw Main completed June 1905, with the branch line to Richmond Vale Colliery being completed in August 1905. Richmond Vale Colliery although founded in 1890, was not fully developed until 1910 when the colliery was renamed Richmond Main in 1911, however the mine did not reach full production until 1918. In 1909-10 the line across Hexham Swamps was duplicated between the exchange sidings and Richmond Vale Junction (latter renamed Minmi Junction). During 1913-14 with the development of Duckenfield No.2 colliery at Stockrington taking place, the main line was duplicated between Minmi Junction and Stockrington. A cabin to house the electric staff instrument for the section to Six Mile Loop was constructed at Stockrington. In 1942 with the re- arrangement of the main lines at Stockrington to cater for the new Stockrington No.2 Colliery a new staff cabin was built adjacent to the level crossing at Doghole and the staff instruments were relocated to this new cabin. Method of safeworking The original safeworking the line after the opening of the RVR was a \\"Ticket and Telephone System.\\" Tickets were issued to the train driver at the start of the section, and the information was telephoned to the officer in charge at the other end of the section. The section at the time was Pelaw Main to Richmond Vale Junction (later renamed Minmi Junction). Trains were not allowed to travel in opposite directions on the section at the same time, and before a train could enter the section the section had to be cleared by phone communication with the other end of the section. There was a 30-minute delay between trains proceeding in the same direction, and if the preceding train was still in the section \\"Caution\\" was written on the ticket issued. This system worked well until November 1910, when a railmotor carrying the manager of Pelaw Main Colliery collided with the rear of a coal train in No.2 Tunnel, killing him and seriously injuring his passenger. After the coroner's inquest into this accident, electric staff instruments were installed by the New South Wales Government Railways for J & A Brown. As part of the installation of electric staff instruments, the loop at six mile loop was brought into use as a crossing point. Staff instruments were installed at Minmi Junction, Six Mile Loop, Richmond Main Junction (Later renamed Richmond Vale Junction) and Pelaw Main. When Richmond Main Colliery started producing coal instruments were also installed for the Richmond Main - Richmond Vale Junction Section. The Minmi Junction staff instruments were moved to Stockrington in 1914 with the completion of the duplication of the line from Minmi Junction. After the construction of the direct passenger line was constructed between Richmond Main and Pelaw main Collieries in 1922, electric staff instruments were also installed on this line. The double track section of the RVR was worked by \\"Telephone Block\\" controlled by the traffic officers at both Hexham and Stockrington. Stockrington Area Collieries During 1912 development work started for a new mine named Duckenfield No.2 Colliery, which was located at Stockrington (near Minmi) on the RVR, but work ceased on this work in 1914. In 1922 development of Duckenfield No.2 recommenced and by the time this colliery was ready to produce coal in 1935 it had been renamed Stockrington Colliery. Further Collieries were developed in the Stockrington Valley: Duckenfield No.5 Colliery (in 1931), Stockrington No.2 Colliery (in 1940) and Stockrington No.2 Colliery No.3 Tunnel (in 1954). Closure of Minmi Collieries Duckenfield Colliery at Minmi closed in 1916 and Brown's Colliery closed in 1924, both mines were, however, maintained, and the railway line remained open to serve the workshops. Following a need for Borehole seam coal for use in the new water tube boilers at Richmond Main Power Station, both mines were reopened on a smaller scale in 1930. Both collieries remained open until 1932, and in 1934 both mines were sealed, the remaining workshop equipment moved to the workshops at Hexham and the line to Minmi was then closed and used for wagon storage. In late 1948 the line was relaid up to a point near where the Duckenfield Colliery branch left the main line to serve a new open cut mine being developed. This open cut opened in 1949 and mined the borehole seam outcrop around the Minmi area; this open cut removed any remains of both Duckenfield and Brown's Collieries. The open cut remained open until July 1954, the Minmi branch remained until being lifted for scrap in 1974. Passenger Line between Richmond Main and Pelaw Main Collieries In 1922 to increase capacity on the Pelaw Main to Richmond Vale Junction section a 'Direct Passenger Line' was built from the compressor house at Pelaw Main to Richmond Main. This line was used for the miner's passenger trains from Pelaw Main to Richmond Main. After the centralisation of locomotive facilities at Pelaw Main in 1925 this line was also used for the transferring of locos and rolling stock between the two collieries. The miners' trains over this line ceased in April 1959, the line remained open for locomotive movements until the closure of Richmond Main. Changes in company ownership On 5 March 1930, the last major Brown family member John Brown, aged 78, died, and the J & A Brown firm was amalgamated with Abermain Seaham Collieries Limited with the new company being known as J & A Brown & Abermain- Seaham Collieries Limited (commonly abbreviated to JABAS). This merger added the three Abermain Collieries served by their own railway and the SMR and the two Seaham Collieries served by a private line that branched off the main Northern Railway at Cockle Creek, to the collieries controlled by the company. Soon afterwards in April 1931 JABAS purchased the East Greta Coal Mining Company Limited, which was in financial trouble due to the recent miner's lockout. This added Stanford Merthyr No.1 at Stanford Merthyr, Stanford Merthyr No.2 at Paxton, and the recently closed East Greta Nos.1 and 2 Collieries at East Greta, all of which were served by the SMR under the company's control. This also gave JABAS a 50% interest in South Maitland Railways. Soon after this JABAS replaced the Merthyr with Main in the two Stanford Merthyr collieries names so they could market their Greta seam coals under a common \\"Main\\" name. In 1960 JABAS merged with Caledonian Collieries Limited to form Coal & Allied Industries Limited. After this merger JABAS became the subsidiary company that carried out the mining operations of Coal & Allied until being renamed Coal & Allied Operations Pty Ltd in 1980. In April 1967 Coal & Allied purchased Hebburn Limited which added Hebburn No.2 and its associated railway to the company's assets. The purchase of Hebburn Limited also gave Coal & Allied full ownership of South Maitland Railways Pty Ltd. The 'Link Line' and flood workings The Richmond Vale railway had two connections to the nearby privately owned South Maitland Railway lines at Pelaw Main. The first being the original connection to Stanford Merthyr Colliery, which fell out of use after the completion of the RVR in 1905, this connection was rebuilt in 1934 after the 1931 purchase of the East Greta Coal Mining Company by JABAS to allow the haulage of coal from Stanford Main No.1 Colliery over the RVR. The second connection to the South Maitland system dated from 1936 when a \\"Link Line\\" was constructed from Pelaw Main Colliery to the SMR at Weston. This line was used by JABAS for any gas coal from its 3 Abermain collieries and Stanford Main No.2 Colliery at Paxton that was for shipment at the company's coal loader at Hexham, any coal that was to be shipped at the Dyke at Newcastle still had to travel over the SMR to East Greta Junction and the New South Wales Government Railways to Newcastle. With the opening of the coal preparation plant at Hexham the traffic over the line increased as the small coal that was to be washed also travelled over the link line. The line fell out of use after the closure of rail operations at Abermain No.2 Colliery in December 1963 and the connection with the SMR was lifted in August 1964, the line was lifted during 1973. The Richmond Vale railway provided a separate route and connection to the Main North line at Hexham and was used as an alternate route when the South Maitland lines were flooded during the 1949-1952 and 1955 floods. Hexham Coal Preparation Plant To cater for the increased demand for small coal a central coal preparation plant was built by JABAS adjacent to the exchange sidings at Hexham. Construction of this plant and associated sidings began during 1953 and the completed plant came into operation in June 1953. The preparation plant was served by a series of new sidings with connections to the RVR at the Stockrington end entry to the exchange sidings and to the NSW Department of Railways coal roads. The connection to the government mainlines was at the southern end of the plant and these sidings were known as J & A Brown's Coal Plant Sidings, Hexham. The sidings had a dump station for unloading the unwashed coal and a loading point for loading the washed coal into coal wagons. The connection to government main remained in use until 1962, when following the construction of a stacking and reclaim system the plant was then serviced via the exchange sidings and the connection was removed in 1973. Closure of the line beyond Stockrington Richmond Vale Railway's No.10 Richmond Main at Doghole crossing after leaving Stockrington in May 1972 A dramatic slump in the coal industry from the mid-1950s on saw many colliery closures. Following the opening of Stockrington No.2 Colliery No.3 Tunnel in 1954, Duckenfield no.5 Colliery closed in 1955, followed by Stockrington Colliery in 1956 and Stockrington No.2 Colliery in 1957. Stanford Main No.1 Colliery closed in 1957; in February 1961 Pelaw Main Colliery closed, although the railway line to this mine remained open to serve the locomotive sheds at this colliery. On 14 July 1967 Richmond Main Colliery, that had once held the record for the largest daily production in the State, was also closed, except for its power station which lasted until 1976. After the closure of Richmond Main Colliery, J & A Brown, Abermain Seaham Collieries Limited, ceased operations beyond Stockrington No.2 Colliery on the Richmond Vale Railway. All serviceable locomotives were transferred from Pelaw Main to the Hexham Exchange Sidings and others transferred to Pelaw Main sheds. Loading also ceased at the staithes at Hexham with the \\"60-miler\\" collier MV Stephen Brown loading for the last time on 1 November 1967\\\\. The railway line to the staithes remained in use serving the adjacent engineering workshops. Despite Stockrington No.2 Colliery continuing to work at full capacity, following the closure of the line beyond Stockrington the railway began single line working only. Initially the \\"up\\" line was used with the \\"down\\" line being used for the storage of surplus coal hopper wagons. However over the remaining life of the railway both lines saw long periods of single line working. This meant a logjam developed from time to time which necessitated week-end workings on the railway in order to reduce colliery stockpiles.Andrews, Brian R., Stockrington No.2 Colliery Workings in the Australian Railway Historical Society's Bulletin volume XXIII, No.421, November, 1972, p.237-9 The oil crisis of the early 1970s revived Stockrington No.2 Colliery's life and by mid 1973 some six to eight trains each carrying 500 Tons ran between Stockrington and Hexham. In 1973 the all of the rails towards Richmond Main beyond the site of the former Stockrington No.1 Colliery were lifted for use at other Coal & Allied (as J & A Brown etc., had now become) operations. In October 1973 the line serving the engineering workshops at Hexham was closed and the right angled crossing across the Government Railway mainline was removed. The engineering workshops remained open constructing and overhauling equipment for the underground coal mining industry. Unit train loader at Hexham and the end of Non-Air working on the PTC main line J & A Brown 10 ton non air wagon at Hexham 1990 During 1972 the Public Transport Commission advised the users of non-air coal wagons that they planned to ban the operation of these wagons to Port Waratah in the near future. Due to the number of loading points at the various Coal & Allied operations that would have needed converting as they were designed accept non- air type wagons only, the company decided to build a \\"Unit Train Loading System\\" at the Hexham Coal Preparation Plant and load all of the company's export coal through this system. The PTC would still work non-air wagons from East Greta Junction to Hexham, but from Hexham onwards the trains had to consist of air braked wagons. The work consisted of a new set of sidings and dump hoppers between the coal preparation plant and the PTC main line to allow the emptying of non-air wagons of washed coal, these sidings were known as \\"Coal & Allied Siding\\". Unwashed coal ran via the existing exchange sidings. The new loading point was constructed at the Newcastle end of the preparation plant and was served by a balloon loop and a 1200T loading bin. The rails for both balloon loop and Coal & Allied Siding came from the section of the RVR beyond Stockrington. The balloon loop was brought into use in June 1973, Coal & Allied siding was also ready for use in June 1973 but due to industrial problems it was not used until 17 August 1973. The last non-air train from Hexham to Port Waratah ran on 15 August 1973. The non-air wagons continued to be used between East Greta Junction and Hexham, but by 1977 the PTC was planning to change over this traffic to the older BCH type wagons that had been released from the longer distance coal trains with the changeover to occur during Easter 1977. Because of this planned changeover large numbers of non-air wagons were scrapped, however by August 1977 with many non-air wagons scrapped and the promised BCH wagons yet to appear on the East Greta to Hexham trains, it became necessary for the SMR, RVR and coal preparation plant at Hexham to work Saturdays to ensure that sufficient wagons were returned to the collieries to allow loading to take place on the following Monday. By late October sufficient BCH trains had been made available to eliminate the need for Saturday workings. By early 1978 it was planned to end the use on non-airs on the main line and the last train ran on 8 February 1978. From this date onwards the remaining 1,000 wagons were used on the RVR between Stockrington and Hexham only. Final closure and demolition Due to the tight economic conditions facing the NSW coal mining industry at the time and the need to rationalise some of its operations, Coal & Allied decided it was more economical to ship the coal to port by road and on 28 August 1987 announced the planned closure of the Stockrington to Hexham line from 25 September 1987. The railway operated normally until 18 September when following a dispute between a loco crew and management, coal haulage ceased and only empty wagons were to be worked to Hexham for storage. The last coal was dumped at the coal preparation plant on 21 September and on 22 September No.25 cleared the empty wagons from the preparation plant and then made two trips to Stockrington to work the remaining empty wagons to Hexham. However, on 24 September as part of the vigorous protest efforts by the railway employees, No.25 was hijacked and after spending a day at Doghole the loco was moved to Lenaghans Drive road bridge and a protest camp set up. However, due to a lack of support from their fellow unionists at the other Coal & Allied operations the protest ended with no effect on 15 October 1987.\\"Vale Richmond Vale\\" Railway Digest November 1987 page 341 Within weeks after the railways closure the sidings were lifted from Stockrington area leaving only the main line and dead end head shunt intact. The rails were also lifted from the RVR served dump hoppers at the coal preparation plant. In January 1988 scrapping commenced of the many stored coal wagons, this scrapping was completed in August 1988. A selection of 40 wagons was kept for preservation by the RVRM. In May 1988 the coal preparation plant at Hexham was also closed, this was followed by the closure of Stockrington No.2 Colliery in June 1988. Demolition of Stockrington No.2 soon followed and this was completed by December 1988. Dismantling of the coal preparation plant at Hexham started in March 1989 with demolition taking place over the following 18 months. With the downturn in the underground coalmining industry the engineering workshops at Hexham also closed in November 1989, this marked the end of Coal & Allied operations in the lower Hunter Valley. Locomotives=Nos. 1 and 2 The first locomotives, No. 1 and 2, used on the original Minmi to Hexham railway were 0-4-2T side tank locomotives built by R & W Hawthorn of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1856 (builders Nos. 947 and 948). In 1922 they were both rebuilt into saddle tanks. No.1 was scrapped in 1942 and No. 2 was sold to Stewarts and Lloyds in 1941. Nos. 3 and 4 J & A Brown No.4 at Hexham, June 1973 In 1878 No. 3, an 0-6-0T saddle-tank, was purchased by J & A Brown from Kitson and Company in Leeds, England (builders No. 2236), this was similar to an engine no. 20, named \\"The Buck\\" which was also built by Kitsons (builder No. 1620), that Browns wanted to buy from the New South Wales Government Railway. 'The Buck', was built in 1870 and was used to haul coal on the Government Railways from Hexham to Newcastle. No. 20 was finally bought from the Government Railways in 1891 and renumbered No. 4 on Browns' roster. From the early 1920s both locos were being used on shunting the staithes at Hexham. No.3 remained in service until 1966 and No. 4 lasted until November 1967. Both survive, No. 3 at the Dorrigo Steam Railway and Museum and No.4 by the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum and is now on display at the Newcastle Regional Museum at the former GNR Honeysuckle Workshops at Newcastle. Nos. 5‚Äì8 Mersey Tanks J & A Brown No.5 at Hexham, June 1973 With the Richmond Vale Railway nearing completion there was a need for larger locomotives to haul the trains over the line, John Brown purchased four large 0-6-4T side-tanks locos from England. These locos had been built by Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1885‚Äì86 for the Mersey Railway in Liverpool. The first three locos were purchased in 1905, with the fourth loco purchased in 1908. Before these locos were shipped to Australia they had their vacuum operated brakes and condensing apparatus removed, they then had enclosed cabs and steam brakes fitted. Upon arrival in Australia they were given J & A Brown Nos. 5‚Äì8 and were known as the 5 class. No. 5 was originally Mersey Railway No. 1 and was built in 1885 (builder's No. 2601) and was named The Major, No. 6 was Mersey Railway No. 7 and was built in 1886 (builder's No. 2607) and was named Liverpool, No. 7 was Mersey Railway No. 9 and was built in 1886 (builder's No.2782) and was named Connaught, No. 8 was Mersey Railway No. 4 and was built in 1885 (builder's No. 2604) and was named Gladstone. Initially Nos. 5‚Äì7 still carried their Mersey Railway nameplates whilst in J & A Brown ownership, no photographic evidence has been found of No. 8 with its nameplates intact whilst in J & A Brown service. After the introduction of the R.O.D. locos the 5 class locos were set aside when major repairs were required. Nos. 7 and 8 had been withdrawn by 1934 and No. 6 was sold to Cessnock Collieries Limited in 1934 for use at their Kalingo Colliery. In 1936 after a period of storage No. 5 was transferred to the JABAS Abermain Colliery railway system where it remained until 1939 it was then placed in storage. In 1941 after being overhauled it was used on the Hexham to Stockrington trains until suffering boiler defects in July 1942 when it was withdrawn. No. 5 is now preserved at the New South Wales Rail Transport Museum, Thirlmere, New South Wales. The Driving wheelset from No.8 also survives at Richmond Main. No. 9 Pelaw Main, No. 10 Richmond Main & No. 11 Hexham No.10 Richmond Main at Hexham, June 1973In 1908 Kitson and Company of Leeds was asked by J & A Brown to supply a large 2-8-2T side-tank engine. This new loco was designed for Browns and was based on the Great Central Railway class 8A 0-8-0 tender engines dating from 1902 that Kitsons had built for the GCR. This loco was built in 1908 (builder's No. 4567) and was fitted with cast brass nameplates by Kitsons with the name Pelaw Main. Upon arrival this was given the number 9 and with the loco being successful and with Richmond Main Colliery undergoing development that two similar locos were ordered. These two new locos were built in 1911 (builder's Nos. 4798 and 4834) and were numbered 10‚Äì11, these two locos were also fitted with brass nameplates No. 10 carrying the name Richmond Main and No. 11 Hexham. These three locos were the mainstay of traffic on the RVR until the arrival of the ROD locos, when they were relegated to secondary duties. By the 1940s the three locos were being used on the Stockrington to Hexham workings. No.11 was withdrawn in 1949 and was scrapped in 1966. By 1954 Nos. 9 and 10 were standby locos and were only used intermittently. However, from 1969 both locos were used regularly in shunting the sidings at Hexham. In October 1972 both locos returned to main line traffic being regularly used on the Stockrington to Hexham trains. No. 9 worked until November 1980 and No. 10 worked until December 1976 and both are preserved at Richmond Main. Nos. 12‚Äì24 RODs ROD 23 at Hexham in June 1973 These 13 locomotives were part of a class of 521 2-8-0 tender engines that were built by several locomotive builders for the Railway Operating Division (R.O.D.) of the Royal Engineers for use in France during the First World War. These locomotives were based on the pre war Great Central Railway Class 8K 2-8-0 locos design by John G. Robinson After the armistice these locomotives were surplus and J & A Brown bought 13 of these locomotives, these were built by the North British Locomotive Company (9), Kitson and Company (1) and the Great Central Railway's Gorton Works (3). These 13 locos were shipped to Australia over a period from March 1925 to March 1927. The first three locos arrived complete on the ' in February 1926. They were unloaded in Sydney and hauled to Hexham. In late 1927 the rest arrived in crates on Brown's new ship the ' on its maiden voyage to Hexham. The dismantled locos were gradually reassembled with the last locos not being reassembled until 1931. The whole 13 locos were never in service at the one time with the maximum in service at the one time being ten in 1954. The class lasted until 28 June 1973 when the last ROD in service No. 24 was withdrawn. Nos. 20 and 24 are preserved by the Dorrigo Steam Railway and Museum and No. 23 is preserved by the Richmond Vale Railway Museum. No. 26 Purchased second hand from the Sydney & Suburban Blue Metal Company's gravel quarry at Widermere in 1948 to serve the recently opened open cut at Minmi, this loco was former NSWGR 2-6-4T side tank loco 2013 built by Beyer, Peacock and Company, Manchester in 1885 (builder's No. 2567). Due to the condition of the loco it underwent a major overhaul at Hexham Workshops and when this was completed in 1949 it was actually transferred to Abermain instead of its intended use on Minmi Open Cut trains. It was fitted with a replacement second hand boiler obtained from Hebburn Limited in 1954. It remained at Abermain until the closure of the Abermain Collieries railway system in 1963 and was then stored at Hexham. In February 1967 it was transferred to Hebburn to replace that system's failed Robert Stephenson and Hawthorns loco. No. 26 was used intermittently on the Hebburn system until December 1967 when it was put aside, it was cut up in March 1970 at Hebburn No. 1 Colliery. 3013 3013 at Hexham in June 1973 Due to problems experienced with No. 26 whilst at Hebburn that required the hiring of a South Maitland Railways locomotive and since that SMR was short of locos due to the state of their loco fleet at the time, JABAS purchased 4-6-4T 3013 from the New South Wales Department of Railways. This locomotive was built by Beyer, Peacock and Company in 1903 (builder's No. 4456). This loco was delivered to Hebburn Colliery at Weston on 15 May 1967, where it remained until the closure of Hebburn No. 2 Colliery in June 1972 when it was transferred to Hexham on 12 July 1972. It was regularly used on duties at Hexham until the arrival of the second SMR Ten class loco in May 1973, when it was used mainly on standby duties until being stored in 1976. In 1981 the loco was sold to the Lachlan Valley Railway, where it was dismantled for overhaul. In October 2009 the dismantled loco was transferred to the Canberra Railway Museum. Abermain Nos. 1 and 2 These two 0-6-0T saddle tank locos were built by the Avonside Engine Company for the Abermain Coal Company No. 1 in 1911 (builder's No. 1606) and No. 2 in 1922 (builder's No. 1916) for use on the Abermain Collieries rail system between Abermain Nos. 2 and 3 Collieries and the exchange sidings with the SMR at Abermain No. 1 Colliery. Upon the formation of JABAS in 1931 these two locos kept their original road numbers and were known as \\"Abermain No. 1 and 2\\". The 2 locos remained on the Abermain system other than when being transferred to Hexham Workshops for overhaul, and their return to Abermain. In 1955 No. 1 loco was transferred to Hexham mainly for use in servicing the new coal preparation plant. It was withdrawn in 1961 after a suffering a burnt boiler and was scrapped in 1966. No. 2 loco was transferred to Hexham in December 1963 after the closure of the rail line servicing Abermain No. 2 Colliery. At Hexham it was used to service the coal preparation plant and the coal staithes until 1969 when it was withdrawn, in June 1973 it was sold to the Hunter Valley Steam Railway and Museum. South Maitland Railways 10 Class Locos The first of the fourteen locos of this class was supplied to the East Greta Coal Mining Company in 1912 by Beyer, Peacock and Company. In the following years the remaining locos were supplied to both the East Greta Coal Mining Co. and its successor South Maitland Railways Pty Ltd with the last arriving in 1926. These fourteen locos were used on coal haulage over the South Maitland system between the various collieries at Cessnock and the transfer point with the government railways at East Greta Junction at Maitland. In 1973 with the remaining R.O.D. locos at Hexham due for withdrawal from service and with South Maitland Railways being a fully owned subsidiary of Coal & Allied since 1967, two 10 class locos were transferred to Hexham. After the withdrawal of No. 9 Pelaw Main in 1980 a third 10 class was transferred to Hexham. After the replacing of steam on the SMR by SRA diesels in June 1983 a fourth 10 class was allocated to Hexham to work the Richmond Vale Railway. All of the fourteen South Maitland Railways 10 Class worked on the surviving section of the RVR between Hexham and Stockrington at various times. All fourteen locos survive. The line today Of the once extensive system, only the relaid former passenger line (Richmond Main-Pelaw Main) and a short section of the line towards Stockrington (Richmond Main-Leggetts Drive) remains, used for tourist trains by the Richmond Vale Railway Museum. The vast majority of the alignment is in situ, and all three tunnels (in impressive condition) and two bridges (dilapidated) are intact. The alignment has been encroached just opposite Leggetts Drive by a private landing strip, and near No. 2 Tunnel by a mining access road, where the cutting has been filled. Some track is still in place across Hexham Swamp and at the former Stockrington Colliery site, though unusable. There are still some physical remnants along the route, the aforementioned bridges and tunnels being the most recognisable. There are two dilapidated buildings remaining at the Hexham site, though not much else remains there. It has been suggested that one or some non-air wagons are sitting in a dilapidated state in the former Stockrington sidings, though this is yet to be confirmed. The Richmond Vale Railway and Mining Museum currently occupies the former Richmond Main Colliery, and operates trains on the former passenger line from Richmond Main to Pelaw Main. The Museum is custodian of a number of historic locomotives and items of rolling stock. Future proposals There was a proposal for a new freight and coal line to bypass the Newcastle urban area. The line would branch off the Main North railway line at Cockle Creek to join the Richmond Vale line near Seahampton, then use the northern (Stockrington-Minmi Junction- Hexham) part of the old Richmond Vale railway to connect to the main government line at Hexham. The line is now being developed to form the Richmond Vale Rail Trail which will provide over of cycle/pedestrian paths linking Hexham to Kurri Kurri and beyond.https://railtrails.org.au/index.php?option=com_railtrails&view;=trail&id;=227&Itemid;=247 Richmond Vale Preservation Co-operative Society After the closure of Richmond Main Power Station in 1976, Cessnock City Council acquired the abandoned Richmond Main Colliery site. In 1979 the Richmond Vale Preservation Co-operative Society was formed with the aim of preserving the industrial railway heritage of the Hunter Valley. Based at the Richmond Main site they commenced relaying the rails at the colliery along with the former passenger line to Pelaw Main Colliery and trade as the Richmond Vale Railway Museum.

The mite parasitizes a variety of insect hosts and bites humans, causing red, itchy, and painful wheals (welts). The mites are barely visible, measuring about 0.2-0.8 millimeters; their great reproductive potential, small size, and high capacity for dispersal by wind make them difficult to control or avoid. Life cycle Newly emerged and mated females inject a neurotoxin-containing saliva into their hosts, which paralyzes the host and enables the gravid female mites to feed on the host's hemolymph. The posterior portion (opisthosoma) of the female enlarges as its progeny develops inside, and, within a few days, up to 250 adult mites emerge from the gravid female. Bruce and Wrensch (1990) found that progeny of the straw itch mite averaged 254 offspring of which 92% were females. Males emerge before the females, position themselves around the mother's genital opening, and mate with emerging females. Then, mated females disperse to find new hosts. These mites often are dispersed by wind, and when they land on vertebrate hosts, they attempt to feed, resulting in the bites. A life cycle can be completed within seven days, and progeny emergence can be extended to 15 days. The mites' reported hosts have included Anobium punctatum, the pink bollworm, Grapholita molesta, Tineola bisselliella, Apis cerana (Asiatic honey bee), periodic cicadas, and various pests of stored grain, as well as humans and their pets. Their usual hosts in the United States are oak midge larvae. Cooler, more moist conditions favor its population growth. Outbreaks of attacks on humans in the United States have been attributed to fluctuations in the supply of oak midge larvae. Distribution P. herfsi has been recorded in Czechoslovakia, Egypt,USDA. A Bibliography of the Pink Bollworm Australia,Department of Agriculture and Food, Western Australia northern India,Proceedings of the Indian Academy of Sciences and the United States. It is a regulated pest in Germany. Biologische Bundesanstalt f√ºr Land- und Forstwirtschaft Impact on humans Itch mite bites Rashes resulting from the bite of P. herfsi were first documented in Europe in 1936. The first documented outbreak in the US is thought to have occurred in 1994 in Kansas City, Kansas. The closely related straw itch mite (Pyemotes tritici), was initially suspected, but no specimens of this species were found. The reports indicated that the bites occurred on people after being outdoors in or near wooded areas. Based on this information, a search was initiated and resulted in the discovery of Pyemotes herfsi preying on midge larvae in leaf galls on pin oak trees. The United States Centers for Disease Control estimated that during an outbreak in August 2004, 54% of the population of Crawford County, Kansas, or about 19,000 people, suffered from its bites. Other states in the US where humans have been affected during the 2000s are Nebraska, Oklahoma, Missouri, Tennessee Shelby County, Texas,University of Nebraska, May 2, 2005 and Illinois.Chicago Tribune, August 14, 2007 In August 2008 an outbreak was reported in the northern suburbs of Cincinnati, Ohio by the Hamilton County Public Health Department.WLWT TV, Cincinnati, Ohio, August 26, 2008 Humans typically report itching from mite bites within 10 to 16 hours after contact. The victims often do not recall being bitten. The rash that results from the bites is usually described as a red patch with a small blister in the center, most often found on the neck, face, arms, or upper torso. A secondary bacterial infection sometimes arises when the bite is scratched. The suggested treatments include the application of calamine lotion, an antihistamine cream such as diphenhydramine, or a corticosteroid cream; a suggested preventive measure is the application of DEET before outdoor activity.University of Nebraska, 2005 Anecdotal reports from the Kansas outbreak, however, suggest that DEET might not provide complete protection against P. herfsi. The bites are not life-threatening, but a few individuals suffering 100 or more bites have undergone brief hospitalizations.University of Nebraska, July 2005 References *This article utilizes text taken verbatim from Pyemotes herfsi (Acari: Pyemotidae), a Mite New to North America as the Cause of Bite Outbreaks, a public domain publication of the United States Department of Agriculture.

A philanthropist for most of his life, he left Allerton Garden, the Honolulu Academy of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and Robert Allerton Park as legacies for the public to enjoy. Robert Henry Allerton enjoyed traveling to countries around the world. In these countries he would buy statues of all kinds, which were then placed in his estate. Most of the statues are no longer on the estate, now called Robert Henry Allerton Park, but there are still a few left. Early life Robert Henry Allerton was born on March 20, 1873, as the second child and only son to Samuel Waters Allerton (1828‚Äì1914) and Pamilla Thompson Allerton (1840‚Äì1880). Through an entirely paternal line, Robert Henry Allerton was descended from Isaac Allerton, an English Puritan who came to America on the Mayflower in 1620.Robert Allerton: The Private Man & the Public Gifts by Martha Burgin and Maureen Holtz, September 2009. pg. 3 Samuel Allerton was a self-made man who made his millions in land, livestock, banking, and other commercial enterprises. Pamilla Allerton died in 1880, five days before Robert's 7th birthday. Two years later, Samuel Allerton married Agnes Thompson, Pamilla's younger sister. Agnes Thompson Allerton (1858‚Äì1924) became mother, friend, and cultural mentor for her stepson/nephew. She kindled his interests in literature, music, gardening, and above all, visual arts. The Allertons lived on Prairie Avenue in Chicago, which was the most fashionable residential street in that city in the 1800s. The Allertons were neighbors of Marshall Field, the Pullmans, Kimballs, and Armours. Robert attended Allen Academy and Harvard School in Chicago, after which he and friend Frederic Clay Bartlett, were sent east to St. Paul's School, a prestigious college prep school in Concord, New Hampshire. The young Chicagoans decided not to go on to college, but rather to study art in Europe. In 1922 he met John Gregg (1899‚Äì1986), an orphan and aspiring architect, who after the stock market crash of 1929, came to live with Allerton. He was to become his lifelong companion. After a change in Illinois law in 1959, he legally adopted Gregg as his son. After their deaths, Allerton and Gregg's mingled ashes were scattered on Lawai Bay, Kauai, Hawaii. While, if so, they would have been closeted, it is believed that Allerton and Gregg were involved in a homosexual relationship, at a time when American society was not accepting of such relationships. Same-sex adult adoption had been a utilized by couples in the time before the legalization of same-sex marriages and unions. \\"The Farms\\" Allerton's estate began in 1897 when Allerton decided to become a farmer. By 1914 his \\"farm\\" had grown to over 12,000 acres and became known as \\"The Farms\\". Now called Robert Allerton Park, it is owned and operated by the University of Illinois near Monticello, Illinois. The botanical journal Allertonia and the two estate parks are named after Robert Allerton. The main building of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he served as the honorary president and trustee, was renamed the Allerton Building in his honor in 1968. Hawaii The former Hawaiian Royal tropical estate, located on the island of Kauai in Hawaii, is now called the Allerton Garden. After John Gregg Allerton's death it became part of the National Tropical Botanical Garden, with public tours.

He is known for being the son of Nate Saint, a famous missionary pilot, as well as for his own work among indigenous tribes. Early life Steve was born in Quito, Ecuador, at a mission hospital. He was the second of Nate and Marj Saint's three children. He has an older sister, Kathy, and a younger brother, Philip. The family lived in Quito where his father was a missionary pilot with Mission Aviation Fellowship. In 1956, his father and four other missionaries were killed by Waodani Indians during Operation Auca, during an effort to make peaceful contact with them. After the death of Saint's father, the family moved to Quito where Saint attended school. It was during this time that his aunt, Rachel Saint, and Elisabeth Elliot successfully made peaceful contact with the Waodani and were living with them in the jungle. At 10 years of age, Saint first went to live with the Waodani, staying with them during the summers. He learned about living in the jungle, and also developed relationships with many members of the tribe. In June 1965, \\"Babae\\", as he was called by the tribe, was baptized in the Curaray River by Kimo and Dyuwi, two of his father's killers who had since converted to Christianity. Life in the United States After graduating from Alliance Academy in Quito, Steve Saint moved to the United States to attend Wheaton College where in 1973 he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics. Soon after graduation, he returned to Ecuador and worked for a time as a tour guide. It was there that he met and married his wife Virginia Lynn Olson (known as Ginny) who was from Minnesota and visiting Ecuador on a short-term mission team. Shortly after the birth of their first child, the Saints returned to the United States and lived in Minnesota where Saint began a successful career as a businessman. They later moved to Ocala, Florida. Return to Ecuador In 1994, Rachel Saint died in Ecuador after spending 36 years with the Waodani. Saint immediately traveled to Ecuador to bury her. It was then that the Waodani tribe who had known Saint as a child asked him to move his family down to live with them. After talking the decision over with his family, he accepted the tribe's invitation, moving to the jungle in 1995. Saint worked with the Waodani to improve their living conditions by building a community center and develop a desperately needed economy. Later life Saint left Ecuador in 1996, feeling that his continued presence in the tribe would hinder their progression towards self- independence. He has, however, made several subsequent trips, and continued to work with the tribe. On one such trip, he was helping a group of Waodani Indians put together their own airplane in Shell. A group of Quechua Indians approached him and asked why they could not build an airplane for their tribe. Saint replied that they could, and this was when Saint discovered the need for a global effort aimed at teaching practical skills to indigenous people. Shortly later he founded the Indigenous People's Technology and Education Center, Inc. (I-TEC) whose projects include an airworthy flying car, the I-Fly Maverick. Saint was seeking backing for commercial production.. Saint appeared in and narrated the 2004 documentary film Beyond the Gates of Splendor. In 2005 he published his memoirs, a book titled End of the Spear. In 2006 there was a major film adaptation of the book, and Saint was heavily involved in the production process. He was also the stunt pilot who flew the replica of his father's PA-14 in the film. He has also authored other books including Walking His Trail. Saint has been especially close to Mincaye, one of the Waodani tribesmen who killed his father. He and Mincaye have made several appearances together in television interviews and at Christian concerts throughout the world. Steve now often visits churches to talk about his life. June 2012 injury On June 13, 2012, Saint was seriously injured by a falling piece of equipment while testing it. He was partially paralyzed from the neck down and was scheduled for surgery on June 20, 2012 to relieve pressure on his spine.. By September 2012 recovery was well on its way.. A message on his Facebook page states that he was back to work, writing newsletters by May 2013.. Family The Saints have four children ‚Äî Shaun, Jaime, Jesse, and Stephenie. Shaun is a medical doctor, Jaime works for I-TEC and has six daughters, and Jesse owns Saint Aviation and has 10 children. Stephenie briefly attended the University of Florida, but died in the summer of 2000 of a sudden cerebral hemorrhage. Today, Steve and Ginny live in Ocala, Florida, and continue to make regular trips to Ecuador.

She survived three wars and was awarded eight battle stars for World War II service, four battle stars for Korean War service, and eight campaign stars for Vietnam War service. In the mid-1960s Ashtabula became the lead ship of her class, when she and seven other Cimarron-class oilers were lengthened (\\"jumboized\\"). She has been the only U.S. Navy ship to bear the name Ashtabula, after the City of Ashtabula which was named after the Ashtabula River in northeast Ohio.  History = World War II  Ashtabula (AO-51) was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 717) on 1 October 1942 at Sparrows Point, Maryland, by the Bethlehem Steel Co.; launched on 22 May 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Adolph Augustus Berle, Jr., the wife of the Assistant Secretary of State; and acquired by the Navy on 7 August 1943; and commissioned the same day, Comdr. Louis J. Modave in command. Following shakedown in the Chesapeake Bay, the oiler sailed for Aruba on 10 September to take on fuel oil and aviation gasoline and then continued on, via the Panama Canal, to the South Pacific. After arriving at Tutuila, Samoa, on 22 October, she operated as a member of Service Squadron (ServRon) 8 in the South Pacific until 17 November. Ashtabula next sailed for the United States and entered the Long Beach Navy Yard on 1 December for an availability period. The oiler sailed for Pearl Harbor on New Year's Day, 1944, and remained there until 16 January when she sortied with Task Group (TG) 58.1 for operations supporting the occupation of the Marshall Islands. Ashtabula anchored at Majuro lagoon on 4 February and operated from that atoll in support of the fast carrier task forces through mid June. The ship then began participating in the effort to take the Marianas. During the Battle of the Philippine Sea and its aftermath, she fueled ships of Task Force 58 (TF 58) from 20 through 27 June and then retired, via Eniwetok, to the California coast for yard work which began upon her arrival at Terminal Island on 15 July. The oiler got underway again on 28 August and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 4 September. She continued sailing westward and reached Eniwetok on the 17th. After a two-day respite, the vessel headed for the South Pacific and arrived at Purvis Bay on the 24th where she spent the remainder of the month in fueling duties. Ashtabulas next assignment was to support the first American forces to fight for the liberation of the Philippines. She sailed, via Humboldt Bay and Kossol Roads, to Leyte Gulf and began fueling units of TG 77.2 on 23 October. Late the following afternoon, three Japanese torpedo planes attacked the oiler. One of them dropped a torpedo which hit Ashtabulas port side. Although the explosion caused no fires or personnel casualties, Ashtabula soon developed a 16-degree list to port. Skillful counter-flooding righted the ship and allowed her to resume operations. On 27 October, the vessel was detached from Task Unit (TU) 77.7.1 and headed for the west coast of the United States. Following stops at Kossol Roads, Humboldt Bay, and Pearl Harbor, she reached San Pedro, California, on 15 December and was drydocked at Terminal Island for repair of her torpedo damage. The oiler departed the California coast on 28 January 1945, touched at Pearl Harbor on 3 February, and arrived at Eniwetok on 12 February. She reported to ServRon 10 for duty and remained there until 5 March, when the ship sailed for Ulithi. On 10 March, Ashtabula was reassigned to ServRon 6; and, three days later, she got underway for fueling operations at sea for the warships of the Fast Carrier Task Force, TF 58. On 5 April, Ashtabula's bow struck amidships and caused considerable damage to the seaplane tender. Ashtabula returned to Ulithi on 9 April and underwent minor repair work from 10 to 17 April. There, the oiler once again returned to the control of ServRon 10. For the duration of the war, Ashtabula operated in the Ulithi area. In mid-August, Japan capitulated; and, on the last day of the month, the oiler headed for Okinawa, but soon moved on to Jinsen, Korea, where she arrived on 11 September. For the next six months, Ashtabula operated between ports in Korea, Japan, and China while supplying and fueling American warships. In March 1946, the oiler made a cruise, via Singapore and Ceylon, to Bahrain. She returned to Japan in April. In June and July, she again visited a Mideastern port, Ras Tanura, Saudi Arabia, to replenish her oil bunkers. Ashtabula got underway for a voyage back to the United States. After pausing briefly at Pearl Harbor, the ship arrived at San Pedro, California, on 18 December. Ashtabula began 1947 with a cruise to Guam and returned to California on 27 January. For the next two years, she continued operations between the west coast, Hawaii, and the Marshall Islands. This circuit was interrupted by a visit to Ras Tanura and Bahrain in June 1949. The oiler returned to the Orient in October 1948 and once again operated between the west coast and Hawaii from July 1949 until June 1950. During this time, she provided towing services from Pearl Harbor to southern California ports in addition to transporting fuel. On 28 June 1950, Ashtabula headed north from Long Beach, California, bound for Alaska. Upon arriving at Dutch Harbor, the ship fueled two survey vessels operating in the area. After a brief stop in Point Barrow, Alaska, she returned to Long Beach on 19 August.  Korean War operations  The vessel lay at anchor there until 27 September, when she sailed for Pearl Harbor with a load of aviation gasoline and fuel oil. Due to the growing Korean War, Ashtabula was ordered to proceed immediately to Sasebo, Japan. There, she loaded provisions for American troops stationed in Taiwan, and then delivered them to Keelung. Beginning in November, Ashtabula put to sea to supply fuel and provisions to ships of the U.S. 7th Fleet. She continued these activities until August 1951, when she returned to Long Beach. The ship got back in action in the Far East in November, refueling bombardment forces around the 38th parallel and, later, assisted in the evacuation of Hungnam, Korea. In March 1952, she sailed to Long Beach for an overhaul, but was back at Sasebo by early October. On 30 November 1952, while in Sasebo for an availability, Ashtabula was damaged by twin explosions caused by acetylene torches which ignited gasoline fumes in her forward hold ( deck log of 11/30/1952). Three sailors were killed, and the forward well deck was seriously damaged, the weather deck curling back towards the superstructure and the port hull blown open to the sea. After three months of work at Sasebo, the ship sailed to Long Beach for further alterations. In September 1953, she returned to the western Pacific (WestPac) and resumed replenishment duties. For the next 10 years, the oiler continued alternating deployments to WestPac with periods of upkeep, overhaul, and training at her home port, Long Beach. Ports of call in WestPac included Subic Bay and Manila, Philippines; Hong Kong; Sasebo, Kobe, Nagasaki, Yokosuka, and Kagoshima, Japan; Kaohsiung, Taiwan, and Buckner Bay, Okinawa. During the first half of 1964, Ashtabula continued her peacetime routine. On 2 August, she was in the Gulf of Tonkin refueling destroyers and just a few hours after North Vietnamese torpedo boats attacked Maddox. She spent most of August fueling ships of the 7th Fleet in the South China Sea. Upon completing her WestPac cruise, Ashtabula returned to Long Beach.  Vietnam War operations  For the next eight years, the oiler continued to serve in waters surrounding Vietnam during her regular deployments to the Far East. She provided fuel and supplies to units of the 7th Fleet, while operating out of the ports of Subic Bay and Kaohsiung. Between tours in the Orient, she returned to Long Beach for leave and upkeep. USS Asthabula refueling the carrier off Vietnam in 1966. In 1968, Ashtabula underwent a major reconfiguration, or Jumboization at Todd Shipyards, Los Angeles Division, San Pedro, California. A midsection, built entirely new from the keel up, was inserted and welded between her original bow and stern. This replaced the old midsection and increased the vessel's liquid cargo capacity by over one-third. Her new configuration closely resembled that of a more modern type of ship, the replenishment oiler. She continued her Vietnam service through August 1972, when she made her last line swing off Vietnam. The ship returned to Long Beach on 9 December. Following an availability period at Long Beach and training exercises off the southern California coast, Ashtabula once again sailed west on 4 October 1973. While at Subic Bay, she received orders to proceed to the Indian Ocean operating area. In early December, Ashtabula provided services to aircraft carriers and as well as other members of their task groups. After 51 continuous days at sea, Ashtabula arrived at Subic Bay on 5 January 1974. Following a brief availability there, the oiler got underway to replenish a group of amphibious ships in the Gulf of Siam. On 7 March, she began a three-week voyage to her home port. She spent one month in upkeep, then sailed to her new home port, Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and spent the rest of the year in overhaul and refresher training. Ashtabula began another WestPac deployment on 8 February 1975. She took part in Operation Seafox, a joint SEATO exercise with six other nations. Her next assignments were Operation Eagle Pull and Operation Frequent Wind, held off the coast of Vietnam. On 11 May, she was ordered to Cambodia to support the rescue of , an American merchant ship that had been captured by communist forces. In late July, the oiler returned to her home port, where she spent the next 10 months in upkeep and local operations. Ashtabula sailed for WestPac on 21 June 1976. Ports visited included Subic Bay; Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan; Hong Kong; and Keelung, Taiwan. The cruise was highlighted by a joint training exercise with ships of the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. The oiler arrived at Pearl Harbor on 15 December and spent the first two months of 1977 providing services to ships in the Pearl Harbor area. In March, she headed west to rendezvous with and refuel a task group built around the aircraft carrier . On 2 April, the ship returned to Pearl Harbor and commenced an overhaul period which was completed on 28 February 1978. Ashtabula sailed to Alameda, California, on 10 March to hold a series of qualification trials, returned to Pearl Harbor on 14 April, and began refresher training. She got underway on 30 June for the Far East and called at Song Kla and Pattaya, Thailand; Subic Bay; Sasebo; and Fremantle, Australia. While in Australia, Ashtabula participated in Exercise \\"Sandgroper,\\" which was held in conjunction with the Australian and New Zealand navies. The oiler then proceeded to Singapore and Hong Kong for liberty calls and closed the year in upkeep at Guam. Back at Pearl Harbor on 18 January 1979, Ashtabula began eight months of underway training, local operations, and inspections. At the end of August, she embarked upon a six-week cruise to the west coast to conduct underway replenishment qualification trials and then participate in Exercise \\"Kernel Potlatch II,\\" a joint United States-Canadian operation to test and evaluate plans for the common defense of North America. At the conclusion of the exercise, the oiler called at Esquimalt, British Columbia,on 6 October. After a three-day visit, she headed back to Hawaii on the 9th and arrived in Pearl Harbor on the 16th. Local operations in the Hawaiian Islands occupied Ashtabula's time for nearly the entire first nine months of 1980. On 28 September, the oiler embarked upon another tour of duty in the western Pacific. Steaming by way of Guam in the Mariana Islands, she entered Subic Bay in the Philippines on 15 October. Her deployment was marred at its outset by engineering casualties that required a two-month repair period at Subic Bay. On 12 December, she completed repairs and, the following day, put to sea to begin underway refueling service to the ships of the 7th Fleet. For the next four months, Ashtabula operated in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, and the Sea of Japan, refueling American warships assigned to the Far East. The oiler made visits to several Japanese ports‚ÄîSasebo, Yokosuka, and Iwakuni‚Äîas well as to Okinawa in the Ryukyu Islands and Chinhae in Korea. She also returned periodically to the base at Subic Bay. On 15 April 1981, Ashtabula departed the Philippines to return to Hawaii. She arrived in Pearl Harbor on the 30th.  Final operations  Following a two-month, post- deployment standdown, the ship resumed local operations in the Hawaiian Islands at the end of June. She remained so employed until the end of October when she stood into Pearl Harbor to conclude her last underway period for 1981. The oiler spent the first four months of 1982 carrying out missions in the Hawaiian operating area. On 30 April 1982, she embarked upon her final deployment to the Far East. That tour of duty lasted a little more than three months; she returned to Pearl Harbor on 5 August. Soon thereafter, Ashtabula began preparations for inactivation.  Decommissioning and Disposal  Ashtabula decommissioned at Pearl Harbor on 30 September 1982. She was subsequently towed to Suisun Bay, California, where she joined the Maritime Administration's National Defense Reserve Fleet. Ashtabula was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 6 September 1991 and sold for scrapping in 1995. The shipbreaker, however, entered into default and Ashtabula, approximately 20% scrapped and missing her forward bow, part of the main deck forward, most of her forward superstructure and all masts and kingposts, was returned to the Navy on 27 September 1999. Ashtabula remained berthed at Mare Island Naval Shipyard until she was selected as a target ship in a SINKEX exercise on 14 October 2000. Ashtabula was subjected to eight RGM-84 Harpoon missiles, two RIM-66 Standard SAMs fired in the surface-to-surface mode, three helicopter- launched Sea Skua missiles, four Mk82 500 pound bombs, and nearly one hundred rounds of 3\\", 100 mm, and 5\\" gunfire from an armada consisting of one French, three British and three United States warships.. hazegray.org. Retrieved on 2012-08-05. Ex-USS Asthabula as target ship, 14 October 2000. Two Harpoon missiles and one Sea Skua missile found their marks, but Ashtabula remained afloat the next day.

Consequently, it is a stone frigate, and has existed at several different locations since the Second World War. The first mention of the ship is at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, as a Royal Naval Air Station. Before the war, it was a Royal Canadian Air Force station known as . It was commissioned under the name Saker (or possibly Saker II) on 1 October 1941, and paid off on 1 August 1942, being relieved by HMS Canada once more. Saker II was commissioned as an accounting base at Connecticut Avenue, Washington D.C., on 1 December 1941, and became Saker on 1 November 1942. It had a satellite unit - known originally as - which acted as shore based transit accommodation of the Royal Navy located just outside New York City. It was used by crews picking up ships allocated to the Royal Navy under the provisions of Lend-Lease and by crews sent to collect ships that had been undergoing long term repair, refitting or construction at United States dockyards, and was also used as a base for 'unattached' personnel. In 1943 it was recorded at Lewiston, Maine, where until 1945 it used the facilities at Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Lewiston for operations. From September 1943 through to July 1944, Saker was also used as the name for British personnel at NAS Squantum, and as the name for personnel at NAS Brunswick from August 1943 to August 1945. The Chaplain of Saker in 1945 was K. Boulton Jones, who performed an all-British memorial ceremony for President Roosevelt at St Mark's Church, Adelaide, Brooklyn, on 15 April of that year. From October 1945, it was based in New York City - and in March 1946 moved to 37 Wall Street. In December 1946, it was combined with the British Admiralty Delegation to the US, and was moved to Washington, D.C., then Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia. The last building known as Saker closed in 1976, and all the personnel moved back to Washington. HMS Saker went on to become the collective title for Royal Navy personnel serving in the United States of America, the current commander of HMS Saker - technically Saker III is the Assistant Naval Attach√© of the British Defence Staff ‚Äì US at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C.

The development of HHCode can be traced to efforts by scientists working for the Canadian Hydrographic Service's Atlantic regional offices at the Bedford Institute of Oceanography in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. CHS was facing a problem with storing very large spatial datasets acquired during hydrographic surveys (thus having a temporal element) and was seeking a method to store the datasets in a relational database structure. CHS scientists reportedly conceptualized a spatio-temporal indexing system during a hydrographic survey onboard CCGS Hudson on Georges Bank during the summer of 1989. The indexing system involved an adaptation of a Riemannian hypercube data structure, invoking a helical spiral through 3-dimensional space, which allowed for n-size of features. The actual implementation of the proposed indexing system was termed a helical hyperspatial code and it was first used by modifying an installation of the Oracle database version 4. The HHCode indexing system permitted a highly efficient compression of not only spatial data but other data types as well, while improving search and retrieval times. The HHCode comprises a form of space filling curve and the concept was published by the CHS scientists in the International Hydrographic Review. Oracle Corporation subsequently learned of the innovation which led to an agreement with the Government of Canada which saw the CHS scientists working with a team of Oracle programmers at an office in Hull, Quebec during the early 1990s to redevelop the Oracle database kernel. The resulting software was the Oracle database version 7, with the Spatial Data Option (SDO). Subsequent development of the SDO has resulted in the Oracle Spatial extension to current Oracle databases. With the HHCode being an open-source data format, several spatial data and software companies have adopted it in various products targeted at very large corporate data users, namely Helical Systems Inc. and CubeWerx.

There are two known subspecies, S.t. tyrannus, which is found in Southeastern Brazil and Northeastern Argentina, and the slightly smaller S. t. serus, which can be found elsewhere throughout the species' range. Its preferred habitats include humid and moist forests close to rivers, and several types of woodland. It is uncommon to fairly common throughout most of its range. Its closest relative is the ornate hawk-eagle, which is similar in size, appearance and behavior but lives at lower elevations. Description Ailigand√≠ area, Panama A captive adult black hawk-eagle. The black hawk-eagle is 58‚Äì70 cm (23‚Äì28 in) long and weighs about 900‚Äì1,300 grams (2-2.9 lbs). It has black plumage with varying patterns on its wings and body, and white speckling in places. It has barred wings, slightly elliptical in shape, and a long, narrow tail which is rarely fanned. The four grey bars on the tail are distinctive to the black hawk-eagle, as is the white line seen slightly above the bird's eye. While flying, the broadness and shortness of the wings become apparent.Birds of Venezuela by Steve Hilty. Princeton University Press, 2003 While in flight, the bird's tail is typically kept closed. Diet Though light and small compared to other eagles, this bird is a powerful predator that frequently hunts relatively large prey. It mainly eats large rodents, opossums and monkeys, as well as, occasionally, bats, birds and some reptiles. Its popular name in Brazil is \\"Gavi√£o-pega-macaco\\", which means \\"monkey-catching hawk\\". The birds it takes can be quite large, such as toucans, and chachalacas. Breeding Wild juvenile black hawk-eagle. The black hawk-eagle's breeding behaviour is little known. In a study carried out in Guatemala by The Peregrine Fund, four nests were documented. The average nest height was 25.5m and the nests were all built in lateral limbs away from the center of the tree. All known breeding pairs, both in the wild and in captivity, have laid single egg clutches and the estimating incubation period is 44 days.

From August 1944, Bennemann led JG 53 on Reichsverteidigung missions, initially from bases in France, then from bases in Germany. He claimed his last three victories in October 1944 to bring his final score to 93. Among his 93 victories are at least 10 Il-2 Sturmoviks claimed over the Eastern Front. In early 1945 he participated in the \\"Fighter Pilots Revolt\\", a minor insurrection among the high-ranking Luftwaffe pilots, whereas they confronted the Reich Marshal and chief of the Luftwaffe Hermann G√∂ring with their demands on the conduct of the air war.

The Russian route M8, also known as the Kholmogory Highway or Yaroslavl highway, is a major trunk road that links Moscow to the Russian North in general and the sea harbour of Arkhangelsk in particular. The road runs north of Moscow across a distance of 1271 kilometres through Mytishchi, Pushkino, Sergiyev Posad, Pereslavl- Zalessky, Rostov the Great, Yaroslavl, Danilov, Gryazovets, Vologda, Kadnikov, Velsk, Kholmogory, and Arkhangelsk, ending up in the city of Severodvinsk. It passes Moscow, Vladimir, Yaroslavl, Vologda, and Arkhangelsk Oblasts. In Moscow, the highway is known as Yaroslavskoe Shosse. The stretch of the highway between Moscow and Yaroslavl is part of the Golden Ring of Russia. The highway is part of European route E115. History The predecessor of the highway was the Yam service state road which was established in the end of 14th century and connected Moscow to Kholmogory. Arkhangelsk was founded in 1548 and until early the 18th century served as the main gateway for foreign trade in Russia. In 1703, Saint Petersburg was founded, but the postal service still proceeded via Arkhangelsk, since the Saint Petersburg route was uncertain doe to the war between Russia and Sweden. In 1693, the regular state postal service along the route was established by Peter the Great. In the 18th century, Arkhangelsk lost its significance, and the road was badly maintained. Since 1834, when the postal service in Arkhangelsk Governorate was created, the road maintenance had to be funded from local sources. The road was split into sections funded locally. By the middle of the 19th century, the road comprised 143 bridges and four river crossings. Fourteen postal stations operated with 140 horses. After the October Revolution of 1917 the road was subordinated to the Department of Northern Okrug of Local Transportation and pretty much neglected due to the lack of expertise. The construction of the modern paved highway connecting Moscow and Arkhangelsk was planned in the 1950s and actually started in 1961. In 1967, the paved road between Kholmogory and Arkhangelsk was opened. Much of the construction work was completed by the end of the 1970s, however, most of the road (all stretches north of Yaroslavl) still only supports two- or three-lane traffic. Route M8 close to Rostov, Yaroslavl Oblast. The highway starts in Moscow as Bolshaya Lubyanka Street, Sretenka Street, Mira Avenue, and Yaroslavsky Highway. It crosses the Moscow Ring Road and proceeds to the Moscow Region as a dual carriageway. It runs through the urban area of Mytishchi, bypasses the center of Pushkino and bypasses Sergiyev Posad. As of 2011, the dual carriageway ends at the border of Moscow Oblast, northeast of the city of Sergiyev Posad. The highway crosses a short stretch of Vladimir Oblast and enters Yaroslavl Oblast. It further runs through the center of Pereslavl-Zalessky (there is a ring road) and through the centers of Rostov and Yaroslavl. As of 2011, a stretch which starts north of Rostov and ends south of Yaroslavl was built as a dual carriageway. In Yaroslavl, the highway crosses the Volga River over a bridge. It further bypasses the center of Danilov and enters Vologda Oblast. The highway bypasses the center of Gryazovets and runs into the center of Vologda. The ring road was built in the 2000s which bypasses the center of Vologda from the north, crossing the Vologda River. M8 runs further in the northern direction, bypassing the center of Sokol (it crosses the Sukhona River in the village of Vasyutino southwest of Sokol) and running through the center of Kadnikov. It further passes through the selo and the district center of Syamzha and bypasses Verkhovazhye before entering Arkhangelsk Oblast. M8 runs through the center of Velsk and further north along the left bank of the Vaga River, bypassing the town of Shenkursk (located on the right bank of the Vaga), and north of Bereznik - along the left bank of the Northern Dvina River. It further bypasses the town of Novodvinsk and connects to Arkhangelsk, located on the right bank of the Northern Dvina, by a bridge. The highway route continues further along the left bank of the Northern Dvina to Severodvinsk where it terminates. Junctions In Moscow and Moscow Oblast, where the highway is built as a dual carriageway, it has a limited number of two-level intersections. These intersections are not numbered in Russia. In Moscow, the two-level intersections are * Rizhskaya Interchange, where Mira Avenue crosses the Third Ring Road; * The interchange close to All-Russia Exhibition Centre, connecting Mira Avenue with a number of streets including Zvyozdny Boulevard and Borisa Galushkina Street; * The interchange with Dokukina Street and Rostokinskaya Street; * Severyaninsky Interchange, which joins Mira Avenue and Yaroslavskoye Highway and connects them with Yeniseyskaya Street and a number of other streets; * The interchange with Roterta Street and Kholmogorskaya Street; * The interchange with the Moscow Ring Road (94 kilometer mark of the Ring Road).

Early life and career Bramston, eldest son of Roger Bramston by Priscilla, daughter of Francis Clovile of West Hanningfield Hall, Essex, was born at Maldon, in the same county, 18 May 1577, and educated at the free school at Maldon and Jesus College, Cambridge. On leaving the university he went into residence at the Middle Temple, and applied himself diligently to the study of the law. His ability was recognised early by his university, which made him one of its counsel in 1607, with an annual fee of forty shillings. In Lent 1623 he was appointed reader at his inn, the subject of his lecture being the statute 32 Henry VIII (on limitations), and he was reappointed in the autumn of the same year, this time discoursing on the statute of Elizabeth relating to fraudulent conveyances (13 Eliz. c. 5). Shortly after his reading was concluded he was called to the degree of serjeant-at-law (22 September 1623). His son (Sir John Bramston, the younger) remarks that this was an expensive year for him, the costs entailed by the office of reader being considerable, besides the fee of ¬£500 to the exchequer payable on admittance to the order of Serjeants. His practice now became extensive, and during the next few years he was engaged in many cases of the highest importance, not only in the courts of common law, but in chancery and in the courts of Wards and Star Chamber. In 1626 he defended the Earl of Bristol on his impeachment. A dissolution of parliament, however, soon relieved Bramston from this duty, by putting an end to the proceedings. Next year he represented Sir Thomas Darnel and Sir John Heveningham, who had been committed to the Fleet for refusing to contribute to a loan then being raised by the king without the consent of parliament, applying unsuccessfully for a Habeas corpus on behalf of the one, and bail on behalf of the other. In the following year he was chosen one of the counsel for the city of London on the motion of Sir Heneage Finch, then recorder, who was a close friend and connection by marriage. In 1629 he was one of the counsel for seven of the nine members of the House of Commons (including Sir John Eliot and Denzil Holles) who were then indicted for making seditious speeches in parliament. Next year the Bishop of Ely (John Buckeridge) appointed him chief justice of his diocese, a position he held until his elevation to the king's bench. In 1632 (26 March) he was made queen's Serjeant, and two years later (8 July 1634) King's Serjeant, being knighted 24 November in the same year.Rigg, Volume IV p. 208 Lord Chief Justice In 1635 (14 April) he was created Chief Justice of the King's Bench. In this position his first official act of historical importance was, in concert with the rest of the bench, to advise the king (13 February 1636-7) that he might lawfully levy Ship money, and that it belonged to the crown to decide when such levy ought to be made. Sir John's son informs us that his father was in favour of modifying this opinion in at least one essential particular: that he would have allowed the levy \\"during necessity only\\", and that he was only induced to subscribe the opinion as it stood by the representation made \\"by the ancient judges that it was ever the use for all to subscribe to what was agreed by the majority\\". In July of the same year Bramston was a member of the Star Chamber tribunal which tried the Bishop of Lincoln on the charge of tampering with witnesses, and committing other misdemeanors. The bishop was found guilty by a unanimous verdict, and sentenced to be deprived of his office, to pay a fine of ¬£10,000, and to be imprisoned during the king's pleasure. A similar sentence was passed on him at a later date, Bramston being again a member of the court, on a charge of libelling the Archbishop of Canterbury and the late lord treasurer Weston. In the celebrated Ship money case (Rex v. Hampden), decided in the following year (12 June), Bramston gave his judgment against the king, though on a purely technical ground, viz. that by the record it did not appear to whom the money assessed was due, in that respect agreeing with the lord chief baron, Sir Humphry Davenport, who, with Brooke, Hutton, and Denham, also gave judgment in Hampden's favour ; but taking care at the same time to signify his concurrence with the majority of the court upon the main question. On 16 April 1640, during the indisposition of the lord keeper Finch, Bramston presided in the House of Lords. On 21 December of the same year proceedings were commenced in the House of Commons to impeach the lord keeper Finch, Bramston, and five other of the judges who had subscribed the opinion on Ship money. Next day it was resolved that the message usual in such cases should be sent to the House of Lords. The message was communicated to the peers the same day, and the judges being present (except the lord keeper) were forthwith severally bound in recognisances of ¬£10,000 to attend parliament from day to day until such time as trial might be had. The lord keeper was bound to the same effect the following day. Bramston was thus unable to attend the king when required without rendering himself liable to immediate committal, and as no progress was made towards his trial, the king terminated so anomalous a condition of affairs by revoking his patent (10 October 1642), sending him shortly afterwards (10 February 1642-3) a patent constituting him serjeant-at-law by way of assurance of his unbroken regard. Meanwhile, so far was the parliament from desiring to proceed to extremities with Bramston that in the terms of peace offered the king at Oxford (1 Feb 1642-3) his reappointment as lord chief justice of the king's bench, not as formerly during the king's pleasure, but during good behaviour (quamdiu se bene gesserit), was included. Subsequent career From this time forward until Bramston's death persistent attempts were made to induce him to declare definitely in favour of the parliament, but without success. In 1644 he was consulted by the leaders of the party as to the evidence necessary for the prosecution of Connor Maguire and Hugh Og MacMahon, two prisoners who had made their escape from the Tower of London and been retaken. In 1647 it was proposed to make him one of the commissioners of the great seal, and it was voted that he should sit as an assistant in the House of Lords, \\"which\\", says his son, \\"he did not absolutely deny, but avoided attending by the help of friends\\". In the same year a resolution was come to that he should be appointed one of the judges of the Common Pleas. Even in the last year of his life Cromwell, then protector, sent for him privately, and was very urgent that he should again accept office as chief justice. Bramston, however, excused himself on the ground of his advanced age. He died, after a short illness, in the seventy-eighth year of his age, 22 September 1654, at his manor of Skreens, in the parish of Roxwell, Essex, which he had bought in 1635 from Thomas Weston, the second son of Weston the lord treasurer. He was buried in Roxwell church. In person he is described as of middle height, in youth slight and active, in later years stout without being corpulent. Fuller characterises him as \\"one of deep learning, solid judgment, integrity of life, and gravity of behaviour; in a word, accomplished with all the qualities requisite for a person of his place and profession\\". His son adds that he was \\"a very patient hearer of cases, free from passion and partiality, very modest in giving his opinion and judgment\\" (he seems to have shown a little too much of this quality on the occasion of the opinion on Ship money), \\"which he usually did with such reasons as often convinced those that differed from him and the auditory. Even the learned lawyers learned of him, as I have heard Twisden, Wild, Windham, and the admired Hales, and others acknowledge often\\". Private life Bramston married in 1606 Bridget, daughter of Thomas Moundeford, M.D., son of Sir Edward Moundeford, knight, of Feltwell, Norfolk and his wife Mary Hill, by whom he had a large family, of whom six survived him, viz. three daughters, Dorothy, Mary, and Catherine, and as many sons: John; Moundeford, who was created a master in chancery at the Restoration; and Francis. Sir John, the son, describes his mother as \\"a beautiful, comely person of middle stature, virtuous and pious, a very observant wife, a careful, tender mother\\", \\"very charitable to the poor, kind to her neighbours, and beloved by them\\", and \\"much lamented by all that knew her\\". She died in the thirty-sixth year of her age (whilst John was still at school at Blackmore, Essex) in Phillip Lane, Aldermanbury, and was buried in a vault in St. Mary Magdalen, Milk Street. Sir John continued a widower for some years, his wife's mother, Mary Moundeford, taking charge of his house. In 1631 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Brabazon, 1st Baron Ardee and Mary Smythe, sister of William Brabazon, 1st Earl of Meath, and relict of Sir John Brereton, King's Serjeant-at-law (Ireland). Brereton was her second husband, her first having been George Montgomery, Bishop of Clogher. Bramston's marriage with her was the revival of an old attachment which he had formed as a very young man, but which Lord Ardee had refused to countenance. The ceremony was performed at the seat of the Earl of Meath at Kilruddery House, near Dublin (Kilruddery is still the Brabazon family home). His son John, who accompanied Bramston to Ireland on this occasion, was by no means prepossessed by the appearance of his stepmother. \\"When I first saw her\\", he says, \\"I confess I wondered at my father's love. She was low, fat, red-faced; her dress, too, was a hat and ruff, which though she never changed to her death. But my father, I believe, seeing me change countenance, told me it was not beauty but virtue he courted. I believe she had been handsome in her youth; she had a delicate fine hand, white and plump, and indeed proved a good wife and mother-in-law too.\\" She died in 1647, and was buried in Roxwell Church.

Ukrainization heralded an unprecedented national renaissance in the 1920s. The Ukrainian communists, including prominent ex- Borotbisty, carried forward Ukrainization, a ‚Äúweapon of cultural revolution in Ukraine‚Äù. Ukrainization meant efforts to assert autonomy and counter ascendant Stalinism. Stalinist centralism and its partner Russian nationalism destroyed senses of equality between the republics. The Ukrainian communists and intelligentsia were annihilated. The Borotbist ‚Äúco-founders of the Ukrainian SSR‚Äù were amongst the last remnants of opposition purged under the guise of the destruction of the fake ‚ÄúBorotbist Center‚Äù in 1936.

Pickenoy was possibly a pupil of Cornelis van der Voort and presumably Bartholomeus van der Helst was his own pupil. Life He was the son of the Antwerp monumental mason Elias Claeszoon Pickenoy (1565‚Äì1640) and Heijltje Laurens s'Jonge (1562‚Äì1638), who emigrated to Amsterdam before Nicolaes Pickenoy was born. In 1621, living near the Oude Kerk, he married Levijntje Bouwens (1599-na 1656), an orphan of 21 years. They had ten children: Sara and Elias died young. Pickenoy painted large Schuttersstukken, group portraits of the regents of the orphanage, and individual portraits of local or national celebrities like Nicolaes Tulp, Cornelis de Graeff, Maarten Tromp and Jochem Swartenhont, Elisabeth Bas's husband. The earliest picture ascribed to the artist is \\"Dr. Sebastiaen Egbertz de Vrij's Osteological Presentation\\" of 1619, now in Amsterdam Historisch Museum. His heyday was ca. 1630-1637, a period marked by a high artistic level and numerous commissions from prominent patrons. After 1637 he painted little, save for a number of prestigious‚Äîand lucrative‚Äîgroup portraits. Besides portraits, he also painted a small number of biblical subjects, one of which can be seen in the Museum Catharijneconvent. The Rijksmuseum Amsterdam and Amsterdams Historisch Museum hold many of his best works, not least the Schutterstukken or militia paintings. In 1637 he bought from Adriaen Pauw the house on the corner of Sint Anthoniessluis and Jodenbreestraat, a fashionable area with many painters, art dealers, jewellers and so on. The house had previously been owned by his supposed master, Cornelis van der Voort, and later by Hendrick van Uylenburgh. During the years 1631‚Äì1634 the latter was collaborating with Rembrandt van Rijn, who painted numerous portraits for Van Uylenburgh's art business. Thus the house Pickenoy purchased had been a centre of Amsterdam portraiture for decades. In 1639 Rembrandt returned to the neighbourhood as he bought the house next to Pickenoys, the present day Rembrandthuis. Rembrandt could leave his house via an exit onto the Zwanenburgwal under the house of his neighbor Pickenoy. He brought out Night Watch‚Äîpainted in his courtyard‚Äîrolled up through the tunnel. Like Rembrandt, Pickenoy was not able to bring up the loan and so after eight years he sold the house. The work of Pickenoy is difficult to distinguish from that of some of his contemporaries. Typical of Pickenoy are the fiercely invading light that makes the heads stand out sharply, the somewhat exaggerated gestures, the large greenish brown shadows and the odd-shaped eyes.

Krasnow's early career included working as a promotions man for James Brown and sales representative for Decca Records. In the early 1960s, Krasnow founded MK Records, which released the novelty record \\"Report To The Nation,\\" a parody of the 1960 presidential campaign between John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. He ran the King Records branch office in San Francisco from 1958 to 1964 before moving to Warner Bros Records' R&B; label Loma Records, which he headed from 1964 to 1966. He became vice president of Kama Sutra Records in Los Angeles in 1966, where he founded the Buddah Records subsidiary label. He discovered, signed and then produced the debut album Safe As Milk by Captain Beefheart. In 1968 Krasnow left the Kama Sutra/Buddah labels and founded Blue Thumb Records in Beverly Hills, California with producers Don Graham and Tommy LiPuma. The first release on this label was the second Captain Beefheart album Strictly Personal. Krasnow's use of phasing effects on this album is controversial. Beefheart subsequently condemned the production, which he said was done without his knowledge or approval, though it is claimed by other band members that he initially agreed to it. Among the other acts Krasnow brought to Blue Thumb were Phil Upchurch, Ben Sidran, Gerry Rafferty, Last Poets,http://hitsdailydouble.com/news&id;=304219 The Credibility Gap, The Crusaders, Hugh Masekela,http://www.discogs.com/ja/label/6433-Blue-Thumb- Records Southwind, Ike & Tina Turner, the Pointer Sisters, Dave Mason, Dan Hicks and His Hot Licks, Marc Bolan & T.Rex, Arthur Lee, Clifton Chenier, Love, G√°bor Szab√≥, Mark-Almond, and John Mayall. Krasnow served as president of Blue Thumb until 1974, when he became vice president/talent acquisition for Warner Bros. Records, a role he held until 1983 when he was elevated to chairman and CEO of Elektra/Asylum/Nonesuch Records (later known as Elektra Entertainment). While with Warner and Elektra, he signed Chaka Khan, George Benson, George Clinton, Kraftwerk, Anita Baker, Teddy Pendergrass, Womack & Womack, Public Image Ltd and The Cure to those labels. Krasnow also became known for shelving projects such as Dee Snider's post-Twisted Sister outfit, Desperado, as detailed in Snider's 2012 autobiography, Shut Up and Give Me the Mic. Krasnow abruptly resigned from his position at Elektra in July 1994, the result of a bitter internal struggle within the Warner Music group during 1994-95 that also led to the departure of long-serving and highly respected Warner Bros. Records executives Mo Ostin and Lenny Waronker. Following his resignation he established Krasnow Entertainment, a joint venture with the MCA Music Entertainment Group, with offices at 1755 Broadway in Manhattan. In private life, Krasnow has been a member of board of directors of New York City Center (theater for independent choreography); a member of the board of directors and president's council of the Brooklyn Academy of Music; co- president of the French Music Office; national committee member of the March of Dimes; executive vice-president of the Paul Taylor Dance Company; and a member of board of directors of the Wadleigh School (New York) and a co founder of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

The documentary combines interviews with archival footage and photographs of the Slovak Republic in order to provide a brief history of the state, exploring the rise of antisemitism and how it affected these Jewish soldiers. Summary ‚ÄúEverywhere there were fleas and bugs. We slept in barns,‚Äù remembers one former soldier, ‚Äúthe work was very hard‚ÄîI worked with a pick ax and shovel. The foreman threatened that we would be sent away to Poland if we didn't achieve the quota.‚Äù Forced to take on grueling construction projects for the army, these Jews were treated as a lower class of soldiers who constantly faced the possibility of being deported to Nazi concentration camps. In 1939, Adolf Hitler suggested that the Slovak Republic split from Czechoslovakia or be occupied by German forces. After a unanimous vote in their parliament, the Slovak Republic was formed. But the new nation, small and impressionable, became a puppet for Nazi Germany. The first Prime Minister, Jozef Tiso, spouted anti-Semitic statements that echoed Hitler. ‚ÄúIs it not humane if the Slovak people want to get rid of their perpetual enemy‚Äîthe Jew? Is it not Christian?‚Äù Answering his own question, he continued ‚ÄúThe precept of love to thy self is God given, and this command for love for myself commands me to get rid of everything that is harmful to me‚Äîeverything that threatens my life... We act according to God's will. Slovak! Get rid of thy pest!‚Äù Strong antisemitic propaganda was also spread in newspapers and magazines, paving the way for deportations and the systematic extermination of Eastern European Jewry during the Holocaust. Then, young, able bodied Jewish men were forced to serve in the army. They were discriminated against and most of their service was spent building infrastructure for the state. ‚ÄúWe took the pick axes and shovels we had cleaned the day before and went to dig the canal,‚Äù remembers one soldier, ‚Äúit was a hard and exhausting job.‚Äù Many of the bridges and streets they built are still in use. The documentary shares their private stories. Often, instead of being applauded for good deeds, the soldiers were simply subject to more antisemitism. While off duty, one young soldier leaped into a river to save a girl from drowning. Once she was safe and on shore, a crowd formed around the two of them. When the mob began to whisper that he was a Jew, and grew suspicious of his association with the girl, the soldier became fearful for his own life, refused to disclose his name, and ran away. The Jewish soldiers of the Sixth Battalion witnessed the atrocities of war from many angles. In addition to facing the grueling hardships of military life, they experienced prejudice themselves and watched helplessly as their friends and family members were deported. Their ability to work and remain useful to the state saved their own lives, but experiencing incredible inhumanity filled them with rage and sorrow.

It had offices in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region. In August 2011, Dell completed the acquisition of Force10 and changed the name to Dell Force10. In mid 2013, the Force10 designation was dropped from the products in favor of the data center networking line of the Dell Networking brand, and some of the other product lines were sold.  History = Founding  The company was founded by PK Dubey, Naresh Nigam and Som Sikdar. It was named by founder Som Sikdar, an avid sailor, after Beaufort Force 10 (Storm, Whole gale) on the Beaufort scale for wind speeds, indicating a storm with high speed winds, and matched their focus on 10 Gigabit Ethernet switching and routing products.  Acquisition  In January 2009, Force10 was acquired by Turin Networks (Founded by Philip Yim), which had previously purchased Carrier Access Corporation and White Rock Networks. Carrier Access Corporation itself had previously purchased Mangrove Systems and White Rock Networks had previously purchased Seranoa Networks. On July 20, 2011 Dell announced it intended to fully acquire Force10 for an undisclosed amount. With the acquisition, Dell offered products for the data center where Dell focuses on the Ethernet switches. Dell Force10 continued to offer their non-Ethernet backhaul and metro-access platforms as well. Telmar Network Technology of Plano, Texas, announced the acquisition of the Force10 Turin transport product lines from Dell in May, 2013, and has resumed support and development of the Traverse, TraverseEdge, TransAccess, TransNav, MasterSeries, Adit, Wide Bank, and Broadmore products.Telmar Acquires Dell‚Äôs Carrier Transport and Access Business http://telmarnetworkblog.com/2013/05/21/telmar-acquires-dells- carrier-transport-and-access-business/ Telmar Network Technology, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Jabil Circuit, Inc. of St. Petersburg, FL. iQor of St. Petersburg, FL, announced, in December 2013, the acquisition of the Jabil/Telmar Network Technology Aftermarket Services business, including the extended life products (from Alcatel, DECS, Force10/Turin, Transport Access products) and all of Telmar Network Technology.

Force10 Networks hoped to expand from LAN switching to midsize data centers and enterprise campus networks. Force10 products included the E-Series family of switch/routers, the C300 switch, the S-Series family of access switches and the P-Series security appliances. In 2007 Force10 announced it had a patent relevant for 100 Gigabit Ethernet switching. Force10 Networks uses NetBSD as the underlying operating system that powers FTOS (the Force10 Operating System). In 2013 the name FTOS will be replaced by DNOS as the generic operating system name for all Dell Networking portfolio. Force10 made a donation to the NetBSD Foundation in 2007 to help further research and the open development community. From January 19, 2012, through mid-2013, Force10 products were available as Dell products and newly ordered products were sold with the Dell logo and colors.

The S4800 series are marketed as distribution switches for both datacenter as campus networks for large networks or (collapsed) core switches for smaller networks. The S4800 series switches can be stacked using either 10Gbit/s or 40Gbit/s ports using fiber links or copper/twinax based direct attached ports. The pass-through latency ranges from 800 nano seconds for the S4810 to 3,3 micro seconds for the copper based S4820. The S4810, S4820 and the MXL or M-I/O switches use the Broadcom Trident+ ASIC. This is the same ASIC as used in the Dell PowerConnect 8100 series but running the FTOS operating system, while the PowerConnect 8100 series runs a Broadcom built firmware. In June 2013 the S5000 series switches were announced. This switch was the first switch to display the new brand name Dell Networking and the new name for FTOS: Dell Networking Operating System or DNOS.

He is a Professor of Physics and former Chairman of the Physics Department of Bar-Ilan University. Biography Aviezer was born in Switzerland in 1935 and raised in the United States. He received his doctorate in physics from the University of Chicago, and subsequently held a research position at the University of Illinois in the research group of Professor John Bardeen, the only person ever to be awarded two Nobel Prizes in physics. He was then invited to join the research group at the IBM Watson Research Center near New York headed by Professor Leo Esaki, who was also a Nobel Prize winner. In 1967, Aviezer and his wife Dvora made aliyah to Israel. He is the author of 140 scientific articles on solid state physics. In recognition of his important research contributions, he was honored by being elected as a Fellow of the American Physical Society (1984). In addition to his scientific research, Aviezer has a long-standing involvement in Torah and science and he has written three books on the subject: \\"In the Beginning\\" (translated into nine languages),\\"Fossils and Faith\\" (translated into four languages), \\"Modern Science and Ancient Faith\\" (recently published). For several decades, Aviezer has received invitation to lecture on the subject of Torah and science throughout the world. Aviezer also gives a course in Torah and science at Bar-Ilan University. In 1999, his course was awarded the prestigious Templeton Prize. Aviezer continues to give lectures on Torah and science throughout Israel as well as abroad. Views on creation and evolution Aviezer is particularly notable for being one of very few modern writers from the religious Jewish perspective to publish on the subject of Torah and science, using the language of science and rejecting creationism. Aviezer allows for divine guidance within an evolutionary paradigm in the transmutation of species over time, including the emergence of modern man. He interprets the six days of creation as broadly referring to large periods of time, an interpretation for which he cites rabbinic sources, including Maimonides and Nachmanides, citing in particular the problem with defining the several \\"days\\" of creation that precede the creation of the Sun, according to the Biblical narrative.

Rugby career The first Welsh team, Mann is sat in the middle row, far right, February 1881 In 1881 Newport Athletic secretary Richard Mullock needed to quickly form a Welsh team to face England after a successful application to the Rugby Football Union. He turned to two of Wales' main rugby clubs, Newport and Cardiff, to form the bulk of the team. Mann was vice-captain of Cardiff RFC during the 1880/81 season and was one of four players that represented Cardiff during the period to make up the first Wales team; the other three members were Leonard Watkins, Barry Girling and William David Phillips.Smith (1980), pg 40. The Welsh team was poorly organised before the game began, with no trial games organised, and a group of players who had very little experience of each other's style of play. Many members of the team were picked on their college background or the geographic location of their club. The game began poorly when Mann and Lewis were both injured after just ten minutes of the match and eventually had to leave the field.Smith (1980), pg 57. The game ended in humiliation for the Welsh team, with England winning by eight goals to nil.Smith (1980), pg 56.

Content value Content itself is what the user derives value from. Thus, \\"content\\" can refer to the information provided through the medium, the way in which the information was presented, as well as the added features included in the medium in which that information was delivered. The medium, however, provides little to no value to the end-user without the information and experiences that make up the content. Communication theory philosopher Marshall McLuhan famously coined the phrase, \\"The medium is the message.\\"McLuhan, Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (MIT Press, 1964, 1994) p. 7. In the case of content, the channel through which information is delivered, the \\"medium\\", affects how the end user perceives content, the \\"message\\". Another important thing about content, especially when it comes to professional content writing, is the value that you deliver. Unless your content is useful to the readers, it is not going to be useful to you or your brand. The author, producer, or publisher of an original source of information or experiences may or may not be directly responsible for the entire value that they attain as content in a specific context. For example, part of an original article (such as a headline from a news story) may be rendered on another web page displaying the results of a user's search engine query grouped with headlines from other news publications and related advertisements. The value that the original headline has in this group of query results from the search engine as a medium may be very different from the value that it had as message content in its original article. Content also leads to influencing other people in creating their own content, sometimes in a way that the original author did not or could not plan or imagine. This feature, adding the option of user innovation in a medium, means that users can develop their own content from existing content. Much social media content is derived in this way, by effectively re-cycling content in a slightly different format. Technological effects on content Traditionally, content was edited and tailored to the public through news editors, authors, and other kinds of content creators. However, not all information content requires creative authoring or editing. Through recent technological developments, truth is found in philosopher Marshall McLuhan's idea of a global village; new technologies allow for instantaneous movement of information from every corner to every point at the same timeMcLuhan, Marshall. Letters of Marshall McLuhan. (Oxford University Press, 1987) p254. causing the globe to be contracted into a village by electric technology,McLuhan, Marshall. Understanding Media. (Gingko Press, 1964, 2003) p6. such as smartphones and automated sensors. These new technologies can record events anywhere for publishing and converting in order to potentially reach a global audience through various internet channels such as YouTube. Such recorded or transmitted information and visuals can be referred to as content. Content is no longer a product of only reputable sources; new technology has made primary sources of content more readily available to all. For example, a video of a politician giving a speech compared to an article written by a reporter who witnessed the speech. Media production and delivery technology may potentially enhance the value of content by formatting, filtering, and combining original sources of content for new audiences with new contexts. The greatest value for a given source of content for a specific audience is often found through such electronic reworking of content as dynamic and real-time as the trends that fuel its interest. Less emphasis on value from content stored for possible use in its original form, and more emphasis on rapid re-purposing, reuse, and redeployment has led many publishers and media producers to view their primary function less as originators and more as transformers of content. Thus, one finds out that institutions, that used to focus on publishing printed materials, are now publishing both databases and software to combine content from various sources for a wider variety of audiences. Criticism While the marketing and media world have broadly accepted the term \\"content\\", some writers complain about its inherent vulnerability towards misinterpretation. Others assert that the term devalues the work of authors or sets up a false analogy of information as material objects which biases any discussion using the word, See also * Advertising * Authoring * Content adaptation * Content designer * Content farm * Content format * Content management * Content management system * Content writing services * Enterprise content management * Free content * Geotargeting * Media transparency * Open content * User-generated content * Web content management system * Digital Marketing References Category:Publishing Category:Occupations ","title":"Content (media)"},{"id":"12766839","text":"All Terrain Walkers are armoured fighting vehicles from the Star Wars universe that traverse the landscape on mechanical legs. They are used by the Old Republic, the Galactic Empire, and the First Order for ground assault, reconnaissance or transport. Throughout the saga walkers have played a pivotal role in the fate of characters and the outcome of battles. Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) is responsible for their animation and design, often using models, stop-motion animation, and relevant matte paintings to depict their presence in the films. There are a variety of walkers: The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi introduces the All Terrain Armored Transport (AT-AT) and All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST). Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith and The Clone Wars introduced earlier Clone Wars-era models of walkers, such as the All-Terrain Tactical Enforcer (AT-TE), and the All Terrain Recon Transports (AT-RT). The Star Wars Legends continuity features numerous walker variants, several which have been merchandised in popular culture, while the later films Rogue One and Star Wars: The Last Jedi depicted, respectively, the former the AT-ACT variant to the standard AT-AT, the latter a restyled AT-AT for its new and more modern setting, and a new, even larger walker known as the AT-M6. All Terrain Armored Transport (AT-AT) The All Terrain Armored Transport, or walker, is a quadruped mechanized infantry combat vehicle used by the Imperial ground forces. Standing over tall with blast-impervious armour plating, these massive constructs are used as much for psychological effect as they are for tactical advantage. The AT-AT (pronounced either casually as 'at at', or using only the letters ) was first introduced in The Empire Strikes Back (as the Galactic Empire's main units against Rebel Alliance infantry during the Battle of Hoth) and also appears in Return of the Jedi (as the vehicle used to transport Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader to their shuttle on the forest moon of Endor) and in Rogue One (in the AT-ACT variant, used to respond to the attacks of Rebel infantrymen of the Rogue One unit during the Battle of Scarif, although later defeated by the arriving Rebel Red Squadron of starfighers). The also appears in a destroyed form in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, explained in the video game Star Wars Battlefront (2015) to be a residue of the Battle of Jakku, which was the Empire's last defeat and resulted in its dissolution. Modified forms appear in The Last Jedi (used by the First Order to attack Resistance forces in a former Rebel base). Origin and design Joe Johnston's original design for the Empire's war machines was a giant, multi-wheeled vehicle; this design later became the \\"Juggernaut\\" in West End Games' roleplaying material, and the design was reworked into the clone turbo tank for Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith. Johnston said Lucas wanted the walkers to look like anthropomorphic walking tanks to make them frightening. For The Empire Strikes Back, however, the final design was a four-legged walker. Inspiration for the came from Paraceratherium, an extinct genus of rhinoceros and the largest land mammal in history. George Lucas later dismissed claims that the design was inspired by container cranes at the Port of Oakland (across San Francisco Bay from ILM's San Rafael offices), calling it a \\"myth\\"; animator Phil Tippett told the San Francisco Chronicle the same thing. ILM created models ranging from in height. ILM filmed the using stop- motion animation against matte paintings created by Michael Pangrazio because attempts at compositing miniature footage against live-action background footage yielded mediocre results. Additionally, ILM studied elephants to determine the best way to animate the four-legged . Although the stop-motion animation style gave the a jerky, \\"staccato-like\\" effect on film, ILM found this movement acceptable because of the mechanical nature. The sound of the AT-AT walking was created by sound designer Ben Burtt by using the sound of a punch press. Depiction Dialog in National Public Radio's adaptation of The Empire Strikes Back says that \\"look like animals\\"; the character goes on to describe the vehicles as carrying \\"extremely heavy armor and armaments\\". The , designed to favor \\"fear over function\\", can carry up to five speeder bikes and 40 Imperial stormtroopers. The head/cockpit armament consists of two side-mounted medium blaster cannons and two chin-mounted heavy laser cannons. It is manned by two Drivers, which are combat drivers specialized in operating the Imperial Army's walkers, wore distinct battle armour, similar in design to that of a modified basic Stormtrooper. The drivers operated the walker's movement and firing controls, and are overseen by a commander who sits behind them in the cockpit. Manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards, Expanded Universe sources describe the as being either or tall. The rate of stride is not fast, but this fact is mitigated by the immense height of its legs. They can outrun opponents that underestimate walking speed, while their neck can pivot quickly enough to bring their heavy weaponry to bear against even fast-moving craft like snowspeeders. Their blasters and laser cannons do not have a high rate of fire, but the shots are powerful enough to destroy most small targets in one to two shots. Their armor is resistant to most standard blaster weapons; however, the \\"neck\\" column of the walker holds no such invulnerability and, if shot, can cause the entire walker to be destroyed. The AT-AT is the primary assault vehicle during the Battle of Hoth, first depicted in The Empire Strikes Back. In the film, the squadron of , lead by General Maximilian Veers, are responsible for destroying the shield generator protecting the Rebel headquarters, taking out soldiers, artillery batteries, and snowspeeders in the process. Luke Skywalker, realizing that the walkers are all but impervious to artillery and snowspeeder blaster fire, orders his squadron's snowspeeders to entangle their legs with tow cables, a trick he remembered using on Tatooine to rein in hard-to-control farm animals. Wedge Antilles and his gunner Wes Janson successfully bring down an AT-AT using the tow cable: shortly after, another snowspeeder scores a direct hit on the fallen AT-AT's neck, causing a huge explosion. Skywalker, after being shot down and narrowly escaping his stricken snowspeeder before it is crushed beneath the AT-AT's leg, used his hoist cable to latch upon that AT-AT's underside, with a slash of his Lightsaber cutting away a panel so he can toss a thermal detonator inside, causing a series of internal explosions culminating with the cockpit and the walker toppling over. In the novelization of The Empire Strikes Back, General Veers' is destroyed when its cockpit is rammed by a snowspeeder piloted by Derek \\"Hobbie\\" Klivian, however this never made it into the final cut of the film. An AT-AT makes a brief appearance in Return of the Jedi; one walks up alongside a landing platform on Endor to deliver Luke to Darth Vader. The first appearance of an in the Star Wars Rebels TV series occurs in the second-season episode \\"Relics of the Old Republic\\", when Agent Kallus unsuccessfully confronts the rebels while on Seelos, with a trio of the four- legged walkers challenging Captain Rex's retired clone cohorts and their own much-modified six-legged walker, where the rebels are hiding out. This walker is significantly bigger than those seen in the films and depicts an earlier model. A ruined appears in Star Wars: The Force Awakens as the makeshift home of the scavenger Rey on the planet Jakku. The First Order uses an updated model of the AT-AT during the Battle of Crait at the end of Star Wars: The Last Jedi alongside a similar but larger walker called the AT-M6. The theme park attraction Star Wars: Rise of the Resistance, set after The Last Jedi, features two full-sized AT-ATs in a hangar bay. These walkers, while mostly static, can move their cannons to allow for a scene in which the walker's drivers spot the ride vehicles and fire at them. All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST) The All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST) is a two-legged mech walker introduced briefly in The Empire Strikes Back and featured extensively in Return of the Jedi. These vehicles were designed to screen and protect the flanks of slower moving AT-ATs and the larger tanks used by the Empire. Due to their design and movement, they are often dubbed as a \\"chicken walker\\". The name Scout Walker is also used to refer to an . This name was used for the official toy instead of the name. An AT-ST also appears briefly in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, patrolling Jedha City following an attack by Saw Gerrera's forces. A modified AT-ST later appears in The Mandalorian under the possession of a group of raiders, as the Empire has ceased to exist by the time of the series. An updated model of the AT-ST is used by the First Order in The Last Jedi. Shortly before the film's climax, an AT-ST is commandeered by BB-8. Origin and design A single AT-ST makes a brief appearance in The Empire Strikes Back alongside the larger during the Battle of Hoth. The was meant to have more screen time; however, one scene depicting a snowspeeder shooting at the model was ruined when the set's background shifted. For Return of the Jedi, ILM made the design more detailed. Numerous models were created, including a full-sized for on-location shooting. Director Richard Marquand and producer Robert Watts had cameos as operators for the scene in which Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and a pair of Ewoks commandeer an AT-ST. Lee Seiler sued Lucasfilm in the mid-1980s, claiming that the infringed on his copyright on what he called a \\"Garthian Strider\\", which he said he created in 1976 or 1977. The case was dismissed with the court noting that not only did Seiler not produce the supposed drawings at trial, but that the copyright came one year after The Empire Strikes Back debuted.Seiler v. Lucasfilm, Ltd., 613 F.Supp. 1253 (1984), affirmed, 808 F.2d 1316 (1986). Retrieved 10 Aug. 2013. Depiction Star Wars guidebooks describe the as a \\"reconnaissance or defensive vehicle [that] is lightweight and built for speed\\". Their agility allows them to defend the larger slower AT-ATs or support other Imperial ground forces. Two , with their legs folded up, can be carried inside the cargo hold of an . are tall (although some sources describe them as ) and seat a pilot and co-pilot. are armed with laser cannons on the \\"chin\\" and sides, feet claws for destroying small defenses, and side-mounted concussion missile launchers. In The Empire Strikes Back, an scouts for and supports the slower during the Battle of Hoth. Video games recreating the Battle of Hoth feature numerous AT-STs which are vulnerable to snowspeeder blasters unlike the larger AT-ATs. During the ground skirmish of the Battle of Endor in Return of the Jedi, after initially taking heavy casualties from four , the protagonists and the local Ewok tribes destroy several and commandeer another one; the precariously balanced nature proves highly vulnerable to the Ewoks' primitive booby traps. Their armor is also significantly weaker than that of the AT- AT's: their own lasers proved sufficient to completely destroy one, and another one was crushed by two large tree trunks launched against it. In the Expanded Universe, AT-STs are often featured in Imperial attack forces. Some more advanced Imperial walker designs have been influenced by the . Video games such as Star Wars: Rogue Squadron and Shadows of the Empire (in a much expanded Battle of Hoth) include numerous , and these can be destroyed by direct shooting from the player's craft, in contrast to the heavily armored which have to be tripped by tow cables. are also player-controllable units in several real-time strategy games. The so-named \\"All Terrain Defense Pod\\" () depicted in Star Wars Rebels was used by the Empire on Lothal, Ezra Bridger's homeworld, to enforce their will against the planet's inhabitants during the first season of the series. It is stated as being among the fastest-moving \\"walkers\\" of any of the variants, and is only lightly armed with a single, forward-aimed energy cannon. In episode 208 of Mythbusters, the Build Team (Grant Imahara, Kari Byron and Tory Belleci tested the plausibility of the scene in Return of the Jedi wherein a swinging log trap destroyed an AT-ST. The team determined that the logs in the scene each weighed approximately and were swung at a 45 degree angle at the walker, impacting with the energy equivalent of around two megajoules. To test this in real life, the team created a swinging log rig out of telephone poles and, after shoring the structure up with steel reinforcement, swung replica logs at an armored truck. The team declared the myth plausible when the logs succeeded in punching the truck's side panels off its frame. All Terrain Tactical Enforcer (AT-TE) The All Terrain Tactical Enforcer, or AT-TE walker, is a mechanized infantry combat vehicle used by the Grand Army of the Republic ground forces. Having six grappling legs and a low centre of gravity, this armoured walker could navigate any terrain ‚Äì even climbing vertical cliffs. It appears in Attack of the Clones, Revenge of the Sith, The Clone Wars multimedia campaign, Star Wars Battlefront II and in the early episodes from the second season of Star Wars Rebels. Origin and design Conceived by Ryan Church as a predecessor to the AT-AT, the AT-TE's animation for Attack of the Clones was supervised by Rob Coleman. Tom St. Amand, who worked on the AT-AT scenes in The Empire Strikes Back, provided his experience to create a similar appearance for the AT-TE. Depiction AT-TEs are depicted as assault vehicles that appear at the Battle of Geonosis, as depicted in Attack of the Clones and various Clone Wars media. It has magnetic feet, which allows it to scale steep embankments if they are magnetic, like the mesa on Teth in Star Wars: The Clone Wars. The low profile, six legs and overall flexibility made it vulnerable to IEDs and reduced its acceleration and maximum speed, but lowered its center of gravity closer to the surface it was traversing, traverse speed, mobility and stability; moreover, its low speed allows it to walk through energy shields. The vehicles are well-armed with laser turrets, a powerful mass driver cannon, and protected by heavy electromagnetic armor. AT-TEs are manufactured by Rothana Heavy Engineering, a subdivision of Kuat Drive Yards (who manufacture many of the other walkers). AT-TEs have the distinct tactical advantage, common among many of the Old Republic's larger walkers, of being able to be carried into combat by LAAT/C dropships. This allows their swift deployment to the battlefront from distant landing zones and ground bases.Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones In any case, a well-deployed and utilized AT-TE would win in a battle against an AT-AT (as it did on Seelos, in the Star Wars Rebels second season episode Relics of the Old Republic) List of Star Wars walkers Many vehicles were created for various Star Wars media and depicted as technological evolutionary predecessors and successors to the walkers featured in the original trilogy.  In film and television  ;Utilized by the Republic, Empire and First Order *All Terrain Attack Pod (AT-AP): Featured in Revenge of the Sith and Clone Wars media, as a variation of the AT-PT. Alex Jaeger designed the AT-AP per Lucas' request to \\"diversify the Clone armor\\". Nicknamed the \\"sniper tank\\", the AT-AP features a variety of artillery weapons, a retractable third leg for stability, and other offensive features. *All Terrain Open Transport (AT-OT): Introduced in Revenge of the Sith and other sources, is a heavily armored transport whose open design makes it vulnerable from above. The AT-OT can transport 34 clone troopers, who are protected by thick armor and four laser cannons. During the late stages of Revenge of the Sith's development, it was called the \\"Clone CAT walker\\". *All Terrain Recon Transports (AT-RT): Introduced in Revenge of the Sith operated by clone troopers searching for Yoda (Frank Oz) on Kashyyyk. The AT-RT is described as a precursor to the AT-ST, though it also shares similarities to the AT-PTs of the same era. A scene cut from Revenge of the Sith would have shown Yoda distracting clone troopers while Chewbacca removes them from their AT-RT in a manner similar to how he obtains control of an AT-ST in Return of the Jedi. AT-RT animators studied AT-ST movement to recreate part of the \\"original funkiness of movement\\" caused by the stop-animation style used in the original trilogy. *All Terrain Defense Pod (AT-DP): Introduced in Star Wars Rebels, the AT-DP is described by Star Wars references as a successor to the AT-RT, combining speed with an armored cockpit to protect a pilot and gunner. Standing high and weighing , the AT-DP can reach speeds of . Because it is only armed with a single Kyuzo Maad-38 heavy laser cannon, the Empire primarily uses AT-DPs for defensive purposes like policing or sentry duty. *All Terrain Mobile Artillery (AT-MA): Introduced in The Force Awakens, the AT-MA is a model of quadruped base defense walker used by the First Order to defended Starkiller Base. While it resembled the All Terrain Armored Transport once used by the Galactic Empire in terms of size and weaponry, the AT-MA was primarily designed for defense, rather than transport or assault. Several of these walkers were deployed across the planet to protect its installations, and at least three of them were present during General Armitage Hux's speech before the destruction of the Hosnian system. Several AT-MAs were portrayed in the ground vehicles storage area of a Resurgent-class Star Destroyer. *All Terrain Armoured Cargo Transport (AT-ACT): Introduced in Rogue One, these walkers are slightly larger than the standard AT-AT, with a hollowed-out center section that can hold a cargo container. Director Gareth Edwards instructed the film's concept artists to design walkers based on their idealized memory of the AT-AT. According to background material, the AT-ACT was built for hauling cargo at Imperial construction sites and research facilities. Larger than AT-ATs at tall, an AT-ACT's central container can hold of cargo. Although not meant for use on the battlefield, the AT-ACT is heavily armored against most handheld weapons and equipped with two Taim & Bak MS-2 heavy laser cannons, allowing it to be deployed into combat in an emergency.Walker (2018), p. 65Barr, et al. (2019), p. 326 *All Terrain MegaCaliber Six (AT-M6): Featured in The Last Jedi, the AT-M6 is a class of walking siege-artillery vehicles used by the First Order. In-universe sources identify the -tall walker's primary weapon as a MegaCaliber Six turbolaser cannon mounted on its back. This cannon is described as being powerful enough to punch through deflector shields rated to withstand planetary bombardments. The walker's front legs are meant to support the weight of the cannon and withstand its recoil, which combined with its hunched back gives it the overall appearance of a simian. Additional weapons include two heavy dual laser cannons and two medium anti-ship laser cannons.Walker (2018), p. 66Barr, et al. (2019), p. 341 *All Terrain Heavy Hauler (AT-HH): Featured in The Last Jedi, utilizing many more legs than most walkers to allow it to tow heavy cargo. * All Terrain Heavy Scout (AT-HS): A model of walker fielded by the First Order. The LEGO version of the AT-HS was based on a piece of concept art for The Last Jedi which, although canon, was ultimately not used in the final cut of the film. * All Terrain Cold-weather Mobile Heavy Cannon (AT-CMHC): A remodeled variant of the Umbaran UMHC used by the Imperial Military. This prototype model was specialized in sub-zero temperatures.Star Wars: Commander ;Utilized by other factions * Umbaran mobile heavy cannon (UMHC): Used by Umbarans during the Clone Wars. Later, both the Imperial Army and Alliance to Restore the Republic used them during the Galactic Civil War. MHCs were heavily armored and had an articulated electromagnetic plasma cannon mounted on top of its dome-like body.  In Expanded Universe media  *All Terrain Personnel Transport (AT-PT): Introduced during the climax of Timothy Zahn's novel Dark Force Rising, is a two-legged, one-person vehicle designed for the Old Republic as a \\"personal weapons platform for ground soldiers.\\" The AT-PT is equipped with two blaster cannons, a concussion grenade launcher, and an array of sensors. The AT-PT is also featured in several video games, including Star Wars: Rogue Squadron, Star Wars: Force Commander, and Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds. *Mountain Terrain Armored Transport (MT-AT): Introduced in Jedi Academy Trilogy, dubbed \\"spider walkers\\", are octrupedalism specially for mountain terrain. *All Terrain Anti-Aircraft (AT-AA): Featured in various Expanded Universe media, is a four-legged anti-aircraft vehicle used by the Galactic Empire. The All Terrain Advance Raider (AT-AR) appears in Marvel Comics' Star Wars series and an All Terrain Experimental Transport (AT-XT) appears in LucasArts' Star Wars: The Clone Wars game.Star wars clone wars manual DK Publishing's Attack of the Clones: Incredible Cross-Sections book mentions an All Terrain Heavy Enforcer. Merchandise Kenner released AT-AT and AT-ST toys as part of their Empire Strikes Back line, and Hasbro released toys based on those molds when the Special Edition trilogy was distributed. Micro Machines also released AT-AT, AT-ST, and AT-TE toys. Both Decipher Inc. and Wizards of the Coast published AT-AT and AT-ST cards for their Star Wars Customizable Card Game and Star Wars Trading Card Game, respectively. Lego has released AT-AT, AT-ST, AT-DP, AT-AP, AT-OT, AT-RT, AT-TE, AT-M6, and AT-HS models.

Ritz, \\"Remembering March Laumer,\\" The Baum Bugle, Vol. 44 No. 1 (Spring 2000), p. 11. March Laumer was born in Birmingham, Alabama, the son of an officer in the U.S. Army Air Corps. He was the older brother of science fiction writer Keith Laumer; their youngest brother Frank was also a writer, on historical subjects. March Laumer graduated from the University of Missouri, and taught abroad, including in Ying Wa College (1965‚Äì67) in Hong Kong and Turkey. Much of his maturity was spent between residences in Florida and Lund, Sweden. March began writing his Oz books in 1962 (one year before the publication of the fortieth and last \\"official\\" Oz book, Merry Go Round in Oz). He was a frequent correspondent of Ruth Plumly Thompson until her death in 1976. Most of Laumer's books were published by his own small press, Opium Books, in Hong Kong, or Vanitas Press in Lund, Sweden, often with illustrations by Lau Shiu Fan. Laumer's books often make drastic changes to the series and involve adult themes that have led some fans to label them pornography based on some oblique and non-negative references to bestiality and pederasty in The Green Dolphin of Oz (1978), his best known and most widely circulated book, as well as the first to be published. Many of his manuscripts were works in progress for many years, and some of them may have been discarded. Laumer wrote his books set at specific periods of time, some of them projected into the future. He also incorporated characters and events from the Magic Land books of Alexander Melentyevich Volkov, particularly in Aunt Em and Uncle Henry in Oz: A Traditional Tale of Oz: a darker, more extreme companion piece telling essentially the same story as his more Baumian Uncle Henry and Aunt Em in Oz: The Oz Book for 1911, as well as his apocalyptic conclusions to the series, The Ten Woodmen of Oz: The Oz Book for 1999, and A Farewell to Oz: The Oz Book for 2000.

In November 1984, six PQ Members of the National Assembly of Quebec (MNAs) resigned from the Cabinet. They were soon followed by other legislators who crossed the floor to sit as Independents. Point de Mire sur Ren√© L√©vesque, √âpisode 10 : Le d√©part, Radio- Canada Consequences The PQ‚Äôs majority in the National Assembly almost completely vanished. It had started the term with 80 MNAs. By the end of the term, it was reduced to only 60 MNAs. On June 3, 1985, the PQ lost a series of four by-elections, managing to finish third in the district of L‚ÄôAssomption, behind Progressive Conservative Party of Quebec Leader Andr√© Asselin, with only 20% of the vote. Eventually, the incident resulted in the resignation of Premier Ren√© L√©vesque. In September 1985, a party leadership election chose Pierre-Marc Johnson, another moderate, as his successor. However, the PQ lost the 1985 election and by 1987, the party‚Äôs radical wing pressured Johnson into quitting. Radicals were able to get Jacques Parizeau, one of their own, to take over the leadership of the party.

He is also known for seeking out and preserving war-related correspondences, distributing millions of free books to the general public throughout the United States and to U.S. troops abroad, and finding and bringing attention to unmarked but historically significant sites across America. Early life Carroll was adopted as an infant in Washington, D.C., and raised by Marea and Thomas Edmund Carroll, who helped establish the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970. Carroll attended Sidwell Friends High School, and graduated magna cum laude from Columbia University in 1993, receiving his bachelor's degree in English Literature. His older brother and only sibling, Christopher Carroll, is a professional photographer and filmmaker who was once a photo editor for the music magazine SPIN. Christopher Carroll is also a volunteer firefighter in New York, and the co-editor with his wife, Liz Mechem, of the book Legends of Country. In 1991, during his sophomore year at Columbia, Andrew Carroll wrote his first book, Volunteer USA: A Comprehensive Guide to Worthy Causes That Need You. Carroll followed it up in 1994 with Golden Opportunities: A Volunteer Guide for Americans Over 50.  The American Poetry & Literacy (APL) Project  In 1991, during his junior year at Columbia, Carroll was inspired by a lecture given at the Library of Congress by Joseph Brodsky, the Nobel Prize-winning author and Poet Laureate of the United States. Brodsky recommended that free poetry books should be widely disseminated to the American public. Carroll wrote to Brodsky offering to help start the initiative, and, after meeting in 1992, they launched what Carroll named: the American Poetry & Literacy (APL) Project, a nonprofit organization that would distribute free poetry books to the general public. Carroll persuaded the Book-of-the-Month Club to donate to the APL Project thousands of copies of the book, SIX AMERICAN POETS: An Anthology, edited by Joel Conarroe, which featured poems by Robert Frost, Emily Dickinson, Langston Hughes, Wallace Stevens, Walt Whitman, and William Carlos Williams. DoubleTree was the first hotel chain to agree to place the books in its rooms. The APL Project expanded into giving away free books in schools, supermarkets, homeless shelters, senior centers, jury waiting rooms, and similar public venues. Carroll began working with Dover Publications, buying up large quantities of their inexpensive \\"thrift editions\\" and distributing specific books at certain times of the year (e.g., Great Love Poems for Valentines Day, funded by Lanc√¥me, and The Raven and Other Favorite Poems by Edgar Allan Poe for Halloween). After Joseph Brodsky died from a heart attack at the age of 55, Carroll went on a nationwide tour in Brodsky's honor and drove across the country and gave away 100,000 free books. The trip, which Carroll called \\"The Great APLseed Giveaway\\" began in April (National Poetry Month) 1998 and lasted for five weeks. The trip was sponsored by the Academy of American Poets and the Washington Apple Commission, and it was inspired by Johnny Appleseed's travels throughout the United States. DoubleTree Hotels provided Carroll with free lodging, and Ryder loaned Carroll a truck that he filled with books. Carroll drove from New York to California and handed out books at truck stops, hospitals, supermarkets, schools, bus and train stations, zoos, a White Castle hamburger restaurant in Chicago, and a casino and a 24-hour wedding chapel in Las Vegas. In 1998, Carroll convinced Amtrak to place thousands of copies of a poetry anthology, titled SONGS FOR THE OPEN ROAD: Poems of Travel and Adventure (Dover). In April 1999, Volkswagen agreed to put 40,000 poetry books provided by the APL Project in the glove compartment of its cars as they came off the assembly line.\\"Harper's Index\\", Harper's magazine, page 17. January 1999 American Airlines placed 100,000 copies of SONGS FOR THE OPEN ROAD in the seat backs of their planes in April 2000. And the Target Corporation paid the APL Project for 300,000 books to give away to their customers. Before the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the International Olympic Committee contacted Carroll and requested that he edit a special anthology of international verse that would be given to athletes and spectators. Carroll created the book A World of Poetry (Dover) which was distributed throughout Salt Lake City during the Olympics. Over the course of several years, the APL Project organized poetry events that were free and open to the public and featured prominent politicians, journalists, authors, and celebrities reading poetry. Participants included George Stephanopoulos, Cokie Roberts, Geraldine Ferraro, Ed Bradley, Susan Sontag, and Eugene McCarthy. War Letters-related books, documentaries, memorials, and exhibits While still involved with the poetry initiative,\\"The Legacy Project.\\" WarLetters.com. No date. Accessed 2009-07-15. Carroll founded the Legacy Project, a national, all-volunteer effort that worked to honor and remember America's veterans and troops by seeking out and preserving their war-related correspondences.Carroll, Andrew. War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars. Reprint ed. New York: Simon and Schuster, 2002. ; Rossi, Holly Lebowitz. \\"Letters Old and New Illuminate Faith in War's Trenches.\\" Publishers Weekly. February 14, 2007.Salamon, Julie. \\"The Troops at the Front as Poets for Future Readers.\\" The New York Times. November 9, 2001. Carroll was inspired to create the Legacy Project after his family's home in Washington, D.C., burned down during his sophomore year of college and destroyed most of his and his family's personal memorabilia and correspondence.Lacher, Irene. \\"Legacy of Pen, Sword.\\" Los Angeles Times. February 17, 2002. In 1997, Carroll edited his first The New York Times bestseller, Letters of a Nation: A Collection of Extraordinary American Letters (with an introduction by Marian Wright Edelman), which features more than 200 letters written by famous and not-so-famous individuals from the past 350 years. Some of the letters, including one by a Navajo Code Talker, had never been published before. In the summer of 1998, Carroll contacted Dear Abby, who frequently promoted causes that helped troops and veterans, and asked her to write a column requesting that people share with the Legacy Project any war-related letters they had written or had received from loved ones. Abby published the column on Veterans Day in 1998 and included a post office box that Carroll had set up for people to send in their war letters.McDonald, William. \\"In Wartime Letters Home, Eloquence of Common Men.\\" The New York Times. November 11, 1999. Within a year, Carroll had received more than 15,000 letters, some of them originals, and some dating as far back as the American Revolution. News about the Legacy Project caught the attention of former CBS News correspondent Harry Smith. Smith subsequently produced a documentary about war correspondence, Dear Home: Letters From World War II, which aired on the History Channel in 1999. Director Steven Spielberg heard about Carroll's Legacy Project and asked him to find a World War II couple who would read some of their wartime love letters at a televised event, which was broadcast to millions, in front of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., on December 31, 1999, as part of the nation's millennial celebrations. In 2001, Carroll edited the book War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars, based on the correspondence collected by the Legacy Project.\\"'War Letters' Lets Soldiers Speak.\\" Pittsburgh Post- Gazette. November 11, 2001. Scribner's publishers gave Carroll a $500,000 advance for the book (money Carroll donated to veterans' groups). The book became a The New York Times bestseller.\\"Best Sellers: July 1, 2001.\\" The New York Times. July 1, 2001. All of the letters in the book were previously unpublished at the time, including letters by William T. Sherman, Clara Barton, Helen Keller, George H.W. Bush (who wrote from a submarine that had rescued him after he'd been shot down and almost killed), H. Richard Hornberger (a Korean War surgeon who later wrote the book MASH), Colin Powell, and Julia Child, who, before she became \\"the French chef,\\" served as a spy during World War II in the OSS (Office of Strategic Services, the precursor to the CIA). The audio version of War Letters, which featured famous journalists and actors (including Tom Brokaw, Rob Lowe, Noah Wyle, Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Julianna Margulies, Giovanni Ribisi, Campbell Scott, and Eric Stoltz), reading the letters, was nominated for a Grammy in the \\"Best Spoken Word\\" category in 2001. War Letters lost to Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones, read by Quincy Jones. In 2001, War Letters inspired a one-hour documentary of the same name for PBS' American Experience series. Edward Norton, Joan Allen, Esai Morales, Bill Paxton, and David Hyde Pierce were among the actors who read letters for the film, which was directed by Robby Kenner. Letters from Carroll's archive have been displayed in local and national museums throughout the United States, as well as on veterans' memorials, including in Silver Spring, Maryland, and Temecula, California. On November 11, 2005, the Legacy Project launched an exhibit titled War Letters: Lost & Found in partnership with the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum. The exhibit featured letters written in times of war that were lost or discarded by the recipients and then found by total strangers years and even decades later. Original letters from the Civil War, World War I, World War II, Korea, and Vietnam were all displayed. The letters were discovered in old barns, homes being rebuilt for new tenants, garbage bins, as well as at flea markets and estate sales. From September 2003 through March 2004, Carroll traveled to almost 40 countries around the world, including Iraq and Afghanistan, to meet with U.S. troops and to seek out more letters and emails. This journey inspired Carroll's third The New York Times bestseller, Behind the Lines: Powerful and Revealing American and Foreign War Letters‚Äîand One Man's Search to Find Them, in 2005.Wyatt, Edward. \\"Arts, Briefly: Warrior Writers.\\" The New York Times. December 16, 2005.Carroll, Andrew, ed. Behind the Lines: Powerful and Revealing American and Foreign War Letters‚Äîand One Man's Search to Find Them. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2006. . Two years later, Carroll edited Grace Under Fire: Letters of Faith in Times of War, which focused on the role of religion and spiritual beliefs in wartime.Carroll, Andrew, ed. Grace Under Fire: Letters of Faith in Times of War. New York: Doubleday, 2007. Several of Carroll's books have been translated into other languages, including Behind the Lines, which was published in Brazil as Cartos do Front: Relatos emocionantes da vida na Guerra. Since 2001, Carroll has also organized events that feature famous Americans reading war letters. Presenters have included senators, generals, actors, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, journalists, and the relatives of service members killed in action. At a May 2005 reading in New York to celebrate the publication of Behind the Lines, the author Kurt Vonnegut read a letter he had written in 1945 after surviving the firebombing of Dresden and which was published for the first time in Carroll's book. Reviving the \\"Armed Services Editions\\" In 2000, Carroll approached book publishers and encouraged them to revive the Armed Services Editions (ASEs), which were paperback books formatted to fit into a cargo pocket and distributed specifically to American troops during World War II. (Beginning in 1942, the U.S. military partnered with publishers to disseminate more than 120 million ASEs. This giveaway represented the largest free distribution of fiction and non-fiction books in the history of the world. More than 1,300 titles were published, including mysteries, biographies, crime stories, adventure novels, and classic works of literature by authors such as Ernest Hemingway, John Steinbeck, and Herman Melville. The original ASEs were discontinued in 1947.) In 2000, Carroll began working with major publishers to bring back the ASEs. Hyperion, Simon & Schuster, Random House, Oxford University Press, and Dover Publications were among the first to join together to publish and give away free ASEs to troops overseas and serving on U.S. warships. More than two million copies of the following titles were distributed: Medal of Honor: Profiles of America's Military Heroes from the Civil War to the Present, by Allen Mikaelian, with commentary by Mike Wallace (Hyperion); Henry V, by William Shakespeare (Dover); The Art of War, by Sun Tzu (Dover); Wry Martinis, by Christopher Buckley (Random House); The Man in the Arena: Selected Speeches, Letters & Essays by Theodore Roosevelt, edited by Dr. John A. Gable (Theodore Roosevelt Association); and One Thousand and One Nights, translated by Geraldine McCaughrean (Oxford University Press). The books were formatted in the same \\"cargo pocket\\" size and have the same vintage appearance as the original ASEs from World War II. Unlike the original ASEs, the new books were paid for entirely with private donations. No government funding was used. \\"Operation Homecoming\\" program, related book, and documentary In 2004, the chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), Dana Gioia, and the poet Marilyn Nelson (the daughter of a Tuskegee Airman), conceived an idea to encourage military personnel and their loved ones to write about their wartime experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan. With funding from the Boeing Company, the NEA launched \\"Operation Homecoming,\\" and encouraged active duty service members, veterans, and their families share their letters, emails, short stories, poems, and any other writings to the NEA. The NEA also held writing workshops on military bases across the country, led by bestselling authors like Tom Clancy, Mark Bowden, Jeff Shaara, and Bobbie Ann Mason. The NEA received an estimated 10,0000 pages of material, and the agency asked Carroll to edit the material into an anthology. Carroll agreed and edited the book, Operation Homecoming: Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Home Front, in the Words of U.S. Troops and Their Families, on a pro bono basis. The hardcover edition was published in September 2006 by Random House, and a paperback edition, which included additional material, was published by the University of Chicago Press in 2008. Carroll led regular writing workshops for troops and veterans on military bases and at VA hospitals, the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, and the Bagram Air Force Base in Afghanistan. Carroll also wrote, A Guide for Writers, a free, 43-page booklet published by the NEA that was created to help other workshop leaders and potential authors, including active duty troops, veterans, and their loved ones, write about the military experience. The program and book also inspired two films: One directed by Lawrence Bridges, titled Muse of Fire and features Kevin Costner and people involved in the program, either reading their written works or talking about the program's mission, and a second documentary, Operation Homecoming, directed by Richard Robbins, which was broadcast on PBS and also shown in movie theaters nationwide. Robbins' film included re-enactments of the written material along with voiceovers by prominent actors, including Robert Duvall, Aaron Echkhart, Blair Underwood, and John Krasinski. Robbins' documentary was nominated for an Oscar and won an Emmy. Here Is Where project In June 2009, Carroll launched the \\"Here Is Where\\" campaign, an all- volunteer effort to find and bring attention to unmarked historic locations throughout the United States. Carroll traveled to all 50 states to find these overlooked sites, and he chronicled his journey in the book Here is Where: Discovering America's Great Forgotten History. The sites are related to a broad range of subjects, including archaeology, art, Civil Rights, immigration, inventions, law, medical breakthroughs and discoveries, the military, religion, and science, with a special emphasis on forgotten women and minorities. Carroll has also used funds from his Here is Where book to pay for and put up plaques and signs at some of the unmarked places he found. These include: * a marker placed inside the Washington Marriott Wardman Park hotel in Washington, D.C. to honor the poet Langston Hughes, who was working as a busboy at the hotel in 1925 when he was discovered by the famous poet Vachel Lindsay. * an outdoor marker dedicated at the National Harmony Memorial Park in Hyattsville, MD, in honor of the slave Philip Reed (also spelled Reid), who built the Statue of Freedom on top of the Capitol Building. Reed had been buried in an unmarked grave, and with the help of the genealogist Megan Smolenyak and her sister, Stacy, Carroll was able to locate the spot where Reed is actually believed to have been buried. * an outdoor state marker erected along the banks of the Mississippi River in Memphis, TN, in memory of the passengers of the steamboat Sultana, who died in April 1865 when the boilers exploded and the boat burned and sank. The loss of the \\"Sultana\\" remains the greatest maritime disaster in U.S. history. Carroll funded the sign with the assistance of the local historian Jerry Potter. * a memorial bench erected at the Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn, NY, with a historical plaque in front of the unmarked grave of Dr. Thomas Holmes, the mortician who is considered to be the \\"father of embalming\\" in the United States. Holmes did not invent embalming, but he was among the first to make it widely practiced in the U.S. beginning in the Civil War. * a marker placed inside the Menger Hotel in San Antonio, TX, in honor of Adina De Zavala, a Latina preservationist who helped save the Alamo from being torn down by hotel developers. In February 1908, she barricaded herself inside the Long Barrack Fortress part of the Alamo for several days, without food or water. Her actions generated national attention, and the Alamo was preserved. * a marker placed inside a Baltimore, MD, Rite Aid store in honor of Mary K. Goddard, the publisher who risked her life during the American Revolution to print the first version of the Declaration of Independence (in January 1777) with the names of the signers on it. The store is located at 125 East Baltimore St., where Goddard's printing shop used to be. * a marker placed inside the New York Hilton Midtown hotel in Manhattan in honor of Martin Cooper, the \\"father of the cell phone.\\" Cooper was the main inventor of the first handheld cellular phone, and he made the first cell phone call in history on April 3, 1973, just outside of the Hilton on 6th Avenue, and then went into the Hilton to give a press conference about his invention. * a marker placed inside the Copper Fox Gastropub, which is part of the Courtyard by Marriott hotel (at 165 East Ontario St.) in Chicago, IL, in memory of Edward Mandell Stone. The site is where Stone's childhood home used to be, and Stone was the very first American killed in World War I. Stone had joined the French Foreign Legion in August 1914, almost four years before the United States officially entered the war in April 1917, and was killed in battle in February 1915. If All the Sky Were Paper play In November 2004, Carroll wrote an article for National Geographic magazine about his trip to almost 40 countries around the world. The article was read by a theatre professor named John Benitz at Chapman University, who contacted Carroll and suggested that Carroll's travels, along with excerpts from the letters he found, could be the basis of a play. Carroll agreed and sent Benitz a script, which Benitz workshopped with his students. Carroll picked the title, If All the Sky Were Paper, based on a sentence from a letter written by a 14-year-old Polish boy interned in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II. The play was has been performed nationwide, including at the Kirk Douglas Theatre, The Musco Center For the Arts, and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. If All the Sky Were Paper has starred Oscar and Emmy winning actors and other notable performers, among them: Laura Dern, Common, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Asner, Brad Hall, Gary Cole, Annette Bening, Jason Hall, and Michael Conner Humphreys, who played a young Forrest Gump in the 1994 film Forrest Gump and then went on to join the Army in 2004. The Center For American War Letters at Chapman University In 2013, Carroll donated his entire collection of approximately 100,000 war letters to Chapman University. Carroll and Chapman changed the name of the initiative from \\"The Legacy Project\\" to \\"The Center for American War Letters.\\" The university agreed to staff the Center, archive and catalog the letters and emails, and ensure that they will be saved in perpetuity. The correspondences are preserved in the Center for American War Letters Archive in the Leatherby Libraries. Carroll is the Center's founding director. My Fellow Soldiers book and related Smithsonian exhibit In April 2017, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the United States of America's official entry into World War I, Carroll published My Fellow Soldiers: General John Pershing and the Americans Who Won the Great War. The book includes previously unpublished letters by Pershing, including several that relate to the fire that killed Pershing's wife and three young daughters at the Presidio, while Pershing was stationed at Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas. Also in April 2017, PBS aired a three-part documentary on World War I, titled The Great War, and Carroll was featured in the film talking about General Pershing and other aspects of the war. Carroll also proposed and helped to curate, with the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum, an exhibit titled My Fellow Soldiers. The exhibit included letters written by service members and their loved ones before, during, and after World War I. Original letters by Pershing were also included. Awards and honors Carroll has received, among other accolades: the Daughters of the American Revolution's \\"Medal of Honor\\" award; \\"The Order of Saint Maurice,\\" bestowed by the National Infantryman's Association; the \\"Young Alumni Achievement Award,\\" presented by Carroll's alma mater, Columbia University; the IONA Senior Service's \\"President's Award\\"; and the National Endowment for the Arts' \\"Chairman's Medal,\\" the highest award given by the NEA Chairman. Several mayors and city councils have also proclaimed \\"Andrew Carroll\\" day in their respective cities.

The band consisted of five members who met at the University of Delaware. The band was formerly known as Omnisoul. Biography Omnisoul started with singer/songwriter Derek Fuhrmann, who found keyboardist Jamie Orlando, bassist Josh Berger, guitarist Wayne Silver, and drummer Tyler Ingersoll to join him. They named themselves Omnisoul, and Silver left as they were joined by guitarist Shawn Manigly. Fuhrmann and Orlando took music management courses to try to direct their band in the correct direction. During their first real gig, they won a Battle of the Bands at the University of Delaware. In addition, Omnisoul caught the eye of WSTW, Delaware's Top 40 radio station, with their song \\"Waiting (Save Your Life)\\". The song spent 29 consecutive nights as the #1 most-requested song. To this day, the band still holds the station record. This led to the song's inclusion on the TV show Joan of Arcadia (CBS) and on the Fantastic Four Soundtrack, as well as placement in the movie. The band's song \\"Not Giving Up\\" was featured in EA Sports' Madden 2007 video game. The song originally gained recognition while being played in sports stadiums around the country. The band worked with producer Gregg Wattenberg (Five for Fighting) and engineer Greg Gordon (Jet, Oasis) for their album, which was released in October 2007. On July 16, 2007, they released a bulletin on MySpace stating that they are changing their band name to The Crash Motive. This read: > Hi everyone, we would like to fill you in on some very exciting news. > Starting now, our band will be known as ‚ÄúThe Crash Motive‚Äù. We‚Äôre incredibly > excited about our new name and our new album. We can‚Äôt wait for you to hear > the recordings.

All of our current friends will change over to the new page! In November 2008, they announced that the band would come to an end due to the departure of frontman Fuhrman.

Early life and education Israel Halperin was born in Toronto, Ontario, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants Solomon Halperin and Fanny Lundy. Halperin attended Malvern Collegiate Institute, Victoria University in the University of Toronto, graduated from the University of Toronto in 1932, and later was a graduate student of John von Neumann at Princeton University, where he received his doctorate in mathematics. Early career After completing his doctorate in mathematics at Princeton, Halperin took a faculty position at Queen's University beginning in 1939. Halperin joined the Canadian Army in 1942, serving until 1945 in Ottawa with the Canadian Armament Research and Development Establishment (CARDE). He then returned to Queen's.Beck (February 2008), p. 16. Arrest and release In February 1946, Halperin was arrested and accused of espionage in Canada, in connection with the defection of Igor Gouzenko, a Soviet cipher clerk, which occurred in Ottawa in September 1945.Beck (February 2008), p. 14-15. Gouzenko's defection and subsequent investigation showed that the Soviet Union was carrying on large-scale spying in Canada and the United States, including nuclear weapons espionage. After some arduous questioning and confinement lasting several weeks, under a Royal Commission appointed by Justice Minister Louis St-Laurent, followed by a trial in early 1947, Halperin was eventually cleared and freed. He resumed teaching at Queen's, but not until 1948, following more legal hurdles which were raised by Queen's University leadership. Queen's Principal Robert Charles Wallace advocated his return.Beck (February 2008), pp. 14-20, 52. Later career Following von Neumann's death in 1957, Halperin completed two of his unfinished papers, leaving them under von Neumann's name alone.Beck (February 2008), p. 16. Halperin taught at Queen's until 1966, earning tenure as a full professor. He then moved to the University of Toronto until his retirement in 1976, by which time he had authored more than 100 academic papers. In 1980, the Israel Halperin Prize was setup by the Canadian Annual Symposium on Operator Theory and Operator Algebras to be awarded to a member of the Canadian mathematical community who has recently obtained a doctorate and has made contributions to operator theory or operator algebras, in honor of Halperin. Halperin was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws from Queen's in 1989, and was made a Member of the Order of Canada, both for his humanitarian work.Beck (February 2008) pp. 20, 52. Honors Halperin was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1953, and won the Henry Marshall Tory Medal in 1967.Beck (February 2008), p. 52. Personal life Halperin was the father of four children, all of whom went on to become professors: William Halperin, Connie Eaves, Stephen Halperin, and Mary Hannah.http://www.womensresearch.ca/people/faculty/hannah.php Halperin died in 2007 at age 96.

Only Trevor survived. History Allison Family The Allisons, bound for Montreal, booked first-class passage on the Titanic. They boarded the ship in Southampton along with four servants: a maid, Sarah Daniels (no relation to Bess); a nurse, Alice Cleaver; a cook, Amelia Mary Brown (Mildred); and a butler, George Swane. Hudson and Bess occupied cabin C-22, Sarah and Loraine occupied C-24, and Alice and Trevor occupied C-26. Two second-class cabins were also booked for George and Mildred. Hudson and Bess were dining companions with Major Arthur Godfrey Peuchen. At dinner on 14 April, they brought Loraine to the dining room with them so she could see how pretty it was. After the ship struck the iceberg, Hudson left to find out what was going on. While he was gone, Alice took Trevor and went to get the rest of the servants in second class. Hudson returned to find them gone. He delivered Bess and Loraine to Boat 6, and apparently left before it was launched. Major Peuchen recalled how they were almost rescued: Brave Nurse and the Babe She Saved: Alice Cleaver with Trevor Allison (1912) George saw Alice, Mildred, and Trevor safely into Boat 11, which left the ship at around 1:45 am, nearly an hour after Boat 6 had. Sarah had gone up on deck early to investigate the commotion and was hurriedly placed into a boat by a steward who promised to inform the Allisons of her whereabouts. Varying stories claim that Alice panicked and grabbed Trevor, without informing Bess that she was leaving, and that Bess refused to leave the ship without him, though it is possible that the entire group went up on deck together, and that Alice and Trevor were simply lost in the crowd. Hudson, Bess, Loraine, and George were lost in the sinking. Whether or not George found the Allisons and informed them that Trevor was safely off the ship is unknown, but if he did, it is likely the information came too late for any of them to leave the ship. Bess was one of only four first-class women (including Ida Straus and Edith Corse Evans) who perished, while Loraine was the only child of first and second class to do so. Hudson's body was the 135th recovered by the Mackay-Bennett; George's was the 294th. Hudson's body was transported to Chesterville, Ontario to be buried in the family plot in Maple Ridge Cemetery. Alice and Trevor were met in New York City by Hudson's brother, George, who, along with his wife, Lillian, took custody of the now orphaned Trevor. He died on August 7, 1929, at age 18 of food poisoning. He was buried beside Hudson.  Claim by Helen Loraine Kramer to be Loraine Allison In 1940, a woman named Helen Loraine Kramer claimed that she was Loraine Allison and that, at the last minute, her parents gave her up to a man calling himself Hyde (whose identity she said to be that of shipbuilder Thomas Andrews), who raised her on a farm in the American Midwest. Her claim, however, was not accepted by the Allisons. Eventually, she moved away and they never heard from her again. In December 2013, the Loraine Allison Identification Project announced results of mitochondrial DNA testing performed on a sample donated by a female-line descendant of Kramer, and descendants of the Allisons. The test was performed by DNA Diagnostics Center, a facility accredited by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors. The results were negative, demonstrating that no relationship existed between Kramer and the Allisons. The Allisons in film The 1912 German silent film about the disaster, In Nacht und Eis (English: \\"In Night and Ice\\"), includes the Allison family story, but not by name. The Allisons were major characters in the 1996 miniseries Titanic. The subplot regarding them was highly fictionalized and filled with historical inaccuracies: for example, it added the story of the long-standing myth that Alice (portrayed by Felicity Waterman) was a child murderess who stole Trevor in a fit of panic, thus forcing the rest of the family to remain on the ship looking for him until it was too late. Their other servants (Sarah, Mildred, and George) were not featured in it ‚Äì the only one travelling with them was Alice.https://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org/community/threads/1996-titanic- miniseries-list-of- inaccuracies.13161/https://duckduckgo.com/?q=dr.+paul+lee+titanic+1996+miniseries+site%3Awww.paullee.com&ia;=web The Allisons are also featured in the 2012 miniseries Titanic.

He also was an influential politician: a member of the city council, the States- Provincial in Haarlem and the Senate in The Hague. In his later years he became an important art and plant collector. On his death he left 250 paintings to the city of Amsterdam, who could barely pay the inheritance tax.Knoef, J. (1949) De verzamelaar A. van der Hoop. In: Jaarboek Amstelodamum 42, p. 51 - 71. In this way Van der Hoop contributed substantially to the collection of the Rijksmuseum. Life Adriaan van der Hoop was the son of Joan Cornelis van der Hoop, secretary of the Soci√´teit van Suriname, prosecutor for the Admiralty of Amsterdam and Minister of the Navy. Adriaan studied law in Groningen and Kiel, when it was still a Danish city. (N.B. Holland was occupied by the French army between 1795 - 1813). With his Danish passport he traveled through Germany and England. In 1811, he was hired by the firm Hope & Co., for years an important lender to the Russian state. Back in Holland in 1814 Adriaan van der Hoop was involved in the setting up of the Constitution and accompanied emperor Alexander I of Russia on his visit to Holland. In 1815, he was appointed by Alexander Baring to lead the firm Hope & Co. A debt of 100,000 guilder owed by his brother-in-law Jan Clifford led in 1819 to a drawn-out court case between the two men. The day after the verdict, four years later, Clifford committed suicide with a pistol. Adriaan raised rare plants on his country estate Spaarnberg, near Santpoort. There he grew 120 kinds of South African Erica; he had two blossoming agaves and ten kinds of orchids.Gnirrep, K. (2004) De Schat van Spaarnberg. In: Maandblad Amstelodamum, p. 3-21. The country house was designed by Jan David Zocher, who on van der Hoop's request also designed a new stock exchange in Amsterdam. Adriaan owned racehorses and in 1832 he started to collect art objects on a large scale. Adriaan bought works by contemporary painters, including Jan Adam Kruseman, Johannes Christianus Schotel and Barend Cornelis Koekkoek. His collection of paintings - which he had partly inherited, included items by Vermeer, Ruisdael, Rembrandt, Jan Steen and Adriaen van der Werff, and could be visited by appointment at his house on Keizersgracht 444. He had bought this house in 1822. The building on the Keizersgracht had been the offices of his employer Hope & Co., and had previously been inhabited by Hope & Co. family members Thomas Hope, his brother Adrian Hope, his cousin Henry Hope (who moved next door to 448), and later Thomas' son Jan Hope. Mus√©e Van der Hoop After his death, the Van der Hoop Museum was opened in his former home on the Keizersgracht and various catalogs were produced 1858-1872 in Dutch and French.Mus√©e Van der Hoop Description des Tableaux In 1885 the collection was merged with the newly built Rijksmuseum.

Until 1990 he was married to Joan Root, who was a Kenyan-born conservationist, murdered at Lake Naivasha in 2006. Before that tragedy, the couple did National Geographic articles together from 1963-71 on animals, Galapagos Islands, and mainly African wildlife. Notable films include: The Year of the Wildebeest (1974), Safari by Balloon (1975), Mysterious Castles of Clay (1978), Two in the Bush (1980) and A Season in the Sun (1983). Alan Root's strong narrative style characterised much of Survival‚Äôs output and helped shape a sophisticated genre known as Blue Chip films. The Year of the Wildebeest was the epic story of the thundering migration of wildebeest herds across the plains of the Serengeti. Mysterious Castles of Clay, by contrast, showed wildlife in intricate detail in and around termite mounds, revealing the insects' highly organised society and skills of construction. It received a nomination for an Academy Award. The Roots used a hot-air balloon to film sequences for the wildebeest film, and in Safari by Balloon made the first hot-air balloon flight over Mount Kilimanjaro. Two in the Bush (re-titled Lights, Action, Africa! in the USA) included \\"Mysterious Castles Clay\\" footage of a spitting cobra directing its venom at Joan's face positioned just a few feet from the snake while Alan filmed. A Season in the Sun, an account of wildlife's struggle to survive the heat and drought of the dry season, won an Emmy and a Peabody Award after it was aired by PBS in 1987. Alan and Joan Root were responsible for many of Survival's most successful films for almost 20 years from the mid-1960s. After their partnership ended, Alan Root continued his association with Survival as a cinematographer, producing his own films and guiding the early African work of camera team Mark Deeble and Victoria Stone, while latterly also acting as adviser to the series. Death In March 2017, Root was diagnosed with glioblastoma. He died on 26 August 2017, aged 80, in Nanyuki, Kenya, following a vacation with his wife, Fran Michelmore, and two sons to Alaska.

The mines of Paris (in French carri√®res de Paris ‚Äî \\"quarries of Paris\\") comprise a number of abandoned, subterranean mines under Paris, France, connected together by galleries. Three main networks exist; the largest, known as the grand r√©seau sud (\\"large south network\\"), lies under the 5th, 6th, 14th and 15th arrondissements, a second under the 13th arrondissement, and a third under the 16th, though other minor networks are found under the 12th, 14th and 16th for instance. The commercial product was Lutetian limestone for use as a building material, as well as gypsum for use in \\"plaster of Paris\\". Exploring the mines is prohibited by the prefecture and penalised with large fines. Despite restrictions, Paris' former mines are frequently toured by urban explorers known popularly as cataphiles. A limited part of the network has been used as an underground ossuary, known as the catacombs of Paris, some of which can be toured legally. (The catacombs were temporarily closed between September and 19 December 2009 due to vandalism, after which they could be legally visited again from the entrance on Place Denfert-Rochereau). The entire subterranean network is commonly but mistakenly referred to as \\"the catacombs\\". Formation of the minerals mined in Paris French cross-section diagram of Parisian Left Bank rock layers; minerals useful for construction are coded yellow. Paris lies within the Paris Basin, a geological bowl-like shape created by millennia of sea immersion and erosion. Much of north-western France spent much of its geological history as a submerged sea water coastline, but towards our era, and the formation of our continents as we know them, the then relatively flat area that would become the Paris region became increasingly elevated. The region was alternately invaded and sculpted by both sea water, inland sea water lagoons and fresh water, in addition to above-water air and river erosion. These cycles produced a rich and varied geological strata containing many minerals that would become a source of growth and wealth for the Paris region. Mineral formation The region of Paris has spent most of its geologic history under water, which is why it has such varied and important accumulations of sedimentary minerals, notably Lutetian Limestone. The Paris area was a relatively flat sea-bottom during the early Cretaceous period: first in a deep-sea environment, then under a more agitated near-shoreline sea towards the end of the same period, Paris' largely silica-based sedimentary deposits became, under the action of pressure and the carbonic acid content of seawater, a thick deposit of clay. The invasion of calcium-rich seas then covered this with an even more important layer of chalk. Paris emerged from the sea towards the end of the Cretaceous Period, and later Palaeozoic-era continental shifts, particularly the Variscan orogeny geological upheavals, created a series of hills and valleys throughout the Parisian basin, creating conditions ideal for the mineral deposits that would appear during the next eras. After a long period above sea level that ended towards the Cenozoic era, Paris began a period of alternation between sea and land environments. Paris was the middle of a shoreline of bays and lagoons of still seawater, an environment perfect for the silica-based sea life abundant then. As sea creatures died and settled to the lagoon bottom, their shells mixed with the deposits already present; pressure from additional sea-life sedimentation and the chemical action of the water transformed the result into a sedimentary stone quite particular to the Paris area, calcaire grossier (calcaire lut√©cien in more modern publications). Paris' most important deposits of this stone occurred during the Eocene epoch's Lutetian age; in fact, the age itself is named for the sedimentary activity in the Paris region, as Lutetia was the city's name during Roman times. Paris' next important mineral deposit came with the Bartonian age. After a period of land-sea alternation that brought layers of sand and low- quality calcaire grossier, the sea regressed again to return only occasionally to refill lagoons with seawater. The result was stagnating pools of evaporating seawater; the salts of these, mixed with other organic matter and mineral deposits, crystallised into the calcium sulphate composition that is gypsum. This evaporation cycle occurred several times during this age, creating several layers of gypsum divided by layers of mineral left by the sea's brief return. In all, Parisian gypsum deposits are divided into four \\"masses\\", with the last appearing, the haute masse, being the most important and most exploited in Parisian history. Gypsum, an evaporite mineral, is known for its fragility against freshwater invasion, re-dissolving quite readily. The sea returned one last time to the Parisian basin towards the end of the Paleogene period, leaving several layers of varied sediment capped with a thick layer of clay. This last deposit was important when the Paris basin rose from the sea, this time definitively, during the early Neogene, as the topmost layer would protect the soluble gypsum layers from erosion by air and weathering. Erosion Paris began to take the form we know at present as huge rivers resulting from the melting of successive ice ages cut through millions of years of sediment, leaving only formations too elevated or too resistant to erosion. Paris' hills of Montmartre and Belleville are the only places where gypsum remained, as the ancestor of the river Seine once flowed, almost along its present path, as wide as half the city, with many arms and tributaries. Mining techniques=Open-air quarries The most primitive mining technique was to extract a mineral where it could be seen on the surface, in places where millennia of erosion by the ancestors of the Paris basin's rivers Seine, Marne and Bi√®vre exposed many levels of Paris' underlying stratification to open air. Minerals available from the surface, beginning with Paris' highest elevations in the valleys created by this erosion are: the plaster deposits in the upper reaches of the Right Bank hills of Montmartre and Belleville; lower in the valleys are sand and limestone deposits nearest the surface on Paris' Left Bank. The underlying clay strata were accessible from the surface in the lowest points of the Seine, Marne and Bi√®vre river valleys. Underground mining Open-air quarrying became quite difficult and even costly when the desired minerals lay below the surface, as sometimes enormous amounts of earth and other unwanted deposits would have to be removed before it could be extracted. One means of avoiding this problem was to dig horizontally into a hillside along the mineral strata from where it was visible in its flank, but the Paris area had few mineral deposits, save gypsum, the disposition of which fulfilled these conditions. There were few open-air stone quarries by the 15th century; instead, miners would access the targeted stone deposit through vertical wells, and dig into it horizontally from there. Although it seems that well-mining method only began then, there is evidence that Romans used this technique to mine clay under Paris' Left Bank Montagne Sainte-Genevi√®ve hill. =Piliers tourn√©s= No matter the means they used to access the underground mineral, miners had to provide a means of maintaining the enormous weight of the ceiling over their horizontally-burrowed excavations. The earliest means to this end, in a technique called piliers tourn√©s, became common from the late 10th century. A tunnel would be dug horizontally along the deposit, tunnels perpendicular to the first were opened along the way, and tunnels parallel to the initial tunnel would be opened through these. The result was a grid of columns of untouched mineral deposit, or piliers tourn√©s, that prevented a mine's collapse. In areas where a mineral was removed in a wider swath than the rest of the mine, usually towards the edge of the exploitation, miners would complement the natural mineral columns with piliers √† bras, or stacks of stone creating a supporting column between floor and ceiling. Gypsum mines, the origin of the famous plaster of Paris, used this technique with an added third dimension: as some of northern Paris' gypsum deposits measured thick in some places, miners would create their tunnel grids in the top of the deposit, then begin extracting downwards. A gypsum mine in a particularly thick deposit had almost a cathedral-like air upon depletion, because of the towering columns and arches of mineral remaining. Only one example of this sort of gypsum- mining remains in Paris, in a renovated \\"grotto\\" under the Buttes-Chaumont gardens. This method of burrowing was effective for the short-term, but over time the relatively soft mineral, subject to the elements and the earth's shifting, could erode or fissure, endangering the solidity of the mine. =Hagues et bourrages= Another technique appearing towards the early 18th century, hagues et bourrages, was both more economically and structurally sound. Instead of tunnelling into the exploitable mineral, miners would begin at a central point and extract stone progressively outwards; when they had mined to a point that left a wide area of the ceiling unsupported, they would erect a line of piliers √† bras, continue their extraction beyond that line, then return to build a second parallel line of stone columns. The space along both lines of columns was then transformed into walls with stone blocks, or hagues, and the space between filled with packed rubble and other mineral detritus (or bourrage). This technique allowed much more of the targeted mineral to be extracted, and provided a support that could both settle and shift with the mine ceiling it supported. Paris' Growth over abandoned mine sites There is no concrete proof of any mining activity before the late 13th century. The earliest known text is a brief mention in the town commerce register: Paris had 18 \\"quarriers\\" during 1292. The first written act concerning any mine dates from almost a century later, 1373, in an authorisation that a certain Dame Perrenelle be permitted to operate the plaster mine already existing in her property to the lower flank of Montmartre. The majority of Paris' limestone deposits were in its Left Bank, and at the time of the city populace's 10th-century move to the Right Bank, were well in the suburbs of the former Roman/Merovingian city. As the stone from abandoned ruins became depleted during the 13th century, new mines began to open further from the city centre. Earlier mines closer to the city centre, when discovered, sometimes served a new purpose; when Louis XI donated the former Chateau Vauvert, a property which now forms the northern part of the Luxembourg Garden, to the Chartreuse order during 1259. The monks renovated the caverns under this property into wine cellars, and continued the exploitation of stone to the ancient mine's extremities. By the early 16th century, there were stone excavations operating around the present Jardin des Plantes, Boulevard St-Marcel, Val-de-Gr√¢ce hospital, southern Luxembourg (by then the Chartreuse Coventry) and in areas around the rue Vaugirard. Paris' then suburban plaster mines remained for the most part in the Right Bank Montmartre and Belleville hills. It was only with its expansion past its 13th- century walls (following almost exactly today's metro lines 6 and 2) that the city began to build on previously-mined land, which eventually resulted in many cave-ins and other disasters. The Left Bank faubourgs or suburbs were the most at risk: during the 15th century, the largest demographic expansions over mined land were the faubourg Saint-Victor (from the eastern extremity of the rue des √âcoles and south down the rue Geoffroy St Hilaire); the faubourg St Marcel (rue Descartes, rue Mouffetard); the faubourg Saint-Jacques (along the present rue Saint-Jacques below the rue Soufflot), and the faubourg (then bourg) Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s to the south of the still-standing church of the same name. Although the 17th-century Right Bank city of Paris had during five centuries expanded past three successive arcs of fortifications, Left Bank Paris was nowhere near as dense in comparison within its unchanged but crumbling 13th-century city walls. Many royal and ecclesiastical institutions came to the area during this period, but it seems that the mined state of the Paris faubourg underground had been forgotten by then. The Val de Gr√¢ce coventry and the Observatoire observatory, built from 1645 and 1672 respectively, were found to be undermined by immense caverns left by long- abandoned stone mines; reinforcing which consumed most of the budget reserved for both projects. Growth of the faubourgs continued along the main routes from the city, but began to expand at a faster rate with the increase of traffic along the routes to the palaces of Fontainebleau and Versailles. The route de Fontainebleau (extending to the south of the present Place Denfert- Rochereau), then called Rue d'Enfer and now named Avenue Denfert-Rochereau, would be the site of one of Paris' first major mine collapses during December 1774, when about 30 metres (100 feet) of the street collapsed to a depth of about thirty metres (a hundred feet). Abandoned mine consolidation The 1774 disaster was partly responsible for the Conseil du Roi's decision to create a special division of architects responsible for the inspection, maintenance, and repair of the ground under royal buildings within and around Paris. Another division of inspectors created about the same time, but directed by the Ministry of Finance, claimed the role of assuring the safety of the national roadways that were their jurisdiction. Created officially on 24 April 1777, the Inspection G√©n√©rale des Carri√®res (IGC) entered service on the same eve after a new collapse of the route de Fontainebleau (Avenue Denfert-Rochereau) outside of the barri√®re d'Enfer city gateway. Although the Ministry of Finance continued to claim jurisdiction of damaged roadways, this rather inept service was eventually succeeded by the Crown-appointed IGC. As the centuries of mining under Paris' underground were mostly uncharted and thus largely forgotten, the real extent of former mines was unknown then. All important buildings and roadways were inspected, any signs of shifting were noted, and the ground underneath was sounded for cavities. Roadways were particularly problematic; instead of sounding the ground around the route, inspectors instead tunneled directly under the length of endangered roadway, filling any cavities they found along the way, and reinforcing the walls of their tunnels with solid masonry to eliminate the possibility of any future excavations and disasters. When a length of roadway was consolidated, the date of the work was engraved in the tunnel wall under it, next to the name of the roadway above; Paris' tunnel renovations, dating to as early as 1777, are now still a testimony to Paris' old street names and roadways.  Re-use of abandoned mines as a municipal ossuary  Bones from the former Cimeti√®re de la Madeleine During the 18th century, the growing population of Paris resulted in the filling of existing cemeteries, causing public health concerns. Towards the end of the 18th century, it was decided to create three new large cemeteries and to relocate the existing cemeteries within the city limits. Human remains were progressively moved to a renovated section of the abandoned mines that would eventually become a full-fledged ossuary whose entrance is located on present day Place Denfert-Rochereau. The ossuary became a tourist attraction on a small scale from the early 19th century, and has been open to the public on a regular basis from 1867. Although it is officially named the Ossuaire Municipal, it is known popularly as \\"the catacombs\\". Though the entire subterranean network of Paris' mines is not a burial place as such, the term \\"Catacombs of Paris\\" is also used commonly to refer to the whole.

Biographic data  General Gabriel Par√≠s was born in Ibagu√©, Tolima, on March 8, 1910.Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n, Page 227, Bogot√°, Colombia, 1983  Early years  Gabriel Par√≠s studied at the Colegio San Sim√≥n in Ibagu√©, Department of Tolima. After graduating Par√≠s enlisted in the Colombian Army studying at the Gr. Jos√© Mar√≠a C√≥rdova Academy in 1928 and becoming a lieutenant for the cavalry later on December 11, 1929 assigned to Grupo No. 1 P√°ez, unit in which he spent most of his career.  War with Peru  As a lieutenant, Par√≠s participated in the Colombia-Peru War in 1933 at the l√≠nea Baraya-La Tagua war front. For being an excellent officer Par√≠s was assigned a horse trainer at the ‚ÄòGr. Jos√© Mar√≠a C√≥rdova' Academy.  Promotions as officer  Gabriel Par√≠s was promoted to Major in 1941 at the Colombia Superior School of War. In 1941 was later promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and was sent to study in Fort Leavenworth, United States. He was later assigned trainer at the Colombian Superior School of War and Chief of the Mounted and Veterinary. In 1949 was assigned commander of the Grupo N¬∞ 2 Rond√≥n unit and in 1950, Chief of the Second Brigade, based in Barranquilla. He was later assigned commander of the Fourth Brigade, based in Medell√≠n.  Under Rojas Pinillas rule  During the government of President Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, Par√≠s was appointed to many public office posts.  General of the Army  Par√≠s was promoted to Brigadier General on February 28, 1953 and assigned commander of the Colombian Army. On June 27 of this same year Par√≠s was appointed alternative representative of Colombia in the disarmament commission of the UN Security Council acting as ambassador of Colombia to the United Nations.  Ministries  Par√≠s was appointed Minister of Justice on February 9, 1954 and later on August 7 appointed as Minister of War. He also managed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs temporarily. Par√≠s occupied the presidency of Colombia temporarily while General Rojas Pinilla visited Ecuador between July 30 and August 2 in 1955. On February 29, 1956 Par√≠s was promoted to the rank of Major General.  Military Junta  Civil unrest and, political upheaval and public discontent had turned the country into chaos. Angry and violent street demonstrations and a general strike on May 10, 1957, brought down the government of General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla. At the age of 47 years, General Par√≠s was selected by General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla to precede the Military Junta set to replace himself. General Par√≠s assumed the Presidency on May 10, 1957, along with two other Generals of the Army, Luis E. Ord√≥√±ez Castillo and Rafael Navas Pardo, a General from the National Police Deogracias Fonseca Espinosa and rear Admiral of the Colombian National Armada Rub√©n Piedrah√≠ta Arango. General Par√≠s was elected as Chairman of the Junta, and as such, became ‚ÄúPresidente de la Rep√∫blica‚Äù. The other four members of the Junta received the same title. The first decrees of the Junta were to restore peace and order, freedom of speech and association, freedom of the press, adherence to the Constitution and calling for a presidential election as soon as possible. In order to ease tensions, the Junta also appointed as Ministers of the presidential cabinet highly reputed members of both political parties.Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n, Page 228, Bogot√°, Colombia, 1983 Besides restoring peace and order, the Junta‚Äôs main concern was the economy. The nation had a huge fiscal deficit, the trade deficit was exorbitant and the national debt had surpassed the $500 million dollars. This situation had caused a very high unemployment and triggered a recession, which was turning into a depression. In order to address this urgent matter, the Junta created an economic and financial task force, preside by Alfonso L√≥pez Pumarejo and Mariano Ospina P√©rez. Both leaders were commissioned and set to the United States of America as a national mission to secure an emergency loan of $103 million dollars to stimulate the economy, pay some foreign debt and invigorate the employment scenario. This mission was also to discuss and negotiate a price agreement for coffee, as the export of this commodity was essential to the trade balance of Colombia. The commission also promoted the advancement of technical educational and created the \\"Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje\\" (SENA). Regarding international trade and commerce, the administration of General Par√≠s and the Junta, implemented the \\"Plan Vallejo\\" which was designed to promote and stimulate exports and to reduce unnecessary imports. The Junta also encouraged foreign private investment and eased monetary operations and exchange rates. General Par√≠s and the Junta initiated international negotiations with major world producing countries to establish what would be known as the ‚ÄúPacto Mundial‚Äù (world accord). In the political front, in order to honor the agreements of the \\"Treaty of Sitges‚Äù, the Junta would call a general election. The treaty, signed by former presidents Laureano G√≥mez and Alberto Lleras Camargo in June, 1957, prescribed for the Junta to hold a general election on December 1, of that same year, as a national plebiscite to legitimize the National Front.  End of Military Junta  On May 4, 1958 popular elections took place to replace the Military Junta and transition once again into a democracy. Alberto Lleras resulted elected as the first president of the National Front. General Par√≠s retired from active service and inaugurated Lleras as president of Colombia on August 7, 1958. Par√≠s Gordillo dedicated to his private life affairs.  Recognitions  In 1996 Par√≠s was decorated by the Municipal Council of Bogot√° in the 150th anniversary of the installation of the Sim√≥n Bol√≠var statue at the Plaza Mayor. The statue was donated by Par√≠s's great grandfather don Jos√© Ignacio Par√≠s Ricaurte. In 2000 was honorary promoted to three suns general by then president of Colombia, Andr√©s Pastrana. In 2002 Par√≠s attended the inauguration of √Ålvaro Uribe as president of Colombia.  Personal life  On 28 September 1936, Gabriel Par√≠s married Mar√≠a Felisa Quevedo Par√≠s (his cousin) (11 May 1911 ‚Äì 17 June 1994), and had four children: Gabriel, Jaime, Gloria and Ligia Carolina Par√≠s Quevedo. He lived his last days at a ranch named ‚ÄòEl Recreo' in a vereda named El Topacio in Flandes.

The earliest dates from 1864, and is a Primitive Methodist chapel on Crewe Road (now the B5071). A Wesleyan Methodist chapel was constructed on Audlem Road (now the A529) in 1900; it closed in 1968. During the First World War, eighty German prisoners- of-war were interned in Hatherton and employed as agricultural labourers, and the stables of The Broomlands near Birchall Moss served as an equine hospital. The stables were later converted into dwellings and a village store and post office, which has since closed. In 1881, more than two-thirds of the men in the parish were engaged in agriculture. Hatherton was within the Delves- Broughton estate until it was broken up in around 1920. In the 1960s, the Co- operative Wholesale Society bought many local farms and ran them as Co-op farms. The 1967‚Äì68 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease caused major problems for dairy farms in the Wybunbury area, including Joseph Heler's in Hatherton. The parish remained largely rural in 1990, with only minimal development noted since the 1960s. Governance Pasture on the South Cheshire Way in the south east of the parish Hatherton is administered jointly with the adjacent parish of Walgherton by Hatherton and Walgherton Parish Council. From 1974 the civil parish was served by Crewe and Nantwich Borough Council, which was succeeded on 1 April 2009 by the unitary authority of Cheshire East. Hatherton falls in the parliamentary constituency of Crewe and Nantwich, which has been represented by Kieran Mullan since 2019, after being represented by Laura Smith (2017‚Äì19), Edward Timpson (2008‚Äì17) and Gwyneth Dunwoody (1983‚Äì2008). Geography, ecology and transport The civil parish has an area of . The A529 runs north‚Äìsouth through the parish and the B5071 (Crewe Road) runs to the north-east from the A529 junction at Oakes Corner towards Walgherton. Park Lane connects the A529 and the B5071, and Hunsterson Road runs eastwards from this junction on the B5071 to the hamlet of Hunsterson in the adjacent parish. Lodge Lane runs south-east from the B5071 to Hunsterson Road. Bridgemere Lane runs eastwards from the A529 to Hunsterson, and Birchall Moss Lane cuts from the A529 to Bridgemere Lane. The hamlet of Hatherton is centred at the crossroads of Park Lane/Hunsterson Road with the B5071, extending along both unclassified roads. The South Cheshire Way long-distance footpath runs through the south of the parish, partly following Bridgemere Lane and the A529. Marsh helleborine, an orchid found at Hatherton Flush that is rare in Cheshire The River Weaver runs north‚Äìsouth forming the western boundary of the parish, Artle Brook runs on or near the northern boundary, and Birchall Brook forms part of the south-western boundary. The terrain is undulating, sloping more steeply down to the Weaver in the west, with a lowest elevation of around along the Weaver. The highest area is in the south of the parish, around Birchall Moss and south of Bridgemere Lane, at around . The entire civil parish is classified by Cheshire Wildlife Trust as \\"Lower Farms and Woods\\", and the area in the south of the parish around Birchall Moss has been identified as a key area for wildlife.Cheshire Wildlife Trust, pp. 6, 10 There are numerous small meres or ponds, as well as small areas of deciduous and mixed woodland, including Birchall Moss, Birchenhill Wood, Acton's Rough, Lane Wood, Gorse Wood, Chestnut Wood and Blackthorn Wood. Chestnut and Blackthorn Woods, which line Birchall Brook on the boundary with Hankelow, are marked on tithe maps and might represent small patches of ancient woodland.Cheshire Wildlife Trust, p. 22 Hatherton Flush is a Site of Special Scientific Interest on the bank of the Weaver south of Acton's Rough (at ), designated for its variety of wetland plants. It is the largest example of its kind of flush in the county.Cheshire Wildlife Trust, pp. 7, 22 The flush is set in partly unimproved acidic grassland. The site supports abundant orchids, including the locally rare species marsh helleborine, as well as seven species of sedge; other locally rare species include marsh lousewort and tubular water dropwort, and the locally scarce species bog pimpernel, marsh valerian and spiny restharrow are also found at the site. Demography Horse paddocks by the B5071 According to the 2001 census, Hatherton civil parish had a population of 344, increasing to 360 in 143 households at the 2011 census. This represents a small decline from the mid-19th-century peak, but an increase compared with the mid-20th-century population; historical population figures are 191 (1801), 394 (1851), 367 (1871), 290 (1901) and 321 (1951). Landmarks A small mid-19th-century Methodist chapel is located on Crewe Road; as of 2020, it forms part of the Methodist ministry of nearby Hankelow. Several listed buildings are located within the parish, one of which is designated as grade II*, the middle of the three grades, denoting \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\": Hatherton Manor, off Audlem Road (A529), is a farmhouse of five bays in orange-red brick with stone dressings, dating from 1703. There are two storeys, plus a basement and attics, under a tiled roof, and the main entrance is approached by a flight of stone steps. Of the buildings listed at grade II, the oldest is Yew Tree Farmhouse on Audlem Road, a 16th-century, timber-framed house with a tiled roof, featuring small framing infilled with brick.

History Early 20th century photograph of teachers at the Etz Chaim Yeshiva located in the Hurva Synagogue complex. The building on Jaffa Road, 2010. Etz Chaim Yeshiva was originally a Talmud Torah that was established in 1841 by the Chief Rabbi of Jerusalem, Shmuel Salant. For the first two years classes were held in various rooms throughout the Old City. In 1857, the yeshiva consolidated into a group of buildings adjacent to the Hurva Synagogue, sharing the premises with the Beth Din of Jerusalem. It was at this stage that the institution was renamed \\"Etz Chaim Yeshiva.\\" The first permanent home of the yeshiva was financed by Rabbi Tzvi Zeev Fiszbejn (Fishbein in English), a wealthy brush maker originally from Miedzyrzec Podlaski in what is today Poland, who donated a thousand rubles in silver to Rabbi Salant for that purpose in 1863.url=http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/Miedzyrzec_Podlaski/mie077.html#Page79 Moshe Nechemiah Kahanov led the school from 1867 to his death in 1886 and was as concerned with the progress of his average students as with the gifted.Rossoff, Dovid. (2004). Where heaven touches earth:Jewish life in Jerusalem from Medieval times to the present. Jerusalem: Guardian Press. Revised Edition. pp. 233-235. . The head teacher was Rabbi Chaim Mann. His brother Yehuda Leib Mann was the secretary who also served as a teacher. They were the sons of Rabbi Yaakov Mann, who was a prominent scholar who had declined the invitation of Rabbi Tzvi Pesach Frank to become a dayan on the Beth Din. (He went on to build the Sha'arey Tzedek Medical Center and the Lemel school). As the yeshiva expanded, a plot of land on Jaffa Road was acquired in 1908, and subsequently a kollel was established, catering mainly to the alumni of the yeshiva. At the time, Rabbi Yechiel Michel Tucazinsky, who was married to the granddaughter of Rabbi Salant, served as the rosh yeshiva. After disputes arose between the pupils and the faculty, a permanent agreement was reached by Rabbi Tzvi Pesach Frank, who reallocated the positions of authority. In 1925, Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer was appointed to lead the yeshiva and Rabbi Aryeh Levin was made the mashgiach. After the death of Rabbi Meltzer, his son-in-law, Rabbi Aharon Kotler, was appointed rosh yeshiva. In an unusual arrangement, he held this position while continuing to live in the United States, and visited Jerusalem on occasion. During the periods when he resided in Israel, he delivered fortnightly lectures. After his death, Rabbi Elazar Shach was chosen to head the yeshiva, and he also delivered fortnightly lectures. Some time later, Rabbi Yisroel Yaakov Fisher took up a position at the yeshiva. A grandson of Rabbi Aharon Kotler, Rabbi Zvulun Schwartzman, has served as one of the primary leaders. A great-grandson of Rabbi Salant, Rabbi Nissan Tikochinsky, the son of Rabbi Yechiel Michel Tucazinsky, served as head and director of the institution until his death in 2012. For many years he traveled to the United States and South Africa to raise money to keep the institution functioning. Threat of demolition Although the yeshiva building on Jaffa Road is registered on Jerusalem's List of Protected Monuments, in 2007 the building was under the threat of demolition to make way for shops and offices. The authorities accepted an appeal for the buildings' preservation.

He spent two seasons at Swindon and at this time he was also 'doubling up' with the club that owns his contract, the Wolverhampton Wolves. This was quite a successful time for Neath. He won the Elite League title with Wolves in 2002 and the Premier League Four Team Championship with the Robins in 2003. However he never really settled at Swindon and he moved to the Rye House Rockets in 2004. Neath was an instant success for the Rockets, topping the clubs averages and finishing third in the fiercely competitive Champions Chase meeting at King's Lynn. The following season, Chris again topped the Rockets averages as the team completed and League and Premier Trophy double, becoming the most successful team in the club's history. 2006 was an injury plagued season for the Rockets, however they still managed to make the League Play offs, eventually losing out to eventual champions, King's Lynn. In 2007 Neath was captain of the side that won the Premier League title - the club's second in two years. In 2008 having been a ten-year asset of the Wolverhampton Wolves Neath was awarded a testimonial meeting held at the Rye House Speedway, where he finished in third place behind Speedway Grand Prix rider Fredrik Lindgren and British Under-21 Champion Tai Woffinden.

Origins of the club  Two older clubs in Turin existed before this one, they were mixed sports clubs who competed in football as well as other sports. They were formed respectively in 1887 and 1889, and were called Torino Football and Cricket Club and Nobili Torino. The former was founded by Edoardo Bosio, a merchant worker in the British textile industry, who had brought the game back to Turin after experiencing it in England; this was most likely the first ever Italian club to participate in organised football. Their original colours were red and black stripes. The second club, whose name meant \\"Turin Nobles\\", bore the name of noble because it contained the Duke of the Abruzzi and Alfonso Ferrero di Ventimiglia (who would later become a president of FIGC). The colours of Nobili Torino were amber and black stripes. The two clubs merged in 1891 to form Internazionale Torino, taking on the colours of Nobili.  Italian Football Championship  Along with Genoa and two other Torinese clubs which had sprung up since Internazionale's founding, FBC Torinese and Ginnastica Torino; Internazionale Torino competed in the first ever Italian Football Championship in 1898. The competition was staged at Velodromo Umberto I in Turin, they took part in the first ever Italian Championship game when they beat FBC Torinese 1‚Äì0. In the final against Genoa, the match ended 1‚Äì1 and as thus went into extra time, Genoa scored two more and ended the game 3‚Äì1 meaning Internazionale Torino were runners-up. The club returned for a second season, beating Ginnastica Torino 2‚Äì0 at the Campo Piazza d‚ÄôArmi in Turin, to once again qualify for the final against rivals Genoa. The game against Genoa ended in a 3‚Äì1 defeat at Ponte Carrega in Genoa with Albert Weber scoring for Internazionale. From two seasons in the league, the club ended as runners-up in both. During 1900 the club merged with Football Club Torinese, and the resulting club kept the Torinese name.

The technology for VCDHD was invented with in: Japan, the Netherlands and Poland. Since the name of the technology is similar to the arbitrarily inferior VCD, it's also marketed using the name DVHD (Disc Versatile High Density). The capacity of a VCDHD is 4.7 GB, the same as an average single-layer DVD. According to the official site, the tests at Philips laboratories have proven the discs to be fully compatible with modern DVD players. With use of blue laser technology steadily becoming available now, the capacity may be increased by up to 15 GB. The format's main advantages include: * a better resistance to scratching in comparison to DVDs * a thickness of 0.6 mm (compared to 1.2 mm of a DVD) * extreme elasticity and the resulting resistance to bending * low manufacturing and production costs and time (approximately 2 seconds for a VCDHD, compared to a DVD which is approximately three times that amount) * production defect levels are only about 1% * the format does not require a DVD license to manufacture * It works correctly on most DVD drives Most popular in: Russia, Ukraine and Poland.

DDAs are used for rasterization of lines, triangles and polygons. They can be extended to non linear functions, such as perspective correct texture mapping, quadratic curves, and traversing voxels. In its simplest implementation for linear cases such as lines, the DDA algorithm interpolates values in interval by computing for each xi the equations xi = xi‚àí1 \\\\+ 1, yi = yi‚àí1 \\\\+ m, where m is the slope of the line. This slope can be expressed in DDA as follows: :m = \\\\frac{y_{\\\\rm end} -y_{\\\\rm start}}{x_{\\\\rm end}-x_{\\\\rm start}} In fact any two consecutive points (x,y) lying on this line segment should satisfy the equation.  Performance  The DDA method can be implemented using floating-point or integer arithmetic. The native floating-point implementation requires one addition and one rounding operation per interpolated value (e.g. coordinate x, y, depth, color component etc.) and output result. This process is only efficient when an FPU with fast add and rounding operation will be available. The fixed-point integer operation requires two additions per output cycle, and in case of fractional part overflow, one additional increment and subtraction. The probability of fractional part overflows is proportional to the ratio m of the interpolated start/end values. DDAs are well suited for hardware implementation and can be pipelined for maximized throughput.  Algorithm  A linear DDA starts by calculating the smaller of dy or dx for a unit increment of the other. A line is then sampled at unit intervals in one coordinate and corresponding integer values nearest the line path are determined for the other coordinate. Considering a line with positive slope, if the slope is less than or equal to 1, we sample at unit x intervals (dx=1) and compute successive y values as : y_{k+1} = y_k + m : x_{k+1} = x_k + 1 Subscript k takes integer values starting from 0, for the 1st point and increases by 1 until endpoint is reached. y value is rounded off to nearest integer to correspond to a screen pixel. For lines with slope greater than 1, we reverse the role of x and y i.e. we sample at dy=1 and calculate consecutive x values as : x_{k+1} = x_k + \\\\frac{1}{m} : y_{k+1} = y_k + 1 Similar calculations are carried out to determine pixel positions along a line with negative slope. Thus, if the absolute value of the slope is less than 1, we set dx=1 if x_{\\\\rm start} i.e. the starting extreme point is at the left.
