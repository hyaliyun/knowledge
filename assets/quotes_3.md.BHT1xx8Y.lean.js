Its local government area is the City of Whitehorse. At the 2016 census, Box Hill had a population of 11,395. Founded as a township in the 1850s, Box Hill grew over the following century into a small city with its own CBD, its own municipality in the former City of Box Hill, and its own suburbs, including Box Hill North and Box Hill South. In the 1950s, Box Hill was absorbed into Melbourne as part of the eastward expansion of the metropolis. Today, Box Hill is notable for its large Chinese community, and is home to the city's tallest high-rise buildings outside the CBD. As a result, the suburb has become known as \\"Melbourne's second city\\". A major transportation hub for Melbourne's eastern suburbs, Box Hill is home to one of the city's busiest train stations, located beneath Box Hill Central. It is also served by the route 109 tram and numerous bus routes.  History = Early settlement  Frederick McCubbin's Down on His Luck, painted in Box Hill in 1889. He and other Australian impressionists founded the Box Hill artists' camp. Box Hill was first settled by the squatter Arundel Wrighte, formerly of Van Diemen's Land, who, in 1838 took up a pastoral lease on the land he had previously explored in the Bushy Creek area. The first permanent settlers, Thomas Toogood and his wife Edith, purchased in 1841 and Wrighte built a house on his property, \\"Marionvale\\", in 1844. The Pioneers' Memorial, which can be found in front of the town hall, is made from a chimney stone, taken from Wrighte's original house. It was not until after 1850, however, that Crown lands were subdivided and sold. Traffic along a main road running through the district encouraged the building of a hotel at Box Hill in 1853. Its owner named it the White Horse hotel and the name was bestowed on the road. Box Hill Post Office opened on 1 February 1861, being the first official use of the name. The postmaster proposed the name, derived from Box Hill, Surrey, England, near his birthplace. In 1871, Box Hill township's population was 154 and the district relied on orchards, vineyards and mixed farming. The extension of the railway line from Camberwell to Lilydale in 1882 included a station at Box Hill, but there were also stations at Canterbury and Surrey Hills, to the west. They attracted subdivisions and development ahead of Box Hill. Growth came, though, with a school opening in Box Hill in 1887 and the town became the seat of the Nunawading Shire Council, which met at the Box Hill Courthouse. In the mid-1880s, Box Hill became a favoured area for landscape artists who wanted to paint the Australian bush en plein air. These artists, among them Arthur Streeton, Tom Roberts and Frederick McCubbin, established the Box Hill artists' camp, and formed what would become known as the Heidelberg School, the first distinctively Australian movement in Western art.  Development  Unlike suburbs closer to Melbourne, Box Hill lacked the web of tramlines, which promoted residential development beyond the reach of the railway line. In 1916‚Äì17, tramlines reached the western edge of what in a short time would be the Box Hill Municipality, at Burwood, Mont Albert and Wattle Park. The years after World War I saw Box Hill's turn for residential growth. A girls' technical school was built in 1924 and a boys' high school in 1930. During World War II a boys' technical school was opened. Box Hill Town Hall The new town hall on Whitehorse Road opened in April 1935. One of the arguments for its construction was that \\"the boon it would prove to the local brickworks, which had just resumed production after a period of suspension\\". The Box Hill Presbyterian (now Uniting) Church building was originally the West Melbourne Presbyterian Church built 1867 on the corner of Lonsdale and William Streets; a final service was held on 3 February 1935, following which the building was dismantled and re-erected on its present site, being opened in late 1935. After the end of the Second World War, Box Hill was suburbanised, but Box Hill South and Box Hill North remained comparatively undeveloped.  \\"Melbourne's second city\\"  High-rise buildings with a tram in the foreground Post-war housing expansion included a Housing Commission estate in Box Hill South. A district hospital opened in 1956. The shopping area enjoyed growth and prosperity which, ironically, by the end of the 1950s was putting a strain on it; there was not enough space for parking. The development of Myer Eastland and Doncaster Shoppingtown in the late 1960s took trade away, and the shopping centre regained custom by undergrounding the railway line and station and building Box Hill Central on land, which included the old market. In 1954, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works designated Box Hill as one of five district centres for metropolitan Melbourne. The plan has succeeded in Box Hill. In addition to the shopping centre, the Box Hill TAFE and several office buildings have strengthened its centrality in the region. Apart from commercial functions there are large reserves, with ovals in three directions, about a kilometre from Box Hill Central. Box Hill South lies between Canterbury Road and Burwood East, about two kilometres square. Its proximity to trams was better than Box Hill North's and its residential growth was substantially pre- and early post-war. The Box Hill Golf Club is nearby and a linear park continues along Gardiners Creek. There are church educational institutions; Kingswood College (Anglican and then Uniting) and the Christian Brothers' Teachers' College and St. Leo's College (1952 and 1957). In 1971, a sister city relationship was forged with Matsudo, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. \\"Box Hill\\" is the name of a department store in Matsudo (:ja:„Éú„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çπ„Éí„É´). Box Hill City was amalgamated with Nunawading City on 15 December 1994, to form Whitehorse City, renewing the boundaries that began with the Nunawading Parish and subsequent Shire. More recently, Box Hill has experienced a construction boom, and is now home to high-rise buildings that are unusually tall for one of Melbourne's middle suburbs. These include the Australian Taxation Office's Box Hill Tower, the Whitehorse Towers and the 36-storey Sky One, which, at 122 metres, is the tallest building in Melbourne beyond the CBD. More high-rises are under construction, including New Chinatown, a $450 million twin tower project which will serve as a modern \\"sibling\\" of the historic Chinatown in the CBD. The continued transformation of Box Hill's skyline has seen it be dubbed as \\"Melbourne's second city\\".  Facilities  The White Horse, Whitehorse Road, Box Hill Box Hill has a shopping precinct. These range from the shops along Station Street and Whitehorse Road, to the suburb's two shopping centres. Centro Box Hill, formerly Box Hill Central is integrated with a bus interchange and the Box Hill railway station. The neighbouring Centro Box Hill (north section, formerly Centro Whitehorse). In late 2007, the two shopping centres merged. They are now known as buildings \\"South\\" (Formerly Centro Box Hill) and \\"North\\" (formerly Centro Whitehorse,) or \\"Box Hill Centro\\", with centre management located in the South building. Box Hill is also home to a number of recreational services, such as Neighbourhood Houses, a number of Scout Groups, including 11th Box Hill, Mont Albert North (formerly 10th/13th Box Hill),http://www.montalbertnorthscouts.org.au 6th Box Hill and 1st Mont Albert Scout Groups. The Box Hill Community Centre, located 1 km south of Box Hill Central, also provides a number of services to the local community. Box Hill Hospital serves Box Hill and its surrounding suburbs. Epworth Eastern, a private hospital, opened in 2005 opposite Box Hill Hospital.  Demographics  St Andrew's Uniting Church At the time of the 2016 Australian census, 64.7% of Box Hill residents reported being born in foreign countries, the most common being China (excluding Taiwan and the SARs; 27.6%), Malaysia (4.8%), India (4.2%), Hong Kong (3.0%) and South Korea (1.7%). 36.9% of residents only speak English at home. Mandarin Chinese is the second most commonly spoken language (28.3%), followed by Cantonese (9.8%), Korean (1.7%), Hindi (1.3%) and Vietnamese (1.2%). Self-described non-religious people made up the largest single group at 46.3% of the population, followed by Catholics (13.5%), Buddhists (7.8%) and Anglicans (4.5%). 10.1% of Box Hill residents did not state their religious affiliation in the census. Compared to Australia as a whole, Box Hill residents are much less likely to be Australian-born, and are more likely to have stated \\"No Religion\\" on the census.  Education  Campus of Box Hill High School The suburb of Box Hill has several schools, including Box Hill High School, Box Hill Senior Secondary College, Our Lady of Sion College and St. Francis Xavier's Catholic Primary School. For mature students, Box Hill Institute of TAFE and St Leo International College provide further education. There are two kindergartens in the area; St Peter's Anglican Kindergarten and Goodstart Early Learning Box Hill. Schools in neighbouring suburbs include Koonung Secondary College, Kingswood College and Roberts McCubbin Primary School.  Sport  Box Hill City Oval The Box Hill Hawks are a local Australian rules football club, playing in the Victorian Football League and are based at the Box Hill City Oval. This team was formerly known as the Mustangs, named for the city's mascot, the White Horse. They are currently affiliated with the Hawthorn Hawks. Another football team, The Whitehorse Pioneers, competes in the Eastern Football League. Box Hill United Soccer Club currently competes in the National Premier Leagues Victoria 2. Box Hill Athletic Club, founded in 1932, survived through the war years and became powerful after the 1956 Olympic Games, held in Melbourne. The club's original training ground was at Surrey Park, Elgar Road South, an area provided by the Box Hill Council. After several years of filling in and grading, the area known as Hagenauer's Park was made available for athletics. Aerial perspective of Aqualink Box Hill Box Hill has an 18-hole golf course, located at 202 Station Street. The course suits golfers of all abilities and new members are constantly being inducted. The club offers junior development programs. In basketball, the Whitehorse Mustangs celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2009, having been formed when the North Box Hill and Surrey Hills clubs merged. The club fields junior teams each Saturday in the Eastern District Junior Basketball Association (EDJBA), with home games played at the basketball stadium of Box Hill High School. It also runs weekly social competitions for both men and women and fields a championship men's team in the Melbourne Metropolitan Basketball League (MMBL). The Box Hill Action Indoor Sports Centre also provides residents with dedicated facilities for indoor soccer, cricket and netball. Aqualink Box Hill (formerly Whitehorse Aquatic and Leisure Centre), run by Whitehorse Council, provides residents with an indoor and outdoor pool, basketball courts, a gym, squash and tennis courts. The swim club, Surrey Park, swim at Aqualink Box Hill. The club uses the facilities of Aqualink. The surrounding parklands include (aside from a large lake, now filled with water, but once used as a quarry) a baseball diamond, a football oval and cricket pitches. Box Hill Rugby Club play at RHL Sparks Reserve in the Dewar Shield competition.  Transport  Box Hill railway station, viewed from platform four, looking east Box Hill is a major transport hub for the City of Whitehorse and surrounding suburbs. Box Hill railway station is located under Box Hill Central Shopping Centre and is served by the Belgrave and Lilydale railway lines. The complex also includes a large bus terminus, linking commuters to a broad range of destinations across most Melbourne suburbs. Tram route 109, which runs along Whitehorse Road, was extended from Union Road, Surrey Hills, to Box Hill and opened in May 2003. It runs to Port Melbourne via the city. There are V/Line coaches that run from Melbourne (Southern Cross) to Mansfield / Mount Buller. The coach stop is opposite Box Hill Town Hall, on Whitehorse Road.

Gathering initially as part of a practical joke, members of \\"The Vicious Circle\\", as they dubbed themselves, met for lunch each day at the Algonquin Hotel from 1919 until roughly 1929. At these luncheons they engaged in wisecracks, wordplay, and witticisms that, through the newspaper columns of Round Table members, were disseminated across the country. Daily association with each other, both at the luncheons and outside of them, inspired members of the Circle to collaborate creatively. The entire group worked together successfully only once, however, to create a revue called No Sirree! which helped launch a Hollywood career for Round Tabler Robert Benchley. In its ten years of association, the Round Table and a number of its members acquired national reputations, both for their contributions to literature and for their sparkling wit. Although some of their contemporaries, and later in life even some of its members, disparaged the group, its reputation has endured long after its dissolution. Origin The group that would become the Round Table began meeting in June 1919 as the result of a practical joke carried out by theatrical press agent John Peter Toohey. Toohey, annoyed at The New York Times drama critic Alexander Woollcott for refusing to plug one of Toohey's clients (Eugene O'Neill) in his column, organized a luncheon supposedly to welcome Woollcott back from World War I, where he had been a correspondent for Stars and Stripes. Instead Toohey used the occasion to poke fun at Woollcott on a number of fronts. Woollcott's enjoyment of the joke and the success of the event prompted Toohey to suggest that the group in attendance meet at the Algonquin each day for lunch. The group first gathered in the Algonquin's Pergola Room (later called the Oak Room) at a long rectangular table. As they increased in number, Algonquin manager Frank Case moved them to the Rose Room and a round table.Hermann, pp. 19‚Äì20 Initially the group called itself \\"The Board\\" and the luncheons \\"Board meetings\\". After being assigned a waiter named Luigi, the group re-christened itself \\"Luigi Board\\". Finally they became \\"The Vicious Circle\\" although \\"The Round Table\\" gained wide currency after a caricature by cartoonist Edmund Duffy of the Brooklyn Eagle portrayed the group sitting at a round table and wearing armor.Herrmann, p. 20 Membership Charter members of the Round Table included: * Franklin Pierce Adams, columnist * Robert Benchley, humorist and actor * Irving Berlin, American composer and lyricist, * Heywood Broun, columnist and sportswriter (married to Ruth Hale) * Marc Connelly, playwright * Ruth Hale, freelance writer who worked for women's rights * George S.

The group was devoted to games, including cribbage and poker. The group had its own poker club, the Thanatopsis Literary and Inside Straight Club, which met at the hotel on Saturday nights. Regulars at the game included Kaufman, Adams, Broun, Ross and Woollcott, with non-Round Tablers Herbert Bayard Swope, silk merchant Paul Hyde Bonner, baking heir Raoul Fleischmann, actor Harpo Marx, and writer Ring Lardner sometimes sitting in.Meade, pp. 76‚Äì7 The group also played charades (which they called simply \\"The Game\\") and the \\"I can give you a sentence\\" game, which spawned Dorothy Parker's memorable sentence using the word horticulture: \\"You can lead a horticulture but you can't make her think.\\"Herrmann, p. 23 Members often visited Neshobe Island, a private island co-owned by several \\"Algonks\\"‚Äîbut governed by Woollcott as a \\"benevolent tyrant\\", as his biographer Samuel Hopkins Adams charitably put itAdams, Samuel Hopkins. A. Woollcott: His Life and His World. Reynold & Hitchcock, 1945. p. 186‚Äîlocated on several acres in the middle of Lake Bomoseen in Vermont. There they would engage in their usual array of games including Wink murder, which they called simply \\"Murder\\", plus croquet. A number of Round Tablers were inveterate practical jokers, constantly pulling pranks on one another. As time went on the jokes became ever more elaborate. Harold Ross and Jane Grant once spent weeks playing a particularly memorable joke on Woollcott involving a prized portrait of himself. They had several copies made, each slightly more askew than the last, and would periodically secretly swap them out and then later comment to Woollcott \\"What on earth is wrong with your portrait?\\" until Woollcott was beside himself. Eventually they returned the original portrait.Hermann, p. 28 No Sirree! Given the literary and theatrical activities of the Round Table members, it was perhaps inevitable that they would write and stage their own revue. No Sirree!, staged for one night only in April 1922, was a take-off of a then-popular European touring revue called La Chauve-Souris, directed by Nikita Balieff. No Sirree! had its genesis at the studio of Neysa McMein, which served as something of a salon for Round Tablers away from the Algonquin. Acts included: \\"Opening Chorus\\" featuring Woollcott, Toohey, Kaufman, Connelly, Adams and Benchley with violinist Jascha Heifetz providing offstage, off-key accompaniment; \\"He Who Gets Flapped\\", a musical number featuring the song \\"The Everlastin' Ingenue Blues\\" written by Dorothy Parker and performed by Robert Sherwood accompanied by \\"chorus girls\\" including Tallulah Bankhead, Helen Hayes, Ruth Gillmore, Lenore Ulric and Mary Brandon; \\"Zowie, or the Curse of an Akins Heart\\"; \\"The Greasy Hag, an O'Neill Play in One Act\\" with Kaufman, Connelly and Woollcott; and \\"Mr. Whim Passes By‚ÄîAn A. A. Milne Play.\\"Altman, p. 203 The only item of note to emerge from No Sirree! was Robert Benchley's contribution, The Treasurer's Report. Benchley's disjointed parody so delighted those in attendance that Irving Berlin hired Benchley in 1923 to deliver the Report as part of Berlin's Music Box Revue for $500 a week.Altman, p. 208‚Äì9 In 1928, Report was later made into a short sound film in the Fox Movietone sound-on-film system by Fox Film Corporation. The film marked the beginning of a second career for Benchley in Hollywood. With the success of No Sirree! the Round Tablers hoped to duplicate it with an \\"official\\" Vicious Circle production open to the public with material performed by professional actors. Kaufman and Connelly funded the revue, named The Forty-niners.Altman, p. 207 The revue opened in November 1922 and was a failure, running for just 15 performances.Meade, pp. 104‚Äì5 Decline As members of the Round Table moved into ventures outside New York City, inevitably the group drifted apart. By the early 1930s the Vicious Circle was broken. Edna Ferber said she realized it when she arrived at the Rose Room for lunch one day in 1932 and found the group's table occupied by a family from Kansas. Frank Case was asked what happened to the group. He shrugged and replied, \\"What became of the reservoir at Fifth Avenue and Forty-Second Street? These things do not last forever.\\"Meade, p. 320 Some members of the group remained friends after its dissolution. Parker and Benchley in particular remained close up until his death in 1945, although her political leanings did strain their relationship.Altman 314 Others, as the group itself would come to understand when it gathered following Woollcott's death in 1943, simply realized that they had nothing to say to one another. Public response and legacy Because a number of the members of the Round Table had regular newspaper columns, the activities and quips of various Round Table members were reported in the national press. This brought Round Tablers widely into the public consciousness as renowned wits. Not all of their contemporaries were fans of the group. Their critics accused them of logrolling, or exchanging favorable plugs of one another's works, and of rehearsing their witticisms in advance.Hermann, p. 29 James Thurber (who lived in the hotel) was a detractor of the group, accusing them of being too consumed by their elaborate practical jokes. H. L. Mencken, who was much admired by many in the Circle, was also a critic, commenting to fellow writer Anita Loos that \\"their ideals were those of a vaudeville actor, one who is extremely 'in the know' and inordinately trashy\\".Hermann, p. 30 The group showed up in the 1923 best- seller Black Oxen by Gertrude Atherton. She sarcastically described a group she called \\"the Sophisticates\\": Groucho Marx, brother of Round Table associate Harpo, was never comfortable amidst the viciousness of the Vicious Circle. Therein he remarked \\"The price of admission is a serpent's tongue and a half- concealed stiletto.\\" Even some members of the Round Table disparaged it later in life. Dorothy Parker in particular criticized the group. Despite Parker's bleak assessment and while it is true that some members of the Round Table are perhaps now \\"famous for being famous\\" instead of for their literary output, Round Table members and associates contributed to the literary landscape, including Pulitzer Prize-winning work by Circle members Kaufman, Connelly and Sherwood (who won four) and by associate Ferber and the legacy of Ross's New Yorker. Others made lasting contributions to the realms of stage and screen ‚Äî Tallulah Bankhead and Eva Le Gallienne became Broadway greats and the films of Harpo and Benchley remain popular; and Parker has remained renowned for her short stories and literary reviews. Algonquin Hotel Landmark Sign The Algonquin Round Table, as well as the number of other literary and theatrical greats who lodged there, helped earn the Algonquin Hotel its status as a New York City Historic Landmark. The hotel was so designated in 1987. In 1996 the hotel was designated a national literary landmark by the Friends of Libraries USA based on the contributions of \\"The Round Table Wits\\". The organization's bronze plaque is attached to the front of the hotel. Although the Rose Room was removed from the Algonquin in a 1998 remodel, the hotel paid tribute to the group by commissioning and hanging the painting A Vicious Circle by Natalie Ascencios, depicting the Round Table and also created a replica of the original table. The hotel occasionally stages an original musical production, The Talk of the Town, in the Oak Room. Its latest production started September 11, 2007 and ran through the end of the year. A film about the members, The Ten-Year Lunch (1987), won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. The dramatic film Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle (1994) recounts the Round Table from the perspective of Dorothy Parker. In popular culture Portions of the 1981 film Rich and Famous were set in the Algonquin and one of the film's characters, Liz Hamilton (played by Jacqueline Bisset), refers to the Round Table during the film. In 1991, the Algonquin Round Table was mentioned in the Seinfeld season 2 episode \\"The Phone Message\\". The Algonquin Round Table was featured in \\"The Young Indiana Jones and the Scandal of 1920\\", a 1993 episode of the TV series The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, in which the title character meets the group and attends at least two lunches. Wonderful Nonsense - The Algonquin Round Table is a documentary produced for the DVD release of that film in 2008.Young Indy on DVD: A Tour of Volume 3: Disc 8 on StarWars.com (backup link on Archive.org) In 1997, a reference was made to the \\"Algonquin Kid's Table\\" in the Season 4, Episode 3 premier of the show Friends. In 2009, Robert Benchley's grandson, Nat Benchley, and co-editor Kevin C. Fitzpatrick published The Lost Algonquin Round Table, a collection of the early writings of the group.

It was created in 1866 for the prominent Liberal politician John Wodehouse, 3rd Baron Wodehouse. During his long political career he notably held office as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Secretary of State for the Colonies, Secretary of State for India and Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. At first a Liberal like his father, he later joined the Labour Party, becoming the first Labour member of the House of Lords.

Its mission statement is \\"to promote the motorcycling lifestyle and protect the future of motorcycling.\\" The organization was founded in 1924 and as of October 2016 had more than 1,100 chartered clubs. For clubs and promoters it provides guidance and advice on running events and rallies, and allows affiliated members to vote on AMA matters. It also has a corporate membership category with representatives from the US motorcycle industry. The AMA is the official national federation representative (FMN) for the United States of America in the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), and organizes the US teams and riders for FIM-sanctioned events, including the International Six Day Enduro, Motocross Des Nations and Trials Des Nations. Outlaw and one-percenter The AMA was a whites-only organization from its inception in 1924 until the 1950s, not allowing African Americans to join for its first 30 years. Prior to the acceptance of black members, the term outlaw motorcycle club could refer to either a white counterculture biker club that was \\"uninterested in 'square' events and competitions\\", or else a club that accepted non-white members and was therefore not allowed to participate in the AMA. In the 1920s and 1930s, black hillclimbing racer William B. Johnson evaded the whites-only restriction and obtained an AMA membership card, which allowed him to compete around the Northeastern United States and become perhaps the first black AMA member. In 1995, AMA President Ed Youngblood said that as a consequence of this racist policy, blacks continued to be underrepresented in AMA events for decades after the segregationist policy was rescinded. That year, Youngblood presented black AMA member Norman Gaines in their membership advertisement in the campaign \\"I want to protect my rights as a motorcyclist. That's why I'm an AMA member\\" in both the AMA member magazine and Motorcyclist magazine.Motorcyclist magazine page 35 August 1995 issue The term one-percenter was coined after the 1947 Hollister riot in Hollister, California. The AMA is said to have responded that 99% of motorcyclists were law-abiding citizens, implying the last one percent were outlaws. The AMA now says they have no record of such a statement to the press, and call this story apocryphal. One-percenter motorcycle clubs are often also known as outlaw motorcycle gangs or OMGs according to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Competitions The AMA sanctions over 2,000 events each year hosted by chartered clubs and promoters alike across the entire country in the disciplines of Motocross, Off-Road and Track Racing. Each discipline is guided by the AMA Racing Rule Book which is organized, written and voted on each year by AMA congress which is made up of AMA delegates from across the entire country representing their areas, disciplines and districts. In addition to a yearly congress the AMA also organizes the AMA National Awards Banquet that awards championships to all of the AMA Amateur National championship from across the country in addition to naming the AMA Racer of the Year, AMA Youth Racer of the Year, AMA Womens Racer of the Year, AMA Club of the Year and more.

The AMA also maintains the Motorcycle Hall of Fame located near Columbus, Ohio. It is the designated governing body of motorcycle sport in the US by the world governing body, the F√©d√©ration Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM). AMA Pro Racing was formed in 1994 to respond to the growth of motorcycle racing in United States and holds many events. The AMA Road Racing Series includes the AMA American Superbike Championship, the AMA Daytona Sportbike Championship (which incorporates the former AMA Supersport Championship and the now inactive AMA Formula Xtreme), and the new AMA Supersport Championship, which is limited to riders of age 16-21 on near stock 600cc motorcycles. Off-road racing series include AMA Grand National Championship, AMA Supercross, AMA Motocross Championship, AMA Hillclimb, AMA Supermoto Championship and AMA EnduroCross Championship. On March 7, 2008, the AMA Pro Racing series was sold to the Daytona Motorsports Group (DMG), headed by Roger Edmondson and Jim France. The DMG became responsible for the AMA Superbike Series, AMA Motocross Series, AMA Flat Track Series, AMA Supermoto Series, AMA Hillclimb Series and ATV Pro Racing. The sale did not include the AMA Supercross and AMA Arenacross Series, whose rights are currently owned by Feld Entertainment. DMG would license the AMA name and trademarks to promote the motorcycle racing series. The new management sparked criticism among some of the press and fans for allegedly alienating the factory teams and for introducing NASCAR style rules such as rolling start and pace car. DMG was replaced by MotoAmerica as AMA Superbikes promoter in 2015. American Motorcyclist American Motorcyclist magazine is published by the AMA. It has a monthly circulation of 260,000 copies.

See: London Gazette: no. 28863. p. 6171. 4 August 1914. Retrieved 2011-08-18. He had already been created Baron Kitchener of Khartoum, and of Aspall in the County of Suffolk, in 1898, Viscount Kitchener of Khartoum, and of the Vaal in the Colony of Transvaal, and of Aspall in the County of Suffolk, in 1902, and was made Baron Denton, of Denton in the County of Kent, and Viscount Broome, of Broome in the County of Kent, at the same time he was granted the earldom. These titles were also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The barony of 1898 was created with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. However, all the other titles (those of 1902 and 1914) were created with remainder to #the heirs male of his body, failing which to #his first daughter and the heirs male of her body, failing which to #his other daughters and the heirs male of their bodies, failing which to #his elder brother Colonel Henry Kitchener and the heirs male of his body, failing which to #his youngest brother Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Kitchener (who was alive at the time of the 1902 creation but deceased at the time of the 1914 creations) and the heirs male of his body.

Coat of arms of Kitchener augmentations of honour, as displayed on his Order of the Garter stall plate in St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle The first earl died unmarried and childless in 1916, which resulted in the extinction of the barony created in 1898. However, he was succeeded in the other titles under the special remainder by his elder brother, Colonel Henry Kitchener, as second earl. His only son, Henry, Viscount Broome, predeceased him, and so he was succeeded by his grandson, also Henry, Viscount Broome, as third earl. The third earl died unmarried and childless in 2011. His younger brother, the Hon. Charles Kitchener, had died in 1982, and the line of Lieutenant-General Sir Walter Kitchener had failed on the death of his younger son, Squadron Leader Henry Kitchener, in 1984. The titles therefore became extinct. The Hon. Charles Kitchener, brother of the third earl, had one daughter, Emma Kitchener (born 1963), who on the third earl's death became the first earl's heir general. She is a lady-in-waiting to Princess Michael of Kent and is married to the actor, screenwriter, film director and novelist Lord Fellowes. Fellowes publicly expressed his dissatisfaction that the proposals to change the rules of royal succession were not extended to peerages, which would have allowed his wife to succeed as 4th Countess on her uncle's death.Julian Fellowes: inheritance laws denying my wife a title are outrageous On 9 May 2012 the Queen issued a Royal Warrant of Precedence allowing Lady Fellowes to enjoy the same rank and title of the daughter of an earl, as if her late father had survived his brother and therefore succeeded to the title.

Jolly is owned by the limited company 'Dansk Coladrik A/S' (Danish Coladrink Ltd). Jolly Cola is now produced by the Danish brewery Vestfyen, which also produces Jolly Light, the sports drink Jolly Time and Jolly Orange. Dansk Coladrik was founded in 1959 to compete with the American brands before they hit the danish markets, especially Coca-Cola. Many products from the USA were copied in this way shortly before they were introduced in Denmark, so people already had a connection with the Danish brand. Dansk Coladrink is an independent company owned by the stock holders, however the brewery Vestfyen owns the majority of the stocks in the company. Up until the 1980s, Jolly Cola had a market share of about 40% of the Danish cola market. This was extraordinary, as Denmark is one of a few countries in the world, where another cola than the original Coca-Cola has had a larger market share. Jolly Cola is probably most famous for its slogan ‚ÄúSay Jolly to your cola!‚Äù, but on its 50th birthday, this slogan was changed into ‚ÄúFree your taste‚Äù. The bottles and cans today has the slogan ‚ÄúEN √ÜGTE DANSK ORIGINAL - SIDEN 1959‚Äù meaning \\"A REAL DANISH ORIGINAL - SINCE 1959\\" History Following World War II, many countries in the world viewed Coca-Cola as synonymous with the US and an American life-style, and as the US developed and increased its influence on society, so did Coca-Cola. In the meantime, the Danish population still had to wait until 1959, before they could buy a bottle of Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola had been marketed with moderate success from the middle of the 1930s, but then came a war, followed by rationing of sugar and finally a special tax on cola, which made the soft drink just as expensive as a beer, and therefore kept it out of the Danish market. The taxation came as a result of skilled lobbyism, carried out by breweries and producers of mineral water ‚Äì and it worked as intended. Following the implementation of the tax in 1953, only 10,000 litres of cola soft drinks were sold in Denmark a year, primarily produced by minor Danish producers of mineral water, avoiding the competition from the American giant. However, the opposition against the taxation grew, and by the end of the 1950s it was only the communists and conservative powers in Danish politics, which had close connections to the brewing industry, that wanted a prohibitive surtax on what a member of the Danish Communist Party called ‚Äúa bitter cup‚Äù. An outline of the first Jolly advertisement. When the Danish producers finally realised that they could not keep Coca-Cola out of the Danish market anymore, they quickly changed their strategy. In January 1959 18 breweries and producers of mineral water went together to form ‚ÄòDansk Coladrik A/S‚Äô. This initiative was instigated by Carlsberg and Tuborg so as to produce an original Danish cola that was to be sold nationwide. The soft drink was named Jolly Cola and was an all-out copy product. This regarded not only the taste, but also the organisation behind the product, which completely resembled Coca- Cola, especially in terms of having a strong and centralised control of quality and marketing, combined with local bottling departments. Suddenly, the strategy seemed to be that if you could not get rid of Coca-Cola, the least you could do was to ensure that the Danish population drank Danish produced cola. To a great extent, this was a success, and when the taxation was removed and ‚Äòthe great Danish cola war‚Äô broke out in July 1959, Jolly Cola actually conquered a significant part of the new market. In July 1959 alone, nine million bottles of Jolly Cola were sold, compared to five million bottles of Coca-Cola. This was an incredible number compared to an annual sale of 40 to 50,000 bottles in 1958. Naturally, the sheer interest of the news explains a part of the increased sale, but so does the summer of 1959, which was exceptionally good. Nevertheless, when the market finally stabilised, roughly every fifth sold soft drink in Denmark was a cola, and approximately 40% was Jolly Cola. Jolly Cola maintained this market share until the 1980s. A photograph of a bottle of Jolly Cola taken in 2010. There are several explanations for Jolly Cola‚Äôs success. However, the most important one is that ‚ÄòDansk Coladrik‚Äô could make use of the brewing industry‚Äôs comprehensive network, distributing system and knowledge of the Danish market. Another reason is that it was only possible to buy Coca-Cola in Copenhagen and a few larger cities in Jutland in the early years of the hectic ‚Äòcola war‚Äô. Hence, it was not until the 1960s that it was possible to buy Coca-Cola nationwide. This ensured that Jolly Cola was a well-established product in many places when Coca-Cola finally ventured into the market. Thirdly, it was due to great marketing. Dansk Coladrik had tapped their cola in regular soft drink bottles. This made it easier for the retail industry to administer the returnable bottle system, but it also made it possible to launch Jolly Cola as ‚ÄúThe Big Cola‚Äù (a slogan that not coincidentally resembled Pepsi‚Äôs successful 1930s US slogan for its big 12 ounce bottle). A Danish soft drink bottle contained exactly 25 cl, whereas the characteristic ‚Äòchubby‚Äô Coca-Cola bottle only contained 19 cl. The argument about value for your money was important in a time where a soft drink was considered to be a luxury product. (The story of Jolly Cola is based on the work of Klaus Petersen and Niels Arne S√∏rensen from the Institute of History, Culture and Society). Today‚Äôs Jolly Cola In the 1980s Jolly Cola still had around 60% of the Danish cola market, but in the 1990s they experienced a decrease in sales. In 1999 the failing sales numbers forced the Danish Consumers Cooperative Society (Coop amba) to remove Jolly Cola from its shelves. Following this, Jolly Cola only made up 6% of the total Danish soft drink market in 2002, which was again reduced to 2% in 2003. In the same year, a trial between the brewery Vestfyen and the association of Danish breweries almost compromised Jolly Cola‚Äôs existence. Vestfyen believed that the association of Danish breweries would rather market Pepsi Cola at the expense of Jolly Cola. In September 2003, however, Vestfyen took over all stocks dealing with the struggling soft drink so as to engage in a turn-around of the product. This became an immense success, and in 2004 Jolly Cola made up 25% of Coop amba's cola sales. Labels Jolly‚Äôs labels have changed a couple of times during the years. However, what they have in common is a retro design. It is the same look/design which is reappearing in the new logo. Jolly labels through time. In the 1980s and 1990s there were quizzes, crossword puzzles and common proverbs on the back of Jolly‚Äôs labels. Jolly music quiz from the 1980s. Jolly crossword puzzle.

At the 2016 Census, Blackburn South had a population of 10,793. Blackburn South is bordered by Canterbury Road, Middleborough Road, Eley Road, and by an irregular line to the east of Blackburn Road. Furthermore, the suburb is informally divided between Blackburn South Proper to the west of Blackburn Road, and Blackburn South Heights to the east of Blackburn Road. Blackburn South Proper Residents Association (BSPRA) is campaigning to amalgamate Blackburn South Heights into neighbouring Forest Hill. History Prior to development in the 1950s, Blackburn was primarily covered by orchards. Orchard Grove, an important access road through the suburb, was named so for this reason. Some original farm houses still stand in the area. During the 1960s and 1970s Blackburn South was a working-class neighbourhood before becoming a more middle-class neighbourhood in the early 1980s. South Blackburn Post Office on Canterbury Road opened around February 1954 and was renamed Blackburn South around 1957. Kinkuna Post Office on Vicki Street near Blackburn Road opened on 8 October 1960 and closed in 1979. The Blackburn South Sharps were the most prominent of the 1972-1977 Melbourne sharpie gangs. Sharpies were an early precursor to the Australian phenomenon of bogans. The Blackburn South Sharps have been the subject of several modern exhibitions and documentaries due to the numerous photographs they took around Blackburn South landmarks. Transport The major east-west thoroughfare through Blackburn South is Canterbury Road. From the south, it is also accessible from Burwood Highway. Major north-south roads through the suburb include Middleborough Road and Blackburn Road; both connect to the Eastern Freeway. Blackburn south has also Laburnum Train station and not far from Blackburn and Box Hill Station. Melbourne PTV bus routes service the area. Recreation Blackburn South, and its surrounding areas features several excellent parks. These include Wurundjeri Walk Trail, which provides an excellent creek-side walk. There are cricket ovals at Mirrabooka Oval and Eley Park, the latter also featuring a tennis club. Other smaller parks are also tucked away in the suburb, including Edinburgh Patch and one at Wardle Close, a green corridor between McCracken Avenue and Shawlands Avenue and the Fulton Road - Finch Place link. Education Blackburn South is home to Laburnum Primary School, Orchard Grove Primary School, St. Luke the Evangelist School, Indra Pre-School, Holbury Children's Centre, True Maple Bilingual Early Learning Centre, Aurora School and Blackburn English Language School. Its high school, Blackburn South High, was amalgamated into Forest Hill Secondary College as the Blackburn South campus in the early 1990s, but has since been closed and demolished. The Aurora School now sits on the site of the old high school. Blackburn South was also home to several small primary schools, four of which were amalgamated into Orchard Grove Primary School in 1991. These were Blackburn South (demolished to build housing), Killoura (now the Blackburn English Language School), Mirrabooka (the site that Orchard Grove Primary now sits) and Warrawong (demolished to build housing, although the art room still stands and is now the Eley Park Community Association Warrawong Annex). Blackburn East Primary School, which was not part of the initial amalgamation, closed in 1993. Retail Blackburn South itself features shops along Canterbury Road, including a Woolworths Supermarket and a McDonald's Restaurant. There are also smaller shops, known as milk bars at the corner of Fulton and Holland Road, Indra Road, Vicki Street and Eley Road. It does feature proximity to Blackburn, Box Hill and Forest Hill; easily accessible by either car or bus.

They have been administered by the Democratic National Committee since the 1852 national convention. The primary goal of the Democratic National Convention is to officially nominate a candidate for president and vice president, adopt a comprehensive party platform and unify the party. Pledged delegates from all fifty U.S. states and from American dependencies and territories such as Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and superdelegates which are unpledged delegates representing the Democratic establishment, attend the convention and cast their votes to choose the Party's presidential candidate. Like the Republican National Convention, the Democratic National Convention marks the formal end of the primary election period and the start of the general election season. In 2020 all parties replaced the usual conventions with short online programs. Delegations The party's presidential nominee is chosen primarily by pledged delegates, which are in turn selected through a series of individual state caucuses and primary elections. Pledged delegates are classified into three categories: * At-large pledged delegates are allocated and elected at the statewide level. * District pledged delegates are allocated and elected at a district level, usually the congressional district, but sometimes by state or territory legislative district. * Add-on or PLEO pledged delegates, which allow for representation by party leaders and elected officials within the state. Unpledged superdelegates, delegates whose votes are not bound to the outcome of a state's caucus or primary, only vote in the event of a contested nomination. These superdelegates may also be called unpledged PLEO (party leaders and elected officials) delegates. The size of delegations to the Democratic National Convention, for each state, territory, or other political subdivision, are described in the party's quadrennial Call for the Democratic National Convention. Pledged delegate allocationAllocation formula for the 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C.= Since 2012, the number of pledged delegates allocated to each of the 50 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. is based on two main factors: (1) the proportion of votes each state gave to the Democratic candidate in the last three presidential elections, and (2) the number of electoral votes each state has in the Electoral College. The calculations for the 2020 convention basically consist of the following three steps: Step 1: The following formula is first used to determine each jurisdiction's allocation factor: \\\\text{Allocation factor} = {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\times \\\\left ( {\\\\text{SDV}_{\\\\text{2008}} + \\\\text{SDV}_{\\\\text{2012}} + \\\\text{SDV}_{\\\\text{2016}} \\\\over \\\\text{TDV}_{\\\\text{2008}} + \\\\text{TDV}_{\\\\text{2012}} + \\\\text{TDV}_{\\\\text{2016}}} + {\\\\text{SEV} \\\\over 538} \\\\right ) where : SDV = The state's Democratic vote in the indicated presidential election : TDV = The nationwide total Democratic vote in the indicated presidential election : SEV = The state's electoral votes Step 2: The base delegation for each state and the District of Columbia is then determined by multiplying its allocation factor by 3,200 (rounded to the nearest integer): \\\\text{Base delegation} = \\\\text{Allocation factor} \\\\times 3200 Step 3: Finally, the jurisdiction's base delegation is used to calculate the number of its District, At-Large, and pledged PLEO (party leaders and elected officials who are not superdelegates) delegates (fractions 0.5 and above are rounded to the next highest integer): \\\\text{At-large delegates} = \\\\text{Base delegation} \\\\times 0.25 \\\\text{District delegates} = \\\\text{Base delegation} - \\\\text{At-large delegates} \\\\text{Pledged PLEO delegates} = \\\\text{Base delegation} \\\\times 0.15 =Allocations to other jurisdictions= Jurisdictions without electoral votes are instead given a fixed amount of pledged delegates. In 2020, American Samoa, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands each get six at-large delegates. Democrats Abroad gets 12 at-large and one pledged PLEO. Puerto Rico is assigned 44 base votes in 2020, then the same formulas used in Step 3 above for U.S. states are used to calculate the territory's at-large, district, and PLEO pledged delegates: \\\\text{At-large delegates}_{\\\\text{PR2020}} = 44 \\\\times 0.25 = 11 \\\\text{District delegates}_{\\\\text{PR2020}} = 44 - \\\\text{At-large delegates}_{\\\\text{PR2020}} = 44 - 11 = 33 \\\\text{Pledged PLEO delegates}_{\\\\text{PR2020}} = 44 \\\\times 0.15 = 6.6 \\\\to 7 =Bonus delegates= The Democratic Party awards bonus pledged delegates to each jurisdiction based on two factors: timing and clustering. The timing criteria is based on when the state holds its primaries/caucuses, with those states scheduling their contests in May and June getting the higher bonus. For clustering, three or more neighboring states must concurrently begin on the same date. The bonus awarded is then a percentage increase in the jurisdiction's delegation (rounded to the nearest integer). A fourth of the bonus delegates are then designated as District, and the other three-fourths become At-Large. The bonuses are: * Timing Stage 1 (before April): No bonus * Timing Stage 2 (April): 10 percent increase * Cluster: 15 percent increase * Both Timing Stage 2 and Cluster: 25 percent increase * Timing Stage 3 (May and June): 20 percent increase * Both Timing Stage 3 and Cluster: 35 percent increase =Awarding delegates to the candidates= Based on the results of each of the primaries and caucuses, pledged delegates are awarded to the candidates under proportional representation, where candidates who get 15 percent or more of the popular vote in a state divide its delegates in proportion to its votes (those who get under 15 percent of the votes in a state do not get any of its delegates). District delegates are proportionally allocated based on the popular vote in each of their respective districts, and both at-large and pledged PLEO delegates are proportionally allocated based on the statewide vote. Superdelegates A superdelegate is an unpledged delegate to the Democratic National Convention who is seated automatically and chooses for themselves for whom they vote. These superdelegates include elected officials, and party activists and officials. They make up slightly under 15 percent of all convention delegates.Drew DeSilver, Who are the Democratic superdelegates?, Pew Research Center (May 5, 2016). Superdelegates fall into four categories: * Elected members of the Democratic National Committee * Democratic Governors, including territorial governors and the Mayor of the District of Columbia * Democratic Members of Congress, District of Columbia shadow senators and non-voting House members. * Distinguished party leaders (consisting of current and former Presidents, Vice Presidents, congressional leaders, and DNC chairs) Democratic superdelegates are free to support any candidate for the presidential nomination. On August 25, 2018, the Democratic National Committee agreed to reduce the influence of superdelegates by generally preventing them from voting on the first ballot at the Democratic National Convention, allowing their votes only in a contested nomination. Candidate nomination In 1832 and 1844 to 1936, any nomination for president was required to have a majority of two-thirds of the total number of delegates. Unless there was a popular incumbent, something that only happened three times between the Civil War and World War II, getting that many votes on the first ballot was implausible.Herbert Eaton, Presidential timber: A history of nominating conventions, 1868-1960 (1964). The choice was an often contentious debate that riled the passions of party leaders, and delegates were forced to vote for a nominee repeatedly until someone could capture a minimum number of delegates required. This was demonstrated at the conventions of 1852, 1856, 1868, 1912, 1920 and most notoriously 1924, where the voting went on for more than a dozen ballots, while in 1860, the convention deadlocked after 57 ballots, during which 50 Southern delegates walked out, and separate conventions nominated separate Northern and Southern tickets. Backroom deals by party bosses were normal and often resulted in compromise nominees that became known as dark horse candidates, people who never imagined they would run for president until the last moments of the convention. Dark horse candidates were chosen in order to break deadlocks between more popular and powerful prospective nominees that blocked each other from gaining enough delegates to be nominated. One of the most famous dark horse candidates nominated at a Democratic National Convention was James K. Polk, who was chosen to become the candidate for president only after being added to the eighth and ninth delegate ballot. The rules were changed to a simple majority in 1936. Since then, only one multi-ballot convention (in 1952) has taken place. Before 1972, the party's choice of the vice-presidential nominee was usually not known until the last evening of the convention. This was because the presidential nominee had little to do with the process and in many cases was not known at the start of the convention. In 1944 and 1956, the nominee let the convention choose the running mate without a recommendation, leading to multi ballot voting, and other times, successful attempts to sabotage the nominee by scattering delegate votes for someone else besides his choice, as in 1972 and 1980, led to disruptions. In order to prevent such things from happening in the future, the presumptive nominee has, since 1984, announced their choice before the convention even opened, and they have been ratified by voice vote. History Illustration of the 1876 Democratic National Convention in St. Louis, Missouri By 1824, the congressional nominating caucus had fallen into disrepute and collapsed as a method of nominating presidential and vice presidential candidates. A national convention idea had been brought up but nothing occurred until the next decade. State conventions and state legislatures emerged as the nomination apparatus until they were supplanted by the national convention method of nominating candidates. President Andrew Jackson's \\"Kitchen Cabinet\\" privately carried out the plan for the first Democratic National Convention; the public call for the first national convention emanated from Jackson's supporters in New Hampshire in 1831. The first national convention of the Democratic Party began in Baltimore on May 21, 1832. In that year the rule was created, requiring a 2/3 vote to nominate a candidate in order to show the party's unanimous support of Martin Van Buren for vice president. Although this rule was waived in the 1836 and 1840 conventions, in 1844 it was revived by opponents of former President Van Buren, who had the support of a majority (but not two-thirds) of the delegates, in order to prevent him from receiving the nomination. The rule then remained in place until 1936, and on seven occasions this led to Democratic National Conventions which dragged on endlessly, most famously at the 1860 convention, when the convention adjourned in Charleston without making a choice after 57 ballots and reconvened in separate groups six weeks later, and the 1924 convention, when \\"Wets\\" and \\"Drys\\" deadlocked between preferred candidates Alfred E. Smith and William G. McAdoo for 103 ballots over 16 days before finally agreeing on John W. Davis as a compromise candidate. At the 1912 convention, Champ Clark was the first person to receive a majority of the votes who did not go on to achieve a two-thirds vote and the nomination. The 2/3 rule was finally abolished in 1936, when the unanimity in favor of the renomination of President Franklin D. Roosevelt allowed it finally to be put to rest. In the years that followed only one convention (the 1952 Convention) actually went beyond a single ballot. During the time the rule was in force, it virtually assured that no candidate not supported by the South could be nominated. The elimination of the two-thirds rule made it possible for liberal Northern Democrats to gain greater influence in party affairs, leading to the disenfranchisement of Southern Democrats, and defection of many of the latter to the Republican Party, especially during the Civil Rights struggles of the 1960s. William Jennings Bryan delivered his \\"Cross of Gold\\" speech at the 1896 convention. The most historically notable, and tumultuous, convention in recent memory was the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois, which was fraught with highly emotional battles between conventioneers and Vietnam War protesters and an outburst by Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley. Other confrontations between various groups, such as the Yippies and members of the Students for a Democratic Society, and the Chicago police in city parks, streets and hotels marred this convention. Following the 1968 convention, in which many reformers had been disappointed that Vice President Hubert Humphrey, despite not having competed in a single primary, easily won the nomination over Senators Eugene McCarthy and George McGovern (who announced after the assassination of another candidate, Senator Robert F. Kennedy), a commission headed by Senator McGovern reformed the Democratic Party's nominating process to increase the power of primaries in choosing delegates in order to increase the democracy of the process. Not entirely coincidentally, McGovern himself won the nomination in 1972. The 1972 convention was significant in that the new rules put into place as a result of the McGovern commission also opened the door for quotas mandating that certain percentages of delegates be women or members of minority groups, and subjects that were previously deemed not fit for political debate, such as abortion and lesbian and gay rights, now occupied the forefront of political discussion. The nature of Democratic (and Republican) conventions has changed considerably since 1972. Every four years, the nominees are essentially selected earlier and earlier in the year, so the conventions now officially ratify the nominees instead of choose them (even the close race of 2008, which was not decided until early June, did not change the modern function of the convention). The 1980 convention was the last convention for the Democrats that had even a sliver of doubt about who the nominee would be. (Ted Kennedy forced a failing vote to free delegates from their commitment to vote for Jimmy Carter). The 1976 convention was the last where the vice-presidential nominee was announced during the convention, after the presidential nominee was chosen (Carter choosing Walter Mondale). After the \\"ugly\\" conventions of 1968 and 1972, the parties realized it was in their interests to show a unified party to the nation during the convention, and to try to eliminate any dissent. And as the conventions became less interesting, and television ratings have generally declined (as they have on average for all television shows), the networks have cut back their coverage significantly, which in turn has forced the parties to manage what is televised even more closely. Prior to the 2020 convention in Milwaukee (which, due to COVID-19 was moved from the larger Fiserv Forum to the smaller Wisconsin Center), the 1984 convention at the Moscone Center in San Francisco was the last Democratic Convention to be held in a convention center complex; all others since then have been held at sports stadiums or arenas.

Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls (some of them masquerade balls). The parades in New Orleans are organized by social clubs known as krewes; most follow the same parade schedule and route each year. The earliest-established krewes were the Mistick Krewe of Comus, the earliest, Rex, the Knights of Momus and the Krewe of Proteus. Several modern \\"super krewes\\" are well known for holding large parades and events, such as the Krewe of Endymion (which is best known for naming celebrities as grand marshals for their parades), the Krewe of Bacchus (similarly known for naming celebrities as their Kings), as well as the Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club‚Äîa predominantly African American krewe. Float riders traditionally toss throws into the crowds. The most common throws are strings of colorful plastic beads, doubloons, decorated plastic \\"throw cups\\", Moon Pies, and small inexpensive toys, but throws can also include lingerie and more sordid items. Major krewes follow the same parade schedule and route each year. While many tourists center their Carnival season activities on Bourbon Street and in New Orleans and Dauphin, major parades originate in the Uptown and Mid-City districts and follow a route along St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street, on the upriver side of the French Quarter. Mardi Gras day traditionally concludes with the \\"Meeting of the Courts\\" between Rex and Comus.http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/news/elections/11507257-93/comus- brings-carnival-to-glittering Royal Street in the French Quarter, Mardi Gras Day 2019 History Arrival of Rex, monarch of Mardi Gras, as seen on an early 20th-century postcard Rex, presented with freedom of the city; early 20th century postcard Rex in procession down Canal Street; postcard from around 1900 Mardi Gras maskers; circa 1915 postcard The Rex pageant, Mardi Gras Day, New Orleans, La., c. 1907 The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River in what is now lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it as part of an observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is unknown. A 1730 account by Marc-Antione Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including cross-dressing). Excerpt  A Company Man - The Book An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of masks in the streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever such restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned. In 1833 Bernard Xavier de Marigny de Mandeville, a rich plantation owner of French descent, raised money to fund an official Mardi Gras celebration. James R. Creecy in his book Scenes in the South, and Other Miscellaneous Pieces describes New Orleans Mardi Gras in 1835: > Shrove Tuesday is a day to be remembered by strangers in New Orleans, for > that is the day for fun, frolic, and comic masquerading. All of the mischief > of the city is alive and wide awake in active operation.

In 1856 21 businessmen gathered at a club room in the French Quarter to organize a secret society to observe Mardi Gras with a formal parade. They founded New Orleans' first and oldest krewe, the Mystick Krewe of Comus. According to one historian, \\"Comus was aggressively English in its celebration of what New Orleans had always considered a French festival. It is hard to think of a clearer assertion than this parade that the lead in the holiday had passed from French-speakers to Anglo-Americans. ... To a certain extent, Americans 'Americanized' New Orleans and its Creoles. To a certain extent, New Orleans 'creolized' the Americans. Thus the wonder of Anglo-Americans boasting of how their business prowess helped them construct a more elaborate version than was traditional. The lead in organized Carnival passed from Creole to American just as political and economic power did over the course of the nineteenth century. The spectacle of Creole-American Carnival, with Americans using Carnival forms to compete with Creoles in the ballrooms and on the streets, represents the creation of a New Orleans culture neither entirely Creole nor entirely American.\\"All on a Mardi Gras Day: Episodes in the History of New Orleans Carnival by Reid Mitchell. Harvard University Press:1995. pg 25, 26 In 1875 Louisiana declared Mardi Gras a legal state holiday. War, economic, political, and weather conditions sometimes led to cancellation of some or all major parades, especially during the American Civil War, World War I and World War II, but the city has always celebrated Carnival.Sparks, R. American Sodom: New Orleans Faces Its Critics and an Uncertain Future. La Louisiane √† la d√©rive. The √âcole des Hautes √âtudes en Sciences Sociales Coloquio - December 16, 2005. In 1979 the New Orleans police department went on strike. The official parades were canceled or moved to surrounding communities, such as Jefferson Parish, Louisiana. Significantly fewer tourists than usual came to the city. Masking, costuming, and celebrations continued anyway, with National Guard troops maintaining order. Guardsmen prevented crimes against persons or property but made no attempt to enforce laws regulating morality or drug use; for these reasons, some in the French Quarter bohemian community recall 1979 as the city's best Mardi Gras ever. In 1991 the New Orleans City Council passed an ordinance that required social organizations, including Mardi Gras Krewes, to certify publicly that they did not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, gender or sexual orientation, to obtain parade permits and other public licenses. Shortly after the law was passed, the city demanded that these krewes provide them with membership lists, contrary to the long-standing traditions of secrecy and the distinctly private nature of these groups. In protest‚Äîand because the city claimed the parade gave it jurisdiction to demand otherwise-private membership lists‚Äîthe 19th-century krewes Comus and Momus stopped parading. Proteus did parade in the 1992 Carnival season but also suspended its parade for a time, returning to the parade schedule in 2000. Several organizations brought suit against the city, challenging the law as unconstitutional. Two federal courts later declared that the ordinance was an unconstitutional infringement on First Amendment rights of free association, and an unwarranted intrusion on the privacy of the groups subject to the ordinance.The decision of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals appears at volume 42, page 1483 of the Federal Reporter (3rd Series), or 42 F.3d 1483 (5th Cir. 1995). The US Supreme Court refused to hear the city's appeal from this decision. Today, New Orleans krewes operate under a business structure; membership is open to anyone who pays dues, and any member can have a place on a parade float.  Effects of Hurricane Katrina  The devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005 caused a few people to question the future of the city's Mardi Gras celebrations. Mayor Nagin, who was up for reelection in early 2006, tried to play this sentiment for electoral advantage. However, the economics of Carnival were, and are, too important to the city's revival. The city government, essentially bankrupt after Hurricane Katrina, pushed for a scaled back celebration to limit strains on city services. However, many krewes insisted that they wanted to and would be ready to parade, so negotiations between krewe leaders and city officials resulted in a compromise schedule. It was scaled back but less severely than originally suggested. 2006: A Knights of Chaos float satirizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, responsible for the failed levees in New Orleans The 2006 New Orleans Carnival schedule included the Krewe du Vieux on its traditional route through Marigny and the French Quarter on February 11, the Saturday two weekends before Mardi Gras. There were several parades on Saturday, February 18, and Sunday the 19th a week before Mardi Gras. Parades followed daily from Thursday night through Mardi Gras. Other than Krewe du Vieux and two Westbank parades going through Algiers, all New Orleans parades were restricted to the Saint Charles Avenue Uptown to Canal Street route, a section of the city which escaped significant flooding. Some krewes unsuccessfully pushed to parade on their traditional Mid-City route, despite the severe flood damage suffered by that neighborhood. The city restricted how long parades could be on the street and how late at night they could end. National Guard troops assisted with crowd control for the first time since 1979. Louisiana State troopers also assisted, as they have many times in the past. Many floats had been partially submerged in floodwaters for weeks. While some krewes repaired and removed all traces of these effects, others incorporated flood lines and other damage into the designs of the floats. Most of the locals who worked on the floats and rode on them were significantly affected by the storm's aftermath. Many had lost most or all of their possessions, but enthusiasm for Carnival was even more intense as an affirmation of life. The themes of many costumes and floats had more barbed satire than usual, with commentary on the trials and tribulations of living in the devastated city. References included MREs, Katrina refrigerators and FEMA trailers, along with much mocking of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and local and national politicians. By the 2009 season, the Endymion parade had returned to the Mid-City route, and other Krewes expanding their parades Uptown.  2020 tandem float incidents  In 2020, two parade attendees‚Äîone during the Nyx parade, and one during the Endymion parade, were killed after being struck and run over in between interconnected \\"tandem floats\\" towed by a single vehicle. Following the incident during the Nyx parade, there were calls for New Orleans officials to address safety issues with these floats (including outright bans, or requiring the gaps to be filled in using a barrier). Following the second death during the Endymion parade on February 22, 2020 (which caused the parade to be halted and cancelled), city officials announced that tandem floats would be banned effective immediately, with vehicles restricted to one, single float only.  Coronavirus pandemic  Unknown to the participants and local leaders at the time, the 2020 Carnival season (with parades running from January through Mardi Gras Day on February 25) coincided with increasing spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the United States as part of a global pandemic. At the time, the disease was actively being dismissed as a major public health threat by the Trump administration. As such, federal officials did not advise against the holding of Mardi Gras festivities, and scrutiny over mass public gatherings and events that induce international tourism had yet to emerge. The first case of COVID-19 in Louisiana was reported on March 9, two weeks after the end of Mardi Gras. Subsequently, the state of Louisiana saw a significant impact from the pandemic, with New Orleans in particular seeing a high rate of cases. Louisiana State University (LSU) associate professor Susanne Straif-Bourgeoi suggested that the rapid spread may have been aided by Mardi Gras festivities. Researchers of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette estimated that Louisiana had the fastest growth rate of cases (67.8%, overtaking overtaking New York's 66.1% growth) in the 14 days since its first reported case than any region in the world. Mayor LaToya Cantrell stated that she would have cancelled Mardi Gras festivities had she been provided with sufficient warning by the federal government, and criticized the Trump administration for downplaying the threat. Given the progression of the pandemic, it is still undetermined as to whether or not Mardi Gras will take place in 2021. Krewes are hopeful to roll in 2021 but are prepared for 2022 if they are not able to. Traditional colors A flag in the traditional colors, as specified in the Rex organization's original edict. The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are green, gold, and purple. The colors were first specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their inaugural parade in 1872, suggesting that balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some accounts suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true symbolism. Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a theory that the colors were based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and Rex's goal may have been to create a tricolor to represent their \\"kingdom\\". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while white was already heavily used on other national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in that order complies with the rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other colors, and that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors. Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored floats themed around the concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors symbolized justice, power, and faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple, green, and gold, in that order‚Äîeven though this order violates the rule of tincture.  Contemporary Mardi Gras  Float on Magazine Street, 1996 Mounted Krewe Officers in the Thoth Parade, 1998  Epiphany  Epiphany, on January 6, has been recognized as the start of the New Orleans Carnival season since at least 1900; locally, it is sometimes known as Twelfth Night although this term properly refers to Epiphany Eve, January 5, the evening of the twelfth day of Christmastide. The Twelfth Night Revelers, New Orleans' second-oldest Krewe, have staged a parade and masked ball on this date since 1870. A number of other groups such as the Phunny Phorty Phellows, La Soci√©t√© Pas Si Secr√®te Des Champs-√âlys√©es and the Krewe de Jeanne D'Arc have more recently begun to stage events on Epiphany as well. Many of Carnival's oldest societies, such as the Independent Strikers' Society, hold masked balls but no longer parade in public. Mardi Gras season continues through Shrove Tuesday or Fat Tuesday.  Days leading up to Mardi Gras Day  The population of New Orleans more than doubles during the five days before Mardi Gras Day, in anticipation of the biggest celebration. Wednesday night begins with Druids, and is followed by the Mystic Krewe of Nyx, the newest all-female Krewe. Nyx is famous for their highly decorated purses, and has reached Super Krewe status since their founding in 2011. Thursday night starts off with another all-women's parade featuring the Krewe of Muses. The parade is relatively new, but its membership has tripled since its start in 2001. It is popular for its throws (highly sought-after decorated shoes and other trinkets) and themes poking fun at politicians and celebrities. Thursdays are also marked by the great gumbo orgy on Toulouse Street in the French Quarter. This sausage-filled experience began in 1809 and has French-Acadian roots. Friday night is the occasion of the large Krewe of Hermes and satirical Krewe D'√âtat parades, ending with one of the fastest-growing krewes, the Krewe of Morpheus. There are several smaller neighborhood parades like the Krewe of Barkus and the Krewe of OAK. Several daytime parades roll on Saturday (including Krewe of Tucks and Krewe of Isis) and on Sunday (Thoth, Okeanos, and Krewe of Mid-City). The first of the \\"super krewes,\\" Endymion, parades on Saturday night, with the celebrity-led Bacchus parade on Sunday night 1998 Mardi Gras  The celebrations begin early on Mardi Gras, which can fall on any Tuesday between February 3 and March 9 (depending on the date of Easter, and thus of Ash Wednesday). In New Orleans, the Zulu parade rolls first, starting at 8 am on the corner of Jackson and Claiborne and ending at Broad and Orleans, Rex follows Zulu as it turns onto St. Charles following the traditional Uptown route from Napoleon to St. Charles and then to Canal St. Truck parades follow Rex and often have hundreds of floats blowing loud horns, with entire families riding and throwing much more than just the traditional beads and doubloons. Numerous smaller parades and walking clubs also parade around the city. The Jefferson City Buzzards, the Lyons Club, the Irish Channel Corner Club, Pete Fountain's Half Fast Walking Club and the KOE all start early in the day Uptown and make their way to the French Quarter with at least one jazz band. At the other end of the old city, the Society of Saint Anne journeys from the Bywater through Marigny and the French Quarter to meet Rex on Canal Street. The Pair-O-Dice Tumblers rambles from bar to bar in Marigny and the French Quarter from noon to dusk. Various groups of Mardi Gras Indians, divided into uptown and downtown tribes, parade in their finery. For upcoming Mardi Gras Dates through 2050 see Mardi Gras Dates.  Costumes and masks  Bywater neighborhood, 2004 In New Orleans, costumes and masks are seldom publicly worn by non-Krewe members on the days before Fat Tuesday (other than at parties), but are frequently worn on Mardi Gras. Laws against concealing one's identity with a mask are suspended for the day. Banks are closed, and some businesses and other places with security concerns (such as convenience stores) post signs asking people to remove their masks before entering.  Throws  Mardi Gras beads A 'throw' is the collective term used for the objects that are thrown from floats to parade-goers. Until the 1960s, the most common form was multi-colored strings of glass beads made in Czechoslovakia. Glass beads were supplanted by less expensive and more durable plastic beads, first from Hong Kong, then from Taiwan, and more recently from China. Lower-cost beads and toys allow float- riders to purchase greater quantities, and throws have become more numerous and common. In the 1990s, many people lost interest in small, cheap beads, often leaving them where they landed on the ground. Larger, more elaborate metallic beads and strands with figures of animals, people, or other objects have become the sought-after throws. David Redmond's 2005 film of cultural and economic globalization, Mardi Gras: Made in China, follows the production and distribution of beads from a small factory in Fuzhou, China to the streets of New Orleans during Carnival.David Redmon (2008). Mardi Gras: Made in China. Culture Unplugged. Retrieved February 16, 2010. The publication of Redmon's book, Beads, Bodies, and Trash: Public Sex, Global Labor, and the Disposability of Mardi Gras, follows up on the documentary by providing an ethnographic analysis of the social harms, the pleasures, and the consequences of the toxicity that Mardi Gras beads produce. In addition to the toxicity of tons of plastic, eye injuries from Mardi Gras parade throws are commonplace, and more severe injuries‚Äîsuch as a fractured skull in an infant struck by a coconut‚Äîhave also been known to occur. With the advent of the 21st century, more sophisticated throws began to replace simple metallic beads. Krewes started to produce limited edition beads and plush toys that are unique to the krewe. Nowadays yelling the phrase ‚Äúthrow me something mister!‚Äù means you could catch a huge assortment of items with fiber optic beads and LED-powered prizes, medallions, doubloons and soft toys among the most sought-after items. In a retro-inspired twist, glass beads have returned to parades. Now made in India, glass beads are one of the most valuable throws. However, the most commonly associated throws are still strings of plastic beads.  Other Mardi Gras traditions = Social clubs  The Carnival at New Orleans, 1885 New Orleans Social clubs play a very large part in the Mardi Gras celebration as hosts of many of the parades on or around Mardi Gras. The two main Mardi Gras parades, Zulu and Rex, are both social club parades. Zulu is a mostly African- American club and Rex is mostly Caucasian. Social clubs host Mardi Gras balls, starting in late January. At these social balls, the queen of the parade (usually a young woman between the ages of 18 and 21, not married and in high school or college) and the king (an older male member of the club) present themselves and their court of maids (young women aged 16 to 21), and different divisions of younger children with small roles in the ball and parade, such as a theme-beformal neighborhood Carnival club ball at local bar room. In response to their exclusion from Rex, in 1909 Cr√©ole and black New Orleanians, led by a mutual aid group known as \\"The Tramps\\", adorned William Storey with a tin can crown and banana stalk scepter and named him King Zulu.Three centuries of Mardi Gras history. From: carnaval.com. Retrieved October 19, 2007.Mardi Gras History. From: mardigrasneworleans.com. Retrieved October 19, 2007. This display was meant as a mockery of Rex's overstated pageantry, but in time, Zulu became a grand parade in its own right. By 1949, as an indication of Zulu's increase in prestige, the krewe named New Orleans' native son Louis Armstrong as its king. Being a member of the court requires much preparation, usually months ahead. Women and girls must have dress fittings as early as the May before the parade, as the season of social balls allows little time between each parade. These balls are generally by invitation only. Balls are held at a variety of venues in the city, large and small, depending on the size and budget of the organization. In the late 19th and early 20th century, the French Opera House was a leading venue for New Orleans balls. From the mid 20th century until Hurricane Katrina the Municipal Auditorim was the city's most famous site for Carnival balls. In more recent years, most are at the ballrooms of various hotels throughout the city. The largest \\"Super Krewes\\" use larger venues; Bacchus the Morial Convention Center and Endymion the Superdome.  Doubloons  One of the many Mardi Gras throws which krewes fling into the crowds, doubloons are large coins, either wood or metal, made in Mardi Gras colors. Artist H. Alvin Sharpe created the modern doubloon for The School of Design (the actual name of the Rex organization). According to the krewe history, in January 1959 Sharpe arrived at the offices of the captain of the krewe with a handful of aluminum discs. Upon entering the office, he threw the doubloons into the captain's face to prove that they would be safe to throw from the floats. Standard krewe doubloons usually portray the Krewe's emblem, name, and founding date on one side, and the theme and year of the parade and ball on the other side. Royalty and members of the court may throw specialty doubloons, such as the special Riding Lieutenant doubloons given out by men on horseback in the Rex parade. In the last decade, krewes have minted doubloons specific to each float. Krewes also mint special doubloons of cloisonn√© or pure silver for its members. They never throw these from the floats. Original Rex doubloons are valuable, but it is nearly impossible for aficionados to find a certified original doubloon. The School of Design did not begin dating their doubloons until a few years after their introduction. Carriers with lit flambeaux on Napoleon Avenue, just before the start of a parade, 2007  Flambeau carriers  The flambeau (\\"flahm-bo\\" meaning flame-torch) carrier originally, before electric lighting, served as a beacon for New Orleans parade goers to better enjoy the spectacle of night parades. The first flambeau carriers were slaves. Today, the flambeaux are a connection to the New Orleans version of Carnival and a valued contribution. Many people view flambeau-carrying as a kind of performance art - a valid assessment given the wild gyrations and flourishes displayed by experienced flambeau carriers in a parade. Many individuals are descended from a long line of carriers. Parades that commonly feature flambeaux include Babylon, Bacchus, Chaos, Le Krewe d'Etat, Druids, Endymion, Hermes, Krewe of Muses, Krewe of Orpheus, Krewe of Proteus, Saturn, and Sparta. Flambeaux are powered by naphtha, a highly flammable aromatic. It is a tradition, when the flambeau carriers pass by during a parade, to toss quarters to them in thanks for carrying the lights of Carnival. In the 21st century, though, handing dollar bills is common. Rex Each year in New Orleans, krewes are responsible for electing Rex, the king of the carnival. The Rex Organization was formed to create a daytime parade for the residents of the city. The Rex motto is, \\"Pro Bono Publico‚Äîfor the public good.\\"  Mardi Gras icons  * Faces of Comedy and Tragedy * Feathered masks * \\"Laissez les bons temps rouler!\\" (French: \\"Let the good times roll!\\") * \\"Throw me something, Mister!\\" Revelers on Basin Street examine their parade catches, including a Zulu Coconut, 2009  New Orleans Zulu or Mardi Gras Coconut  One of the most famous and the most sought after throws, is the Zulu Coconut also known as the Golden Nugget and the Mardi Gras Coconut.Deja Krewe. The Times-Picayune. Retrieved October 19, 2007. The coconut is mentioned as far back as 1910, where they were given in a natural \\"hairy\\" state. The coconut was thrown as a cheap alternative, especially in 1910 when the bead throws were made of glass. Before the Krewe of Zulu threw coconuts, they threw walnuts that were painted gold. This is where the name \\"Golden Nugget\\" originally came from. It is thought that Zulu switched from walnuts to coconuts in the early 1920s when a local painter, Lloyd Lucus, started to paint coconuts. Most of the coconuts have two decorations. The first is painted gold with added glitter, and the second is painted like the famous black Zulu faces. In 1988, the city forbade Zulu from throwing coconuts due to the risk of injury; they are now handed to onlookers rather than thrown. In the year 2000, a local electronics engineer, Willie Clark, introduced an upgraded version of the classic, naming them Mardi Gras Coconuts. These new coconuts were first used by the club in 2002, giving the souvenirs to royalty and city notables. Ojen liqueur Aguardiente de Oj√©n (es), or simply \\"ojen\\" (\\"OH-hen\\") as it is known in English, is a Spanish anisette traditionally consumed during the New Orleans Mardi Gras festivities.

The practice of exposing female breasts in exchange for Mardi Gras beads, however, was mostly limited to tourists in the upper Bourbon Street area. In the crowded streets of the French Quarter, generally avoided by locals on Mardi Gras Day, flashers on balconies cause crowds to form on the streets. In the last decades of the 20th century, the rise in producing commercial videotapes catering to voyeurs helped encourage a tradition of women baring their breasts in exchange for beads and trinkets. Social scientists studying \\"ritual disrobement\\" found, at Mardi Gras 1991, 1,200 instances of body-baring in exchange for beads or other favors.Shrum, W. and J.

The sequences can be either of genomic, \\"transcriptomic\\" (ESTs) or protein origin. For proteins, homologous sequences are typically grouped into families. For EST data, clustering is important to group sequences originating from the same gene before the ESTs are assembled to reconstruct the original mRNA. Some clustering algorithms use single- linkage clustering, constructing a transitive closure of sequences with a similarity over a particular threshold. UCLUST and CD-HIT use a greedy algorithm that identifies a representative sequence for each cluster and assigns a new sequence to that cluster if it is sufficiently similar to the representative; if a sequence is not matched then it becomes the representative sequence for a new cluster. The similarity score is often based on sequence alignment. Sequence clustering is often used to make a non- redundant set of representative sequences. Sequence clusters are often synonymous with (but not identical to) protein families. Determining a representative tertiary structure for each sequence cluster is the aim of many structural genomics initiatives.

Close up of a sheltopusik in a zoo in Japan (video). The sheltopusikAlso spelled scheltopusik, sheltopusick, scheltopusick, sheltopusic, or scheltopusic. (Pseudopus apodus), also commonly called Pallas's glass lizardBeolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Pseudopus apodus, p. 199). or the European legless lizard, is a species of large glass lizard found from Southern Europe to Central Asia. Etymology Pseudopus apodus comes from greek œàŒµœÖŒ¥ŒøœÄŒøŒ¥ŒøœÇ Œ¨œÄŒøŒ¥ŒøœÇ, literally meaning fakeleged without legs. The common name \\"sheltopusik\\" comes from Russian –∂–µ–ª—Ç–æ–ø—É–∑–∏–∫ (zheltopuzik), literally \\"yellow- bellied\\". Taxonomy The sheltopusik was previously included in the genus Ophisaurus, but has been placed in its own genus Pseudopus. It was originally described in 1775 by Peter Simon Pallas as Lacerta apoda.Lacerta apoda. Peter Simon Pallas. Published: 1775. Description The sheltopusik can reach a length of . It is tan colored, paler on the ventral surface and the head, with a ring-like/segmented appearance that makes it look like a giant earthworm with a distinctive fold of skin down each side called a lateral groove. Small (2-mm) rear legs are sometimes visible near the cloaca. Though the legs are barely discernible, the sheltopusik can be quickly distinguished from a snake by its ears, eyelids, and ventral scales. Habitat and behaviour P. apodus inhabits open country, such as short grassland or sparsely wooded hills. It consumes arthropods and small mammals. Snails and slugs appear to be its favorite prey, which may explain why it is particularly active in wet weather, although it prefers a dry habitat. Defensive behaviour Due to its size, the sheltopusik tends to respond to harassment by hissing, biting, and musking. It is less likely to drop off its tail than some other species that display caudal autotomy. However, these occasional displays of caudal autotomy are responsible for the name \\"glass lizard\\" (or \\"glass snake\\"). The released tail may break into pieces, leading to the myth that the lizard can shatter like glass and reassemble itself later. In reality, if the tail is lost, it grows back slowly, but is shorter and darker; it may grow back to full length as it grows. Sheltopusik Dolichophis jugularis preying on a sheltopusik In captivity Sheltopusiks are frequently available in the exotic pet trade, though rarely captive-bred. They do not typically tolerate a large amount of handling, but they adapt to captivity well, feeding on crickets, meal worms, small mice, eggs, snails, or pieces of meat which they even accept from a keeper's tweezers, or even from the hands once they become used to captivity. However, they do get excited around food and have surprisingly powerful jaws. They make hardy captives, capable of living up to 50 years. Reproduction About 10 weeks after mating, the female P. apodus lays about eight eggs, which she hides under bark or a stone, and often guards them. The young hatch after 45 to 55 days. They are typically about long and usually start to eat after four days. See also *List of reptiles of Italy ReferencesExternal links  * * Further reading *Arnold EN, Burton JA (1978).

He is a member of the American Football League (AFL) All-Time Team, and was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979. Mix attended the University of Southern California, where he was an All American. Upon graduation, he played right tackle and guard for the AFL's Los Angeles/San Diego Chargers (1960‚Äì69) and the National Football League (NFL) Oakland Raiders (1971). An eight-time AFL All-Star (1961‚Äì68) and a nine-time All-AFL (1960‚Äì68) selection, he is also a member of the Los Angeles Chargers Hall of Fame.  Early and personal life  Mix was born in Los Angeles, California, grew up in its Boyle Heights neighborhood, and is Jewish.How Three Jews Behind the AFL Invented the Modern Media Spectacle That is Pro Football Today ‚Äì Tablet MagazineRon Mix Stats  Pro- Football-Reference.comJewish Sports Stars (2nd Revised Edition): Athletic Heroes Past and Present ‚Äì David J. Goldman ‚Äì Google Books He attended Hawthorne High School in Hawthorne, California. Mix, who was listed at 6' 5\\" and 270 pounds, was an early proponent of weightlifting to enhance athletic power. He was years ahead of the curve that soon saw lineman and other football players taking up that practice to become better athletes. His lifts included a military press of 300 pounds, a clean and jerk of 325 pounds, and a bench press of 425 pounds, all of the lifts considered to be exceptionally strong for that era of play. Mix went to the University of San Diego Law School in the off-season and earned a Juris Doctor degree in 1971.The Long Trial of Ron Mix  San Diego Reader He was nicknamed \\"The Intellectual Assassin\\" for his combination of intellectual excellence with his style of physical play.  College career  Mix attended the University of Southern California (USC) on a football scholarship. There in 1959 he was a First Team All American, AP First Team All-Pacific Coast, First Team All Big Five, and won the USC Lineman Award. He was a member of the Delta Chi fraternity. At USC he minored in English, during his career Mix wrote a number of articles for Sports Illustrated. He was elected the National Jewish College Athlete of the Year.Happy Hanukkah: The Greatest Jewish Sports Stars of All Time  Bleacher Report  Latest News, Videos and Highlights  Professional football career  He was an original Los Angeles Charger in 1960. Although the Baltimore Colts picked him number 1 in 1960, he chose to go to the AFL, where he had also been the number 1 draft pick. He was a factor in the Chargers' early domination of the AFL's Western Division, and in San Diego helped them win an American Football League Championship in 1963, when they defeated the Boston Patriots 51-10 in the championship game. Mix was called for a mere two holding penalties in ten years. Mix was the first white player in the 1965 AFL All- Star game in New Orleans to step forward and join his black teammates in a civil rights boycott. The racist environment of New Orleans caused the black players to say they weren't playing in a city that denied them the most basic rights (to eat, to get a cab, etc.). He made it clear that if the black players were not going to play, neither would he. That caused other white players to join the boycott. The game was then moved to Houston. He was elected to the AFL All-Star team for eight straight years as a Charger, was a nine-time All-AFL selection, is a member of the All-time All-AFL Team, and is one of only 20 men who played the entire 10 years of the AFL.Oakland Raiders  Raiders in the Hall of Fame ‚Äì Ron Mix He was the first Charger to have his number retired in 1969 after he announced he was quitting football after playing injured that season. He earned a J.D. degree from the University of San Diego School of Law in 1970. He told the Chargers he wanted to play again, but they had found a replacement in Gene Ferguson. After Mix asked to be traded to the New York Jets, San Diego traded him to the Oakland Raiders for two high draft picks in 1970 and 1971. The deal was contingent upon Mix unretiring and agreeing to play for Oakland. He played with the Raiders in 1971. Then-Chargers owner Eugene V. Klein, who hated the Raiders, unretired Mix's number. He was also the general manager of the WFL Portland Storm in 1974.

Lance Alworth was the first in 1978.  After football  Mix practiced law in San Diego, California with a practice focused on representing retired professional athletes in claims for workers' compensation benefits. Prior to that, he was a civil litigator. In 2016, the IRS accused Mix of filing a false tax return. Federal prosecutors said that Mix got referrals for clients from a non-lawyer, a former professional basketball player client of his named Kermit Washington and that Mix made contributions to two charitable foundations run by Washington that supported a school and other causes in Africa. Mix took tax deductions for the contributions. Court records alleged that Washington diverted most of money donated to his charities for his own personal use. Mix pled guilty to one count of filing a false tax return. The plea agreement specifically said that Mix believed the charity was legitimate and did not know the funds were being diverted. Nonetheless, claiming the charitable contributions was wrong because Mix got something of value‚Äîthe referrals.San Diego Union Tribune, May 23, 2016. US District Judge Greg Kays imposed a time- served sentence (less than probation). On February 24, 2019, Mix was permanently disbarred.http://members.calbar.ca.gov/fal/Licensee/Detail/49663http://members.calbar.ca.gov/courtDocs/16-C-13639-3.pdf  See also  * List of American Football League players * List of select Jewish football players  References  External links  * Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:People from Boyle Heights, Los Angeles Category:Sportspeople from Los Angeles Category:Players of American football from California Category:Jewish American football people Category:American football offensive guards Category:American football offensive tackles Category:USC Trojans football players Category:Los Angeles Chargers players Category:San Diego Chargers players Category:Oakland Raiders players Category:American Football League players Category:American Football League All-Star players Category:American Football League champions Category:American Football League All-Time Team Category:Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:United States Football League announcers Category:California lawyers Category:People convicted of tax crimes ","title":"Ron Mix"},{"id":"468126","text":"is a town located in Kamimashiki District, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan.

Nishiki is served by the Higo-Nishinomura Station of the Kumagawa Railroad Yunomae Line.  Flag  The current town flag was adopted in 1956, however there is no formal flag law codifying this.Nishiki Town (Kumamoto prefecture, Japan) Èå¶Áî∫ ‚Äì Flags of the World The flag is green with a town emblem in the center. The emblem is a stylized katakana „ÉãNi of Nishiki. The circle \\"symbolizes a reconciliation and the mountain, the river and the sun do the town located in the center of Kuma Basin which is expanding to the future\\". Geography Nishiki is located in the southern part of Kumamoto prefecture. 70 kilometers (43.5 miles) South-southeast of the town is the prefectural capital. The northern portion of the town lies in flat terrain that forms part of the Hitoyoshi Basin; the Kuma River borders the town to the East and West. The southern reaches of the Kuju mountain range (‰πùÈáçÂ±±, Kuj≈´san) adjoins one corner of the town limits. The southernmost corner of the townsland meets the prefectural border with Miyazaki Prefecture.  Economy  The town's economy is primarily based around agriculture (primarily pear, peach and rice cultivation) and leisure tourism activities such as golf holidays, though the Nishiki plant of Renesas Semiconductor (formerly NEC Kumamoto) is also a major contributor. The Nishiki plant specializes in LSI manufacturing. The total economic output of Nishiki for fiscal year 2004 was ¬•40.7 billion yen.  World War II  During the closing years of the Second World War, a major base of the Imperial Japanese Navy's Hitoyoshi Naval Air Group was located near the town. Relatively little is currently known about the base and its operations due to a loss of records and institutional memory both during and after the war. The remains of the base extend over of land, and houses underground facilities in more than 10 locations, including an operations room and a large torpedo preparation area. In 2015, a full archeological survey of the site was initiated by the municipal government via the Nishiki board of education to discover more about the base and its past, with a view to eventually opening it up to tourism. This followed the discovery by the local government of a copy of a floor plan for the base.

A protein family is a group of evolutionarily-related proteins. In many cases a protein family has a corresponding gene family, in which each gene encodes a corresponding protein with a 1:1 relationship. The term protein family should not be confused with family as it is used in taxonomy. Proteins in a family descend from a common ancestor and typically have similar three-dimensional structures, functions, and significant sequence similarity. The most important of these is sequence similarity (usually amino acid sequence) since it is the strictest indicator of homology and therefore the clearest indicator of common ancestry. There is a fairly well developed framework for evaluating the significance of similarity between a group of sequences using sequence alignment methods. Proteins that do not share a common ancestor are very unlikely to show statistically significant sequence similarity, making sequence alignment a powerful tool for identifying the members of protein families. Families are sometimes grouped together into larger clades called superfamilies based on structural and mechanistic similarity, even if there is no identifiable sequence homology. Currently, over 60,000 protein families have been defined, although ambiguity in the definition of protein family leads different researchers to wildly varying numbers. Terminology and usage As with many biological terms, the use of protein family is somewhat context dependent; it may indicate large groups of proteins with the lowest possible level of detectable sequence similarity, or very narrow groups of proteins with almost identical sequence, function, and three-dimensional structure, or any kind of group in-between. To distinguish between these situations, the term protein superfamily is often used for distantly related proteins whose relatedness is not detectable by sequence similarity, but only from shared structural features. Other terms such as protein class, group, clan and sub-family have been coined over the years, but all suffer similar ambiguities of usage. A common usage is that superfamilies (structural homology) contain families (sequence homology) which contain sub-families. Hence a superfamily, such as the PA clan of proteases, has far lower sequence conservation than one of the families it contains, the C04 family. It is unlikely that an exact definition will be agreed and to it is up to the reader to discern exactly how these terms are being used in a particular context. . Protein domains and motifs The concept of protein family was conceived at a time when very few protein structures or sequences were known; at that time, primarily small, single- domain proteins such as myoglobin, hemoglobin, and cytochrome c were structurally understood. Since that time, it was found that many proteins comprise multiple independent structural and functional units or domains. Due to evolutionary shuffling, different domains in a protein have evolved independently. This has led, in recent years, to a focus on families of protein domains. A number of online resources are devoted to identifying and cataloging such domains (see list of links at the end of this article). Regions of each protein have differing functional constraints (features critical to the structure and function of the protein). For example, the active site of an enzyme requires certain amino acid residues to be precisely oriented in three dimensions. On the other hand, a protein‚Äìprotein binding interface may consist of a large surface with constraints on the hydrophobicity or polarity of the amino acid residues. Functionally constrained regions of proteins evolve more slowly than unconstrained regions such as surface loops, giving rise to discernible blocks of conserved sequence when the sequences of a protein family are compared (see multiple sequence alignment). These blocks are most commonly referred to as motifs, although many other terms are used (blocks, signatures, fingerprints, etc.). Again, many online resources are devoted to identifying and cataloging protein motifs (see list at end of article). Evolution of protein families According to current consensus, protein families arise in two ways. Firstly, the separation of a parent species into two genetically isolated descendent species allows a gene/protein to independently accumulate variations (mutations) in these two lineages. This results in a family of orthologous proteins, usually with conserved sequence motifs. Secondly, a gene duplication may create a second copy of a gene (termed a paralog). Because the original gene is still able to perform its function, the duplicated gene is free to diverge and may acquire new functions (by random mutation). Certain gene/protein families, especially in eukaryotes, undergo extreme expansions and contractions in the course of evolution, sometimes in concert with whole genome duplications. This expansion and contraction of protein families is one of the salient features of genome evolution, but its importance and ramifications are currently unclear. Phylogenetic tree of RAS superfamily. Tree was created using FigTree (Free online software). Use and importance of protein families As the total number of sequenced proteins increases and interest expands in proteome analysis, there is an ongoing effort to organize proteins into families and to describe their component domains and motifs. Reliable identification of protein families is critical to phylogenetic analysis, functional annotation, and the exploration of diversity of protein function in a given phylogenetic branch. The Enzyme Function Initiative (EFI) is using protein families and superfamilies as the basis for development of a sequence/structure-based strategy for large scale functional assignment of enzymes of unknown function. The algorithmic means for establishing protein families on a large scale are based on a notion of similarity. Most of the time the only similarity we have access to is sequence similarity. Protein family resources There are many biological databases that record examples of protein families and allow users to identify if newly identified proteins belong to a known family. Here are a few examples: *Pfam - Protein families database of alignments and HMMs *PROSITE - Database of protein domains, families and functional sites *PIRSF - SuperFamily Classification System * PASS2 - Protein Alignment as Structural Superfamilies v2 - PASS2@NCBS *SUPERFAMILY - Library of HMMs representing superfamilies and database of (superfamily and family) annotations for all completely sequenced organisms * SCOP and CATH - classifications of protein structures into superfamilies, families and domains Similarly many database- searching algorithms exist, for example: *BLAST - DNA sequence similarity search *BLASTp - Protein sequence similarity search * OrthoFinder: a fast, scalable and accurate method for clustering proteins into families (orthogroups) See also *Gene family *Protein superfamily *Protein subfamily *Protein structure *Protein domains *Sequence alignment *Sequence clustering *Genome annotation Protein families=ReferencesExternal links * Category:Bioinformatics Category:Protein classification * ","title":"Protein family"},{"id":"468155","text":"is a village located in Kuma District, Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan.

Harrowby was Member of Parliament (MP) for Lichfield from 1856 to 1859 and for Liverpool from 1868 until he succeeded to the peerage in 1882. He gained experience of affairs as private secretary to Henry Labouchere at the colonial office. He was a member of the select committees on the Hudson's Bay Company (1857) and the Euphrates Valley (1871‚Äì72), and continued throughout life to devote much time and attention to the study of imperial and colonial questions. He was Vice-President of the Committee on Education from 1874 to 1878, and President of the Board of Trade (with a seat in the cabinet) from 1878 to 1880 in Benjamin Disraeli's second administration and was sworn of the Privy Council in 1874. Between 1885 and 1886, he served as Lord Privy Seal in Lord Salisbury's first government. Apart from his career in national politics he was also Chairman of the Staffordshire county council and a Deputy Lieutenant and Justice of the Peace for that county. He died at Sandon Hall, Staffordshire, on 26 March 1900. Family Lord Harrowby married Lady Mary Cecil, daughter of Brownlow Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Exeter, in 1861. The marriage was childless. Harrowby died in March 1900, aged 69, and was succeeded by his younger brother, Henry. Lady Harrowby died in July 1917.

The hill gets its name from the ancient box woodland found on the steepest west-facing chalk slopes overlooking the River Mole. The western part of the hill is owned and managed by the National Trust, whilst the village of Box Hill lies on higher ground to the east. The highest point is Betchworth Clump at above OD, although the Salomons Memorial (at 172 metres) overlooking the town of Dorking is the most popular viewpoint. Box Hill lies within the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and forms part of the Mole Gap to Reigate Escarpment Site of Special Scientific Interest. The north- and south-facing slopes support an area of chalk downland, noted for its orchids and other rare plant species. The hill provides a habitat for 38 species of butterfly, and has given its name to a species of squash bug, now found throughout south-east England. An estimated 850,000 people visit Box Hill each year. The National Trust visitors' centre provides both a cafeteria and gift shop, and panoramic views of the western Weald may be enjoyed from the North Downs Way, a long-distance footpath that runs along the south-facing scarp slope. Box Hill featured prominently on the route of the 2012 Summer Olympics cycling road race events. Geography St Andrew's Church, Box Hill village. Box Hill, approximately south-west of central London, stands at the south- eastern corner of the Mole Gap, the valley carved by the River Mole through the North Downs. Its summit, above Ordnance Datum, is the 12th highest in Surrey.Database of British and Irish Hills Retrieved 6 March 2015 The western boundary of the hill is defined by the River Mole, which has cut a steep cliff, exposing the chalk bedrock. The Vale of Holmesdale lies immediately to the south, below the scarp slope. The northern and eastern boundaries are defined by dry river valleys, which were created during the last Ice Age. The total area of the hill is approximately , of which half is owned by the National Trust. The village of Box Hill is within the civil parish of Headley. The earliest flint cottages date from the 1800s, although much of the village was constructed in the first half of the 20th century. By 2005 there were more than 800 dwellings, of which over five hundred were mobile homes. An estimated 41% of the community is aged 60 or over. St Andrew's Church, part of the ecclesiastical parish of Headley, was consecrated in 1969 and the village hall opened in 1974. History=Early history pollarded beech tree between the Viewpoint and the Donkey Green. Two Bronze Age round barrows, located close to the Salomons Memorial, provide the earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on Box Hill. The larger barrow is in diameter and high and, in medieval times, was used as a boundary marker or mere for the parish of Mickleham. Traces of prehistoric field boundaries are visible on Burford Spur and the low flint banks on the steeper and more wooded White Hill may be contemporaneous. An ancient trackway along the North Downs escarpment can be dated to around 600‚Äì450 BC, but has probably been in existence since the Stone Age and may have crossed the River Mole at a ford close to the location of the present day stepping stones. In Victorian times this route was dubbed the Pilgrims' Way and was supposedly followed by visitors to the shrines of Thomas Becket and Swithun at Canterbury and Winchester respectively. Stane Street was constructed by the Romans in around 60‚Äì70 AD to link London (Londinium) to Chichester (Noviomagus Reginorum) on the south coast of England. The course of the road runs in a southwesterly direction across Mickleham Downs, before turning south to cross the River Mole at a ford close to the site of the Burford Bridge Hotel. A hoard of nine Roman coins, including bronze folles dating from the reigns of Diocletian, Maximian and Constantius I, was discovered close to Broadwood's Folly in 1979. Medieval and early modern periods The pillow mounds to the north-east of the Salomons Memorial are thought to date from the medieval period and were probably constructed as artificial warrens for rabbits. High Ashurst warren is recorded as remaining in use until the late 18th century. A second warren was probably situated close to Warren Farm in the Headley Valley and it has been speculated that the present farmhouse was originally the warrener's cottage. Box and yew trees growing on the steep, western slope of Box Hill, above the River Mole. The origin of the box trees growing on the hill is disputed. Several sources from the late 18th century suggest that they were planted by Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel during the reign of Charles I. However Howard never owned the Box Hill estate and older medieval documents make reference to local individuals with surnames including Atteboxe, de la Boxe and Buxeto, suggesting that the trees were already common in the area by the 13th century. The diarist John Evelyn records a visit to the hill in August 1655 to view \\"those natural bowers, cabinets and shady walks in the box copses.\\" The close grain of the box wood made it highly prized for its timber for carving and there are numerous accounts of the sale of trees from the hill throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. At the end of the eighteenth century, imports from Portugal reduced the market value of box wood and commercial exploitation of timber from Box Hill appears to have ended with a final sale in 1797. Agriculture Despite the commercial importance of timber in the early modern period, the woodland on Box Hill was much less extensive at the start of the 19th century than at the start of the 21st. The 1801 Betchworth Estate Map shows that there was a network of irregularly shaped fields on the top of the hill, where the more fertile clay-with-flints overlays the chalk. These ‚Äòclearings‚Äô (each up to ) were cultivated for arable crops, but by the 1830s changes in farming practices meant that they were too small to be worked economically and many were over-planted with beech (with some oak). These deciduous plantations may be distinguished from older yew- and box-dominated woodland on the hill by the uniform age of the trees. Remnants of a few of these arable fields still exist, notably at the head of Juniper Bottom and around the old Box Hill Fort and Swiss Cottage. The Donkey Green (immediately north of the Salomons Memorial) was used as a cricket ground in the 1850s. It acquired its current name in Edwardian times, when donkey rides were offered to younger day trippers, although this practice had ceased by World War II. The soil covering the north- and south-facing chalk slopes is too thin and insufficiently fertile to allow cultivation. These areas are indicated as sheep-walk on the 1801 map and were used as pasture, especially during the winter months when lower ground was too wet for productive grazing. Grazing of these slopes has continued into the 21st century and a herd of Belted Galloway cattle is used by both Surrey Wildlife Trust and the National Trust to control growth of grasses, which allows wild flowers including orchids to flourish. Common gorse in bloom on Headley Heath. Throughout its history, Headley Heath has been used for grazing and local villagers have collected heather, gorse and turf for bedding and making fires. Although most Rights of Common connected with the heath were abolished by Act of Parliament in 1965, the inhabitants of one nearby cottage still have the right to graze geese. Ownership and public access The hill was purchased by Thomas Hope, shortly before his death in 1831. (Hope was the owner of The Deepdene, the mansion to the east of Dorking.) The Mickleham Parish Records credit Hope's widow, Louisa de la Poer Beresford (whom he had married six years previously), with allowing \\"free access to the beauties of this hill\\", however day-trippers had been arriving in significant numbers for more than a century before that. Developments in local transport infrastructure over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, enabled increasing numbers to visit the area. Following the completion of the turnpike road between Leatherhead and Dorking in 1750, stagecoaches stopped regularly at the Burford Bridge Hotel. As late as 1879, a daily coach ran non-stop to Box Hill from Piccadilly with a journey time of 2.5 hours. The South Eastern Railway opened the first railway station in Dorking in 1849, followed by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR), which opened the station in the village of Westhumble in 1867. The LBSCR ran dedicated excursion trains to Box Hill on Bank Holiday weekends and over 1300 day-trippers were recorded arriving at Westhumble station on 6 August 1883. The Salomons Memorial commemorates the gift of of land on Box Hill to the National Trust in 1914. The proposals for a land value tax outlined by Chancellor David Lloyd George in his People's Budget of 1909 prompted the trustees of the Deepdene estate to start to sell the unimproved land on the western side of Box Hill. As a result of negotiations led by Sir Robert Hunter, Leopold Salomons of Norbury Park purchased of Box Hill in 1913 for ¬£16,000. The following year, Salomons donated the land, which included the Old Fort, Swiss Cottage and the western flank of the hill above the River Mole, to the National Trust. Two further purchases of and transferred Lodge Hill and Ashurst Rough to National Trust ownership in 1921 and 1923. Following World War II, National Trust acquired Headley Heath, a geologically distinct area of heathland which lies to the north-east of Box Hill village, the majority of which was given as a single donation in 1946. The Trust continued to purchase land, and by the mid-1980s the estate comprised some . The most recent additions to the Box Hill Estate include farmland at Westhumble and at the foot of the hill, purchased in the late 1990s. Military History blast bank (left) which protects the south west face of the flat-roofed main building (right). In the latter half of the 19th century, growing public concern over the ability of the British armed forces to repel an invasion (stoked, in part, by the serialisation of George Tomkyns Chesney's 1871 novella The Battle of Dorking), prompted the government to announce the construction of thirteen fortified mobilisation centres, collectively known as the London Defence Positions. Two centres were built on Box Hill, approximately apart: one close to the present National Trust visitor centre (commonly called Box Hill Fort) and the other close to the summit of the hill, to the south of the present day Box Hill village (known as Betchworth Fort). The sites were purchased from the trustees of the Hope estate by the Ministry of Defence in 1891, and construction began in 1899. The two centres were laid out in the form of an infantry redoubt typical of the period, but also included magazines (partially below ground level) for the storage of shells and cartridges. (In common with the majority of the eleven other mobilisation centres, the forts were designed for the use of the infantry only and the stored ammunition was intended for the use of mobile field artillery which would be deployed nearby as required.) The main flat-roofed buildings were built in brick and reinforced concrete and were protected from artillery fire by crescent-shaped earth blast banks, surrounded by an outer ditch. A reform of defence policy by the Secretary of War Viscount Haldane in 1905 resulted in all 13 centres being declared redundant, and both forts were sold back to the estate trustees in 1908. Both forts are protected by a Scheduled Monument listing. The National Trust owns the Box Hill Fort and a metal grill has been placed over the entrance to allow bats to access to their roosts. The Betchworth Fort is in private ownership and is not accessible to the public. Pillbox on the south-facing scarp slope of Box Hill (to the north of Betchworth Castle). During the World War II, the River Mole comprised part of the fortified GHQ Line B. This defensive line ran along the North Downs from Farnham via Guildford to Dorking, before following the river to Horley. Between Betchworth and Box Hill, the north bank of the River Mole was stabilised and made steeper to prevent wheeled vehicles from crossing. At Boxhill Farm, where access to the river from the north bank was required for the herd of dairy cows, a row of twelve concrete cylinders were cast as an anti-tank measure. Gun mounts were also installed to protect both Boxhill and Deepdene bridges and several pillboxes were constructed. The Stepping Stones at the foot of the hill were removed as an anti-invasion measure. From 1940, Headley Court was used as the Headquarters for the VII Corps and later for the Canadian Corps and Canadian troops were billeted at High Ashurst. Bellasis House was used as training centre both for Czech agents of the Special Operations Executive and for German Prisoners of War. In preparation for D-Day, Headley Heath was used for tank and combat training by the Canadian armed forces, and the area known as The Pyramids is named after the piles of ammunition that they kept on the heath. Betchworth Quarry was used by the British Army in early 1944, to test the firing capabilities of Churchill tanks. Geology=Rock types The exposed chalk workings of the former Betchworth Quarry on the south-facing scarp slope of Box Hill. The chalk which comprises the majority of Box Hill (and the rest of the North Downs), has its origins in the late Cretaceous (approximately 100 ‚Äì 66 million years ago). For the entirety of this period, south east England was covered by a warm, shallow sea in which coccolithophores, single-celled algae with small calcite skeletons, thrived. As the phytoplankton died, their calcium-rich shells were deposited on the sea bed and, over time, formed the chalk we know today. Overlying the chalk across much of the higher ground on the hill, is a deposit of clay-with-flints. Although the origins of this layer are uncertain, the clay is thought to have been formed during several periods of glaciation and was produced by cryoturbation and decalcification of the chalk. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of flint, which is also found in the underlying strata. The sandy deposits on Headley Heath have their origin in the Quaternary. The sand and gravels found in this area, indicate the presence of the sea shore. On Headley Heath, these deposits are thin and the chalk also comes to the surface in several places, allowing acid-loving plants to thrive alongside those that prefer alkaline conditions, producing the rare chalk heath habitat. Wealden uplift and erosion of the North Downs escarpment Simplified geological cross section of the western Weald, showing how the land was uplifted to form the Weald-Artois anticline (dashed lines) and the strata as they are today (solid lines). Following the Cretaceous, the sea covering the south of England began to retreat and the land was pushed higher. The Weald (the area covering modern day south Surrey, south Kent and north Sussex) was lifted by the same geological processes that created the Alps, resulting in an anticline which stretched across the English Channel to the Artois region of northern France. Initially an island, this dome-like structure was drained by the ancestors of the rivers which today cut through the North and South Downs (including the Mole, Wey, Arun and Adur). The dome was eroded away over the course of the Cenozoic, exposing the strata beneath and resulting in the escarpments of the Downs and the Greensand Ridge. Chalk is a relatively soft rock that may be eroded or weathered in a number of different ways. It is porous, absorbing up to 20% of its dry weight in water, and is therefore highly susceptible to weathering by freeze-thaw action, which may occur over repeated annual or diurnal cycles. This frost weathering produces a mix of rubble and viscous mud, which may be washed downhill, further eroding the landscape (a process known as solifluction). At the west side of Box Hill, the hydraulic action of the River Mole has cut a cliff known as The Whites and the river bed contains coarse chalk rubble (clast), which has fallen from the steep slopes above. Since the chalk contains a very high percentage of calcium carbonate, it can be dissolved by ground water and solubilisation of the rock at the base of the hill may have produced the slabwise slumping or subsidence visible at the top of the Burford Spur. Finally, rainwater, which is mildly acidic, will dissolve and react with the chalk. One of two steep-sided combes (dry river valleys) on the western side of Headley Heath. The eastern and northern boundaries of Box Hill are defined by dry river valleys, now occupied by Pebblehill Road and Headley Lane respectively. These valleys were active during the last ice age, when the chalk bedrock became frozen and impermeable, forcing water to run over the surface in streams rather than percolating into the ground. Both valleys are narrow, twisting and deep, suggesting that they were created by fast flowing torrents, possibly released during periods of rapid snowmelt. The northern side of Box Hill (corresponding to the dip slope of the cuesta of the North Downs) is cut by six combes, also created by Ice Age watercourses. The westernmost of these combes (between the Burford Spur and Lodge Hill) is climbed by the Zig Zag Road. There is a small reservoir to the west of High Ashurst at the base of the Bullen Wood combe, which is not accessible to the public. All six combes contained tributaries of the stream that created the Headley Valley, which joined the River Mole near Fredley, Mickleham. Quarries and lime kilns The Smidth Kiln at Betchworth Quarry was constructed in around 1901. Chalk and flint have been quarried from Box Hill and the surrounding area for many centuries. There are limited surviving examples of the incorporation of chalk blocks (or clunch) into the stonework of local buildings (including Mickleham Church). Walls made of flints, bound together by lime mortar, are particularly common in Surrey and quicklime could be produced with relative ease, by heating chalk above in a kiln. Evidence remains of the small-scale chalk quarrying that occurred prior to the Industrial Revolution, including chalk pits both at Warren Farm and close to the Burford Bridge Hotel. The opening of the Dorking to Reigate railway line at the bottom of the hill in 1849, enabled new quarry faces to be opened at Brockham and Betchworth. Sidings were provided adjacent to the main line and there was an extensive network of narrow-gauge railway tracks at both sites. The Brockham Limeworks closed in 1935, however a battery of eight kilns (dating from 1870) still stands and is Grade II listed. The larger Betchworth Quarry and Lime Kilns (approximately 1 km to the east) closed in 1960 and a variety of different kiln types have been preserved and protected with a Grade II listing. The two sites have been designated as Nature Reserves and are managed by Surrey Wildlife Trust. A wide range of bat species now roost in the former kilns. Gravel was quarried on the northern side of Headley Heath during the 18th and early 19th centuries, most likely to provide material for building local roads. Fossils Numerous fossils, typical of species living in a warm, shallow sea, have been found in the chalk at Box Hill, including brachiopods (Terebratulina gracilis, Terebratulina carnea and Rhynchonella cuvieri), arthropods (Janira quinquecostatus), bivalves (Spondylus spinosus and Ostrea hippodium), urchins (Holaster planus, Micraster leskei) and sponges (Plinthosella squamata). Ecology=Conservation Belted Galloway cattle grazing the Burford Spur on the north western side of the hill. The entirety of Box Hill lies within the Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The vast majority of the publicly accessible areas of the hill that are managed by the National Trust and Surrey Wildlife Trust, form part of the Mole Gap to Reigate Escarpment Site of Special Scientific Interest and have been designated a Special Area of Conservation. The chalk downland of Box Hill provides a habitat for a wide range of plant species, which in turn support a varied population of insect species. The alkaline soils are thin and nutrient poor, which prevents deeper-rooted lush grasses (with a high water demand) from dominating. Each square metre of chalk downland may support up to 40 different species. Without careful management, the grassland would revert to woodland and so these areas of the hill are grazed in order to prevent scrub from becoming overestablished. Both the National Trust and Surrey Wildlife Trust use Belted Galloway cattle (affectionately nicknamed 'Belties'), which crop the grass less hard than other grazers and allow the more delicate wild flowers (including orchids) to flourish. At Betchworth Quarry, Surrey Wildlife Trust allows goats to graze, which can eat woodier plants such as gorse and bramble. Rabbits also make a significant contribution to the control of scrub and coarse grasses on the hill, although their numbers have declined since the introduction of myxomatosis in 1953. Olympic Rings were installed at the viewpoint in July 2012. For any conservation area, it is important to find a balance between the interests of people visiting and the needs of the wildlife that it seeks to protect. After the announcement that the Olympic cycling road races would be routed over the hill, concerns were expressed that habitats would be damaged during the event. Scrub clearance along the side of the Zig Zag Road to provide space for spectators began in January 2012, after a pre-race survey (commissioned by the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games) showed that the work was likely to increase biodiversity. A second ecological survey, performed after the Games, showed that no significant damage had occurred, although some areas were subsequently reseeded. Biodiversity The chalk downland environment supports notable populations of bats, lepidopterans, orchids and the hill's namesake, the box tree (Buxus sempervirens).Box Hill Community Website Retrieved 4 February 2008 =Orchids= A large number of species of orchid have been recorded on Box Hill, including autumn lady's-tresses, bee orchids, bird's-nest orchids, broad-leaved helleborines, common spotted orchids, common twayblades, fragrant orchids, pyramidal orchids and white helleborines. =Other wild flowers= Wild garlic grows alongside bluebells under the tree canopy beside the River Mole at the western edge of the hill, giving the area its distinctive smell in springtime. =Aquatic plants= Damasonium alisma (starfruit) was reintroduced to Headley Heath in 2013 using seeds from the Millennium Seed Bank, having been absent since 2000. It is now found in Brimmer Pond (half of which is enclosed to prevent habitat disturbance by dogs) and also in Heath House Pond. =Trees= Yew and box trees growing on the west side of the hill. The box and yew woodland, on the steep-sloping sides of the hill above the River Mole, is of international importance. Common canopy-layer species include beech, ash and oak. Understorey species include holly, hazel, elder and honeysuckle. Invasive species found on the hill include buddleia, cherry laurel, Japanese knot weed and Canadian goldenrod. Boxwood blight, a fungal disease caused by Cylindrocladium buxicola, is widespread. =Bats= Several abandoned brick and concrete structures provide habitats for bats and grills have been placed over their entrances to protect the roosting sites. Three species are known to inhabit the old Box Hill Fort: the brown long-eared bat, the noctule bat and Natterer's bat. The brown long-eared bat, Natterer's bat, the whiskered bat and Daubenton's bat have been recorded at both Betchworth and Brockham quarries. Brandt's bat has been recorded at Betchworth; Bechstein's bat and the common pipistrelle have been recorded at Brockham. =Butterflies and Moths= Box Hill supports 38 different species of butterflies. Species include silver-spotted skipper, Adonis blue and chalkhill blue (grassland); brown hairstreak (scrub); purple emperor and white admiral (woodland). The small pearl-bordered fritillary was present on the hill in the 1970s, but has not been recorded locally since 1997. Kidney vetch, growing in the Zig Zag Valley and below the Viewpoint, supports populations of the small blue. To create new habitats for the butterflies, a number of ‚Äòscrapes‚Äô were excavated in the late 2010s, exposing bare chalk on which vetch can become established with minimal competition. Buddleia removal was also initiated as part of the same programme. Rare moth species found on the hill include the straw belle, chalk carpet, lace border, orange-tailed clearwing and the Surrey midget moth. =Other insects= The hill has given its name to a species of squash bug, now found throughout south-east England. Recreation Salomons Memorial viewpoint, looking south, in 2010 Box Hill Country Park The western part of Box Hill, managed by the National Trust, was designated a Country Park in 1971 and some of the outbuildings associated with the Box Hill Fort are in use as a visitor centre, gift shop and servery. In 2011, a Natural Play Trail was constructed close to the visitor centre, cofunded by the National Trust and the Friends of Box Hill. On the hill there are car parks and a panoramic view over the Weald towards the South Downs may be enjoyed from the Salomons Memorial (more commonly known as the viewpoint). Juniper Top, on the northern side of the hill, offers views to the northwest towards Windsor Castle. The Country Park is crisscrossed by a large number of footpaths and bridleways, and there are several signposted, self-guided trails. Cycling Box Hill has been popular with cyclists since the 1880s and by the 1890s, Dorking Cycle Club was organising camps for amateur cyclists from across the south east of England. The 2012 Summer Olympic cycling road races included mid-race circuits of Box Hill. An estimated 15,000 spectators travelled to the hill on 28 July 2012 to watch the men's race, which included nine circuits and the following day, competitors in the women's race climbed Box Hill twice. The Box Hill Olympic circuit is generally cycled in an anticlockwise direction and begins to the south of the village of Mickleham with an ascent of the hill via the Zig Zag Road. From the National Trust Visitor Centre, the route turns eastwards, running along the escarpment and through the urban area of Box Hill village, reaching a maximum elevation of above Ordnance Datum. After the route turns northwest along the B2033, passing through the village of Headley. After , the circuit begins a continuous descent to the valley of the River Mole, passing to the south of Leatherhead, before turning southwards again through Mickleham to return to the start. The Zig Zag Road is a steady climb of over and has, although on a much smaller scale, been likened to the Alpe d'Huez in the French Alps. The exact date of construction is uncertain: The road first appears on the Ordnance Survey map of 1869, but is not shown in a watercolour painting dated 1861 by William Leighton Leitch, which is owned by the Royal Collection. The Zig Zag Road is not a public right of way and is closed for one day each year by the National Trust, to preserve its private road status. As part of the 2011 London Prepares series, the London‚ÄìSurrey Cycle Classic for professional cyclists was organised to test the Olympic course. The Prudential RideLondon-Surrey 100 and London‚ÄìSurrey Classic, for amateur and professional cyclists respectively, have taken place annually following the Games and, although the course has undergone several alterations from the 2012 Olympic course, the two races always include a climb of Box Hill. High Ashurst High Ashurst is an outdoor education and activity centre on the northern side of Box Hill, adjacent to Headley Heath. The centre is run by Surrey Outdoor Learning and Development on behalf of Surrey County Council. Previously the site comprised the grounds of a country house, which was demolished in the 1970s, having been derelict for several decades. Boidier Hurst campsite The District Scout Associations of Leatherhead and Epsom and Ewell own a campsite, located between Box Hill village and Headley Heath. There are 11 areas for pitching groups of tents, set within coppiced chestnut woodland. Washing, toilet facilities and a kitchen are available. Use of Boidier Hurst is restricted to members of The Scout Association, The Guide Association and to local school groups on Duke of Edinburgh's Award expeditions. Points of Interest=Betchworth Clump The highest point on Box Hill is immediately to the east of Box Hill village at above OD. The area is known as Betchworth Clump after a distinctive group of beech trees, which were present at the start of the 20th century. Today, the dense woodland at the summit conceals a water tower and transmitter mast, neither of which are accessible to the public. The concrete water tower was built in 1930 by East Surrey Water, the forerunner of SES Water. The structure was refurbished in 2009 to extend its working life by at least 25 years; modifications included the relining of the water bowl, repair of cracks in the walls and roof, as well as the provision of a new access staircase. The 30m-high mobile phone mast was constructed in 2003 and is operated by Vodafone and EE Limited. Broadwood's Folly Broadwood's Folly was built in around 1820. Part of the Zig Zag Road is visible to the right of the tower. The circular flint tower located on the northern tip of Lodge Hill was built for the piano maker Thomas Broadwood, who purchased Juniper Hall in 1815. It is approximately high and originally had two internal floors, linked by a spiral staircase. The original doorway is visible on the east side, but has been sealed with rough flints. An avenue of beech trees linked the folly to Juniper Hall, although these were destroyed by the Great Storm of 1987. The tower may have been built to commemorate the Battle of Waterloo. A sparkling wine, produced by Denbies Wine Estate for the Lidl supermarket chain, has been named after the folly. Labilliere's Grave Labilliere's tombstone Peter Labilliere was born in Dublin on 30 May 1725 to a family of French Huguenot descent. He joined the British Army at the age of 14, becoming a major in 1760. After leaving the army he became a political agitator and was accused in 1775 of bribing British troops not to fight in the American War of Independence, although he was never tried for treason. After moving to Dorking in around 1789, Labilliere often visited Box Hill to meditate. With old age he became increasingly eccentric and neglected his own personal hygiene to such an extent that he acquired the nickname \\"the walking dung-hill\\". He died on 6 June 1800. In accordance with his wishes he was buried head downwards, on 11 June on the western side of Box Hill above The Whites. In the presence of a crowd of thousands that included visitors from London as well as the local \\"quality gentry\\",Major Peter Labelliere: Strange history of man buried upside down atop Box Hill , Surrey Mirror, by W. H. Chouler, July 1963 Labilliere was buried without any religious ceremony, having reportedly said that the world was \\"topsy-turvey\\" and that it would be righted in the end if he were interred thus. But this preference was not mentioned in his \\"Book of Devotions\\": rather he there said that he wished to emulate the example of St Peter, who was crucified upside-down according to tradition. The current memorial stone on Box Hill is not believed to mark the exact location of his burial (which is thought to be several metres to the west on a steep incline). There are two errors on the stone itself: He was buried in June 1800 (rather than July) and all surviving manuscripts indicate that he spelt his name Labilliere (rather than Labelliere). Weypole and Stepping Stones The Stepping Stones at the foot of Box Hill. The photograph is taken from the west bank of the Mole, looking across the river to the Weypole. The Weypole (or Waypole) is a roughly semi-circular area of level ground at the foot of Box Hill, between The Whites and the River Mole. The area was originally part of the grounds of Burford Lodge, built by John Eckersall in 1776, and the apple and cherry trees in the area suggest that it was used as an orchard for a time. The Burford Lodge estate was later owned by the horticulturalist Sir Trevor Lawrence, who created a garden along the banks of the Mole for his collection of orchids. A ford across the River Mole is thought to have existed here since prehistoric times. The way-pole was a notched post secured in the riverbed, to indicate the depth of the water. Stepping stones at this site are first recorded in 1841 and they may have been installed by an owner of Burford Lodge to facilitate access to the Weypole orchard. The current stones were dedicated on 11 September 1946 by Prime Minister Clement Attlee, at the request of James Chuter Ede, local politician and Attlee's Home Secretary,Chuter Ede papers collection, Surrey History Centre, 6408/13 replacing those destroyed during World War II as an anti- invasion measure. The spot is popular with both anglers and families, although swimming is strongly discouraged. The stones give their name to the pub in the nearby village of Westhumble. Other The Burford Bridge Hotel and Juniper Hall Field Studies Centre lie at the foot of Box Hill close to the river Mole. Both are rich in historical associations with famous visitors and residents. Notable former residents=John Logie Baird John Logie Baird (1888-1946), the inventor of the first working television system, lived at Box Hill from 1929 until 1932. He had first demonstrated the new technology in early 1926, and continued with his work when he moved to Swiss Cottage on the top of the hill. He installed a small-scale electricity generating plant in a purpose-built outbuilding, to provide electrical power for his experiments, which included test transmissions to the roof of the Red Lion pub in Dorking High Street. He also demonstrated his Noctovisor, an infrared viewing device, which was designed to enable ships to see each other at night or in fog. Swiss Cottage was built in the mid-19th century and is protected by a Grade II listing. It is not accessible to the public. Brodie family Brockham Warren was the family seat of the Brodie baronets. Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 1st Baronet (1783-1862) was a physiologist and surgeon, who performed pioneering research into bone and joint diseases. He served as sergeant- surgeon to both William IV and subsequently Queen Victoria. He was made a baronet in 1834 and was President of the Royal Society from 1858 to 1861. His son, Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie, 2nd Baronet (1817-1880), was a Chemistry Professor at Oxford University from 1865 to 1872, and is chiefly known for his investigations into the allotropic states of carbon and for his discovery of graphitic acid. George Meredith George Meredith and family members, photographed in the rear garden of Flint Cottage, Box Hill. The author George Meredith (1828-1909) lived in Flint Cottage from 1868 until his death. He built a chalet in the garden in which he wrote. Today the house is protected by a Grade II listing and is not accessible to the public. Among several works written at Box Hill, his poem The Lark Ascending, published in 1881, inspired Ralph Vaughan Williams to compose the musical work of the same name. A second poem, Love in the Valley (published in 1883 as part of a collection entitled Poems and Lyrics of the Joy of Earth), is said to have been inspired by the part of Box Hill known as Juniper Bottom or Happy Valley. The part of the hill immediately opposite the cottage is known as Barrie's Bank, because the author J. M. Barrie supposedly waited there, while summoning the courage to introduce himself to Meredith. EF Warburg The botanist Edmund Frederic (\\"Heff\\") Warburg (1908-1966) grew up at Boidier, a house close to the southeastern corner of Headley Heath. His father was a keen gardener and had assembled a large collection of exotic plants at the family home. Heff became reader in plant taxonomy at Oxford University and was a fellow of New College. His mother, Lady Warburg, gave the land for Boidier Hurst Camp Site to the District Scout Associations of Leatherhead and Epsom and Ewell in 1946 and her family donated the neighbouring, Heath Plantation to the National Trust following her death in 1952. Edvard Westermarck The Finnish philosopher and sociologist Edvard Westermarck (1862-1939) rented Keeper's Cottage as his summer residence between 1910 and 1927. Registered Charities The National Trust owns around half of the land on Box Hill (principally the Country Park in the west and Headley Heath in the north-east). Surrey Wildlife Trust manage Brockham Limeworks (owned by Surrey County Council) as well as Betchworth Quarry and Lime Kilns (privately owned). Both Trusts rely on the support of volunteer groups, working alongside paid employees, to carry out conservation and education work. The Friends of Box Hill (FoBH) is a local organisation, which supports the National Trust in its work in the Country Park. Several of its members advise the Trust on its wildlife management plans and the FoBH also fund specific projects, including the purchase of equipment and improvement of visitor facilities. They also organise a programme of social events, which includes regular talks by Trust staff. The Friends of Headley Heath (FoHH) coordinate volunteer working parties to assist National Trust Rangers and also run a series of social events. (Both the FoBH and FoHH are independent of the National Trust.) Transport Links=Public Transport is the closest railway station to the National Trust Country Park (approximately 500 m) and is served by trains from both London Victoria and London Waterloo. Both and Dorking (Main) stations are around 1 km from the south western corner of the hill. station is at the south eastern corner of the hill. A Sunray Travel bus passing the visitor centre. Inset left shows the special wooden National Trust bus stop, with logo engraved. Box Hill is served by local and London bus routes. Access for Motor Vehicles Access to the National Trust Country Park from the A24 dual carriageway is via the B2209 and the Zig Zag Road, however this route is not suitable for buses or coaches. Alternative access is via the B2033 and Boxhill Road, which leads through Box Hill village and approaches the Country Park from the west. Headley Heath is directly accessible from the B2033. Cycle Routes National Cycle Route 22 runs along the northern boundary of the hill via Lodgebottom Road and Headley Lane, before turning south along the A24 close to the western boundary. The Surrey Cycleway approaches Box Hill from the west via Westhumble, before turning to the south towards Dorking. Walking The North Downs Way long- distance footpath from Farnham to Dover, crosses the River Mole at the Stepping Stones and then runs from west to east at the top of the scarp slope, passing in front of the Salomons Memorial. The Thames Down Link follows the course of Stane Street across Mickleham Downs, to the north of Box Hill, and meets the North Downs Way close to the Burford Bridge Hotel.

A watercolour entitled Box Hill, Surrey dated 1861 by William Leighton Leitch (1804‚Äì1883), which depicts the view looking northwards from the top of the Burford Spur before the Zig Zag Road was built, is part of the Royal Collection. The Box Hill Road River, a highly curved, line painted onto the surface of the Zig Zag Road by the British sculptor and land artist Richard Long, was commissioned jointly by the London 2012 Festival and the National Trust to celebrate the route of the Olympic Cycling road races. Literature John Evelyn notes in his Diary in 1662 that Box Hill was frequented by the ladies and gentlemen from nearby Epsom spa.Noted in Alice M. Coats, Garden Shrubs and Their Histories (1964) 1992, s.v. \\"Buxus\\". Daniel Defoe (the author of Robinson Crusoe) was educated for five years (until around the age of fourteen) at the Rev. James Fisher's boarding school in Pixham Lane, Dorking. He writes extensively about the area around Box Hill in his travelogue, A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain (1724‚Äì1727), which describes the country shortly before the start of the Industrial Revolution. He records that in the late 17th century, Sir Adam Browne the then landowner, approved the fitting out of a cave or vault close to what is now the Salomons Memorial, to supply 'refreshment' to visitors to the hill. A group of young Dissenters from Dorking were so disgusted by the 'debauched' behaviour that the sale of alcohol encouraged (which took place even on Sundays), that they stormed up the hill one Saturday night and blew up the cavern with gunpowder. Celia Fiennes, a contemporary of Defoe's, described Box Hill in her travel memoirs, which were published in 1888 (almost 150 years after her death) under the title Through England on a Side Saddle. :\\"Box Hill‚Ä¶ is the Continuation of the Ridge of hills I mentiond by Maidstone; its a Greate height and shows you a vast precipice down on the farther side, and such a vast vale full of woods Enclosures and Little towns. There is a very good river that runs by a Little town Called Darken just at the foote of this hill, very famous for good troutts and great store of ffish. On this hill the top is Cover'd with box whence its name proceeds, and there is other wood but its all Cutt in Long private walks very shady and pleasant, and this is a great diversion to the Company and would be more ffrequented if nearer Epsom town.\\" The writer Edward Beavan describes the hill and the surrounding area of Surrey in his poem Box-Hill, a descriptive poem, published in 1777.

Brimley Johnson, 1904), edited by Lucian Oldershaw, and in a chapter entitled \\"The Patriotic Idea\\" written by G. K. Chesterton, the beauty of Box Hill violated by an invading army is used to express a healthy patriot's love for his nation as opposed to the jingoistic nationalism of tabloid newspapers: :\\"But just as a man who has been in love will find it difficult to write a whole frantic epic about a flirtation, so all that kind of rhetoric about the Union Jack and the Anglo-Saxon blood, which has made amusing the journalism of this country for the last six years, will be merely impossible to the man who has for one moment called up before himself what would be the real sensation of hearing that a foreign army was encamped on Box Hill.\\" Mystery author Cyril Hare sets his 1954 novel, That Yew Tree's Shade (published in the U.S. as Death Walks the Woods), at \\"Yew Hill\\", which Hare admits in an introduction is modelled on Box Hill. In his comic novel, Box Hill, published in 2020, British author Adam Mars-Jones tells the story of a same-sex relationship between a teenager and an older man, set within the Surrey motorbiking fraternity of the mid-1970s. Music British biker rock band Dumpy's Rusty Nuts released a single called Box Hill or Bust in 1984. The song is something of a cult anthem for bikers and reflects the popularity of Box Hill among the biking community. In Richard Thompson's song 1952 Vincent Black Lightning (released in 1991), Box Hill is the location to which James and Red Molly ride on James' motorcycle. In cover versions of this song by American musicians, Box Hill is sometimes changed to Knoxville, a city in Tennessee.

Table where Treaty of Vereeniging was signed Melrose House is a stately mansion and museum located on Burgers Park in Pretoria, South Africa. History Built in 1886 by the prosperous Pretoria businessman George Jesse Heys, it was named after the famous Melrose Abbey in Scotland. Melrose House gained fame during the Second Boer War (1899-1902) when Lord Roberts requisitioned it as the headquarters for the British forces after Pretoria was invaded in June 1900. For more than 18 months, instructions for the British forces in the field were issued from here. The use of the house as a military headquarters ended when the Treaty of Vereeniging, which ended the war, was signed there on 31 May 1902. The Pretoria City Council purchased the house and its contents in 1967 for R300,000 for restoration, culminating in State President of South Africa Charles Robberts Swart opening it as a museum and declaring it a national heritage site on May 17, 1971. Museum Today the elegant mansion is a historic house museum. It is an example of the transition from Victorian to Edwardian architectural styles and interiors. The interior is characterised by colourful stained glass windows, paintings by English artists, carpets in rich colours, ornate ceilings and fireplaces, as well as valuable porcelain ornaments. The majority of these items belonged to the Heys family itself. Notably the museum contains the room and the table on which the Treaty of Vereeniging (which ended the Second Boer War) was signed. Annual antique markets are held on the premises.  Bibliography  * W√™reldspektrum, 1982, , vol. 18, p. 114 * Fisher, Roger C. (compiler): Visuele leksikon van die Suid-Afrikaanse woning.

He was one of the most famous and revered composers of the second half of the 14th century, and by far the most famous composer in Italy.  Life  Details of Landini's life are sketchy and few facts can be established with certainty, but the general outline has begun to take shape as more research has been done, especially into Florentine records. Most of the original biographical data on him comes from a 1385 book on famous Florentine citizens by chronicler Filippo Villani, who was also born approximately 1325. Modern scholars no longer accept the idea that Landini was a member of the Landini family and prefer to use the names 'Francesco da Firenze' (Francesco of Firenze), 'Francesco degli Organi' or 'Francesco degliorghani' (Francesco of the organs) and 'Francesco il Cieco' or 'Franciscus cecus' (Francesco the blind) to refer to the composer. The reason is that the surname 'Landini' or 'Landino' has not been linked to the composer in any sources of the 14th century nor in secondary references in the 15th century. The evidence linking Francesco to the Landini family via his presumed father, who was identified by Filippo Villani as a painter who lived a simple life is no longer accepted by art historians. It can therefore also no longer be maintained that the painter Jacopo del Casentino (formerly also referred to as 'Jacopo Landino') was his father or that Cristoforo Landino was his great-nephew.Michael Scott Cuthbert, 'Trecento Fragments And Polyphony Beyond The Codex', a thesis presented to the Department of Music in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the subject of Music. Harvard University Cambridge, Massachusetts, August 2006, p. 492-495 Landini's tombstone with him shown playing a portative organ Landini was most likely born in Florence, though Cristoforo Landino, gave his birthplace as Fiesole. Blind from childhood (an effect of contracting smallpox), Landini became devoted to music early in life, and mastered many instruments, including the lute, as well as the art of singing, writing poetry, and composition. Villani, in his chronicle, also stated that Landini was an inventor of instruments, including a stringed instrument called the 'syrena syrenarum', that combined features of the lute and psaltery, and it is believed to be the ancestor of the bandura. Despite his young age, Landini was already active in the early 1350s and it is likely that he was very close to Petrarch.Chiappinelli Anna, La Dolce Musica Nova di Francesco Landini (Una Favola Medievale), Sidereus Nuncius, 2007. According to Villani, Landini was given a crown of laurel by the King of Cyprus, who was in Venice for several periods during the 1360s. Landini probably spent some time in northern Italy prior to 1370. Evidence in some of his music also points to this: a motet by a certain \\"Franciscus\\" is dedicated to Andrea Contarini, who was Doge of Venice from 1368 to 1382; and in addition, his works are well represented in northern Italian sources. He was employed as organist at the Florentine monastery of Santa Trinit√† in 1361, and at the church of San Lorenzo from 1365 onward. He was heavily involved in the political and religious controversies of his day, according to Villani, but he seems to have remained in the good graces of the Florentine authorities. Landini knew many of the other Italian composers of the Trecento, including Lorenzo da Firenze, with whom he was associated at Santa Trinit√†, as well as Andreas da Florentia, whom he knew in the 1370s. Around or shortly after 1375, Andreas hired him as a consultant to help build the organ at the Servite house in Florence. Among the surviving records are the receipts for the wine that the two consumed during the three days it had taken to tune the instrument. Landini also helped build the new organ at SS Annunziata in 1379, and in 1387 he was involved in yet another organ-building project, this time at Florence Cathedral. Numerous contemporary writers attest to his fame, not only as a composer, but as a singer, poet, organist, philosopher, and passionately devoted citizen of Florence, notably Giovanni da Prato, in his book Paradiso degli Alberti. This book, written in 1389 contains short stories, one of which supposedly was related by Landini himself. His reputation for moving an audience with his music was so powerful that writers noted \\"the sweetness of his melodies was such that hearts burst from their bosoms.\\" Richard H. Hoppin, Medieval Music, p. 455. New York, W.W. Norton & Co., 1978. He is buried in the church of San Lorenzo in Florence. His tombstone, lost until the 19th century and now again displayed in the church, contains a depiction of him with a portative organ. Music and influence Landini was the foremost exponent of the Italian Trecento style, sometimes also called the \\"Italian ars nova\\". His output was almost exclusively secular. While there are records that he composed sacred music, none of it has survived. What have survived are eighty-nine ballate for two voices, forty-two ballate for three voices, and another nine which exist in both two and three-voice versions. In addition to the ballate, a smaller number of madrigals have survived. Landini is assumed to have written his own texts for many of his works. His output, preserved most completely in the Squarcialupi Codex, represents almost a quarter of all surviving 14th-century Italian music. Landini is the eponym of the Landini cadence (or Landino sixth), a cadential formula whereby the sixth degree of the scale (the submediant) is inserted between the leading note and its resolution on the tonic. However this cadence neither originated with him, nor is unique to his music; it can be found in much polyphonic music of the period, and well into the 15th century (for example in the songs of Gilles Binchois). Gherardello da Firenze is the earliest composer to use the cadence whose works have survived. Yet Landini used the formula consistently throughout his music, so the eponym‚Äîwhich dates from after the medieval era‚Äîis appropriate.

Programs that call SWT are portable, but the implementation of the toolkit, despite part of it being written in Java, is unique for each platform. The toolkit is free and open-source software distributed under the Eclipse Public License, which is approved by the Open Source Initiative.  History  The first Java GUI toolkit was the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), introduced with Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.0 as one component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original AWT was a simple Java wrapper library around native (operating system-supplied) widgets such as menus, windows, and buttons. Swing was the next generation GUI toolkit introduced by Sun in Java Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) 1.2. Swing was developed to provide a richer set of GUI software components than AWT. Swing GUI elements are all-Java with no native code: instead of wrapping native GUI components, Swing draws its own components by using Java 2D to call low-level operating system drawing routines. The roots of SWT go back to work that Object Technology International (OTI), did in the 1990s when creating multiplatform, portable, native widget interfaces for Smalltalk, originally for OTI Smalltalk, which became IBM Smalltalk in 1993. IBM Smalltalk's Common Widget layer provided fast, native access to multiple platform widget sets while still providing a common API without suffering the lowest common denominator problem typical of other portable graphical user interface (GUI) toolkits. IBM was developing VisualAge, an integrated development environment (IDE) written in Smalltalk. They decided to open-source the project, which led to the development of Eclipse, intended to compete against other IDEs such as Microsoft Visual Studio. Eclipse is written in Java, and IBM developers, deciding that they needed a toolkit that had \\"native look and feel\\" and \\"native performance\\", created SWT as a Swing replacement.  Design  SWT is a wrapper around native code objects, such as GTK+ objects, Motif objects etc. Because of this, SWT widgets are often referred to as \\"heavyweight\\", evoking images of a light Java wrapper around a \\"heavy\\" native object. In cases where native platform GUI libraries do not support the functionality required for SWT, SWT implements its own GUI code in Java, similar to Swing. In essence, SWT is a compromise between the low level performance and look and feel of AWT and the high level ease of use of Swing. According to the Eclipse Foundation, \\"SWT and Swing are different tools that were built with different goals in mind. The purpose of SWT is to provide a common API for accessing native widgets across a spectrum of platforms. The primary design goals are high performance, native look and feel, and deep platform integration. Swing, on the other hand, is designed to allow for a highly customizable look and feel that is common across all platforms.\\" It has been argued that SWT features a clean design, in part inspired by Erich Gamma of Design Patterns fame. SWT is a simpler toolkit than Swing, with less (possibly) extraneous functionality for the average developer. This has led some people to argue that SWT lacks functionality when compared to Swing. James Gosling, the creator of the Java language, has argued that SWT is too simple, and is a difficult toolkit to port to new platforms for the same reason that AWT once had porting problems: that it is too simple, too low level, and too tied to the Win32 GUI API, leading to problems adapting the SWT API to other GUI toolkits, such as Motif and OS X Carbon. Although SWT does not implement the popular model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller (MVC) architecture used in Swing and many other high level GUI toolkits, the JFace library, which is developed as part of the same Eclipse project, does provide a cross-platform, higher-level MVC abstraction atop SWT. Developers may choose to use JFace to provide more flexible and abstract data models for complex SWT controls such as trees, tables, and lists, or access those controls directly as needed.  Look and feel  SWT widgets have the same look and feel as native widgets because they often are the same native widgets. This is in contrast to the Swing toolkit where all widgets are emulations of native widgets. In some cases the difference is distinguishable. For example, the macOS tree widget features a subtle animation when a tree is expanded and default buttons actually have an animated pulsing glow to focus the user's attention on them. The default Swing version of these widgets do not animate. Since SWT is simply a wrapper around native GUI code, it does not require large numbers of updates when that native code is changed, providing that operating system vendors are careful not to break clients of their API when the operating systems are updated. The same cannot be said of Swing, which supports the ability to change the look and feel of the running application with \\"pluggable looks and feels\\". These enable emulating the native platform user interface using themes, which must be updated to mirror operating system GUI changes, such as theme or other look and feel updates. SWT aims for \\"deep platform integration\\", the Eclipse reference to SWT's use of native widgets. According to Mauro Marinillia of developer.com, \\"whenever one needs a tight integration with the native platform, SWT can be a plus\\". This deep integration can be useful in a number of ways, for example enabling SWT to wrap ActiveX objects on Microsoft Windows.  Programming  A simple GUI application using SWT running in a GTK+ environment The following is a basic Hello World program using SWT. It shows a window (Shell) and a label. import org.eclipse.swt.*; import org.eclipse.swt.widgets.*; public class HelloWorld { public static void main (String[] args) { Display display = new Display(); Shell shell = new Shell(display); Label label = new Label(shell, SWT.NONE); label.setText(\\"Hello World\\"); label.pack(); shell.pack(); shell.open(); while (!shell.isDisposed()) { if (!display.readAndDispatch()) display.sleep(); } display.dispose(); } } Contrary to Swing, a Display class is necessary to access the underlying operating system, and its resources must be explicitly disposed of when they are no longer used.  Platform support  Vuze, a BitTorrent client which uses SWT, running in a GTK+ environment SWT must be ported to every new GUI library that needs supporting. Unlike Swing and AWT, SWT is not available on every Java-supported platform since SWT is not part of the Java release. There is also some evidence that the performance of SWT on platforms other than Windows is noticeably less efficient. Since SWT uses a different native library for each platform, SWT programs may be exposed to platform-specific bugs. SWT exposes programs to more low level details than Swing. This is because SWT is technically just a layer over native library provided GUI functionality, exposing the programmer to native GUI code is part of the design intent of SWT: \\"Its goal is not to provide a rich user-interface design framework but rather the thinnest possible user-interface API that can be implemented uniformly on the largest possible set of platforms while still providing sufficient functionality to build rich graphical user interface (GUI) applications.\\" Since the SWT implementation is different for each platform, a platform-specific SWT library (JAR file) must be distributed with each application. , SWT supports these platforms and/or GUI libraries: * Windows: ** Win32 ** Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), under development * Unix-like: Linux, FreeBSD: ** GTK+ * macOS: ** Cocoa , SWT 4.7.3a (and 4.8M6) is officially compatible with the following operating systems (graphic library or similar if explicitly required / processors):http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/R-4.7.3a-201803300640/ * Microsoft Windows (x86 and x86_64) * Linux (GTK+ / PPC64 and PPC64LE) * macOS (Cocoa / x86_64) Windows XP has historically been supported. Older version additionally officially supported s390, Solaris 11 (SPARCv9), Solaris 10 (x86_64), HP-UX (ia64), AIX (PPC and PPC64).  Performance  SWT was designed to be a high performance GUI toolkit; faster, more responsive and lighter on system resource usage than Swing. There has been some attempted benchmarking of SWT and Swing, which concluded that SWT should be more efficient than Swing, although the applications benchmarked in this case were not complex enough to draw solid conclusions for all possible SWT or Swing uses.. A fairly thorough set of benchmarks concluded that neither Swing nor SWT clearly outperformed the other in the general case..  Extensibility and comparison to other Java code  Due to the use of native code, SWT classes do not allow for easy inheritance for all widget classes, which some users consider can hurt extensibility. This can make customizing existing widgets more difficult to achieve with SWT than if one were using Swing. Both toolkits support writing new widgets using only Java code, however in SWT extra work is needed to make the new widget work on every platform. SWT widgets, unlike almost any other Java toolkit, requires manual object deallocation, in contrast to the standard Java practice of automatic garbage collection. SWT objects must be explicitly deallocated using the \`dispose\` method, which is analogous to the C language's \`free\`.The Java developers guide to Eclipse, 2nd ed., p359 If this is not done, memory leaks or other unintended behavior may result. On this matter, some have commented that \\"explicitly de-allocating the resources could be a step back in development time (and costs) at least for the average Java developer\\" and that \\"this is a mixed blessing. It means more control (and more complexity) for the SWT developer instead of more automation (and slowness) when using Swing.\\" The need for manual object deallocation when using SWT is largely due to SWT's use of native objects. These objects are not tracked by the Java JVM, so it cannot track whether or not such objects are in use, and thus cannot garbage collect them at a suitable time. In practice, the only SWT objects which a program must explicitly dispose are the subclasses of Resource, such as Image, Color, and Font objects.  Development  There is some development activity to enable combining Swing and SWT. Two different approaches are being attempted: * SwingWT is a project to provide an alternative Swing implementation. It uses an SWT back end to display its widgets, thus providing the native look and feel and performance advantages of SWT along with the same programming model as Swing. * SWTSwing is a project to provide a Swing back end for SWT. In effect, SWT could be run using Swing native objects instead of, for example, GTK or Windows native objects. This would enable SWT to work on every platform that Swing supports. Starting in 2006, there was a SWT-3.2 port to the programming language D called DWT. Since then, the project supports Windows 32-bit, and Linux GTK 32-bit for SWT-3.4. The DWT project also has an addon package that contains a port of JFace and Eclipse Forms. With JavaFX becoming part of the Java SE platform there has been interest in developing a backend for SWT that relies on JavaFX in a similar way to SWTSwing relies on Swing. A prominent project trying to achieve that was SWT on JavaFX that became part of e(fx)clipse in 2014.  Uses  Applications (alphabetically sorted) using SWT include: * Apache Directory Studio, an LDAP browser‚Äìeditor * BiglyBT, a fork of Vuze * Eclipse and its plug-ins * GumTree Platform, scientific workbench * Haystack, information manager * IBM Rational Software products: Rational Application Developer, Rational Software Architect, Rational Team Concert and others. * IBM Lotus software products: Notes, Sametime, Symphony, and Expeditor * MongoChef, GUI client for MongoDB database * RSSOwl, feed aggregator * SmartGit, a Git, Mercurial, and Apache Subversion (SVN) client * TuxGuitar, an open source tablature editor * uDig, GIS tool * Vuze, formerly named Azureus Recent open source efforts in the eclipse community have led to a porting of SWT (and JFace) into a widget toolkit appropriate for the web. The result has been the Eclipse Remote Application Platform (RAP), which combines the qooxdoo Ajax library with the SWT API. Like other Java Ajax projects (such as Echo2, Vaadin and Google Web Toolkit), the usage of the SWT API allows developing applications quickly for the web in much the same way as for the desktop.

The cummerbund originated in Persia and was adopted by British military officers in colonial India, where they saw it worn by sepoys (Indian soldiers) of the British Indian Army. It was adopted as an alternative to the waistcoat, and later spread to civilian use. The modern use of the cummerbund to Europeans is as a component of traditional black tie and white tie events. Etymology The word cummerbund is the Anglicized form of Hindustani kamarband (Hindustani: ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§∞‡§¨‡§Ç‡§¶; ), which is inturn from Persian (). It entered English vocabulary in 1616 from India. It is a combination of the words kamar meaning 'waist' and band meaning 'strap' or 'lacing'. The 'waist-band' was a sash accessory worn by Indian men for many occasions. The word cummerband (see below), and less commonly the German spelling (a Germanized spelling variation of the English word), are often used synonymously with cummerbund in English. Description The form of the cummerbund is a wide band around the waist, and its origin as part of black tie determined the acceptable colours. Once it was adopted as civilian dress, beginning as a largely summer option with informal dinner jackets, such as Burmese fawn and white, it was restricted to the narrow range of colours which accompany black tie. These were predominantly black, sometimes midnight blue to match the trousers, and occasionally maroon (the normal hue for coloured accessories). The pleats face up because they were originally used to hold ticket stubs and similar items,Bridges, John (2008). How to be a Gentleman: A Timely Guide to Timeless Manners Nashville, TN: Thomas Nelson. explaining the slang name 'crumb- catcher'. However, the cummerbunds worn as part of the US Army Blue Mess and Blue Evening Mess uniforms are worn with the pleats down, as prescribed by Army Regulation 670‚Äì1 Chapter 24 Section 10(b). The US Navy Uniform Regulations NAVPERS 15665 stipulate the cummerbund be worn with the pleats up for the Navy Dinner Dress Jacket. The contemporary use of the cummerbund is purely aesthetic, providing a transition between the shirt and the waistband.. The fastening is a ribbon around the back, tied or held shut by a buckle or velcro. In contemporary use, it is now common to see coloured bow ties and cummerbands, often matching, but this is considered non-traditional. They have also expanded in less formal situations into use with components of white tie, particularly by musicians, who sometimes wear a white cummerbund instead of the traditional piqu√© waistcoat..  Military cummerbunds  The cummerbund of the French Foreign Legion is blue. The units of the French Army of Africa (such as the Zouaves or the Chasseurs d'Afrique) wore cummerbunds of 2 different colours: blue for European soldiers and red for Native recruits. Some current French regiments, related to the French colonial history, still retain cummerbunds as part of their full dress uniform (notably the French Foreign Legion and the Spahis). Similar to the cummerbund, a cummerband is an accessory to the dress uniform used extensively in modern South Asian armies including Indian Army and Bangladesh Army and others. It is generally worn during ceremonial parades and dinners. The colour or combination of colours varies widely according to regiment or corps. Unlike the civilian cummerbund, a leather belt is worn above this cloth piece and one end hangs free displaying an ornamental fringe.  Athletic cummerbunds  During the 19th and early 20th centuries, cotton cummerbunds were commonly worn by athletes participating in gymnastic and/or combat sport training and competition.  Cummerbunds in scuba diving  A cummerbund is also an informal word used in scuba diving to mean a wide waistband either on a buoyancy control device designed to provide more comfort to the user than a standard waistband and usually made of a stout fabric backed with velcro fastenings, or on a two- piece dry suit where a flexible rubber waistband helps to maintain a watertight seal between the jacket and the pants of the suit.

Vlaho Bukovac (; ; 4 July 1855 ‚Äì 23 April 1922) was a Croatian painter. His life and work were eclectic, for the artist pursued his career in a variety of locales and his style changed greatly over the course of that career. He is probably best known for his 1887 nude Une fleur (A Flower), which he created during his French period and which received attention in various reviews and publications during his lifetime. Biography Bukovac's home in Cavtat Bukovac was born as Biagio Faggioni in the town of Cavtat south of Dubrovnik in Dalmatia. His father was an Italian from Genoa, while his mother was of Croatian descent.Igor Zidic, Vlaho Bukovac (Vecernji List) He received his artistic education in Paris where he was sent by the patron (Knez) Medo Puciƒá. His small studies and sketches delighted his professor, the well-known Alexandre Cabanel, and Bukovac became a student at the prestigious √âcole des Beaux-Arts. He died in Prague. Dubrovnik-based Serb trader Petar Mariƒá helped Bukovac financially during his schooling. Bukovac later painted a portrait of him and his family. The young Vlaho Bukovac. Early career Bukovac began his career in France. He painted in a \\"sugary\\" realistic style, his fashionable paintings achieved great success at the Paris Salon. During his sojourn in France, he traveled to England and the Dalmatian coast, where he was born. His travels also included voyages to the Black Sea, South (Chile and Peru), and North America. He learnt English when living in America as a teenager and, from the mid-1880s to the First World War, regularly visited England, where many of his most popular pictures were sold by the London art dealers, Vicars Bros. They included his large religious piece, Suffer the Little Children to Come to Me, and three nude subjects, The White Slave, Potiphar‚Äôs Wife and Adam and Eve. In Britain, he painted portraits of Vicars‚Äôs clients, including his best patrons Samson Fox of Harrogate and Richard LeDoux of Liverpool. Samson Fox had bought Suffer the Little Children to Come to Me, exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1888, which was later presented to St Robert's church in Harrogate. Zagreb HNK in Zagreb Bukovac became a significant representative of fine arts in Zagreb, Croatia from 1893-97, bringing with him the spirit of French art. These new directives are most evident in his landscapes. He then began using a palette of lively and lighter colors using liberated strokes, soft rendering and the introduction of light on the painting canvas. In his time in Zagreb, he became a leader at many important cultural and artistic events. He helped initiate the construction of the Art Pavilion, and organized the first artistic exhibition in the Academy Palace in 1893. Due to conflict with Izidor Kr≈°njavi and his great sensitivity, he withdrew to his native Cavtat where he stayed from 1898 to 1902. Upon his return to Prague he was appointed associate professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Prague in 1903. Pedagogy His departure from Prague resulted in a complete change of personality for Bukovac. He felt satisfaction and enthusiasm in Zagreb that he had not felt in a while, and began to dedicate all of his energy to his new students, one of which was noted Croatian painter Mirko Raƒçki. It was in this time he introduced pointillism to the Prague Academy, and earned his historical reputation as an excellent pedagogue. In Zagreb, he is probably best known as the painter of the theatre curtain in the Croatian National Theatre, \\"Croatian National Revival\\". Style and influences Besides being an artist who followed the established canons dictated by the Salon and the general public, he followed his own inner impulses of artistic creation. Liberated artistic expression, which was called Impressionism, developed in the spirit of the artists who kept gathering in modernism-oriented marginal galleries in Paris in the 1870s. He knew the spirit of academism and, on the other hand, he felt the spirit of Impressionistic freedom. Having accepted modern principles, Bukovac painted casual pictures, using liberated strokes of the brush, in the pointillist technique. Auction records Vlaho's painting \\"Une fleur\\" sold at Bonhams in London on 14 June 2006 for ¬£100,800.00, including the auction premium.

The ballata was one of the most prominent secular musical forms during the trecento, the period often known as the Italian ars nova. Ballate are sung at the end of each day of Boccaccio's Decameron (only one musical setting of these poems, by Lorenzo da Firenze, survives). Early ballate, such as those found in the Rossi Codex are monophonic. Later, ballate are found for two or three voices. The most notable composer of ballate is Francesco Landini, who composed in the second half of the 14th century.

It was made notable by the 1942 children's book The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge by Hildegarde Swift, illustrated by Lynd Ward. The lighthouse stands on Jeffrey's Hook, a small point of land that supports the base of the eastern pier of the bridge, which connects Washington Heights, Manhattan, to Fort Lee, New Jersey. History The first attempt to reduce Hudson River traffic accidents at Jeffrey's Hook was a red pole which was hung out over the river.New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. Historic plaque on the lighthouse A 10 candle-power light was added to the pole in 1889 to help warn the increasing river traffic away from the spit of land at night. The land around Jeffrey's Hook was acquired by the city in 1896, and later become Fort Washington Park. The current structure was built as the North Hook Beacon at Sandy Hook, New Jersey, where it stood until 1917, when it became obsolete. It was reconstructed at its current location in 1921 by the United States Lighthouse Establishment as part of a project to improve Hudson River navigational aids, and originally had a battery-powered lamp and a fog bell. It was operated by a part-time lighthouse keeper. Construction on the George Washington Bridge, immediately above the lighthouse, started in 1927. When the George Washington Bridge was completed in 1931, the lighthouse was considered to be obsoleted by the bridge's navigational lights, and the Coast Guard decommissioned it and put out its light in 1948, with the intention of auctioning it off. The proposed dismantling of the lighthouse resulted in a public outcry, largely from children who were fans of the 1942 children's book, The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge, by Hildegarde Swift., p.213 This led to the Coast Guard deeding the lighthouse to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation on July 23, 1951. The lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as \\"Jeffrey's Hook Lighthouse\\" in 1979, and was designated a New York City Landmark in 1991. In 2002, it was relighted by the city. Access Public access to the lighthouse is by the Hudson River Greenway, reachable north of the George Washington Bridge by a footbridge across the Henry Hudson Parkway at West 182nd Street and Riverside Drive, and south of the bridge by a footbridge at West 158th Street. The northern path is very steep immediately north of the bridge, while the southern path is flat. There is also a very obscure pedestrian underpass at Riverside Drive parallel to 177th Street, just south of the George Washington Bridge. It empties out on the other side of the Henry Hudson Parkway and it's a dirth path down to the lighthouse. Tours of the lighthouse are given on an infrequent basis, arranged by the Parks Department's Urban Park Rangers, especially on the Little Red Lighthouse Festival day in late- September and Open House New York day in October. The Little Red Lighthouse and the Great Gray Bridge The George Washington Bridge and the Little Red Lighthouse (2011) Published in 1942, this children's book uses the story of the building of the George Washington Bridge next to the small lighthouse to affirm the idea that even the small are important. The book begins by introducing the lighthouse. Every night a man climbs up to the top of the lighthouse and uses some keys to turn on its flashing light, allowing it to do its job of warning the boats on the busy Hudson River of the rocks nearby. When there is fog, the man additionally turns on the lighthouse's fog bell. The lighthouse is pleased with and proud of its important job.\\"Little Red Lighthouse\\" , Washington Heights & Inwood Online, NYC Dept. of Parks & Recreation, August 2001, accessed February 27, 2012 The 2002 edition is In the middle section of the book, the lighthouse watches, mystified, as men build a great gray bridge right next to it. When the bridge is finished, it towers above the lighthouse, making it now feel very small and unimportant. Then one night, a light begins to flash atop the bridge's tower, and the lighthouse becomes convinced that it is no longer needed. Even worse, as the night continues on, the man does not come to activate the lighthouse, and it fears it truly will never shine again. Meanwhile, a storm whips up on the river and a thick fog clutches at the boats, but none of them can see the flashing light high atop the bridge, and without the lighthouse's light or bell, the \\"fat black tug\\" crashes upon the rocks nearby. The bridge calls to the lighthouse saying that its light is for aircraft, and reassures it that it is still needed, \\"each to his own place.\\" The man finally arrives, in a rush and complaining about his being late was due to some boys stealing his keys. The lighthouse resumes its job, warning the boats throughout the storm and fog, and glad it still has work to do. Though it now knows that it is small, it is still very proud. The book ends by encouraging the reader to go to Riverside Drive in New York City and \\"see for yourself\\" the lighthouse next to the bridge. The \\"great gray bridge\\" is clearly the George Washington Bridge, though it is not named in the book.

Ball Hall, Keuka College, New York Entrance to Keuka College Point Neamo and the Keuka Lake front at Keuka College Norton Chapel, Keuka College History Keuka College was founded in 1890 by George Harvey Ball (1819-1907) who envisioned a college that would provide a high-level education to all deserving students, regardless of economic background.\\"History of Keuka College.\\" Keuka College. N.p., 2011. Web. 4 Dec 2011. Peter Eisenstadt and Laura-Eve Moss, eds., The Encyclopedia of New York State (Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press, 2005), p.835. The first academic building was dedicated on August 14, 1890. In an article published the next day, The New York Times noted that the hall was built on \\"one of the most beautiful locations on the Keuka Lake,\\" and that it was \\"a firm-looking building, four stories in height, of brick and stone.\\" The freshman class in Fall 1890 consisted of eighty students.\\"Keuka College Dedicated.\\" The New York Times. 15 August 1890. The college faced financial troubles and decided to suspend active instruction in 1915. In 1919, Arthur H. Norton (after whom the Norton Chapel is named) was chosen as the President of Keuka and worked to revitalize the college. Under Norton, who would serve as president for the next 16 years, Keuka resumed instruction in 1921 as Keuka College for Women. During this trying time (1919-1921), Norton personally wrote more than 3,000 letters, published and mailed at least 10,000 pamphlets, made 66 speeches, and surveyed 76 colleges in order to advance Keuka's cause. Dr. Gertrude Martin, former dean of women at Cornell University, became a Keuka trustee and advised the now women's collegePhilip A. Africa, Keuka College: A History (Valley Forge, PA: Judson Press, 1974), pp.99-113. The Ball Brothers‚Äîfounders of what would become the Ball Corporation, a S&P; 500 company, and benefactors of Ball State University‚Äîwere among the key supporters of Keuka at this time. Years earlier, with their father in poor health, the young Ball brothers \\"found a friend and confidant in their uncle,\\" George Harvey Ball. When the Ball brothers' mother, Lucius Styles Ball, died, Uncle George provided financial support and some measure of stability to the young Ball brothers. George Harvey Ball also provided his nephews with funds that helped launch their successful enterprise.Anthony O. Edmonds and E. Bruce Geelhoed, Ball State University: An Interpretive History (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2001), p.47.\\"Our History,\\" Ball Corporation official website. http://www.ball.com/history/ May 2013 The Ball brothers expressed their gratitude to their uncle by supporting Keuka College, donating land and providing funds. In recognition of this, the first academic building was renamed Ball Hall (Ball Memorial Hall) in 1921 after founder and first President George Harvey Ball and the Ball BrothersPhilip A. Africa, Keuka College: A History (Valley Forge, PA: Judson Press, 1974), pp.114-115. The Ball Family also supported Hillsdale College in Michigan.Anthony O. Edmonds and E. Bruce Geelhoed, Ball State University: An Interpretive History (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 2001), p.51 In 1924, Hegeman Hall and Richardson Hall (later renamed Harrington Hall) were built. Both of these buildings remain key buildings on campus today, flanking Ball Hall. During World War II, Keuka College expanded its nursing program in order to provide professionally trained nurses for the war effort, due in no small part to the personal correspondence between Keuka President J. Hillis Miller and the First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, who visited the college on February 16, 1938.\\"Education, History, Summer 2010,\\" Life in the Finger Lakes Keuka's emphasis on experiential learning meant that it had a nursing program combining \\"academic study in the classroom and clinical work at the hospital.\\" Charles R.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered the baccalaureate address at the college and received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters. Since 2017, two busts featuring Roosevelt and King have commemorated their visits; these busts were funded by Christine and Donald Wertman and sculpted by the college's own Professor Emeritus of Art, Dr. Dexter Benedict.\\"Sculptures of Rev.

Since then, enrollment has increased to close to 2,000 students . In the late 2000s, with the help of donations from alumni and friends of the college, the original building, Ball Hall, was restored. The three-year renovation of the historical centerpiece of the campus received a Citation Award from the American Institute for Architects-Central New York (AIA CNY) in 2008.\\"AIA CNY Chapter 2008 Design Awards Photos,\\" American Institute for Architects-Central New York (AIACNY). \\"Ball Hall,\\" Council of Independent Colleges Historical Campus Architecture Project.

Aug 16, 2016  Field Period  In 1942, Edith Estey, a 1933 Keuka graduate and administrator, created the Field Period program, which continues to be a major component of a Keuka College education as administered through the Center for Experiential Learning. During a Field Period, each Keuka student is required to spend 140 hours per year (or approximately one month) in a self-directed learning experience. This can involve a work internship, a community service project, spiritual exploration, personal development, cross-cultural diversity exploration, or a group cultural experience to another city or country. The student is graded on a pass and fail basis with the potential to earn three credits. The Field Period can be completed over summer break or winter break, as students have the month of January off. Students design a learning contract with the site of their choice that outlines learning goals and objectives that must be met. Each student's site supervisor evaluates the student's work ethic and progress and reports back to Keuka College's Experiential Learning office. Upon completion, students meet with their academic advisors to present unique documentation of the experience and hand in a recap paper and reflective journal. In his book, Cool Colleges: For the Hyper-Intelligent, Self-Directed, Late Blooming, and Just Plain Different, author Donald Asher observes that Keuka College \\"does a fantastic job of tying classroom experience to the real world\\" and \\"has a holistic approach to make an intentional, coherent experience out of all of a student's classroom, activity, internship, and field experiences.\\"Donald Asher, Cool Colleges: For the Hyper-Intelligent, Self-Directed, Late Blooming, and Just Plain Different, 2nd ed.

It held responsibility for a wide portfolio of social services. HRDC was based at a government office facility at Place du Portage IV in Gatineau (formerly downtown Hull, Quebec). History=Inception (1993) HRDC was created in 1993 by Prime Minister Kim Campbell's government in an attempt to decrease the size of the federal cabinet by grouping several departments with similar responsibilities. In the case of HRDC, the former Department of Employment and Immigration formed its nucleus. HRDC's creation was probably the most enduring decision taken by Campbell's short-lived administration. The new department, however was poorly focused and had a wide range of institutional cultures from the merged bureaucracies; it also had one of the larger departmental budgets and a variety of responsibilities ranging from the Unemployment Insurance program to the issuance of Social Insurance Numbers and job training and counselling. Passage of the Department of Human Resources Development Act (1996) Although HRCC was operationally functional since 1993, the Department of Human Resources Development Act was not adopted until An Act to establish the Department of Human Resources Development and to amend and repeal certain related Acts, S.C. 1996, chap. 11. and officially entered into force on when it received Royal Assent and was published in the Canada Gazette.Extract from the Canada Gazette, Part III, vol. 19, n. 1 (Appendix) published on , pages 381 and following. Dissolution (2003) HRDC was dissolved in a December 2003 government reorganization which saw two departments, the Department of Social Development and the Department of Human Resources and Skills Development created in its place. The two departments were re-amalgamated on February 6, 2006, though now named Human Resources and Skills Development Canada. Controversies=Procurement In the late 1990s, HRDC gained public headlines across Canada following numerous poorly thought procurements, notably dozens of server computers using the Unix operating system, this despite the fact that the purchase far exceeded the department's computing requirements. Other problems relating to several incompatible email systems made HRDC a scapegoat for attacks on the government by opposition parties. Poor accounting practices In 2000, HRDC's poor accounting practices were made infamous by the Canadian Alliance when it was claimed that approximately $1 billion (CAD) in employment grants could not be accounted for. Peter Donolo later claimed that this scandal was \\"phony\\" and the true amount unaccounted for was $85,000.

She joined International Labour Organization in May 2004 and was the Special Representative and Director of the International Labour Organization's office to the United Nations until January 2016. Life and career Born in Brantford, Ontario, Stewart was first elected to Parliament in the 1993 election. She was a close friend of Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien, and was soon appointed to the important position of minister of National Revenue and subsequently Minister of Indian Affairs. In 1999, she was moved to the Department of Human Resources Development (HRDC), the government department that has the largest budget. Stewart was widely viewed to have leadership ambitions, and was closely supported by Chr√©tien. These ambitions were put to an end by the so-called \\"billion-dollar boondoggle\\" where ineffective accounting practices at HRDC allegedly left millions of dollars unaccounted for. While the problems at HRDC mostly date from the time of her predecessor, Pierre Pettigrew, Stewart took the brunt of the attack but was also the Minister widely viewed to have cleaned up the mess left behind by her predecessor. She did not resign and according to some, Chr√©tien stood by her throughout the ordeal. She remained minister in charge of HRDC until Paul Martin became Prime Minister on December 12, 2003. She was moved to the backbenches because of her position as a loyalist to the ousted Chr√©tien. She retired from politics on February 13, 2004, to become an Executive Director of the International Labour Organization. In July 2005, she left her job with the ILO to return to Canada and marry businessman Henry Stolp. She later returned to ILO as its Executive Director, residing in New York City. With the announcement that Martin was stepping down as leader of the Liberal Party, a group called \\"Liberals for Jane\\" had hoped to see Stewart seek the party leadership. This was ruled out when Stewart accepted the position of Chief of Staff to acting Leader of the Opposition, Bill Graham. Only weeks later, Stewart stepped down from the post due to family obligations. She was replaced by former cabinet minister Andy Mitchell. From 2006 to May 2007 Stewart was chief negotiator for the province of Ontario in the Caledonia land dispute. In 2008, Jane became the Volunteer Chair for Brant United Way. Stewart comes from a family of politicians. Her father Robert Nixon was leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, while her grandfather was Ontario premier Harry Nixon.

The members of this genus are known as teasel, teazel or teazle. The genus includes about 15 species of tall herbaceous biennial plants (rarely short- lived perennial plants) growing to tall. Dipsacus species are native to Europe, Asia and northern Africa. Etymology The genus name (dipsacus) is derived from the Greek word for thirst (dipsa) and refers to the cup-like formation made where sessile leaves merge at the stem. The name teasel derives from words such as Old English t«£sl, t«£sel; relating to the verb \\"to tease\\" ‚Äì the dried heads of the plant were once used in the textile industry to raise the nap on woolen cloth. Description Teasels are easily identified with their prickly stem and leaves, and the inflorescence of purple, dark pink, lavender or white flowers that form a head on the end of the stem(s). The inflorescence is ovoid, long and broad, with a basal whorl of spiny bracts. The first flowers begin opening in a belt around the middle of the spherical or oval flowerhead, and then open sequentially toward the top and bottom, forming two narrow belts as the flowering progresses. The dried head persists afterwards, with the small () seeds maturing in mid autumn. In rainy weather, some seeds may germinate when still in the seedhead (vivipary). Seedhead of Dipsacus fullonum (common teasel) showing seeds germinating while still in seedhead (vivipary). Carnivory Rain water can collect in the cup-like receptacles that form where sessile leaves join the stem; this structure may perform the function of preventing sap-sucking insects such as aphids from climbing the stem. A 2011 experiment has shown that adding dead insects to these cups increases the seedset of teasels (but not their height), implying partial carnivory. Carnivory in teasels was discussed by Francis Darwin (son of Charles Darwin) in a paper held by the Royal Society.Mentioned in episode of The leaf shape is lanceolate, long and broad, with a row of small spines on the underside of the midrib. As food The seeds are an important winter food resource for some birds, notably the European goldfinch. Teasels are often grown in gardens and encouraged on some nature reserves to attract them. As an invasive species A stand of cut-leaved teasel Teasel is considered an invasive species in the United States. It is known to form a monoculture, capable of crowding out all native plant species, and therefore is discouraged or eliminated within restored open lands and other conservation areas. Two moths useful for biological control were tested in Slovakia in 2003‚Äì2004, including the monophagous Endothenia gentianaeana, but the USDA has not approved either of them for introduction as of February 2018. Instead, the USDA continues to suggest the use of herbicidal chemicals.  Species  Selected Dipsacus species: * Dipsacus ferox ‚Äì spiny teasel * Dipsacus fullonum ‚Äì wild teasel, common teasel, fuller's teasel * Dipsacus japonica ‚Äì Japanese teasel, Chinese teasel * Dipsacus laciniatus ‚Äì cut-leaved teasel * Dipsacus pilosus ‚Äì small teasel * Dipsacus sativus ‚Äì fuller's teasel (cultivated form) * Dipsacus strigosus ‚Äì slim teasel * etc. Cultivation and uses Teasel comb Fuller's teasel (the cultivar group Dipsacus fullonum Sativus Group; syn. D. sativus) historically saw wide use in textile processing, providing a natural comb for cleaning, aligning and raising the nap on fabrics, particularly wool.\\"Teasel\\" . The Oxford English Dictionary. 2nd ed. 1989. The product of the teasing process is called teased wool. It differs from the wild type in having stouter, somewhat recurved spines on the seed heads. The dried flower heads were attached to spindles, wheels, or cylinders, sometimes called teasel frames, to raise the nap on fabrics (that is, to tease the fibres). By the 20th century, teasels had been largely replaced by metal cards, which can be made uniformly and do not require constant replacement as the teasel heads wear. However, some people who weave wool still prefer to use teasels for raising the nap, claiming that the result is better; in particular, if a teasel meets serious resistance in the fabric, it will break, whereas a metal tool will rip the cloth. nap on cloth Teasels are also occasionally grown as ornamental plants, and the dried heads are used in floristry. Teasels have been naturalised in many regions away from their native range, partly due to the import of fuller's teasel for textile processing, and partly by the seed being a contaminant mixed with crop seeds. Common teasel (Dipsacus fullonum) and cut-leaved teasel (Dipsacus laciniatus) have both been observed as invasive species in the United States. Common is more widespread, but cut- leaved is more aggressive. Due to the chemical dipsacus saponin C, Dipsacus asper has medically significant procoagulant properties, likely due to an increase of intracellular calcium, and apoptosis of mitochondria. This presents a considerable risk to the average user but may be beneficial in certain circumstances.  Phytochemistry  Ethanol extracts of Dipsacus asper contain phenolic acids including caffeic acid, 2,6-dihydroxycinnamic acid, vanillic acid, 2‚Ä≤-O-caffeoyl-D-glucopyranoside ester, and caffeoylquinic acid, iridoid glucosides, triterpenoids oleanic acid and akebiasaponin D.

The city is located on the shores of the Arabian Sea opposite Oman. Gwadar was an overseas possession of Oman from 1783 to 1958. It is about southwest of Turbat, while the sister port city of Chabahar in Iran's Sistan and Baluchestan Province is about to the west of Gwadar. For most of its history, Gwadar was a small to medium-sized settlement with an economy largely based on artisanal fishing. The strategic value of its location was first recognized in 1954 when it was identified as a suitable site for a deep water port by the United States Geological Survey at the request of Pakistan while the territory was still under Omani rule.Gwadar port: ‚Äòhistory-making milestones‚Äô -DAWN ‚Äì Business; 14 April 2008 The area's potential to be a major deep water port remained untapped under successive Pakistani governments until 2001, when construction on the first phase of Gwadar Port was initiated. The first phase was inaugurated in 2007 at a total cost of $248 million. The port initially remained underutilized after construction for a variety of reasons, including lack of investment, security concerns, and the Government of Pakistan's failure to transfer land as promised to the port operator, Port of Singapore Authority. In April 2015, Pakistan and China announced their intention to develop the $46 billion China‚ÄìPakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which in turn forms part of China's ambitious One Belt, One Road. Gwadar features heavily in CPEC, and is also envisaged to be the link between the One Belt, One Road and Maritime Silk Road project. $1.153 billion worth of infrastructure projects will be invested into the city as part of CPEC,See list of projects: List of projects $230million for Gwadar Airport, $114m desalination plant, $35m for special economic zone infrastructure, $360m for coal plant, $140m for Eastbay Expressway, $100m for hospital, $130m for breakwaters, $27m for dredging. Sum of figures = $1.153 billion with the aim of linking northern Pakistan and western China to the deep water seaport. The city will also be the site of a floating liquefied natural gas facility that will be built as part of the larger $2.5 billion Gwadar-Nawabshah segment of the Iran‚ÄìPakistan gas pipeline project. In addition to investments directly under the aegis of CPEC in Gwadar city, the China Overseas Port Holding Company in June 2016 began construction on the $2 billion Gwadar Special Economic Zone, which is being modelled on the lines of the Special Economic Zones of China. In September 2016 the Gwadar Development Authority published a request for tenders for the preparation of expropriation and resettlement of Old Town Gwadar.  Etymology  The word \\"Gwadar\\" is a combination of two Balochi words ‚Äì guad meaning wind and dar meaning gateway or door, thus Gwadar means \\"the gate of wind\\".  History = Ancient  The inhabitation of Gwadar, like most areas of Balochistan, appears to be ancient. The area shows inhabitation as early as the Bronze Age with settlements around some of the area's oasis. It is from this settlement pattern that word Makran, the original name of Balochistan, is derived. For a period, it was a region of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. It is believed to have been conquered by the founder of the Persian Empire, Cyrus the Great. The capital of the satrapy of Gedrosia was Pura, which is thought to have been located near the modern Bamp≈´r, in Iranian Balochistan. During the homeward march of Alexander the Great, his admiral, Nearchus, led a fleet along the modern-day Makran coast and recorded that the area was dry, mountainous, and inhabited by the \\"Ichthyophagoi\\" (or \\"fish eaters\\"), an ancient Greek rendering of the ancient Persian phrase \\"Mahi khoran,\\" which has itself become the modern word \\"Makran\\". After the collapse of Alexander's empire the area was ruled by Seleucus Nicator, one of Alexander's generals. The region then came under Mauryan rule around 303 BCE, after Seleucus made peace with Emperor Chandragupta and ceded the territory to the Mauryans.  Omani rule  The region remained on the sidelines of history for a millennium until the Arab- Muslim army of Umar captured Makran in AD 643 and over the intervening (and nearly equivalent) amount of time the area was contested by various powers. This was then followed by almost two centuries of local rule by the various Baloch tribes. The city was visited by Ottoman Admiral Seydi Ali Reis in the 1550s and mentioned in his book Mirat ul Memalik (The Mirror of Countries), 1557. According to Seydi Ali Reis, the inhabitants of Gwadar were Baloch and their chief was Malik Jelaleddin, son of Malik Dinar. In the 15th century the Portuguese conquered parts of India and Oman. They planned to proceed with annexation of the coastal area of Makran. They attacked Gwadar under the leadership of Vasco de Gama, but under the supervision of Commander Mir Ismaheel Baloch, the Portuguese were defeated by the Baloch. A few times the Portuguese looted and set the coastal villages on fire, but they failed to capture Gwadar. Cannons of the Portuguese army were found lying near the Central Jail of Gwadar, heirless. The grave of Mir Ismaheel Baloch is situated near the Mountain of Batal Gwadar, constructed by Mir Ismaheel Baloch himself during life. He died in 873 Hijri. By the end of the 16th century, Mughal Emperor Akbar the Great conquered the city along with all of Balochistan after the Battle of Sehwan. It remained under Mughal control until early 18th century. In 1783, the Khan of Kalat Mir Noori Naseer Khan Baloch granted suzerainty over Gwadar to Taimur Sultan, the defeated ruler of Muscat. When the sultan subsequently retook Muscat, he was to continue his rule in Gwadar by appointing a wali (or \\"governor\\"). This wali was then ordered to subjugate the nearby coastal town of Chabahar (now in Iran). The Gwadar fort was built during Omani rule, whilst telegraph lines were later extended into the town courtesy of the British. In the middle of the 18th century, Mir Noori Naseer Khan Baloch captured Gwadar and its surrounding areas after defeating the Gichki Baloch tribe and included it in the Kalat Khanate. However, realizing that maintaining control of the area will be difficult without the support of the Gichkis, Mir Nasir entered into an agreement with the local Gichki Chief, which allowed the Gichkis to maintain administrative control of the area, in return for furnishing half the collected revenues to Kalat, this arrangement continued till 1783. When Saiad Sultan fell out with his brother, the ruler of Muscat, and asked for help, Mir Noori Naseer Khan handed over Gwadar, as part of his share of revenues, to Saiad Sultan for his maintenance with the understanding that the area be returned to Kalat, when Saiad Sultan acquires the throne. Saiad Sultan ascended to the throne of Muscat in 1797 but never returned Gwadar enclave to Kalat. The ensuing struggle between the heirs of the Sultan and Khan of Kalat for possession of Gwadar, allowed the British to intervene. The British after extracting concessions from the Sultan for the use of the area facilitated Muscat to retain Gwadar. Later on, the British claimed that the area was granted to the Sultan by Mir Nasir, however, local accounts and the declassified documents of that time challenge this claim. From 1863 to 1879 Gwadar was the headquarters of a British Assistant Political Agent. Gwadar was a fortnightly port of call for the British India Steamship Navigation Company's steamers and included a combined Post & Telegraph Office. The Sultan of Oman was the sovereign of Gwadar until negotiations led by Prime Minister of Pakistan Feroz Khan Noon and his wife Viqar-un-Nisa Noon resulted in its transfer to the government of Pakistan in the 1950s.  Pakistan  Gwadar Port Gwadar became part of Pakistan by negotiations led by Prime Minister of Pakistan Feroz Khan Noon and his wife Viqar-un-Nisa Noon with the Sultan of Oman. The Sultan of Oman agreed to hand Gwadar over to Pakistan for Rs 5.5 Billion, which was mostly paid by the Aga Khan IV In 1948, Makran acceded to the newly created Dominion of Pakistan and was made a district ‚Äì but Gwadar at that time was not included in Makran. In 1958, Gwadar and its surrounding areas were reverted by Oman to Pakistan by the efforts of Prime Minister of Pakistan Feroz Khan Noon and his wife Viqar-un-Nisa Noon. It was given the status of a Tahsil of Makran district. On 1 July 1977, Makran District was upgraded into a division and was divided into three districts of Turbat (Kech since 1994‚Äì95), Panjgur and Gwadar. Gwadar underwent major development from 2002 to 2007. In 2002, Pakistan's National Highway Authority (NHA) began construction of the 653 km-long Makran Coastal Highway linking Gwadar with Karachi via Pasni and Ormara and onwards with the rest of the National Highways of Pakistan, which was completed in 2004. In 2003, the Gwadar Development Authority was established to oversee the planning and development of Gwadar and Gwadar Industrial Estate Development Authority was established to promote industrial activities in mega port city of Gwadar. In 2004, Pakistan's NHA began construction of the 820-km long M8 motorway linking Gwadar with Ratodero in Sindh province via Turbat, Hoshab, Awaran and Khuzdar and onwards with the rest of the Motorways of Pakistan. In 2006, the Gwadar Development Authority conceived, developed and adopted a 50-year Master Plan for Gwadar. In 2007, the Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan acquired to construct a new greenfield airport, the New Gwadar International Airport , at an estimated cost of US$246 million.  Geography = Topography  Gwadar is located on a narrow and sandy isthmus which connects the foot tall Gwadar Promontory to the Makran coastline. Fishing boats in Gwadar East Bay with the Koh-e-Mehdi Hills in the background Aerial view of the Gwadar peninsula Gwadar is situated on the southwestern Arabian Sea coast of Pakistan in Gwadar District of Balochistan province. Like Ormara further east, Gwadar is situated on a natural hammerhead-shaped tombolo peninsula forming two almost perfect, but naturally curved, semicircular bays on either side. The city is situated on a narrow and sandy isthmus which connects the Pakistani coast to rocky outcroppings in the Arabian sea known as the Gwadar Promontory, or Koh-e- Batil, which reach an elevation of and extend east to west with a breadth of . The wide isthmus upon which Gwadar is located separates the two almost perfect semicircular bays from one another. The western bay is known as the Paddi Zirr, and is generally shallow with an average depth of , and a maximum depth of . To the east of the isthmus is the deepwater Demi Zirr harbor, where the Gwadar Port was built. The area north of the city and Gwadar Promentory is flat and generally barren. The white clay Koh-e-Mehdi (also known as Jabal-e- Mehdi) is a notable exception, and rises sharply from the plans to the northeast of Gwadar. The Koh-e-Mehdi features a two discernible peaks, with heights of , and is approximately wide and features sharp cliffs that drop precipitously into the Arabian Sea. Following an earthquake in September 2013 a small island called Zalzala Jazeera (\\"Earthquake Island\\") formed approximately off the coast.  Population  The population of the city has risen to approximately 85,000 as of 2014. The population of Gwadar is predominantly Baloch.  Climate  Gwadar has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen BWh), characterised by little precipitation and high variation between summer and winter temperatures. Oceanic influence from the cool currents of the Arabian Sea moderates temperatures, resulting in notably cooler summer temperatures compared to areas inland and cities in the Persian Gulf such as Dubai. The Arabian Sea also moderates winter temperatures, resulting in warmer winter nights as compared to inland areas. The mean temperature in the hottest month (June) remains between 31 ¬∞C and 32 ¬∞C. The mean temperature in the coolest month (January) varies from 18 ¬∞C to 19 ¬∞C. The uniformity of temperature is a unique characteristic of the Makran Coastal region. Occasionally, winds moving down the Balochistan plateau bring brief cold spells, otherwise the winter is pleasant. In Gwadar, winters are shorter than summers. Although Gwadar is situated outside the monsoon belt, it receives light monsoon showers in summer (June‚ÄìAugust). However, in winter, Western Disturbance can cause heavy rainfall. Annual rainfall is only 100 mm (3 inches). In June 2010, Gwadar was lashed by Cyclone Phet with record-breaking rains of 372 mm and winds up to .  Administration  Gwadar serves as the headquarters for both the Gwadar District and Gwadar Tehsil. Gwadar Tehsil is administratively subdivided into five union councils.  Neighbourhoods  Gwadar is divided into 5 union councils, which are further subdivided into wards:http://121.52.153.178:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/123456789/14822/Census%201998%20Gwadar.PDF?sequence=1&isAllowed;=y *Gwadar Central **Gazrawan **Komagri **Mohallah Zahoor Shah **Sohrabi **Saleh Muhammad **Usmania *South Gwadar **Kamari **Mohallah Karim Bakhsh **Mohallah Shahdu Band **Mullah Band **Murad Bakhsh **Sarabi **Sheikh Umar **Tobagh *North Gwadar **Lal Baksh **Mohalla Baloch **Mohalla Mir Abdul Ghafoor **Mujahid *Pishukan *Sorbandar  Culture  Gwadar is located across the mouth of the Persian Gulf from the Arabian Peninsula. Gwadar's location and history have given it a unique blend of cultures. The Arabic influence upon Gwadar is strong as a consequence of the Omani era and its close proximity to the Arabian peninsula. The Omani legacy is also evident in the Pakistanis of East African ancestry tracing their lineage to Afro-Arabs and Zanji slaves, who settled in the town during Omani rule. Remnants of Oman era buildings can also be found in the city.  Strategic importance  The port of Gwadar can provide China a Listening Post to Observe the Indian naval activities around the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Aden. Central Asia and South Asia, encompassing the Caspian Region, Central Asian republics, Afghanistan and Iran, and the energy-rich 'lake' called the Caspian Sea, is a significant region because of its huge monetary prospective and geographically vital positioning, which has formed the region as a centre piece in the international arena. Iran has also declared support for the development of Gwadar and its port.  Economy  Much of Gwadar's economy is based on artisanal fishing. Gwadar's economy has, in the past, been dependent mostly on fishing. Its economy, however, is undergoing rapid transformation as a small fishing village is being transformed into a major port city of Pakistan with improved communication links with the rest of Pakistan. In 1993, the Government of Pakistan commenced a feasibility study for the construction of a deep-sea port at Gwadar. On 22 March 2002, the Government of Pakistan began construction of Gwadar Port, a modern deep-sea port, the first phase of which was completed in December 2005 and the second in March 2007. Gwadar Port became fully operational in December 2009. The 1400 km Trans-Afghan Gas Pipeline (TAP) from Turkmenistan to Gwadar (Pakistan), a long-dormant project that would pump Turkmen natural gas to markets in South Asia, may finally be poised to begin at a cost of $3 billion.  Gwadar Free Zone  The construction on a $2 billion 10-square kilometre tax exempt industrial zone began on 20 June 2016. The zone includes a 300MW plant exclusive for the industrial zone.  Gwadar Port  China has a great strategic interest in Gwadar. In 2013, the state-owned China Overseas Port Holdings Limited acquired Gwadar Port. The port is strategically important for China as sixty percent of China's oil comes from the Persian Gulf by ships traveling over in two to three months, confronting pirates, bad weather, political rivals, and other risks up to its only commercial port, Shanghai. Gwadar will reduce the distance to a mere and also serve round the year. China has been instrumental in the design of the project. China is providing approximately 80% of the cost of the port in the shape of grants and soft loans. Over 500 Chinese workers have worked on the project on a 24-hour basis to complete the port setup. There are still a large number of Chinese workers and engineers working on the project. China is setting up a dry port at the Pakistan‚ÄìChina border to take advantage of a shorter route to sea through Gwadar. China paid US$360 million to Pakistan for expansion and an upgrade for all weather trafficability of Karakoram Highway linking Pakistan with China. The contract has been awarded to Frontier Works Organization, who has also started the project. Feasibility and engineering studies to connect China with Gwadar through a pipeline and railway track have already begun. China is heavily dependent on Persian Gulf oil which passes through the Strait of Malacca all the way through the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Once the oil reaches China's east coast ports, it is transported thousands of kilometres inland to western China. The Gwadar port-Karakoram Highway (KKH) route is sometimes said to be safer, cheaper and shorter than transporting the oil by ocean tanker. However, research suggests that transporting oil by roadways from Gwadar to China would be very expensive, would encounter numerous logistical difficulties such as mountainous terrain, earthquakes, disputes with India, and potential terrorist attacks, and would barely make any impact on China's overall energy security, though Pakistan intends to build an oil pipeline to northern Pakistan that may allay much of these concerns. Chinese goods flowing in the opposite direction may be able to find an easier, shorter and secure route to the Middle East. The city is also being developed as an export processing zone for foreign companies to manufacture in Gwadar before exporting to various countries in the region. The Government of Pakistan has committed to providing a base to China in Gwadar with the intention of helping secure the area. Although some analysts claim that China intends to establish a naval presence at Gwadar, others argue that China will be cautious about such a development. A Chinese military presence in Gwadar may provoke a significant reaction from both the United States and India. New Gwadar International Airport Due to the Chinese interest in the Gwadar port, Pakistan believes that Gwadar will become a regional hub, Prime Minister Imran Khan has laid down the foundation stone for the New Gwadar International Airport (NGIAP) at Gwadar on 29 March 2019. New Gwadar international airport is located in Gurandani which is around northeast of Gwadar city in Balochistan province. It is expected to cost $246 million with an area of and it will be able to handle big aircraft such as the A380. The new airport will cater to domestic and international flights and will have open skies policy. It will be a Greenfield airport with a cargo terminal handling capacity of 30,000 tonnes a year. It will have a single runway of length and width of to accommodate wide body aircraft, however an option to build a 2nd runway in future is also feasible.https://www.caapakistan.com.pk/upload/News/pdf/29032019-1.pdf CAA Pakistan has awarded the design and construction contract to the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), It is expected to be completed in 2022.

From his debut at the age of 16, he was known for singing traditional songs a cappella, and has moved on to singing his own songs with techno music accompaniments. He has performed in France as well as internationally and has recorded seven studio and two live albums.  Biography = Childhood and early career  During his childhood, Prigent lived with his father in Le Relecq-Kerhuon and spent his weekends at his grandmother's, in Santec. His father, a primary teacher, raised him speaking French, although he spoke Breton fluently, because he did not see the point in teaching Breton to his son. Denez thus discovered the Breton language at his grandmother's, along with its natural harmony and the tendency of Breton speakers of that time to sing written or improvised songs. While in secondary in Brest he preferred listening to Breton songs on his portable audio player than concentrating on his studies. At age 14, Prigent was taught kan ha diskan by Alain Lecl√®re, himself a former student of Manuel Kerjean, whose other students include Erik Marchand. Two years later, in 1982, he sang with Alain Lecl√®re in festo√π-noz. In the Kan ar Bobl, he won the first prize in kan ha diskan in 1987, the first prize in new singing in 1988 and the first prize in traditional singing in 1990. In 1988, driven by his passion for the Breton language, he became a Breton teacher in Carhaix, during which he was regularly invited in traditional music festivals such as the ' (Nightfalls) and the Festival Interceltique de Lorient. In 1991, the city of Rennes invited him to participate in the \\"Voice of Asia\\" festival due to take place in its newly twinned city of Alma Ata, Kazakhstan. Surprised by this invitation, Prigent wrote a satirical song, \\"Son Alma Ata\\" (later included on Sarac'h) about the incongruity for a Breton singer to be sent to perform in Kazakhstan. This first concert abroad gave him an opportunity to discover the Kazakh people, then integrated into the Soviet Union, and compare its situation to that of the Breton people, integrated into France. Interview with Denez Prigent in the radio program An divskouarn o nijal, aired on Arvorig FM and Radio Kerne, published online by An Tour Tan in December 2003. In 1991, Prigent resigned from his teaching position in order to pursue his artistic career. While collecting the lyrics of traditional songs, he met Eug√©nie Ebrel born Goadec, one of the three Goadec Sisters who revived Breton a cappella singing in the 1960s. She provided him with the lyrics of \\"Ti Eliz Iza\\", and her daughter, Annie Ebrel, decided to join him on stage. In 1992, Prigent sang a cappella during the Transmusicales, in front of an audience unused to this style. He subsequently left the band Daouarn with which he had sung in festo√π-noz. He performed in the Montreux Jazz Festival, the Francofolies, the Midem, the Printemps de Bourges, the Coup de C≈ìur francophone in Quebec, the Mitte Europa festival, the Celtic Connection festival in Scotland, Expo '98 in Lisbonne, and the Eisteddfod festival in Wales.  Ar gouriz koar (1993)  Kan ha diskan singers in fest-noz in Rennes (Yaouank Festival 2015). In 1993, Prigent released his first album Ar gouriz koar (translated The Wax Belt) on Auvidis/Silex. Although the album was, at first, intended for promoting Prigent's songs to festival organizers rather than for being sold to the general audience, its sales approached copies. Most of the songs are traditional Breton folk songs sung a cappella. However, former Storlok members Denez Abernot and Bernez Tangi wrote \\"Plac'h Landelo\\" and \\"Gwerz ar vezhinerien\\", respectively, while Prigent himself wrote \\"Gwerz an aksidan\\". Like all of his subsequent recordings, Ar gouriz koar is sung in the kan ha diskan and gwerz styles. When Prigent failed to receive compensation from Auvidis/Silex for sales of the album, he sued the label and signed with Barclay Records for his subsequent releases. Further sales of Ar gouriz koar were blocked but Auvidis kept the original records, and in 1996 Prigent released a new recording of Ar gouriz koar with Barclay. For this and all subsequent recordings, Prigent uses the Peurunvan unified Breton orthography.  Introduction to electronic music and Me 'zalc ºh ennon ur fulenn aour (1993‚Äì1999)  Denez on stage during Festival de Cornouaille in Quimper. At his wife's request, Prigent attended the first rave party held in Rennes, in 1993, in spite of his negative prejudice. There, he discovered a music that, like Breton music, is primarily meant to support dancing. Noticing that electronic music and Breton music are based on similar rhythms and notes closed to one another, he contemplated using it to accompany his songs. In 1995, Prigent appeared in Dao Dezi. The goal of this project of √âric Mouquet, a member of Deep Forest, and Guilain Joncheray is to treat Breton music in the same way that Deep Forest treated African music, with traditional lyrics and electronic accompaniments. Michel Sanchez, the other member of Deep Forest, also worked on the album, recorded and mixed by Erwin Autrique. Breton singers Arnaud Maisonneuve and Manu Lann Huel also appear on the album, as well as Tri Yann. It is Prigent's first experience combining Breton lyrics and electronic music. Quimper Cathedral, one of the stops of Tro Breizh. Prigent released his second album, Me 'zalc'h ennon ur fulenn aour (I keep in myself a golden spark), in 1997. He wrote all the lyrics except for the traditional song Ar ranno√π that appears in the Barzaz Breiz, and most of the musics, using both traditional instruments and electronic sounds. The subjects of the lyrics are the classical topics of gwerz : injustice, disease, death. E trouz ar g√™r, about the artificial aspects of living in a city, and An hento√π adkavet, about the revival of the Tro Breizh, are his first songs devoted to Brittany, its culture and its relation to nature. To select electronic samples, Prigent contacted Arnaud Rebotini, who granted him access to his collection of discs. Prigent mostly chose jungle sounds, finding that their rhythm, at around 160‚Äì170 bpm, was well adapted to Breton singing. In most cases, Prigent's voice was recorded first and electronic sounds were added afterwards. This combination of ancient singing and modern music is illustrated by Ar ranno√π, one of the oldest known Breton texts, for which Prigent recomposed the traditional tune using electronic sounds. He compared this treatment of singing and music to that of Alan Stivell: Although the extreme difference between his a cappella songs and his new tracks using electronic samples received mixed reviews, Prigent considered that he remained faithful to the arrhythmic, unmeasured aspect of Breton music. Particularly in gwerz, the singer must ensure that the intensity of the event being recounted comes first, and for this purpose, not sing in rhythm, but rather make pauses when appropriate. According to Prigent, a measured gwerz loses the identity of Breton singing, while an electronic accompaniment faithful to the arrhytmic song is perfectly natural. Similarly, he attaches a great importance to the traditional pronunciation of Breton, including the dibril, an alveolar trill used in sung Breton only. It is also essential for him to remain faithful to the writing rules of gwerz, with very long lyrics of which only a part is recorded, and its eternal topics that prevent this genre dating back to the 5th century from going out of fashion. Fidelity to tradition is absolutely not a way of imprisoning himself in his own culture; on the contrary, for Prigent, developing the Breton culture by adapting it to modern technology is a way of opening up to other cultures. With this album, Prigent also affirms his writing style. His verses are mostly octosyllables with, generally, a median caesura. This type of verse is very frequent in Breton, since short words are common, and thus long verses unneeded. He only writes in Breton, a language that, according to Prigent, kept its sacred aspect, contrarily to French. As a consequence, some lyrics remain untranslatable, even for their bilingual author. In 1998, he took part in Alan Simon's Excalibur, la l√©gende des Celtes, with Roger Hodgson (the singer of Supertramp), Angelo Branduardi and Didier Lockwood.  Irvi (2000‚Äì2002)  A path to a tidal island at low tide. In 2000, Denez Prigent released his third album, Irvi. This title is the plural of the word ', i.e. a foam path, meaning a path, only usable at low tide, that links a tidal island to the continent or to another island. The song Hent-eon (foam path) describes the wish of a man from Lesconil to be buried in such a path so that he will be watched over by nature. This idea of a link between two worlds, between life and death, also appears in Daouzek hu√±vre, where seven lost spirits clothed in flesh walk in line on a foam path. Like in Me 'zalc'h ennon ur fulenn aour, Denez Prigent wrote all the lyrics, except those of the traditional song E ti Eliz Iza, on the bonus CD, and most of the musics, again using both traditional instruments and electronic sounds. The latter are more discreet than on the previous album; Irvi thus sounds less jungle and more new age. The main invited musicians are the jazzman Louis Sclavis, the viellist Valentin Clastrier, and the uilleann piper Davy Spillane. For the first time, French lyrics appear on one of Prigent's albums. They are told by Bertrand Cantat on Daouzek hu√±vre, whose structure is reminiscent of the twelve series of Ar ranno√π. The other voice that can be heard on this album is that of Lisa Gerrard, the singer of Dead Can Dance, on Gortoz a ran (I await). This song, the first one in the album, is part of the soundtrack of Black Hawk Down, a film directed by Ridley Scott. Gortoz a ran has garnered recent attention (2016) after being featured in the American adult animated sitcom South Park during the second episode of season 20: 'Skank Hunt.' Another guest, the Bagad Kemper, performs with Denez Prigent on E trouz ar g√™r and Ar sonerien du, a gwerz about the legend of the dark sonneurs, a couple of sonneurs (biniou and bombard) which the gendarmes arrested, mistaking them for thieves for whom they were looking. Both were hanged and buried in Pont-l'Abb√© before their innocence was established. Their graves are, to this day, a location of pilgrimage. In Denez Prigent's version of the legend, the gendarmes kill and hang the musicians in order not to admit to having let the real thieves escape, also insisting on the reputation of debauchery which the conformists gave, at the time, to festive music. This album was nominated for the Victoires de la Musique in 2001. After a series of concerts, Prigent recorded a live album, Live Holl a-gevret !, during the Festival interceltique de Lorient in August 2001, guest-starring the bagad Ro√±sed-Mor of Locoal-Mendon.  Sarac'h (2003)  The urban setting of Rennes, which Denez Prigent sought to leave. The next album, Sarac'h (rustle), was released in 2003. Lisa Gerrard is again invited, as is Yanka Rupkina, the soloist of the Bulgarian State Television Female Vocal Choir, Karen Matheson of Capercaillie, and the Sami singer Mari Boine. Also appearing are the D√≥nal Lunny on the bouzouki, Nabil Khalidi on the oud, and Farhad Bouallagi on the violin. Although this album uses electronic sounds, the music is mostly performed on traditional instruments. The album begins with two traditional songs : An hini a garan, with Lisa Gerrard, and E garnison !, with Louise Ebrel, who had already toured with Prigent. Two previously unreleased songs written in the beginning of Prigent's career are part of the album, Son Alma Ata and Ar gwez-sapin. costarmorican nature to which Denez Prigent returned. Contrarily to the previous albums, Sarac'h contains very personal lyrics, in which the author writes about himself. N'eus forzh‚Ä¶ is about the importance of singing, thanks to which Prigent never loses hope (\\"\\" : my fire always burns). He also resumes a verse already used in E trouz ar g√™r sums up his way of life: \\"n'eus ket un deiz na ganfen ket\\" (there is not a single day during which I would not sing). In Dispi, he expresses his very pessimistic point of view on the Breton language, an essential topic for Prigent, who only sings in Breton and taught this language. He describes his despair about this situation, writing that those who dreamt of a return to harmony between generations linked by the Breton language and culture were insane. The eponymous song alone sums up Prigent's main convictions. It relates his own return to nature, when, used to the never-ending noise of the cars on the highway next to which he lived in Rennes, he decided to buy a house in Lanvellec (C√¥tes d'Armor). He then rediscovered the silence of nature, with the rustle of the wind in the trees in the background. He drew from that the impression, from which he writes the song, that modernisation cuts people from nature and encourages them to stay alone behind their screens. Denez Prigent in 2005. Sarac'h received the best album award of the Breton newspaper, Le T√©l√©gramme de Brest. Gilles Servat, who gave him the award, expressed his admiration for Denez Prigent, who he described as \\"an artist emblematic of the renewal in Breton expression and in the search for new musicalities\\". Since then, Prigent sang on such stages as the big stage of the Vieilles Charrues Festival, Rencontres Trans Musicales in Beijing, the Pal√©o Festival Nyon (Switzerland), the Rozrywki Theater in Poland, the Stimmen Festival (Germany), the antique Roman Theater in Vienna and the theater of Tenerife (Canary Islands). In Paris, he performed at the Stade de France for Saint Patrick's Day, in Bercy Arena, the Bataclan, the Casino de Paris and the Th√©√¢tre de la Ville with guest singers Mari Boine and Karen Matheson as well as Donald Shaw.  An enchanting garden (2012‚Äìpresent)  In summer 2010, he announced to write for a next album.Jambon Fr√©d√©ric, \\"Denez Prigent. L‚Äôaxe reste le chant\\", Le T√©l√©gramme, 15 July 2010 A Best-of album is published in 2011 (Barclay Records). In July, 2011, the Het Lindeboom festival gives to him a blank in front of an audience of 25,000: it has the occasion for him to invite the Hungarian singer Szilvia Bognar, one of the great voices of the Eastern countries, as well as the famous Welsh choir Flint Male Voice Choir. In 2012, he presented a new show, Beajet 'm eus (\\" I travelled \\"). On 7 April 2015, Denez published a new studio album, \\"An enchanting garden - Ul liorzh vurzhudus\\". This album, comprising 12 original songs written by the singer, including one in English, is the result of several years of writing (a hundred gwerzio√π of 80 verses), trips and experiments on stage. The Breton and Celtic themes, unstructured, are interwoven with Slavonic and Armenian (\\"An tri seblant\\"), Greek (\\"Kredi√± 'raen\\"), Andalusian (\\"Ar binio√π skornet\\"), Bossa nova (\\"An tri amourouz\\"), Gypsy or Yiddish (\\"Beajet'm eus\\"), African (\\"An trucher hag an Anko√π\\") for an entirely acoustic music. In songs in Breton, the artist invites to discover the corners of his inner garden and the plurality of his influences. Denez's vocal, \\"enigmatic and inspiring\\" (accompanied by the hang on \\"Before dawn\\"), is like a link between the real and the invisible, supported by the writing of timeless stories, sometimes tragic, satirical or burlesque, such as \\"Pe√±se Nedeleg\\", a Fisel dance describing the shipwreck of a freighter that makes the happiness of the inhabitants for ChristmasJean- Claude Demari, \\"Denez Prigent : le chant des terres\\", RFI, 16 April 2015 or \\"An tri amourouz\\" whose black humor recalls that of Tim Burton. \\"An Old Story\\", in English, couples with \\"Gwechall gozh\\", in breton, two complaints sharing the same story: an innocent woman burnt like witch for having too many companions. Denez and his musicians on biggest stage of Vieilles Charrues Festival in 2016. In November 2015, beatmaker James Digger remixed 4 tracks for an EP.. It appealed to rapper Masta Ace, emblematic figure of Hip Hop, one of the references of Eminem. In exchange, Denez participated in May 2016 to his album \\"The Falling Season\\", under \\"Story of Me\\". His song \\"Gortoz a Ran\\" is used for two minutes in the episode \\"Skank Hunt\\" of the series South Park first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on 21 September 2016. In November 2016, the live album \\"A-unvan gant ar stered - In unison with the stars\\" released, recorded during the tour 2015-2016. On 19 November, after 20 years of absence on fest noz stages, the singer animated the Yaouank Festival in Rennes.  Lyrical influences = Brittany and nature  To Denez Prigent, preserving nature in Brittany is as important as preserving traditions. In An hento√π adkavet, he pays tribute to those who walk around Brittany, singing. At the same time, he regrets the fact that roads, nowadays, are mostly used by cars, leaving little space to walk. Booklet of Me 'zalc'h ennon ur fulenn aour Similarly, in Ar gwez-sapin, a song about land consolidation, he criticises the replacement of deciduous trees, traditionally seen in Brittany, with conifers, because of which landscapes lose their specificity, and draws the same link again: \\"He who is made to forget his culture forgets one day his nature\\". Booklet of Sarac'h, p. 29 The sadness that Denez Prigent feels when he lives in a city is the topic of E trouz ar g√™r, which concludes as the world ends, and in Melezourio√π-glav, in which he finds a new hope in the last remaining natural element: rain. Booklet of Irvi Since he cannot find nature around him, Prigent keeps it in his memory (Kere√±vor). He ends up going back to living in the country, as told in Sarac'h. Hent-eon is also about harmony with nature, this time in death. The narrator wishes to be buried in a foam path to be eternally cradled by the tide, watched over by his real family: rain, birds, wind, the sea. A variation on this conviction is found in Geotenn ar marv, a song against the use of genetically modified organisms in agriculture. To him, there is no meaning in singing in Breton on a land that has lost its nature due to this \\"herb of death\\" sown by \\"those who shamelessly changed that which could not be changed\\". Booklet of Sarac'h, p. 13  Injustice, disease, death  A factory in Cop≈üa MicƒÉ. In the tradition of gwerz, Denez Prigent writes about dramatic events about which he hears during a travel, a conversation, or through medias. The subject of An droug-red is the Ebola epidemic in Zaire. The main character, seeing everyone dying around him, kills an old woman, allegory of the disease. Copsa Mica is about the Sometra factory, representing the metallurgic industry in Cop≈üa MicƒÉ, Romania. Producing large amounts of pollutants, this factory was one of the few employers of the city. As a result, young people had, for a living, to operate the blast furnace that killed them slowly. Gwerz Kiev relates the Holodomor, the famine that struck Ukraine in the 1930s, with casualties estimated to four million.Livret de Sarac'h, pp. 23‚Äì24 Ur fulenn aour is the lament of a young girl sold by her parents to become a prostitute in the Philippines. A variation on this topic is forced marriage, of which the narrator of A-dre√±v va zi is a victim. Given before her thirteenth birthday to a man who makes her a slave, she sheds her tears on the tree she planted, which bears the best fruit in the world. She hanged her husband, her mother-in-law and her parents on that tree. Denez Prigent also covers some better-known topics in international politics. An iliz ruz is a very graphical description of the massacre of people in a church in Nyarubuy√©, Rwanda: \\"they cut their heads off mercilessly / like one reaps wheat in summer\\". Ar chas ruz relates the invasion of Tibet by China, where the \\"red dogs\\" kill not only men, but also their culture. Two songs are devoted to infanticide. Ar wezenn-dar is more specifically about the case of India, where the policy of population decrease favoured the murder, particularly, of girls. In Ar vamm lazherez, a woman kills her first twelve daughters before being killed by the thirteenth, who survives by supernatural means to carry out the revenge.

He co-founded the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) with Chen Duxiu and other early communist activists in July 1921. He was instrumental in building a united front between the CPC and Sun Yat-sen's Nationalist Party in early 1924. During the Northern Expedition, Li was arrested and then executed by the warlord Zhang Zuolin in Beijing in 1927.  Biography = Early life  Li was born into a peasant family in Laoting County, Hebei (previously Zhili) province in 1889. His childhood was miserable. His father died a few months before he was born, and his mother died when he was a baby. At the age of ten, Li married Zhao Renlan, who was nearly six years older; Li's foster grandfather arranged the marriage for Li's protection. He received his traditional education in three village schools in Laoting County for a decade.Tangshanshiweidangshiyanjiushi, Li Dazhao yu guxiang (Li Dazhao and his hometown), Beijing: Zhongyangwenxianchubanshe, 1994, pp. 1-90. He started his modern education at Yongpingfu Middle school in 1905. From 1907 to 1913, he completed his college education at Beiyang College of Law and Politics in Tianjin. From 1914 to 1916, Li enrolled as a student at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan before returning to China in 1916. He did not finish his learning as he was expelled by Waseda due to his long absence from his classes for his active participation in the campaign against Yuan Shikai's imperial endeavors, during which he even returned to Shanghai in early 1916.  Head Librarian and Professor at Peking University  After returning to China, Li served as an editor in Beijing for a few newspapers on which he published numerous articles to promote democracy, freedom, constitutional rule, and national resurgence. As a leading intellectual in the New Culture Movement, he lashed out at China's feudal tradition, criticized the old tyrannical past, and strongly endorsed the representative system. In January 1918, Li was hired by Cai Yuanpei to be the head of the library at Peking University (Beijing University) and a couple of years later he became a professor of politics, history, and economics there. He taught many different courses not only at Beijing University, but also at four other universities in Beijing. He was invited as a speaker by associations, colleges, and other organizations throughout China. At Beijing University, he influenced students during the May Fourth Movement of May 4, 1919; this including Mao Zedong, who worked as an assistant in the library's reading room.Murray, Stuart. The Library: An Illustrated History. New York, NY: Skyhorse Pub, 2009. In a number of ways, \\"Li's urgent calls for democracy, science, and constitutional rule are an essential component of the brilliance of the May Fourth Movement.\\"Patrick Fuliang Shan, ‚ÄúAssessing Li Dazhao‚Äôs Role in the New Cultural Movement,‚Äù in A Century of Student Movements in China: The Mountain Movers, 1919-2019, Rowman Littlefield and Lexington Books, 2020, p. 20. More importantly, Li Dazhao was a prominent leader during the May Fourth Movement; he advised and coached young students in Beijing to take action against the Beiyang government and to protest against the imperialist powers' decision at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 to transfer the former German colonial privileges in Shandong to the Japanese Empire. During this time he published productively on a variety of topics championing new and progressive ideas, and became China's earliest self-converted communist.Patrick Fuliang Shan, ‚ÄúAssessing Li Dazhao‚Äôs Role in the New Cultural Movement,‚Äù ibid, pp. 3-22. Li was the first Chinese intellectual to stress the importance of China's rural society in launching political movements. He was one of the earliest scholars to explore the Bolshevik government in the Soviet Union as a possible model for his own nation. Throughout his life, Li maintained cordial relationship with other New Culture Movement figures such as Hu Shi and Lu Xun, even though they had diverse scholarly opinions and assumed different political stances.  Co- founder of the Communist Party of China  By many accounts, Li was a nationalist and believed that the Chinese nation could enjoy a renaissance by accepting a new culture, by rejuvenating its people, and by remolding its civilization. He viewed the peasants in China as an important player in China's political and social changes. Like other intellectuals of his time, Li's thinking was impacted by diverse elements such as Kropotkin's anarchism. After the May Fourth Movement, he and other intellectuals started to turn to Marxism. The success of the Bolshevik Revolution was a factor in remolding his political views. Later, Li combined his original nationalist thoughts and his newly acquired Marxist views to fashion his political visions for national salvation. Recent studies demonstrate that Li mainly read communism-related works from the Japanese sources which helped deepen his understanding of the communist ideology. Li initiated the Peking Socialist Youth Corps in 1920. He built China's earliest socialist and communist groups in Beijing even before the establishment of the Communist Party of China in Shanghai. Li was unable to attend the party's first national congress in July 1921, but he and Chen Duxiu \\\\- another absentee - were regarded as co-founders of the party. The United Front with Sun Yat-sen's Nationalist Party Under the leadership of Li and Chen, the CPC developed a close relationship with the Soviet controlled Comintern. After the establishment of the CPC, Li and other early communists worked diligently to mobilize Chinese railway and mining workers to fight for their own rights. Directed by the Comintern, Li and Chen joined the Nationalist Party in 1922 and forged a close tie with Sun Yat-sen. Li was elected to the KMT's Central Executive Committee in Guangzhou (Canton) in January 1924, which marked the formal formation of the first united front between the Communist Party and the Nationalist Party. Both parties worked together to fight against their common enemies: the warlord government in Beijing and imperialist powers which dominated many spheres of influence in China. Li visited the Soviet Union in late 1924 and stayed there for months. Upon his return from Russia, he wooed Christian warlord Feng Yuxiang to the Nationalist side, recruited young people into the two political parties, and organized numerous revolutionary activities. He urged Feng Yuxiang to adopt a strategy to fight against Zhang Zuolin from Northwestern China to Henan Province, which was crucial for the success of the Northern Expedition to topple down the warlord regime in Beijing.Yan Zhixin, Li Dazhao he Feng Yuxiang, Beijing: Jiefangjunchubanshe, 1987, p. 202.  Death  Tension between the Comintern and the CPC on one side and the KMT on another led to political intrigue, especially after Sun Yat-sen's death in 1925. In any case, Li was instrumental in the United Front of the two political parties for which he served as its leader in North China. He helped organize anti-government demonstrations, in particular on March 18, 1926 in which government guards fired into the crowd, killing forty-seven people and wounding more than 200. After the March 18 Massacre, Li was put on the Beiyang government's list of the most wanted. He took refuge in the Soviet Embassy in Beijing yet continued to lead political maneuvers in North China to topple the warlord government. Zhu Zhimin, Li Dazhao zhuan (Biography of Li Dazhao), Beijing: Hongqichubanshe, 2009, p. 358. When the United Front collapsed in 1927, Zhang Zuoling of the Fengtian clique ordered a raid on the Embassy, violating diplomatic immunity. Li, his wife and daughter were jailed, but his wife and daughter were released. Zhang ordered Li and nineteen other individuals, both Nationalists and Communists, to be executed by strangulation on April 28, 1927. Legacy Li Dazhao has left an enduring legacy upon modern Chinese history. As a leading intellectual of China's New Cultural Movement, he wrote hundreds of articles to promote democracy, support constitutional government, endorse individual freedom, and called for a national revival. His ideological world might be complex as he had incorporated diverse thoughts.Arif Dirlik, The Origin of Chinese Communism, Oxford University Press, 1989, p. 43. However, his move onto the path of communism was so dramatic that he turned to be China's first communist in the one year span from 1918 to 1919, which was about a year earlier than Chen Duxiu did. Li's thoughts had heavily influenced Mao Zedong, in particular, concerning the role of peasants in China's upcoming revolution. As one of the co-founders of the CPC, Li's key role in decision- making for early communist activities and in bringing forth new theories had significantly impacted the initial stage of the Chinese communist revolution. In a particular sense, Li Dazhao was a special bridge between the first two generations of the communist leadership, as Maurice Meisner remarked that Li Dazhao was the \\"first true leader and its greatest martyr\\" of the Communist Party of China and he \\"represents the link between the older generation of democratically oriented and Western-educated intellectuals of the early phase of the New Cultural Movement (ca. 1915-1919), from whom the first Chinese Marxists emerged, and the new generation of young Communist intellectuals who inherited the party leadership after 1927.\\" Family Spouse: * Zhao Renlan (1884-1933).

A member of the Democratic Party, Stupak served as the U.S. Representative from from 1993 to 2011. Stupak chose not to seek re-election in 2010. He departed Congress in January 2011, and was succeeded by Dan Benishek, a Republican from the Upper Peninsula. Stupak is now a lobbyist with Venable LLP. Early life, education and career Stupak was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and graduated from Gladstone High School in Gladstone, Michigan in 1970. He is an Eagle Scout. He earned his Associate's degree from Northwestern Michigan College, a community college in Traverse City in 1972. He earned his Bachelor's degree in Criminal Justice from Saginaw Valley State University in 1977, graduating magna cum laude, and he earned a J.D. degree from Thomas M. Cooley Law School in Lansing, Michigan in 1981. He worked as an Escanaba police officer in 1972. Stupak later served as a Michigan State Police Trooper from 1973 to 1984 and as a member of C-Street while in Congress. He also practiced law. Michigan legislature In 1988, Stupak was elected a Michigan State Representative, representing Menominee, Delta, and Dickinson counties, defeating two-term Republican Jim Connors. In 1990, Stupak ran for state senator but lost a hotly contested primary to eventual general election winner Don Koivisto. U.S. House of RepresentativesPolitical campaigns In 1992, Stupak ran for the House of Representatives in the 1st District, covering the Upper Peninsula and the northernmost swath of the Lower Peninsula. The district had previously been the 11th, represented by retiring seven-term incumbent Republican Robert William Davis retired. Stupak won the heavily contested Democratic primary, and defeated Republican Philip Ruppe, Davis' predecessor, in the general election. He was the first Democrat to represent this district since 1967, and only the third Democrat to win it in the 20th century. He was easily reelected in 1994 during a bad year for Democrats, becoming the first Democrat in 56 years to be elected to more than one term in the Northern Michigan district. Stupak defeated Republican Don Hooper of Iron River in the 2002, 2004 and 2006 elections, and Republican Tom Casperson In 2008.2008 Official Michigan General Election Results ‚Äì 1st District Representative in Congress On April 9, 2010, Stupak announced that he would not run for re-election, and that he would retire from Congress at the end of his then-current term. Campaign funding Electric utilities and health care professionals were among the top four industries contributing to his campaigns in 2006, 2008 and 2010. Of his top 20 largest contributors throughout his political career, 16 were unions and associations, two were energy companies, one was an insurance company and one was a telecommunications firm.

He cosponsored 157 bills, 5 of which were enacted into law. He voted with the members of his party 96% of the time, and abstained from 5% of the votes. Because of the 1st District's extensive length of Great Lakes shoreline (over 1,600 miles), Stupak was very active on issues related to the protection of the Great Lakes, including opposing sale or diversion of Great Lakes water and drilling for oil and gas under the lakes. Political positions= Financial system  In 2009, Stupak voted against the Dodd‚ÄìFrank Act, which expanded Federal regulation and oversight of the US financial system in the aftermath of the US financial and banking crisis of that year.  Civil liberties  Stupak voted for the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009, which expanded the definition of hate crimes to include crimes motivated by sexual orientation or gender identity.  Health care  Stupak expressed a desire to support the 2009 health care reform bill put forth by President Obama, but wanted restrictions on coverage for abortion. Therefore, Stupak and Republican Congressman Joseph R. Pitts submitted an amendment known as the Stupak‚ÄìPitts Amendment to prohibit such payments. The Stupak‚ÄìPitts Amendment was adopted by the House of Representatives, but a similar pro-life provision was defeated in the Senate version of the legislation (known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act). Stupak announced that he and several other Democratic representatives who supported health reform legislation but opposed abortion would not vote for the final version of the legislation unless the Stupak- Pitts Amendment was included. The ensuing controversy made Stupak \\"perhaps the single most important rank-and-file House member in passing the bill.\\" Abortion-rights advocates held a \\"Stop Stupak\\" rally on Capitol Hill in December 2009. In the ensuing months, Stupak publicly stated that the pressure and opposition he received in regard to his abortion stance on the health reform legislation had caused him to unplug the phone at his house due to \\"obscene phone calls and threats\\" and had made his life a \\"living hell.\\" \\"My staff is overwhelmed and we're accosted basically wherever we go by people who disagree,\\" Stupak added. In March 2010, President Obama and Stupak reached an understanding whereby the President promised to sign an Executive Order barring federal funding of abortion through the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and Stupak and several of his allies promised to withdraw their opposition to the bill. The Pro-life movement accused Stupak of betraying their movement, and the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List revoked an award it had planned to give to him and instead ran $150,000 worth of radio advertisements against him. Stupak was targeted by the Tea Party movement in the wake of his compromise. In April 2010, Stupak announced his intention to retire from Congress, leading conservative groups to point to the political consequences of his compromise as a possible reason for his decision. However, Stupak himself attributed his retirement to the exertion of constant travel back and forth from Washington, D.C. Apartment controversy Stupak rented a room at the C Street Center, a Washington, D.C. facility of The Fellowship (also known as The Family), a Christian fraternal organization.Parnes, Amie (February 2, 2010). \\"C Street Cash Questioned.\\" Politico. Retrieved on March 5, 2010 The Fellowship has been the subject of controversy over its claimed tax status as a church, the ownership of the property and its connection to the Fellowship, and the reportedly subsidized benefits the facility provides to members of Congress. Jeff Sharlet, author of a book about The Fellowship, said, \\"When I lived with The Family at Ivanwald, a house for younger men being groomed for leadership, I was told that Stupak was a regular visitor to the Cedars.\\" The Cedars, according to the Washington Independent, is also owned by The Family and hosts weekly prayer events.

The Stupaks' son Ken graduated from Pepperdine University's School of Law in 2006 and resides in California. Their other son, Bart Jr., committed suicide in May 2000. Congressman Stupak testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee during a 2002 hearing on the safety of Accutane, an acne medication, which he believes contributed to his son's death.

The semi- autobiographical screenplay by Sheridan and his daughters, Naomi and Kirsten, focuses on an immigrant Irish family's struggle to start a new life in New York City, as seen through the eyes of the elder daughter. The film was an Irish, American, and British co-production, and was nominated for three Academy Awards including Best Original Screenplay for the Sheridans, Best Actress for Samantha Morton, and Best Supporting Actor for Djimon Hounsou. Plot In 2002, Johnny and Sarah Sullivan and their daughters Christy and Ariel enter the United States on a tourist visa from Ireland via Canada, where Johnny was working as an actor. The family settles in New York City, in a rundown Hell's Kitchen tenement occupied by drug addicts, transvestites, and a reclusive Nigerian artist/photographer named Mateo Kuamey. Hanging over the family is the death of their five-year-old son Frankie, who died from a brain tumor discovered after a fall down the stairs. The devout Roman Catholic Johnny questions God and has lost any ability to feel true emotions, which has affected his relationship with his family. Christy believes she has been granted three wishes by her dead brother, which she only uses at times of near-dire consequences for the family as they try to survive in New York. After finding the apartment, Sarah gets a job in the local ice cream parlor to support the family while Johnny auditions for any role for which he is suited, with no success. Despite their poverty, the initial joy of being in the United States and the closeness of the family gives them the energy to make the most of what they have, and Christy chronicles the events of their life with a cherished camcorder. As money runs low and the city's temperatures soar, the family dip into savings to go to the movies to see E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (which was rerun in theatres for the 20th anniversary of its release) and enjoy the air conditioning to find respite from the oppressive heat. Tensions between Johnny and Sarah begin to rise with the summer heat. Not helping their financial and emotional strain is the discovery that Sarah is pregnant. Eventually Johnny finds work as a cab driver to augment their income and help pay for the girls' Catholic school tuition. On Halloween, the girls become friendly with Mateo when they knock at his door to trick-or-treat. Despite Johnny's reticence about the somewhat imposing and forbidding man, Sarah invites him to their apartment for dinner, and eventually they learn that the man is sad and lonely because he is dying of AIDS. Later, Mateo falls down a flight of stairs and is knocked unconscious. Christy tries to resuscitate him using CPR, although she is warned away from him by the other residents, who seem to be aware that he is HIV-positive. The man's condition continues to deteriorate as Sarah's fetus develops. The baby is born prematurely and in poor health, and is in need of a blood transfusion. Johnny and Sarah are ultimately nervous not only about the baby's survival chances, but also of the skyrocketing hospital bills that will now need to be paid following the baby's delivery, causing Sarah to have a brief nervous breakdown and blame Johnny for Frankie's death, and tearfully berates him. However, after calming her down, Johnny and Sarah agree to the blood transfusion but without giving the baby \\"bad blood,\\" as using hospital blood banks was the source of Mateo's contraction of HIV. Shortly, it is discovered that Christy has a compatible blood type to donate with, and Mateo's death coincides with the first healthy movements of the infant following a blood transfusion from Christy. After the successful operation, the family is startled to learn that Mateo had settled and paid for their astronomical hospital bill before he had died, upon the discovery that Mateo was in possession of a large trust fund he never spent. They give the newborn baby girl the middle name of Mateo in gratitude and to honor his memory. With the birth of the new baby and the death of Mateo, Johnny finally is able to overcome his lack of emotion and put his grieving for Frankie to rest. He also finally catches a break by getting a small role in A Chorus Line on Broadway. The film ends after a baby shower at the apartment is held for the Sullivan family with many of the apartment tenants present to celebrate, and Christy and the rest of her family overlook the view of the city and look out for Mateo in the night's sky. Cast * Paddy Considine as Johnny Sullivan * Samantha Morton as Sarah Sullivan * Sarah Bolger as Christy Sullivan * Emma Bolger as Ariel Sullivan * Djimon Hounsou as Mateo Kuamey * Merrina Millsapp as Marina, waitress at the \\"Heaven\\" ice cream parlor * Adrian Martinez as Shopkeeper Production The film is dedicated to director/screenwriter Jim Sheridan's brother Frankie, who died at the age of ten. In The Making of in America, a featurette on the DVD release of the film, Sheridan explains Christy and Ariel are based on his daughters (and co- writers) Naomi and Kirsten. He says they wanted to make a film showing how people can learn to overcome their pain and live for the future instead of dwelling on the sadness of the past. Manhattan locations include Hell's Kitchen, Times Square, the Lincoln Tunnel, and 8th Street in the East Village. Interiors were filmed at the Ardmore Studios in County Wicklow in Ireland. The fairground scene was filmed on Parnell Street, Dublin. The soundtrack includes songs performed by The Lovin' Spoonful, Culture Club, The Corrs, The Byrds, Kid Creole and The Coconuts, Evan Olson, and The Langhorns. Release The film premiered at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival. In 2003, it was shown at the Sundance Film Festival, the Boston Irish Film Festival, the Tribeca Film Festival, the Edinburgh Film Festival, the Hamburg Film Festival, the Warsaw Film Festival, the Dinard Festival of British Cinema, and the Austin Film Festival. Box office The film opened in the UK on 31 October 2003, where it earned ¬£284,259 on its opening weekend. It opened in limited release in the US on 26 November. It eventually grossed $15,539,656 in the US and $9,843,255 in foreign markets, for a total worldwide box office of $25,382,911 Critical reception In his review in the New York Times, A. O. Scott called it a \\"modest, touching film\\" and added, \\"Many of [its] elements . . . seem to promise a sticky bath of shameless sentimentality. But instead, thanks to Jim Sheridan's graceful, scrupulously sincere direction and the dry intelligence of his cast, In America is likely to pierce the defenses of all but the most dogmatically cynical viewers . . . Mr. Sheridan is more interested in particular people than in general plights, and what lingers in the mind after you have seen his movies is the rough, radiant individuality of his characters . . . This movie, from moment to moment, feels small, almost anecdotal. It is only afterward that, like Mr. Sheridan's other films, it starts to grow into something at once unassuming and in its own way grand.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed, \\"In America is not unsentimental about its new arrivals (the movie has a warm heart and frankly wants to move us), but it is perceptive about the countless ways in which it is hard to be poor and a stranger in a new land.\\" In the San Francisco Chronicle, Walter Addiego stated, \\"I fought hard against the emotionalism of In America . . . but I lost. There's no questioning the director's ability to wring moving moments from potentially sentimental and decidedly familiar material: the story of penniless immigrants trying to make it in Manhattan. It got to me. I'm still trying to decide whether I was won over or worn down ‚Äî but why not give Sheridan the benefit of the doubt? . . . [He] is clearly drawing on deep personal reserves for this picture, and despite a few sequences when the creative hand seems intrusive, does well by his subject. When you see a director going for that lump-in-the-throat mood, instinct takes over and you want to dig in your heels. Sometimes it's best just to let yourself be swept away.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film three out of a possible four stars, calling it \\"forceful, funny and impassioned\\" and \\"an emotional wipeout\\". In the St. Petersburg Times, Steve Persall graded the film A and added, \\"This is a tearjerker for all the right reasons. Because it's delicately manipulative and the characters are so precisely emotional. And because Sheridan's manner with the material makes crying seem like a cleansing, an affirmation that something so simple and sweet can still move us . . . I loved this unassuming, heartfelt little gem, even if I couldn't stop sobbing for an hour after the show. It's just so beautiful.\\" Claudia Puig of USA Today called it \\"touching, but not cloying, uplifting and hopeful but never sappy and also just plain funny. There is not a false note among the five core performances, nor a false word in Sheridan's script. In America is a classic story of losing and finding faith told with heart, humor and emotional heft.\\" In The Observer, Philip French said, \\"The movie lacks conviction from implausible beginning to sentimental end.\\" Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 89%.

Using a mask, multiple bits in a byte, nibble, word etc. can be set either on, off or inverted from on to off (or vice versa) in a single bitwise operation. Common bitmask functions=Masking bits to \`1\` To turn certain bits on, the bitwise \`OR\` operation can be used, following the principle that \`Y OR 1 = 1\` and \`Y OR 0 = Y\`. Therefore, to make sure a bit is on, \`OR\` can be used with a \`1\`. To leave a bit unchanged, \`OR\` is used with a \`0\`. Example: Masking on the higher nibble (bits 4, 5, 6, 7) the lower nibble (bits 0, 1, 2, 3) unchanged. 10010101 10100101 OR 11110000 11110000 = 11110101 11110101 Masking bits to \`0\` More often in practice bits are \\"masked off\\" (or masked to \`0\`) than \\"masked on\\" (or masked to \`1\`). When a bit is \`AND\`ed with a 0, the result is always 0, i.e. \`Y AND 0 = 0\`. To leave the other bits as they were originally, they can be \`AND\`ed with \`1\`, since \`Y AND 1 = Y\`. Example: Masking off the higher nibble (bits 4, 5, 6, 7) the lower nibble (bits 0, 1, 2, 3) unchanged. 10010101 10100101 AND 00001111 00001111 = 00000101 00000101 Querying the status of a bit It is possible to use bitmasks to easily check the state of individual bits regardless of the other bits. To do this, turning off all the other bits using the bitwise \`AND\` is done as discussed above and the value is compared with \`1\`. If it is equal to \`0\`, then the bit was off, but if the value is any other value, then the bit was on. What makes this convenient is that it is not necessary to figure out what the value actually is, just that it is not \`0\`. Example: Querying the status of the 4th bit 10011101 10010101 AND 00001000 00001000 = 00001000 00000000 Toggling bit values So far the article has covered how to turn bits on and turn bits off, but not both at once. Sometimes it does not really matter what the value is, but it must be made the opposite of what it currently is. This can be achieved using the \`XOR\` (exclusive or) operation. \`XOR\` returns \`1\` if and only if an odd number of bits are \`1\`. Therefore, if two corresponding bits are \`1\`, the result will be a \`0\`, but if only one of them is \`1\`, the result will be \`1\`. Therefore inversion of the values of bits is done by \`XOR\`ing them with a \`1\`. If the original bit was \`1\`, it returns \`1 XOR 1 = 0\`. If the original bit was \`0\` it returns \`0 XOR 1 = 1\`. Also note that \`XOR\` masking is bit-safe, meaning that it will not affect unmasked bits because \`Y XOR 0 = Y\`, just like an \`OR\`. Example: Toggling bit values 10011101 10010101 XOR 00001111 11111111 = 10010010 01101010 To write arbitrary 1s and 0s to a subset of bits, first write 0s to that subset, then set the high bits: register = (register & ~bitmask)  value; Uses of bitmasks A party trick to guess a number from which cards it is printed on uses the bits of the binary representation of the number. In the SVG file, click a card to toggle it  Arguments to functions  In programming languages such as C, bit fields are a useful way to pass a set of named boolean arguments to a function. For example, in the graphics API OpenGL, there is a command, \`glClear()\` which clears the screen or other buffers. It can clear up to four buffers (the color, depth, accumulation, and stencil buffers), so the API authors could have had it take four arguments. But then a call to it would look like glClear(1,1,0,0); // This is not how glClear actually works and would make for unstable code. which is not very descriptive. Instead there are four defined field bits, \`GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT\`, \`GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT\`, \`GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT\`, and \`GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT\` and \`glClear()\` is declared as void glClear(GLbitfield bits); Then a call to the function looks like this glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT  GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT); Internally, a function taking a bitfield like this can use binary \`and\` to extract the individual bits. For example, an implementation of \`glClear()\` might look like: void glClear(GLbitfield bits) { if ((bits & GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) { // Clear color buffer. } if ((bits & GL_DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) { // Clear depth buffer. } if ((bits & GL_ACCUM_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) { // Clear accumulation buffer. } if ((bits & GL_STENCIL_BUFFER_BIT) != 0) { // Clear stencil buffer. } } The advantage to this approach is that function argument overhead is decreased. Since the minimum datum size is one byte, separating the options into separate arguments would be wasting seven bits per argument and would occupy more stack space. Instead, functions typically accept one or more 32-bit integers, with up to 32 option bits in each. While elegant, in the simplest implementation this solution is not type-safe. A \`GLbitfield\` is simply defined to be an \`unsigned int\`, so the compiler would allow a meaningless call to \`glClear(42)\` or even \`glClear(GL_POINTS)\`. In C++ an alternative would be to create a class to encapsulate the set of arguments that glClear could accept and could be cleanly encapsulated in a library. Inverse masks Masks are used with IP addresses in IP ACLs (Access Control Lists) to specify what should be permitted and denied. To configure IP addresses on interfaces, masks start with 255 and have the large values on the left side: for example, IP address 209.165.202.129 with a 255.255.255.224 mask. Masks for IP ACLs are the reverse: for example, mask 0.0.0.255. This is sometimes called an inverse mask or a wildcard mask. When the value of the mask is broken down into binary (0s and 1s), the results determine which address bits are to be considered in processing the traffic. A 0 indicates that the address bits must be considered (exact match); a 1 in the mask is a \\"don't care\\". This table further explains the concept. Mask example: network address (traffic that is to be processed) 10.1.1.0 mask 0.0.0.255 network address (binary) 00001010.00000001.00000001.00000000 mask (binary) 00000000.00000000.00000000.11111111 Based on the binary mask, it can be seen that the first three sets (octets) must match the given binary network address exactly (00001010.00000001.00000001). The last set of numbers is made of \\"don't cares\\" (.11111111). Therefore, all traffic that begins with 10.1.1. matches since the last octet is \\"don't care\\". Therefore, with this mask, network addresses 10.1.1.1 through 10.1.1.255 (10.1.1.x) are processed. Subtract the normal mask from 255.255.255.255 in order to determine the ACL inverse mask. In this example, the inverse mask is determined for network address 172.16.1.0 with a normal mask of 255.255.255.0. 255.255.255.255 - 255.255.255.0 (normal mask) = 0.0.0.255 (inverse mask) ACL equivalents The source/source-wildcard of 0.0.0.0/255.255.255.255 means \\"any\\". The source/wildcard of 10.1.1.2/0.0.0.0 is the same as \\"host 10.1.1.2\\" Image masks Raster graphic sprites (left) and masks (right) In computer graphics, when a given image is intended to be placed over a background, the transparent areas can be specified through a binary mask. This way, for each intended image there are actually two bitmaps: the actual image, in which the unused areas are given a pixel value with all bits set to 0s, and an additional mask, in which the correspondent image areas are given a pixel value of all bits set to 0s and the surrounding areas a value of all bits set to 1s. In the sample at right, black pixels have the all-zero bits and white pixels have the all-one bits. At run time, to put the image on the screen over the background, the program first masks the screen pixel's bits with the image mask at the desired coordinates using the bitwise AND operation. This preserves the background pixels of the transparent areas while resets with zeros the bits of the pixels which will be obscured by the overlapped image. Then, the program renders the image pixel's bits by combining them with the background pixel's bits using the bitwise OR operation. This way, the image pixels are appropriately placed while keeping the background surrounding pixels preserved. The result is a perfect compound of the image over the background. center This technique is used for painting pointing device cursors, in typical 2-D videogames for characters, bullets and so on (the sprites), for GUI icons, and for video titling and other image mixing applications. Although related (due to being used for the same purposes), transparent colors and alpha channels are techniques which do not involve the image pixel mixage by binary masking. Hash tables To create a hashing function for a hash table, often a function is used that has a large domain. To create an index from the output of the function, a modulo can be taken to reduce the size of the domain to match the size of the array; however, it is often faster on many processors to restrict the size of the hash table to powers of two sizes and use a bitmask instead. An example of both modulo and masking in C: #include #include int main(void) { const uint32_t NUM_BUCKETS = 0xFFFFFFFF; // 2^32 const uint32_t MAX_RECORDS = 1<<10; // 2^10 const uint32_t HASH_BITMASK = 0x3FF; // (2^10)-1 char **token_array = NULL; // Handle memory allocation for token_array‚Ä¶ char token[] = \\"some hashable value\\"; uint32_t hashed_token = hash_function(token, strlen(token), NUM_BUCKETS); // Using modulo size_t index = hashed_token % MAX_RECORDS; // OR // Using bitmask size_t index = hashed_token & HASH_BITMASK; *(token_array+index) = token; // Free the memory from token_array ‚Ä¶ return 0; } See also *Affinity mask *Bit field *Bit manipulation *Bitwise operation *Subnetwork *Tagged pointer *umask  References  Category:Binary arithmetic ","title":"Mask (computing)"},{"id":"468317","text":"The Christic Institute was a public interest law firm founded in 1980 by Daniel Sheehan, his wife Sara Nelson, and their partner, William J. Davis, a Jesuit priest, after the successful conclusion of their work on the Silkwood case. Based on the ecumenical teachings of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, and on the lessons they learned from their experience in the Silkwood fight, the Christic Institute combined investigation, litigation, education and organizing into a unique model for social reform in the United States. In 1992 the firm lost its non-profit status after having a federal case dismissed by the court in 1988 and being penalized for filing a \\"frivolous lawsuit\\". The IRS said that the Christic Institute had acted for political reasons. The case was related to journalists injured in relation to the Iran‚ÄìContra Affair. The group was succeeded by a new firm, the Romero Institute. Christic notably represented victims of the nuclear disaster at Three Mile Island; they prosecuted KKK and American Nazi Party members for killing Communist Workers Party demonstrators in the 1979 Greensboro Massacre, as well as police and federal agents whom they said had known about potential violence and had not adequately protected the victims; and they defended Catholic workers providing sanctuary to Salvadoran refugees (American Sanctuary Movement). Its headquarters were in Washington, D.C., with offices in several other major United States cities. The Institute received funding from a nationwide network of grassroots donors, as well as organizations like the New World Foundation. Writing for the Columbia Journalism Review, Chip Berlet described the Christic Institute as \\"something of a rarity among advocacy groups: starting out on the left of the political spectrum, over the years it was drawn into the conspiracy theories woven by the radical right.\\" Three Mile Island, Greensboro Massacre, American Sanctuary Movement In 1979, Daniel Sheehan, Sara Nelson and many of the allies and architects of the Silkwood case gathered in Washington, D.C. to found The Christic Institute. Over the next 12 years, as General Counsel for the Institute, Sheehan helped prosecute some of the most celebrated public interest cases of the time. Christic represented victims of the nuclear disaster at Three Mile Island. They conducted a civil suit, seeking damages from KKK and American Nazi Party (ANP) members for the murder of five civil rights demonstrators in the Greensboro Massacre. In addition, they charged the city, certain police and four Federal agents with having known of the potential for violence and failing to protect the protesters. The jury awarded damages to the plaintiffs against the city, the police department, and the KKK and ANP. The Institute defended Catholic workers providing sanctuary to Salvadoran refugees in the American Sanctuary Movement. The graphic novel Brought to Light, by writers Alan Moore and Joyce Brabner, used material from lawsuits filed by the Christic Institute. Christic Institute poster. Photo courtesy of their successor organization, the Romero Institute. Avirgan v. Hull In 1986, the Christic Institute filed a $24 million civil suit on behalf of journalists Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey stating that various individuals were part of a conspiracy responsible for the La Penca bombing that injured Avirgan. The suit charged the defendants of illegally participating in assassinations, as well as arms and drug trafficking. Among the 30 defendants named were Iran-Contra figures John K. Singlaub, Richard V. Secord, Albert Hakim, and Robert W. Owen; Central Intelligence Agency officials Thomas Clines and Theodore Shackley; Contra leader Adolfo Calero; Medellin cartel leaders Pablo Escobar Gaviria and Jorge Ochoa Vasquez; Costa Rican rancher John Hull; and former mercenary Sam N. Hall. On June 23, 1988, United States federal judge James Lawrence King of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida dismissed the case stating: \\"The plaintiffs have made no showing of existence of genuine issues of material fact with respect to either the bombing at La Penca, the threats made to their news sources or threats made to themselves.\\" According to The New York Times, the case was dismissed by King at least in part due to \\"the fact that the vast majority of the 79 witnesses Mr. Sheehan cites as authorities were either dead, unwilling to testify, fountains of contradictory information or at best one person removed from the facts they were describing.\\" On February 3, 1989, King ordered the Christic Institute to pay $955,000 in attorneys fees and $79,500 in court costs. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the ruling, and the Supreme Court of the United States let the judgment stand by refusing to hear an additional appeal. The fine was levied in accordance with ‚ÄúRule 11‚Äù of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which says that lawyers can be penalized for frivolous lawsuits.Stephen Labaton, ‚ÄúCourts Rethinking Rule Intended to Slow Frivolous Lawsuits‚Äù, New York Times (14 September 1990) In the wake of the dismissal, Christic attorneys and Honey and Avirgan traded accusations over who was to blame for the failure of the case. Avirgan complained that Sheehan had handled matters poorly by chasing unsubstantiated \\"wild allegations\\" and conspiracy theories, rather than paying attention to core factual issues.Public Eye website The Christic Institute was succeeded by the Romero Institute.

Early life A member of an important Phanariote family, he was the second son of Prince Constantine Ypsilantis of Moldavia. He was sent to France where he was educated at a French military school. Union of Moldavia and Wallachia He distinguished himself as a Russian officer in the campaign of 1814. In 1821 he took part in the Wallachian uprising under the leadership of his brother Alexandros, that indirectly benefited the Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia.East, The Union of Moldavia and Wallachia, 1859, p. 8. The Greek War of Independence Sacred Band. A bust of Demetrius Ypsilantis in front of the Ypsilanti Water Tower in Ypsilanti Michigan, United States. After the failure of the uprising in Wallachia, he went to the Morea (Peloponessus), where the Greek War of Independence had just broken out, as representative of Filiki Eteria and his brother. He was one of the most conspicuous of the Phanariote leaders during the early stages of the revolt, though he was much hampered by the local chiefs and by the civilian element headed by Alexandros Mavrokordatos; as a result the organisation of a regular army was slowed and operations were limited.John S. Koliopoulos, Brigands with a Cause - Brigandage and Irredentism in Modern Greece 1821-1912, Clarendon Press Oxford (1987), p. 68. He took part in the sieges of Tripolitsa, Nafplion and the Battle of Dervenakia, securing the Greek dominion in Morea. On 15 January 1822, he was elected president of the legislative assembly. However, due to the failure of his campaign in central Greece, and his failure to obtain a commanding position in the national convention of Astros, he was compelled to retire in 1823. After the landing of Ibrahim at Morea, he took part in the defence of Naplion in the Battle of the Lerna Mills. In 1828, he was appointed in the new established regular army by Ioannis Kapodistrias as commander of the troops in eastern Greece. On 25 September 1829, he successfully compelled Aslan Bey to capitulate at the Pass of Petra (Battle of Petra), thus ending the active operations of the war. Romance He was known for an affair with Manto Mavrogenous, who was a Greek heroine of the Greek War of Independence.

It is named for Trygve Nagell and √âlisabeth Lutz. Definition of the terms Suppose that the equation :y^2 = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c defines a non-singular cubic curve with integer coefficients a, b, c, and let D be the discriminant of the cubic polynomial on the right side: :D = -4a^3c + a^2b^2 + 18abc - 4b^3 - 27c^2. Statement of the theorem If P = (x,y) is a rational point of finite order on C, for the elliptic curve group law, then: *1) x and y are integers *2) either y = 0, in which case P has order two, or else y divides D, which immediately implies that y2 divides D. Generalizations The Nagell‚ÄìLutz theorem generalizes to arbitrary number fields and more general cubic equations.See, for example, Theorem VIII.7.1 of Joseph H. Silverman (1986), \\"The arithmetic of elliptic curves\\", Springer, . For curves over the rationals, the generalization says that, for a nonsingular cubic curve whose Weierstrass form :y^2 +a_1 x y + a_3 y = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_4 x + a_6 has integer coefficients, any rational point P=(x,y) of finite order must have integer coordinates, or else have order 2 and coordinates of the form x=m/4, y=n/8, for m and n integers.

Traditionally made of black silk or sometimes grey, the top hat emerged in Western fashion by the end of 18th century. Although it declined by the time of the counterculture of the 1960s, it remains a formal fashion accessory. A collapsible variant of a top hat, developed in the 19th century, is known as an opera hat. Perhaps inspired by the Early Modern era capotain, higher crowned dark felt hats with wide brims emerged as a country leisurewear fashion along with the Age of Revolution around the 1770s. Around the 1780s, the justaucorps was replaced by the previously casual frocks and dress coats. At the same time, the tricorne and bicorne hats were replaced by what became known as the top hat. By the 1790s, the directoire style dress coat with top hat was widely introduced as citywear for the upper and middle classes in all urban areas of the Western world. The justaucorps was replaced in all but the most formal court affairs. Around the turn of the 19th century, although for a few decades beaver hats were popular, black silk became the standard, sometimes varied by grey ones. While the dress coats were replaced by the frock coat from the 1840s as conventional formal daywear, top hats continued to be worn with frock coats as well as with what became known as formal evening wear white tie. Towards the end of the 19th century, whereas the white tie with black dress coat remained fixed, frock coats were gradually replaced by morning dress, along with top hats. After World War I, the 1920s saw widespread introduction of semi-formal black tie and informal wear suits that were worn with less formal hats such as bowler hats, homburgs, boaters and fedoras respectively, in established society. After World War II, white tie, morning dress and frock coats along with their counterpart, the top hat, started to become confined to high society, politics and international diplomacy. The last United States presidential inaugurations with top hat was the inauguration of John F. Kennedy in 1961. Following the counterculture of the 1960s, its use declined further along with the disuse also of daily informal hats by men. Yet, along with traditional formal wear, the top hat continues to be applicable for the most formal occasions, including weddings and funerals, in addition to certain audiences, balls and horse racing events, such as the Royal Enclosure at Royal Ascot and the Queen's Stand of Epsom Derby. It also remains part of the formal dress of those occupying prominent positions in certain traditional British institutions, such as the Bank of England, certain City stock exchange officials, occasionally at the Law Courts and Lincoln's Inn, judges of the Chancery Division and Queen's Counsel, boy- choristers of King's College Choir, dressage horseback riders, and servants' or doormen's livery. As part of traditional formal wear, in popular culture the top hat has sometimes been associated with the upper class, and used by satirists and social critics as a symbol of capitalism or the world of business, as with the Monopoly Man or Scrooge McDuck. The top hat also forms part of the traditional dress of Uncle Sam, a symbol of the United States, generally striped in red, white and blue. Furthermore, ever since the famous \\"Pulling a Rabbit out of a Hat\\" of Louis Comte in 1814, the top hat remains associated with hat tricks and stage magic costumes. Name The top hat is also known as a beaver hat or silk hat, in reference to its material, as well as casually as chimney pot hat or stove pipe hat.  History  Self portrait (c:a 1770) of Peter Falconet (1741‚Äì1791). One of the earliest depicted prototypes of what became the top hat. In early prototypes, a sash around the crown was closed by a buckle. This was later dropped, in the same way as shoe buckles for male pumps were replaced by bowties around the turn of the 19th century. Carle Vernet's 1796 painting showing two decadent French \\"Incredibles\\" greeting each other, one with what appears to be a top hat. According to fashion historians, the top hat may have descended directly from the sugarloaf hat;Sewell, Charlotte (1983). Clothes in History. Wayland. Ltd. otherwise it is difficult to establish provenance for its creation.Kilgour, Ruth Edwards (1954). A Pageant of Hats Ancient and Modern. Gentlemen began to replace the tricorne with the top hat at the end of the 18th century; a painting by Charles Vernet of 1796, Un Incroyable, shows a French dandy (one of the Incroyables et Merveilleuses) with such a hat. (referenced in Tigersprung: Fashion in Modernity by Ulrich Lehmann) The first silk top hat in England is credited to George Dunnage, a hatter from Middlesex, in 1793. (referenced in Ascot Top Hats) The invention of the top hat is often erroneously credited to a haberdasher named John Hetherington. Within 30 years top hats had become popular with all social classes, with even workmen wearing them. At that time those worn by members of the upper classes were usually made of felted beaver fur; the generic name \\"stuff hat\\" was applied to hats made from various non-fur felts. The hats became part of the uniforms worn by policemen and postmen (to give them the appearance of authority); since these people spent most of their time outdoors, their hats were topped with black oilcloth. 19th century Between the latter part of 18th century and the early part of the 19th century, felted beaver fur was slowly replaced by silk \\"hatter's plush\\", though the silk topper met with resistance from those who preferred the beaver hat. The 1840s and the 1850s saw it reach its most extreme form, with ever-higher crowns and narrow brims. The stovepipe hat was a variety with mostly straight sides, while one with slightly convex sides was called the \\"chimney pot\\". The style most commonly referred to as the stovepipe was popularized in the United States by Abraham Lincoln during his presidency; though it is postulated that he may never have called it stovepipe himself, but merely a silk hat or a plug hat. It is said that Lincoln would keep important letters inside the hat. One of Lincoln's top hats is kept on display at the National Museum of American History in Washington, DC. During the 19th century, the top hat developed from a fashion into a symbol of urban respectability, and this was assured when Prince Albert started wearing them in 1850; the rise in popularity of the silk plush top hat possibly led to a decline in beaver hats, sharply reducing the size of the beaver trapping industry in North America, though it is also postulated that the beaver numbers were also reducing at the same time. Whether it directly affected or was coincidental to the decline of the beaver trade is debatable. James Laver once observed that an assemblage of \\"toppers\\" resembled factory chimneys and thus added to the mood of the industrial era. In England, post-Brummel dandies went in for flared crowns and swooping brims. Their counterparts in France, known as the \\"Incroyables\\", wore top hats of such outlandish dimensions that there was no room for them in overcrowded cloakrooms until the invention of the collapsible top hat. 20th century Until World War I the top hat was maintained as a standard item of formal outdoor wear by upper-class males for both daytime and evening usage. Considerations of convenience and expense meant however that it was increasingly superseded by soft hats for ordinary wear. By the end of World War II, it had become a comparative rarity, though it continued to be worn regularly in certain roles. In Britain these included holders of various positions in the Bank of England and City stockbroking, and boys at some public schools. All the civilian members of the Japanese delegation that signed the Japanese Instrument of Surrender on 2 September 1945, wore top hats, reflecting common diplomatic practice at the time. The top hat persisted in politics and international diplomacy for many years. In the Soviet Union, there was debate as to whether its diplomats should follow the international conventions and wear a top hat. Instead a diplomatic uniform with peaked cap for formal occasions was adopted. Top hats were part of formal wear for U.S. presidential inaugurations for many years. President Dwight D. Eisenhower spurned the hat for his inauguration, but John F. Kennedy, who was accustomed to formal dress, brought it back for his in 1961. Ironically, Kennedy delivered his forceful inaugural address hatless, reinforcing the image of vigor he desired to project, and setting the tone for an active administration to follow. His successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, did not wear a top hat for any part of his inauguration in 1965, and the hat has not been worn since for this purpose.Inaugural traditions Accessed June 17, 2011 In the United Kingdom, the post of Government Broker in the London Stock Exchange that required the wearing of a top hat in the streets of the City of London was abolished by the \\"Big Bang\\" reforms of October 1986. In the British House of Commons, a rule requiring a Member of Parliament who wished to raise a point of order during a division, having to speak seated with a top hat on, was abolished in 1998. Spare top hats were kept in the chamber in case they were needed. The Modernisation Select Committee commented that \\"This particular practice has almost certainly brought the House into greater ridicule than almost any other\\". (p. 8) Although Eton College has long abandoned the top hat as part of its uniform, top hats are still worn by \\"Monitors\\" at Harrow School with their Sunday dress uniform.Harrow School (Uniform) They are worn by male members of the British Royal Family on State occasions as an alternative to military uniform, for instance, in the Carriage Procession at the Diamond Jubilee in 2012. Top hats may also be worn at some horse racing meetings, notably The Derby and Royal Ascot. Top hats are worn at the Tynwald Day ceremony and a few other formal occasions in the Isle of Man. In George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty Four, the top hat features prominently in the propaganda of book's totalitarian regime: \\"These rich men were called capitalists. They were fat, ugly men with wicked faces [...] dressed in a long black coat which was called a frock coat, and a queer, shiny hat shaped like a stovepipe, which was called a top hat. This was the uniform of the capitalists, and no one else was allowed to wear it.\\"George Orwell, Nineteen Eighty Four, Part 1, Chapter 7 File:Winston Churchill verl sst das Geb ude der Admiralt t (1912).jpgWinston Churchill in a frock coat with grey top hat.

The few top hats in the crowd can be distinguished by the shininess of the hat's flat crown File:Lord Grimthorpe.jpgEdward Beckett, 5th Baron Grimthorpe and others at Royal Ascot, 2012  21st century  The modern standard top hat is a hard, black silk hat, with fur now often used. The acceptable colors of hats are much as they have traditionally been, with \\"white\\" hats (which are actually grey), a daytime racing color, worn at the less formal occasions demanding a top hat, such as Royal Ascot, or with a morning suit. In the U.S. top hats are worn widely in coaching, a driven horse discipline, as well as for formal riding to hounds. The collapsible silk opera hat, or crush hat, is still worn on occasions, and black in color if worn with evening wear as part of white tie, and is still made by a few companies, since the materials, satin or grosgrain silk, are still available. The other alternative hat for eveningwear is the normal hard shell. In formal academic dress, the Finnish and Swedish doctoral hat is a variant of the top hat, and remains in use today. The British- American musician Slash has sported a top hat since he was in Guns N' Roses, a look that has become iconic for him. Panic! at the Disco's Brendon Urie is also a frequent wearer of top hats. He has been known to wear them in previous live performances on their Nothing Rhymes with Circus tour and in the music videos, \\"The Ballad of Mona Lisa\\" and \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies\\". The members of the \\"Inner Circle\\" of the Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania Groundhog Club wear top hats on February 2 of every year when they perform the Groundhog Day ceremonies with Punxsutawney Phil. Steampunk culture also incorporates the top hat into accepted headgear choices, though top hats worn in such a context are sometimes made of leather or similar materials and, now and then, even have simulated gears or other adornments secured to them. A top hat, frequently colored red, white and blue, or with stars and stripes similar to those on the American flag, is part of the regular costume of Uncle Sam, a symbol of the United States. For satirists and political cartoonists, the top hat was a convenient symbol of the upper class, business and capitalism. A character wearing a top hat would be instantly recognized by the viewer as a member of the oligarchy. The character Rich Uncle Pennybags in the board game Monopoly, wears a top hat. In addition, a top hat is one of the game's tokens, used by players to mark their position as they progress around the board. =Freemasonry= Masonic Worshipful Master Bill Edgerton wearing his traditional top hat In Freemasonry, as practiced in North American lodges, top hats are often associated with the position of Worshipful Master as he is the only member allowed the privilege of wearing a head covering to signify his leadership within the lodge. However, the Master is not obliged to wear a top hat, and can wear whatever type of hat he deems appropriate for the occasion. This is because there are varying degrees of formality in different Lodges, from formal wear to everyday dress. It is also common for a Worshipful Master to receive top-hat-related trinkets and gifts on either the day of his installation or as a going away present. In other countries, especially in certain systems in Germany, top hats are worn by all members of the lodge. =Judaism= In some synagogues, the president and honorary officers may wear a top hat on Shabbat or the great festivals. The custom of wearing a top hat, or tzylinder in the Yiddish language, originated in 19th-century England, replacing the wig and tricorn hat. The custom became widespread in Europe until The Holocaust. In some traditional Sephardi synagogues, members of the congregation may also wear top hats on special occasions. The custom is said to have started at the Bevis Marks Synagogue in London on a hot day, when the Chazzan was preparing for a service and decided that it was too hot to wear his wig, throwing it out of the window in a fit of bad temper. He then found that his tricorn hat was too big, as it had been made to fit over the wig, and so wore his top hat instead.  Description  John Leech, from: The Comic History of Rome by Gilbert Abbott √† Beckett, a top hat is placed in a deliberate anachronism on the head of the Ancient Roman reformer Tiberius Gracchus, in order to compare him to 19th Century British politicians. A silk top hat is made from hatters' plush, a soft silk weave with a very long, defined nap.Oxford English Dictionary (1989). 2nd. Ed. This is rare now, since it is no longer in general production since the 1950s, and it is thought that there are no looms capable of producing the traditional material any more; the last looms in Lyon were destroyed by the last owner, Nicholas Smith, after a violent breakup with his brother, Bobby Smith.Storey, Nicholas, History of Men's Fashion. pp. 138, 139 The standard covering is now fur plush or melusine as (the London hat merchant) Christys' calls it. A grey flat fur felt top hat is the popular alternative. It is common to see top hats in stiff wool felt and even soft wool though these are not considered on the same level as the silk or fur plush or grey felt varieties. The standard crown shape nowadays is the 'semi-bell crown'; 'full bell crowns' and 'stovepipe' shaped toppers are rarer. Because of the rarity of vintage silk hats, and the expense of modern top hats, the vintage/antique market is very lively, with models in wearable condition typically hard to find; price often varies with size (larger sizes are typically more expensive) and condition. Construction In the past, top hats were made by blocking a single piece of wool or fur felt and then covering the shell with fur plush. Since the invention of silk plush a new method using gossamer was invented and used up to the present day though the older method is more common for toppers made today. A town-weight silk top hat is made by first blocking two pieces of gossamer (or goss for short), which is made of a sheet of cheesecloth that has been coated with a shellac and ammonia solution and left to cure for 5 months on a wooden frame, on a wooden top hat block (which is made of several interconnecting pieces like a puzzle so the block can be removed from the shell, as the opening is narrower than tip of the crown) to form the shell. After the shell has rested for a week in the block, the block is removed and the brim (made of several layers of goss to give it strength) is attached to the crown. The shell is coated with a layer of shellac varnish and also left for a further week. The silk plush is then cut to the correct pattern. The top and side pieces are sewn together; the side piece having an open diagonal seam. It is then eased over the shell carefully and then ironed (the heat of the iron melting the shellac for the plush to stick to it). The upper brim is also covered with a piece of silk plush or with silk petersham (a ribbed silk). The underbrim is covered with merino cloth. After the hat has fully rested, the brim is curled and bound with silk grosgrain ribbon, and a hat band (either silk grosgrain with or without a bow, or a black wool mourning band without a bow) is installed. Finally, the lining and the leather sweatband are carefully hand-stitched in.Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia (1920), Hat, p. 3049 The construction can vary; reinforced toppers sometimes called \\"country-weight\\" included greater layers goss used to provide a strengthened hat that was traditionally suitable for riding and hunting, though it may not always conform to modern safety standards. Opera hat The collapsible Gibus On May 5, 1812, a London hatter called Thomas Francis Dollman patented a design for \\"an elastic round hat\\" supported by ribs and springs. His patent was described as: Some sources have taken this to describe an early folding top hat, although it is not explicitly stated whether Dollman's design was specifically for male or female headgear. Dollman's patent expired in 1825. In France, around 1840, Antoine Gibus's design for a spring-loaded collapsible top-hat proved so popular that hats made to it became known as gibus. They were also often called opera hats, owing to the common practice of storing them in their flattened state under one's seat at the opera. The characteristic snapping sound heard upon opening a gibus suggested a third name, the chapeau claque, \\"claque\\" being the French word for \\"slap\\".

The original screenplay was written by Kramer and Frank Hannah. In old-school gambling parlance, a casino \\"cooler\\" is an unlucky individual, usually a casino employee, whose mere presence at the gambling tables usually results in a streak of bad luck for the other players.  Plot  Unlucky Bernie Lootz (William H. Macy) works at the Shangri-La casino as a \\"cooler\\" - a man with professionally bad luck designed to stop people from winning. A cocktail waitress, Natalie (Maria Bello), takes no notice of Bernie, who is smitten with her. The casino manager, Shelly (Alec Baldwin) prides himself on running a \\"classically\\" Vegas casino and resents the new places that attract a lower clientele. The owners, however, hire an advisor named Larry (Ron Livingston) to help bring in more money with techniques contrary to Shelly's outdated policies. Bernie informs Shelly that he's leaving town in a week. After an encounter during which Bernie rescues Natalie from an aggressive customer, she appears to take an interest in him. They begin dating, but Bernie is apprehensive due to his bad luck. He reveals that he used to be a gambling addict in huge debt to several casinos. Shelly \\"saved\\" him by breaking his kneecap and paying off his debt in exchange for Bernie's work as a cooler for 6 years, which ends at the end of the week. Bernie and Natalie run into his estranged son Mikey and his pregnant wife Charlotte who are scamming a diner by faking labor. Bernie tells Mikey to stop by sometime. Bernie is happy with his relationship and his \\"cooling\\" abilities fade, much to Shelly's chagrin. Mikey and Charlotte come by and Bernie gives them $3000, but Natalie is skeptical of Charlotte's behavior. When Bernie reveals to Natalie he intends to leave Vegas, she says she won't go with him, and Bernie is upset. Now unhappy, his luck turns again and he begins cooling effectively. When he intentionally fails to cool a hot table which is being cheated by Mikey, Shelly takes Mikey and Charlotte upstairs and begins beating them. Bernie promises to pay the $150,000 Mikey was up, but Shelly breaks Mikey's knee and reveals Charlotte's pregnancy was fake anyway. Though distraught, that night, Natalie and Bernie confess their love for one another and Bernie again becomes a good luck charm. Shelly calls Natalie to his office and reminds her that he hired her to date Bernie so he wouldn't leave Vegas, not to fall in love with him, which has made him both happy and lucky. He forces her to leave town abruptly, which hurts Bernie and ruins his luck. She does truly love Bernie, though, and returns, restoring Bernie's luck. Shelly goes to Bernie's motel room and begins packing for Natalie and hits her, cutting her face. After a tense exchange wherein she claims Bernie is the closest thing Shelly has to a friend and he doesn't want him to leave, he simply leaves her there. When Bernie comes home, she reveals Shelly hired her to pretend to like him, but she actually fell for him. Banking on his good luck brought on by Natalie's devotion, Bernie confronts Shelly and calls him a coward with nothing in his life but the casino. Shelly lets him go on the condition he pay back the $150,000, which Bernie tries to win at craps. Bernie leaves and he and Natalie drive away from Vegas. He pulls over and reveals that he won a lot of money, but a cop approaches and readies to kill them. Shelly gets in his car and finds his partner waiting for him.

The Cooler was shown at the Cannes Film Festival, the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, the Toronto International Film Festival, and the Deauville Film Festival, among others, before going into limited release in the United States. During that limited release, The Cooler was primarily shown in Reno, Nevada. In an episode of the Sundance Channel series Anatomy of a Scene, director Wayne Kramer and members of his cast and crew discussed various aspects of The Cooler. In order to show Bernie's evolution from loser to winner, costume designer Kristin M. Burke dressed him in suits and clothes that progressively became better fits. Early in the film, the character resembles a boy dressed in his father's oversized clothing. By the end, Bernie is not only wearing the right size suit, but he has accessorized it with a brightly colored shirt and tie that represent his sunnier disposition. Lighting schemes designed by cinematographer Jim Whitaker also contributed to documenting Bernie's progression. In early scenes, his face is kept in the shadows, but later he is filmed in a spotlight and backlit to make him stand out from everything behind him. The Golden Phoenix Reno, which was already scheduled for a total condominium refurbishment, was used as the interior of the Shangri-La. The Golden Phoenix was finally closed for building rehab in 2006, and since then has been undergoing a conversion to condominiums, which are named The Montage. Golden Phoenix Reno casino employees were used extensively in the filming of The Cooler. The hotel buildings demolished during the closing credits are the Aladdin, the Sands, the Landmark, and the Dunes hotels. The song \\"Almost Like Being in Love\\", used to mark Bernie's transition from mournful sad sack to winner, was written by Frederick Loewe and Alan Jay Lerner for the stage musical Brigadoon. According to the 2006 documentary film This Film Is Not Yet Rated, the MPAA originally rated the film NC-17 because of a glimpse of Maria Bello's pubic hair during a sex scene. An edited version rated R was released in theaters. A director's cut has been broadcast by the Independent Film Channel and Cinemax. The Cooler, budgeted at under $4 million, grossed $8,291,572 in the United States and $2,173,216 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $10,464,788.The Cooler at TheNumbers.com The Cooler earned about $40 million more with DVD and online sales. Critical reception The film received generally positive reviews from critics with considerable praise for Alec Baldwin's performance. Writing for The New York Times, A. O. Scott said, \\"The setting ... is a little tired, and the premise is pretty hokey. Mr. Kramer, rather than trying to discover anything new, is content to recycle familiar characters and story lines. The script ... and the direction are skillful, if occasionally gimmicky ... Luckily this picture is rescued from clich√© by the quality of the acting, and Mr. Kramer wisely gives the actors room to work.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes the film a has a 77% \\"Certified Fresh\\" approval rating based on 173 reviews, with an average rating of 6.71/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"A small movie elevated by superb performances.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 69 out of 100 based on 36 reviews, indicating \\"generally positive reviews\\". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times said the film \\"has a strange way of being broad and twisted at the same time, so that while we surf the surface of the story, unexpected developments are stirring beneath ... This is a movie without gimmicks, hooks or flashy slickness ... The acting is on the money, the writing has substance, the direction knows when to evoke film noir and when ... to get fancy.\\" In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers rated the film 3¬Ω out of a possible four stars and added, \\"Wayne Kramer, who co-wrote the scrappy script with Frank Hannah, makes a potent directing debut and strikes gold with the cast... Top of the line is Baldwin, whose revelatory portrayal of an old Vegas hard-liner in thrall to the town's faded allure is the stuff Oscars are made of. From James Whitaker's seductive camerawork to Mark Isham's lush score, The Cooler places all the smart bets and hits the jackpot.\\" Mark Holcomb of The Village Voice said, \\"Taking a page from the Sin City cinema revisionist's handbook, The Cooler mimics the Vegas insider's perspective of Casino (without Scorsese's fetishistic attention to detail), the seedy/saccharine insouciance of FX's Lucky (devoid of quirky chutzpah), and the couch-potato glitz of NBC's Las Vegas ... What's left never gels as fantasy, drama, or romantic comedy... [the] film never amounts to more than a cute idea stretched to poker-chip thinness.\\" Awards and nominations ;Wins * National Board of Review Award for Best Supporting Actor (Alec Baldwin, winner) * Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture (Maria Bello, winner) * Vancouver Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor (Baldwin, winner) * Dallas-Fort Worth Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor (Baldwin, winner) ;Nominations * Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture (Baldwin, nominee) * Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (Baldwin, nominee) * Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture (Bello, nominee) * Satellite Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama (William H.

While popular speculation ascribed the fires to various causes, including an unknown natural phenomenon, paranormal events or secret military technology, an inquiry by a team of scientific experts in 2004 could not identify a plausible cause of the fires. A separate investigation by the office of prosecutor in 2008 was closed stating that the fires were cases of arson, although no persons responsible nor possible motive nor method for the arson were named by the prosecutor, and the verdict was directly at odds with the investigation by scientific experts in 2004. 2003-4 events Canneto di Caronia is a village in Sicily, home to roughly 150 people. Events began on December 23, 2003, at Antonino Pezzino's home on Via Mare; Pezzino's television reportedly exploded. Similar malfunctions reportedly affected fuse boxes, air conditioners, kitchen appliances, computers, and electronic car door locks. Fires were also said to have struck wedding presents and a piece of furniture. At least one person was said to have observed an unplugged electrical cable ignite while he was directly observing it. On February 9, 2004, two houses on Via Mare burned. In response, Mayor Spinnato issued an order evacuating the 39 residents of Via Mare from their homes to the town's only hotel. ENEL, the Italian power utility, cut power to the town, but fires continued. From January through March, 92 fires were reported. On February 11, an investigation was announced by the local prosecutor. On March 16, fires returned, and investigators reportedly witnessed malfunctions in compasses, electronic car locks, and cell phones. In April, the government formed a interdisciplinary research group, coordinated by Francesco Venerando Mantegna from the Sicilian Protezione Civile. That team reportedly had widespread cooperation from the nation's armed forces, police, as well as utilities. Venerando's team reported anomalous 'electromagnetic activity', unexplained lights, and a helicopter that experienced allegedly-anomalous rotor damage. Scientists from the National Research Institute (CNR), with the support of NASA physicists, were also involved in investigating the events. In June 2004, residents were returned to their homes on Via Mare. Explanations for the events have ranged from the mundane to the paranormal. Public speculation attributed the events to poltergeists, demons, or UFOs. Article on CICAP website citing the Canneto fires In 2007 it was proposed that the phenomena were caused by intermittent electromagnetic emissions.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1567428/Aliens-caused- Sicily-fires-say-officials.html On 24 June 2008, following further investigation by the appointed experts, the case was dismissed by the prosecutor of Mistretta. The conclusion of the prosecutor was that the fires were arson cases, although no responsible persons for the arson were named by the prosecutor. 2014-15 events Mysterious fires returned again in mid-2014. On March 5, 2015 police arrested and charged Giuseppe Pezzino, 26, with arson, conspiracy to commit fraud, and sounding a false alarm in association with the mysterious fires. His father, Antonino Pezzino, has also been implicated. The Italian military police had installed hidden cameras in the streets after the fires started again in July 2014. Video captured about 40 incidents implicating Giuseppe (and occasionally, Antonino). Further evidence was gathered by phone taps.

Smith (born November 5, 1934) is an American politician from the U.S. state of Michigan, who served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from 1993 until 2005, representing from the 7th District of Michigan.  Life and career  Smith was born in Addison, Michigan, where he still lives. He earned a B.A. from Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, in 1957 and an M.S. in Economics from the University of Delaware in 1959. Smith served in the United States Air Force from 1959 to 1961. He was Squadron Commander in the Civil Air Patrol and later an Intelligence Officer. He operates a dairy farm in Addison. Smith served on the Somerset Township board of trustees, 1962 to 1968. He was township supervisor and on the Hillsdale County board of supervisors from 1966 to 1968. He then served as assistant deputy administrator and director of energy in the United States Department of Agriculture between 1972 and 1974. Smith served as a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives from the 41st District from 1979 to 1983. He then served as a member of Michigan Senate from the 19th District from 1983 to 1993. While in the Michigan Senate, he was appointed President Pro Tempore from 1983 to 1990. left Smith ran for Congress in the 7th District in 1992, winning the Republican primary by seven points. His nearest opponent was fellow state senator Joe Schwarz, a considerably more moderate Republican. Smith was the major candidate from the eastern portion of the district, while Schwarz and the others were all from the western portion. The candidates from the western portion split the vote, allowing Smith to win despite getting only 37 percent of the vote. No Democrat even filed for the general election, handing the seat to Smith. He was reelected five times. Smith was a relatively low-profile congressman for most of his career, compiling a reliably conservative voting record despite representing a fairly marginal district. However, Smith gained national attention in 2004 in the controversy over the Medicare Modernization Act. Smith had announced earlier he was not running for reelection later that year, having promised during his initial run to only serve six terms (12 years) in the House. However, he'd endorsed his son, Brad, as his successor. Smith stated that members of the House Republican leadership told him that if he voted for the Medicare bill, business interests would give $100,000 to his son's campaign. When Nick Smith refused to vote for the bill, he was told that his son would never get into Congress. Ultimately, Brad Smith was defeated in the Republican primary by Schwarz, who was elected in November. In March 2004, the House Ethics Committee admonished fellow Representative from Michigan Candice Miller and House Majority Leader Tom DeLay for their involvement in the affair.

He became one of the first settlers and business people in the Huron Tract, located in present-day southwestern Ontario Canada. Van Egmond became an early contractor employed by the Canada Company to construct the original in length road into the new settlement, allowing the entry of settlers for the purchase of company lands and further economic development. He eventually became a supporter of William Lyon Mackenzie, and led a force of armed rebels in their unsuccessful skirmish at Montgomery's Tavern near Toronto, on December 7, 1837, during the Upper Canada Rebellion. Life Anthony van Egmond was born in Groesbeek in the Netherlands, the son of Johannes Arnoldus Gijben and his wife Maria Bloem. When he was twelve years old his father was murdered. Alleged criminal activity forced him to flee to Germany around 1795 where he assumed another identity, which included adoption of a false claim of descent from the Van Egmonds, an aristocratic family of the Netherlands. In 1819, attracted by the prospect of purchasing land from the Holland Land Company, he travelled, via Amsterdam, Liverpool, and Philadelphia, to Indiana, Pennsylvania. The land, which he purchased in 1826, was eventually seized and sold at auction to cover unpaid taxes.  The Canada Company  Huron Tract Purchase area, located in southern Ontario, highlighted in yellow In 1828 he emigrated to Oxford Township East, in Upper Canada, where he purchased 200 acres (809,000 m¬≤) of land from the Canada Company. Because of the establishment of a personal friendship with local company official John Galt, Van Egmond came to the attention of other Canada Company executives and was subsequently employed by the company as the initial primary contractor for road construction in the Huron Tract. Van Egmond was also charged with establishing a series of inns to be positioned at twenty mile (32 km) intervals along the Huron Road, which were to act as nightly stopping and resupplying points for the arriving settlers. Although Van Egmond continued to complete his contractual obligations to the Canada Company, he continually resented that the Company insisted on paying all fees in the form of one-third cash and two-thirds company 'land credits', redeemable in exchange for parcels of land already owned by the company. Van Egmond found himself having to expend his own funds in order to achieve Canada Company development goals. At that time, the land credits he was paid with were only immediately redeemable in cash for a fraction of their stated value, because of the undeveloped condition of the lands involved. Because of this arrangement, by the early 1830s, Van Egmond had personally accumulated of land in the Huron Tract, including located in the central area of what is today the city of Stratford, Ontario. In August 1830, Van Egmond's wife, Marie Susanne Elizabeth Dietz Van Egmond, ceremonially cut and bound the first sheaf of wheat harvested in the Huron Tract, at a gathering on their family farm on the Huron Road, which included local Canada Company officials and other regional businessmen. Van Egmond became increasingly disgruntled at what he perceived as the Canada Company's failure to expend obligated amounts of money from the Huron Tract Improvement Fund for the development of local roads and other infrastructure, as well as at what he believed was the company's disregard for the general well-being of the arriving settlers. It's interesting to note that Van Egmond's views appear to be at least partially vindicated by an uncompleted judicial review conducted by Justice Jonas T.W. Jones in 1840. In his report Jones upheld Van Egmond's position that the Canada Company's practice of paying debts, partially in cash and partially in 'land credits', did not abide with the terms of the company's original purchase agreement, when they acquired the lands from the Crown.  Reform politics  Van Egmond began to voice his concerns by corresponding with William Lyon Mackenzie, a radical reformer who published a newspaper, the Colonial Advocate, in Upper Canada's capital York. In January 1835, Van Egmond organized the Huron Union Society which met in the homes of recent settlers in the region. Its purpose was primarily to agitate for changes to Canada Company's policies and business practices in the Huron District, however their stated aims also included demands for a more responsible government in the province, where control of public revenues would be in the hands of elected, rather than appointed officials. The Society also called for the immediate sale of all remaining Clergy reserves and an end to what they saw as government sponsored monopolies, such as the Canada Company itself. It was also in 1835, that Van Egmond was nominated in the recently created District of Huron as the Reform candidate in an election to be held in 1836 for a seat in the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada in Toronto. He was defeated in that election by Robert Graham Dunlop from Goderich, Ontario, the brother of William \\"Tiger\\" Dunlop .  Rebellion and confinement Frustrated by what he saw as a failure to address important issues on the part of both the Canada Company and the so-called Family Compact he began a period of much more involvement with William Lyon Mackenzie and participation in more extreme forms of politics. It's possible that Mackenzie based his appointment of Van Egmond as military leader for a planned open rebellion to begin at Montgomery's Tavern near Toronto in December 1837, on Van Egmond's possibly exaggerated past claims of having gained actual combat experience in the Napoleonic wars in Europe. It is indicated in sources that on the day of the actual engagement at Montgomery's Tavern, Van Egmond advised William Lyon Mackenzie that their military cause was \\"hopeless\\" and advised him to retreat from the situation. Mackenzie is purported to have threatened Van Egmond's life if he failed to proceed with their plan. After being routed in the engagement by government armed forces, Van Egmond was arrested and confined to a small prison cell in Toronto. Suffering from a possible combination of malnutrition, pneumonia and exposure, Van Egmond became seriously ill in confinement and was transferred to a nearby hospital where he died on January 5, 1838. Subsequent to his death, Van Egmond's substantial real estate holdings, apart from the original family farm, were seized by the colonial government, purportedly as punishment for his participation in the uprising. Van Edgmond is buried at Egmondville Cemetery in Egmondville, Ontario.http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep- reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=15422 The community of Egmondville, now incorporated within the community of Seaforth in the Municipality of Huron East was founded in Van Egmond's honour in 1845, by his eldest son Constant.

Collectively, their organizations are called \\"tribes\\". There are about 38 tribes which range in size from half a dozen to several dozen members. The groups are largely independent, but a pair of umbrella organizations loosely coordinates the Uptown Indians and the Downtown Indians. In addition to Mardi Gras Day, many of the tribes also parade on Saint Joseph's Day (March 19) and the Sunday nearest to Saint Joseph's Day (\\"Super Sunday\\"). Traditionally, these were the only times Mardi Gras Indians were seen in public in full regalia. The New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival began the practice of hiring tribes to appear at the Festival as well. In recent years it has become more common to see Mardi Gras Indians at other festivals and parades in the city. Notwithstanding the popularity of such activities for tourists and residents alike, the phenomenon of the Mardi Gras Indians is said to reflect both a vital musical history and an equally vital attempt to express internal social dynamics. History Chief and members of the \\"Yellow Pocahontas\\" tribe, St. Joseph's Day, 1942 Mardi Gras Indians have been practicing their traditions in New Orleans at least since the mid-19th century, possibly before. The history of the Mardi Gras Indians is shrouded in mystery and folklore. Congo Square Mardi Gras Indian getting ready In 1740, New Orleans' Congo Square was a cultural center for African music and dance.Smith, Michael, and Alan Govenar. Mardi Gras Indians. Gretna: Pelican Pub. Co. 1994. Print. New Orleans was more liberal than many Southern cities, and on Sundays African slaves gathered to sing folk songs, play traditional music, and dance. The lively parties were recounted by a Northern observer as being \\"indescribable... Never will you see gayer countenances, demonstrations of more forgetfulness of the past and the future, and more entire abandonment to the joyous existence to the present movement.\\"Flint, Timothy. Recollections of the Last Ten Years. Boston: Cummings, Hilliard, and Company, 1826. The idea of letting loose and embracing traditional African music and dance is a backbone of the Mardi Gras Indians practice. Native American and African American encounters As a major southern trade port, New Orleans became a cultural melting pot. During the late 1740s and 1750s, many enslaved Africans fled to the bayous of Louisiana where they encountered Native Americans. Years later, after the Civil War, hundreds of freed slaves joined the U.S. Ninth Cavalry Regiment, also known as Buffalo Soldiers. The Buffalo Soldiers fought, killed, forced, and aided the mass removal and relocation of the Plains Indians on the Western Frontier. After returning to New Orleans, many ex-soldiers joined popular Wild West shows, most notably Buffalo Bill's Wild West. The show wintered in New Orleans from 1884 to 1885 and was hailed by the Daily Picayune as \\"the people's choice\\". There was at least one black cowboy in the show, and there were numerous black cowhands.Gaudet, Marcia, and James McDonald. Mardi Gras, gumbo, and zydeco: Readings in Louisiana Culture. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. 2003. Print. On Mardi Gras in 1885, 50 to 60 Plains Indians marched in native dress on the streets of New Orleans. Later that year, it is believed the first Mardi Gras Indian gang was formed; the tribe was named \\"The Creole Wild West\\" and was most likely composed of members of Buffalo Bill's Wild West show, although the \\"Indian gangs\\" might predate their appearance in the City. Suits Mardi Gras Indian suits cost thousands of dollars in materials alone and can weigh upwards of one hundred pounds.Brennan, Jonathan. When Brer Rabbit meets Coyote: African-Native American Literature. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. 2003. Print. A suit usually takes between six and nine months to plan and complete. Each Indian designs and creates his own suit; elaborate bead patches depict meaningful and symbolic scenes.Bragg, Rick. \\"Another Battle of New Orleans: Mardi Gras,\\" New York Times (Feb. 19, 1995). Beads, feathers, and sequins are integral parts of a Mardi Gras Indian suit. Uptown New Orleans tribes tend to have more sculptural and abstract African-inspired suits; downtown tribes have more pictorial suits with heavy Native American influences. The suits are debuted on Super Sunday and rival professional costume designers. Even though men dominate the different tribes, women can become Mardi Gras Indian \\"Queens\\" who make their own costumes and masks. The suits incorporate volume giving the clothing a sculptural sensibility. Darryl Montana, son of the revered Big Chief of the Yellow Pocahontas \\"Hunters\\" tribe, states that the suits each year cost around $5,000 in materials that can include up to 300 yards of down feather trimming. The suits can take up to a year to complete as each artist needs to order materials, design the layout, sew and bead. The beadwork is entirely done by hand and make a great combination of color and texture. Some of the suits are displayed in museums throughout the country Parade formation and protocol Uptown Mardi Gras Indians Encounter on Mardi Gras Day The Mardi Gras Indians play various traditional roles. Many blocks ahead of the Indians are plain clothed informants keeping an eye out for any danger. The procession begins with \\"spyboys,\\" dressed in light \\"running suits\\" that allow them the freedom to move quickly in case of emergency. Next comes the \\"first flag,\\" an ornately dressed Indian carrying a token tribe flag. Closest to the \\"Big Chief\\" is the \\"Wildman\\" who usually carries a symbolic weapon. Finally, there is the \\"Big Chief.\\" The \\"Big Chief\\" decides where to go and which tribes to meet (or ignore). The entire group is followed by percussionists and revelers. During the march, the Indians dance and sing traditional songs particular to their gang. They use hodgepodge languages loosely based on different African dialects. The \\"Big Chief\\" decides where the group will parade; the parade route is different each time. When two tribes come across each other, they either pass by or meet for a symbolic fight. Each tribe lines up and the \\"Big Chiefs\\" taunt each other about their suits and their tribes. The drum beats of the two tribes intertwine, and the face off is complete. Both tribes continue on their way.Gaudet, Marcia, and James McDonald. Mardi Gras, gumbo, and zydeco: Readings in Louisiana Culture. Jackson: University Press of Mississippi. 2003. Print.  Violence  In the early days of the Indians, Mardi Gras was a day of both reveling and bloodshed. \\"Masking\\" and parading was a time to settle grudges. This part of Mardi Gras Indian history is immortalized in James Sugar Boy Crawford's song, \\"Jock O Mo\\" (better known and often covered as \\"Iko Iko\\"), based on their taunting chants. However, in the late 1960s, Allison Montana, \\"Chief of Chiefs\\", fought to end violence between the Mardi Gras Indian Tribes. Print. He said, \\"I was going to make them stop fighting with the gun and the knife and start fighting with the needle and thread.\\" Today, the Mardi Gras Indians are not plagued by violence; instead, they base their fights over the \\"prettiness\\" of their suits.

It started with the Dornier A Libelle I and the Dornier A Libelle II, though the Do 12 was not a continuation, but an entirely new aircraft. The aircraft was amphibious and would carry three to four passengers. It was powered by a single Argus As 10 engine initially, then a Gnome-Rh√¥ne 5Ke Titan engine, mounted above the wing. It first flew in 1932 and went on to be used by the DFS to tow gliders. Design The Do 12 was a high-wing monoplane, of usual Dornier all-metal construction, with a two-spar, trapezoidal wing, whose trailing edge was very strongly rounded at the root. The fuselage was of rectangular cross-section. A storage area was in the nose, where equipment, including anchors, could be kept. Behind it, the open cockpit had two side-by-side seats, with optional dual controls. In the cabin, there were two more seats and a storage area, which could also be fitted with bunks for sleeping. Between the cockpit and cabin were nacelles which accommodated the retracted undercarriage wheels, a first for Dornier, which were lowered or raised manually by a crank. The engine sat on a stand high above the wing, alongside two fuel tanks, in pusher configuration. From the first flight on 23 June 1932, and in the further course of testing, it was obvious that the Argus engine was underpowered, making takeoff distances substantially too long.

It is located on the banks of the Euphrates River. The estimated population in 2003 was 110,000. Currently, Kufa and Najaf are joined into a single urban area that is mostly commonly known to the outside world as 'Najaf'. Along with Samarra, Karbala, Kadhimiya and Najaf, Kufa is one of five Iraqi cities that are of great importance to Shi'ite Muslims. The city was the final capital of the fourth Rashidun Caliph, Ali ibn Abi Talib, and was founded during 639 CE (17 Hijrah) by the second Rashidun Caliph, Umar ibn Al- Khattab. It is also related that Muslims after conquest of Al-Madain were searching for a suitable place for habitation. Likewise others, Salman and Hudhayfa bin al-Yamman were also looking for. After choosing the land, they offered prayers there, thus marking the day of the foundation of Kufa. History The Great Mosque of Kufa, 1915 CE Establishment during Umar's era The Arabs, led by Caliph Umar, conquered Iraq and began ruling Suristan around 637. Umar, who assigned the land of the Jews in Arabia to his warriors, ordered the relocation of the Jews of Khaybar to a strip of land in Kufa, in 640.History of the Jews, Heinrich Graetz, Vol 3. Page 84, Trans. Bella Lowy, London 1892. After the Arab victory against the East Roman Empire at Battle of Yarmouk in 636, Kufa was founded and given its name in 637‚Äì638 CE, about the same time as Basrah. The Companion of the Prophet Sa ªd ibn Abƒ´ Waqqas founded it as an encampment adjacent to the Lakhmid Arab city of Al-Hirah, and incorporated it as a city of seven divisions. Non-Arabs knew the city under alternate names: Hƒ´rah and Aqulah, before the consolidations of  ªAbdu l-MƒÅlik in 691.Tareekh e Tabri, vol 3 page 52. However, in the 640s, the Kufan commons were agitated that Umar's governor was distributing the spoils of war unfairly. In 642  ªUmar summoned Sa ªd to Medina with his accusers. Despite finding Sa'd to be innocent, Umar deposed him to avert ill feelings. At first, Umar appointed Ammar ibn Yasir and secondly Basra's first Governor Ab≈´ M≈´sƒÅ al-Ash ªarƒ´; but the Kufan instigators accepted neither.  ªUmar and the Kufans finally agreed on Al-Mughƒ´rah ibn Shu ªbah. The city was built in a circular plan according to the Partho-Sasanian architecture. Uthman's eraGovernorship of Al-Walid= Following Umar's death (644), his successor Uthman replaced Mughirah with Al-Walid ibn Uqba in 645. This happened while the Arabs were continuing their conquest of western Persia under Uthman ibn Abi al-As from Tawwaj, but late in the 640s, these forces suffered setbacks. =Setbacks and governorship of Abu Musa= Uthman in 650 reorganised the Iranian frontier; both Basra and Kufa received new governors (Sa'id ibn al-'As in Kufa's case), and the east came under Basra's command while north of that remained under Kufa's. The few but noticeable trouble makers in Kufa sought in 654 and had Sa'id deposed and instead showed satisfaction with the return of Abu Musa, which Uthman approved seeking to please all. Kufa remained a source of instigations albeit from a minority. In 656 when the Egyptian instigators, in co-operation with those in Kufa, marched onto the Caliph Uthman in Medina, Abu Musa counselled the instigators to no avail. Ali's era Upon Uthman's assassination by rebels, governor Abu Musa attempted to restore a non-violent atmosphere in Kufa. The Muslims in Medina and elsewhere supported the right of Ali ibn Abu Talib to the caliphate. In order to manage the Military frontiers more efficiently, Ali shifted the capital from Medina to Kufa. The people of Syria and their governor, Muawiyah, who seized the Caliphate for himself and his family by using the confusion caused by the assassination of Caliph Uthman and being disturbed by the brutal assassination of the Caliph Uthman, demanded retribution. As Muawiyah mounted his campaign to hold Ali responsible for the murder of Uthman, factions developed. In an already emotionally charged atmosphere, Muawiyah's refusal to give allegiance to Ali as the Caliph without Ali avenging Uthman first eventually, led to war. While praying in the Great Mosque of Kufa, Ali was attacked by the Khawarij Abd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam. He was wounded by ibn Muljam's poison-coated sword while prostrating in the Fajr prayer.caliph Ali ibn Abu talib gives many speech in kufa during caliphate period and explain everything in speech in Majid kufa Umayyad eraGovernorship of Ziyad= Muawiyah I appointed Ziyad ibn Abihi Al the Governor of Kufa, after Hasan's migration to Medina, which was a peace treaty which dictated he abdicate his right to caliphate to avoid an open war among Muslims. Some of Hasan's followers, like Hujr ibn Adi, were unhappy with the peace treaty, and did not change their ways according to the edicts of the new Governor. This became increasingly noticeable, since it created a rebellion against the ruler. However, Ziyad ibn Abihi was an equally keen strategist and politician, and was able to put down all challenges posed by the rebels against his rule. Revolts Throughout the Umayyad era, as was the case since the inception of the city by Umar ibn Khattab, there were those among Kufa's inhabitants who were rebellious to their rulers. Yazid I was declared as the Second Umayyad Caliph which led to a rebellion among Kufans and they turned to Muhammad's grandson Husayn for help and leadership. Yazid appointed Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad as the new Governor to put down the rebellion, and kill Husayn if he did not acknowledge his Caliphate, culminating in the Battle of Karbala. There was a period of relative calm during the short reign of Al- Mukhtar's rulership, and the Umayyad-era Governorship of Al-Hajjaj. Abbasid era Folio from the Tarikhnama of Bal'ami depicting al-Saffah as he receives pledges of allegiance in Kufa In 749, the Abbasids under al-Hasan ibn Qahtaba took Kufa and made it their capital. In 762, they moved their seat to Baghdad. Under the Umayyad and early Abbasid decades, Kufa's importance gradually shifted from caliphal politics to Islamic theory and practice. =Kufa in Islamic theology and scholarship= Wael Hallaq notes that by contrast with Medina and to a lesser extent Syria, in Iraq there was no unbroken Muslim or Ishmaelite population dating back to the prophet Muhammad's time. Therefore, Maliki (and Azwa'i) appeals to the practice amal () of the community could not apply. Instead the people of Iraq relied upon those Companions of the Muhammad who settled there, and upon such factions from the Hijaz whom they respected most. A primary founder of a Sunni school of thought, Abu Hanifa, was a Kufan who had supported the Zaydi Revolt in the 730s; and his jurisprudence was systematised and defended against non-Iraqi rivals (starting with Malikism) by other Kufans, such as al-Shaybani. Shirazi's \\"Tabaqat\\", which Hallaq labels \\"an important early biographical work dedicated to jurists\\", covered 84 \\"towering figures\\" of Islamic jurisprudence; to which Kufa provided 20. It was therefore a center surpassed only by Medina (22), although Basra came close (17). Kufans could claim that the more prominent of Muhammad's Companions had called that city home: not only Ibn Abu Waqqas, Abu Musa, and Ali; but also Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud, Salman the Persian, Ammar ibn Yasir, and Huzayfa ibn Yaman. Among its jurists prior to Abu Hanifa, Hallaq singles out Sa'id ibn Jubayr, Ibrahim al-Nakha‚Äòi, and Hammad ibn Abi Sulayman; and considers Amir al-Sha‚Äòbi a pioneer in the science of judicial precedent. Additionally, Imam Muhammad al-Baqir and his son Jafar al-Sadiq made decisions from Medina that contributed to the law of Kufa; and to this day Shi‚Äòite law follows their example. Imam Abu Hanifa too learnt from al-Baqir and especially al-Sadiq. As a result, while Hanafi school is doctrinally Sunni, in practical terms Hanafi law is closer to Imami law than either is to the other schools of jurisprudence i.e. of Malik, Shafi‚Äòi, and Ibn Hanbal. Kufa was also among the first centers of Qur'anic interpretation, which Kufans credited to the exegete Mujahid (until he escaped to Mecca in 702). It further recorded general traditions as Hadith; in the 9th century, Yahya ibn ‚ÄòAbd al-Hamid al-Himmani compiled many of these into a Musnad. Given Kufa's opposition to Damascus, Kufan traditionists had their own take on Umayyad history. The historian Abu Mikhnaf al-Azdi (d. 774) compiled their accounts into a rival history, which became popular under Abbasid rule. This history does not survive but later historians like Tabari quoted from it extensively. Kufa is also where the kufic script was developed, the earliest script of the Arabic language. As the scholar al-Qalqashandi maintained, \\"The Arabic script [khatt] is the one which is now known as Kufic. From it evolved all the present hands.\\" The angular script which later came to be known as Kufic had its origin about a century earlier than the founding of the town of Kufa, according to Moritz in the Encyclopaedia of Islam. The kufic script was derived from one of the four pre- Islamic Arabic scripts, the one called al-Hiri (used in Hirah). (The other three were al-Anbari (from Anbar), al-Makki (from Mecca) and al-Madani (from Medina)). Ibn al-Nadim (died ca. 999) the author of the famous Kitab al- Fihrist, an index of Arabic books, dedicates the a section of the first chapter to calligraphy. He was the first to use the word 'kufic' to characterize this script, which reached a state of decorative perfection in the 8th century, when surahs were used to decorate ceramics, for representations of nature were strictly forbidden under the Islamic regime. Al-Fihrist contains the biographies of many of the grammarian philologists from the school of Kufa and from its rival school of Basra. A third chapter treats of the grammarians from both schools. Post-Abbasid history Kufa began to come under constant attack in the 11th century and eventually shrunk and lost its importance. Over the last century, the population of Kufa began to grow again. It continues to be an important pilgrimage site for Shi'ite Muslims. Religious significance The town has produced several Shi'ite Muslim scholars.The United States Army in Operation Iraqi Freedom, p 330, Donald P. Wright, Timothy R.

He represented the 22nd District of Florida until he was defeated by Ron Klein in the 2006 midterm election. Early life, education, and legal career Shaw was born in Miami, Florida. He graduated in 1957 from Miami Edison Senior High School. He received a bachelor's degree in business in 1961 from Stetson University in Florida, where he joined Sigma Nu fraternity, a master's degree in accounting in 1963 from the University of Alabama, and a law degree in 1966 from Stetson University School of Law. Shaw married the former Emilie Costar on August 22, 1960. After graduating, Shaw practiced law and worked as a certified public accountant. In 1968, he became assistant city attorney in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He was chief city prosecutor from 1968 to 1969 and an associate municipal judge from 1969 to 1971. Fort Lauderdale politics Shaw was the city commissioner from 1971 to 1973. and vice mayor 1973 to 1975. He then served as mayor of Fort Lauderdale from 1975 to 1981. During his tenure as mayor, Shaw served on the Advisory Board and Executive Committee of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, former President of the National Conference of Republican Mayors, and was named Special U.S. Ambassador to Papua New Guinea by President Gerald Ford.Fort Lauderdale News/Sun-Sentinel Metro; Sunday, Dec. 21, 1980; 2B U.S. House of Representatives=Elections ;1980 The 1980 election cycle provided National Republicans with the opportunity to gain Congressional seats. As Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter battled for the White House, the National Republican Campaign Committee was actively seeking a Republican candidate in South Florida to challenge freshman Democratic congressman Edward J. Stack. The district, one of Florida's first Republican areas, had been held by Republican J. Herbert Burke for 12 years before Stack ousted him in 1978. Having been turned down by two potential candidates, including state Senator Van B. Poole, National Congressional Republicans set their eyes on popular Fort Lauderdale mayor, Clay Shaw. After multiple attempts to convince Shaw to run for Congress, Shaw agreed. With the support of his wife, Emilie, and four young children, he undertook the task of defeating an incumbent. However, Shaw's candidacy received a significant boost when Stack was upset in the Democratic primary by a young Fort Lauderdale lawyer, Allen Becker. Shaw and Becker faced off in a spirited November general election with Shaw winning 55 percent of the vote. Congressman-elect Shaw was on his way to Washington to represent Broward County's 15th Congressional district. Also in 1980, Ronald Reagan became the 40th President of the United States, and Republicans gained control of the United States Senate. ;1982 Redistricting numbered Shaw's district as the 15th District. Shaw faced a rematch against his predecessor, Ed Stack. However, Shaw turned back this challenge fairly easily, winning 57 percent of the vote. ;1984 Shaw won re- election with 66% against Democratic nominee Bill Humphrey. ;1986 Shaw won re- election without opposition. ;1988 Shaw won re-election with 66% against Democratic nominee Mike Kuhle. ;1990 Shaw was re-elected without opposition. ;1992 In November 1992, Shaw faced his toughest congressional opponent to date. Following the 1990 U.S. Census, the Democratic-controlled Florida Legislature reapportioned the state's congressional districts. Shaw's district was renumbered as the 22nd District and significantly altered. For his first five terms, he had represented a relatively compact district in Broward County. However, it was reconfigured into a district that stretched for 90 miles along the coast, from Juno Beach to the north to Lincoln Road on Miami Beach to the south. His Democratic opponent was State Senate President Gwen Margolis, who had drawn her home in Dade County into the district. The Shaw‚ÄìMargolis race was highly competitive. Both campaigns were full of energy and raised thousands of dollars in campaign contributions. The campaigns highlighted the other candidates' records. She claimed that Shaw voted to \\"decriminalize drugs\\" while in Washington. Shaw called the claim \\"an absolute falsehood\\". She fought back concerns about her involvement with the failed Miami Beach Savings & Loan. In March 1992, the Resolute Trust Corporation filed suit against Margolis and other bank directors claiming they approved speculative loans and were responsible for $4.5 million in losses. In the end, however, Shaw cruised to victory in November, claiming 58% of the general election vote. ;1994 Shaw won re-election with 63% of the vote against Democratic nominee Hermine Weiner. Shaw was a supporter of the Republican Contract with America that helped sweep the Republican Party to control of the United States Congress for the first time in forty years. ;1996 Shaw won re- election with 62% of the vote against Democratic nominee Ken Cooper. ;1998 Shaw was re-elected unopposed. ;2000 Speaker Dennis Hastert for the 108th Congress Seeking his 10th term in Congress, Shaw faced a challenge in state Representative Elaine Bloom. Bloom declared her candidacy in June 1999. Aided by the Democratic presidential ticket of Al Gore and Joe Lieberman, Bloom was making the race competitive. In early October it was reported that Bloom served on the board of a Florida pharmaceutical company that was accused of price fixing. Bloom denied the accusations, yet press reports, including a piece on Nightline, highlighted the price fixing scandal. Bloom remained on defense for the remainder of the campaign. Ultimately, Shaw won by 599 votes out of more than 220,000 votes cast. It was only the second difficult re- election contest for Shaw. The district, once a Republican-leaning swing district, swung Democratic in the early 1990s along with much of South Florida. In 2000, Al Gore defeated George W. Bush in the district by 52% to 48%. ;2002 Following Shaw's extremely close race in 2000, the state legislature, now controlled by Republicans, cut out the heavily Democratic spur of Miami-Dade County that had been added in the 1990s round of redistricting, pushing it further into Palm Beach County. Although the district was friendlier for Shaw than its predecessor, it was only slightly less Democratic than its predecessor (even though Republicans had a small plurality of registered voters). Shaw was re-elected with 61% of the vote against Democrat Carol Roberts, a former Palm Beach County Commissioner. ;2004 Shaw won re-election with 63% of the vote against a last-minute replacement Democratic candidate, Robin Rorapaugh.

Clay Shaw Jr. bridge. ;Missing Children's Act Swept into office as part of the Reagan Revolution, Shaw quickly found himself at the center of a national tragedy following the death of 7-year-old constituent Adam Walsh. As a result of this tragedy, Shaw introduced the Missing Children's Act of 1982. The legislation allowed parents access to a central computer file designed to trace missing children. President Reagan signed the legislation on October 12, 1982. Shaw was honored for his efforts and continued support for missing and exploited children in 2004, with other members of Congress, by the Center for Missing and Exploited Children and its founder John Walsh. ;Posse Comitatus As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, Shaw aggressively supported legislation to fight the War on Drugs. In fall 1986, Shaw lamented that illegal drugs were \\"the biggest threat we have ever had to our national security.\\" To combat the rise of illegal drug trafficking and its impact on Americans, in May 1988 the House of Representatives voted 385 to 23 authorizing 45 days for President Reagan to mobilize U.S. armed forces in the fight against illegal drug trafficking. The legislation required the U.S. military to halt illegal drug trafficking into the southern portions of the United States while requiring the Pentagon to begin aerial radar coverage of the U.S. southern border. The legislation amended the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act which prohibited the military from enforcing civilian laws. Calling the overwhelming bipartisan vote the end of a defeatist \\"Vietnam type mentality toward the war on drugs\\", Shaw solidified his standing as a leader in the War on Drugs. ;Welfare reform Shaw said in 1994, \\"The inscription at the base of the Statue of Liberty was written before welfare. People come to this country to work. Now the question becomes, Are these handouts a magnet that is bringing people into this country? To some degree, they are.\\" As a result of the Republican takeover of the United States Congress following the 1994 mid-term elections, Shaw was awarded with his first chairmanship of his Congressional career. As a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee, Shaw was tapped to chair the Human Resources Subcommittee. This move was significant, for included in the Republican Contract with America was a commitment to reform of the nation's welfare system. Shaw began work on reforming welfare in 1995 by holding numerous committee hearings and public sessions to identify problems within the welfare system. Working with state governors such as Florida Governor Lawton Chiles, Michigan Governor John Engler, Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson and Delaware Governor Tom Carper, Shaw began crafting legislation that shifted the federal focus of social welfare to an emphasis on personal responsibility. After two presidential vetoes by President Bill Clinton, Welfare Reform was finally signed into law on August 22, 1996. Committee assignments ;House Ways and Means Committee Shaw was the second most senior Republican on the House Ways and Means committee at the time he left Congress, having assumed that position after Phil Crane lost in his bid for re-election. ;Trade subcommittee From 2005 to 2007, Shaw chaired the Ways and Means Trade subcommittee and was actively involved in the passage of the United States free trade agreement between a number of Central American nations and the Dominican Republic. As Chairman, Shaw and his fellow Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee voted the trade agreement out of committee on a straight party line vote. Shortly thereafter the House passed, by a vote of 217‚Äì215, the Dominican Republic Central American Free Trade Agreement (DR-CAFTA) to open U.S. exports up, duty-free, to the Central American nations of the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. President [George W. Bush] signed the United States-DR-CAFTA Free Trade Agreement on August 3, 2005, with Shaw and other members of Congress present. In addition, Shaw was a strong supporter of U.S. export opportunities to the impoverished nation of Haiti.http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-108hr1031ih/pdf/BILLS-108hr1031ih.pdf ;Social Security Subcommittee From 1999 to 2005, he was a Chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee. As Chairman of the Social Security committee, Shaw introduced legislation to repeal the Social Security Earnings Penalty. In March 2000, the House of Representatives, by a vote of 422‚Äì0 passed the Social Security Earnings Penalty repeal. Following Senate approval, President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law. The new law allows seniors ages 65 to 69 to continue working without the fear of losing their Social Security benefits. ;Human Resources Subcommittee From 1995 to 1998, Shaw chaired the Human Resources subcommittee. Following the 1994 Republican takeover of Congress, Shaw was named as chair of this important House committee. Having introduced legislation previously to reform welfare, he found himself in a key post to enact much-needed reform. As a result of his efforts, the welfare system was drastically changed and replaced with an emphasis on personal responsibility. Welfare reform was the hallmark of Shaw's congressional career. ;Florida Congressional Delegation Chairman Shaw was also the chairman of the Florida delegation from 1996 until leaving office in 2007. In this capacity, Shaw coordinated activities by the delegation including bipartisan delegation meetings. In this capacity, he facilitated discussion amongst Florida colleagues on particular issues or topics and invited special guests to address the delegation including Governor Jeb Bush, Federal Emergency Management Agency Director David Paulison, and federal and state officials. ;House 2015 caucus In 2003, following lung cancer surgery, Shaw, along with Minnesota Congressman Colin Peterson, founded the House 2015 Caucus. The purpose of the 2015 Caucus was to find a cure for cancer or treat it as a manageable disease by 2015. Members of the caucus expressed their desire to eliminate cancer disease and suffering by 2015. Shaw was also a member of the Congressional Arts Caucus, Congressional Fire Services Caucus, Congressional Narcotics Abuse and Control Caucus, Congressional Social Security Caucus, Congressional Travel and Tourism Caucus, Friends of Ireland, Law Enforcement Caucus and Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Caucus. He was also the co- chair of the Congressional Boating Caucus, Congressional Coastal Caucus and International Conservation Caucus. Post-congressional career In 2007, following his departure from Congress, Shaw provided his entire Congressional collection to his alma mater, Stetson University. The Shaw collection is housed at the university's duPont-Ball library in DeLand, Florida. In 2008, Clay Shaw was named a Great Floridian by the Florida Department of State, an honor extended to individuals who made major contributions to the progress and welfare of the state of Florida.Florida Legislature website: The 2007 Florida Statutes-Title XVIII Shaw's honor was advocated by state House Representative Adam Hasner (R-Delray Beach). Other Great Floridians include Governors LeRoy Collins, Lawton Chiles and Bob Martinez; NASCAR founder Bill France, environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas, inventor John Gorrie and Senator Claude Pepper. Clay Shaw remained active in the Ft. Lauderdale community, including chairing the recent celebration of Ft. Lauderdale's founding.  Personal life  Shaw and his wife Emilie had four children and 15 grandchildren. Shaw died September 10, 2013, after a battle with lung cancer. He was 74. He is buried in Cuba, Alabama.

The PSTN consists of telephone lines, fiber optic cables, microwave transmission links, cellular networks, communications satellites, and undersea telephone cables, all interconnected by switching centers, thus allowing most telephones to communicate with each other. Originally a network of fixed-line analog telephone systems, the PSTN is now almost entirely digital in its core network and includes mobile and other networks, as well as fixed telephones. The technical operation of the PSTN adheres to the standards created by the ITU-T. These standards allow different networks in different countries to interconnect seamlessly. The E.163 and E.164 standards provide a single global address space for telephone numbers. The combination of the interconnected networks and the single numbering plan allow telephones around the world to dial each other.  History  Commercialization of the telephone began in 1876, with instruments operated in pairs for private use between two locations. Users who wanted to communicate with persons at multiple locations had as many telephones as necessary for the purpose. Alerting another user of the desire to establish a telephone call was accomplished by whistling loudly into the transmitter until the other party heard the alert. Bells were soon added to stations for signaling, so an attendant no longer needed to wait for the whistle. Later telephones took advantage of the exchange principle already employed in telegraph networks. Each telephone was wired to a telephone exchange established for a town or area. For communications outside this exchange area, trunks were installed between exchanges. Networks were designed in a hierarchical manner until they spanned cities, countries, continents and oceans. Automation introduced pulse dialing between the telephone and the exchange, so that each subscriber could directly dial another subscriber connected to the same exchange, but long-distance calling across multiple exchanges required manual switching by operators. Later, more sophisticated address signaling, including multi-frequency signaling methods, enabled direct-dialed long-distance calls by subscribers, culminating in the Signalling System 7 (SS7) network that controlled calls between most exchanges by the end of the 20th century. The growth of the PSTN meant that teletraffic engineering techniques needed to be deployed to deliver quality of service (QoS) guarantees for the users. The work of A. K. Erlang established the mathematical foundations of methods required to determine the capacity requirements and configuration of equipment and the number of personnel required to deliver a specific level of service. In the 1970s, the telecommunications industry began implementing packet-switched network data services using the X.25 protocol transported over much of the end-to-end equipment as was already in use in the PSTN. In the 1980s, the industry began planning for digital services assuming they would follow much the same pattern as voice services, and conceived end-to-end circuit-switched services, known as the Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN). The B-ISDN vision was overtaken by the disruptive technology of the Internet. At the turn of the 21st century, the oldest parts of the telephone network still use analog technology for the last mile loop to the end user. However, digital technologies such as DSL, ISDN, FTTx, and cable modems have become more common in this portion of the network. Several large private telephone networks are not linked to the PSTN, usually for military purposes. There are also private networks run by large companies which are linked to the PSTN only through limited gateways, such as a large private branch exchange (PBX).  Operators  The task of building the networks and selling services to customers fell to the network operators. The first company to be incorporated to provide PSTN services was the Bell Telephone Company in the United States. In some countries, however, the job of providing telephone networks fell to government as the investment required was very large and the provision of telephone service was increasingly becoming an essential public utility. For example, the General Post Office in the United Kingdom brought together a number of private companies to form a single nationalized company. In more recent decades, these state monopolies were broken up or sold off through privatization.  Regulation  In most countries, the central has a regulator dedicated to monitoring the provision of PSTN services in that country. Their tasks may be for example to ensure that end customers are not over-charged for services where monopolies may exist. These regulatory agencies may also regulate the prices charged between the operators to carry each other's traffic.  Technology = Network topology  The PSTN network architecture had to evolve over the years to support increasing numbers of subscribers, calls, connections to other countries, direct dialing and so on. The model developed by the United States and Canada was adopted by other nations, with adaptations for local markets. The original concept was that the telephone exchanges are arranged into hierarchies, so that if a call cannot be handled in a local cluster, it is passed to one higher up for onward routing. This reduced the number of connecting trunks required between operators over long distances and also kept local traffic separate. However, in modern networks the cost of transmission and equipment is lower and, although hierarchies still exist, they are much flatter, with perhaps only two layers.  Digital channels  Most automated telephone exchanges use digital switching rather than mechanical or analog switching. The trunks connecting the exchanges are also digital, called circuits or channels. However analog two-wire circuits are still used to connect the last mile from the exchange to the telephone in the home (also called the local loop). To carry a typical phone call from a calling party to a called party, the analog audio signal is digitized at an 8 kHz sample rate with 8-bit resolution using a special type of nonlinear pulse code modulation known as G.711. The call is then transmitted from one end to another via telephone exchanges. The call is switched using a call set up protocol (usually ISUP) between the telephone exchanges under an overall routing strategy. The call is carried over the PSTN using a 64 kbit/s channel, originally designed by Bell Labs. The name given to this channel is Digital Signal 0 (DS0). The DS0 circuit is the basic granularity of circuit switching in a telephone exchange. A DS0 is also known as a timeslot because DS0s are aggregated in time-division multiplexing (TDM) equipment to form higher capacity communication links. A Digital Signal 1 (DS1) circuit carries 24 DS0s on a North American or Japanese T-carrier (T1) line, or 32 DS0s (30 for calls plus two for framing and signaling) on an E-carrier (E1) line used in most other countries. In modern networks, the multiplexing function is moved as close to the end user as possible, usually into cabinets at the roadside in residential areas, or into large business premises. These aggregated circuits are conveyed from the initial multiplexer to the exchange over a set of equipment collectively known as the access network. The access network and inter-exchange transport use synchronous optical transmission, for example, SONET and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) technologies, although some parts still use the older PDH technology. Within the access network, there are a number of reference points defined. Most of these are of interest mainly to ISDN but one ‚Äì the V reference point ‚Äì is of more general interest. This is the reference point between a primary multiplexer and an exchange. The protocols at this reference point were standardized in ETSI areas as the V5 interface.  Impact on IP standards  Voice quality over PSTN networks was used as the benchmark for the development of the Telecommunications Industry Association's TIA-TSB-116 standard on voice-quality recommendations for IP telephony, to determine acceptable levels of audio delay and echo.

The range runs east- west, separating the San Fernando Valley and Simi Valley on its south from the Santa Clara River Valley to the north and the Santa Clarita Valley to the northeast. The Oxnard Plain is to the west of the Santa Susana Mountains. Description=Geography The Newhall Pass separates the Santa Susana Mountains from the San Gabriel Mountains to the east. Newhall Pass is the major north-south connection between the San Fernando Valley and the Santa Clarita Valley, and Interstate 5 and a railroad line share Newhall Pass. The Santa Susana Pass (containing SR 118) connects Simi Valley and the San Fernando Valley, and separates the Santa Susana Mountains from the Simi Hills to the south. Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park is located in the Simi Hills, just south of the Santa Susana Pass, at the northwestern edge of the San Fernando Valley. The Santa Susana Mountains are not as steep or high as the San Gabriel Mountains. The western half of the range lies in Ventura County, and the eastern half lies in Los Angeles County. The southeastern slopes of the Santa Susana Mountains are part of the City of Los Angeles, and housing subdivisions, including Porter Ranch, have been built on the lower slopes of the range. The city of Simi Valley lies to the southwest. North of the range is the fast-growing city of Santa Clarita, and several large subdivisions in unincorporated Los Angeles County, including Lyons Ranch and Newhall Ranch, have been approved for development. The Sunshine Canyon Landfill is at the mountains' eastern end, and several canyons in the northwest corner of the range have been proposed for more landfills. The Santa Susana Mountains are paralleled by State Route 118 to the south and State Route 126 to the north. Climate The mountains have a mild climate, with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters (Mediterranean climate type). Snow falls in winter in some higher areas, such as Oat Mountain, but melts quickly. Annual precipitation totals vary between 18 and 25 inches, depending on exposure to the rain-bearing winds. Most of the rain falls between November and March. Because of the summer drought, wildfires sometimes occur in summer and fall before the rains start, especially during hot, dry \\"Santa Ana\\" wind events (mostly between late September to mid November). Peaks The highest peaks in the range are Oat Mountain (1,142 m; 3,747 feet), Mission Point (845 m; 2,771 feet), Rocky Peak (827 m; 2,714 feet), and Sand Rock Peak (765 m; 2,511 feet). The summit of Rocky Peak lies directly atop the line separating Ventura and Los Angeles counties and is indicated by a battered marker imbedded into the sandstone boulder summit. History The Santa Susana Mountains are depicted in the bottom right quarter of the seal of nearby California State University, Northridge. The first discovery of oil in California was in Pico Canyon, on the north side of the mountains, The California Star Oil Works, later Chevron, succeeded with Pico Well No. 4. It became famous not only as the first well in California, but also as the longest-producing well in the world, having been capped in September, 1990 after 114 years. Well No. 4 has the distinction of being the first site in Los Angeles County to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places, in 1966. The surrounding town, Mentryville, is maintained as the oil \\"ghost town\\" Mentryville Historical Park, within Pico Canyon Park. Many active oil and gas fields remain in the area, with some of the larger operators including Vintage Production, Freeport McMoRan, and the Southern California Gas Company. The largest of SoCalGas's four underground storage natural gas facilities is within the Aliso Canyon Oil Field north of Porter Ranch. The mountains are within the acquisition area for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which operates several parks, including Santa Clarita Woodlands Park, Rocky Peak Park, Joughin Open Space Preserve, Happy Camp Canyon Regional Park, and other Santa Susana parks in the Santa Susana Mountains through the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority. The City of Los Angeles maintains O'Melveny Park at the eastern end of the mountains. Note: the Santa Susana Field Laboratory, once operated by and still owned by Rocketdyne until toxics are cleaned up, is actually in the Simi Hills, which are adjacent to the south of the Santa Susana Mountains. Plants and animals=Flora Santa Susana Tarweed, Hemizonia minthornii, vulnerable speciesThe south-facing slopes are mostly covered in Chaparral shrubland, grasslands, and oak savanna. The north- facing slopes are home to magnificent oak woodlands and conifer (fir) woodlands, some of which have been protected in the Santa Clarita Woodlands Park and other large open space preserves. The mountains are part of the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. The oaks, (Quercus spp.), include the evergreen coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia), the deciduous valley oak (Quercus lobata), and the coastal scrub oak (Quercus dumosa) all can be found in the area. Spring wildflowers include the redbush monkey flower, Mariposa lily, and canyon sunflower. Poison oak is also an important member of the native plant habitat community. Various ferns are found in moister and tree-shaded areas. Fauna Many bird species thrive in the Santa Susana Mountains. Perhaps the most common raptors observed soaring over the brushy, boulder-strewn landscape are turkey vultures, red-tailed hawks, and American kestrels. In oak woodlands it is not uncommon to see red-shouldered hawks flying from limb to limb. Through the cover of dense, trailside chaparral you might glimpse the California towhee or the colorful spotted towhee, birds who often make their presence known by rustling up leaf litter on the ground. California quail, greater roadrunner, and common raven are also residents of the range. The eerie and enchanting call of the common poorwill can often be heard after dark while quick eyes might observe the silent flight of great horned owls and phantom-like barn owls. A handful of fascinating amphibians live in the area. Streams and creeks support populations of Pacific tree frog, the small amphibian whose signature chorus adds an aura of mystery and inexplicable beauty to the surrounding land. Western toads often make their appearance at nightfall, emerging from burrows in search of water and insects, while California slender salamanders are often found under the cool leaf litter and canopy of oak woodlands. Many reptiles thrive in the Santa Susana range. Lizards that are likely to be observed on any given day include the common western fence lizard and the equally abundant side-blotched lizard. Somewhat less frequently observed but still present are the southern alligator lizard, western skink, whiptail, and the seemingly rare coast horned lizard. Southern Pacific rattlesnakes and gopher snakes are perhaps the most commonly observed snakes, but a lucky hiker might also encounter other species including the striped racer, California kingsnake, and ring-necked snake. Mammals that may be regularly observed in the mountains include smaller animals such as the California ground squirrel and brush rabbit. Small mammals that are less often seen include the dusky-footed woodrat and the agile kangaroo rat. As for larger mammals, the well-trained eye might spot California mule deer or a coyote. Larger mammals that are considerably more secretive and therefore less often encountered include the gray fox, bobcat, ring-tailed cat, American badger, and the mountain lion. A population of American black bears occupy various niches in the backcountry; showing up in communities below the mountains every few years. The mountains are part of the Southern California coastal wildlife corridor the connects Los Padres National Forest with the Santa Monica Mountains.McGrath, Rachel (June 21, 2014) \\"Park district joins effort to preserve wildlife corridor, open space between Simi Valley, Moorpark\\" Ventura County Star Rim of the Valley Trail The Rim of the Valley Trail is a plan in progress for connecting the parkland and recreational areas of the San Fernando, Simi, and La Crescenta Valleys via the Santa Susana Mountains.

Found at great depths from the Arctic to Antarctic, members of this subfamily are amongst the most abundant of the deep-sea fish. The macrourins form a large and diverse family with 28 extant genera recognized (well over half of the total species are contained in just three genera, Coelorinchus, Coryphaenoides, and Nezumia). They range in length from about in Hymenogadus gracilis to in Albatrossia pectoralis. An important commercial fishery exists for the larger species, such as the giant grenadier and Coryphaenoides rupestris. The subfamily as a whole may represent up to 15% of the deep-sea fish population. Typified by large heads with large mouths and eyes, grenadiers have slender bodies that taper greatly to very thin caudal peduncles or tails (excluding one species with no tail fin): this rat-like tail explains the common name 'rattail' and both the subfamily name and family name are derived from the Greek makros meaning \\"great\\" and oura meaning \\"tail\\". The first dorsal fin is small, high, and pointed (and may be spinous); the second dorsal fin runs along the rest of the back and merges with the tail and extensive anal fin. The scales are small. As with many deep-living fish, the lateral line system in grenadiers is well-developed; it is further aided by numerous chemoreceptors located on the head and lips and chemosensory barbels underneath the chin. Benthic species have gas bladders with unique muscles attached to them. The animals are thought to use these muscles to \\"strum\\" their gas bladders and produce sound, possibly playing a role in courtship and mate location. Light-producing organs, photophores, are present in some species; they are located in the middle of the abdomen, just before the anus and underneath the skin. Grenadiers have been recorded from depths of about , and are among the most common benthic fish of the deep (however, two genera are known to prefer the midwater). They may be solitary or may form large schools, as with the roundnose grenadiers. The benthic species are attracted to structural oases, such as hydrothermal vents, cold seeps, and shipwrecks. They are thought to be generalists, feeding on smaller fish, pelagic crustaceans such as shrimp, amphipods, cumaceans, and less often cephalopods and lanternfish. As well as being important apex predators in the benthic habitat, some species are also notable as scavengers. As few rattail larvae have been recovered, little is known of their life histories. They are known to produce a large number (over 100,000) of tiny ( in diameter) eggs made buoyant by lipid droplets. The eggs are presumed to float up to the thermocline (the interface between warmer surface waters and cold, deeper waters) where they develop. The juveniles remain in shallower waters, gradually migrating to greater depths with age. Spawning may or may not be tied to the seasons, depending on the species. At least one species, Coryphaenoides armatus, is thought to be semelparous; that is, the adults die after spawning. Nonsemelparous species may live to 56 years or more. The macrourins, in general, are thought to have low resilience; commercially exploited species may be overfished and this could soon lead to a collapse of their fisheries. Genera Currently 28 extant genera in this subfamily are recognized:Iwamoto, T., Nakayama, N., Shao, K.-T. & Ho, H.-C. (2015): Synopsis of the Grenadier Fishes (Gadiformes; Teleostei) of Taiwan.

Originally a newspaper panel, the Believe It or Not feature proved popular and was later adapted into a wide variety of formats, including radio, television, comic books, a chain of museums and a book series. The Ripley collection includes 20,000 photographs, 30,000 artifacts and more than 100,000 cartoon panels. With 80-plus attractions, the Orlando, Florida-based Ripley Entertainment, Inc., a division of the Jim Pattison Group, is a global company with an annual attendance of more than 12 million guests. Ripley Entertainment's publishing and broadcast divisions oversee numerous projects, including the syndicated TV series, the newspaper cartoon panel, books, posters and games. Syndicated feature panel Ripley first called his cartoon feature, originally involving sports feats, Champs and Chumps, and it premiered on December 19, 1918 in The New York Globe. Ripley began adding items unrelated to sports, and in October 1919, he changed the title to Believe It or Not. When the Globe folded in 1923, Ripley moved to the New York Evening Post. In 1924, the panel began being syndicated by Associated Newspapers,Thompson, Neal. A Curious Man: The Strange & Brilliant Life of Robert \\"Believe It Or Not!\\" Ripley (Crown/Archetype, 2014), p. 115. (formed as part of a cooperative that had included the Globe). That same year, Ripley hired Norbert Pearlroth as his researcher, and Pearlroth spent the next 52 years of his life in the New York Public Library, working ten hours a day and six days a week in order to find unusual facts for Ripley. Other writers and researchers included Lester Byck. In 1930, Ripley moved to the New York American and was picked up by the King Features Syndicate, being quickly syndicated on an international basis.Thompson, A Curious Man, pp. 163-165. Ripley died in 1949; those working on the syndicated newspaper panel after his death included Paul Frehm (1938‚Äì1978; he became the full-time artist in 1949), and his brother Walter Frehm (1948‚Äì1989); Walter worked part-time with his brother Paul and became a full-time Ripley artist from 1978 to 1989. Others who assisted included Clem Gretter (1941‚Äì1949), Bob Clarke (1943‚Äì1944), Joe Campbell (1946‚Äì1956), Art Sloggatt (1971‚Äì1975), Carl Dorese, and Stan Randall. Paul Frehm won the National Cartoonists Society's Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1976 for his work on the series. Clarke later created parodies of Believe It or Not! for Mad, as did Wally Wood and Ernie Kovacs, who also did a recurring satire called \\"Strangely Believe It!\\" on his TV programs. Other strips and books borrowed the Ripley design and format, such as Ralph Graczak's Our Own Oddities, John Hix's Strange as It Seems, and Gordon Johnston's It Happened in Canada. The current artist is John Graziano and current researcher is Sabrina Sieck. At the peak of its popularity, the syndicated feature was read daily by about 80 million readers, and during the first three weeks of May 1932 alone, Ripley received over two million pieces of fan mail. Dozens of paperback editions reprinting the newspaper panels have been published over the decades. Recent Ripley's Believe It or Not! books containing new material have supplemented illustrations with photographs. Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz's first publication of artwork was published by Ripley. It was a cartoon claiming his dog was \\"a hunting dog who eats pins, tacks, screws, nails and razor blades.\\" Schulz's dog Spike later became the model for Peanuts' Snoopy.

In 2004 Ripley Entertainment founded Ripley Publishing Ltd, based in the United Kingdom, to publish new Believe It or Not titles. The company produces the New York Times bestselling Ripley's Believe It or Not! Annuals, the children's fiction series Ripley's RBI, an educational series called the Ripley's Twists, the Ripley's Believe It or Not! Special Edition in conjunction with Scholastic USA and a number of other titles. At the height of his popularity Robert Ripley received thousands of letters a day from the public, and Ripley Entertainment continues to encourage submissions from readers who have strange stories and photographs that could be featured in Ripley's Believe It or Not! books and media. The people whose items are featured in such books as Strikingly True, have what Edward Meyer, Vice President of Exhibits and Archives at Ripley Entertainment Inc. describes as an obsession. \\"Whatever it is they're after, it is so important to them that all the rest of the world can go on without them. They want to make something that makes them immortal, makes them a little different than you and me.\\" Despite the wide range of true and unbelievable art, sculpture, photographs, interactive devices, animal oddities, and recycled objects contained within the Ripley's collection, rarely considered are alien or witchcraft-type stories, which are, according to Meyers, difficult to prove. To be included in Ripley's Believe It or Not books, museums, or television shows, items must undergo scrutiny from Ripley's staff and be 100% authenticated. Radio On April 14, 1930, Ripley brought \\"Believe It or Not\\" to radio, the first of several series heard on NBC, CBS and the Mutual Broadcasting System. As noted by the website Ripley On Radio, Ripley's broadcasts varied in length from 15 minutes to 30 minutes and aired in numerous different formats. When Ripley's 1930 debut on The Collier Hour brought a strong listener reaction, he was given a Monday night NBC series beginning April 14, 1930, followed by a 1931‚Äì32 series airing twice a week. After his strange stories were dramatized on NBC's Saturday Party, Ripley was the host of The Baker's Broadcast from 1935 to 1937. He was scheduled in several different 1937‚Äì38 NBC timeslots and then took to the road with popular remote broadcasts. See America First with Bob Ripley (1938‚Äì40) on CBS expanded geographically into See All the Americas, a 1942 program with Latin music. In 1944, he was heard five nights a week on Mutual in shows with an emphasis on World War II. Romance, Rhythm and Ripley aired on CBS in 1945, followed by Pages from Robert L. Ripley's Radio Scrapbook (1947‚Äì48). Robert Ripley is known for several radio firsts. He was the first to broadcast nationwide on a radio network from mid-ocean, and he also participated in the first broadcast from Buenos Aires to New York City. Assisted by a corps of translators, he was the first to broadcast to every nation in the world simultaneously. As the years went on, the show became less about oddities and featured guest-driven entertainment such as comedy routines. Sponsors over the course of the program included Pall Mall cigarettes and General Foods. The program ended its successful run in 1948 as Ripley prepared to convert the show format to television. Films, television, Internet, and computer game The newspaper feature has been adapted into more than a few films and TV shows. Film * Ripley hosted a series of two dozen Believe It or Not! theatrical short films between 1930 and 1932 for Warner Bros. Vitaphone. A 2-DVD release featuring 24 of these theatrical shorts is available in the United States beginning March 16, 2010 from Warner Home Video, through their Warner Archive manufacture-on- demand program. Directors on the shorts included Murray Roth (on the first five), Roy Mack and Alfred J. Goulding (latter half of second season). Leo Donnelly assisted later on commentary. The titles of the series were all numbered accordingly: **No. 1 / Vitaphone No. 1005, released May 4, 1930 **No. 2 / Vitaphone No. 1038, ¬© June 11, 1930 **No. 3 / Vitaphone No. 1053, August 31, 1930 (Film Daily review date) **No. 4 / Vitaphone No. 1067, released September 5, 1930 **No. 5 / Vitaphone No. 1093, released September 12, 1930 **No. 6 / Vitaphone No. 1109, ¬© November 5, 1930 **No. 7 / Vitaphone No. 1148, ¬© January 5, 1931 (features Medal of Honor recipient Daniel R.

Merrie Melodies cartoon titled Believe It or Else. Released on June 25, 1939, directed by Tex Avery and written by Dave Monahan, it featured a running gag in which Egghead (a prototype Elmer Fudd) appeared to declare, \\"I don't believe it!\\" On 5 November of the same year, another Avery documentary parody, Fresh Fish, was released. Written by Jack Miller, this cartoon's running gag was a two-headed fish that kept swimming onto the screen to ask, \\"Pardon me, but can you tell me where I can find Mister Ripley?\\" * 20th Century Fox produced another film short titled Acquitted by the Sea, released September 27, 1940, produced by Truman Talley and directed by Earl Allvine. This told an unusual story involving the Titanic. =Planned film= On October 4, 2004, Paramount Pictures announced plans for a film that would chronicle the life of Robert Ripley. The film was to be produced by James Jacks and his Alphaville Films company, associated with Paramount. Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski were hired to write the script. Jacks explained, \\"It's about the exploits of Robert Ripley, one of the most popular newspaper cartoonists in the '30s and '40s, who was well known for going around the world and looking for oddities and getting into adventures while doing so. We want to make a series of movies that, if not quite the truth, are the adventures that should have happened.\\" Jacks also said \\"We want to turn it into an Indiana Jones, a goofy version, as played by Johnny Depp. When they saw we had the writers from Larry Flynt, they thought that we wanted to make the kinky version, but we saw a chance to do a Spielberg-type movie with one of their characters.\\" On November 29, 2005, it was announced that Tim Burton would direct the film, with Jim Carrey starring as Robert Ripley. Filming was to begin in October 2006, for a 2007 release. Paramount hinted that the film, if successful, could be the start of a Ripley's film series. In addition to Jacks, Sean Daniel and Richard D. Zanuck were to serve as producers for the film. Zanuck spent six weeks in China to scout filming locations for the project. On June 12, 2006, Paramount delayed the start of production on the film for at least a year because its projected budget went over the allowed $150 million. Carrey had waived his entire upfront salary to help keep costs low, but the project remained over budget. Burton and Carrey also wanted to have Alexander and Karaszewski make changes to the film's script to focus more on Ripley's Believe It or Not column. Carrey was adamant on avoiding what happened with his previous project Fun with Dick and Jane, which required reshoots and additional editing as a result of beginning production without a script. Filming had been scheduled to begin in China in November 2006. Although Paramount could have delayed production to spring 2007, the film was delayed further to allow Burton to film Sweeney Todd. In December 2006, Burton and Carrey approved writer Steve Oedekerk to rewrite the script. Oedekerk had worked with Carrey on several previous projects. Production was to begin in China in winter 2008, for a 2009 release. In January 2007, Zanuck said he was no longer involved with the project, and that he was unaware that it was proceeding. Oedekerk's draft was completed in June 2007, and was approved that month by Paramount, Burton, and Carrey. At that time, Carrey hoped to have production finished by summer 2008. Later that month, it was reported that Paramount may be searching for a new director. In October 2008, Chris Columbus pitched an idea for the film that was approved by Carrey and Paramount. Columbus' idea involved scrapping the previous China-based storyline entirely. Negotiations were underway that month to hire Columbus as director, with plans to hire a writer afterwards. Paramount planned to release the film in 2011, and hoped that it would be the start of a Ripley's film series. In January 2011, Eric Roth was hired to write the script, with Carrey still attached to star. Ken Atchity and Chi-Li Wong joined the project as producers, alongside Jacks and Daniel. Television * The first Believe It or Not TV series, a live show hosted by Ripley, premiered on March 1, 1949. Shortly after the 13th episode, on May 27, 1949, Ripley died of a heart attack and several of his friends substituted as host, including future Ripley's Believe It or Not! president Doug Storer. Robert St. John served as host from the second season until the series ended on October 5, 1950. * A revival of the original series, titled Ripley's Believe It or Not!, aired from 1982 to 1986 on the ABC television network. Based on three pilots/specials conceived, produced and directed by Ron Lyon and Jack Haley, Jr, (1980‚Äì81) the series was a Haley/Lyon/Rastar production in association with Columbia Pictures. Featuring film star Jack Palance who hosted the popular series throughout its run, the series had three different co-hosts, who appeared from season to season, initially actress Catherine Shirriff followed by Palance's daughter, Holly Palance, later singer Marie Osmond. The 1980s series reran on the Sci-Fi Channel (UK) and Sci-Fi Channel (US) during the 1990s; it last aired on NBCUniversal's horror/suspense-themed cable channel Chiller. * A Canadian animated series, Ripley's Believe It or Not!, was produced for Fox Family in 1999 by Cookie Jar Entertainment, and followed the adventures of \\"Michael Ripley\\", Robert Ripley's nephew. The show was aimed at a younger audience, and would often feature Michael going around the world. * Another revival, once again titled Ripley's Believe It or Not!, aired from 2000 to 2003 on TBS. Hosted by actor Dean Cain, executive-produced by Dan Jbara and co-executive- produced by Dennis Lortz, the series took a slightly more sensationalistic approach to its subject matter and \\"premiered as the highest-rated original series on cable\\" at that time. The series was cancelled in October 2003 after four seasons. Like the previous syndicated live-action series, this latest edition moved to the Biography Channel for reruns, and continues to air today. * In 2006, the Philippines made a local adaptation of Ripley's Believe it or Not! with a local host. ABC 5 (now known as TV5) was the first to make it with Raymond Bagatsing as host. The show however was short-lived. * In 2008, GMA Network bought the rights and revived Ripley's Believe It or Not! in the Philippines. This time Chris Tiu of the Ateneo Blue Eagles was chosen as host. It is part of the \\"Bilib Ka Ba? Nights/Araw-araw\\" (\\"Do You Believe? Nights/Daily\\") block of the network which premiered on August 18, 2008. * Another revival titled Ripley's Believe It or Not!, with Bruce Campbell as the host, premiered on the Travel Channel in 2019. Internet and games * In 2006, the Ripleys.com website held a \\"Dear Mr. Ripley\\" contest in which contestants submitted \\"unbelievable\\" stories and with a public vote selecting a winner. The submissions included stories about a two-faced kitten, a car hurdler, a painting on human flesh canvas, a snake swallowing a golfball, an unopened deck of cards in a thin-necked bottle, a collector of Converse shoes with over 400 pairs, a man who survived a dumptruck falling on him, a painting made of nail polish, a child who played sports while hopping on a pogo stick, and a tongue swallower. The winners were announced on December 15, 2006. * In 2003, a Ripley's Believe It or Not! pinball machine was released. * The point and click adventure game Ripley's Believe It or Not!: The Riddle of Master Lu was published and developed by Sanctuary Woods, and released in 1995. Museums Ripley's Believe It Or Not museum at Innovative Film City in Bangalore, India When Ripley first displayed his collection to the public at the Chicago World's Fair in 1933, it was labeled Ripley's Odditorium and attracted over two million visitors during the run of the fair. (In an apparent promotional gimmick, beds were provided in the Odditorium for people who \\"fainted\\" daily.) That successful exhibition led to trailer shows across the country during the 1930s, and Ripley's collections were exhibited at many major fairs and expositions, including San Francisco, San Diego, Dallas, and Cleveland. In New York City, the famed Times Square exhibit opened in 1939 on Broadway. In 1950, a year after Ripley's death, the first permanent Odditorium opened in St. Augustine, Florida. The Odditorium is housed in the Castle Warden, built in 1888 by an associate of Henry Flagler, President of the Florida East Coast Railway. , there are 32 Ripley's Believe It or Not! Odditoriums around the world. Odditoriums, in the spirit of Believe It or Not!, are often more than simple museums cluttered with curiosities. Some include theaters and arcades, such as the ones in Gatlinburg, Tennessee and Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin. Others are constructed oddly, such as the Orlando, Florida Odditorium which is built off-level as if the building is sinking. Expected to open summer 2016 is the first Odditorium in the Netherlands,at Dam square in Amsterdam.

It also has a moving 4-D theater. * St. Augustine ‚Äì It is the oldest Ripley's Believe It or Not! and is located in the Castle Warden, was purchased shortly after his death in 1949 and opened in 1950. Before becoming home to his vast collections from his many travels, \\"The Castle\\", as it is known, was once a hotel which played host to many famous guests, including Ripley and author/owner Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings. It was originally a Moorish Revival style mansion, built in 1887 by millionaire William Warden as a winter home. Its popularity and success led Ripley's associates to open new establishments throughout the United States and the world. Perhaps not surprisingly, it is rumored to be haunted. Segments of the most recent Ripley's TV series were filmed here, including the opening credits. Among the attractions here are a mummified cat, a 1/12 scale model of the original Ferris wheel made out of erector sets, life and death masks of famous celebrities (including Abraham Lincoln), and shamanistic apparati from cultures around the world.

Also in Myrtle Beach you will find one of their 5D Motion Theaters, a mirror maze, Ripley's Haunted Adventure, and Ripley's Aquarium of Myrtle Beach.  Tennessee  * Gatlinburg ‚Äì The original museum, built in 1970, was destroyed by a massive fire caused by a faulty light fixture in a neighboring shop on July 14, 1992. It had to be completely rebuilt. Some of Ripley's most prized and unique possessions were consumed by the blaze. The current museum opened in 1994, with a tribute to the city's firefighters included among the collections. Artifacts salvaged from the blaze sport \\"I Survived the Fire\\" decals. It also has nearly twice the amount of exhibit space as the original. As with some other Ripley museums, it has a theme. It looks as if it has survived a major earthquake. Its interior and exterior feature cracks throughout, adhering to the theme. The Ripley's Company has since opened several other attractions in the area, including a \\"four-dimensional\\" theater, a state-of-the-art aquarium, a haunted factory, several arcades, two miniature golf courses, and a mirror maze all of which carry the Ripley's brand name and signature logo.

It reopened in the new Soul Centre on January 22, 2010, featuring a band of human oddities playing songs at the entrance. Inaccuracies Authorities at the company insist that they thoroughly investigate everything and ensure their accuracy before they publish their research. This is emphasized on its television show, where they often say \\"If you see it on Ripley's, you can bet that it's real\\". However, two claims appearing in their books have been dubbed \\"myths\\" by MythBusters. One claim which had previously appeared in Ripley's books, concerning an accidental execution of 1,200 Turkish prisoners ordered under Napoleon Bonaparte, has had its accuracy called into question by Snopes. Ripley's has reported the urban legend of Frank Tower - an individual who was supposed to have survived the sinkings of the RMS Titanic, RMS Empress of Ireland, and RMS Lusitania - as being factual. However, this story has been debunked by several sources. Ripley's has also repeated the myth that German was once one vote short of becoming the official language of the United States.

Older IEC standards were converted in 1997 by adding 60000, for example IEC 27 became IEC 60027 and the same standards are also published in the EN 60000 series to indicate adoption by CENELEC as a European standard; for example IEC 60034 is also available as EN 60034. Regional European standards issued by CENELEC, and which are not adopted IEC standards, are numbered in the EN 50000 series. , more than 90% of the standards passed by CENELEC used the Dresden Agreement process. The alternative process in which a member National Committee proposes a standard is called the Vilamoura process (or procedure). The Dresden Agreement was updated with the Frankfurt Agreement in October 2016,CENELEC Cooperation with IEC and decisions are detailed in CENELEC Guide 13 (2016).

If a proposal does not pass this way, a second vote taking into account only EU members is taken, with the threshold again being 71%.

The species in the Macrouridae are characterised by their large heads which normally have a single barbel on the chin, projecting snouts, and slender bodies that taper to whip-like tails, without an obvious caudal fin but what there is of the caudal fin is often confluent with the posterior dorsal and anal fins. There are normally two dorsal fins, the anterior dorsal fin is quite high, the posterior quite low but is longer and takes up a greater proportion of the fish's of the back, species in the subfamily Macrouroidinae have a single dorsal fin. The long anal fin is almost as long as the second dorsal fin is nearly as long as the posterior dorsal, and sometimes it is longer. The pelvic fin is inserted in the vicinity of the thorax and normally has 5-17 fin rays but are absent in Macrouroides. The body is covered in small scales and if they have a photophore, it is usually on the midline of the abdomen just in front of the anus. The bioluminescence of these fish is produced by symbiotic bioluminescent bacteria. The structure of the skull has been used to show their placing in the Gadiformes, but they differ from the typical cods in that they possess one stout spine in the anterior dorsal fin. The species in this family are mainly benthopelagic, they are found at depths of 200‚Äì2000 m, they occur on the sea bed and have a wide distribution from the Arctic to the Antarctic. The species in the Macrouridae normally live near the sea bed on the continental slope, however, some species are bathypelagic or mesopelagic, other species occur on the outer continental shelf. Their bodies are loose in texture rather than firm and they are weak swimmers. Some species are of commercial importance to fisheries.

Naval vessels coming into port for maintenance would be 'descended upon' by crews in the port's maintenance yard. Hence, the ship's crew referred to them as \\"yardbirds\\". \\"Yardbird\\" was the nickname given to two B-17 Flying Fortress bombers of the United States Air Force that flew combat missions over Europe during the Second World War. Both bombers were based at RAF Molesworth in England, as part of the 303d Bombardment Group (Heavy): \\"Yardbird\\" (41-24602), piloted by captain John W.

In mathematics, a discrete subgroup of a topological group G is a subgroup H such that there is an open cover of G in which every open subset contains exactly one element of H ; in other words, the subspace topology of H in G is the discrete topology. For example, the integers, Z, form a discrete subgroup of the reals, R (with the standard metric topology), but the rational numbers, Q, do not. A discrete group is a topological group G equipped with the discrete topology. Any group can be given the discrete topology. Since every map from a discrete space is continuous, the topological homomorphisms between discrete groups are exactly the group homomorphisms between the underlying groups. Hence, there is an isomorphism between the category of groups and the category of discrete groups. Discrete groups can therefore be identified with their underlying (non-topological) groups. There are some occasions when a topological group or Lie group is usefully endowed with the discrete topology, 'against nature'. This happens for example in the theory of the Bohr compactification, and in group cohomology theory of Lie groups. A discrete isometry group is an isometry group such that for every point of the metric space the set of images of the point under the isometries is a discrete set. A discrete symmetry group is a symmetry group that is a discrete isometry group. Properties Since topological groups are homogeneous, one need only look at a single point to determine if the topological group is discrete. In particular, a topological group is discrete if and only if the singleton containing the identity is an open set. A discrete group is the same thing as a zero-dimensional Lie group (uncountable discrete groups are not second- countable so authors who require Lie groups to satisfy this axiom do not regard these groups as Lie groups). The identity component of a discrete group is just the trivial subgroup while the group of components is isomorphic to the group itself. Since the only Hausdorff topology on a finite set is the discrete one, a finite Hausdorff topological group must necessarily be discrete. It follows that every finite subgroup of a Hausdorff group is discrete. A discrete subgroup H of G is cocompact if there is a compact subset K of G such that HK = G. Discrete normal subgroups play an important role in the theory of covering groups and locally isomorphic groups. A discrete normal subgroup of a connected group G necessarily lies in the center of G and is therefore abelian. Other properties: *every discrete group is totally disconnected *every subgroup of a discrete group is discrete. *every quotient of a discrete group is discrete. *the product of a finite number of discrete groups is discrete. *a discrete group is compact if and only if it is finite. *every discrete group is locally compact. *every discrete subgroup of a Hausdorff group is closed. *every discrete subgroup of a compact Hausdorff group is finite. Examples * Frieze groups and wallpaper groups are discrete subgroups of the isometry group of the Euclidean plane. Wallpaper groups are cocompact, but Frieze groups are not. * A crystallographic group usually means a cocompact, discrete subgroup of the isometries of some Euclidean space. Sometimes, however, a crystallographic group can be a cocompact discrete subgroup of a nilpotent or solvable Lie group. * Every triangle group T is a discrete subgroup of the isometry group of the sphere (when T is finite), the Euclidean plane (when T has a Z + Z subgroup of finite index), or the hyperbolic plane. * Fuchsian groups are, by definition, discrete subgroups of the isometry group of the hyperbolic plane. ** A Fuchsian group that preserves orientation and acts on the upper half-plane model of the hyperbolic plane is a discrete subgroup of the Lie group PSL(2,R), the group of orientation preserving isometries of the upper half- plane model of the hyperbolic plane. ** A Fuchsian group is sometimes considered as a special case of a Kleinian group, by embedding the hyperbolic plane isometrically into three-dimensional hyperbolic space and extending the group action on the plane to the whole space. ** The modular group PSL(2,Z) is thought of as a discrete subgroup of PSL(2,R). The modular group is a lattice in PSL(2,R), but it is not cocompact. * Kleinian groups are, by definition, discrete subgroups of the isometry group of hyperbolic 3-space. These include quasi-Fuchsian groups. ** A Kleinian group that preserves orientation and acts on the upper half space model of hyperbolic 3-space is a discrete subgroup of the Lie group PSL(2,C), the group of orientation preserving isometries of the upper half-space model of hyperbolic 3-space. * A lattice in a Lie group is a discrete subgroup such that the Haar measure of the quotient space is finite.

The Telezapper was created by Privacy Technologies, Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Appliance Mfg. Co.  Background  Telemarketing companies typically use predictive dialers to place many calls simultaneously. When the equipment detects that someone has answered one of the many calls it has made, it quickly transfers that call to an available agent. Unanswered calls, or numbers that are disconnected, are not transferred to agents and the call is terminated automatically. In this way, the agent is spared the time of dialing a call and waiting for an answer, and can simply speak to waiting calls that have been already set up. Additionally, if a number is determined to be disconnected, the equipment will usually mark that number as such and will not dial it again or as often.  How it works  The TeleZapper is an appliance that plugs into a consumer telephone line. On detecting a ring and answer of any phone on the line, the Telezapper will immediately play a sequence of Special information tones or \\"SIT\\": one of eight internationally standardized signals that indicate a call cannot be completed. Typically the \\"Intercept\\" or \\"IC\\" SIT is used, indicating the number called has been disconnected or changed. By playing this tone signal on the line, a predictive dialer calling the household would hear it, assume the number was disconnected, terminate the call and likely mark the number as \\"disconnected\\" in its database. This \\"tricking\\" of the telemarketer's equipment was effectively highlighted in marketing material for the TeleZapper as a way to get revenge on the \\"obnoxious telemarketers\\". The device is powered by a CR2032 battery, which is not documented in the manual and is replaced by opening the unit.  Limitations of the TeleZapper  A predictive dialer merely checks for three conditions: *A SIT signal, as described above, *a short response, like \\"hello\\", in which case it puts the called person through to a salesperson, and *a long response, such as an answering machine message, in which case it hangs up and re-queues the number to call back later or leaves a sales message. Some telemarketing firms have turned off the SIT tone detector altogether in response to the TeleZapper trick, rendering it wholly ineffective. Another limitation is that the device does not work well with voice mail systems. This is because voice mail reroutes the call from a physical line to the voice mail service without the phone ever picking up.

Beginning in the late 1830s, this society evolved into a separate, militaristic band that played a dominant role in Cheyenne resistance to the westward expansion of the United States in Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, and Wyoming, where the Cheyenne had settled in the early nineteenth century. After the deaths of nearly half the Southern Cheyenne in the cholera epidemic of 1849, many of the remaining Masikota band joined the Dog Soldiers. It effectively became a separate band, occupying territory between the Northern and Southern Cheyenne. Its members often opposed policies of peace chiefs such as Black Kettle. In 1869, most of the band were killed by United States Army forces in the Battle of Summit Springs. The surviving societies became much smaller and more secretive in their operations. In the twenty-first century, there has been a revival of the Dog Soldiers society in such areas as the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation in Montana and among the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes in Oklahoma.  Cheyenne tribal governance  The two central institutions of traditional Cheyenne tribal governance are the Council of Forty-FourGreene 2004, p. 9. and the military societies, including the Dog Soldiers. The Council of Forty-Four is the council of chiefs, comprising four chiefs from each of the ten Cheyenne bands, plus four principalHoig 1980, p. 11. or \\"Old Man\\" chiefs, known to have had previously served with distinction on the council. While chiefs are responsible for overall governance of individual bands and the tribe as a whole, the headmen of warrior societies are charged with maintaining discipline within the tribe, overseeing tribal hunts and ceremonies, and providing military leadership. Dog Soldiers Historically, Dog Soldiers have been regarded as both highly aggressive and effective combatants. One tradition recalls that in battle, they would \\"pin\\" themselves to a \\"chosen\\" piece of ground, through an unusually long breech- clout \\"rear-apron\\", by use of one of three \\"Sacred Arrows\\" that they traditionally carried into battle.  Emergence as a separate band =Porcupine Bear Prior to the peace council held at Bent's Fort in 1840, the Algonquian-speaking Southern Cheyenne and Arapaho were allied against their traditional enemies, the Comanche, Kiowa, and Plains Apache, who belonged to different language families and cultures. In 1837, while raiding the Kiowa horse herds along the North Fork of the Red River, a party of 48 Cheyenne Bowstring Men were discovered and killed by Kiowa and Comanche warriors.Hoig 1980, p. 30. Porcupine Bear, chief of the Dog Soldiers, took up the war pipe of the Cheyenne. He carried it to the various Cheyenne and Arapaho camps to drum up support for revenge against the Kiowa. He reached a Northern Cheyenne camp along the South Platte River just after it had traded for liquor from American Fur Company men at Fort Laramie. Porcupine Bear joined in the drinking. He sat and sang Dog Soldier war songs. Two of his cousins, Little Creek and Around, became caught up in a drunken fight. Little Creek got on top of Around and held up a knife, ready to stab Around; at that point, Porcupine Bear, aroused by Around's calls for help, tore the knife away from Little Creek, and stabbed him with it several times. He forced Around to finish off Little Creek.Hyde 1968, p. 74.Hoig 1980, pp. 48-49. By the rules governing military societies, a man who murdered or accidentally killed another tribe member had blood on his hands and was prohibited from joining a society. A society member who committed such a crime was expelled and outlawed.Hyde 1968, p. 335. Porcupine Bear was expelled from the Dog Soldiers, and he and his relatives had to camp apart from the rest of the Cheyenne.Hoig 1980, p. 49. The Dog Soldiers were disgraced by Porcupine Bear's act. The other chiefs forbade them from leading war against the Kiowa. Wolf reformed the Bowstring Society, which had been nearly annihilated in the fight with the Kiowa. It took over leading warfare against the Kiowa.Hyde 1968, p. 75. Although outlawed by the main body of the Cheyenne, Porcupine Bear led the Dog Soldiers into battle against the Kiowa and Comanche at Wolf Creek. He and his warriors were reportedly the first to strike the enemy, considered an honor,Hyde 1968, p. 79. but due to their outlaw status, their feat was not celebrated. Dog Soldier band The outlawing of Porcupine Bear, his relatives, and his followers led to the transformation of the Dog Soldiers from a warrior society into a separate division of the tribe.Hyde 1968, p. 338. In the wake of the cholera epidemic in 1849, which greatly reduced the Masikota band of Cheyenne,Hyde 1968, p. 97. the remaining Masikota joined the Dog Soldiers. When the Cheyenne bands camped together, the Dog Soldier band took the position in the camp circle formerly occupied by the Masikota.Hyde 1968, p. 339. Prominent or ambitious warriors from other bands also gradually joined the Dog Soldier band. Over time, the Dog Soldiers took a prominent leadership role in the wars against the whites. The rest of the tribe began to regard them with respect and no longer as outlaws. The Dog Soldiers contributed to the breakdown of the traditional matrilineal clan system of the Cheyennes. Customarily when a man married, he moved to the camp of his wife's band. Maintaining their separation, the Dog Soldiers brought all wives to their own camp. Other elements contributing to the breakdown of the traditional clan system were the high rate of deaths from the 1849 cholera epidemic, which killed perhaps half the Southern Cheyenne population,Hyde 1968, p. 96. particularly devastating the Masikota band and nearly wiping out the Oktoguna. Losses in the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864 further disrupted the traditional Cheyenne kinship system. The Third Colorado Cavalry caused heavy casualties among the Wutapai (Black Kettle's band); and killed perhaps half of the Hevhaitaniu under Yellow Wolf and Big Man, and half the Oivimana under War Bonnet. They also killed many among the Hisiometanio (Ridge Men) under White Antelope. The Dog Soldiers and the Masikota, who by that time operated as a band, were not at Sand Creek during the massacre.Hyde 1968, p. 159. The Dog Soldiers band took as its territory the headwaters country of the Republican and Smoky Hill rivers in southern Nebraska, northern Kansas, and the northeast of Colorado Territory.Greene 2004, p. 26.Hoig 1980, p. 85. They were allies of the Sioux-speaking Lakota and Brul√© Lakota, who also frequented that area. The Cheyenne began to intermarry with the Lakota in that territory. Many Dog Soldiers were half-Lakota, including their leader Tall Bull. During the mid-1860s, Dog Soldier leaders, including Tall Bull and White Horse, frequently called on the great warrior Roman Nose, a Crooked Lance society member, to lead Dog Soldier strikes against white civilian and military assets. He led an attack on Fort Wallace in June 1867. Due to an increasing division between the Dog Soldiers and the council chiefs with respect to policy toward the whites, the Dog Soldiers became separated from the other Southern Cheyenne bands.Greene 2004, p. 27. They effectively became a third division of the Cheyenne people, between the Northern Cheyenne, who ranged north of the Platte River, and the Southern Cheyenne, who occupied the area north of the Arkansas River. A strong band numbering perhaps 100 lodges, the Dog Soldiers were hostile to the encroaching whites. By the 1860s, as conflict between Indigenous people and whites intensified, the militaristic Dog Soldiers increased their influence, together with that of the warrior societies of other Cheyenne bands. The warriors became a significant counter influence to the leadership of the traditional Council of Forty-Four chiefs, who as generally more mature men, were likely to favor working for peace with the whites.  Indian wars  In the late 1860s, the Dog Soldiers were crucial in Cheyenne resistance to the expansion into their territory. Dog Soldiers refused to sign treaties that limited their hunting grounds and restricted them to a reservation south of the Arkansas River. They attempted to hold their traditional lands at Smoky Hill, but the campaigns of General Philip Sheridan foiled these efforts. After the Battle of Beecher's Island, many Dog Soldiers were forced to retreat south of the Arkansas River. In the spring of 1867 they returned north with the intention of joining Red Cloud and his Oglala band in Powder River. Attacked by General Eugene Carr, the Dog Soldiers began raiding settlements on Smoky Hill River in revenge. Eventually, Chief Tall Bull led them west into Colorado. After raiding sites in Kansas, they were attacked by a force composed of Pawnee Scouts led by Major Frank North, and United States cavalry, who killed 23 of an estimated 450 Cheyenne warriors (5%), including Tall Bull, in the Battle of Summit Springs in June 1869.

Sepang District covers an area of around 600 square kilometres, and had a population of 190,889 in the 2010 Census (excluding foreigners). The district of Sepang is also famous for the township of Cyberjaya, which is also known as the Silicon Valley of Malaysia vis-√†-vis its association with the MSC Malaysia. The capital of Sepang district is Salak Tinggi, which took over from Sepang town. The remaining areas of Puchong, such as Bukit Puchong 2, 16 Sierra, Pulau Meranti, Bandar Nusaputra, Taman Putra Perdana, Taman Putra Prima, Taman Meranti Jaya and Taman Mas, are located in this district. History Sepang district was formed from parts of the adjacent constituencies of Hulu Langat (Kajang) and Kuala Langat on 1 January 1975; though there was already a Sepang constituency in parliament as early as 1959. Sepang gained municipal status in 2005. Geography Sepang district is situated in the southern part of Selangor.

With the rise in Anglophone media and global spread of British and American cultures in the 20th and 21st centuries, many English terms have entered popular usage in other tongues. Technology-related English words like internet and computer are particularly common across the globe, as there are no pre-existing words for them. English words are sometimes imported verbatim, and sometimes adapted to the importing language in a process similar to anglicisation. In languages with non-Latin alphabets, these borrowed words can be written in the Latin alphabet anyway, resulting in a text made up of a mixture of scripts; other times they are transliterated. Transliteration of English and other foreign words into Japanese generally uses the katakana script. In some countries such anglicisation is seen as relatively benign, and the use of English words may even take on a chic aspect. In Japan, marketing products for the domestic market often involves using English or pseudo- English brand names and slogans. In other countries, anglicisation is seen much more negatively, and there are efforts by public-interest groups and governments to reverse the trend. It is also important to note that while Anglicism is fundamentally rooted in the word English, the process does not necessarily denote anglicisms from England. It can also involve terms or words from all varieties of English so that it becomes necessary to use the term Americanism for the loan words originating from the United States.  Definitions  Definitions what an Anglicisms is differs significantly across various fields. The word is employed in various situations of language contact. The criteria for being considered an Anglicism by the Usage Dictionary of Anglicisms in Selected European Languages are as follows: a loanword that is recognisably English in form with regards to spelling, pronunciation and morphology. In this specific sense, loan translations and calques are excluded (as well as words that are etymologically derived from languages related to modern French). Some see Anglicisms as harmless and useful, others perceive them as bad influences to be countered. Other definitions of Anglicism include: a word or construction peculiar to English; a word or phrase that is peculiar to British English; or English syntax, grammar, or meaning transposed in another language resulting in incorrect language use or incorrect translation.  Adaptation  A number of scholars agree that for Anglicism to take place, adaptation must first occur such as in the case of the integration of a great number of Anglicisms in Europe. Fischer said that it is similar to neologism in the sense that it completes several phases of integration, which include: 1) the beginning, when it is still new and not known to many speakers; 2) the phase where it begins to spread and take part in the process of institutionalization; and, 3) the word becomes part of the common core of the language.Fischer, p. 8. There are experts who propose a more detailed framework such as the model of Anglicism adaptation that transpires on four levels: orthographic, phonological, morphological, and semantic.  By language =Chinese These are English terms, expressions, or concepts that have been absorbed into the Chinese language, including any of its varieties, and should not be confused with Chinglish, the variety of the English language used by native Chinese speakers. The origins of Chinese anglicisms vary, one of the most common being those obtained by phonetic borrowing. For example, a \\"bus\\" (, in Mainland China or Taiwan) is usually called in Hong Kong and Macao because its Cantonese pronunciation is similar to its English counterpart. Another type of anglicism is syntactic anglicism, when a sentence is rendered following the English word order instead of the standard Chinese word order; for example, the word for \\"network\\" is or , where can be translated as \\"net\\". Finnish The Anglicisms can be divided to four types: direct phonetic imitation, lexical and grammatical calques, and contamination of orthography. Official language (as given by the Language Planning Office) deprecates Anglicisms, and for the most part, native constructions are sufficient even in spoken language. Nevertheless, some Anglicisms creep in. Computer jargon is generally full of direct imitation, e.g. \\"swap\\". Other jargons with abundant Anglicisms are pop music, scifi, gaming, fashion, automobile and to some extent scientific jargon. This is regarded a sign of overspecialization, if used outside the context of the jargon. Generally, direct imitation is not as common, but there are examples. For example, the word sexy , pronounced with an Y unlike in English , might be used as an adjective. This is teenager-specific. Lexical calques take an English expression, like killer application, and produce , which does mean \\"an application that kills\\" just as in English. Readers need to know the equivalent English term to understand this. Some speakers, especially those in frequent contact with the English language have created a grammatical calque of the English you-impersonal. The English impersonal utilizes the second person pronoun you, e.g. You can't live if you don't eat. Here, the word you does not refer explicitly to the listener, but signifies a general statement. The same example is rendered in Finnish as , where a separate grammatical impersonal (also known as ) is used. When translated word-by-word, , it will refer directly to the listener. Here the contraction of spoken language is used instead of the of spoken language. Then, you will need to understand that it is an Anglicism, or you can be offended by the commanding \\"You there!\\" tone produced. (There are also native examples of the same construction, so the origin of this piece of grammar may not always be English.) An English orthographical convention is that compound words are written separately, whereas in Finnish, compound words are written together, using a hyphen with acronyms and numbers. In Finnish, and would be correct, but process engineering or Intel 80286 processor would not. Failure to join the words or omitting the hyphen can be either an honest mistake, or contamination from English. Another orthographical convention is that English words tend to be written as the originals. For example, the computer jargon term from to chat is written as (chat + frequentative), even if it is pronounced . The forms or are used, too. Sometimes, it is even standard language, e.g. , instead of according to English pronunciation . French A typical shopping centre in La Rochelle, in western France shows many examples of the English language A distinction is made between well- established English borrowings into French, and other words and structures regarded as incorrect. The term is often pejorative, carries a large amount of political weight, and frequently denotes an excessive use of English in the French language. There are many words in French of English origin whose English roots are unknown or unrecognized due to lack of salience or length of time since borrowing, as well as other words which are seen as English but that are well accepted as part of French (ex: parking, week-end). Other examples include (pronounced ), (meaning \\"public square\\") or (meaning \\"melancholy\\" rather than the organ). These are not considered Anglicisms but are fully accepted as French words by the Acad√©mie Fran√ßaise. Occasionally governments and linguistic institutions of both Quebec and France have undertaken strenuous efforts to eradicate Anglicisms, often by suggesting French replacements with French phonology and morphology. Although efforts in Quebec have been met with some success (eg. for ), attempts by the Acad√©mie have largely been unsuccessful. Sociolinguists have attributed these failures to the general inability of linguistic institutions to enforce a linguistic norm. The Acad√©mie regularly updates a list of prescribed linguistic norms, many of which include using suggested French replacements instead of anglicisms (eg. for ). Replacements have taken many different forms. For example, in Quebec French, the portmanteau word is increasingly gaining acceptance. This neologism is a word coined from the words (\\"keyboard\\") and (\\"chat\\"). Other replacements have various forms created by the Acad√©mie and office qu√©b√©cois de la langue fran√ßaise. Quebec French and Metropolitan French tend to have entirely different Anglicisms for historical reasons. Quebec French acquired its Anglicisms in a gradual process of linguistic borrowing resulting from linguistic contact with English speakers for two and a half centuries since the Battle of the Plains of Abraham of 1759. Metropolitan French, on the other hand, mostly adopted its Anglicisms in recent decades due to the post-Second World War international dominance of English, or the rise of English as a lingua franca. Due to the differences between in English borrowings in Canada and France, the people of Quebec and France often consider each other's anglicisms to be incorrect or humorous while considering their own to be perfectly normal. An example of a Metropolitan French Anglicism not used in Quebec French: * : short for , but pronounced like the English word \\"sweet\\" An example of a Quebec French Anglicism not used in France; * : to French kiss Furthermore, the social meaning and acceptance of anglicisms differs from country to country due to the differences in the historical relationship to French. In Quebec, anglicisms are never used in formal documentation (government papers, instruction sheets) and very rarely used in informal writing (magazines, journals). In 1993, the French passed the legislation Loi Toubon which forbids the use of anglicisms (or those from other languages) in commercial and government publications. In both countries, wherever the use of an Anglicism is unavoidable, it is often written in italics or in quotations. There are a number of different varieties of anglicisms which are largely differentiated on the way in which they entered the language. One type of anglicism is a calque, or a direct translation from English. For example, the valediction is regarded as an anglicism since it is a direct translation of the English \\"Sincerely yours.\\" Other anglicisms include the wholesale adoption of the English term such as \\"business\\" or \\"start-up\\". Additionally, some English words in French may not have the same meaning as those words in English. One example is the word \\"golf\\" which has an increased semantic field, referring to not just the game of golf but also a golf course as in \\"on va aller au golf\\" (trans: we're going to the golf course). Anglicism is a political term and does not necessarily indicate the etymology or history of the word itself. Rather, it indicates the common attitudes and perceptions about the (theoretically English) history of the word. For example, because English itself borrowed a great amount of French vocabulary after the Norman Conquest, some anglicisms are actually Old French words that dropped from usage in French over the centuries but were preserved in English and have now come full circle back into French. For instance, one attested origin of the verb \\"to flirt\\" cites influence from the Old French expression conter fleurette, which means \\"to (try to) seduce\\". (Other possible origins for the word include flit, E. Frisian flirt (a flick or light stroke) and E. Frisian flirtje (a giddy girl)). This expression is no longer used in French, but the English Gallicism \\"to flirt\\" has now returned to French and is considered an anglicism, despite its likely French origins. German Denglisch is a pejorative term used in German describing the increased use of anglicisms and pseudo-anglicisms in the German language. It is a portmanteau of the German words (German) and . The term is first recorded from 1965.Lambert, James. 2018. A multitude of 'lishes': The nomenclature of hybridity. English World-wide, 39(1): 23. DOI: 10.1075/eww.38.3.04lam To some extent, the influence of English on German can be from normal language contact. The term Denglisch is however mostly reserved for forced, excessive exercises in anglicization, or pseudo-anglicization, of the German language. Italian Under Benito Mussolini, efforts were made to purify Italian of Anglicisms and other foreign words. Today, Italian is one of the most receptive languages for anglicisms.Universit√§t Regensburg (26‚Äì28 September 2006) \\"Anglicisms in Europe ‚Äì Universit√§t Regensburg\\" Universit√§t Regensburg. Retrieved 30 March 2013 Latvian The first anglicisisms in the written sources of Latvian appear at the end of the 18th century, however, up until the middle 1970s they were barely researched as their number remained low and since they mostly appeared in the terminology of sports and engineering. The direct contact between Latvian and English at that time was very limited, thus most of the anglicisms entered Latvian through German or Russian. Ever since Latvia regained its independence, there has been an influx of anglicisms into the Latvian language due to the fact that media in English is more accessible than ever. Polish Sporadic linguistic contacts between Polish and English-speaking areas have been noted at least since the 15th century. However, most early Anglicisms in Polish were mostly limited to names for places in Great Britain and the Americas. The first proper Anglicisms were also related to geography and were recorded in an 18th-century work by Franciszek Siarczy≈Ñski. By the end of that century there were at least 21 lexemes of English provenance in Polish usage. The 1859 dictionary of foreign words by Micha≈Ç Amszejewicz contains roughly 100 Anglicisms, the so-called Vilnian dictionary of 1861 contains roughly 180 of such words.Ma≈Ñczak- Wohlfeld, p. 32 The Anglicisms recorded in the 19th century were in large part words related to social, political, legal and economic concepts used in English society and lacking corresponding institutions in contemporary Poland. Another group were naval, sports-related and technical terms. Typically new words were initially being written in their original form, especially when they were used to describe English or American contexts. Such was the case of the word budget, first recorded as such in 1792 in relation to English economy, but soon also used in Polish context. With time the word was assimilated and remains in modern Polish dictionaries, written as bud≈ºet. Early 19th century Dictionary of the Polish Language by Samuel Linde includes the following Anglicisms: foksal (after London's suburb of Vauxhall; meaning an evening garden party in contemporary Polish), galon, klub, kwakier, piknik, poncz, rum and porter. The assimilation of new English words into Polish sped up in the 20th century and gradually English replaced Czech, German, French, Italian and other languages as the primary source of new imports into the Polish language. At the turn of the century there were roughly 250 English words in use, by 1961 the number of English lexemes in Polish rose to over 700, breaking 1000 lexemes in the 1980s and at least 1600 in 1994. Borrowings from English language used in modern Polish fall into a number of thematic categories: * Science and technology: flesz, kompakt, komputer, kontener, stres, trend, walkman (used as a generic word for personal stereo rather than a trademark); * Sports and healthcare: aerobic, lifting, jogging, peeling, aut, badminton, bekhend, bobslej, debel, derby, doping, jockey, forhend, hokej, lider, mecz, net, outsider, ring, rugby, set, tenis, walkover; * Computers: driver, joystick, mysz (a semantic blueprint), serwer, skaner, spam; * Economy: bud≈ºet, biznes, biznesmen, broker, dyskont, holding, leasing, joint venture, menad≈ºer, marketing, sponsor, supermarket; * Fashion: d≈ºersey, d≈ºins, lycra, topless; * Politics: lobby, establishment * Daily life: baby- sitter, happy end, logo, marker, market, notebook, puzzle, ranking, snack bar, scrabble, show, teflon, weekend; * Maritime terms: kil, maszt, slup, spinaker, szekla, szkuner; * Food: cheeseburger, chipsy, dressing, fast food, grill, hamburger, hot dog, lunch, popcorn, tost Take note, that some of the borrowed words already have Polish equivalents and therefore are not recognized by all language users: menad≈ºer (manager) instead of kierownik quad (quad bike) instead of czteroko≈Çowiec monitoring (CCTV) instead of nadz√≥r, doz√≥r W czym mogƒô pom√≥c (English: How can I help you) instead of Czym mogƒô s≈Çu≈ºyƒá (English: How can I serve you). In addition to lexical borrowings, there is also a number of calques in everyday use. Spanish Spanglish (a portmanteau of the words \\"Spanish\\" and \\"English\\") is a name sometimes given to various contact dialects, pidgins, or creole languages that result from interaction between Spanish and English used by people who speak both languages or parts of both languages, mainly spoken in the United States. It is a blend of Spanish and English lexical items and grammar. Spanglish can be considered a variety of Spanish with heavy use of English or vice versa. It can be more related either to Spanish or to English, depending on the circumstances. Since Spanglish arises independently in each region, it reflects the locally spoken varieties of English and Spanish. In general different varieties of Spanglish are not necessarily mutually intelligible. In Mexican and Chicano Spanish the common term for \\"Spanglish\\" is \\"Pocho\\".

It originally shipped with Microsoft C 4.0 and later. It also shipped with Visual Basic for MS-DOS, Microsoft BASIC PDS, and a number of other Microsoft language products. It was one of the first debuggers on the DOS platform that was full-screen oriented, rather than line- oriented (as Microsoft's predecessors DEBUG and SYMDEB or Digital Research's SID). Overview When running, CodeView presents the user with several windows that can be tiled, moved, sized and otherwise manipulated via the keyboard or mouse, with CodeView 4.x providing a richer interface. Some of the windows include: * Code window ‚Äì the code window showed the currently debugged code in its source code context. * Data window ‚Äì a hexadecimal dump of a user- specified memory area. * Watch window ‚Äì a contextual display of variables by name. * Locals window ‚Äì a contextual display of variables local to the current function. * Command window ‚Äì user commands (using the same or similar syntax as DEBUG and SYMDEB) could be entered here. * Assembly window ‚Äì the assembly (machine code) was displayed, allowing for single-stepping through functions. * Register window ‚Äì to visualize the 80x86 register contents, including segments, flags and the FPU (CodeView existed before MMX and other SIMD extensions). * Output window ‚Äì a window showing startup operations and debugging information relating to breakpoints, hardware breaks (interrupt 0 and 3), etc. Features * 386 mode ‚Äì 8086, 80286 and 80386 and later processors. 386 enhanced mode is activated by a menu option, allowing for 32-bit registers and disassembly. * Monochrome monitor support ‚Äì allows debugging on either a single color (CGA, EGA or VGA) monitor with page/memory swapping between the user application and the CodeView screen, or using a separate monochrome monitor. The monochrome monitor exists in memory address space 0xb0000, while the color monitor exists at 0xb8000 for text and 0xa0000 for graphics. Use of the monochrome monitor with its separate memory address space allows debugging graphics applications without affecting the display, as well as all text modes. Monochrome monitors are limited to 25 lines, whereas color monitors allow 25, 43 or 50 line mode, allowing for more information on the screen at the same time. Creating symbolic debugging output, which allows memory locations to be viewed by their programmer-assigned name, along with a program database showing the source code line related to every computer instruction in the binary executable, is enabled by the command line switch -Zi given to the compiler, and -CO given to the linker. Variants like -Zs and -Zd provide lesser information, and smaller output files which, during the early 1990s, were important due to limited machine resources, such as memory and hard disk capacity. Many systems in those days had 8MB of memory or less. CodeView handles all program models, including TINY, SMALL, COMPACT, MEDIUM, LARGE and HUGE, with TINY (DOS-based .COM files) having their symbolic debugger information stored in a separate file, with all of the other .EXE formats containing the symbolic information directly inside the executable. This often introduced a notable size increase, and it therefore became desirable for some developers to use #pragma switches within their C (and later C++) source code to prevent the majority of the application from having symbolic output, and instead limiting that output to only those portions which required it for current debugging. CodeView version 3.x and 4.x introduced various transport layers, which removed some of the memory space limitations to this form of symbolic debugging. Typically the debugger runs in the lower 640KB memory space alongside the application being debugged, which greatly decreases the amount of memory available to the application being debugged. The transport layer allows only a stub to exist in main memory, while the bulk of the debugger code resides in EMS or XMS (memory above the 1 MB barrier, or outside of the normal 0 KB - 640 KB address space typically used by DOS programs). CodeView also came with a CVPACK command-line utility, which can reduce the size of the CodeView-generated information internally, while still retaining full symbolic access to data. Visual C++ support Microsoft released Visual C++ 1.0 with CodeView functionality integrated directly into a single programming environment, known as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) -- though CodeView was still available in the 16-bit versions of Visual C++. QuickC and a number of other development tools in the 'Quick' series also supported this move to a single-source IDE, what became the precursor to the modern Visual Studio developer environment, as well as the model for countless other developer toolsets. This integration was seen by many developers as a more natural way of developing software because both coding and debugging could be handled without switching programs or context, and all from the same logical location (even though internally many separate programs were running to support editing, compiling and debugging). As a result, most development tools and/or platforms offer similar products or features. Today, the debugger is considered an integrated and essential part of the Microsoft Visual Studio family of products, and owes its true roots to CodeView, and the enhancements seen in version 4.x specifically. Symdeb Another debugging product available from Microsoft in the mid-1980s was SYMDEB. It had over 30 commands, and was described by PC Magazine as a step up from DEBUG. Codeview in turn was described as \\"a fullscreen SYMDEB\\".

Compatible play-back equipment (a projector with modified lens, or a digital video player or set-top box) can then expand the horizontal dimension to show the original widescreen image. This is typically used to allow one to store widescreen images on a medium that was originally intended for a narrower ratio, while using as much of the frame - and therefore recording as much detail - as possible. The technique comes from cinema, when a film would be framed and recorded as widescreen but the picture would be \\"squashed together\\" using a special concave lens to fit into non-widescreen 1.37:1 aspect ratio film. This film can then be printed and manipulated like any other 1.37:1 film stock, although the images on it will appear to be squashed horizontally (or elongated vertically). An anamorphic lens on the projector in the cinema (a convex lens) corrects the picture by performing the opposite distortion, returning it to its original width and its widescreen aspect ratio. The optical scaling of the lens to a film medium is considered more desirable than the digital counterpart, due to the amount of non-proportional pixel-decimated scaling that is applied to the width of an image to achieve (something of a misnomer) a so-called \\"rectangular\\" pixel widescreen image. The legacy ITU Rec. 601 4:3 image size is used for its compatibility with the original video bandwidth that was available for professional video devices that used fixed clock rates of a SMPTE 259M serial digital interface. One would produce a higher-quality upscaled 16:9 widescreen image by using either a 1:1 SD progressive frame size of 640√ó360 or for ITU Rec. 601 and SMPTE 259M compatibility a letterboxed frame size of 480i or 576i. Similar operations are performed electronically to allow widescreen material to be stored on formats or broadcast on systems that assume a non-widescreen aspect ratio, such as DVD or standard definition digital television broadcasting. Film Many commercial films (especially epics - usually with the CinemaScope 2.35:1 optical sound or the older 4-track mag sound 2.55:1 aspect ratio) are recorded on standard 35 mm ~4:3 aspect ratio film, using an anamorphic lens to horizontally compress all footage into a ~4:3 frame. Another anamorphic lens on the movie theatre projector corrects (optically decompresses) the picture (see anamorphic format for details). Other movies (often with aspect ratios of 1.85:1 in the USA or 1.66:1 in Europe) are made using the simpler matte technique, which involves both filming and projecting without any expensive special lenses. The movie is produced in 1.375 format, and then the resulting image is simply cropped in post-production (or perhaps in the theater's projector) to fit the desired aspect ratio of 1.85:1 or 1.66:1 or whatever is desired. Besides costing less, the main advantage of the matte technique is that it leaves the studio with \\"real\\" footage (the areas that are cropped for the theatrical release) which can be used in preference to pan-and-scan when producing 4:3 DVD releases, for example. The anamorphic encoding on DVD is related to the anamorphic filming technique (like CinemaScope) only by name. For instance, Star Wars (1977) was filmed in 2.39:1 ratio using an anamorphic camera lens, and shown in theaters using the corresponding projector lens. Since it is a widescreen film, when encoded on a widescreen-format DVD the studio would almost certainly use the anamorphic encoding process. Monty Python and the Holy Grail was filmed in 1.85:1 ratio without using an anamorphic lens on the camera, and similarly was shown in theaters without the need for the decompression lens. However, since it is also a widescreen film, when encoded on a widescreen-format DVD the studio would probably use the anamorphic encoding process. It does not matter whether the filming was done using the anamorphic lens technique: as long as the source footage is intended to be widescreen, the digital anamorphic encoding procedure is appropriate for the DVD release. As a sidenote, if a purely non-widescreen version of the analog-anamorphic Star Wars were to be released on DVD, the only options would be pan-and-scan or hardcoded 4:3 letterboxing (with the black letterboxes actually encoded as part of the DVD data). If you were to release a purely non-widescreen version of Monty Python, you would have those options, as well as the additional option of an \\"open-matte\\" release, where the film footage that was never visible in theaters (due to use of the matte technique in post- production or in the theatrical projectors) is \\"restored\\" to the purely non- widescreen DVD release. Laserdisc While not anamorphic widescreen per se, many of the earliest Laserdisc offerings forewent the pan-and-scan cropping typical of home releases at the time, the mastering-technicians opting instead to simply squeeze the film‚Äôs original aspect ratio down to 4:3. While this resulted in an image that was overly compressed on standard televisions, many later HDTVs can stretch out this picture, thus restoring the correct aspect ratio. Later during the 1990s, a handful of Laserdiscs were released with proper anamorphic transfers. Four were released in the US as promotional items with Toshiba 16:9 TV sets (Unforgiven, Free Willy, The Fugitive, Grumpy Old Men), 12 were released commercially in Japan (marketed as SQUEEZE LD) as derived products from the MUSE/Hi-Vision releases. Three were commercially released in Germany PAL+ format (Schlafes Bruder, Showgirls, Mikrokosmos). Video was stretched vertically to fill the whole 4:3 picture of a Laserdisc (and add more information where black bars would be at the top and bottom) then either un-squeezed horizontally on a 16:9 TV set or using an anamorphic lens on a 4:3 video projector. DVD Video A DVD labeled as \\"Widescreen Anamorphic\\" contains video that has the same frame size in pixels as traditional fullscreen video, but uses wider pixels. The shape of the pixels is called pixel aspect ratio and is encoded in the video stream for a DVD player to correctly identify the proportions of the video. If an anamorphic DVD video is played on standard 4:3 television without adjustment, the image will look horizontally squeezed. Packaging Pre-2001 MGM Anamorphic DVD packaging sample. Pre-2003 Universal Anamorphic DVD packaging sample. Now used by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. Although currently there is no labeling standard, DVDs with content originally produced in an aspect ratio wider than 1.33:1 are typically labeled \\"Anamorphic Widescreen\\", \\"Enhanced for 16:9 televisions\\", \\"Enhanced for widescreen televisions\\", or similar. If not so labeled, the DVD is intended for a 4:3 display (\\"fullscreen\\"), and will be letterboxed or panned and scanned. There has been no clear standardization for companies to follow regarding the advertisement of anamorphically enhanced widescreen DVDs. Some companies, such as Universal and Disney, include the aspect ratio of the movie. Blu-ray video Unlike DVD, Blu-ray supports SMPTE HD resolutions of 720p and 1080i/p with a display aspect ratio of 16:9 and a pixel aspect ratio of 1:1, so widescreen video is scaled non- anamorphically (this is referred to as \\"square\\" pixels). Blu-ray also supports anamorphic wide-screen, both at the DVD-Video/D-1 resolutions of 720√ó480 (NTSC) and 720√ó576 (PAL), and at the higher resolution of 1440√ó1080 (source aspect ratio of 4:3, hence a pixel aspect ratio of 4:3 = 16:9 / 4:3 when used as anamorphic 16:9). See Blu-ray Disc: Technical specifications for details. Television Major digital television channels in Europe (for example, the five major UK terrestrial TV channels of BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5), as well as Australia, carry anamorphic widescreen programming in standard definition. In almost all cases, 4:3 programming is also transmitted on the same channel. The SCART switching signal can be used by a set-top-box to signal the television which kind of programming (4:3 or anamorphic) is currently being received, so that the television can change modes appropriately. The user can often elect to display widescreen programming in a 4:3 letterbox format instead of pan and scan if they do not have a widescreen television. TV stations and TV networks can also include Active Format Description (AFD) just as DVDs can. Many ATSC tuners (integrated or set-top box) can be set to respond to this, or to apply a user setting. This can sometimes be set on a per-channel basis, and often on a per-input basis, and usually easily with a button on the remote control. Unfortunately, tuners often fail to allow this on SDTV (480i-mode) channels, so that viewers are forced to view a small picture instead of cropping the unnecessary sides (which are outside of the safe area anyhow), or zooming to eliminate the windowboxing that may be causing a very tiny picture, or stretching/compressing to eliminate other format-conversion errors. The shrunken pictures are especially troublesome for smaller TV sets. Many modern HDTV sets have the capability to detect black areas in any video signal, and to smoothly re-scale the picture independently in both directions (horizontal and vertical) so that it fills the screen. However, some sets are 16:10 (1.6:1) like some computer monitors, and will not crop the left and right edges of the picture, meaning that all programming looks slightly (though usually imperceptibly) tall and thin. ATSC allows two anamorphic widescreen SDTV formats (interlaced and progressive scan) which are 704√ó480 (10% wider than 640√ó480); this is narrower than the 720√ó480 of DVD due to 16 pixels being consumed by overscan (nominal analogue blanking) ‚Äì see overscan: analog to digital resolution issues. The format can also be used for fullscreen programming, and in this case it is anamorphic with pixels slightly taller (10:11, or 0.91:1) than their width.

The standard 1932 Academy ratio changed the true aspect ratio of the image data to 1.375 when they made space for audio tracks, however, this is close enough to 4:3 that the difference is often glossed over.

She is best known for her 1960 book My Memories of Old Beijing (), a novelistic tribute to her childhood reminiscences of Beijing. Biography Lin was born in Osaka, Japan, where her father (of Jiaoling, Guangdong origin) worked as a merchant. Lin's parents moved first to Taiwan, before settling in Beijing when she was 5. She spent her next 25 years there. In Beijing, Lin graduated from the News and Broadcast Institute and became a journalist for Shijie Ribao (\\"World News Daily\\"). In 1948, Lin moved with her husband and family to Taiwan, where she became the editor of several important literary periodicals and newspapers, including the literary section of the United Daily News and The Literary Monthly, before eventually establishing her own publishing house. She would reside in Taiwan for the rest of her life. Altogether, she published some 18 books, including novels, short story collections, radio drama and children's literature, many of which deal with the feminine experience. Her most famous book remains My Memories of Old Beijing (1960). In it, Lin records in lively, evocative, first-person prose her childhood memories, ending with the death of her father, from the eyes of a precocious, impressionable young girl. Film adaptation In 1982, mainland Chinese director Wu Yigong made the film My Memories of Old Beijing based on her novel. The film won the Best Director Prize at the 3rd annual Golden Rooster Awards, as well as the Golden Eagle Prize (Best Feature Film) at the Manila International Film Festival in 1983. In 1999, it was chosen as one of the 100 best 20th-century Chinese-language films by Asia Weekly. Works Bibliography of Lin Haiyin's works available in English: *\\"Buried With the Dead.\\" Tr.

The concept of a right to life arises in debates on issues of capital punishment, war, abortion, euthanasia, police brutality, justifiable homicide, and animal rights. Various individuals may disagree on which areas this principle applies, including such issues previously listed. Abortion The term \\"right to life\\" is used in the abortion debate by those who wish to end the practice of abortion, or at least reduce the frequency of the practice,Solomon, Martha. \\"The Rhetoric of Right to Life: Beyond the Court's Decision\\" Paper presented at the Southern Speech Communication Association (Atlanta, Georgia, April 4‚Äì7, 1978) and in the context of pregnancy, the term right to life was advanced by Pope Pius XII during a 1951 papal encyclical: > Every human being, even the child in the womb, has the right to life > directly from God and not from his parents, not from any society or human > authority. Therefore, there is no man, no society, no human authority, no > science, no ‚Äúindication‚Äù at all whether it be medical, eugenic, social, > economic, or moral that may offer or give a valid judicial title for a > direct deliberate disposal of an innocent human life‚Ä¶ --- Pope Pius XII, > Address to Midwives on the Nature of Their Profession Papal Encyclical, > October 29, 1951.\\"Address to Midwives on the Nature of Their Profession\\", 29 > October 1951. Pope Pius XII. In 1966 the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) asked Fr. James T. McHugh to begin observing trends in abortion reform within the United States. The National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) was founded in 1967 as the Right to Life League to coordinate its state campaigns under the auspices of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.http://www.christianlifeandliberty.net/RTL.bmp K.M. Cassidy. \\"Right to Life.\\" In Dictionary of Christianity in America, Coordinating Editor, Daniel G. Reid. Downers Grove, Illinois: InterVarsity Press, 1990. pp. 1017,1018.\\"God's Own Party The Making of the Religious Right\\", pp. 113-116. . Daniel K. Williams. Oxford University Press. 2010. To appeal to a more broad- based, nonsectarian movement, key Minnesota leaders proposed an organizational model that would separate the NRLC from the direct oversight of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and by early 1973 NRLC Director Fr. James T. McHugh and his executive assistant, Michael Taylor, proposed a different plan, facilitating the NRLC move toward its independence from the Roman Catholic Church. Ethics and right to life Some utilitarian ethicists argue that the \\"right to life\\", where it exists, depends on conditions other than membership of the human species. The philosopher Peter Singer is a notable proponent of this argument. For Singer, the right to life is grounded in the ability to plan and anticipate one's future. This extends the concept to non- human animals, such as other apes, but since the unborn, infants and severely disabled people lack this, he states that abortion, painless infanticide and euthanasia can be \\"justified\\" (but are not obligatory) in certain special circumstances, for instance in the case of a disabled infant whose life would be one of suffering,Singer, Peter. Practical ethics Cambridge University Press (1993), 2nd revised ed., or if his parents didn't wish to raise him and no one wanted to adopt him. Bioethicists associated with disability rights and disability studies communities have argued that Singer's epistemology is based on ableist conceptions of disability. Capital punishment Opponents of capital punishment argue that it is a violation of the right to life, while its supporters argue that the death penalty is not a violation of the right to life because the right to life should apply with deference to a sense of justice. The opponents believe that capital punishment is the worst violation of human rights, because the right to life is the most important, and capital punishment violates it without necessity and inflicts to the condemned a psychological torture. Human rights activists oppose the death penalty, calling it \\"cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment\\", and Amnesty International considers it to be \\"the ultimate, irreversible denial of Human Rights\\". The United Nations General Assembly has adopted, in 2007, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016 non-binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium on executions, with a view to eventual abolition. Killings by law enforcement The International Human Rights Standards for Law Enforcement has created a system whereby it is recognised that international human rights law is binding upon all state actors, and that said state actors must know and be capable of applying international standards for human rights. The right to life is for the most part an inalienable right granted to every human upon the planet, however, there are certain situations in which state actors are required to take drastic action, which can result in civilians being killed by law enforcement agents. Appropriate occasions for killings by law enforcement are strictly outlined by the International Human Rights Standards for Law Enforcement. Any lethal action taken by law enforcement agents must be taken following a certain set of rules that have been set out in the 'Use of Force' section of the Pocket Book on Human Rights for the Police. The essential tenet of the Pocket Book surrounding the use of lethal force is that all other means of a non-violent nature should be employed initially, followed by proportionately appropriate use of force. Proportionately appropriate use of force can, and will in some circumstances, refer to lethal force if a law enforcement agent genuinely believes that ending the life of one civilian would result in the preservation of his life, or the lives of his fellow civilians, as is outlined in the ' Circumstances for the Use of Firearms' section of the Pocket Book. The Pocket Book also outlines in the 'Accountability for the Use of Force and Firearms' section that there are stringent measures of accountability in place to maintain integrity within state law enforcement agencies as regards their right to the use of lethal force. International institutions have outlined when and where law enforcement agents might have the availability of lethal force at their disposal. The International Association of Chiefs of Police have 'Model Policies' which incorporate various pieces of information from leading sources. One of these model policies states that law enforcement agents will engage in reasonable necessary force to efficiently bring a scenario to a conclusion, giving specific thought to both the safety of themselves and other civilians. Law enforcement officers are given the prerogative to engage in department- approved methods to safely bring a conclusion to a scenario and are also given the ability to use issued equipment to resolve issues in scenarios where they are required to protect themselves or others from damage, to bring resistant individuals under control, or to safely conclude unlawful incidents. There is no mention as to what \\"reasonably necessary\\" should be interpreted as meaning, but there is reference made to the reasonable man method of determining how one should approach a scenario. However, it has been highlighted through events such as the killing of Michael Brown by Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, which resulted in public unrest, that there is confusion and debate surrounding the use of firearms and lethal force. The 'Procedure for the Use of Firearms' section provides the process through which law enforcement agents must progress when using firearms. It states that they must identify themselves as a law enforcement agent, issue a clear warning, and give an adequate amount of time for response (providing that time would not likely result in harm being done to the agent or other civilians) before deadly force can be used within the bounds of international law. While the Pocket Book on Human Rights for the Police outlines the academic circumstances under which law enforcement agents may use lethal force, the literal scenarios in which police killings have occurred are also relevant. RosenfeldRichard Rosenfeld, Founders Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. states that there is considerable literature that gives reason to believe that social conditions also have a part to play in how law enforcement killings can occur. Rosenfeld states that there are numerous studies that have been conducted which link law enforcement agents' use of lethal force to the area's rate of violent crime, the size of the non- indigenous population and the socioeconomic position of the community concerned. Appropriating a blanket description of how police killings can occur across the board is difficult given the vast differences in social context from state to state. Perry, Hall and HallAlison V. Hall, University of Texas-Arlington, Erika V. Hall, Emory University, Jamie L. Perry, Cornell University. discuss the phenomena across the United States of America which became highly charged and widely documented in late 2014, referring to the use of lethal force from white police officers on unarmed black male civilians. There is no legal prerogative which gives law enforcement agents the ability to use lethal force based on the race of the person they are dealing with, there is only a legal prerogative to engage in lethal force if there is a reasonable fear for your life or the lives of others. However, the Propublica analysis of federal data on fatal police shootings between 2010 and 2012, showed that young black male civilians were 21 times more likely to be killed by police than young white male civilians. The use of lethal force from law enforcement agents in the United States created widespread feeling amongst US citizens that they were not being protected by the police. The justice system mostly found that these agents acted within the boundaries of the law because the actions of the people who were shot were judged to be sufficiently questionable in character for the police officer to fear for their own life or the lives of others. CoppoloAttorney George Coppolo, Chief Attorney for the Connecticut General Assembly's Office of Legislative Research. investigated Connecticut law and reported that the use of lethal force must be followed by a report that determines whether the law enforcement agent's lethal force was proportionately necessary in the circumstances. Coppolo also stated that a reasonable lethal response must only be made when there is a reasonable belief that the facts you have been presented with could realistically result in a risk of death or grievous bodily harm. In Graham v. Connor,Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989). a diabetic who was suffering from a blood-sugar episode was detained by an officer who witnessed circumstances that made him suspicious of Graham, the detaining of Graham resulted in multiple injuries to Graham, who then proceeded to sue the police for use of excessive force. The US Supreme Court did not find a diabetic episode in of itself to be potentially threatening to a law enforcement agent. The Supreme Court did find that the totality of circumstances must be considered at the time of the incident when judging the officer rather than considering the incident with carefully considered hindsight, which in the case of Graham's episode it was decided that the diabetic induced behavior on the face of it could be considered threatening to a law enforcement agent or other civilians. This makes it difficult to ascertain what constitutes a fair description of a valid scenario in which a law enforcement agent might use lethal force. In Tennessee v. GarnerTennessee v. Garner, 471 U.S. 1 (1985). officer Elton Hymon answered a burglary call; when he entered the backyard of the property in question, Hymon witnessed somebody fleeing and ordered the suspect, later identified as a 15-year old boy named Edward Garner, to stop. Garner began climbing the fence, and Hymon proceeded to fatally shoot him in the back of the head. The Supreme Court held that in accordance with the Fourth Amendment, a law enforcement officer who is in pursuit of somebody cannot use lethal force to conclude the pursuit unless the officer has reasonable belief that the person poses a significant threat of harm to the officer or others. In the United States where the Second Amendment grants civilians the right to bear arms, any one person could pose a threat to a police officer's life or other civilians, as feasibly, any one person could be concealing a firearm. In New Zealand, the Annual Police Conduct ReportIndependent Police Conduct Authority Annual Report, 2011-2012, New Zealand. found that over a decade the police had shot and killed seven people, one of whom was innocent and all cases of which the police were found to have been acting within their legal rights. New Zealand has a strict process through which any citizen wanting to legally use a firearm must go through; this creates an environment through which the standard civilian does not pose a default threat to law enforcement agents' lives or the lives of others. The standard to which international law expects states to operate is the same across the board, lethal force must only be used by law enforcement agents when there is a real threat of harm to those law enforcement agents or other civilians. The reality is that each state is unique in what constitutes an appropriate situation for law enforcement agents to respond with lethal force due to states all around the world having their own unique environments, law, cultures and populations. Euthanasia The entitlement of a person to make the decision to end their own life through euthanasia is commonly called a right to choose,1999, Jennifer M. Scherer, Rita James Simon, Euthanasia and the Right to Die: A Comparative View, Page 27 while people who oppose the legalization of euthanasia are commonly referred to as the right-to-lifers.1998, Roswitha Fischer, Lexical Change in Present- day English, page 126 Juridical statements *In 1444, the Poljica Statute declared a right to live \\"-for nothing existed forever\\". *In 1776, the United States Declaration of Independence declared that \\"all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\\". *In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations General Assembly declared in article three: *In 1950, the European Convention on Human Rights was adopted by the Council of Europe, declaring a protected human right to life in Article 2.

Approximately 80,000 Shell employees are based in the U.S. Its U.S. headquarters are in Houston, Texas. Shell Oil Company, including its consolidated companies and its share in equity companies, is one of America's largest oil and natural gas producers, natural gas marketers, gasoline marketers and petrochemical manufacturers. Shell is the market leader through approximately 25,000 Shell- branded gas stations in the U.S. which also serve as Shell's most visible public presence. At its gas stations Shell provides diesel fuel, gasoline and LPG. Shell Oil Company was a 50/50 partner with the Saudi Arabian government- owned oil company Saudi Aramco in Motiva Enterprises, a refining and marketing joint venture which owns and operates three oil refineries on the Gulf Coast of the United States. However, Shell is currently divesting its interest in Motiva. The Shell Oil Company Warehouse, built, in 1925 and located at 425 S. N. 16th Ave. Phoenix, Arizona. It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Reference #85002073 Shell gas sign, also in Phoenix gas station near Lost Hills, California Shell products include oils, fuels, and car services as well as exploration, production, and refining of petroleum products. The Shell Oil Refinery in Martinez, California, the first Shell refinery in the United States, supplies Shell and Texaco stations in the West and Midwest. Shell gasoline previously included the RU2000 and SU2000 lines (later there was a SU2000E) but they have been superseded by the V-Power line. In 1997, Shell and Texaco entered into two refining/marketing joint ventures. One combined their Midwestern and Western operations and was known as Equilon. The other, known as Motiva Enterprises, combined the Eastern and Gulf Coast operations of Shell Oil and Star Enterprise, itself a joint venture between Saudi Aramco and Texaco. After Texaco merged with Chevron in 2001, Shell purchased Texaco's shares in the joint ventures. In 2002, Shell began converting these Texaco stations to the Shell brand, a process that was to be completed by June 2004 and was called \\"the largest retail re-branding initiative in American business history\\". In the year 2016, Shell Nederland Raffinaderij BV (Shell Pernis) said that it has started a new aromatics unit at the large Pernis refinery in Rotterdam, Netherlands. In recent years The Shell Oil Company's Midstream, and Downstream, in particular, have become limited to petroleum, and chemical products. This has come as a result of Royal Dutch Shell breaking off its Natural Gas and power businesses into a new segment named Integrated Gas. The Shell Oil Company's former Natural Gas, and energy divisions are now Shell Energy North America, a closely integrated, but a distinctive entity that runs across North America and is headquartered out of Houston. Relationship with Royal Dutch Shell Logos used by the Shell Oil Company between 1900 and 1999 Until the mid-1980s Shell's business in the United States was substantially independent. Limited direct involvement from the main office in The Hague, Netherlands and having its stock \\"Shell Oil\\" traded on the New York Stock Exchange were factors. However, in 1984, Royal Dutch Shell made a bid to purchase those shares of Shell Oil Company it did not own (around 30%) and despite some opposition from some minority shareholders which led to a court case, Shell completed the buyout for a sum of $5.7 billion. Despite the acquisition, however, Shell Oil remained a fairly independent business. This was due in part to complex legal reasons as Royal Dutch Shell feared that there could be onerous liability problems if a closer control of Shell Oil's affairs was exercised by the \\"parent company\\". One consequence of this independence was that the Shell logo used in the U.S. was slightly different from that used in the rest of the world. In the 1980s Shell Oil's independence began to gradually erode as the \\"parent company\\" took a more hands-on approach in running the business. The logo used in the United States is the same as that used elsewhere since June 1, 1998. In January 2018, Royal Dutch Shell acquired a 44% interest in solar energy company Silicon Ranch, run by CEO Matt Kisber. The takeover was part of the global New Energies project, with the aim of bringing solar renewable options to US customers. The company paid up to an estimated $217 million to take over from former minority shareholders Partners Group. In October 2018, the company installed 285-foot-high quench tower at the Shell Chemical Appalachia L.L.C. Pittsburgh plant, which transfers heat absorbed by the water circulation process to use across other areas of the site. Shell has companies in North, South and Central America: in Argentina, Aruba, Barbados, the Bahamas, Bolivia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, The Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Puerto Rico, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, the U.S. and Venezuela.

In 2008, a lawsuit was filed against Shell Oil Company for alleged Clean Air Act violation. Shell Deer Park facility, 20 miles east of Houston, was the nation's eighth-largest oil refinery and one of the world's largest petrochemical producers. The facility was also the second-largest source of air pollution in Harris County, which ranked among the lowest in the nation in several measures of air quality. According to Sierra Club and Environment Texas, analysis of Shell's reports to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, air pollutants released at Deer Park since 2003 exceeded the EPA's emissions limits. Will Oremus from Slate magazine states, \\"The company's business depends on being able to anticipate and respond quickly to seismic shifts in the energy market. So it employs a team of big-thinking futurists, called scenario planners, to keep it a step ahead. In 2008 the company released a fresh pair of scenarios for how the world might respond to climate change over the coming decades. Both were predicated on what the company called 'three hard truths': that global energy demand is rising, that the supply of conventional energy will not be able to keep up, and that climate change is both real and dangerous.\\" Polybutylene lawsuit Between 1978 and 1995, Shell Oil produced polybutylene pipes, which corrode when exposed to chlorine. A class action lawsuit was filed in 1995 against Shell Oil when the polybutylene pipes caused flooding in many households in the U.S. and Canada. The settlement required Shell Oil to pay for the re-installation of piping for millions of houses for claims filed through May 2009.

It is a remote, elongated, triangular coral atoll with profuse vegetation and a large central marine lagoon. Nikumaroro is about long by wide. The rim has two narrow entrances, both of which are blocked by a wide reef, which is dry at low tide. The ocean beyond the reef is very deep, and the only anchorage is at the island's west end, across the reef from the ruins of a mid-20th-century British colonial village, but this is safe only with the southeast trade winds. Landing has always been difficult and is most often done south of the anchorage. Although occupied at various times during the past, the island is uninhabited today. Kiribati declared the Phoenix Islands Protected Area in 2006, with the park being expanded in 2008. The 425,300-km2 (164,200-mi2) marine reserve contains eight coral atolls including Nikumaroro. Nikumaroro has been the focus of considerable speculation and exploration as a location where pilot Amelia Earhart might have crashed in July 1937 during her ill-fated final flight, which attempted to circumnavigate the globe. However, to date, no evidence of her plane has been found on or in the vicinity of the island. Geography Thick scrub and Pisonia forest cover the land surface. The trees grow in height and result in decomposing leaf material in the soil. Coconut palms remain from the attempts to operate a plantation on the island from 1893 to 1894 and later from 1938 to 1963. The scarcity of fresh water on Nikumaroro has proven problematic for residents in the past, and contributed directly to the failure of a British project to colonize the island from 1938 to 1963. Flora and fauna Western entrance to Nikumaroro's lagoon as seen from near the village ruins Large Pandanus sp. trees, viewed from underneath: Note the typical prop roots of the trees, enabling them to live along the coast, enduring violent seas and winds. They may have been planted as a food plant for the Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme, 1938‚Äì1962. Nikumaroro is sporadically visited by biologists attracted to its extensive marine and avian ecosystems. The atoll has populations of coconut crabs and migratory birds, and rats abound. Several species of sharks and bottlenose dolphins have been observed in the surrounding waters.\\"Niku IIII summary.\\" TIGHAR via tighar.org.

History=19th-century sightings and claims Nikumaroro was known by sundry names during the early 19th century: Kemins' Island, Kemis Island, Motu Oonga, Motu Oona, and Mary Letitia's Island. The first record of a European sighting was made by Capt. C. Kemiss (or Kemin, Kemish) from the British whaling ship Eliza Ann in 1824. On 19 August 1840, the USS Vincennes of the U.S. Exploring Expedition confirmed its position and recorded the atoll's name as Gardner Island, originally given in 1825 by Joshua Coffin of the Nantucket whaler Ganges. Some sources say the island was named after U.S. Congressman Gideon Gardner, who owned the Ganges.Bryan 1942, p. 71. In 1856, Nikumaroro was claimed as \\"Kemins Island\\" by CA Williams & Co. of New London, Connecticut, under the American Guano Islands Act. No record exists of guano deposits ever being exploited, however. On 28 May 1892, the island was claimed by the United Kingdom during a call by HMS Curacoa. Almost immediately, a license was granted to Pacific entrepreneur John T. Arundel for planting coconuts. Twenty-nine islanders were settled there and some structures with corrugated iron roofs were constructed, but a severe drought resulted in the failure of this project within a year. In 1916, it was leased to a Captain E.F.H. Allen of the Samoa Shipping Trading Co Ltd, but remained uninhabited until 1938. SS Norwich City wreck During a storm on 29 November 1929, the SS Norwich City, a large unladen British freighter with a crew of 35 men, ran aground on the reef at the island's northwest corner. A fire broke out in the engine room and all hands abandoned ship in darkness through storm waves across the dangerous coral reef. There were 11 fatalities. The survivors camped near collapsed structures from the abortive Arundel coconut plantation and were rescued after several days on the island. The devastated wreck of the Norwich City was a prominent landmark on the reef for 70 years, although by 2007, only the ship's keel, engine, and two large tanks remained.\\"'Norwich City' photograph and caption.\\" TIGHAR via tighar.org, 2007.

During the subsequent search for them and their plane, the United States Navy checked several nearby islands, including Gardner Island. A few months after their disappearance, a boat also visited Gardner Island, but found nothing. In 1938, recent skeletal remains were found on the island, but they were not linked to Earhart's flight. The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) made several expeditions to Nikumaroro during the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. The group investigated the renewed hypothesis that Earhart and Noonan had landed on Gardner Island after they had failed to find Howland Island. TIGHAR found and cataloged artifacts: U.S. beauty and skin- care products that may have dated to the 1930s, such as flakes of rouge and a shattered mirror from a woman's cosmetic compact,Lorenzi, Rossella. \\"Amelia Earhart's beauty case found?

The TIGHAR hypothesis has many critics, with TIGHAR's founder and executive director, Richard Gillespie, described as a good showman who lacks credible results.:\\"Indeed, Gillespie's search, the way in which his gifted showmanship has overshadowed the dubiousness of his discoveries and long odds of success, may be the most fitting tribute that the world could offer Earhart on the 75th anniversary of her death.\\" Zwick quoting Kurt Campbell: \\"He is by nature a showman and an explorer and an enthusiast.\\" A curator at the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum said: \\"Not to impugn [Gillespie], but I don't think he's found anything on any expedition.\\" To date, TIGHAR has failed to connect any of their artifacts to Earhart, Noonan, or to any specific person or persons known to have been on the island from 1929 to present. TIGHAR has failed to provide any dating to establish how long any of the artifacts were in the ground, nor has it provided evidence as to when the artifacts may have arrived on the island. Famed ocean explorer Robert Ballard led a 2019 expedition to locate Earhart's Lockheed Model 10-E Electra or evidence that it landed on Nikumaroro. After days of searching the deep cliffs supporting the island and the nearby ocean using state of the art equipment and technology, Ballard did not find any evidence of the plane or any associated wreckage of it. Allison Fundis, Ballard's chief operating officer stated: \\"We felt like if her plane was there, we would have found it pretty early in the expedition.\\" British settlement scheme Gardner and other islands of the Phoenix Group, from a geographical handbook compiled by the British Admiralty in 1943-45 On 1 December 1938, members of the British Pacific Islands Survey Expedition arrived to evaluate the island as a possible location for either seaplane landings or an airfield. On 20 December, more British officials arrived with 20 Gilbertese settlers in the last colonial expansion of the British Empire (other than formal annexations preparatory to withdrawal, etc.). The British colonial officer Gerald Gallagher established a headquarters of the Phoenix Islands Settlement Scheme in the village located on the island's western end, on the south side of the largest entrance to the lagoon. Efforts to clear land and plant coconuts were hindered by a profound lack of drinking water. By June 1939, a few wells had been successfully established and 58 I-Kiribati were on Gardner, comprising 16 men, 16 women, and 26 children. Wide coral-gravel streets and a parade ground were laid out and important structures included a thatched administration house, a wood- frame cooperative store, and a radio shack. Gallagher died and was buried on the island in 1941.\\"Archaeology and the fate of Amelia Earhart.\\" archaeology.about.com. Retrieved: 25 October 2009.

Its residents were evacuated to the Solomon Islands by the British, and by 1965, Gardner was officially uninhabited.

That same year, the United States, after having recently surveyed the island for possible weapons testing, relinquished any claims to Gardner through the Treaty of Tarawa. The island was officially renamed Nikumaroro, a name inspired by Gilbertese legends and used by the settlers during the 1940s and 1950s.

During Roman times it was called Cirta and was renamed \\"Constantina\\" in honor of emperor Constantine the Great. It was the capital of the French department of Constantine until 1962. Located somewhat inland, Constantine is about from the Mediterranean coast, on the banks of the Rhumel River. Constantine is regarded as the capital of eastern Algeria and the commercial center of its region, and it has a population of about 450,000 (938,475Office National des Statistiques, Recensement General de la Population et de l‚ÄôHabitat 2008 2008 population census.

Constantine is often referred to as the \\"City of Bridges\\" due to the numerous picturesque bridges connecting the various hills, valleys, and ravines that the city is built on and around. Constantine was named the Arab Capital of Culture in 2015.  History = Ancient history  General view, Constantine, 1899 The city was originally founded by the Phoenicians, who called it Sewa (royal city). Later it was renamed Cirta by the Numidian king Syphax, who turned it into his capital. The city was taken over by Numidia, the country of the Berber people, after the Carthaginians were defeated by Rome in the Third Punic War. In 112 B.C., the city was occupied by the Numidian king Jugurtha, who defeated his half-brother Adherbal. The city later served as the base for Roman generals Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus and Gaius Marius in their war against Jugurtha. Later, with the removal of King Juba I and the remaining supporters of Pompey in Africa (c. 46), Julius Caesar gave special rights to the citizens of Cirta, now known as Colonia Sittlanorum. In 311 AD, during the civil war between emperor Maxentius and usurper Domitius Alexander (a former governor of Africa), the city was destroyed. Rebuilt in 313 AD, it was subsequently named in Latin as \\"Colonia Constantiniana\\" or \\"Constantina\\",LOUIS, REN√â. ‚ÄúA LA RECHERCHE DE ‚ÄòCIRTA REGIA‚Äô CAPITALE DES ROIS NUMIDES.‚Äù Hommes Et Mondes, vol. 10, no. 39, 1949, pp. 276‚Äì287.

Captured by the Vandals in 432, Constantine returned to the Byzantine Exarchate of Africa (i.e. North Africa) from 534 to 697. It was conquered by the Arabs in the 8th century, receiving the name of Qacentina. During the 11th century, Banu Hilal, an Arab tribe living between Nile and Red Sea, settled in Tunisia, Tripolitania (western Libya) and Constantinois (eastern Algeria) which was Constantine party.  Modern history  The city recovered in the 12th century and under Almohad and Hafsid rule it was again a prosperous market, with links to Pisa, Genoa and Venice. After 1529 it was intermittently part of Ottoman Empire, ruled by a Turkish bey (governor) subordinate to the dey of Algiers. Salah Bey, who ruled the city in 1770‚Äì1792, greatly embellished it and built much of the Muslim architecture still visible today. Siege of Constantine in October 1837 In 1826 the last bey, Ahmed Bey ben Mohamed Ch√©rif, became the new head of state. He led a fierce resistance against French forces, which had invaded Algeria four years later. By 13 October 1837, the territory was captured by France, and from 1848 on until 1962 it was an integral part of the French motherland and centre of the Constantine D√©partement. In 1880, while working in the military hospital in Constantine, Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran discovered that the cause of malaria is a protozoan. He observed the parasites in a blood smear taken from a soldier who had just died of malaria. For this, he received the 1907 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. This was the first time that protozoa were shown to be a cause of disease. His work helped inspire researchers and veterinarians today to try to find a cure for malaria in animals. In 1934, Muslim anti-Jewish riots, the 1934 Constantine Pogrom, caused the death of 34 local Jews. During World War II, during the campaign in North Africa (1942‚Äì43), Allied forces used Constantine and the nearby cities of S√©tif and Bone as operational bases.  Geography  Constantine, canyon & bridges Constantine is situated on a plateau at an elevation above sea level. The city is framed by a deep ravine and has a dramatic appearance. The city is very picturesque with a number of bridges over Rhumel River and a viaduct crossing the ravine. The ravine is crossed by seven bridges, including Sidi M'Cid bridge. Constantine is the railhead of a prosperous and diverse agricultural area. It is also a centre of the grain trade and has flour mills, a tractor factory, and industries producing textiles, wool, linen and leather goods. Algeria and Tunisia serve as its markets.

In this season the Church celebrates the public ministry of Jesus from his baptism to the time of his final suffering and death. The word \\"ordinary\\" as used here comes from the ordinal numerals by which the weeks are identified or counted, from the 1st week of Ordinary Time in January to the 34th week that begins toward the end of November; Ordinary Time is interrupted by Lent and Eastertide.  Roman Rite  The Feast of the Baptism of the Lord, which ordinarily occurs on the Sunday after the Solemnity of the Epiphany of the Lord (6 January),The Feast of the Baptism of the Lord ordinarily occurs on the Sunday after the Solemnity of the Epiphany of the Lord (6 January) in places where the latter is a holy day of obligation; where it is not a holy day of obligation, it is celebrated on the Sunday after the Solemnity of Mary, Mother of God (1 January), and if this Sunday falls on 7 or 8 January, the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord is moved to the following day, the second Monday of the year. is the First Sunday in Ordinary Time. It closes the Season of Christmas and opens the Season of Ordinary Time. The weekdays that follow the Feast of the Baptism of the Lord are reckoned as belonging to the first week of Ordinary Time and the following Sunday as the Second Sunday of Ordinary Time. Ordinary Time continues until the Tuesday (varying between the 4th and 9th week of Ordinary Time) that immediately precedes Ash Wednesday. The date of the latter, which is on the 40th day (excluding Sundays) before Easter Sunday falls between 4 February and 10 March (inclusive). The date for Easter Sunday is determined by the Paschal full moon. Ordinary Time is then interrupted by Lent and Eastertide and resumes on the Monday after the Solemnity of Pentecost, the 50th day of Eastertide (10 May to 13 June). It concludes on the Saturday afternoon before the first Sunday of Advent (27 November to 3 December). The second period of Ordinary Time can thus sometimes last as much as seven months. The decision to treat the whole of Ordinary Time as a unit, calling it in Latin Tempus per annum (which literally means \\"the through-the-year season\\"), led to abandonment of the previous terminology, whereby the Sundays of the first period were called Sundays after Epiphany and those of the second period Sundays after Pentecost. The weeks, rather than the Sundays alone, are spoken of, in view of the assigning of specific Scripture readings at Mass not only to the Sundays of Ordinary Time but also to the weekdays. Taken thus as a unit, Ordinary Time is the longest season of the liturgical year, \\"Ordinary Time\\", Catholic Culture website. and is composed of 33 or 34 complete or partial weeks. In about 2 years out of 3, Ordinary Time comprises only 33 weeks,There are 34 weeks of Ordinary Time in years with dominical letters A or g or some combination containing A or g, i.e., Ag, bA, or gf. All other years have 33 weeks of Ordinary Time, with the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th or 10th week dropped from the calendar that year. so in those years one week is skipped when resuming Ordinary Time after Pentecost Sunday: for example, in 2011, the Sunday before Ash Wednesday was the 9th Sunday in Ordinary Time, but the day after Pentecost Sunday was Monday of the 11th Week of Ordinary Time. The liturgical color assigned to Ordinary Time Sundays and weekdays, is green.  Solemnities and feasts on Ordinary Time Sundays  The celebration of an Ordinary Time weekday gives way to that of any solemnity, feast, or obligatory memorial that falls on the same day, and may optionally be replaced by that of a non-obligatory memorial or of any saint mentioned in the Roman Martyrology for that day. The liturgy of a solemnity or a feast of the Lord that falls on an Ordinary Time Sunday during Ordinary Time replaces that of the Sunday. The solemnities and feasts of the Lord inscribed in the General Roman Calendar of the Catholic Church are:Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the General Roman Calendar: Table of liturgical days according to their order of precedence, p. 13 * Feast of the Presentation of the Lord on 2 February (liturgical color: white) * Solemnity of the Most Holy Trinity on the Sunday immediately after Pentecost (liturgical color: white) * Solemnity of the Body and Blood of Christ on Thursday or (if not a holyday of obligation) Sunday after Trinity Sunday (liturgical color: white) * Solemnity of the Sacred Heart of Jesus on Friday following the second Sunday after Pentecost (liturgical color: white) * Solemnity of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist on 24 June (liturgical color: white) * Solemnity of Saints Peter and Paul on 29 June (liturgical color: red) * Feast of the Transfiguration of the Lord on 6 August (liturgical color: white) * Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary on 15 August (liturgical color: white) * Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross on 14 September (liturgical color: red) * Solemnity of All Saints on 1 November (liturgical color: white) * Feast of the Dedication of the Basilica of Saint John Lateran in Rome on 9 November (liturgical color: white). * Solemnity of Our Lord Jesus Christ the King of the Universe falls on what would otherwise be the last Sunday in Ordinary Time The Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the General Roman Calendar also lists as solemnities (with precedence over Sundays in Ordinary Time) a number of celebrations whose dates vary from place to place and from one church to another even within the same parish: * The Solemnity of the principal patron of the place, city or state * The Solemnity of the dedication and the anniversary of the dedication of one's own church * The Solemnity of the Title of one's own church * The Solemnity either of the Title or of the Founder or of the principal Patron of an Order or Congregation. Christmas, Solemnity of the Epiphany of the Lord, and Feast of the Baptism of the Lord fall in Christmastide, not Ordinary Time. Likewise, the Solemnity of Pentecost is the last day of Eastertide. In addition, if a solemnity or feast that is \\"agreeable to the devotion of the faithful\\" occurs during the week, the Mass of that celebration may, for the pastoral good of the people, be used on a Sunday of Ordinary Time at all celebrations of Mass at which they are present, provided that it outranks Ordinary Time Sundays.Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, 58  Revised Common Lectionary usage  Following the lead of the liturgical reforms of the Roman Rite, many Protestant churches also adopted the concept of Ordinary Time alongside the Revised Common Lectionary, which applies the term \\"Ordinary Time\\" to the period between Pentecost and Advent. However, use of the term \\"Ordinary Time\\" is not common. Those that have adopted the Revised Common Lectionary include churches of the Anglican Communion, Methodist Churches, Lutheran Churches, Old Catholic Churches and Reformed Churches. Some Protestant denominations set off a time at the end of Ordinary Time known as Kingdomtide or Season of End Times. This period can range anywhere from only the three Sundays prior to Christ the King (as in the Wisconsin Synod Lutheran) to 13 or 14 weeks (most notably in the United Methodist Church). The Church of England observes this time between All Saints and Advent Sunday. In some traditions, what in the Roman Rite is the first period of Ordinary Time is called Epiphanytide (beginning on Epiphany Day in the Anglican Communion and Methodist churches) and from Trinity Sunday to Advent is called Trinitytide. In the Church of England, Sundays during \\"Ordinary Time\\" in this narrower sense are called \\"Sundays after Trinity\\", except the final four, which are termed \\"Sundays before Advent\\". In the Episcopal Church (United States), it is normal to refer to Sundays after Epiphany and Sundays after Pentecost (not Trinity). The total number of Sundays varies according to the date of Easter and can range anything from 18 to 23. When there are 23, the Collect and Post-Communion for the 22nd Sunday are taken from the provision for the Third Sunday before Lent.

It runs from State Route 1 near El Segundo and Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) to Interstate 605 in the City of Norwalk. Originally known as the Century Freeway, it was renamed the Glenn Anderson Freeway in 1994 for the Democratic California politician who advocated its construction. Route description The Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange with the Harbor Freeway (I-110). The California Streets and Highways Code defines Route 105 as \\"from Pershing Drive near El Segundo to Route 605,\\" but Caltrans never constructed the segment from Sepulveda Boulevard to Pershing Drive. Motorists can continue west via Imperial Highway over conventional roadway to Pershing Drive, but it is not part of Route 105 nor is it under state maintenance. I-105 begins at Sepulveda Boulevard (State Route 1) on the southern edge of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), adjacent to the city of El Segundo. It proceeds generally eastward from there on, crossing the Los Angeles and San Gabriel Rivers before terminating just east of the San Gabriel River Freeway (Interstate 605) in western Norwalk. The freeway stops short of intersecting with the Santa Ana Freeway (Interstate 5), its parent interstate. Instead, the primary lanes of I-105 terminate at an at-grade intersection with Studebaker Road. Much of the length of the Century Freeway runs parallel to Imperial Highway. It also runs parallel to (and a mile south of) Century Boulevard, from which its original name is derived. Century Boulevard, in turn, is named for its position equivalent to 100th Street in the Los Angeles grid. The Los Angeles Metro Rail C Line runs in the median of nearly the entire length of I-105. The Green Line's eastern terminus is at Norwalk, at the interchange between I-105 and I-605; two miles from the western end of the freeway, the Green Line separates onto its own right-of-way at Aviation Boulevard, splitting into two branches: one turning south towards Redondo Beach and one (currently under construction, scheduled to open in 2021) heading north towards near LAX and future people mover, which is scheduled to open in 2023. I-105 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. History Metro C Line platform at Willowbrook/Rosa Parks station, which lies between the east and westbound lanes of I-105. Early planning Interstate 105 was an integral part of a Caltrans 1960s master plan for the Southern California freeway system, but did not open until 1993. The right-of-way was included on several early highway plans since at least 1947, although it was not named the \\"Century Freeway\\" until 1956, and was numbered Route 42. In 1965, the Century Freeway was added to the state system originated at State Route 1 (Sepulveda Boulevard) east to Central Avenue in the City of Los Angeles along an alignment very near to the current right-of-way. The current route was added to the Interstate system in 1968. Design and local opposition The route was designed between 1968 and 1972 by Caltrans District 7, under the direction of Design Chief Sid Elicks. However, opposition from some of the communities through which the right-of-way would pass slowed the process and led to some reroutings. Many factors contributed to the delay. The growth of the environmental movement in the 1960s created resistance to new freeway construction. Fiscal difficulties brought about by the 1971 Sylmar earthquake and the California tax revolt of the late 1970s further hampered Caltrans' construction efforts. However, the major source of resistance to the freeway's construction was community opposition and the side effects of these demands. By the early 1970s, most of the areas in the freeway's path (and thus slated to be demolished) were predominantly African-American. Resentment over previous freeway projects' effects on other black communities resulted in significant modifications to the original route. Most cities along the way, weary of the noise and visual blight created by elevated freeways, demanded that the route be built far below grade in a \\"trench.\\" Also, another source for resistance to the freeway's construction was that much of the I-105 path was going to be built in low income, high crime neighborhoods, which also delayed the freeway's construction until the crime in the areas went down. Norwalk was opposed to the freeway's proposed route through its city center, and blocked the freeway from reaching its intended terminus at the Santa Ana Freeway; however, Caltrans had already decided to abandon that section due to the inability of the severely congested Santa Ana Freeway to accommodate any more traffic. Keith v. Volpe In 1972, community opposition resulted in a federal lawsuit, Keith v. Volpe, being filed, charging a violation of various civil rights protections and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). An important figure in the freeway's history was Harry Pregerson, a United States federal judge who presided over the lawsuit concerning the freeway's construction and chose to continue presiding over the case despite being promoted to a higher level court.Henry Weinstein, \\"A Concrete Accomplishment : Transit: Long-planned Interstate 105 opens with gala festivities. Amid the tumult, Judge Harry Pregerson takes pride in job-training and housing programs he helped ensure in the freeway corridor.\\" Los Angeles Times, October 15, 1993. The interchange with Interstate 110 is named the Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange in his honor. In 1972, Judge Pregerson enjoined the further development of the freeway until it has complied with the requirements of NEPA, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), the Federal-Aid Highway Act, and the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act of 1970. In 1979, this lawsuit resulted in a Consent Decree, amended in 1981, which imposed several conditions on development of the freeway, including additional public hearings, preparation of an environmental report, alterations to the design to reduce lanes and intersections, improve carpooling and provide for a transit way, which became the Los Angeles Metro Rail Green Line. A portion of the right-of-way was also to be constructed below grade to buffer adjacent areas from the effects of traffic noise. After construction began in the 1980s, failure to perform a full survey of the area's groundwater deposits, combined with the 20‚Äì30-foot below-grade trench through the city of Downey, resulted in buckling and cracking along the eastern portions of the route. At one point a large sinkhole opened in the Bellflower Boulevard on-ramp. This resulted in the construction of an elaborate pump system along the freeway between the interchanges with I-710 and I-605. Century Freeway Housing Program A significant aspect of the Keith v. Volpe Consent Decree was the requirement that the housing removed to construct the freeway be replaced, leading to the creation of the Century Freeway Housing Program within the California Department of Housing and Community Development. =Notable demolished homes and buildings= The childhood home of Brian, Carl and Dennis Wilson of The Beach Boys was demolished in the mid-1980s to make way for the freeway, as was the house across the street where their bandmate David Marks grew up. In 2005, the Beach Boys Historic Landmark was built on the former site of the Wilson brothers' home and declared a California Historic Landmark. The birthplace of Metallica, former bassist Ron McGovney's house, stood directly in the path of the route nearby to the 605 in Downey. Another home in Downey, California, where siblings Richard and Karen Carpenter grew up before forming the musical duo The Carpenters, was also razed for the 105. Post-construction Westbound view along Interstate 105 heading towards Vermont Ave, through the Interstate 110 interchange Throughout the difficulties, Congressman Glenn M. Anderson (D-San Pedro) tirelessly advocated for the route's construction, touting its possibilities for congestion relief along Century, Manchester, and Firestone Boulevards and the Imperial Highway; it succeeded in these tasks, as well as relieving pressure on the Santa Monica (I-10) and San Diego (I-405) Freeways for travelers between Downtown Los Angeles and LAX. After Anderson's death in 1994, Caltrans honored him by renaming the freeway in his honor. However, the route's original name, \\"Century Freeway\\", is still used on a number of maps. The freeway was originally signed with El Segundo as its westbound control city; however, in recent years, many of the El Segundo signs have been replaced and/or covered with \\"LAX Airport\\" signage due to the western terminus' proximity to Los Angeles International Airport. Shortly before opening, filmmakers had access to use the empty freeway for a number of weeks to film the 1994 motion picture Speed. Interstate 105 (1964‚Äì68) Previously, the I-105 designation was used for U.S. Route 101 (the Santa Ana Freeway) from I-5 (the Golden State Freeway) at the East Los Angeles Interchange to the connection to I-10 (the San Bernardino Freeway; this connection had been I-110); it went back to U.S. 101 in 1968. Exit listIn popular culture * The Judge Harry Pregerson Interchange with I-110 was used in the 2016 musical film La La Land * Scenes for the 1994 film Speed were filmed on the freeway before it opened. The freeway was used for both a stand- in for Interstate 10 and as the still-unopened 105 freeway. * The song \\"Rollin' with My Homies,\\" by the rapper Coolio. * In the 2013 video game Grand Theft Auto V, set in the fictional city of Los Santos (based on the Los Angeles metropolitan area), the 105 is represented as the Olympic Freeway. * in the 2007 film Live Free or Die Hard, the climactic scene where the protagonist John McClane is being chased by a fighter jet was filmed on the 105 freeway. * The transition of the 105 freeway with the 405 freeway included two notable changes. The L-shaped building at the northwest corner of La Cienega Blvd and Imperial Highway lost its L-leg to make way for the 405 south to 105 west transition ramp. Just under 1/2 of its square footage was lost to the demolition. * To make way for the tunneling of the 105 eastbound transition to the 405 northbound -and- the 105 westbound transition to the 405 southbound, which included a complete demolition of almost 90 feet' of the 405, the entire 405 freeway was shifted about 300' east via a temporary freeway bridge. This bypass took about 5-7 months to complete, the 405 was rebuilt with the new tunneling underneath, and the bypass bridge was demolished to make way for the continuance of the eastern side of the 105. * On the eastern terminus, the new 105 had a severe flooding problem, even in relatively short rainy periods. Over an almost 3/4-year span the freeway was selectively closed and bypassed to allow for a better drainage scheme, hiking the cost of the entire freeway by a couple of hundred million. It worked and the freeway has not flooded since.

Photo by Dmitri Smirnov. Edison Vasilievich Denisov (, 6 April 1929 ‚Äì 24 November 1996) was a Russian composer in the so-called \\"Underground\\", \\"alternative\\" or \\"nonconformist\\" division of Soviet music. Biography The house in Tomsk where Denisov was born; the memorial plaque is visible. Denisov was born in Tomsk, Siberia, into the family of a radio physicist, who gave him the very unusual first name Edison, in honour of Thomas Edison. He studied mathematics before deciding to spend his life composing. This decision was enthusiastically supported by Dmitri Shostakovich, who gave him lessons in composition. In 1951‚Äì56 Denisov studied at the Moscow Conservatory: composition with Vissarion Shebalin, orchestration with Nikolay Rakov, analysis with Viktor Tsukkerman and piano with Vladimir Belov. In 1956‚Äì59 he composed the opera Ivan-Soldat (Soldier Ivan) in three acts based on Russian folk fairy tales. He began his own study of scores that were difficult to obtain in the USSR at that time, including music by composers ranging from Mahler and Debussy to Boulez and Stockhausen. He wrote a series of articles giving a detailed analysis of different aspects of contemporary compositional techniques and at same time actively experimented as a composer, trying to find his own way. After graduating from the Moscow Conservatory, he taught orchestration and later composition there. His pupils included the composers Dmitri Smirnov, Elena Firsova, Vladimir Tarnopolsky, Sergey Pavlenko, Ivan Sokolov, Yuri Kasparov, Dmitri Kapyrin, and Aleksandr Shchetinskiy. In 1979, at the Sixth Congress of the Union of Soviet Composers, he was blacklisted as one of \\"Khrennikov's Seven\\" for unapproved participation in a number of festivals of Soviet music in the West. Denisov became a leader of the Association for Contemporary Music reestablished in Moscow in 1990. Later he moved to France, where after an accident and long illness he died in a Paris hospital in 1996. Music Denisov's cycle for soprano and chamber ensemble Le soleil des Incas (1964), setting poems by Gabriela Mistral and dedicated to Pierre Boulez, brought him international recognition following a series of successful performances of the work in Darmstadt and Paris (1965). Igor Stravinsky liked the piece, discovering the \\"remarkable talent\\" of its composer. However, it was harshly criticised by the Union of Soviet Composers for its \\"western influences\\", \\"erudition instead of creativity\\", and \\"total composer's arbitrary\\" (Tikhon Khrennikov). After that, performances of his works were frequently banned in the Soviet Union. Later he wrote a flute concerto for Aur√®le Nicolet, a violin concerto for Gidon Kremer, works for the oboist Heinz Holliger, clarinettist Eduard Brunner and a sonata for alto saxophone and piano for Jean-Marie Londeix, that became highly popular among saxophone players. His sombre but striking Requiem, setting a multi-lingual text (English, French, German, and Latin) based on works by the German writer Francisco Tanzer, was given its first performance in Hamburg in 1980. Among his major works are the operas L'√©cume des jours after Boris Vian (1981), Quatre Filles after Pablo Picasso (1986) and ballet Confession after Alfred de Musset.

On October 26, 2004, AT&T; Wireless was acquired by Cingular Wireless, a joint venture of SBC Communications and BellSouth, to form the largest wireless carrier in the United States at the time. On November 16, 2004, AT&T; Wireless stores were rechristened under the Cingular banner. The legal entity \\"AT&T; Wireless Services, Inc.\\" was renamed \\"New Cingular Wireless Services, Inc.\\"PA Bulletin Doc. No. 06-1740 In late 2005, SBC (the majority partner in Cingular) acquired the original AT&T;, and rebranded as \\"the new AT&T;\\". Cingular became wholly owned by the new AT&T; in December 2006 as a result of the new AT&T;'s acquisition of BellSouth. After the merger, Cingular was renamed AT&T; Mobility in late 2006 and remained the largest wireless carrier until 2009 when Verizon Wireless acquired Alltel to become the largest wireless service provider by a number of subscribers. History=McCaw Cellular McCaw Cellular logo AT&T; Wireless began in 1987 as McCaw Cellular Communications, a cellular telephone pioneer in the United States. Savvy licensing of cellular spectrum in the early 1980s put McCaw Cellular in an extremely strong position, quickly outpacing the growth of the \\"Baby Bells\\" in the emerging market. The company purchased MCI Communications's mobile businesses in 1986, followed by LIN Broadcasting in 1989, giving them widespread access in all of the major US markets. Partnering with AT&T; as a technology provider, McCaw introduced their \\"Cellular One\\" service in 1990, the first truly national cellular system. AT&T; purchased 33% of the company in 1992 and arranged a merger in 1994 that made Craig McCaw one of AT&T;'s largest shareholders. In 2002, the company was spun off from AT&T; to become AT&T; Wireless Services. In 1966 J. Elroy McCaw sold one of his cable television holdings in Centralia, Washington to his three sons, including Craig who was 16 years old at the time. Craig took an increasingly central role in the development of McCaw Communications, and by the early 1980s had grown the company from 2,000 subscribers to about $5 million in annual revenue.AT&T; Wireless In 1981 McCaw came across an AT&T; document about the future of cellular telephony, which predicted that by the start of the 21st century there would be 900,000 cellular subscribers in the United States. Intrigued, McCaw found that the licenses for cellular spectrum were being sold at $4.50 per \\"pop\\", meaning he could build a base for future subscribers for very low cost. By 1983, McCaw Communications had purchased licenses in six of the 30 largest US markets. McCaw then succeeded in using the licenses and collateral, based on the AT&T; projections, using that collateral to take out loans and buy more licenses, and eventually buying billions of dollars of spectrum. In 1987 he sold the cable business for $755 million and used this new capital to buy even more cellular licenses. It was around this time that the first wave of analog cellular telephones were starting to enter the consumer consciousness. The Baby Bells started the process of buying their own licenses, only to find that McCaw owned enough of most of the major markets to lock them out unless they purchased spare licenses from him, at a huge profit. His network of licenses in the major markets was used as a lever to buy, sell or trade licenses in other markets that were not considered profitable, at a considerable discount. In 1986 the company purchased MCI's wireless operations, cellular and paging, for $122 million, and changed their name to \\"McCaw Cellular Communications\\".Biography In 1989 the company outbid BellSouth for control of LIN Broadcasting, which owned licenses in Houston, Dallas, Los Angeles, and New York, paying $3.5 billion, a price that represented $350 per license. Cellular One At this point McCaw's focus turned from dealing licenses to servicing the network, signing up customers in what was now a maturing technology on the cusp of explosive growth. In order to handle the customer side of the business, McCaw turned to AT&T; for technology. In 1990, McCaw Cellular introduced SS7 signaling across their network. Prior to this, each cell tower in the network connected to local signaling, billing, and sets of land-lines. Since only the towers in the area local to the customer's home had access to dialing and routing information, when they traveled to another area calls could not reach them. With the introduction of SS7 signaling, the dialing and routing information could now be switched across the entire network (known technically as Non-Facility Associated Signalling), tying it together into a single national network. They called the new system \\"Cellular One\\", and introduced the concept of roaming charges. That year, McCaw earned $54 million, making him America's highest-paid chief executive. The partnership grew in November 1992, when AT&T; purchased 1/3 of the company for $3.8 billion. At the time, the company was generating $1.75 billion in annual revenue, and had two million Cellular One subscribers - far more customers than AT&T;'s earlier projections for all cellular use in the US, at a point almost ten years earlier. Purchase by AT&T; Corp. In 1994 the merger of the two companies was completed when AT&T; purchased the rest of McCaw Cellular for $11.5 billion, at that time the second largest merger in US history, second only to the RJR Nabisco takeover documented in Barbarians at the Gate. The merger was completed in late 1994, creating AT&T; Wireless Group, which was at that time the largest cellular carrier in the US. AT&T; kick-started their cellular division with 2 million subscribers. As a result of the merger, Craig McCaw became one of AT&T;'s largest shareholders, but he refused to sit on the Board of Directors because he couldn't stand long meetings. McCaw left daily operations to focus on Teledesic, passing control of AT&T; Wireless to James Barksdale, and then Steve Hooper when Barksdale left for Netscape. Hooper, a long time McCaw Cellular executive, was tapped by AT&T; to be the CEO of the newly acquired division. Under his direction, AT&T; Wireless grew to be the nation's largest cellular provider by the end of 1997, at which point Hooper and many of the remaining McCaw era executives departed. By 1999 and 2000 the cellular industry began to consolidate and Verizon Wireless and Cingular Wireless became the first and second-largest national carriers. The year 1999 also brought John D. Zeglis as chief executive in October, followed a few months later by Dan Hesse's departure, who had been head of the division since 1997. Over the next year and a half, all six McCaw regional presidents left the declining company. Spinoff In April 2000, AT&T; Wireless became a separately traded entity with the world's largest initial public offering at that time. Just over a year later in July 2001, AT&T; Wireless became a separate company rather than a division of AT&T; Corp. In 2003, AT&T; Wireless was granted several mobile licenses for Caribbean countries including Barbados, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. AT&T; Wireless's decline climaxed in 2003 with the FCC mandating the allowance of porting numbers to other carriers. AT&T; Wireless experienced a mass exodus of many customers who were fed up with years of degrading service and poor coverage. By the end of 2003, AT&T; Wireless faced a public relations nightmare when a new system for adding subscribers and porting numbers in/out was implemented and botched. Realizing that it faced an impossible situation, AT&T; Wireless Services, Inc began accepting bids in early 2004 to be acquired. As of January 1, 2004, the largest single shareholder of AT&T; Wireless was Japan's NTT DoCoMo, which was one of the first to place a bid to buy the company. In the middle of 2004 much of the Caribbean operations and Bermuda were agreed to be sold to Digicel Group. Acquisition by Cingular On February 13, 2004, AT&T; Wireless accepted bids for the acquisition of the wireless company. The two top bidders were British carrier Vodafone and American competitor Cingular. Cingular was owned by two Baby Bells; 40% by BellSouth and 60% by SBC Communications. Vodafone owned 45% of Verizon Wireless and had it succeeded in the bid, their share of Verizon Wireless would then have been sold to parent company Verizon Communications. Cingular emerged victorious February 17 by agreeing to pay more than $41 billion, more than twice the company's recent trading value, to acquire AT&T; Wireless. Some analysts have said that although Vodafone, the world's largest mobile operator, was unsuccessful in acquiring the company, it was nonetheless successful in forcing a competitor to overpay for the acquisition of AT&T; Wireless. The sale received US government approval and closed on October 26. Companies that originally comprised Cingular from its inception, such as BellSouth Mobility, were absorbed into the AT&T; Wireless Services corporate structure. The AT&T; Wireless brand was retired by Cingular on April 26, 2005, six months after the close of the merger. This was per a pre-spinoff agreement with AT&T; Corp. that stated that if AT&T; Wireless was to be bought by a competitor, the rights to the name AT&T; Wireless and the use of the AT&T; name in wireless phone service would revert to AT&T; Corp. AT&T; Wireless's prepaid services, Go Phone, was adopted by Cingular Wireless after the merger closed, and is still in use today by the current AT&T; Mobility. Partnerships Rogers AT&T; Wireless was a publicly traded partnership between Rogers and AT&T.; It operated a mobile network in Canada until Rogers bought out AT&T;'s stake in 2004 and took the company private. See Rogers Wireless. SunCom Wireless was a brand name used by three separate companies: Telecorp PCS, Tritel PCS, and Triton PCS (based in Arlington, VA, Jackson, MS, and Berwyn, PA, respectively). All three used the same SunCom logo, but operated as completely independent companies, though all were affiliates of AT&T; Wireless, which owned 23% of each company. Telecorp operated primarily in Wisconsin, Iowa, Louisiana, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Puerto Rico. Tritel operated primarily in Mississippi, Kentucky, Alabama, and Tennessee. Triton operated primarily in North and South Carolina and Virginia. In 2002, Telecorp and Tritel completed a merger, while Triton remained independent. In 2003, AT&T; Wireless acquired Telecorp/Tritel and closed the Telecorp headquarters in Arlington, VA. Cincinnati Bell Wireless started as a joint venture between Cincinnati Bell and AT&T; Wireless, in which AT&T; Wireless owned 20%. When AT&T; Wireless was purchased by Cingular, control of the 20% passed to Cingular as well. On February 17, 2006, Cincinnati Bell took full control of Cincinnati Bell Wireless by purchasing Cingular's 20% ownership for $80 million. AT&T; brand returns to wireless The AT&T; brand in wireless ended in 2004, but it would be brought back a few years later. On November 18, 2005, SBC Communications completed a merger with AT&T; Corp., and took on the name AT&T; and created a new modern globe logo. After the merger, rumors surfaced of a revival of AT&T;'s brand in wireless via a rebranding of Cingular; however, Cingular, Bellsouth, and the new AT&T; maintained that the Cingular brand would remain for the time being. Then, the new AT&T; announced on March 5, 2006, that it would be acquiring BellSouth's telephone operations and its stake in Cingular Wireless. On December 29, 2006, the FCC gave its final approval to the AT&T; and BellSouth merger. With both parent companies merged into one, Cingular Wireless officially became AT&T; Mobility in 2007. The rebranding phase was a gradual process but by mid-2007, the Cingular Wireless brand (not the company) was officially discontinued for the AT&T; name. Thus, AT&T; as a wireless brand is alive and well; however, the old AT&T; Wireless Services company remains defunct. Today, AT&T; stores sell all AT&T; products and services: Wireless, Landline, Internet, U-Verse, DIRECTV, and more.

He is one of the so-called \\"The Four Greats\\" of Norwegian literature, along with Henrik Ibsen, Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson and Jonas Lie. Background Born in Stavanger, Norway, he grew up in a rich merchant family. He was the son of consul Jens Zetlitz Kielland and great-grandson of Gabriel Schanche Kielland (1760‚Äì1821). Kielland was the younger brother of Norwegian landscape painter Kitty Lange Kielland.Alexander Lange Kielland (Ancestry.com) His family also included his son, Jens Zetlitz Kielland, (1873‚Äì1926); uncle Jacob Otto Lange (1833‚Äì1902), cousin Axel Christian Zetlitz Kielland (1853‚Äì1924), nephew Jens Zetlitz Monrad Kielland (1866‚Äì1926), cousin Anders Lange (1904‚Äì1974) and great nephew Jacob Christie Kielland (1897‚Äì1972). His great niece Axeliane Christiane Zetlitz Kielland (1916‚Äì1995) married Agnar Mykle (1915‚Äì1994). Career Despite being born wealthy, he had a sincere affection for the less fortunate, treating his workers well when he was a factory owner. He remained a spokesman for the weak and a critic of society throughout his time as a writer. His best known plays were the satirical comedies Tre Par (1886) and Professoren (1888). He was also well known for his short stories.Alexander L. Kielland, utdypning (Store norske leksikon) Among his most famous works are the novels Gift (1883), Skipper Worse (1882) and Garman & Worse (1880). Gift (published in English as Poison ) is the first of a trilogy including Fortuna (1884) and St. Hans Fest (1887). In this trilogy, Kielland satirizes the hypocrisy of Norway's clergy. In Gift, Kielland debates the preference for Latin that Norwegian teachers had during his time. The story features a young boy called Marius, lying on his deathbed while repeating Latin grammar.Alexander L. Kielland-ulykken (Store norske leksikon) From 1889 to 1890, Kielland worked as a journalist for the newspaper Stavanger Avis. Kielland virtually stopped writing fiction in 1891 and published only stories which had been published earlier. In 1891 he was designated the mayor of his hometown, Stavanger, until 1902 when he relocated to Molde as county governor of the land M√∏re og Romsdal.Alexander Lange Kielland (Edvard Beyer / Morten Moi. Store norske leksikon) It has been debated why Kielland ended his career as a writer so early. Some believe that he was so much of a realist that he could not deal with the neo-romantic tendencies of Norwegian literature at the end of the 19th century. A more probable reason is that he chose to focus on his political career. The biography of Alexander L. Kielland by Tor Obrestad includes thoughts about Kielland dying from obesity. Already from the mid-1880s, Kielland had suffered from shortness of breath. He had several heart attacks, constantly gained weight, and couldn't control his great passion for food.

Maclay, along with Robert Morris, was a member of Pennsylvania's first two-member delegation to the United States Senate. Following his tenure in the Senate, he served in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives on two separate occasions, as a county judge, and as a presidential elector. Biography Maclay pursued classical studies and then served as a lieutenant in an expedition to Fort Duquesne in 1758. He went on to serve in other expeditions in the French and Indian Wars. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1760. After a period of practising law, he became a surveyor in the employ of the Penn family, and then a prothonotary and clerk of the courts of Northumberland County in the 1770s. During the American Revolution, he served in the Continental Army as a commissary. He was also a frequent member of the state legislature in the 1780s. During that period, he was also the Indian commissioner, a judge of the court of common pleas, and a member of the executive council. After the ratification of the Constitution Maclay was elected to the United States Senate and served from March 4, 1789 to March 4, 1791. He received a two-year term instead of the usual six-year term for senators after he lost a lottery with the other Pennsylvania senator, Robert Morris. In the Senate, Maclay was one of the most radical members of the Anti-Administration faction. In his journal, which is the only diary and one of the most important records of the First United States Congress, he criticizes John Adams and George Washington. He also criticized many of their supporters who ran the senate and included particularly senators, believing that their ways of running the Senate were inefficient. He was unsuccessful in his attempt to be re-elected by the state legislature of Pennsylvania. Maclay retired to his farm in Dauphin, Pennsylvania, but he was also a member of the Pennsylvania State House of Representatives in 1795, 1796, and 1797. In addition, he was a presidential elector in 1796, a county judge from 1801 to 1803, and a member again of the state House of Representatives in 1803. He was married to the daughter of John Harris, Sr., of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He died in 1804 and was interred in Old Paxtang Church Cemetery in Harrisburg. Several of his relatives were also politicians, including his brother, Samuel Maclay, and his nephew, William Plunkett Maclay.

Pulcher was blockading the Carthaginian stronghold of Lilybaeum (modern Marsala) when he decided to attack their fleet, which was in the harbour of the nearby city of Drepana. The Roman fleet sailed by night to carry out a surprise attack but became scattered in the dark. Adherbal was able to lead his fleet out to sea before it was trapped in harbour; having gained sea room in which to manoeuvre he then counter-attacked. The Romans were pinned against the shore, and after a day of fighting were heavily defeated by the more manoeuvrable Carthaginian ships with their better-trained crews. It was Carthage's greatest naval victory of the war; they turned to the maritime offensive after Drepana and all but swept the Romans from the sea. It was seven years before Rome again attempted to field a substantial fleet, while Carthage put most of its ships into reserve to save money and free up manpower. Sources The main source for almost every aspect of the First Punic War is the historian Polybius ( ‚Äì 118 BC), a Greek sent to Rome in 167 BC as a hostage. His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics, but he is known today for The Histories, written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the Battle of Drepana. Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view. Carthaginian written records were destroyed along with their capital, Carthage, in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, Greek and Latin sources. Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about. Only the first book of the 40 comprising The Histories deals with the First Punic War. The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account. The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \\"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\\"; while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \\"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\\". Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form, and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea. Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of Diodorus Siculus and Dio Cassius, although the classicist Adrian Goldsworthy states that \\"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\\". Other sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the trireme Olympias. Since 2010 a number of artefacts have been recovered from the nearby site of the Battle of the Aegates, the final battle of the war, fought eight years later. Their analysis and the recovery of further items are ongoing. Background=Operations in Sicily In 264 BC the states of Carthage and Rome went to war, starting the First Punic War. Carthage was a well-established maritime power in the western Mediterranean; Rome had recently unified mainland Italy south of the River Arno under its control. Rome's expansion into southern Italy probably made it inevitable that it would eventually clash with Carthage over Sicily on some pretext. The immediate cause of the war was the issue of control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern Messina). By 241 BC the war had lasted 15 years, with many changes of fortune. It had developed into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to defeat the Carthaginians decisively and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily. The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty. In 260 BC the Romans built a large fleet and over the following ten years defeated the Carthaginians in a succession of naval battles. The Romans also slowly gained control of most of Sicily, including the major cities of Akragas (modern Agrigento; Agrigentum in Latin; captured in 262 BC) and Panormus (modern Palermo; captured in 254 BC). Ships During this war the standard warship was the quinquereme, meaning \\"five-oared\\". The quinquereme was a galley, long, wide at water level, with its deck standing above the sea, and displacing around 100 long tons (110 short tons; 100 tonnes). The galley expert John Coates suggests they could maintain 7 knots (8 mph; 13 km/h) for extended periods. The modern replica galley Olympias has achieved speeds of 8.5 knots (10 mph; 16 km/h) and cruised at for hours on end. Vessels were built as cataphract, or \\"protected\\", shipsthat is, fully decked overso as to be better able to carry marines and catapults. They had a separate \\"oar box\\" attached to the main hull which contained the rowers. These features allowed the hull to be strengthened, increased carrying capacity and improved conditions for the rowers. The generally accepted theory regarding the arrangement of oarsmen in quinqueremes is that there would be sets ‚Äì or files ‚Äì of three oars, one above the other, with two oarsmen on each of the two uppermost oars and one on the lower, for a total of five oarsmen per file. This would be repeated down the side of a galley for a total of 28 files on each side; 168 oars in total. In 260 BC the Romans set out to construct a fleet and used a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own. As novice shipwrights, the Romans built copies that were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, which made them slower and less manoeuvrable. The quinquereme was the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout the Punic Wars, although hexaremes (six oarsmen per bank), quadriremes (four oarsmen per bank) and triremes (three oarsmen per bank) are also occasionally mentioned. So ubiquitous was the type that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for \\"warship\\" in general. A quinquereme carried a crew of 300, of which 280 were oarsmen and 20 deck crew and officers; it would normally also carry a complement of 40 marines, and if battle was thought to be imminent, this would be increased to as many as 120. Getting the oarsmen to row as a unit, as well as execute more complex battle manoeuvres, required long and arduous training. At least half of the oarsmen would need to have had some experience if the ship was to be handled effectively. As a result, the Romans were initially at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. To counter Carthaginian superiority, the Romans introduced the corvus, a bridge wide and long, with a heavy spike on the underside, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship's deck. This allowed Roman legionaries acting as marines to board enemy ships and capture them, rather than employing the previously traditional tactic of ramming. All warships were equipped with a ram, a triple set of bronze blades weighing up to positioned at the waterline. They were made individually by the lost-wax method to fit immovably to a galley's prow and secured with bronze spikes. In the century prior to the Punic Wars, boarding had become increasingly common and ramming had declined, as the larger and heavier vessels adopted in this period lacked the speed and manoeuvrability necessary to ram, while their sturdier construction reduced the ram's effect even in the case of a successful attack. The Roman adaptation of the was a continuation of this trend and compensated for their initial disadvantage in ship manoeuvring skills. The added weight in the prow compromised the ship's manoeuvrability, and in rough sea conditions the became useless. In 255 BC the Roman fleet was devastated by a storm while returning from Africa, with 384 ships sunk from a total of 464 and 100,000 men lost. It is possible that the presence of the made the Roman ships unusually unseaworthy and there is no record of them being used after this disaster. Prelude Largely because of the Romans' use of the , the Carthaginians were defeated in large naval battles at Mylae (260 BC), Sulci (257 BC), Ecnomus (256 BC) and Cape Hermaeum (255 BC). During 252 and 251 BC the Roman army avoided battle, according to Polybius because they feared the war elephants which the Carthaginians had shipped to Sicily. In 250 BC the Carthaginians attempted to recapture Panormus, but were defeated, losing most of their elephants. Contemporary accounts do not report either side's other losses, and modern historians consider later claims of 20,000‚Äì30,000 Carthaginian casualties improbable. Encouraged by their victory at Panormus, the Romans moved against Lilybaeumwhich was the main Carthaginian base on Sicily. A large army commanded by the year's consuls Publius Claudius Pulcher and Lucius Junius Pullus besieged the city. They had rebuilt their fleet, and 200 ships blockaded the harbour. Early in the blockade, 50 Carthaginian quinqueremes gathered off the Aegates Islands, which lie to the west of Sicily. Once there was a strong west wind, they sailed into Lilybaeum before the Romans could react. They unloaded reinforcementseither 10,000 or 4,000 according to different ancient sourcesand a large quantity of supplies. They evaded the Romans by leaving at night, evacuating the Carthaginian cavalry. alt=A map of Sicily showing the small amount of territory controlled by Carthage The Romans sealed off the landward approach to Lilybaeum with earth and timber camps and walls. They made repeated attempts to block the harbour entrance with a heavy timber boom, but due to the prevailing sea conditions they were unsuccessful. The Carthaginian garrison was kept supplied by blockade runners. These were light and manoeuvrable quinqueremes with highly trained crews and pilots who knew the shoals and currents of the difficult waters. Chief among the blockade runners was a galley captained by Hannibal the Rhodian, who taunted the Romans with the superiority of his vessel and crew. Eventually, the Romans captured Hannibal and his well-constructed galley. In 250 BC an additional 10,000 oarsmen were allocated to the Roman fleet. Pulcher, the senior consul, supported by a council of war, believed these gave him sufficient advantage to risk an attack on the Carthaginian fleet at Drepana, north of Lilybaeum along the west coast of Sicily. The Roman fleet sailed on a moonless night to avoid detection and ensure surprise. The Romans had a tradition of divining the likely fortune of a military endeavour by observing the actions of the sacred chickens. In the early morning they would be offered food: if they ate eagerly, the omens were good; if they refused it, the action was ill-fated. When the solemn ceremony was performed on the way to Drepana, the chickens declined to eat. Infuriated, Pulcher pitched them overboard, exclaiming that if they were not hungry, then perhaps they were thirsty. Polybius does not mention this, which has caused some modern historians to doubt its veracity. T. P. Wiseman even thought that the whole episode was an invention from a hostile annalist to harm the reputation of the Claudii.  Battle  By dawn the Romans were close to Drepana but were experiencing problems. In the dark it had proved difficult to keep station. This was exacerbated by the recent incorporation of the 10,000 new oarsmen, who were not trained nor experienced at working with the existing crews. As a result, morning found the Roman ships spread out in a long, disorganised line. Pulcher's ship was towards the rear, possibly so he could discourage straggling. The Carthaginian commander, Adherbal, was taken completely by surprise when his lookouts reported the approach of the Romans. However, his ships were ready for sea, and he immediately ordered them to take on board the garrison as marines, and to follow him out to sea. The Roman fleet consisted of more than 120 ships; some sources give as many as 200. The Carthaginians had between 100 and 130 vessels. All of the warships, on both sides, were carrying full complements of marines. The more advanced of the Roman ships had reached the mouth of the harbour and were in a position to attempt to block it. However, Pulcher, seeing that surprise was lost, ordered them to fall back and concentrate in battle formation. This order took some time to transmit and resulted in some ships responding to it and turning into the paths of others still pressing forward and fouling them. So poor was the Roman seamanship that several ships collided, or sheared the oars off friendly vessels. Meanwhile, Adherbal led his fleet past the confused Roman vanguard and continued west, passing between the city and two small islands to reach the open sea. Here they had room to manoeuvre and headed south, forming a line of battle that was parallel to the Romans. The Carthaginians managed to get five ships south of Pulcher's flagship, echeloned towards the shore, and so cut off the entire Roman fleet from its line of retreat to Lilybaeum. The Romans, meanwhile, had formed up in a line facing west, with the shore behind them, which prevented them from being outflanked. The Carthaginians attacked, and the weakness of Pulcher's dispositions became apparent. The Carthaginian ships were lighter built and more manoeuvrable, and their crews were more experienced and accustomed to working together. The Romans lacked the to even the fight. On the other hand, the Carthaginians were probably outnumbered. The Carthaginians had the additional advantage that if an individual ship was getting the worse of a melee, it could reverse oars and withdraw; if the Roman vessel followed up, it left both of its flanks vulnerable. The Romans, with the shore close behind them, had no such advantage, and they attempted to stay in a tight formation for mutual protection. The battle was hard-fought and ground on through the day. The quality of the legionaries serving as the Roman marines, and their tight formation, made boarding difficult. But the Carthaginians handily outmanoeuvred the Romans, picking off exposed ships to ram, and steadily gaining more and more of an advantage. Eventually Roman discipline cracked; several ships were intentionally run aground so their crews could flee, and Pulcher led a successful breakout by 30 Roman ships, the only ones to survive the battle. The result was an utter Roman defeat, with 93 of their ships captured, an unknown number sunk, and 20,000 men killed or captured. It was Carthage's greatest naval victory of the war. Aftermath Shortly after the battle, Adherbal was reinforced by Carthalo with 70 ships. Adherbal brought Carthalo's command up to 100 and sent him to raid Lilybaeum, where he burnt several Roman ships. A little later, he harried a Roman supply convoy of 800 transports, escorted by 120 warships, to such good effect that it was caught by a storm which sank all the vessels except for two. The Carthaginians further exploited their victory by raiding, ineffectively, the coasts of Roman Italy in 248 BC. The absence of Roman fleets then led Carthage to gradually decommission her navy, reducing the financial strain of building, maintaining and repairing ships, and providing and provisioning their crews. They withdrew most of their warships from Sicily, and the war there entered a period of stalemate. It was seven years after Drepana before Rome attempted to build another substantial fleet. Pulcher was recalled and charged with treason. He was convicted of a lesser chargesacrilege over the chicken incidentnarrowly escaped a death sentence and was exiled. Pulcher's sister, Claudia, became infamous when, obstructed in a street blocked by poorer citizens, she wished aloud that her brother would lose another battle so as to thin the crowd. The war eventually ended in 241 BC after the Battle of the Aegates, with a Roman victory and an agreed peace. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. The Romans had built over 1,000 galleys during the war; and this experience of building, manning, training, supplying and maintaining such numbers of ships laid the foundation for Rome's maritime dominance for 600 years.

It took place among the Aegates Islands, off the western coast of the island of Sicily. The Carthaginians were commanded by Hanno, and the Romans were under the overall authority of Gaius Lutatius Catulus, but Quintus Valerius Falto commanded during the battle. It was the final and deciding battle of the 23-year-long First Punic War. The Roman army had been blockading the Carthaginians in their last strongholds on the west coast of Sicily for several years. Almost bankrupt, the Romans borrowed money to build a naval fleet, which they used to extend the blockade to the sea. The Carthaginians assembled a larger fleet which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It would then embark much of the Carthaginian army stationed there as marines. It was intercepted by the Roman fleet and in a hard-fought battle, the better-trained Romans defeated the undermanned and ill-trained Carthaginian fleet, which was further handicapped by being laden with supplies and having not yet embarked its full complement of marines. As a direct result, Carthage sued for peace and agreed to the Treaty of Lutatius, by which Carthage surrendered Sicily to Rome and paid substantial reparations. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. Primary sources The main source for almost every aspect of the First Punic War is the historian Polybius ( ‚Äì 118 BC), a Greek sent to Rome in 167 BC as a hostage. His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics, but he is known today for The Histories, written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the Battle of the Aegates. Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view. Carthaginian written records were destroyed along with their capital, Carthage, in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, Greek and Latin sources. Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about. Only the first book of the 40 comprising The Histories deals with the First Punic War. The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account. The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \\"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\\"; while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \\"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\\". Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form, and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea. Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of Diodorus Siculus and Dio Cassius, although the classicist Adrian Goldsworthy states that \\"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\\". Other sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the trireme Olympias. Since 2010 a number of artefacts have been recovered from the battle site, and their analysis and the recovery of further items are ongoing. Background=Operations in Sicily In 264 BC, the states of Carthage and Rome went to war, starting the First Punic War. Carthage was a well-established maritime power in the western Mediterranean; mainland Italy south of the River Arno had recently been unified under Roman control. The immediate cause of the war was control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern Messina). More broadly both sides wished to control Syracuse, the most powerful city-state on Sicily. Ships During this period the standard Mediterranean warship was the quinquereme, meaning \\"five-oared\\". The quinquereme was a galley, long, wide at water level, with its deck standing above the sea, and displacing around 100 tonnes (110 short tons; 100 long tons). The galley expert John Coates suggested that they could maintain 7 knots (8 mph; 13 km/h) for extended periods. The modern replica galley Olympias has achieved speeds of 8.5 knots (10 mph; 16 km/h) and cruised at for hours on end. Average speeds of 5‚Äì6 knots (6‚Äì7 mph; 9‚Äì11 km/h) were recorded on contemporary voyages of up to a week. Vessels were built as cataphract, or \\"protected\\", ships, with a closed hull and a full deck able to carry marines and catapults. They had a separate \\"oar box\\" attached to the main hull which contained the rowers. These features allowed the hull to be strengthened, increased carrying capacity and improved conditions for the rowers. The generally accepted theory regarding the arrangement of oarsmen in quinqueremes is that there would be sets ‚Äì or files ‚Äì of three oars, one above the other, with two oarsmen on each of the two uppermost oars and one on the lower, for a total of five oarsmen per file. This would be repeated down the side of a galley for a total of 28 files on each side; 168 oars in total. The Romans had little prior naval experience; on the few occasions they had previously felt the need for a naval presence they had usually relied on small squadrons provided by their Latin or Greek allies. In 260 BC the Romans set out to construct a fleet and used a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own. As novice shipwrights, the Romans built copies that were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, and thus slower and less manoeuvrable. The quinquereme provided the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout the Punic Wars, although hexaremes (six oarsmen per bank), quadriremes (four oarsmen per bank) and triremes (three oarsmen per bank) are also occasionally mentioned. So ubiquitous was the type that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for \\"warship\\" in general. A quinquereme carried a crew of 300: 280 oarsmen and 20 deck crew and officers; it would also normally carry a complement of 40 marines; if battle was thought to be imminent this would be increased to as many as 120. Getting the oarsmen to row as a unit, let alone to execute more complex battle manoeuvres, required long and arduous training. At least half of the oarsmen would need to have had some experience if the ship was to be handled effectively. As a result, the Romans were initially at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. All warships were equipped with a ram, a triple set of bronze blades weighing up to positioned at the waterline. They were made individually by the lost-wax method to fit immovably to a galley's prow, and secured with bronze spikes. Ideally one would attack an enemy ship from its side or rear, thus avoiding the possibility of being rammed oneself. Skill was required to impact an opposing galley forcefully enough to break loose its timbers and cause it to founder, but not so forcefully as to embed one's own galley in the stricken enemy. Each vessel relied to a large extent on the other vessels in its squadron for protection, and tactics involved the manoeuvring of whole squadrons rather than individual ships; although battles sometimes broke down into a series of ship on ship combats which have been likened to aerial dogfights. 264‚Äì250 BC Largely because of the Romans' invention of the , a device which enabled them to grapple and board enemy vessels more easily, the Carthaginians were defeated in large naval battles at Mylae (260 BC), Sulci (257 BC), Ecnomus (256 BC) and Cape Hermaeum (255 BC). Shortly after the last of these, the large majority of the Roman fleet was destroyed in a storm, with an estimated loss of 100,000 men; the instability of the Roman ships in heavy weather due to the presence of the may have contributed to this disaster. In any event, they did not use the thereafter. The Romans rapidly rebuilt their fleet, only to lose a further 150 ships to another storm in 253 BC. They rebuilt again, and in 250 BC blockaded the main Carthaginian base on Sicily of Lilybaeum with 200 warships. The Carthaginians regained command of the sea in 249 BC with victories over the blockading Roman fleet at Drepana and Phintias. These defeats so demoralized the Romans that they restricted their naval activities to small-scale operations for seven years. The absence of Roman fleets probably led Carthage to gradually decommission most of her navy. Goldsworthy states that the Carthaginian navy became inactive and considers it likely that few ships were kept in commission. Certainly they withdrew most of their warships from Sicily. The Carthaginian leadership preferred to expand their area of control in North Africa at the expense of the native Numidians. Hanno the Great was put in charge of operations in Africa in 248 BC and went on to conquer considerable territory by 241 BC. The historian Nigel Bagnall considers that during this period Carthage viewed Sicily as a secondary theatre. Prelude alt=A map of Sicily showing the small amount of territory controlled by Carthage By 248 BC, the war had lasted 15 years, with many changes of fortune. It had developed into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to decisively defeat the Carthaginians and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily. The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty. Rome had gained control of most of Sicily and the Carthaginians retained only two cities on the island: Lilybaeum and Drepana; these were well-fortified and situated on the west coast, where they could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere. When Hamilcar Barca took command of the Carthaginians on Sicily in 247 BC he was only given a small army and the Carthaginian fleet was gradually withdrawn. Hostilities between Roman and Carthaginian forces declined to small-scale land operations, which suited the Carthaginian strategy. Hamilcar employed combined arms tactics in a Fabian strategy from his base at Eryx, north of Drepana. This guerrilla warfare kept the Roman legions pinned down and preserved Carthage's foothold in Sicily. Early in the blockade of Lilybaeum and Drepana, 50 Carthaginian quinqueremes gathered off the Aegates Islands, which lie 15‚Äì40 kilometres (9‚Äì25 mi) to the west of Sicily. Once there was a strong west wind they sailed into Lilybaeum before the Romans could react. They unloaded reinforcementseither 4,000 or 10,000 according to different ancient sourcesand a large quantity of supplies. They evaded the Romans by leaving at night, evacuating the Carthaginian cavalry. The Romans had sealed off the landward approach to Lilybaeum with earth and timber camps and walls, and now made repeated attempts to block the harbour entrance with a heavy timber boom; due to the prevailing sea conditions they were unsuccessful. The two Carthaginian garrisons were kept supplied by blockade runners. These were light and manoeuvrable quinqueremes with highly trained crews and pilots who knew the shoals and currents of the difficult waters. Chief among the blockade runners was a galley captained by Hannibal the Rhodian, who taunted the Romans with the superiority of his vessel and crew. Eventually the Romans captured Hannibal, and his well-constructed galley. By 243 BC, after more than 20 years of war, both states were financially and demographically exhausted. Evidence of Carthage's financial situation includes their request for a 2,000-talent loan from Ptolemaic Egypt, which was refused. Rome was also close to bankruptcy and the number of adult male citizens, who provided the manpower for the navy and the legions, had declined by 17 per cent since the start of the war. New Roman fleet In late 243 BC, realizing they would not capture Drepana and Lilybaeum unless they could extend their blockade to the sea, the Roman Senate decided to build a new fleet. With the state's coffers exhausted, the Senate approached Rome's wealthiest citizens for loans to finance the construction of one ship each, repayable from the reparations to be imposed on Carthage once the war was won, and to donate slaves as oarsmen. The result was a fleet of approximately 200 quinqueremes, built, equipped, and crewed without government expense. The Romans modelled the ships of their new fleet on the vessel captured from Hannibal the Rhodian. By now, the Romans were experienced at shipbuilding and with a proven vessel as a model produced high-quality quinqueremes. Importantly, the was abandoned, which improved the ships' speed and handling but forced a change in tactics on the Romans; they would need to be superior sailors, rather than superior soldiers, to beat the Carthaginians. The new Roman fleet was completed in 242 BC and the consul Gaius Lutatius Catulus, assisted by the praetor Quintus Valerius Falto, led it to Sicily. Arriving with the 200 quinqueremes and 700 transports laden with supplies and legionary reinforcements, Catulus seized the harbour of Drepana and the anchorages off Lilybaeum uncontested, as there were no Carthaginian ships to counter the Roman fleet. Catulus and Falto kept a strong squadron off each city whenever the weather permitted, to avoid any possibility of Carthaginian supplies getting past them, and to drill the crews in manoeuvres and exercises. They also ensured that the crews received good treatment, including an adequate diet, and created a fleet with crews at the peak of their ability. Impressed by the energy of Catulus and Falto, the Senate extended their terms of office beyond the normal one year, and they thus became proconsul and propraetor respectively. The garrisons of Lilybaeum and Drepanaand Hamilcar's army at Eryxheld fast, but without supplies from Carthage they could not hold out indefinitely. Carthage began to ready a fleet, fit out transports, gather supplies and train crews and marines to meet the Roman challenge. It took nine months to ready 250 warships and between 150 and 350 transports. Carthage was pressed for time as supplies in their blockaded strongholds were running out. They struggled to find the 100,000 men necessary to fully crew just the warships, and did not have sufficient time to provide the extended training necessary for the crews to work together effectively as teams. Battle alt=A map showing the locations of the Aegates Islands The Carthaginian fleet was led by a commander named Hanno; he is distinguished from other Carthaginians named Hanno by being known as the son of Hannibal. This is possibly the general who had lost the Battles of Agrigentum and Ecnomus; although the historian John Lazenby considers it likely that he had been executed for his earlier failures. It is not known why the victors of Drepana, Adherbal and Carthalo, were not in command. The Carthaginian plan was to assemble their fleet of 250 quinqueremes and a large but unknown number of transports in secret off Hiera (Holy Island), the westernmost of the Aegates islands. There they would wait for a following wind, and rely on surprise and numbers to take them the to Lilybaeum before the Romans became aware and concentrated their fleet. This would have been a repeat of the successful Carthaginian feat with a smaller fleet several years before. They would then unload their cargoes, mostly grain, and embark much of the Carthaginian army to be used as marines on their quinqueremes. These would then configure themselves for fighting and seek out the Roman fleet. It is unclear, given the many transports available, why the Carthaginian warships were also laden with cargo; and why they were not already carrying marines taken from their forces in Africa. The Carthaginian fleet arrived off Hiera in early March 241 BC. The Carthaginian fleet was spotted by Roman scouts and Catulus abandoned the blockade and took on board his 200 quinqueremes a full complement of marines from the soldiers of the besieging Roman army. The Roman fleet then sailed and anchored off the island of Aegusa, from Sicily. Next morning, 10 March, the wind was blowing strongly from the west, and the current was running the same way. Hanno immediately set sail for Lilybaeum. Catulus measured the risk of attacking with the wind in his bow versus the risk of letting Hanno reach Sicily to relieve Lilybaeum, Drepana and Hamilcar's army. Despite the unfavourable conditions, the proconsul decided to intercept the Carthaginians and ordered his fleet to prepare for battle. He had the Roman ships stripped of their masts, sails and other unnecessary equipment to make them more seaworthy in the rough conditions. Catulus himself was unable to join the battle because of injuries suffered in an earlier engagement, so in the battle the ships were commanded by his second in command, Falto. The opposing fleets met to the west of the island of Phorbantia (modern Levanzo). Many fragments of lead anchors have been recovered from near the island of Levanzo, causing the archaeologist Sebastiano Tusa to speculate that the Roman fleet paused here and that its ships then deliberately cut their anchors, to reduce the weight they carriedeach anchor weighed . The Romans formed a single line of ships and rowed into the wind, through a heavy swell, towards the Carthaginians. Having little choice, the Carthaginians lowered their sails and engaged. In the ensuing battle the Romans enjoyed far greater mobility, since their vessels were carrying only the bare necessities, while the Carthaginians were burdened with the equipment necessary for sustained travel and provisions for the Sicilian garrisons. The Carthaginian crews had also been hurriedly levied and so were inexperienced, and their ships were short of marines, as it had been intended that these would be supplemented from Hamilcar's soldiers. It was the second time that a Roman fleet had fought the Carthaginians without employing the the first time, at the Battle of Drepana, they were badly beaten but they quickly gained the upper hand, using their ships' greater manoeuvrability to ram the Carthaginian vessels. The Roman ships were a match for their opponents, modelled as they were on one of the best of the Carthaginians', and their crews were superior. The Romans sank 50 Carthaginian ships, 20 of them with all hands, and 70 were captured along with 10,000 men. However, the battle was hard-fought, and the Romans lost 30 ships sunk and another 50 damaged. The rest of the Carthaginian fleet was saved only by an abrupt change in the direction of the wind, allowing them to flee; as the Romans had left their masts, sails and rigging ashore, they were unable to pursue. The Carthaginian remnants returned to Carthage, where their unsuccessful commander was crucified. Aftermath alt=A photograph of Roman ruins in a modern street setting Catulus was granted a triumph to celebrate his victory, while Falto was granted a separate and slightly junior triumph. To celebrate the victory, Catulus built a temple to Juturna in the Campus Martius, in the area of Rome currently known as the Largo di Torre Argentina. After achieving this decisive victory over the Carthaginian fleet, Catulus continued the land operations in Sicily against Lilybaeum, Eryx and Drepana; which continued to be defended by Hamilcar Barca and his army. The Carthaginian Senate was reluctant to allocate the resources necessary to have another fleet built and manned. Carthage had taken nine months to fit out the fleet that was defeated, and if they took another nine months to ready another fleet, the Sicilian cities still holding out would run out of supplies and request terms. Strategically, therefore, Carthage would have to build a fleet capable of defeating the Roman fleet, and then raise an army capable of defeating the Roman armies in Sicily. Instead, the Carthaginian Senate ordered Hamilcar to negotiate a peace treaty with the Romans, which he left up to his subordinate commander, Gisco. The Treaty of Lutatius was signed in the same year as the Battle of the Aegates and brought the First Punic War to its end; Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an indemnity of 3,200 talents over ten years. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. The Romans had built over 1,000 galleys during the war; and this experience of building, manning, training, supplying and maintaining such numbers of ships laid the foundation for Rome's maritime dominance for 600 years. Marine archaeology Since 2010 eleven bronze warship rams have been found by archaeologists in the sea within a area off Phorbantia, along with ten bronze helmets and hundreds of amphorae. The rams, seven of the helmets, and six intact amphorae, along with a number of fragments, have since been recovered. Inscriptions allowed four of the rams to be identified as coming from Roman-built ships, one from a Carthaginian vessel, with the origins of the remaining two being unknown. It is possible that some of the Roman-built vessels had been captured by the Carthaginians earlier in the war and were crewed by them when they were sunk. It is believed that the rams were each attached to a sunken warship when they were deposited on the seabed. Six of the helmets were of the Montefortino type typically used by the legions, three with one or both bronze cheek pieces still attached; the seventh, badly corroded, was of a different design and may be Carthaginian. The archaeologists involved stated that the location of artefacts so far discovered supports Polybius's account of where the battle took place. Based on the dimensions of the recovered rams, the archaeologists who have studied them believe that they all came from triremes, contrary to Polybius's account of all of the warships involved being quinqueremes. However, they believe that the many amphora identified confirm that the Carthaginian ships were laden with supplies.

On 1 June 1965, reporter Roy Smith described plans for the then unbuilt junction as a \\"cross between a plate of spaghetti and an unsuccessful attempt at a Staffordshire knot\\" and sub-editor Alan Eaglesfield headlined the article \\"Spaghetti Junction\\". The asymmetrical junction provides access to and from the A38 (Tyburn Road), A38(M) (Aston Expressway), the A5127 (Lichfield Road/Gravelly Hill), and several unclassified local roads. It covers , serves 18 routes and includes of slip roads, but only of the M6 itself. Across 5 different levels, it has 559 concrete columns, reaching up to . The engineers had to elevate of motorway to accommodate two railway lines, three canals, and two rivers. In 1958, the Ministry of Transport commissioned the engineering firm, Sir Owen Williams & Partners, to investigate possible routes to connect the M6, the A38(M) and the A38 trunk road.https://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/heritage/england/birmingham/article_1.shtml The development of the interchange was approved and announced in August 1968 by the then Minister of Transport, Richard Marsh. Construction was expected to take three years and to cost ¬£8m. The interchange at night, as seen from a police helicopter Construction started in 1968 and the junction was opened in May 1972 by the then Secretary of State for the Environment, Peter Walker. The opening was delayed by several months because of \\"box girder inspections\\". These followed the interim report of the Merrison Enquiry set up following the collapse of similar box girder bridges in Australia and Wales. In an unusual meeting of old and new transport technology, the pillars supporting the flyovers over the Birmingham Canal Navigations had to be carefully placed to enable a horse-drawn canal boat to pass under the interchange without fouling the towing rope. The junction has undergone major repair work several times since, owing to the very heavy traffic through the junction, and some alleged cost-saving measures during its construction. In November 2007, a sliproad running from the Tyburn Road onto the Aston Expressway was closed to undergo urgent repair works. Upon inspection, it was found that Spaghetti Junction itself was in need of repair work because salt and grit had weakened the joints in the structure. The student magazine of Birmingham City University, Spaghetti Junction, takes its name from the interchange's nickname. South-East of the junction, the M6 is on the elevated Bromford Viaduct - the longest viaduct in the UK.

Scipio Asina was a patrician member of the Scipiones branch of the famous Cornelii, a family with a history as old as the Roman Republic itself. He was son of Lucius Cornelius Scipio Barbatus and brother of Lucius Cornelius Scipio (consul 259 BC). Elected senior consul for the year 260 BC, Scipio Asina had the honour of commanding the first Roman fleet launched to the Mediterranean Sea. While patrolling the waters of the Messina strait between Italy and Sicily with the first vessels, Scipio Asina received the information that Lipara, in the Lipari Islands, was about to change to the Roman side. Eager to secure such an important port and to cover himself with glory, he rushed to the islands without considering security. It is not sure if the Carthaginians planned the whole affair, but the Roman fleet was trapped in the harbor by Hannibal Gisco. Without naval warfare experience, the crews panicked and escaped to land, leaving the ships unattended and Scipio Asina to be made prisoner by the Carthaginians. Although there was hardly any fighting, the encounter is known as the Battle of the Lipari Islands. His mishap earned him the pejorative cognomen of Asina (\\"ass\\", literally \\"female donkey\\", in Latin), given by political opponents. Neither the humiliation, nor his loss, ended his career; in 254 BC, Scipio Asina was elected consul for the second time and, with his co-consul Aulus Atilius Caiatinus, succeeded in the conquest of Panormus (Palermo, now capital of Sicily).

The large gardens of the Buildings are nestled between Government Avenue, Vermeulen Street East, Church Street, the R104 and Blackwood Street. Fairview Avenue is a closed road where only officials can enter to the Union Buildings.union buildings ‚Äì Google Maps Though not in the centre of Pretoria, the Union Buildings occupy the highest point of Pretoria, and constitute a South African national heritage site. The Buildings are one of the centres of political life in South Africa; \\"The Buildings\\" and \\"Arcadia\\" have become metonyms for the South African government. It has become an iconic landmark of Pretoria and South Africa in general, and is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the city and an emblem of democracy. The Buildings are the location of presidential inaugurations. Architecture The eastern wing of The Union Buildings represents the English population of South Africa These buildings, built from light sandstone, were designed by the architect Sir Herbert Baker in the English monumental style and are 285 m long. They have a semi-circular shape, with the two wings at the sides, this serves to represent the union of a formerly divided people. The clock chimes are identical to those of Big Ben in London.Union Buildings, Pretoria, South Africa The east and west wings, as well as the twin-domed towers, represent two languages, English and Afrikaans, and the inner court was designed and built to symbolise the Union of South Africa.Union Building in Pretoria (South Africa) These buildings are considered by many to be the architect's greatest achievement and a South African architectural masterpiece. The Nelson Mandela statue in Sandton City's Nelson Mandela Square was commissioned originally to stand on the spot where Nelson Mandela gave his inaugural address.RIVIERA Attractions The building was sited on a disused quarry, which now makes up the amphitheatre. The matching statues on top of the domed towers are Atlas, holding up the world, sculpted by Abraham Broadbent. The statue on the domed rostrum in the amphitheatre between the wings is Mercury, a mythic Roman messenger and a god of trade, sculpted by George Ness. The closest suburb to the Union Buildings is Arcadia, which means \\"Playground of Gods\\". Pretoria has the second largest number of embassies in the world, after Washington, D.C., most of which are located in or near Arcadia. View from the gardens The design of each level differs, and therefore each stone had to be individually cut. The Architectural styles of the building ranges from the lower levels' Edwardian style to the top levels' Cape Dutch design with shutters on the windows. The windows from bottom to top are elongated and become shorter towards the top floor. This is to give the illusion of height. The Union Buildings are the site of presidential inaugurations. The official offices of the president are on the left-hand side of the Union Buildings, and the South African national flag is flown on the left-hand side if the president is in office.Sunset Africa ‚Äì Pretoria The Buildings are divided into three sections; the left offices, amphitheatre, and right offices. All are 95 metres in length. Each offices block contains three inner courtyards providing light and air to the offices. Each block has a basement and three floors above ground. The central curved building behind the colonnade houses the committee rooms, a library and conference rooms while the basement contains the kitchen, dining rooms and lounges. The interior is treated in the Cape Dutch style: carved teak fanlights, heavy doors, dark ceiling beams contrasting with white plaster walls and heavy wood furniture.The Union Building History Circa 1925 The Boer Republics of the ZAR and the Orange Free State were united with the Cape Colony and Natal Colony in 1910 to become the Union of South Africa. Pretoria then became the administrative capital of the whole of South Africa, with Cape Town the legislative capital. Between 1860 and 1994, the city was also the capital of the province of Transvaal, superseding Potchefstroom in that role. The new Union required a governmental building which could signify unity and host the new government. Marthinus Wessel Pretorius, later to become first president of the Transvaal Republic, was the original owner of the farm 'Elandsfontein' on which Meintjieskop stands. In 1856 Andries Francois du Toit (1813‚Äì1883), in exchange for a Basotho pony, acquired part of the farm, which he named Arcadia and on which the Union Buildings were later constructed.Standard Encyclopaedia of Southern Africa vol.7 He was also Pretoria's first magistrate and was responsible for the layout of the city. During this period he sold his land to Stephanus Jacobus Meintjies (1819‚Äì1887), after whom the hill is named. In 1909 Herbert Baker was commissioned to design the Government Building of the Union of South Africa (which was formed on 31 May 1910) in Pretoria. Pretoria was to become the administrative centre for the new government. In November 1910 the cornerstone of the Union Building was laid. Lord Selborne and H.C. Hull, a member of the first Union Cabinet, chose Meintjieskop as the site for Baker's design. The site was that of a disused quarry and the existing excavations were used to create the amphitheatre, which was set about with ornamental pools, fountains, sculptures, balustrades and trees. View of the Union Buildings from the front with statue of Louis Botha in the foreground. The design consisted of two identical wings, joined by a semicircular colonnade forming the backdrop of the amphitheatre. The colonnade was terminated on either side by a tower. Each wing had a basement and three floors above ground. The interiors were created in the Cape Dutch style with carved teak fanlights, heavy doors, dark ceiling beams contrasting with white plaster walls and heavy wood furniture. Baker used indigenous materials as far as possible. The granite was quarried on site while Buiskop sandstone was used for the courtyards. Stinkwood and Rhodesian teak were used for timber and wood panelling. The roof tiles and quarry tiles for the floors were made in Vereeniging. The cornerstone was laid in November 1910, shortly after the Union of South Africa ‚Äì for which the buildings are named ‚Äì was formed. Taking 1,265 workers over three years to build, the structure was completed in 1913 at a total cost of ¬£1,310,640 for the building and ¬£350,000 for the site. Designed by Sir Herbert Baker in 1908, building began in 1909 and was completed in 1913. It took approximately 1265 artisans, workmen and labourers almost three years to construct, using 14 million bricks for the interior office walls, half a million cubic feet of freestone, 74 000 cubic yards of concrete, 40 000 bags of cement and 20 000 cubic feet of granite. Originally built to house the entire Public Service for the Union of South Africa, it was then the largest building in the country and possibly the largest building work undertaken in the Southern Hemisphere at that time. Several other sites were considered, including Muckleneuk Ridge, on the opposite side of the city, and Pretorius Square, in the centre of Pretoria, where the City Hall now stands. However, Herbert Baker was strongly in favour of Meintjieskop, which was within a mile of the centre of Pretoria and reminded him strongly of some of the acropolises of Greece and Asia Minor, where he had studied Mediterranean architecture. The concept of an acropolis and a building that agreed with renowned British Architect Sir Christopher Wren's theory that a public building should be a national ornament which establishes a nation, draws people and commerce and makes people love their country easily persuaded the then powers that be, who were at the time, preoccupied with the ideal of establishing a new and united nation. The British high commissioner at the time, Lord Selborne, remarked; > People will come from all over the world to wonder at the beauty of the site > and to admire the forethought and courage of the men who selected it. Historic naval gun outside the buildings The design of the buildings was largely determined by the nature of the site. Baker envisaged identical wings of rectangular office blocks, each representing one of the two official languages. They were to be linked by a semicircular wing, and the space in- between the two wings was levelled to bring form an amphitheatre as in the Greek fashion for gatherings of national and ceremonial importance. Baker wanted the buildings to be built of imported granite, but any idea of using anything but South African stone for the most important government building of the new state was unthinkable to those who commissioned it, as a result, the terraces and retaining walls in the grounds are built predominantly of mountain stone quarried on site, the foundation of the building is of granite, while freestone was used for the exterior walls, the amphitheatre and major courtyards. For the overall design of the building, Baker chose the neo- classic architecture of the Italian Renaissance, and also combined an idiom of the English Renaissance, as well as significant elements of Cape Dutch detail, such as in the carved main doorways and fanlights and in much of the wrought- iron brass work and balustrades of the smaller areas. Historical events On 9 August 1956, 20,000 women marched to the doors of the Union Buildings, chanting \\"Wathint' Abafazi, wathint' imbokodo!\\" which means \\"strike the women, strike the rock\\", to protest against the pass laws of 1950. This historical event is commemorated by the public holiday National Women's Day. Wilma Cruise and Marcus Holmes were approached to design a memorial to commemorate the Women's March. They made use of the \\"imbokodo\\". The imbokodo is a grinding stone used by the women to grind maize. Cruise and Holmes, rested the imbokodo, representing nurture and sustenance, on bronze plates, representing the earth and fire. There are two sets of stairs leading to the memorial, and on each step, raised in bronzed letters are the words from 'The Demand of the Women of South Africa for the Withdrawal of Passes for Women and Repeal of the Pass Laws.' On approaching the imbokodo, you will trigger infrared beams, which activates history's \\"whispered voices\\", echoed in all 11 official languages, the rally cry, repeated softly.Union Building, Pretoria  By South Africa Channel In 1986, significant restoration of the Union Buildings was undertaken by Johan de Ridder and T.W.

Starting at the bottom of the gardens, a large statue of General Louis Botha (first prime minister of the Union of South Africa) on horseback dominates the lawn. South African Police Memorial. About halfway up the terraces, the Delville Wood War Memorial is a tribute to South African troops who died during the First World War as well as a plaque in memory of those that died during the Korean War. Two levels above that is a statue of President Nelson Mandela. This replaced the statue of General J.B.M. Hertzog, a former Prime Minister, which can still be found on the grounds. The South African Police Memorial is located at the top right of the gardens. The South African National Film, Video and Sound Archives is also located in the grounds of the Union Buildings, adjacent to the Police Memorial.

The region is formed of mountains, hills, plains, valleys and desert stretches. This region is situated in the Hejaz, between longitudes 41/42 E and latitudes 19/20 N. The region covers an area about 36,000 km¬≤. Major cities * Al Bahah * Baljurashi * Almandaq * Almikhwah * Alaqeeq Topography The region is divided by huge rocky steeps into two main sectors. To the west is a coastal plain, Tihamah. East is the mountain range of al-Sarawat, known as Al-Sarat, with an elevation of above sea level. Population A genealogist has confirmed that the majority of the population of Al-Ba·∏•ah are descended from the Azad Shenou\`a tribe which emigrated from the south of the Hejaz in the Arabian peninsula, following some historical natural events. Al-Azad is an Arab tribe which is divided into 24 tribes derived from four stocks: Azad Shenou\`a, Azad Al Sarat, Azad Ghassan and Azad Aman. Al-Azad (or al-Assad the Lion) was the title given to Darda\`e bin al-Ghot bin Nabt bin Malik bin Nassr al-Azad. Kaab bin al-Harith had seven children including Ghamed, who is Amr bin Abdullah bin Kaab. Zahran bin al-Harith had six children, including Abdullah bin Zahran who is the great grandfather of the Zahran tribe. The population of the region now is about 500,000. Many have moved to major metropolitan areas for better living and education. Climate The variation in topography influences the climate of the region. Al-Sarat area is exposed to the formation of clouds and fog, and this often happens in winter because of air masses coming from the Red Sea, accompanied by thunderstorms. In spring and summer the climate is mild and pleasant. The climate in the area of the Tihamah is different from that in Al-Sarat, although they are separated by no more than . Tihama is an undulating coastal plain, hot in summer, warm in spring and mild in winter. The climate in general falls in the arid zone. Relative humidity varies between 52% and 67%, with maximum temperatures of , and minimum temperatures of . Social structure The social life of the inhabitants of the region is based on Sunni Islam, in addition to the well established Arab customs and tradition. Each tribe division or subdivision has its own shaykh (, head).

It has portions designated as the Barstow, Escondido, and Armed Forces Freeways. I-215 is a bypass auxiliary route of I-15, running from Murrieta to northern San Bernardino. While I-215 connects the city centers of both Riverside and San Bernardino, its parent I-15 runs to the west through Corona and Ontario. Part of I-215 was once signed as Interstate 15E (I-15E), but this was changed in 1974 as almost all of the Interstates around the country with directional suffixes were eventually renumbered or eliminated. Route description The southern terminus of I-215 is at the junction of I-15 in the city of Murrieta, in southwestern Riverside County. It then runs north through Menifee and northwest through Perris, passing March Air Reserve Base before joining State Route 60 (SR 60) in Riverside, near the Moreno Valley city limits. From just north of downtown Perris to the eastern portion of Riverside near the unincorporated area of Box Springs, the tracks of Metrolink's 91/Perris Valley Line run parallel to the freeway. I-215 overlaps with SR 60 for about in Riverside and splits from it at SR 91, where it then travels north through Colton, Grand Terrace and San Bernardino before turning northwest and rejoining I-15 near the small San Bernardino neighborhood of Devore. This route is an alternative to I-15 for drivers traveling from Phoenix, Las Vegas, or San Bernardino, to the San Diego metropolitan area. This route offers a slight distance advantage as an alternative to I-15's alignment about to the west of (and roughly parallel to) I-215. The distance between the two I-15/I-215 junctions is almost shorter using I-215 rather than I-15. However, the traffic and time \\"advantage\\" on I-215 is limited by three factors: the segment between the I-15/I-215 \\"Devore junction\\" and north of SR 210 in San Bernardino only has two lanes in each direction (while I-15 has four), its co-designation with SR 60 and routing through Riverside requires motorists in both directions to \\"change freeways\\" to remain on I-215, and that most of I-215 has a 65 mph (105 km/h) speed limit (except for a short segment in northern San Bernardino, which has a 70 mph (110 km/h) speed limit). The junction of I-15 and I-215 in Murrieta I-215 is also used by local residents as the major north‚Äìsouth route for the urbanized portions of the San Bernardino‚ÄìRiverside‚ÄìOntario metropolitan area. (I-15 serves a similar function in the western portion of the metropolitan area; the two are the only continuous north‚Äìsouth freeways in the area.) I-215 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. I-215 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. On January 24, 1957, the State Highway Commission defined the Escondido Freeway as what is now Routes 15 and 215 from Route 805 to Route 91. This entire segment was previously Route 395 when it was named. From the SR 60/SR 91 interchange in Riverside to I-10 near San Bernardino, the highway is known as the Riverside Freeway. Between Highland Avenue in San Bernardino and its northern terminus, I-215 is named the Barstow Freeway. Unofficially, I-215 is known as the Armed Forces Freeway between I-15 and SR 60, given its proximity to the March Air Reserve Base.Google Maps History The highway (not an Interstate) that is currently I-215 first opened in 1963 as part of U.S. Route 395 (US 395). The \\"mileposts\\" in Riverside County reflect this since they do not start at zero at the I-15 interchange in Murrieta. Around 1968, U.S. 395 was renumbered as I-15 (the original proposed route, as SR 71's proposed number was I-15W/SR 31 Hamner-Milliken). This segment of US 395 was again renumbered in 1972 as (Temporary) I-15E. Next in 1974, this route was renumbered as State Route 194. In 1982, this route was then renumbered as I-215 north of SR 60, and as State Route 215 south of SR 60\\\\. Once SR 215 was upgraded to Interstate Highway standards, it became part of I-215 in 1994. Prior to its upgrade to Interstate standards, there were traffic signals at SR 74, as well as at Alessandro Boulevard (in Moreno Valley); two railroad crossings had also intersected the I-215 expressway at SR 74 and south of Cactus Avenue at then-March Air Force Base. Due to the fact that the I-215 designation was overlaid upon existing freeways between the southern junction with SR 60 and the city of San Bernardino, the SR 60/SR 91/I-215 interchange in the city of Riverside has been widely known for its confusing nature concerning the numbering of I-215. While SR 60 continues east-and-west through this interchange, and SR 91 continues southwest (and formerly to the north), the I-215 designation continues away from this interchange on SR 60 east and the former northern portion of SR 91 (now solely numbered I-215). Travelers following I-215 in either direction need to \\"change freeways\\" at this interchange, instead of just following through lanes. The interchange was reconstructed to include some high-speed flyovers, one of which carries I-215 southbound traffic. In addition, when I-215 temporarily co-signs SR 60 in Riverside, the mileposts for I-215 supersede mileposts for SR 60\\\\. Motorists traveling east-west on SR 60 must begin counting exits at a new number, in the reverse order, during the I-215 overlap. San Bernardino widening project A joint project between Caltrans and SANBAG of San Bernardino County to widen I-215 between Orange Show Road and University Parkway in San Bernardino began in 2007. With its completion, the project added one general use lane and one carpool lane in each direction, bringing the total number of lanes from six to 10 lanes across. The 7.5-mile, $723 million project included the reconstruction of all underpasses and overpasses within the project as well as connector ramps between I-215 and SR 210\\\\. This major expansion and revitalization project will help reduce congestion and improve traffic flow on this freeway that serves as a gateway to the Victor Valley, Riverside County, Orange County, Los Angeles County and points beyond. The widening was completed in late 2013, and all construction signage and equipment were completely removed by Spring of 2014.SANBAG: Measure I Freeway Projects Construction between Inland Center Drive and Orange Show Road in San Bernardino *Phase 1 status: Reconstruction of 5th Street Bridge. Work began in January 2007 and was completed in November 2008, approximately six months ahead of schedule and $2 million under budget. The 5th Street bridge was built in phases with the new bridge being constructed alongside the old structure to allow for continuous use of the east/west corridor during construction. *Phase 2 status: Freeway widening between Orange Show Road and Rialto Avenue. Construction began on Phase 2 in December 2007 and was completed in July 2010. In addition to the reconstruction of various bridges, the freeway was widened from three to five lanes in each direction through this stretch of road. Aesthetic wallscapes depict the City‚Äôs iconic symbols including palm trees, the San Bernardino mountain range, fountains representing the local springs and more. *Phase 3 status: Freeway widening between Rialto Avenue to Massachusetts Avenue. Construction began in September 2009 and finished in mid-2013. This phase received $128 million in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) funds, one of the largest allocations of funding to a construction project in the country. As part of this phase, the freeway was widened from three to five lanes in each direction along with the reconstruction of various bridges and underpasses. Following construction completion, all fast-lane entrances and exits were eliminated with drivers using new 5th Street and Baseline Street on-ramps that connect directly to the newly constructed bridges. This new configuration provides more balanced access to the west and east sides of the city. Also, residents living alongside the northbound side of the freeway have a soundwall to help block out freeway noise. *Phase 4 status: freeway widening between Massachusetts Avenue and University Parkway. Construction began in January 2010 and was completed in November 2012. A key feature in this phase was the construction of I-215/SR 210 connector ramps. Drivers now have direct access to these freeways in all directions. In addition to a general-purpose and carpool lane added in each direction south of the I-215/SR 210 interchange, a southbound auxiliary lane and a northbound general-purpose lane have been added between University Parkway and the I-215/SR 210 interchange. Future Many improvements are in the works along the entire length of the Interstate 215 corridor. Several interchanges are planned to be built or are currently being improved, such as the interchange at Barton Road in Grand Terrace. The interchange at University Parkway in San Bernardino is planned to be converted into a diverging diamond interchange. Long-range plans include adding a carpool lane in each direction on a 10.75-mile section of I-215 between Nuevo Road in Perris and SR 60 near Moreno Valley. There are also plans to connect I-215 at its southern terminus to a planned collector- distributor system on I-15 near the Temecula-Murrieta border, providing access to interchanges at French Valley Parkway and Winchester Road.

It has an area of and an estimated population of 2,211,875 (2017). It shares a short border with the Saada Governorate of Yemen. The capital of the  øAsir Region is Abha. Other towns include Khamis Mushait, Bisha and Bareq. The regional governor is Turki bin Talal bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud (appointed 27 December 2018), a son of Prince Talal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud. He replaced his cousin, Faisal bin Khalid bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, on the same day.  Geography  The  øAsir Region is situated on a high plateau that receives more rainfall than the rest of the country and contains the country's highest peaks, which rise to almost at Jabal Sawda near Abha. Though data is exceedingly sparse and unreliable, the average annual rainfall in the highlands probably ranges from . It falls in two rainy seasons, the chief one being in March and April, with some rain in the summer. Temperatures are very extreme, with diurnal temperature ranges in the highlands the greatest in the world. It is common for afternoon temperatures to be over , yet mornings can be extremely frosty and fog can cut visibility to near zero percent. As a result, there is much more natural vegetation in  øAsir than in any other part of Saudi Arabia, with sheltered areas even containing areas of dense coniferous forests, though more exposed ridges still are very dry.  øAsir is home to many farmers who chiefly grow wheat and fruit crops. Irrigation has greatly expanded production in modern times.  Demographics  Governorates  The region is divided into sixteen governorates (with 2010 Census populationshttp://www.data.gov.sa/ar/node/1729/download): #Abha (+366,551) #Muhayil (+228,979) #An-Namas (+54,119) #Billasmar (+34,080) #Billahmar (+25,709) #Balqarn #Bareq (+74,391) #Bishah (+205,346) #Khamis Mushayt (+512,599) #Rijal Alma (+65,406) #Zahran Al-Janub (+63,119) #Tathlith (+59,188) #Sarat Abidah (+67,120) #Ahad Rifaydah (+113,043) #Al-Majardah (+103,531) #  History  In 25 B.C. Aelius Gallus marched his legions south from Egypt on a 1,300-mile expedition to take control of the ancient overland trade routes between the Mediterranean and what is now Hadhramaut in Yemen. The Romans wanted control of those routes because they were desperate for money and hoped to raise some by capturing Ma ærib, capital of Saba æ, and taking control of the trade in incense - then a priceless commodity - and other valuable aromatics. As it turned out, however, the expedition was a disaster and little information about  øAsir emerged. By 1920, however, Ibn Saud the founder of Saudi Arabia had begun to recoup the losses of the House of Sa øud and to unify most of the peninsula under his rule. As part of this campaign, he sent his Bedouin warriors also known as the Ikhwan to occupy  øAsir, and from then on  øAsir was controlled by the House of Sa øud - a situation formalized in 1934 with the signing of the Treaty of Ta æif between Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Even then the region was still largely unknown to the West. In 1932, St John Philby, one of the first Europeans to explore and map the peninsula, did enter  øAsir, but as he did not publish his observations until 1952, the area remained one of the blank spots on the world's map.  Economy  Historically,  øAsir was known for producing coffee, wheat, alfalfa, barley, senna, and frankincense. Wheat was grown in the summer and sesame has been grown in wetter areas of the region. Straw was used to make mats, hats, and baskets. Tribes in the area also wove tents from straw.  Development project  In 2019, the Saudi government launched an infrastructure development project in  øAsir Region. The project is expected to cost more than 1 billion Saudi Riyals. The provided projects will include health care, transportation and municipal services. The project is in line with the Saudi Vision 2030 to diversify non-petroleum income and activate new resources in Saudi Arabia.

It has an area of 149,511 km¬≤. Its capital is Najran. Najran is inhabited by the powerful Yam tribe, who have Yemeni origins. They have lived in the region for hundreds of years. Mishaal bin Abdullah was the governor from 2009 to 22 December 2013. The former governor was Mishaal bin Saud but he was relieved in 2008.http://www.kkh.med.sa/Portal/en/news-a-event/70-2010-03-18-00-20-19.html This move was closely related to the region's unique characteristics since the majority of people in this region are Shia Ismaili. 400,000 Ismailis reside in the region. The current governor of the region is Prince Jalawi Bin Abdul-Aziz Bin Mosaad. Etymology The name was attributed to Najran Ibn Zaidan Ibn Saba' Ibn Yashgub Ibn Yarub Ibn Qahtan because he was the first person to come to Najran and inhabit it. Geography Najran contains three geographical areas. First, the flat area which lies in the middle of Najran. It has several valleys, the most famous of them being Najran‚Äôs valley. Second, the mountainous area which is in the west and the north. There the weather is moderate in summer. It has several parks shaded by nabk trees. It has important governorate centers: Habuna governorate, Badr El-Junoob governorate and Yadmah governorate; the latter governorate won King Fahd‚Äôs attention because it has mineral wealth. The most important of all is the gold area where much gold was mined that lies in El-Johns area, which follows Safah center. Many of the mountains are distinguished by granite rocks, where marble and granite are quarried, providing a large part of the Kingdom‚Äôs needs. Third, the sandy area which lies in the east and is a part of the Empty Quarter. It is extremely rich in oil.

Christians have been absent from Najran for some centuries, and the remaining Jewish community is believed to have left in 1949, following the establishment of the state of Israel. Najran's Zaidi community in 2008 numbers around 2,000. The 2004 Saudi census puts the number of inhabitants in Najran at around 408,000. Sulaymani Ismailis, widely believed to constitute a large majority of the Najrani population, share a homogeneous identity based on historical, cultural, and religious roots. In Najran city, the Khushaiwa compound, with its Mansura mosque complex, is the spiritual capital of the Sulaymani branch of the Ismaili sect, one of two major strands of contemporary Ismailism. Ismailis in Najran belong mainly to one of two tribes: Yam and the Hamdan. These tribes extend into territory that today lies in Yemen. There are also some Sunnis of the Yam tribe, both recent converts and adherents to Sunni Islam for generations. Ancient Christian community Najran is known for an ancient settlement of Christians in the Arabian peninsula. They signed the Najran Pact in the 7th century with the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, promising them fair treatment as 'protected' subjects (dhimmi) of the newly conquered territories. The village is now abandoned. Culture=Cuisine The local dishes in Najran include: * Al-Burr: a breakfast meal which consists of bread made from wheat and flour, it is mixed and given the round ball shape and a hole is made to put milk, or honey, or dates honey on it, * Al-Wafed: a thick kind of bread made of wheat and is also made in round shape, it is served in Al-Matrah beside Al-Marg, * Al-Maasooba: made of corn flour meshed and some soup added is to make it soft, and it is usually served in a special ceremonies, * Ar- Ruksh: a soft kind of bread which comes in the shape of slice and it is served in the pot made of stone and then it is mixed with the soup, * Al-Margoog: consists of dough which is cut into small slices and it is cooked with soup and vegetables. Folk arts Najran has some folk arts including traditional clay techniques. The houses are built of light tan clay in the shape of a rectangle. On the other hand, Najran has different kinds of traditional dance. For example, Al-Zamil which is an enthusiastic kind of poetry refers to special occasion in which so many men share together in the middle of a circle formed by old men. The stanzas of Al-Zamil are chosen carefully to express the subject for the occasion. Furthermore, Al-Zamil is considered to express emotions, and some time for apologies. Al-Razffah describes a dance which is used for wedding, or for happy occasions. Choirs come into rows and they sing poetry. Al-Razffah has a special time and special voice. Between the two rows two men meet each other and they dance in specific movements holding stilettos or sticks in their hands. Also there is another art that is (Laa'bat Ateran) done by black men.

(otherwise known simply as ADF) is a non-profit religious organization dedicated to the study and further development of modern Druidry. In Modern Irish, √År nDra√≠ocht F√©in () means \\"our own magic (Druidism)\\". \\"ADF\\" is also used to represent the phrase A Druid Fellowship. The organization was founded in 1983 and incorporated in 1990 as a U.S. 501(c)3 non-profit organization by Isaac Bonewits. The organization's first public announcement and membership sign-up took place at the first WinterStar Symposium in 1984 at Burr Oak State Park in Glouster, OH. ADF was originally organized as an Association, with Articles of Association signed by all Trustees on April 18, 1987. Original Articles of Association of ADF at (1984). ADF is a neodruidic organization practicing a unique tradition of Neopagan Druidry and is mostly U.S.-based, with members and groups in most states and in several other countries as well. During the years 2000 through 2010 to the present, ADF's membership has remained well over 1000 persons, making it the largest public form of definitively Neopagan Druidism in the USA. Despite the Gaelic name, ADF Druidry actually encompasses all Indo- European religions, including Celtic, Germanic, Hellenic, Roman, Slavic, Gaulish, and Vedic religious practices. In that sense, ADF uses the term Druid as \\"a member of the Indo-European intelligentsia, especially of the clergy\\" or even more broadly as \\"a worshipper of Indo-European gods and goddesses\\". Strictly speaking, members of ADF are not only \\"druids\\", but are also members of related Indo-European religions which may have other terms for people in such clergy roles (e.g., gothi for clergy of ancient Norse religions). History Isaac Bonewits founded ADF with the goal of \\"researching and expanding sound modern scholarship about the ancient Celts and other Indo- European peoples, in order to reconstruct what the Old Religions of Europe really were.\\" Bonewits wanted to focus on scholarship as a reaction to more revisionist types of Neopaganism, such as those claiming direct descent from a \\"Great Matriarchy\\" of pre-historic times (see James Frazer's The Golden Bough). The works of Georges Dum√©zil on Indo-European social structures and mythologies were especially influential in Bonewits's thinking. Related to the focus on scholarship, Isaac started the ADF Study Program with the goal of producing credible, knowledgeable Neopagan clergy; actual druid priests and priestesses, who would be able to fulfill all the roles of modern clergy for other Neopagans, such as birth, marriage, and funerary rites. Similarly, ADF's official motto of \\"Why not excellence?\\" is an expression of the desire to create a bona fide religious tradition, rather than a small group that few would take seriously and which would not be around in a few years. ADF's unofficial motto, \\"As fast as a speeding oak,\\" is meant to remind members that excellence takes time. ADF was a reaction to many of the cultish pseudo- religions (Neopagan or not) with which Bonewits was familiar and (in a few cases) had experienced. Therefore, one of the first \\"dogmas\\" he promulgated was the \\"Doctrine of Archdruidic Fallibility\\", which states that everyone, even the Archdruid, can make mistakes. However, ADF was also a reaction to the Reformed Druids of North America, a freethinking religious group which Bonewits considered too loose and not Neopagan enough. Beliefs ADF promotes a neo-druidism in which worshipers perform rituals honoring three kinds of entities: gods and goddesses, ancestors (honored dead), and nature spirits. Examples of gods and goddesses worshipped include Lugh, Cernunnos, the Morrigan, Thor, Freya, Apollo, Athena, Vesta, Ceres, and many other ancient, pre-Christian, Indo-European deities. Although various pantheons or \\"hearth cultures\\" are allowed, \\"mixing and matching\\" unrelated deities within a single rite is discouraged. Ancestors usually refers to the direct blood ancestors of the worshiper, but can include other honored dead (friends, mythological heroes, etc.), too. Nature spirits includes general animal (totem) spirits as well as whatever spirits are present in the place of worship, such as a local river spirit. Most ADF rituals occur outdoors. In ADF terms, the triad of deities, ancestors, and nature spirits is called the \\"Three Kindreds\\". There are other triads in ADF practice, such as the \\"three realms\\" of the Underworld (associated with the ancestors), the Heavens (associated with the gods), and this world (associated with the nature spirits); these are similar to the three worlds of the Celts, and to the Norse realms of Niflheim, Asgard, and Midgard. There are also three parts to this world; the Land, the Sea (including saltwater and freshwater bodies), and the Sky. All of these triads are based on the common and pervasive theme of \\"threes\\" attributed to ancient Indo-European (and particularly Celtic) cultures. Similarly, ADF uses the common Indo-European themes of a sacred tree (e.g. the Norse Yggdrasil), a \\"gatekeeper\\" or opener of ways (e.g. the Norse god Heimdall, the Celtic god Manannan mac Lir, or the Hellenic god Hermes), and a treaty with hostile entities (e.g. the Norse Jotuns or the Celtic Fomorians). In these ways, ADF practice is an attempt to reconstruct earlier Indo-European beliefs and practices by using the records we have of ancient Indo-European cultures, and looking for commonalities among them which can then be applied to current spiritual practice. ADF practice straddles the difficult middle ground between pure reconstructionism (attempting to recreate ancient practices as exactly as possible) and a less exclusive form of Neopaganism (an umbrella term for the loose agglomeration of pagan-based religions which arose in the early to middle 20th century, the most popular of which is Wicca). Thus, it attempts to be as authentic as possible given the realities of modern life. For example, ADF forbids any form of blood sacrifice in its official rituals, because even if it were appropriate in relation to one's ancestors (who may have lived in agrarian societies that regularly killed their own food), it is not considered appropriate in modern society. Organization Local ADF congregations are known as \\"groves\\" (like groves of trees), and while group rituals are often regarded as more powerful than rituals performed individually, In 2017 there were about 70 groves worldwide. ADF also has many solitary members; some by choice, and some because there are no groves within easy traveling distance. There are also ADF \\"protogroves\\", which are usually one or two people who would like to start a bigger grove. By forming a protogrove, they are able to appear on the list of ADF groves in the organization's online and printed literature, and so attract potential new members. One of ADF's cornerstone principles is the notion that it is a public form of Neopaganism. Again, this was partly a reaction to the secretive religious groups Isaac was familiar with, such as closed covens which were limited in size to 13 members, or Masonic-style societies. In addition to promoting cult-ish behavior, such secretism in a larger sense was seen as unnecessarily promulgating the \\"underground\\" (occult, hidden) nature of Neopaganism. By making ADF a public tradition, its founder hoped to both prevent ADF from ever becoming a cult, and to further Neopaganism's acceptance in broader society as a credible and sane family of religions. As a result of these principles and intents, ADF groves are required to have open-to-the- public rituals on or near the eight \\"High Days\\" of the common Neopagan calendar such as Bealtaine, Lughnasadh, and Samhain (the holidays of the Wheel of the Year). Such rituals follow an established \\"core order of ritual\\" and are expected to focus on one particular pantheon or \\"hearth culture\\" for that high day. ADF groves are also required to perform some kind of public service on a quarterly basis (cleaning up parks and other ecological activities are popular). An annual meeting of ADF is held at an event selected by the membership. Thus far it has been at either the Starwood Festival or the Wellspring Gathering, presently held at Tredara in Madison, OH on Memorial Day Weekend and at Brushwood Folklore Center in the past. This meeting originated as part of the Starwood Festival in 1987 at Bear Creek KOA in East Sparta, OH, and was held at Starwood through 1992. Wellspring, run by Stone Creed Grove, became a separate event in 1991, and the National Members Meeting was moved to Wellspring in 1993. ADF still maintains a presence at the Starwood Festival, holding meetings and offering classes and rituals, and sometimes has more members attending there than at the Wellspring Gathering. Anyone may join ADF, as membership is open to the public. Archdruids *1984‚Äì1996: Phillip Emmons Isaac Bonewits (Founder; Emeritus) (b. 1949 ‚Äì d. 2010) *1996: Ian Corrigan (Jeffrey L.

The original Maraba Village, situated just to the south of the present Marabastad, was founded and ruled by the Ndebele Chief Maraba. The name Marabastad is the Afrikaans word meaning Maraba Village.  Background  Marabastad was a culturally diverse community, with the Hindu Mariamman Temple arguably being its most prominent landmark. Like the residents of other racially diverse areas in South Africa, such as District Six, \\"Fietas\\" and Sophiatown, the inhabitants of Marabastad were relocated to single-race townships further away from the city centre. These removals were due to Apartheid laws like the Group Areas Act. Unlike Sophiatown, Fietas and District Six, it was not bulldozed, but it retained many of its original buildings, and became primarily a business district, with most shops still owned by the Indians who had also lived there previously. Some property was however owned by the city council and the government, resulting in limited development taking place there. In addition, a large shopping complex was built to house Indian-owned shops. The black residents of Marabastad were relocated to Atteridgeville (1945), the Coloured residents to Eersterus (1963), and the Indian residents to Laudium (1968). There are plans to revive once-picturesque Marabastad, and to reverse years of urban decay and neglect, although few seem to have been implemented as of 2005.  History  Marabastad was named after the local headman of a village to the west of Steenhoven Spruit. During the 1880s he lived in Schoolplaats and acted as an interpreter. During this period some Africans lived on the farms where they were being employed and also chose to live on other, undeveloped land. Schoolplaats could also not accommodate all the migrants and this resulted in squatting. An overflow from Schoolplaats to the north-west and Maraba's village occurred and in August 1888 the land was surveyed by the government. The location Marabastad was established and was situated between the Apies River in the north, Skinner Spruit in the west, Steenhoven Spruit in the east and De Korte Street in the south. There were 67 stands varying between 1400 and 2500 square meters each. Residents were not allowed to own stands, but had to rent them from the government at 4 pounds a year. They were allowed to build their own houses and to plant crops on empty plots. Water was acquired from the various bordering rivers and 58 wells situated in the area. The township was not private owned and was managed by the Transvaal Boer Republic. At the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899 there were no rules and regulations with regard to Marabastad. Africans who streamed to Pretoria during the war were living in squatter camps near the artillery barracks, the brickworks and the railway stations at Prinshof. This resulted in the development of ‚ÄòNew Marabastad‚Äô in the area between Marabastad and the Asiatic Bazaar in 1900 by the British military authorities. They had been occupying the city since June 1900 and resettled refugees in the area. By 1901 there were 392 occupied stands in the New Marabastad and there was no real segregation between Africans, Asians and Coloured people. Although New Marabastad was intended as a temporary settlement the military authorities granted permission for in their employ to erect brick houses. This resulted in the erection of other permanent structures like schools and churches. The new Town Council was established in 1902 and it was accepted that the residents of New Marabastad would be moved to other, planned townships. In 1903 New Marabastad had grown to 412 stands while Old Marabastad still only had 67. Along with the Cape Location, which was situated in the southern part of the Asiatic Bazaar, it fell under the jurisdiction of the City Council of that year. The greatest problem was the provision of water and this was only addressed after the war. Due to the fear of epidemic all wells in the area had been filled during the war, and a single public tap had replaced the entire system. New Marabastad didn't have any wells or taps. There was an attempt to rectify this in 1903 by providing more taps, but the number was still inadequate. In 1906 New and Old Marabastad became one location. Rates were determined and sanitary and building regulations came into effect. These regulations didn't achieve their objections as a result of municipal maladministration and the fact that Africans could not own land and afford well-built permanent houses. Streets remained unpaved, the water supply was inadequate and there were no sanitary facilities worth mentioning. More and more shacks appeared. By 1907 conditions improved marginally, but the streets were left in their unkempt state and by 1910 this had still not been addressed. The Native Affairs Department accused the Pretoria Town Council of inefficient administration, which had led directly to this situation.  Removals  The relocation of residents of Old Marabastad had been on the agenda of the town council since 1903 and in 1907, when the council decided to build a new sewage farm, it became a reality. It was decided to remove all residents of the area to a new location further away from the city centre and to demolish the old township. Now followed the struggle of finding a suitable site. The site on the southern slope of Daspoortrand was decided on in 1912 and in January planning for the ‚ÄòNew Location‚Äô started. It would include a number of brick houses that could be rented from the municipality. By September of the same year the first relocations were taking place and demolishing of old structures commenced. It was a slow process and Old Marabastad was only completely destroyed by 1920. The lack of space remained a problem and New Marabastad was experiencing severe overcrowding. By 1923 the last houses of the second municipal project was completed in New Location and Marabastad residents who had been exposed to the worst conditions were allowed to move in first. In 1934 part of the Schoolplaats population was moved to Marabastad and the squatter problem became more severe. There was no room for expansion due to a lack of space. An attempt to solve these problems manifested itself in the establishment of Atteridgeville in 1939. The Marabastad community would be moved here and compensation was offered to previous owners of property in the form of new houses they could rent, but not own. The war slowed the process considerably, but 1949 had moved three quarters of the population of Marabastad to Atteridgeville, and by 1950 the transition was complete.

He is the author of numerous books on crossing cultures including Video Night in Kathmandu, The Lady and the Monk and The Global Soul. He has been a contributor to Time, Harper's, The New York Review of Books, and The New York Times. Early life Iyer was born Siddharth Pico Raghavan Iyer in Oxford, England, the son of Indian parents. His father was Raghavan N. Iyer, an philosopher and political theorist then enrolled in doctoral studies at the University of Oxford.\\"Raghavan Iyer, Political Science: Santa Barbara, 1930-1995\\", Calisphere, University of California.Rukun Advani, \\"Mahatma for Sale\\", The Hindu, 27 April 2003. His mother is the religious scholar Nandini Nanak Mehta. He is the great-great-grandson of Indian Gujarati writer Mahipatram Nilkanth. Both of his parents grew up in India then went to England for tertiary education. His name is a combination of the Buddha's name, Siddhartha and that of the Italian Renaissance philosopher Pico della Mirandola. When Iyer was seven, in 1964, his family moved to California, when his father started working with the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions, a California-based think tank, and started teaching at University of California, Santa Barbara. For over a decade, Iyer moved between schools and college in England and his parents' home in California. He was a King's Scholar at Eton College, was awarded a congratulatory double first in English literature at Magdalen College, Oxford in 1978, and then received an A.M. in literature from Harvard University in 1980. He received the Oxbridge M.A. in 1982. In 2017, along with Pl√°cido Domingo and Mario Vargas Llosa, he was awarded an honorary doctorate (in Humane Letters) by Chapman University. Career Iyer taught writing and literature at Harvard before joining Time in 1982 as a writer on world affairs. Since then he has travelled widely, from North Korea to Easter Island, and from Paraguay to Ethiopia, while writing works of non-fiction and two novels, including Video Night in Kathmandu (1988), The Lady and the Monk (1991), The Global Soul (2000) and The Man Within My Head (2012).

He was also the first writer- in-residence at Raffles Hotel Singapore, where he released his book This Could be Home (2019), which explores Singapore's heritage through its landmarks.  Writing themes  Iyer's writings build on his growing up in a combination of English, American, and Indian cultures. Travel is a key theme in most of his works. In one of his works, The Global Soul (2000) he takes on the international airport as a central subject, along with associated jet lag, displacement and cultural mingling. As a travel writer, he often writes of living between the cracks and outside fixed categories. Many of his books have been about trying to see from within some society or way of life, but from an outsider's perspective. He has filed stories from Bhutan, Nepal, Ethiopia, Cuba, Argentina, Japan, and North Korea Some of the topics that he explores in his works include revolution in Cuba, Sufism, Buddhist Kyoto, and global disorientation. In his own words from a 1993 article in Harper's, \\"I am a multinational soul on a multinational globe on which more and more countries are as polyglot and restless as airports. Taking planes seems as natural to me as picking up the phone or going to school; I fold up my self and carry it around as if it were an overnight bag.\\"April 1993 issue of Harper's. His writing alternating between the monastery and the airport, the Indian writer Pradeep Sebastian writes about Iyer, as \\"Thomas Merton on a frequent flier pass aiming to bring new global energies and possibilities into non- fiction\\".The Hindu, 7 November 2006.

Life Mor√©ri was born in 1643 in Bargemon, a village in the ancient province of Provence. His great-grandfather, Joseph Chatranet, a native of Dijon, had settled in Provence under King Charles IX of France and taken the name of the village of Mor√©ri, which he acquired through marriage.Arnold Miller, \\"Louis Mor√©ri's Grand Dictionnaire historique,\\" in Notable Encyclopedias of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries: Nine Predecessors of the Encyclop√©die, ed. Frank A. Kafker (Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 1981), 17. Louis Mor√©ri studied humanities in Draguignan and later rhetoric and philosophy at the Jesuit College of Aix-en-Provence. He then studied theology, obtaining his doctoral degree, and was ordained a priest in Lyon. During his stay in Lyon, he published several works, among them La pratique de la perfection chr√©tienne et religieuse (1667), a translation of the work of the Spanish Jesuit theologian, Alonso Rodriguez. It was probably in Lyon that he met Samuel Chappuzeau, who claimed to have first given him the idea of writing his encyclopedia.Chappuzeau worked in Lyon for a time. For his claim of priority, see J. Caullery, \\"Notes sur Samuel Chappuzeau,\\" Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© de l'histoire du protestantisme fran√ßais 58 (1909): 145. In 1675, shortly after publishing the first edition of his encyclopedia, Mor√©ri accompanied his bishop to Paris, where he became acquainted with Simon Arnauld, Marquis de Pomponne, then the minister of foreign affairs. Three years later, he was hired to be a tutor for Pomponne's children. During this time, he worked on a second edition of his encyclopedia. In 1680, midway through the printing of the second edition, he died of tuberculosis.Miller, \\"Louis Mor√©ri's Grand Dictionnaire historique,\\" 18. Legacy Le grand dictionaire historique Mor√©ri's encyclopedia, Le Grand Dictionaire historique, ou le m√©lange curieux de l'histoire sacr√©e et profane (literally, The Great Historical Dictionary, or Curious Anthology of Sacred and Secular History, although it was translated differently into English at the time) was first published in Lyon in 1674. The encyclopedia focused almost exclusively on historical and biographical articles. Mor√©ri dedicated it to Gaillard de Longjumeau, the Bishop of Apt, to whom he had been appointed chaplain. Mor√©ri's one-volume edition of 1674 and posthumous two-volume edition of 1681 were revised and expanded by others after his death. At least twenty-four editions were published between 1674 (one volume) and 1759 (ten volumes). The encyclopedia was also translated and adapted into English, German, Dutch and Spanish.Miller, \\"Louis Mor√©ri's Grand Dictionnaire historique,\\" 48-50. Mor√©ri's Grand Dictionaire historique gave rise to a more famous encyclopedia, Pierre Bayle's The Historical and Critical Dictionary (1697). Bayle conceived his work as correcting and making up for deficiencies of Mor√©ri's work.

Shakespeare's two narrative poems, Venus and Adonis and The Rape of Lucrece, were dedicated to Southampton, who is frequently identified as the Fair Youth of Shakespeare's Sonnets. Family Henry Wriothesley, born 6 October 1573 at Cowdray House, Sussex, was the only son of Henry Wriothesley, 2nd Earl of Southampton, by Mary Browne, the only daughter of Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montague, and his first wife, Jane Radcliffe.. He had two sisters, Jane, who died before 1573, and Mary (c. 1567 ‚Äì 1607), who in June 1585 married Thomas Arundell, 1st Baron Arundell of Wardour.; ; ;. After his father's death, Southampton's mother married firstly, on 2 May 1594, as his second wife, Sir Thomas Heneage (d. 17 October 1595), Vice-Chamberlain of the Household, and secondly, between 5 November 1598 and 31 January 1599, Sir William Hervey. She died in November 1607.; ; . Early life When his father died on 4 October 1581 Southampton inherited the earldom and landed income valued at ¬£1097 6s per annum. His wardship and marriage were sold by the Queen to her kinsman, Charles, Lord Howard of Effingham, for ¬£1000. According to Akrigg, Howard then \\"entered into some further agreement, of which no documentation can now be found, which transferred to Lord Burghley personally the custody and marriage of the young Earl, but left Howard holding his lands\\", and late in 1581 or early in 1582 Southampton, then eight years of age, came to live at Cecil House in the Strand.. In October 1585, at age twelve, Southampton entered St John's College, Cambridge,Cokayne states that he matriculated 11 December 1585. graduating M.A. on 6 June 1589.; ; . His name was entered at the Gray's Inn legal society before he left the university, and he was admitted on 29 February 1588.; . On Southampton's 16th birthday, 6 October 1589, Lord Burghley noted Southampton's age in his diary, and by 1590 Burghley was negotiating with Southampton's grandfather, Anthony Browne, 1st Viscount Montague, and Southampton's mother, Mary, for a marriage between Southampton and Lord Burghley's eldest granddaughter, Elizabeth Vere, daughter of Burghley's daughter, Anne Cecil, and Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. However the match was not to Southampton's liking, and in a letter written in November 1594, about six weeks after Southampton had turned 21, the Jesuit Henry Garnet reported the rumour that \\"The young Erle of Southampton refusing the Lady Veere payeth ¬£5000 of present payment\\".; . In 1591 Lord Burghley's Clerk in Chancery, John Clapham, dedicated to Southampton a poem in Latin, Narcissus, recounting the Greek legend of a beautiful young man who perishes through self-love. According to Akrigg, Southampton was now spending much of his time at court. He was in attendance when Queen Elizabeth visited Oxford in late September 1592, and was praised in the Latin poem written by John Sandford to commemorate the Queen's visit.Robert Giroux, The Book Known As Q: A Consideration of Shakespeare's Sonnets, Atheneum, 1982, p. 80 In October 1592 Southampton's grandfather, Viscount Montague, died. Montague had been a Knight of the Garter, and on 3 May 1593 Philip Gawdy of Clifford's Inn (a law school and Inn of Chancery) wrote to his brother, Bassingbourne Gawdy, that Southampton had been nominated to the Order, together with the Lord Keeper, Lord Burgh, and Lord Willoughby de Eresby. Shortly thereafter, in his Honour of the Garter dated 26 June 1593, George Peele referred to him as \\"Gentle Wriothesley, Southampton's star\\", claiming erroneously that an Earl of Southampton had been among the founding Knights.; ; ; . However it was not until 1603 that Southampton was invested in the Order under King James. Southampton and Shakespeare Henry Wriothesley at 21 Shakespeare's dedication to Southampton of The Rape of Lucrece, 1594 In 1593 Shakespeare dedicated his narrative poem Venus and Adonis to Southampton, followed in 1594 by The Rape of Lucrece. Although the dedication to Venus and Adonis is more restrained, the dedication to The Rape of Lucrece is couched in extravagant terms: > The love I dedicate to your lordship is without end ... What I have done is > yours; what I have to do is yours; being part in all I have, devoted yours. This type of vaunting language was not particularly unusual however, because other dedications of the day always excessively praised any noble person sponsoring the author's work ‚Äì mainly for political and, above all, financial reasons. Nathan Drake, in Shakespeare and his Times, was the first to suggest that Southampton was not only the dedicatee of Shakespeare's two long narrative poems, but also the \\"Fair Youth\\" of the Sonnets.. The title page refers to the \\"onlie begetter of these sonnets Mr W.H.,\\" and it had earlier been inferred that the Sonnets were addressed to \\"Mr. W.H.\\". Drake, however, adopting Chalmers' suggestion that one meaning of \\"beget\\" is \\"bring forth\\", argued that Mr. W.H. was merely the procurer of the manuscript rather than the \\"Fair Youth\\" addressed in the poems.. Other adherents of the theory that Southampton was the addressee of the Sonnets have suggested that his initials, H.W. (Henry Wriothesley), were simply reversed by the publisher to conceal his identity. However, Honan argues that although Southampton > may be involved in Shakespeare's sonnets ... there is no real likelihood > that he traduced him by drawing his portrait as the fickle, treacherous > Young Man of the sonnets, who is implicitly \\"lascivious\\" (sonnet 95), > \\"sensual\\" to a \\"fault\\" or to his \\"shame\\" (sonnets 34, 35), and ridden with > vices. Despite extensive archival research, no documents have been found concerning their relationship apart from the dedications to Shakespeare's two long narrative poems. Nicholas Rowe, on the authority of poet and playwright William Davenant (1606 ‚Äì 7 April 1668), stated in his Life of Shakespeare that Southampton once gave Shakespeare ¬£1,000 to \\"go through with a purchase,\\" but Honan terms this a myth. The 1590s Southampton received dedications from other writers in the 1590s. On 27 June 1593 Thomas Nashe completed his picaresque novel, The Unfortunate Traveller, and dedicated it to Southampton,The dedication was withdrawn from the second edition. terming him \\"a dere lover and cherisher ... as well of the lovers of Poets, as of Poets themselves\\",; . and in 1593 Barnabe Barnes published Parthenophil and Parthenope with a dedicatory sonnet to Southampton.. In 1595 Gervase Markham included a dedicatory sonnet to Southampton in The Most Honorable Tragedy of Richard Grinvile, Knight.. On 2 March 1596 John Florio's Italian/English dictionary was entered in the Stationers' Register.It was not published until 1598. In his dedication, Florio, who was for some years in the Earl's \\"pay and patronage\\", complimented Southampton on his fluency in Italian, saying he \\"had become so complete a master of Italian as to have no need of travel abroad to perfect his mastery of that tongue\\".. In 1597 Henry Lok included a sonnet to Southampton among the sixty dedicatory sonnets in his Sundry Christian Passions.. In the same year William Burton dedicated to him a translation of Achilles Tatius's, Clitophon and Leucippe.. On 4 October 1594 Southampton's friend, Sir Henry Danvers, shot Henry Long, brother of Sir Walter Long, in the course of a local feud between the Danvers and Long families. Sir Henry and his elder brother, Sir Charles Danvers, fled to Titchfield, where Southampton sheltered them. The brothers were outlawed, and eventually escaped to the continent where they took refuge at the court of King Henri IV.. On 17 November 1595, Southampton jousted in Queen Elizabeth's accession day tournament, earning a mention in George Peele's Anglorum Feriae as \\"gentle and debonaire\\". However, according to Akrigg, \\"Gentle and debonair he may have been, but we never again hear of Southampton being high in the graces of Queen Elizabeth\\".. On 13 April 1596 the Queen specifically instructed Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, not to take either Southampton or the Earl of Derby,According to Akrigg, Southampton and Derby were \\"rather close friends at this period\\"; . with him on an expedition for the Relief of Calais, and it also appears that Southampton did not accompany Essex on the Cadiz Expedition that summer.; Honan states that Southampton did go with Essex to Cadiz; . In February 1597 Southampton challenged the Earl of Northumberland to a duel with rapiers, requiring intervention by the Queen and Privy Council, and on 1 March stood godfather at the christening of Sir Robert Sidney's daughter, Bridget. Later that year Southampton was with Essex on his \\"inglorious\\" Voyage to the Azores, where according to Rowland Whyte, \\"My Lord of Southampton fought with one of the Kings great Men of Warre, and suncke her\\". On his return he made his first appearance in the House of Lords on 5 November, and was put on several committees, but became a \\"chronic absentee\\". By this time he was in serious financial difficulties, and had turned over administration of his estates to two trustees, who by the end of the year had sold some of his lands.. In 1598 Southampton was involved in a brawl at court with Ambrose Willoughby,Ambrose Willoughby, second son of Charles Willoughby, 2nd Baron Willoughby of Parham, is also mentioned in a letter of 17 June 1602 from John Chamberlain to Sir Dudley Carleton: \\"Gray Bridges hath hurt Ambrose Willoughby in the heade and body, for abusing his father and himself at a conference of arbiterment twixt them and Mistris Bridges\\"; . one of the Queen's esquires of the body, who had ordered him to leave the presence chamber where he was playing at primero after the Queen had retired for the evening. Southampton struck Willoughby, and \\"Willoughby puld of some of his locke\\", for which the Queen gave Willoughby thanks, saying \\"he had done better yf he had sent hym to the porters lodge, to see who durst have fetcht hym out\\".; . There is a suggestion that underlying the altercation was something Willoughby had said which caused trouble between Southampton and his mistress, Elizabeth Vernon, one of the Queen's Maids of Honour. The Queen forbade Southampton to present himself at court, although he was soon allowed back. Nonetheless it was reported by Rowland Whyte at the beginning of February that \\"My Lord of Southampton is much troubled at her Majesties straungest Usage of hym\\". Faced with his financial difficulties and the Queen's disfavour, Southampton determined to live abroad for a time, and seized the opportunity of accompanying Sir Robert Cecil on an embassy to Henri IV of France. On 6 February Southampton was granted licence to travel abroad for two years, and by March he and Cecil were in Angers, where on 7 March Southampton was presented to the French King.. When Cecil returned to England from his failed mission in April, Southampton remained at the French court, planning to travel to Italy with Sir Charles Danvers and Sir Henry Danvers, whom he had helped to escape from England in 1594 after the murder of Henry Long. At that juncture the Queen decided to pardon the Danvers brothers, and they were back in England on 30 August 1598, at which time Southampton also returned in secret, and married his pregnant mistress, Elizabeth Vernon. He left for the continent almost immediately, but by 3 September the Queen had learned of the marriage and consigned Elizabeth Vernon, one of her chief ladies-in-waiting, to the Fleet Prison for marrying without royal permission. The Queen ordered Southampton to return to England forthwith, but he remained in Paris for two months, losing large sums in gambling. By the beginning of November he was back in England, also lodged in the Fleet, where he remained for a month, during which time Elizabeth Vernon gave birth to a daughter, Penelope. To add to his difficulties, Southampton was at this time involved in a dispute with his mother, the Dowager Countess, over her prospective marriage to Sir William Hervey. Lord Henry Howard was brought in to smooth matters between mother and son, and the Countess and Hervey were wed in early January 1599.. In 1599, during the Nine Years War (1595‚Äì1603), Southampton went to Ireland with Essex, who made him General of the Horse, but the Queen insisted that the appointment be cancelled. Southampton remained on in personal attendance upon the Earl, rather than as an officer. However, Southampton was active during the campaign and prevented a defeat at the hands of the Irish rebels when his cavalry drove off an attack at Arklow in County Wicklow. Shortly after the Essex's Rebellion in February 1601, William Reynolds, a soldier who had served with Essex in Ireland in 1599, mentioned Southampton in a letter to Sir Robert Cecil. Speaking of certain men involved in the Essex rebellion who had not yet been arrested, Reynolds wrote:; ; . > I do mervell also what becam of pearse edmones, the earle of Essex man, > borne in strand neare me, and which has had many rewards & preferments by > the earle essex, his villany I have often complained of, he dweles in > London, he was corporall generall of the horse in Ierland under the earle of > Sowthamton, he eate & drank at his table and lay in his tente, the earle of > Sowthamton gave him a horse, which edmones refused a 100 markes for him, the > earle Sowthamton would cole and huge him in his armes and play wantonly with > him. This pearse began to fawne and flatter me in Ierland offering me great > curtesie, telling me what pay grases & giftes they earles bestowed uppon > him, therby seming to move and anymate me to desiar and looke for the like > favour, But I coeld never love & afecte them to make them my frends, > esspecially essex whoes mynd I ever mistrusted.... According to Duncan-Jones, Reynolds' letter hints that 'rewards could be obtained from either or both of the two Earls in return for sexual favours'. On the other hand, Duncan-Jones concludes that Reynolds may have been a paranoid schizophrenic, and that by his own statement he had written over 200 letters to the Queen, Privy Council, and members of the clergy wherein he had \\"complaynid of al the abewses and vilent oppresseones & sodometicall sines over flowing this land\\".. On his return from Ireland, Southampton attracted notice as a playgoer. \\"My Lord Southampton and Lord Rutland,\\" wrote Rowland Whyte to Sir Robert Sydney in 1599, \\"come not to the court: the one doth but very seldom. They pass away the time in London merely in going to plays every day\\".; . Southampton was deeply involved in the Essex's Rebellion of 1601, and in February of that year he was sentenced to death. Cecil, who urged the Queen to show the greatest possible degree of clemency, obtained the commutation of his penalty to life imprisonment. Life under King James Southampton c. 1600 Southampton On the accession of James I Southampton resumed his place at court and received numerous honours from the new king. On the eve of the abortive rebellion of Essex he had induced the players at the Globe Theatre to revive Richard II, and on his release from prison in 1603 he resumed his connection with the stage. In January 1605 he entertained Queen Anne with a performance of Love's Labour's Lost by Burbage and his company, to which Shakespeare belonged, at Southampton House.HMC: Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House, vol. 16, p. 415, letter of Walter Cope to Robert Cecil about Burbage. He seems to have been a born fighter, and engaged in more than one serious quarrel at court, being imprisoned for a short time in 1603 following a heated argument with Lord Grey of Wilton in front of Queen Anne. Grey, an implacable opponent of the Essex faction, was later implicated in the Main Plot and Bye Plot. Southampton was in more serious disgrace in 1621 for his determined opposition to Buckingham. He was a volunteer on the Protestant side in Germany in 1614, and in 1617 he proposed to fit out an expedition against the Barbary pirates. Southampton was a leader among the Jacobean aristocrats who turned to modern investment practices\\"in industry, in modernizing their estates and in overseas trade and colonization.\\"Margot Heinemann, \\"Rebel Lords, Popular Playwrights, and Political Culture: Notes on the Jacobean Patronage of the Earl of Southampton,\\" in Brown; p. 139. He financed the first tinplate mill in the country, and founded an ironworks at Titchfield. He developed his properties in London, in Bloomsbury and Holborn; he revamped his country estates, participated in the efforts of the East India Company and the New England Company, and backed Henry Hudson's search for the Northwest Passage. A significant artistic patron in the Jacobean as well as the Elizabethan era, Southampton promoted the work of George Chapman, Samuel Daniel, Thomas Heywood, and the composer Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger. Heywood's popular, expansionist dramas were compatible with Southampton's maritime and colonial interests.Consider Heywood's The Fair Maid of the West, Fortune by Land and Sea, and The Travels of the Three English Brothers; Heinemann, pp. 142‚Äì47. Virginia Company The Earl of Southampton c.1618, after a portrait by Daniel Mytens, National Portrait Gallery, London. Henry Wriothesley, whose name is included in the 1605 panel of the New World Tapestry, took a considerable share in promoting the colonial enterprises of the time, and was an active member of the Virginia Company's governing council. Although profits proved elusive, his other visions for the Colony based at Jamestown were eventually accomplished. He was part of a faction within the company with Sir Edwin Sandys, who eventually became the Treasurer, and worked tirelessly to support the struggling venture. In addition to profits, Southampton's faction sought a permanent colony which would enlarge British territory, relieve the nation's overpopulation, and expand the market for English goods. Although profits largely eluded the Virginia Company, and it was dissolved in 1624, the other goals were accomplished. His name is thought by many to be the origin of the naming of the harbour of Hampton Roads, and the Hampton River. Although named at later dates, similar attribution may involve the town (and later city) of Hampton, Virginia, as well as Southampton County, Virginia and Northampton County. However, the name Southampton was not uncommon in England, including an important port city and an entire region along the southern coast, which was originally part of Hampshire. There are also variations applied in other areas of the English colonies which were not part of the Virginia Company of London's efforts, making the origin of the word and derivations of it as applied in Virginia even more debatable. Later life and death In 1624, Southampton was one of four Englishmen appointed to command troops fighting in the Low Countries against the Spanish. Shortly after their arrival, the earl's eldest son, James Wriothesley, succumbed to a fever at Rosendael. Five days later, on 10 November 1624, Southampton died of the same cause at Bergen-op-Zoom, aged 51\\\\. Both were buried in the parish church of Titchfield, Hampshire. Marriage and issue Elizabeth, Countess of Southampton c. 1618 In August 1598, Southampton secretly married Elizabeth Vernon, the daughter of John Vernon of Hodnet, Shropshire, by his wife Elizabeth Devereux. Elizabeth Devereux's grandfathers were the Viscount Hereford and the Earl of Huntingdon; on her father John's side, Elizabeth's family were more obscure. When Elizabeth was pregnant she wrote to her husband asking him to buy her a stomacher of scarlet cloth lined with plush to keep her warm while riding, and bring his portrait 'very finely done'.HMC Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury, vol. 15 (London, 1930), pp. 203-4. They had several children, including: *Penelope Wriothesley, who married William Spencer, 2nd Baron Spencer of Wormleighton. *James Wriothesley, Lord Wriothesley (1 March 1605 - 5 November 1624), who died five days before his father, of the same illness. *Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton (10 March 1607 - 16 May 1667). *Anne Wriothesley, who married Robert Wallop (20 July 1601 - 19 November 1667) of Farley Wallop. Portraits There exist numerous portraits of Southampton, in which he is depicted with dark auburn hair and blue eyes, compatible with Shakespeare's description of \\"a man right fair.\\" Sir John Beaumont wrote a well-known elegy in his praise, and Gervase Markham wrote of him in a tract entitled Honor in his Perfection, or a Treatise in Commendation of ... Henry, Earl of Oxenford, Henry, Earle of Southampton, Robert, Earl of Essex (1624). In 2002, a portrait in the Cobbe collection was identified as a portrait of the youthful Earl. Showing him as an androgynous-looking young man, it is now known as the Cobbe portrait of Southampton. In April 2008, a further portrait believed to be of Southampton, hidden beneath a portrait of his wife Elizabeth Vernon, was discovered when the work was X-rayed in preparation for an exhibition. In popular culture The Earl has been played on screen by several different actors: *Peter Egan in the BBC mini-series Elizabeth R, 1971. *Nicholas Clay in the TV series Life of Shakespeare, 1978. *Eddie Redmayne in the Channel 4 mini-series Elizabeth I, 2005. *Shaun Evans in the mini-series The Virgin Queen, 2006. *Xavier Samuel in the feature film Anonymous, 2011. *Adam Harley in the sitcom Upstart Crow, 2016. *Ian McKellen in the feature film All Is True, 2018.

It was created in 1822 for Richard Temple-Nugent- Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 2nd Marquess of Buckingham, who was created Marquess of Chandos and Duke of Buckingham and Chandos at the same time. In contrast to the Marquessate and Dukedom, which were created with remainder to the heirs male of his body only, the Earldom was created with remainder to (1) the heirs male of his body, failing which to (2) the heirs male of his deceased great-grandmother the 1st Countess Temple, failing which to (3) his granddaughter Lady Anna Grenville (daughter of Richard, Earl Temple, later 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos) and the heirs male of her body, and then to possible younger daughters of Lord Temple and the heirs male of their bodies (there were, in the event, no other daughters). The Earldom remained merged with the Dukedom until the death of the 1st Duke's grandson the 3rd Duke, when the Dukedom and four of its subsidiary titles became extinct (the Viscountcy and Barony of Cobham and the Lordship of Kinloss survived, however; see these titles for more information). The late Duke was succeeded in the Earldom of Temple of Stowe according to the special remainder by his nephew William Gore- Langton. He was the eldest son of the aforementioned Lady Anna Grenville and her husband William Gore-Langton. The latter was a descendant of Sir John Gore, Lord Mayor of London in 1624, whose elder brother Sir Paul Gore, 1st Baronet, was the ancestor of the Earls of Arran (1762 creation), the Barons Annaly (1766 and 1789 creations) and the Barons Harlech. The 4th Earl Temple of Stowe had previously represented Mid Somerset in Parliament as a Conservative. In 1892 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Temple. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the 5th Earl. He died childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the 6th Earl. He was the eldest son of Captain the Hon. Chandos Temple-Gore-Langton, second son of the 4th Earl. Chandos had two daughters. On his death the title passed to his younger brother, the 7th Earl. He was a travelling salesman in Australia and did not use the title. He never married and was succeeded by his cousin, the 8th Earl. He was the son of the Hon. Evelyn Arthur Grenville Temple-Gore-Langton, third and youngest son of the fourth Earl. Upon his death in 2013, he was succeeded by his son James. Lord Temple of Stowe is also in remainder to the Lordship of Kinloss. There are no subsidiary titles held by the Earl. Consequently, the eldest son and heir of the Earl uses the invented title Lord Langton as a courtesy title. The family seat from which the title derives was Stowe House in Buckinghamshire.

It was created on 10 September 1831 for Arthur Chichester, Member of Parliament for Milborne Port and County Wexford. He was the son of Lord Spencer Stanley Chichester, third son of The 1st Marquess of Donegall (see Marquess of Donegall for earlier history of the Chichester family). Lord Templemore's son, the second Baron, and grandson, the third Baron, both served as Deputy Lieutenants of County Wexford. The latter was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Baron. He served as the Government Chief Whip in the House of Lords between 1940 and 1945. He was succeeded by his second but eldest surviving son, the fifth Baron. In 1975 he succeeded his kinsman as seventh Marquess of Donegall. For further history of the titles, see Marquess of Donegall. Two other members of this branch of the Chichester family may also be mentioned. The Honourable Augustus George Charles Chichester (1822-1896), second son of the first Baron, was a Lieutenant- General in the 77th Foot. The Honourable Sir Gerald Henry Crofton Chichester (1886-1939), second son of the third Baron, was private secretary to Queen Mary between 1935 and 1939. Despite the geographical designation \\"Templemore in the County of Donegal\\", in 1831 the civil parish of Templemore was entirely in County Londonderry rather than in neighbouring County Donegal. The name \\"Templemore\\" originally designated the medieval cathedral of Derry, and later the parish west of the River Foyle served by the cathedral. A 1613 charter included the portion of the parish nearest the renamed city of Londonderry within the city's northwest liberties and the new County Londonderry. Subsequently the County Donegal portion of Templemore was made into separate parishes (Muff, Burt, and Inch).

In background: Arctic Silver thermal paste remover. Silicone thermal compound Metal (silver) thermal compound Metal thermal paste applied to a chip Thermal paste is designed to fill surface imperfections on the surface of a chip Thermal paste (also called thermal compound, thermal grease, thermal interface material (TIM), thermal gel, heat paste, heat sink compound, heat sink paste or CPU grease) is a thermally conductive (but usually electrically insulating) chemical compound, which is commonly used as an interface between heat sinks and heat sources such as high-power semiconductor devices. The main role of thermal paste is to eliminate air gaps or spaces (which act as thermal insulation) from the interface area in order to maximize heat transfer and dissipation. Thermal paste is an example of a thermal interface material. As opposed to thermal adhesive, thermal paste does not add mechanical strength to the bond between heat source and heat sink. It has to be coupled with a mechanical fixation mechanism such as screws to hold the heat sink in place and to applying pressure, spreading the thermal paste.  Composition  Thermal paste consists of a polymerizable liquid matrix and large volume fractions of electrically insulating, but thermally conductive filler. Typical matrix materials are epoxies, silicones, urethanes, and acrylates; solvent- based systems, hot-melt adhesives, and pressure-sensitive adhesive tapes are also available. Aluminum oxide, boron nitride, zinc oxide, and increasingly aluminum nitride are used as fillers for these types of adhesives. The filler loading can be as high as 70‚Äì80% by mass, and raises the thermal conductivity of the base matrix from 0.17‚Äì0.3 W/(m¬∑K) (watts per meter-kelvin). up to about 4 W/(m¬∑K), according to a 2008 paper.. Silver thermal compounds may have a conductivity of 3 to 8 W/(m¬∑K) or more, and consist of micronized silver particles suspended in a silicone/ceramic medium. However, metal-based thermal paste can be electrically conductive and capacitive; if some flows onto the circuits, it can lead to malfunction and damage. The most effective (and most expensive) pastes consist almost entirely of liquid metal, usually a variation of the alloy galinstan, and have thermal conductivities in excess of 13 W/(m¬∑K). These are difficult to apply evenly and have the greatest risk of causing malfunction due to spillage. These pastes contain gallium, which is highly corrosive to aluminium and cannot be used on aluminium heat sinks. The lifespan of thermal paste varies depending on the manufacturer and typically ranges from 3 to 5 years.  Uses  Thermal paste is used to improve the heat coupling between different components. A common application is to drain away waste heat generated by electrical resistance in semiconductor devices including power transistors, CPUs, GPUs, and LED COBs. Cooling these devices is essential because excess heat rapidly degrades their performance and can cause a runaway to catastrophic failure of the device due to the negative temperature coefficient property of semiconductors. Factory PCs and laptops (though seldom tablets or smartphones) typically incorporate thermal paste between the top of the CPU case and a heat sink for cooling. Thermal paste is sometimes also used between the CPU die and its integrated heat spreader, though solder is sometimes used instead. When a CPU heat spreader is coupled to the die via thermal paste, performance enthusiasts such as overclockers are able to, in a process known as \\"delidding\\", pry the heat spreader (the CPU \\"lid\\") from the die, and replace the thermal paste, which is usually of low- quality, with a thermal paste having greater thermal conductivity. Generally, liquid metal thermal pastes are used in such instances.  Challenges  The consistency of thermal paste makes it susceptible to failure mechanisms distinct from some other thermal interface materials. A common one is pump- out, which is the loss of thermal paste from between the die and the heat sink due to their differing rates of thermal expansion and contraction. Over a large number of power cycles, thermal paste gets pumped out from between the die and the heat sink and eventually causes degradation of thermal performance. Another issue with some compounds is the separation of the polymer and filler matrix components occurs under high temperatures. The loss of polymeric material can result in poor wettability, leading to increased thermal resistance.

It is now held by members of the Leveson-Gower family.The family surname of Leveson-Gower is pronounced \\"Looson-Gore\\". First creation The first creation came in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1715 when Grace Carteret, Lady Carteret, was made Countess Granville and Viscountess Carteret. She was the daughter of John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath, and the widow of George Carteret, 1st Baron Carteret. The Carteret family descended from the celebrated royalist statesman George Carteret, who had been created a baronet, of Melesches, Jersey, in 1645. It was later intended that he should be elevated to the peerage but he died before the title could be granted. As his eldest son, Philip, predeceased him, the peerage was eventually bestowed on his namesake grandson, George, who was made Baron Carteret, of Hawnes in the County of Bedford, in 1681, with remainder to his brothers. Lord Carteret and Lady Granville were both succeeded by their son, the second Earl. He was a prominent statesman, mainly known under the title Lord Carteret. The titles became extinct in 1776 on the death of his son, the third Earl, without heirs. The Carteret estates were passed on to the late Earl's first cousin, the Hon. Henry Frederick Thynne, second son of Thomas Thynne, 2nd Viscount Weymouth, and his wife Lady Louisa Carteret, daughter of the second Earl Granville. He assumed the surname of Carteret and was created Baron Carteret in 1784. Second creation Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville, by Thomas Lawrence The second creation came in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1833 when the noted diplomat Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Viscount Granville, was made Earl Granville and Baron Leveson, of Stone Park in the County of Stafford. He had already been created Viscount Granville, of Stone Park in the County of Stafford, in 1815. Leveson- Gower was the son of Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Marquess of Stafford, by his third wife, Susanna. He was the younger half-brother of George Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Duke of Sutherland, and the uncle of Francis Egerton, 1st Earl of Ellesmere. He was also a great-great-nephew of the aforementioned Grace Carteret, 1st Countess Granville. Hence, the 1833 creation of the earldom of Granville was a revival of the title created in 1715. Lord Granville was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was a prominent Liberal politician and served three times as Foreign Secretary. His son, the third Earl, was also a diplomat and notably served as Ambassador to Belgium from 1928 to 1933. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He was a vice-admiral in the Royal Navy and also served as Governor of Northern Ireland from 1945 to 1952. Lord Granville married Lady Rose Constance Bowes-Lyon, second surviving daughter of Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, and elder sister of Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, wife of King George VI. , the titles are held by his grandson, the sixth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1996. The Hon. Frederick Leveson-Gower, younger son of the first Earl, was Member of Parliament for Derby, Stoke-upon-Trent and Bodmin. His son George Leveson-Gower was also a Member of Parliament.

He is recognised as the most important humanist in Renaissance England, he was also the first translator of Montaigne into English, the first translator of Boccaccio into English and he wrote the first comprehensive Dictionary in English and Italian (surpassing the only previous modest Italian‚ÄìEnglish dictionary by William Thomas published in 1550). John Florio contributed to the English language with 1,149 words, placing third after Chaucer (with 2,012 words) and Shakespeare (with 1,969 words), in the linguistic analysis conducted by Stanford professor John Willinsky. Empire of Words: The Reign of the OED, by John Willinsky, Princeton University Press, 1994 He has been proposed as the real author of Shakespeare's works. Proposed by Erik Reger in 1927, and advocated by Lamberto Tassinari in 2014, John Florio: The Man who was Shakespeare, Giano Books, 2009. Early life Born in London in 1553, John Florio was of Anglo-Italian origin. He referred to himself as \\"an Englishman in Italiane\\", a phrase which indicated, writes , that he was \\"an Englishman with an Italian inflection or streak\\".John Florio, Florio's Second Frutes (London, 1591), 'To the Reader', sig. *r. John's father, Michelangelo Florio, born in Tuscany, had been a Franciscan friar before converting to the Protestant faith. He was a fervent protestant with Jewish ancestors. \\"...and I if should say that my ancestors were Hebrews before baptism, this I will not deny..\\" Florio, Michelangelo, Apologia, 1557. He got into trouble with the Inquisition in Italy, after preaching in Naples, Padua, and Venice. Seeking refuge in England during the reign of Edward VI, he was appointed pastor of the Italian Protestant congregation in London in 1550.Ives p. 65 He was also a member of the household of William Cecil. He was dismissed from both on a charge of immorality, but William Cecil later fully forgave him. Little is known of Florio's mother; it has been suggested she was an English woman, \\"De uxore, quae Angla Videtur, et liberi nihil constant\\" Simmler in Florio, M., Apologia, 1557, p. 13, n.2 given John's knowledge of the language. However, it is more likely she was Italian or French, being a servant in the house of Cecil. Furthermore, in First Fruits, John Florio asserted that the first time he arrived in London he didn't know the language and asked in Italian or French \\"where the post dwelt. \\"When I arrived first in London, I coulde not speake English, and i met above five hundred persons, afore i coulde find one, that could tel me in Italian, or French, where the Post dwelt\\" Florio, J., His First Fruits, 1578, Thomas Woodcocke, London. He later explained that learnt the language by reading books. Michelangelo Florio then became Italian tutor to Lady Jane Grey and in the family of William Herbert, 1st Earl of Pembroke, father of Henry Herbert, 2nd Earl of Pembroke who would become the husband of Mary Sidney, sister of Philip Sidney. He dedicated a book to Henry Herbert and Jane Grey, his highest-ranking pupils: Regole de la lingua thoscana (Rules of the Tuscan language). Lady Jane Grey's youth, faith, and death affected him deeply and later, in seclusion, in Soglio in Switzerland, he wrote a book about her life, titled \\"Historia de la vita e de la morte de L'Illlustriss. Signora Giovanna Graia\\", published later in 1607. In the preface of the book, the anonymous publisher explained that the original book was written \\"by his own hand by the author\\" and it was found \\"after his death, in the home of an honored and great benefactor.\\" It is also explained that Michalangelo \\"would certainly have had this book published in that he had not been prevented from very cruel persecutions. He in fact deposed it for fifty years in safe hands\\".Michelangelo Florio, Historia de la vita e dela morte de l'Illustriss. Signora Giovanna Graia, 1607, Riccardo Pittore di Venezia. He describes Lady Jane Gray as a martyr and innocent \\"saint\\". It is possible that he had witnessed some of the events surrounding her or had told her about the persecutions in Italy. Exile When Mary Tudor ascended to the throne in 1554, she re-established Catholicism in England and Ireland. In February 1554, a royal edict proclaimed that all strangers had to avoid the realm within twenty-four days. Consequently, on 4 March 1554, Michelangelo and his family, which included infant John, left England. Florio, Michelangelo, Apologia, \\"...Where we were until March, 4, 1554. And there left me with my little family I came to Anversa in Alemagna. And I went to Argentina (Strasbourg) on May 6th, 1555\\" pp. 108‚Äì112. In Strasbourg, the generous citizens offered themselves to give a first temporary refuge to the exiles for twenty days. Here, Michelangelo had a first meeting with the noble Frederik von Salis, coming from Soglio, who invited him to become pastor of the Reformed Evangelical Church of Graub√ºnden in Soglio.Florio, M., Apologia, pp. 108‚Äì112. Soglio was remote from the Inquisition and was situated near Chiavenna (north of Lake Como in Italy), a centre of Reformed preaching. In the first years of John's infancy, Michelangelo worked as pastor and notary, educating his son in an environment rich in religious and theological ferment. In addition, he taught John Italian, as well as Latin, Hebrew and Greek. Michelangelo Florio died in 1566, after this date his name is no longer mentioned and in the synod of 1571 he is mentioned as a deceased person. Cantimori, D., Eretici italiani del Cinquecento, Torino, Einaudi, 2002, p. 292. When he was ten, John Florio was sent to live with and to be schooled in a Paedagogium in T√ºbingen (Germany) by the Reformed Protestant theologian, Pier Paolo Vergerio, a native of Venetian Capodistria (who had also lived in Swiss Bregaglia). Under these circumstances, John was formed in the humanist cultural circle of T√ºbingen, in a strong Italianate atmosphere. Unfortunately, he never completed his studies. Vergerio, in fact, died in 1566. Without any financial support, and orphan at 14 years old, he left T√ºbingen. He came back temporarily to Soglio, and later departed for England in the early 1570s, in possession of a formidable Christian Reformed and humanist education.  London: First Fruits & Leicester's Men (1571‚Äì1578) = First marriage  At about 18 years old, after his formative years in Soglio and in T√ºbingen, John Florio came back to London. Ascribed to the French church, John worked for some years as silk dyer and servant of Michel Baynard. In addition, he worked for the Venetian merchant Gaspare Gatti, living in the wool-dyers' district of London. At 21 years old he married an Italian woman, Anna Soresollo; they had five children: Annebelle, Joane, Edward, Aurelia and Elizabeth. It has been wrongly suggested by Antony Wood that John married Samuel Daniel's sister No record of their marriage has so far been discovered, and Wood's suggestion was probably mainly due to Daniel's dedication lines in Florio's translation of Montaigne's Essays in which he referred to him as his \\"brother\\", suggesting a long-time friendship, more than an actually kinship between them. However, it is more likely that it was John's sister, Justina, who married Samuel Daniel. Robert Anderson, in fact, confirms that Daniel \\"left no issue by his wife Justina, sister of John Florio.\\"  First Fruits  At 25 years old John Florio published Firste Fruites which yeelde familiar speech, merie prouerbes, wittie sentences, and golden sayings. Also a perfect induction to the Italian, and English tongues, as in the table appeareth. The like heretofore, neuer by any man published (1578). This collection of dramatic dialogues contains translated passages from literature and philosophy. Moreover, it is designed for novices in both the Italian and English language. Florio inscribed the manual to \\"All Italian gentlemen and merchants who delight in the English tongue\\". He dedicated his first work to Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. In the dedication, John reminded Dudley of his father's faithful service, successfully entering his social circle. In the manual, John Florio refers to himself as \\"povero artigiano\\" (poor artisan). His insistence upon the fact that the teaching was not his profession indicates that this was the very first time he approached the languages as a profession. In addition, the commendatory verses that precede Firste Fruites show that John Florio got in contact with the Dudley's theatre company: The Leicester's men. The first pages of the First Fruits, in fact, contain various commendatory verses written by the company actors: Richard Tarlton, Robert Wilson, Thomas Clarke, and John Bentley. They thank him for having contributed to bring the Italian novelist to the English theatre. With Firste Fruites, John Florio began a new career in London in the language-teaching while having contacts with the theatre.  Oxford: Euphuism & Cartier's Voyages (1578‚Äì1582) = Oxford  By the summer of 1578, he was sent by Lord Burleigh, William Cecil, to Magdalen College, Oxford. He entered as a poor scholar and became servant and tutor in Italian to Barnabe and Emmanuel Barnes, sons of the Bishop of Durham. John Florio remained at Oxford at least until 1582. Magdalene College today commemorates his time there with the John Florio Society that meets to appreciate its members' own poems.  Euphuism  During these years John matured as a lexicographer and made the development of modern English language his primary mission. Firstly, he became tutor in Italian to John Lyly. As the author considered to be the first English prose stylist to leave an enduring impression upon the language, Lyly was a key figure of Euphuism. Another Euphuist and pupil of John Florio was Stephen Gosson. Both Gosson and Lyly adopted the Euphuistic style and were saturated in Italian reading through John Florio's lessons. It is possible that another Euphuist, George Pettie, was the \\"I.P.\\" who signed the Italian verses that prefaced the First Fruits.  Cartier's Voyages  In Oxford, beside his job as Italian tutor, John Florio also began a career as translator. He met Richard Hakluyt, an English writer who was very passionate about maritime literature. His collaboration with Florio was very fruitful: he commissioned him to translate Jacques Cartier's voyage to Canada. Later, in 1580, Florio published his translation under the name A Shorte and briefe narration of the two navigations and discoveries to the northweast partes called Newe Fraunce: first translated out of French into Italian by that famous learned man Gio : Bapt : Ramutius, and now turned into English by John Florio; worthy the reading of all venturers, travellers, and discoverers. Florio quickly developed an awareness of the potential of the ‚ÄòNew World‚Äô, he advocates \\"planting\\" the \\"New-found land\\" four years before Hakluyt and Raleigh, the pioneers of colonisation. He threw himself early into the spirit of these English patriotic ventures. Furthermore, he committed himself to both refine the English language and be a contributor of England's colonial enterprise.  At the French Embassy (1583‚Äì1585)  Between the summer of 1583 and 1585 John Florio moved with his family to the French embassy. It was situated in London, at Beaumont House, Butcher Row. The French ambassador at the time was Michel de Castelnau, Lord of Mauvissiere. Castelnau employed Florio for two years as a tutor in languages to his daughter Catherine Marie. Secondly, he also employed him \\"in other honourable employment\\", in the discharge of which duties he \\"bore himself prudently, honestly and faithfully\\".Calendar of State Papers, Foreign Series, 1585‚Äì1586. As a result, Florio earned the warm commendation of his master and all the household. His duties, beside that of tutor, translator and interpreter, were of personal secretary and legal representative of the ambassador when the latter departed from London.  The Babington Plot  During the captivity of Mary, Queen of Scots, several attempts were made to place her on the English throne. The most significant of these was the Babington Plot, which ultimately led to Mary's trial and execution in 1587. William Vaughan's Golden Fleece was written one year after Florio's death, in 1626 and it contains references to Florio's involvement in the conspiracy of Babington of 1586. Walsingham, also thanks to Florio's help, as suggested by Vaughan, was able to intercept and decode Mary's correspondence.  A Letter Lately Written from Rome (1585)  At the French embassy, John Florio also embarked in a new, pioneering job as translator of news. In the Elizabethan England this trend had a tremendous demand, and quickly became a class of literature. Newspapers were not yet born. Even so, Florio intuitively began to translate several Italian newsletters that had been dispatched from Rome to France, turning them into novels. The resulting pamphlet was published in 1585 entitled A letter lately written from Rome, by an Italian gentleman to a freende of his in Lyons in Fraunce, and signed I.F. Translated from Italian, Florio dedicated it to Henry Stanley, the Earl of Derby. It has been pointed out that no original document titled A letter lately written from Rome exist and that the work was written or at least compiled by Florio himself who borrowed news from Italy, edited them, and created an entirely different piece of work to adapt it to an English audience.  Giordano Bruno & The Ash Wednesday Supper  Living with Giordano Bruno was the most important experience Florio had at the French Embassy. Bruno's influence will have a huge impact upon him. The philosopher, undoubtedly shaped Florio's character changing his vision of life and world permanently. John Florio embraced Bruno's philosophy, and above all, the thesis upon the infinite universe and the possibility of life on other planets, theories which went well beyond the Copernican limited heliocentric world. Bruno received many attacks after the quarrel and tumultuous period that followed the \\"Ash Wednesday Supper\\". During that party he discussed his revolutionary theories, and after that, he got into a quarrel with the guests who didn't receive with favour his ideas. Undoubtedly, Florio and Castelnau always defended him. Bruno described the event in a philosophical pamphlet written the same year: The Ash Wednesday Supper (London, 1584). The friendship that linked Bruno and Florio is particularly rich and significant. Florio in fact appears in The Ash Wednesday Supper as one of the messengers that brings to Bruno the invitation to dinner by Fulke Greville. In another scene Bruno and Florio are on a boat at night. They burst into song chanting stanzas from Ludovico Ariosto's Orlando Furioso. \\"'Oh feminil ingegno' warbled the Nolan, following Messer Florio's rendering of 'Dove, senza me, dolce mia vita' which he sang as though thinking of his loves\\". Bruno, G., La cena de le ceneri, (London, 1584). Bruno would later portray him as \\"Eliotropo\\" in De la causa, principio et uno, (London, 1584). In De l'infinito, universo e mondi, (London, 1584), fifth dialogue, Bruno adds Florio as \\"Elpino\\" and Alberico Gentili as \\"Albertino\\". Similarly, Florio returned the compliment by introducing the figure of Bruno, \\"Il Nolano\\" (from Nola near Naples), in Second Fruits (1591). He portrayed him lounging on a window-seat, leafing through a book and poking fun at his friend John for taking too much time over getting dressed in the morning. The portrait painted by Florio is undoubtedly that of a friend. Bruno surely appears in his pages in a positive light, like a satirical and healthy whip of pedants. Florio will never forget Giordano Bruno, even after the long years of the trial and their tragic outcome at the stake. For instance, in 1603, John Florio, in the preface of Montaigne's Essays, recalled his old \\"fellow Nolano\\", who had taught him the cultural value of translations.\\"Yea but my olde fellow Nolano tolde me, and taught publikely, that from translation all Science had its of- spring.\\" John Florio, \\"To the Corteous Reader\\", Montaigne's Essays, 1603. Moreover, in 1611, he listed Bruno's Italian works among the texts he used for the composition of the dictionary. Bruno's scholars Gentile and Vincenzo Spampanato have both proved Florio's indebtedness to the philosopher's writings. Many of Bruno's thoughts are undeniably shaped in Florio's work Second Fruits. Also, in his two dictionaries Florio added many terms as well as Neapolitan dialect words taken from Bruno's works.  Second Fruits (1591)  Second Fruits is John Florio's second work. Entitled Second Frutes to be gathered of twelve trees, of diverse but delightful tastes to the tongues of Italian and English (1591), it appeared thirteen years after the publication of the First Fruits, and is a product of perhaps the most interesting period of his life. The dedicatory epistle is a \\"remarkably comprehensive sketch of current publication in the various fields of journalism, poetry, and the drama.\\" The Epistle to the reader of the Second Fruits shows that Florio had recently been meeting with adverse criticism because of his Italian sympathies: \\"As for me, for it is I, and I am an Englishman in Italiane; I know they haue a knife at command to cut my throate, Un Inglese Italianato √© un Diavolo Incarnato.\\" Defining himself an Englishman in Italiane, John Florio writes a two-fold defence of Italian culture in England and of the practise of translation. The Epistle Dedicatorie shows that Florio knew that his Second Fruits was a provocative work, and here for the first time he signs himself with the adjective that stuck to him through life and after death: Resolute John Florio. Unlike his earlier manual, Florio's Second Fruits is prefaced by a single commendatory sonnet: \\"Phaeton to his friend Florio\\". This is one of the earliest Elizabethan sonnets to be printed, and was published in the Second Fruits, an Italian language book which contains a heterogeneous stock of raw materials for contemporary sonneteers.  Giardino di Ricreatione  Proverbs were a usual feature of most Elizabethan language lesson books, but in no manual did they play such an all-important part as in the Second Fruits. The proverbs of the book are, in fact, keyed with those published in a corollary work by Florio, the Giardino di Ricreatione: six thousands Italian proverbs, without their English equivalents. It is one of the most important of the earlier collections of this kind. The title itself is interesting: Giardino di ricreatione, nel quel crescono fronde, fiori e frutti, vaghe, leggiadri e soavi; sotto nome di auree sentenze, belli proverbii, et piacevoli riboboli, tutti Italiani, colti, scelti, e scritti, per Giovanni Florio, non solo utili ma dilettevoli per ogni spirito vago della Nobil lingua Italiana. Il numero d'essi √© di 3400. The proverbs in the Italian side of the dialogues are starred to indicate that they are listed among the six thousand Italian proverbs collected in the Giardino.  Tutor to Henry Wriothesley  It is not certain when John Florio took the role of tutor to Henry Wriothesley, Third Earl of Southampton. Countess Clara Longworth de Chambrun was the first to suggest that Florio had been tutoring the Southampton before 1590. She points out that in Second Fruits (1591), there is a dialogue between John Florio and Henry, they play tennis together and go to see a play at theatre. For Frances Yates too, this identification meets with some support from the fact that in the dialogue John quotes the proverb \\"Chi si contenta gode\\", which is the motto on Florio's portrait. Moreover, the topics touched on in the Second Fruits, like primero, the theatre, love, and tennis, represent Southampton's tastes. Florio's entrance into this brilliant literary circle closely associated with the drama, marks a very important stage in his career. When he published his first dictionary, A World of Words, in 1598, Florio dedicated his laborious work to Henry: \\"In truth I acknowledge an entyre debt, not onely of my best knowledge, but of all, yea of more then I know or can, to your bounteous Lordship most noble, most vertuous, and most Honorable Earle of Southampton, in whose paie and patronage I have lived some yeeres; to whom I owe and vowe the yeeres I have to live. But as to me, and manie more the glorious and gracious sunne-shine of your Honor hath infused light and life: so may my lesser borrowed light, after a principall respect to your benigne aspect, and influence, afforde some lustre to some others.\\" John Florio, A Worlde of Wordes, The Epistle Dedicatorie, 1598  Danvers‚ÄìLong Feud  On Friday 4 October 1594, John Florio took part in the famous Danvers case, backing Henry's friends in their efforts to escape. Henry Danvers and Sir Charles Denvers were the two elder sons of Sir John Danvers of Dauntsey. Both close friends to Henry Wriothesley, they committed a crime in Wiltshire. According to one account, Henry Long was dining in the middle of the day with a party of friends in Cosham, when Henry Danvers, followed by his brother Charles and a number of retainers, burst into the room, and shot Long dead on the spot. According to another account, Henry Long had challenged Charles Danvers, that he was pressing an unfair advantage and had his arm raised to kill. When Henry Danvers thrust himself between to ward off the blow, was wounded in the act, and striking upwards with his dagger killed Henry Long accidentally. Master Lawrence Grose, Sheriff, was informed on the murder, and on the evening of October 12th the following scene took place at Itchen's Ferry: \\"The said Grose, passing over Itchen‚Äôs Ferry with his wife that Saturday 12th, one Florio an Italian, and one Humphrey Drewell a servant of the Earl, being in the said passage boat threatened to cast Grose overboard, and said they would teach him to meddle with their fellows, with many other threatening words.\\" John Florio had a close relationship with Henry Wriothesley at least until 1603, when Henry's family, Florio and other friends of the Southampton, flocked to him when he was released from the Tower.  A World of Words (1598)  While he was engaged in the service of Henry Wriothesley, Florio produced a work which remains a landmark in the history of Italian scholarship in England. A Worlde of Wordes, or Dictionarie of the Italian and English tongues (London, 1598) is an Italian‚ÄìEnglish Dictionary, and, as such, only the second of its kind in England and much fuller than the short work published by William Thomas in the 1550s ‚Äì with 44,000 words as opposed to Thomas's 6,000. Published by Edward Blount, and dedicated to Roger, Earl of Rutland, Henry, Earl of Southampton, and Lucy, Countess of Bedford, this work marked Florio as a scholar of the first magnitude. In the Epistle Dedicatorie John Florio celebrates the Italian language; however, his attitude towards English language is now changed. If in First Fruits he found the language \\"besitted with manu languages\\" now he's moved a step nearer appreciating what he now defines the \\"sweete-mother-toonge\\" of his native land. The cited sources that follow the \\"Epistle Dedicatorie\\" of 1598 include a corpus that is made up mostly of contemporary literary texts, ranging from Sannazaro's Arcadia and Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata to Castiglione's Cortegiano, Della Casa's Galateo, and Caro's Lettere famigliari, as well as wide range of Dialoghi such as those written by Sperone Speroni and Stefano Guazzo. Fourteen citations alone or one-sixth of the catalogue are sources from Pietro Aretino, highlighting Florio's interest in theatrical texts and his willingness to capitalise on his English readers' salacious interest in Aretino's explicitly erotic and sexual content. Florio was shrewd enough to realise that if his Italian-English dictionary drew much of its vocabulary from such a popular author as Aretino, it would be well received by all those who wished to study first-hand Aretino's lashing satire, bawdy language, and journalistic style.O'Connor, D. J., \\"John Florio's contribution to Italian- English lexicography\\", Italica, 49, 1972, 49‚Äì67, p. 49. A World of Words is a work of art in itself, the dictionary is an extraordinary resource not only for the history of Italian in Italy and abroad, but also for the history of early Modern English. It is a work that brings together the author's three major roles: Florio as the plurilingual reader and word collector; Florio as teacher of Italian language and culture, as a grammarian and paroemiologist; and Florio as translator and creative writer.Florio, J., A Worlde of Wordes, A critical edition, with an introduction by Haller, W., Hermann, 2013, XX  Groom of the Privy Chamber (1604‚Äì1619) = Florio & Queen Anne  With the accession of James I John Florio's life at court begins a new chapter. He became Groom of the Privy Chamber, lived at court, and had a prestigious position at the centre of power. From 1604 to Queen Anne's death in 1619 he had a secure income, and his life was on a steadier course. Florio's duties and his influence over the Queen at court emerge from various official documents. First, he became reader in Italian to Queen Anne and one of the grooms of her privy chamber. In a document dated March 1619 there is a list of Queen Anne's \\"Grooms of the Privy Chamber\\" with the length of their service and the amounts of their yearly salary. In this Florio is stated to have served her for fifteen years at a salary of one hundred pounds per annum. This makes 1604 the year in which John Florio began his court service. A groom's salary was sixty pounds per annum. The higher rate in Florio's case seems to have been due to his additional functions as reader in Italian and private secretary to the Queen. He also wrote her letters and interviewed people for her. In addition to his attendance on the Queen, John Florio was also tutor in Italian and French to Prince Henry at court. = Diplomatic affairs = From Ottaviano Lotti's dispatches, the representative of the Grand Duke of Tuscany in London, we know that John Florio had a major and confidential role with the Queen at court.\\"\\"..and I do not know if it is by chance that this Florio, who is with the Queen all day long teaching her the Italian language and hearing her conversation on all subjects and who writes all her most confidential letters, said to the Pincess, \\"Madame, I shall see Your Royal Highness made a Queen one day\\". And the Princess promised him if that came to pass a large gift, and added, \\"Whoever thinks that I will marry a Prince who is not absolute is mistaken.\\" Ottaviano Lotti, Archivio di Stato, Florence. Archivio Mediceo, 4189. This throws a flood of light upon Florio's position with the Queen, which turns out to have been much more important than has hitherto been guessed. Florio was also in close contact with Giovanni Carlo Scaramelli, Secretary to the Signoria; their relationship was important as it determined the political relationship between Venice and London at the time. Other ambassadors Florio got in contact with are Zorzi Giustinian, ambassador of Venice in London from January 1606 to 1608, Nicolo Molino, Henry Wotton, and many others. This diplomatic partnership between London and Venice, the English and Venetian agents and ambassadors, had John Florio as the crucial link between the two worlds. = Ben Jonson = Another Florio's tasks at court was to interview and select musicians, often Italian ones, who were seeking an introduction at court. Ottaviano Lotti, for example, in 1606 asked Florio to assist with his influence a musician, who wishes to obtain employment at court. They arranged a supper-party with the idea of inducing Florio to introduce the musician and his lyre at court. This shows not only another accomplishment Florio added in his career, but also another talent: his musical competence. The importance and influence which Florio's established reputation and his court position gave him are illustrated by the fact that books were now dedicated to him. These dedications reveal that he had some association during these years with Nicholas Breton, Ben Jonson, and Thomas Thorpe. John Florio's friendship with Ben Jonson is of great interest and importance. It is well-attested by an inscription written in Ben's own hand upon the fly-leaf of a copy of Volpone which is now in the British Museum: \\"To his louing Father, & worthy Freind, Mr John Florio: The ayde of his Muses. Ben: Jonson seales this testemony of Freindship, & Loue.\\" The word \\"Father\\" which the dramatist uses in addressing his friend, suggests not only the disparity in their ages. It most importantly implies some suggestion of discipleship, with a more striking tribute by speaking of him as \\"The ayde of his Muses\\". = Thomas Thorpe = Thomas Thorpe, in 1610, published a translation from Epictetus his Manuall. He dedicated this work to Florio, reminding him that he had procured a patron for an earlier work of John Healey's His apprentises essay, and hoping that he would do the same by this one. In the three existing dedications by Thorpe, other than that to W. H., the first is addressed to Florio, the two others to the Earl of Pembroke, while the other, some years before, is addressed to the editor, Edward Blount. We thus have Thorpe's evidence that Florio procured him the Pembroke's patronage. He also did the same for John Healey. Florio secured the patronage of William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke for Healey's The Discovery of a New World. This work was an extremely free and humour version of the \\"Latin Mundus Alter ed Idem\\", a satire of England. Moreover, in 1609, John Florio gave to Thomas Thorpe both his translation of Healey's Discovery of a New World and the collection of Shake-Speares sonnets.  Montaigne's Essays (1603)  Florio's translation of Michel de Montaigne's Essays was licensed for publication to Edward Blount on 4 June 1600, and eventually published three years later, in 1603. Florio's translation of the Essays came to be highly regarded as a literary art during the Elizabethan period. It was dedicated to six ladies of the court. The first book is for the Countess of Bedford and her mother. The second is divided between Lady Penelope Rich, Sidney's Stella, and his daughter, Elizabeth, Countess of Rutland. He also adds an appropriate eulogy of the 'perfect-unperfect' Arcadia. The third is given gracefully to two of Florio's younger pupils. They are Lady Elizabeth Grey, daughter of the Earl of Shrewbury, and Lady Mary Nevill, daughter of England's Lord High Treasurer.Matthiessen, F. O., Translation, an Elizabethan art, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1931, p. 116. In the letter addressed to the courteous reader, Florio champions translation as the most useful route for advancing knowledge and developing the language and culture of a nation. Again, here he connects this important issue with the recent army of opponents connected with the medievalism still firmly entrenched at the universities that were the most important sources of opposition. In his defence of translation, John Florio explained that there are many likely French words in his translation of Montaigne's Essays that, by being coupled with common words to explain them, may be \\"familiar with our English, which well may beare them.\\" He cites a number of such words he created, which he says some critics may object to: \\"entraine, conscientious, endeare, tarnish, comporte, efface, facilitate, ammusing, debauching, regret, effort, emotion.\\" In the pages \\"Of the Caniballes\\" he borrows French words which were already in circulation but of late introduction and of restricted use. Some examples are febricitant, supplant, puissant. And at least one which appeared in an English text for the very first time: contexture. A key word for Montaigne which was used later by Bacon.Morini, M., Tudor Translation in Theory and Practice, Routledge, 2006, p. 88 Florio consciously experimented with English, grafting into it words and phrases from other languages. This led him to create not just new words, but also new grammatical constructions. For example, he was the first writer to use the genitive neuter pronoun \\"its\\". In his love of doubling, John Florio had taken the freedom of inventing compounds. \\"L'ame plaine\\" becomes \\"a mind full-fraught\\", \\"doux & aggreable\\" is \\"a pleasing-sweet and gently-gliding speech\\". Words are combined in almost every fashion, and often with an extraordinarily fine effect. For example: \\"marble-hearted\\". While the note of the sonnet cycles is caught in \\"Pride-puft majestie\\", \\"the fresh-bleeding memorie\\". Another great compound is \\"with hight-swelling and heaven- disimbowelling words.\\" Florio continually makes such alteration for the sake of a fuller picture. Such striving for action are always uppermost in his mind. Florio's habit of seeing and saying things dramatically is one of his most distinctive qualities.Matthiessen, F. O., Translation, an Elizabethan art, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1931, p. 146. To read Montaigne's Essays in Florio's translation is to read them, as it were, over the shoulders of some of England's greatest writers.Greenblatt, S., Shakespeare's Montaigne: The Florio Translation of the Essays, A Selection, NYRB Classics, 2014, X  Queen Anna's New World of Words (1611)  Florio's magnum opus as lexicographer was his augmented dictionary, Queen Anna's New World of Words, or Dictionarie of the Italian and English tongues (London 1611), embracing nearly 74,000 definitions. Not only was the volume almost twice larger than its predecessor, containing about 75,000 definitions, but in preparing it he had consulted 249 books, of which one-fifth appeared on the Index of prohibited books as against 72 listed in the World of Words, most belonging to the 17th century. These figures may be compared with the first edition of the Florentine Vocabolario della Crusca, published in 1612, which lists 230 works as sources for its material. The sources consulted by John Florio are listed in the work and include books on all phrases of general and specialised knowledge. The definitions are so fully treated that for the most part the work is not only a dictionary but is also an encyclopedia of general knowledge of the time. One of the most interesting features of the book-list is the high percentage of dramatic works which it contains. Vincenzo Spampanato has classified these as three tragedies (one of these, the Rosmunda of Rucellai, was one of the earliest modern regular tragedies) two tragi-comedies, Guarini's Pastor Fido, and Celestina translated from the Spanish, five pastorals, among them being Aminta. The largest class are comedies, including Terence translated by Fabrini, Machiavelli's Clizia, and many other comedies of the Intronati di Siena. In fact, approximately one-sixth of all the sources cited by Florio are now comedies, tragedies and pastorals by such authors as Giovanni Battista Giraldi Cinthio, Matteo Bandello, Giovanni Boccaccio, Pietro Aretino, Machiavelli, Fiorentino, Ariosto, Sannazzaro, Tasso, and many old Italian Commedia dell'Arte's authors, for a total number of 39 plays. In his search for words, Florio had also studied in Italian translations classical authors such as Tacitus, Cicero, Plato, Plutarch, Ovid, Pliny. Besides this wide reading in all subjects a close acquaintance with purely literary masterpieces is demanded of a lexicographer. The list shows that Dante had been studied with the aid of four commentators, Vellutello, Daniello, Boccaccio and Landino. Florio must have possessed a detailed knowledge of Dante, which was unusual at the period.  Later Years = Second Marriage  In 1617, at the age of 65, Florio married Rose Spicer, his second wife. She nursed him through his last years and in his will he refers to her in terms of tender affection. The period as Groom of the Privy Chamber and Personal Secretary to the Queen were for Florio happy years. Anne had promised him a pension of ¬£100 a year until death. But as King James‚Äô financial position worsened these Court pensions were never paid. Many loyal old courtiers were abandoned to poverty in the last years of his reign. Despite not being wealthy as he was before, Florio remained attached to all the things that once belonged to the Queen. Even after her death, he never sold them. Florio, in fact, still possessed her presents when he made his will, including her writing desk set with pearls and fitted with silver ink wells and sand box.  Boccaccio's Decameron  In 1620 Florio published the translation of Boccaccio's Decameron anonymously. His translation omits the Proemio and Conclusione dell'autore, while replacing Tale III.x with an innocuous story taken from Francois de Belleforest's Histoires tragiques, concluding that it \\"was commended by all the company...because it was free from all folly and obscoeneness.\\" Tale IX.x is also modified, while Tale V.x loses its homosexual innuendo.The Decameron and Collected Works of Giovanni Boccaccio (Illustrated), Delphi Classics (2017).  Will and library  In 1623, two years before his death, at 70 years old, John Florio made his last will. He bequeathed his library to William Herbert, Earl of Pembroke. He also gave him \\"an unbound volume of divers written collections and rapsodies\\", asking him to place his books in his library \\"eyther at Wilton or els at Baynards Castle at London.\\" Sadly, his beloved books never reached Wilton or Baynards Castle at London as requested. For unknown reasons, the executors named in the will renounced execution. Florio's library has since disappeared. In his will John Florio mentioned \\"about\\" 340 books, most of them Italian, but also French, Spanish and English. Over the centuries some Florio scholars have attempted the impossible task of locating parts of his library. Arundel Del Re in his book about John Florio and First Fruits admitted he found only one book that belonged to Florio's library. This is the Imprese by Paolo Giovio, and bears Florio's signature: the book is now held in the British Library. Frances Yates, Florio's biographer, asserted that she once had seen an annotated copy of Chaucer that belonged to John Florio. In 2019, this copy was sold online by Peter Harrington. The cover contains John Florio's handwriting: \\"J. Florio: Ex dono John Dony.\\" The copy is now at Yale university. Michael Wyatt, in his study \\"La biblioteca in volgare di John Florio\\" (\\"The Vernacular Library of John Florio\\") identified all the editions of the books used by Florio in compiling his dictionaries. John Florio died in Fulham, London, in about October 1625, a victim of the plague. His descendants became Royal Physicians, part of the fabric of the highly educated English professional classes. Shakespeare authorship theory Florio is one of the many individuals who have been proposed as the real author of the works of William Shakespeare by advocates of the Shakespeare authorship question. The first to suggest that there was a link between John Florio and Shakespeare was Thomas Spencer Baynes, English philosopher, author and editor of the Ninth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. He himself wrote, in 1902, the Britannica article on Shakespeare, divided in 46 parts. Part 31 is dedicated to John Florio, and his connection with Shakespeare, titled \\"Shakespeare Goes to London (cont.): Shakespeare Continues his Education. His Connection with Florio.\\" He also included this chapter in his book Shakespeare studies, and essay on English dictionaries (1896). Baynes suggests that Shakespeare was well acquainted with Florio's First Fruits, in which there are many proverbs and dialogues Shakespeare used in his works. Same with Second Fruits, in which there is also one of the earliest Elizabethan sonnet to be printed: \\"Phaeton to his friend Florio\\". For Baynes, Shakespeare is also well aware of Florio's translation of Montaigne's Essays, as well as his two dictionaries that he frequently used in his plays. He also underlines that both Shakespeare and Florio had the same patron Henry Wriothesley: Shakespeare dedicated his Venus and Adonis and his Lucrece to this young nobleman; and three years later, in 1598, Florio dedicated the first edition of his Italian dictionary to the earl in terms that almost recall Shakespeare's words. Shakespeare had said in addressing the earl, \\"What I have done is yours, what I have to do is yours, being part in all I have devoted yours.\\" And Florio says, \\"In truth I acknowledge an entire debt, not only of my best knowledge, but of all, yea of more than I know or can to your bounteous lordship, most noble, most virtuous, and most honour- able earl of Southampton, in whose pay and patronage I have lived some years, to whom I owe and vow the years I have to live.\\" Baynes also notices that both Shakespeare and Florio also knew Robert Dudley, The Earl of Derby, and became Groom of the privy chamber in 1604. He, then, concludes dismantling the old legend of Florio as Holofernes - labelled as \\"the climax of reckless guesswork and absurd suggestion\\" - that Florio was a friend and literary associate to whom Shakespeare felt personally indebted. Later, the case for an Italian, either John or his father Michelangelo Florio, was proposed by Santi Paladino in 1927, but Paladino mixed up John and his father Michelangelo. He claimed that Florio came from a Calvinist family in Sicily. Forced to flee to Protestant England, he created \\"Shakespeare\\" by translating his Sicilian mother's surname, Crollalanza, into English.. John Florio was first specifically proposed by Erik Reger, in a review of Paladino's pamphlet entitled \\"Der Italiener Shakespeare\\" contributed during 1927 to the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung. Paladino later argued that the two Florios worked together. He continued to publish on the subject into the 1950s; in his later writings he argued that Michelangelo Florio wrote the works in Italian, and his son John rendered them into English. One or both of the Florios have since been promoted by Franz Maximilian Saalbach (1954), journalist Martino Iuvara (2002), and Lamberto Tassinari (2008). F. O. Matthiessen, in his analysis of Florio's translation of Montaigne's Essays, suggested the similarity between Florio's and Shakespeare's style, concluding that \\"Shakespeare and Florio were constantly talking with the same people, hearing the same theories, breathing the same air.\\"F. O. Matthiessen, Translation, an Elizabethan Art, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1931. Florio's biographer Clara Longworth de Chambrun made an extensive analysis of Florio's dramatic dialogues of First Fruits, Second Fruits and passages from Montaigne's Essays, doing a comparison with Shakespeare's dialogues and pointing out the similarities between the two writers.Chambrun, Clara (Longworth) comtesse de, Giovanni Florio, un ap√¥tre de la renaissance en Angleterre a l'√©poque de Shakespeare, 1921. Same textual and linguistic analysis has been done by Rinaldo C. Simonini, who compared Florio's dramatic dialogues of First Fruits and Second Fruits with Shakespeare's plays.Simonini, C. R., Italian Scholarship in Renaissance England, University of North Carolina, 1952. Frances Yates suggested that the vexed question of the relationship between John Florio and Shakespeare requires a fresh new consideration. Saul Gerevini and Giulia Harding have also argued that John Florio's language appears poetically similar to that of Shakespeare. Saul Gervini highlights the fact that in the first ever written mention of Shakespeare as a playwright, by Robert Green, Shakespeare is identified as someone called Johannes (Latin name of John). Stuart Kells has suggested that John Florio worked as collaborator of Shakespeare's plays along with Ben Jonson and as editor of the First Folio.Kells, Stuart, Shakespeare's Library: Unlocking the Greatest Mystery in Literature, Text Publishing Company, 2018. Saul Frampton in a Guardian's article published in 2013, has suggested that Florio was the editor of the First Folio, stating that \\"We cannot tell for certain whether the words were written by John Florio or by William Shakespeare.\\" Jeremy Lester argues a far deeper implication of John Florio in the production of Shakespeare's play than previously thought.Lester, Jeremy, \\"The 'Ayde of his Muses?' The Renaissance of John Florio and William Shakespeare\\", Gramma: Journal of Theory and Criticism.

It is located south-west of Bristol. Its population in 2011 was 7,552. The parish includes Claverham, a small village which was originally a farming hamlet. The origins of the village and its name are unclear; however, there is evidence of Iron Age hill fort and a Roman villa in the area. The arrival of the railway in the 19th century and more recent road building have led to expansion of the village with Yatton now acting as a home to many commuters, while also supporting manufacturing industry and commerce. The village is located on the North Somerset Levels, where the low-lying land, a mixture of peat, estuarine alluvium and low hills of sand and gravel, is crossed by a myriad of watercourses, providing a habitat for several scarce species. St Mary's Church dates from the 14th century and there are a range of other places of worship. In addition to religious groups, Yatton has several sporting clubs and other community groups.  History = Toponymy  The origin of the name Yatton is uncertain. It may come from the Anglo-Saxon 'gatton' meaning 'village on the track'; the track in question is a path of limestone leading from Cadbury Hill. The village has at one time or another been called Jatune, Eaton (from ea [river] and tun i.e. the settlement on the River Yeo and Yatton Blewitt), and is recorded as Lature in the Domesday Book.  Pre-history  Situated on an area of slightly higher, drained ground surrounded by moorland (locally called a 'batch'), Yatton was a well-established village by Norman times. The remains of an Iron Age hill fort at Cadbury Hill have been discovered, as well as a Roman villa, temple and hoard of coins. Older Christian burial grounds have also been discovered on Cadbury Hill. The parish was part of the Winterstoke Hundred.  Railway  Yatton railway station In the 1840s, the Bristol & Exeter Railway, with Isambard Kingdom Brunel as consulting engineer, was opened. It was initially leased to the Great Western Railway (GWR) but taken back into full ownership in 1849 and gained its own individuality which lasted until 1876 when all the broad gauge companies in the West Country merged into an enlarged GWR. The station was originally called Clevedon Road and renamed Yatton Junction when the Clevedon branch was built in 1847. Other branches followed, to Cheddar/Wells (1869) and the Wrington Vale Light Railway (1901) to Blagdon from Congresbury. Clevedon on 31 August 1962. Although the branch line to Blagdon was closed to passengers in 1932, and the Clevedon and Cheddar/Wells lines were closed during the 1960s, the classically Victorian station designed by Brunel is still in use. From 2001 to 2006 the station was operated by Wessex Trains when, in an echo of 1876, it was again absorbed into the new Greater Western Trains Co. It is now possible to walk or cycle along the former route of the Strawberry Line (so called because of the trade in Cheddar's strawberries) from Yatton to Cheddar. A local group successfully raised funding to establish a community cafe in the old waiting room building at the station, and the cafe opened for business in December 2010. Prior to local authority cutbacks, Bakers Dolphin maintained a replacement bus connection (route 66) between Yatton and Clevedon. Rail passengers intending to visit Clevedon must now alight at Nailsea & Backwell and walk a short distance to board the First Bristol X7 bus to Clevedon.  20th century  In 1922 the site formerly known as 'The Pound' was purchased and the Yatton Parish War Memorial was erected. The memorial is located at Top Scaur, at the Congresbury end of the High Street, and is inscribed with the names of Yatton villagers who died in the First and Second World Wars. Each year on Remembrance Sunday a march is held from St Mary's Church to the memorial, where wreaths are laid by villagers and local organisations. The village has continued to increase in size with several new developments planned or currently being constructed north of the railway station near North End Road and Arnold's Way. Development to the south and east of the village has made the villages of Yatton, Claverham and Cleeve almost continuous as far as the A370. Cadbury House Country Club is being developed to become a 60-room hotel and leisure centre. The hamlet of North End lies to the north of the Arnold's Way roundabout, just before the junction for Kingston Seymour, and contains between 15 and 20 properties, including a number of farms and the Bridge Inn hotel.  Governance  The parish council, which has 18 members, has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council‚Äôs operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council. The parish falls within the unitary authority of North Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within its area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks and tourism. It is also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. North Somerset's area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters is in the town hall in Weston-super-Mare. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Woodspring district of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Long Ashton Rural District. An electoral ward exists with the same name. The ward stretches to the Bristol Channel and therefore includes Kingston Seymour in addition to Yatton. The total ward population taken from the 2011 census was 9,273. The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the North Somerset constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, currently Liam Fox, a Conservative.  Geography  The area around Yatton and Claverham, which falls within the North Somerset Levels, is a mixture of peat, estuarine alluvium and low hills of sand and gravel with, to the south the limestone ridge of Cadbury Hill, which rises to . On its summit stands an Iron Age hill fort known, in archaeological circles, as Cadbury-Congresbury in order to differentiate it from the Cadbury hillfort in South Cadbury. It appears to have been constructed in the Iron Age when one or more ramparts, with walls and ditches, were built on the steep slopes of the hill to defend an area covering some . Biddle Street has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest where management practices and the variation in the soils has resulted in the watercourses supporting a wide range of aquatic plant communities. Where open water occurs plants such as common water-starwort (Callitriche stagnalis), European frogbit (Hydrocharis morsusranae), fan- leaved water-crowfoot (Ranunculus circinatus). The calcareous influence of the underlying Compton soils also encourages whorled water-milfoil (Myriophyllum verticillatum) and stonewort (Chara sp). Also present are the nationally scarce rootless duckweed (Wolffia arrhiza) and hairlike pondweed (Potamogeton trichoides). Along with the rest of South West England, Yatton has a temperate climate generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The annual mean temperature is about 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F) with seasonal and diurnal variations, but the modifying effect of the sea restricts the range to less than that in most other parts of the United Kingdom. January is the coldest month with mean minimum temperatures between 1 ¬∞C (34 ¬∞F) and 2 ¬∞C (36 ¬∞F). July and August are the warmest, with mean daily maxima around 21 ¬∞C (70 ¬∞F). In general, December is the dullest month and June the sunniest. The south-west of England enjoys a favoured location, particularly in summer, when the Azores High extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK. Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduces exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine is about 1,600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection caused by solar surface heating sometimes forms shower clouds and a large proportion of the annual precipitation falls from showers and thunderstorms at this time of year. Average rainfall is around 800‚Äì900 mm (31‚Äì35 in). About 8‚Äì15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest; the prevailing wind direction is from the south-west.  Demography  After the Second World War the size and population of Yatton expanded dramatically. With a railway providing good access to Weston-super-Mare, Bristol and London, and similarly good access by road, the village saw large amounts of new housing development. Today the number of pre-war buildings is much smaller than the number of more recent residential and commercial constructions. According to the 2001 census, Yatton's population was 9,176.  Economy  Page's Court, known locally as 'The Precinct' Today Yatton is a large village. Page's Court ‚Äî the village's shopping precinct ‚Äî includes a supermarket and several local shops and takeaways. There are a number of thriving local businesses, including Pullin's Bakers, Costain Technology Solutions (formerly Simulation Systems Ltd), Stowell Concrete, Smart Systems, Oxford Instruments, Titan Ladders and Bob Martin Petcare. Farming remains an important activity in the area.  Education  The local education authority is North Somerset Council. Yatton has a pre-school, infant and junior schools. Secondary education is not available in the village, and so many of Yatton's children commute daily to the nearby village of Backwell in order to attend Backwell School. The school is a specialist Arts College, and includes a sixth form and takes pupils from the age of 11 (Year 7) to the age of 18 (Year 13). In November 2008, Backwell School was rated as outstanding by Ofsted.  Religious sites  The south side of St Mary's church St Mary's Church, in central Yatton, built around 1400, is often called the \\"Cathedral of the Moors\\" since it is so large compared to the village. The tower has three stages with diagonal weathered buttresses with crocketed pinnacles. There is a south-east hexagonal stair turret rising above the parapet with panelled sides to the top, and an open cusped parapet. There are stained glass windows with the coats of arms of local lords of the manor. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building. The Old Rectory was a Prebendary house, built in the 15th century and has been designated as a Grade I listed building. As well as St Mary's (Church of England), Yatton has Methodist, Catholic and independent places of worship. Yatton Methodist Church is situated on the High Street, opposite the main shopping precinct. Horsecastle Chapel, an independent evangelical church, is on Horsecastle Farm Road. River of Life Church, (was YCF) affiliated to the Assemblies of God, meets in Yatton Infant School. St Dunstan's, a Roman Catholic chapel of ease to the parish in Clevedon, is on Claverham Road. The church of St. Barnabas in Claverham, dates from 1879 and is a grade II listed building. Along with churches in Kenn, Cleeve and Kingston Seymour the churches are managed as part of the Yatton Moor Team Ministry.  Sports  There are active cricket, football and rugby clubs, two parks (Hangstones and Rock Road), a number of public houses, and many other leisure and sporting activities, including the Cleeve Claverham and Yatton Scout Group. Yatton Rugby Club was founded in 1968 and as of the end of the 2015/16 season, were promoted to the Western Counties North division, having won the Tribute Somerset Premier League for 2015/16. They run three senior sides and have an extensive junior set-up. Claverham (Yatton) Cricket Club was formed in 1905 and provides cricket to all playing levels and ages. The senior teams play in the ECB West of England Premier League.  Public services  Fire station Yatton fire station opened in 1947, after the Fire Services Act 1947, when fire service responsibility transferred from national government to local authority control after World War II. The current station was built in 1973. Today, Yatton fire station, which is part of Avon Fire and Rescue Service, runs with two appliances, a water tender ladder and a specialist hose-laying vehicle. The Yatton firefighters work on a retained duty system, which means that they do not work at the fire station, but are called to the station when a fire breaks out. They respond to emergencies in a area covering Yatton, Cleeve, Kingston Seymour, Congresbury, Wrington and Blagdon, with an average of 130‚Äì150 callouts per year. Calls vary from small grass fires to full major alerts and road traffic accidents on the busy A370 main road. The Avon Fire and Rescue Service named Yatton Fire Station was named \\"highest performing retained duty station\\" for 2010.  Notable people  George Lukins, also known as the Yatton daemoniac, was an individual famous for his alleged demonic possession and the subsequent exorcism that occurred in 1788. Ken Day was born in Yatton in 1919 and played first-class cricket for Somerset County Cricket Club in seven matches between 1950 and 1956.

Career  Born in Dresden, Haenchen began his musical career as a member of the Dresdner Kreuzchor. By the age of 15, he was already conducting performances as cantor. As a 17-year-old, he attracted widespread attention with his revival of Johann Adolph Hasse's Requiem. Haenchen subsequently studied conducting and voice at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik Carl Maria von Weber. He then attended master classes in Berlin, Leningrad and at Carinthian Summer Festival in Austria, later attending rehearsals at the Bayreuth Festival and concerts conducted by Herbert von Karajan. Haenchen's first engagement was as director of the Robert-Franz-Singakademie (choral society) in Halle and conductor of the Halle Philharmonic Orchestra in 1966. He went on to win first prize at the Carl Maria von Weber Competition in Dresden in 1971. In 1972-1973 Haenchen served as principal Kapellmeister of the Zwickau Theatre. During that period he made his debut at the Berlin State Opera, directing Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov. He appeared there regularly until 1986. From 1973 to 1976, Haenchen was conductor of the Dresden Philharmonic and a regular guest with the Semperoper. Between 1976 and 1979, he served as music director of the Mecklenburgische Staatskapelle and Staatstheater in Schwerin. Subsequently, he began to make regular appearances at Komische Oper Berlin. From 1980 to 2014 he was artistic director of the Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach Chamber Orchestra in Berlin. In 1986, Haenchen became music director of the De Nederlandse Opera (DNO) in Amsterdam and chief conductor of the Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra (NPO) and the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra. During his tenure in Amsterdam, DNO became renowned for its high-quality ensemble productions and innovative stagings. Haenchen was particularly associated with the German repertoire: Richard Strauss, Mozart, and Wagner, but he also conducted opera of Verdi, Bart√≥k, Tchaikovsky, Puccini, and Gluck. After the 1999 Ring cycle, Haenchen left his post but has continued as a guest conductor. With the NPO, the newly formed Netherlands Philharmonic Orchestra quickly rose in stature, under his leadership, not only in its opera performances but also in symphonic concerts, recordings, and foreign tours. Haenchen resigned his position in September 2002 to protest budget cuts. Haenchen has made guest appearances in virtually all the European countries and toured Japan, the United States and Canada. He has conducted operas in Amsterdam, Berlin, Bologna, Dresden, Geneva, Jerusalem, London, Madrid, Milan, Munich, New York City, Paris, Stuttgart, Warsaw, Vienna and the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden. He was scheduled to conduct Parsifal at the Bayreuth Festival in the summer of 2016 and 2017.

He was best known for his work The English Huswife, Containing the Inward and Outward Virtues Which Ought to Be in a Complete Woman, first published in London in 1615. Life Markham was the third son of Sir Robert Markham of Cotham, Nottinghamshire, and his wife, and was probably born in 1568. He was a soldier of fortune in the Low Countries, and later was a captain under the Earl of Essex's command in Ireland. He was acquainted with Latin and several modern languages, and had an exhaustive practical acquaintance with the arts of forestry and agriculture. He was a noted horse-breeder, and is said to have imported the first Arabian horse to England. Very little is known of the events of his life. The story of the murderous quarrel between Gervase Markham and Sir John Holles related in the Biographia (s.v. Holles) has been generally connected with him, but in the Dictionary of National Biography, Sir Clements R. Markham, a descendant from the same family, refers it to another contemporary of the same name, whose monument is still to be seen in Laneham church. Gervase Markham was buried at St Giles's, Cripplegate, London, on 3 February 1637.Chisholm, 1911 Works Manuscript for The cavallarie, or knowledge belonging to a captaine of horse, 1626 Markham was a voluminous writer on many subjects, but repeated himself, and sometimes reprinted books under other titles. His booksellers procured from him a declaration in 1617 that he would produce no more on certain topics. Markham's writings include: * 1593: A Discourse of Horsemanship, followed by other popular treatises on horsemanship and farriery; * 1595: The most Honorable Tragedy of Sir Richard Grinvile (1595), reprinted (1871) by Professor E. Arber, a prolix and euphuistic poem in eight-lined stanzas on Sir Richard Grenville; * 1595: The Poem of Poems, or Syon's Muse, dedicated to Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Philip Sidney; * 1597: Devoreux, Virtue's Tears; * 1600: The Teares of the Beloved and Mary Magdalene's Tears (1601), long and rather commonplace poems on the Passion and Resurrection of Christ, both reprinted by Dr. A. B. Grosart in the Miscellanies of the Fuller Worthies Library (1871); * 1602: A translation of the satires of Lodovico Ariosto; * 1607: Cavelarice, or The English horseman, featuring secrets of William Bankes, master of the performing horse Marocco; * 1607: The English Arcadia, part 1. A sequel to Sidney's Arcadia. Part 2 appeared in 1613; * 1608: The Dumb Knight, a comedy, with Lewis Machin; * 1615: The English Huswife; * 1621: Hungers Preuention: or The Whole Art of Fowling By Water and Land London, Anne Holme and Thomas Langley * 1622: Herod and Antipater, a Tragedy, written with William Sampson; * 1624: Honor in his Perfection, in praise of the earls of Oxford, Southampton and Essex; * 1625: Soldier's Accidence turns his military experiences to account; * 1634: The Art of Archerie, Shewing how it is most necessary in these times for this Kingdom, both in Peace and War, and how it may be done without Charge to the Country, Trouble to the People, or any Hindrance to Necessary Occasions. Also, of the Discipline, the Postures, and whatsoever else is necessary for the attaining to the Art (London, Ben Fisher, at the Signe of the Talbot without Alders Gate, 1634) Markham edited the Book of Saint Albans sometimes attributed to Juliana Berners, under the title of The Gentleman's Academy (1595).

It is made using appropriate forms of the expression to be going to.Fleischman, Suzanne, The Future in Thought and Language, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1982. It is an alternative to other ways of referring to the future in English, such as the future construction formed with will (or shall) ‚Äì in some contexts the different constructions are interchangeable, while in others they carry somewhat different implications. Constructions analogous to the English going-to future are found in some other languages, including French and Spanish. Origin The going-to future originated by the extension of the spatial sense of the verb go to a temporal sense (a common change, the same phenomenon can be seen in the preposition before). The original construction involved physical movement with an intention, such as \\"I am going [outside] to harvest the crop.\\" The location later became unnecessary, and the expression was reinterpreted to represent a near future. The colloquial form gonna and the other variations of it as mentioned in the following section result from a relaxed pronunciation of going to. They can provide a distinction between the spatial and temporal senses of the expression: \\"I'm gonna swim\\" clearly carries the temporal meaning of futurity, as opposed to the spatial meaning of \\"I'm going [in order] to swim\\", or \\"I'm going [in the pool] to swim\\". Formation The going-to idiom, used to express futurity is a semi-modal verb that consists of a form of the copula verb be, the word going followed by the word \\"to\\", for instance is going to. Like other modals, it is followed by the base infinitive of the main verb (compare with \\"ought to\\".) (An alternative description is that it uses the verb go in the progressive aspect, most commonly in present progressive form, serving as an auxiliary verb and having the to-infinitive phrase as its complement. However this description fails to take into account sentences in which the main verb is elided, such as \\"Yes, he's going to.\\") It can be put into question and negative forms according to the normal rules of English grammar. Some examples: *The boys are going to fight. (subject the boys + copula are + going to\\" + base-infinitive fight) *I'm going to try the wine. (subject I + copula am + going to' + base-infinitive phrase try the wine) *He's not going to make it. (negative form, copula negated with the addition of not) *Are you going to bring Sue? (interrogative form, featuring subject‚Äìauxiliary inversion) *Aren't they (more formal: Are they not) going to wear coats? (negative interrogative form) *We were going to tell you earlier. (past form of the going-to future, formed with the past copula were) *Yes I'm going to. (main verb is elided). The going to of this future construction is frequently contracted in colloquial English to (be) gonna, and in some forms of English the copula may also be omitted. Hence \\"You're going to like it\\" could be said as \\"You're gonna like it\\" or just \\"You gonna like it\\". In the first person, I'm gonna may further contract to I'm'n'a or Imma , or frequently . (For derived forms found in English-based creole languages, see below.) This is true even when the main verb is elided, as in \\"Yes, I'm/you're/etc. gonna (do that).\\" That the verb go as used in this construction is distinct from the ordinary lexical verb go can be seen in the fact that the two can be used together: \\"I'm going to go to the store now.\\" Also the lexical use of going to is not subject to the contractions to gonna and similar: \\"I'm gonna get his autograph\\" clearly implies the future meaning (intention), and not the meaning \\"I'm going [somewhere] [in order] to get his autograph.\\" Usage The going-to future is one of several constructions used in English to refer to future events (see ). The basic form of the going-to construction is in fact in the present tense; it is often used when the speaker wishes to draw a connection between present events, situations, or intentions and expected future events or situations, i.e. to express the present relevance of the future occurrence.Fleischman, pp. 18‚Äì19 and 95‚Äì97. It may therefore be described as expressing prospective aspect, in the same way that the present perfect (which refers to the present relevance of past occurrences) is said to express retrospective (or perfect) aspect. There is no clear delineation between contexts where going to is used and those where other forms of future expression (such as the will/shall future, or the ordinary present tense) are used. Different forms are often interchangeable. Some general points of usage are listed below. *The going-to future is relatively informal; in more formal contexts it may be replaced by the will/shall future, or by expressions such as plan(s) to, expect(s) to, is/are expected to, etc. *The ordinary present tense can be used to refer to the future when the context (or time adverbs) indicate futurity, and the reference is to some planned action: \\"We are painting the house tomorrow\\" (this could also be expressed with \\"... going to paint ...\\"). It is usually the present progressive that is used, as in the preceding example, but the simple present can also be used, particularly for precisely scheduled events: \\"My train leaves at 4.15.\\" (See also the obligatory use of present tense with future meaning in some dependent clauses.) *When the expression of futurity is combined with that of some modality, such as obligation or possibility, a modal verb (not marked specifically for the future) may be used: \\"We must/can do it tomorrow.\\" There is also the expression am to etc., which implies obligation or expectation as in \\"He is to deliver it this afternoon\\" (see the following section), and the expression to be about to (also to be on the point of and similar), implying immediacy (\\"I am about to leave\\"). *The going-to form sometimes indicates imminence, but sometimes does not; and it sometimes indicates intention, but sometimes does not (compare \\"It's going to rain\\", which expresses imminence but not intention, and \\"I'm going to visit Paris someday\\", which expresses intention but not imminence).Fleischman, pp. 86‚Äì89. *The will future is often used for announcing a decision at the time when it is made, while going to is more likely for a plan already in existence: compare \\"All right, I'll help her\\" and \\"Yes, I'm going to help her\\". *The will future is used more often than going to in conditional sentences of the \\"first conditional\\" type: \\"If it rains, youll get wet\\" (although going to is also sometimes found in such sentences). *In some contexts the going-to form can express unconditionality while the will form expresses conditionality (\\"Don't sit on that rock, it's going to fall\\" means it's going to fall regardless of what you do, while \\"Don't sit on that rock, it will fall\\" means that it will fall conditional on your sitting on it). But in some contexts (particularly with \\"future in the past\\" ‚Äì see the following section) the reverse can be true (\\"After 1962 ended, I would be a star\\" unconditionally describes what subsequently did happen, while \\"After 1962 ended, I was going to be a star\\" describes only intention).Fleischman, p. 92. The be + to construction English has a construction formed by a form of the copula be followed by to and the bare infinitive of the main verb (i.e. the copula followed by the to- infinitive). This is similar in form to the going-to future, with the omission of the word going. In the be + to construction only finite, indicative (or past subjunctive) forms of the copula can appear ‚Äì that is, the copula used cannot be itself, but one of the forms am, is, are, was, were (possibly contracted in some cases). The meaning of this construction is to indicate that something is expected to happen at a future time (usually in the near future), as a result of either some duty (deontic modality) or some set plan. For example: * Im to report to the principal this afternoon. (duty) * The Prime Minister is to visit the West Bank. (plan) * Troops are to be sent to war-torn Darfur. (plan; note passive voice) In headline language the copula may be omitted, e.g. \\"Prime Minister to visit West Bank\\". Compared with the will future, the be + to construction may be less expressive of a prediction, and more of the existence of a plan or duty. Thus \\"John will go ...\\" implies a belief on the speaker's part that this will occur, while \\"John is to go ...\\" implies knowledge on the speaker's part that there exists a plan or obligation entailing such an occurrence (the latter statement will not be falsified if John ends up not going). The be + to construction may therefore resemble a renarrative mood in some ways. When was or were is used as the copula, the plan or duty is placed in past time (and quite often implies that it was not carried out). It may also be used simply as a way of expressing \\"future in the past\\" (see the following section). For example: ::I was to visit my aunt, but I missed the train. (past plan, not in fact fulfilled) ::This was the battle at which they were finally to triumph. (future in the past, also: they would finally triumph) The construction also appears in condition clauses: ::If you are to go on holiday, you need to work hard. (i.e. working hard is necessary for going on holiday) ::If he was/were to speak, it would change things significantly. (also if he spoke) When the verb in such a clause is were, it can be inverted and the conjunction if dropped: \\"Were he to speak, ...\\" For details of these constructions, see English conditional sentences. Expressions of relative future The going-to construction, as well as other constructions used in English refer to future events, can be used not only to express the future relative to the present time, but also sometimes to express the future relative to some other time of reference (see relative tense).Fleischman, p. 65. Some reference points appear more suitable for use in relative future than others. The following are universally attested: *Future relative to a reference point is formed using the past tense of the copula, e.g. \\"I was going to eat dinner\\" (instead of the present \\"I am going to eat dinner\\"). This may express past intention (\\"I was going to eat dinner\\") or prediction (\\"It was going to rain\\"). *Ongoing intention or prediction existing up to the present time is also attested, based on the present perfect progressive of the copula. For example, \\"I have been going to do it for some time\\" (but I haven't gotten around to it) or \\"It has been going to rain all afternoon\\" (but it hasn't started). Similar sentences can be formed on the past perfect progressive (e.g. \\"I had been going to eat\\"). *Future relative to a past subjunctive is attested in a condition clause: \\"If I was/were going to eat...\\" The following relative futures are more nebulous: *Future event relative to a future reference point. In theory, one could string two going-to futures together (\\"I'm going to be going to eat\\"), or, to more easily disambiguate them, use the modular future for the reference point (\\"I will be going to eat\\"). A strong example might be one that incorporates the precise difference in time between the reference point and the event: \\"We can't visit Louise in June, because she'll be going to have a baby three weeks from then.\\" **However, it is not clear that English speakers would agree on the naturalness of this construction or on the interpretation. In fact, some have argued that such a construction does not occur in English or other natural languages with the intended meaning; the latter \\"going to\\" in these constructions may signify the main verb to go as in \\"to move from one place to another.\\" **Others have speculated about this grammatical lacuna. Hans Reichenbach's scheme of tenses identifies a sequence S-R-E, i.e. speech act followed by reference point followed by event, but it does not correspond to an English tense in a strict sense. Latin had a form that may have corresponded to this use, e.g. in the phrase \\"abiturus ero\\", which could be translated \\"I shall be one of those who will leave.\\" Other authors have argued that the future of the future is \\"not attested in natural languages.\\" The South Indian language Kannada has a posterior future tense that might correspond to this usage, but reportedly denotes \\"to need to.\\" **Some have speculated that the lacuna, if it exists, may have a semantic origin; that is, the future is already difficult to specify, and there is simply little occasion in human experience for using a future event as a reference point for a further future event. *Future relative to a hypothetical (conditional) state: \\"I would be going to eat.\\" A similar interpretation to future relative to future may arise instead: \\"I would be going (on my way) to eat.\\" *Future relative to unspecified time: the infinitive (or occasionally present subjunctive) of the copula can be used, e.g. \\"To be going to die is not a good feeling.\\" The infinitive can be used in a variety of constructions, in line with the normal uses of the English infinitive; for example, \\"He is said to be going to resign.\\" Speakers may differ on the interpretation of such constructions. Relative future is also possible for a limited number of uses of the modular \\"will\\" or \\"shall\\" in their so-called past tense forms, respectively \\"would\\" and \\"should\\" (see future in the past). Periphrastic phrases may be able to express some relative future meanings that are otherwise unattested. For example, the phrase \\"to be about to\\" means that in the very near future, one will do something. Hence, \\"I will be about to leave\\" expresses a future event relative to a future reference point. Another construction, \\"to be to\\", also has similar denotations in some constructions, e.g. \\"I was to see the Queen the next day.\\" However, its use is restricted to simple finite forms of the copula, namely the present indicative (\\"I am to do it\\"), the past indicative (\\"I was to do it\\"), and the past subjunctive (\\"if I were to do it\\" or \\"were I to do it\\"; these last have somewhat different implications, as described at English conditional sentences). Related forms in creoles Some creole languages have a marker of future time reference (or irrealis mood) modeled on the verb \\"go\\" as found in the going-to future of the English superstrate.Holm, John, An Introduction to Pidgins and Creoles, Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 188. Examples include Jamaican English CreoleHolm, pp. 93‚Äì95. /de go hapm/ \\"is going to happen\\", /mi a go …πon/ \\"I am going to run\\", Belizean Creole English /gwein/ or /gou…≤/, Gullah Uh gwine he'p dem \\"I'm going to help them\\", Hawaiian Creole EnglishSakoda, Kent, and Siegel, Jeff, Pidgin Grammar, Bess Press, 2003, pp. 38, 55-72. /Ai gon bai wan pickup/ \\"I gonna buy one pickup\\", /Da gai sed hi gon fiks mi ap wit wan blain deit/ \\"The guy said he gonna fix me up with one blind date\\", and Haitian CreoleTurnbull, Wally R., Creole Made Easy, Light Messages, 2000, p. 13. /Mwen va fini/ \\"I go finish\\". Analogous forms in other languages Similarly to English, the French verb aller (\\"to go\\") can be used as an auxiliary verb to create a near-future tense (le futur proche).Fleischman, pp. 98-99. For example, the English sentence \\"I am going to do it tomorrow\\" can be translated by Je vais le faire demain (literally \\"I go it to do tomorrow\\"; French does not have a distinct present progressive form, so je vais stands for both \\"I go\\" and \\"I am going\\"). As in English, the French form can generally be replaced by the present or future tense: Je le fais demain (\\"I am doing it tomorrow\\") or Je le ferai demain (\\"I will do it tomorrow\\"). Likewise, the Spanish verb ir (\\"to go\\") can be used to express the future: Mi padre va a llegar ma√±ana (\\"My father is going to arrive tomorrow\\"). Here the preposition a is used, analogous to the English to; the French construction does not have this. In Welsh, a Brittonic and Celtic language, the verb mynd (\\"to go\\") is used much like the English verb go. In the sentence dw i'n mynd i wneud e yfory (\\"I am going to do it tomorrow\\") mynd is followed by the preposition i (\\"to, for\\") which is itself followed by the verb gwneud (\\"to do\\") in mutated form (hence the missing initial 'g'). This forms a going-to future as found in English.

Life and Work Very little is known about Juliana Berners, and that which is known cannot be verified with certainty. She was the author of treatises on field sports, such as hunting, and many people credit her with the entirety of The Boke of Saint Albans. A facsimile of The Boke of Saint Albans, published in 1810 by Joseph Haslewood, contains an introduction which examines the authorship of the book and the biography of Juliana Berners. Unfortunately, this introduction is largely speculative. Based on her last name, scholars suggest that she was either the daughter of the courtier Sir James Berners or wife to the lord of the manor of Julians Barnes. Whatever family she came from, it is likely that she was high-born and well-educated. It is generally believed that she entered the monastic life and became the prioress of Sopwell Nunnery near St Albans. How and when she joined the nunnery is unknown. Since she was most likely brought up at court, she no doubt hunted and fished with other fashionable court ladies. After she adopted the monastic life, she probably retained her love of hawking, hunting and fishing, and her passion for field sports, which led her to write her treatise on hunting and perhaps others. These treatises are remarkable in the fact that they are some of the earliest extant writings of their kind, as well as in their vision and insight. They include remarks on the virtues of environmental conservation and on etiquette for field sports, concepts which would not become commonly accepted for hundreds of years after the publication of these treatises. Though so little is known about her life, and her claim to the authorship of The Boke of Saint Albans cannot be absolutely verified, numerous women's fly-fishing clubs in Europe and the United States are named for Berners. She is remembered as one of the first authors (of any gender) to write on hunting and angling. The Boke of St. Albans The first and rarest edition of The Boke of Saint Albans was printed in 1486 by an unknown schoolmaster at St Albans. It has no title-page. The only clue to the authorship of the Treatise, and the only documentary evidence of her, is an attribution at the end of the original 1486 book that reads: \\"Explicit Dam Julyans Barnes in her boke of huntyng.\\" Her name was changed by Wynkyn de Worde to \\"Dame Julyans Bernes.\\" There is no such person to be found in the pedigree of the Berners family, but there is a gap in the records of the priory of Sopwell between 1430 and 1480. De Worde's edition (fol. 1496), also without a title-page, begins: \\"This present boke shewyth the manere of hawkynge and huntynge: and also of diuysynge of Cote armours. It shewyth also a good matere belongynge to horses: wyth other comendable treatyses. And ferdermore of the blasynge of armys: as hereafter it maye appere.\\" This edition was adorned by three woodcuts, and included a Treatyse of fysshynge wyth an Angle, not contained in the St Albans edition. When Joseph Haslewood published a facsimile of Wynkyn de Worde's edition with a biographical and bibliographical notice, examined with the greatest care the author's claims to figure as the earliest woman author in the English language. He assigned to her little else in the Boke except part of the treatise on hawking and the section on hunting. It is stated at the end of the Blasynge of Armys that the section was \\"translatyd and compylyt,\\" and it is likely that the other treatises are translations, probably from the French. Only three perfect copies of the first edition are known to exist. A facsimile, entitled The Boke of St Albans, with an introduction by William Blades, appeared in 1881. During the 16th century the work was very popular, and was many times reprinted. It was edited by Gervase Markham in 1595 as The Gentleman's Academie. The treatise on fishing, which was added to the 1496 edition printed by Wynkyn de Worde, and probably had even less to do with Dame Juliana than the original texts, is the earliest known English Language work on fly fishing. More than 150 years later it was an influence on Izaak Walton, another English writer, when he wrote The Compleat Angler.Warner, Charles Dudley (Ed.) (2008) A Library of the World's Best Literature - Ancient and Modern Volume 4, pages 1834‚Äì1836. Cosimo. .Dame Juliana Berners Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved 15 February 2015. An older form of the treatise on fishing was edited in 1883 by Mr T. Satchell from a manuscript in possession of Alfred Denison. This treatise probably dates from about 1450, and formed the foundation of that section in the book of 1496.

Career  In 1840 he was apprenticed to his father's printing business in London, being subsequently taken into partnership. The firm was afterwards known as Blades, East & Blades. His interest in printing led him to make a study of the volumes produced by Caxton's press, and of the early history of printing in England. His Life and Typography of William Caxton, England's First Printer, was published in 1861‚Äì1863, and the conclusions which he set forth were arrived at by a careful examination of types in the early books, each class of type being traced from its first use to the time when, spoilt by wear, it passed out of Caxton's hands. Some 450 volumes from the Caxton Press were thus carefully compared and classified in chronological order. In 1877 Blades took an active part in organizing the Caxton celebration, and strongly supported the foundation of the Library Association. He was a keen collector of old books, prints and medals. His publications relate chiefly to the early history of printing, the Enemies of Books, his most popular work, being produced in 1880. On his death, his library was acquired by the St Bride Foundation as the initial collection of the library.History (St Bride Library) The architect of the St Bride Foundation building, Robert Cunningham Murray, created a room to house the collection that was a near replica of Blade's original library.  Death  He died at Sutton in Surrey on 27 April 1890.

Life and work  Henry Willobie was the second son of a Wiltshire gentleman of the same name. He matriculated from St John's College, Oxford in December 1591 at the age of sixteen, and is probably the same Henry Willobie who graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Exeter College, Oxford early in 1595. He published Willobie his Avisa in 1594. Willobie may have died before 30 June 1596, when a new edition of Willobie his Avisa was published with the addition of an \\"Apologie\\" by Hadrian Dorrell, a friend of the author, which describes him as \\"now of late gone to God.\\" Dorrell alleges that he found the manuscript of Willobie his Avisa among his friend's papers, which were left in his charge when Willobie departed from Oxford on Her Majesty's service. There is no trace of any Hadrian Dorrell in the historical record, and the name may be a pseudonym, perhaps even for Willobie himself. Several authors have suggested that Willobie was not the real author of the poem. Arthur Acheson suggested that Matthew Roydon may have been the author, arguing that the poem obliquely described Shakespeare's relationship to Jane Davenant, the mother of William Davenant, who later hinted that he was Shakespeare's son. Roydon's authorship was later tentatively endorsed by G. B. Harrison,G. B. Harrison, Willobie His Avisa, 1594, ed, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1966, pp.226‚Äî29. and reasserted by Christopher Hill.Hill, Christopher, Intellectual Origins of the English Revolution (1965), p. 142. M. C. Bradbrook argued that it was a collaborative work written by Walter Raleigh's circle, the so-called School of Night, with which Roydon was associated.M. C. Bradbrook, The School of Night: A Study in the Literary Relationships of Sir Walter Raleigh, Russell & Russell, 1965, p.170. Willobie his Avisa was extremely popular, and passed through numerous editions. In 1596 a writer called Peter Colse produced an replicate named Penelope's Complaint.  Connection with Shakespeare  Willobie his Avisa was licensed for the press by printer John Windet on 3 September 1594. In the printed text, the poem is preceded by two commendatory poems, the second of which, signed \\"Contraria Contrariis; Vigilantius; Dormitanus,\\" contains a reference to Shakespeare's poem The Rape of Lucrece, published four months previously: :\\"Yet Tarquyne pluckt his glistering grape, :And Shake-speare paints poore Lucrece rape.\\" This is the earliest known printed allusion to Shakespeare by name (aside from the title pages of Venus and Adonis and Lucrece). The poem itself concerns a female character, Avisa (whose name is explained in Dorrell's \\"Epistle to the Reader\\" as an acronym for Amans Uxor Inviolata Semper Amanda). Avisa tells a story alternately with her suitors, one of whom is introduced to the reader in a prose interlude signed by the author as \\"Henrico Willobego Italo Hispalensis\\". This passage contains a reference which may be to Shakespeare. It runs as follows ('H.W.' refers to Willobie, and 'A' to Avisa): :\\"H. W. being suddenly infected with the contagion of a fantastical fit, at the first sight of A, ... bewrayeth the secresy of his disease unto his familiar frend W. S., who not long before had tried the courtesy of the like passion, and was now newly recovered ... he determined to see whether it would sort to a happier end for this new actor, than it did for the old player.\\" (spelling modernized) Then follows a dialogue between H. W. and W. S., in which the latter gives somewhat commonplace advice to the disconsolate wooer. The use of the word \\"actor\\" and \\"player\\" in connection with the initials 'W.S.' is suggestive that the latter may refer to Shakespeare. If so, and if the poem is autobiographical, it implies that Willobie was in love with a woman who had been previously involved with Shakespeare.

Opera, Lieder and oratorio in German, Italian or English came alike to him, yet he brought to each a precision and individuality that bespoke his perceptive insights into the idiom at hand.\\" In addition, he recorded in French, Russian, Hebrew, Latin and Hungarian. He was described as \\"one of the supreme vocal artists of the 20th century\\"Ted Libbey. The NPR Listener's Encyclopedia of Classical Music New York: Workman Publishing, 2006 and \\"the most influential singer of the 20th Century\\".The Guardian, May 2005 Fischer-Dieskau was ranked the second greatest singer of the century (after Jussi Bj√∂rling) by Classic CD (United Kingdom) \\"Top Singers of the Century\\" Critics' Poll (June 1999). The French dubbed him \\"Le miracle Fischer-Dieskau\\" and Dame Elisabeth Schwarzkopf called him \\"a born god who has it all.\\"Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau: the Baritone of Our Age by Richard Wigmore 6 June 2007 At his peak, he was greatly admired for his interpretive insights and exceptional control of his soft, beautiful instrument. Despite the small size of his lyric/chamber baritone voice, Fischer-Dieskau also performed and recorded a great many operatic roles. He dominated both the opera and concert platforms for over thirty years.Matthew Boyden. The Rough Guide to Opera 3rd Edition London: Rough Guides Ltd., 2002 Early years Albert Dietrich Fischer was born in 1925 in Berlin to Albert Fischer, a school principal, and Theodora (n√©e Klingelhoffer) Fischer, a teacher. In 1934, his father added the hyphenated \\"Dieskau\\" to the family name (through his mother, he was descended from the Kammerherr von Dieskau, for whom Johann Sebastian Bach wrote the \\"Peasant Cantata\\"). He started singing as a child and began formal voice lessons at the age of 16. When he was drafted into the Wehrmacht during World War II in 1943, tending horses on the Russian Front, Fischer-Dieskau had just completed his secondary school studies and one semester at the Berlin Conservatory. He served in Grenadier Regiment 146 of the 65th Infantry Division south of Bologna in the winter of 1944-45 and entertained his comrades at soldiers' evenings behind the lines.Velten, Wilhelm. Vom Kugelbaum zur Handgranate. p. 176. He was captured in Italy in 1945 and spent two years as an American prisoner of war. During that time, he sang Lieder in POW camps to homesick German soldiers. He had an infirm brother who was sent to an institution by the Nazi regime and starved to death. His family home was also destroyed during the war. Singing career In 1947, Fischer-Dieskau returned to Germany where he launched his professional career as a singer in Badenweiler, singing in Brahms' Ein Deutsches Requiem without any rehearsal. (He was a last-minute substitute for an indisposed singer.) He gave his first Lieder recital in Leipzig in the autumn of 1947 and followed it soon afterwards with a highly successful first concert at Berlin's Titania- Palast. From early in his career he collaborated with famous lyric sopranos Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and Irmgard Seefried, and the recording producer Walter Legge, issuing instantly successful albums of Lieder by Schubert and Hugo Wolf. In the autumn of 1948, Fischer-Dieskau was engaged as principal lyric baritone at the St√§dtische Oper Berlin (Municipal Opera, West Berlin), making his debut as Posa in Verdi's Don Carlos under Ferenc Fricsay. This company, known after 1961 as the Deutsche Oper, would remain his artistic home until his retirement from the operatic stage, in 1978. Subsequently, Fischer-Dieskau made guest appearances at the opera houses in Vienna and Munich. After 1949 he made concert tours in the Netherlands, Switzerland, France and Italy. In 1951, he made his Salzburg Festival concert debut with Mahler's Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen (Songs of a Wayfarer) under Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler. That year, he also made his British debut, at the Royal Albert Hall in London during the Festival of Britain. He appeared in Frederick Delius's A Mass of Life, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham.Liner notes to Portrait of Dietriech [sic] Fischer-Dieskau, HMV, released by World Record Club He made regular opera appearances at the Bayreuth Festival between 1954 and 1961 and at the Salzburg Festival from 1956 until the early 1970s. As an opera singer, Fischer-Dieskau performed mainly in Berlin and at the Bavarian State Opera in Munich. He also made guest appearances at the Vienna State Opera, at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London, at the Hamburg State Opera, in Japan, and at the King's Theatre in Edinburgh, during the Edinburgh Festival. His first tour in the United States took place in 1955, when he was 29, with his concert debut in Cincinnati on 15 April (J. S. Bach's cantata Ich will den Kreuzstab gerne tragen ) (BWV 56) and 16 April (Ein Deutsches Requiem). His American Lieder debut, singing Franz Schubert songs, took place in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on 19 April. His New York City debut occurred on 2 May at The Town Hall, where he sang Schubert's song cycle Winterreise without an interval. Both American recitals were accompanied by Gerald Moore. In 1951, Fischer-Dieskau made his first of many recordings of Lieder with Gerald Moore at the EMI Abbey Road Studios, London, including a complete Die sch√∂ne M√ºllerin, and they performed the work on 31 January 1952 at the Kingsway Hall, London in the Mysore Concerts of the Philharmonia Concert Society.Concert Programme, 31 January 1952. They gave recitals together until Moore retired from public performance in 1967. They continued, however, to record together until 1972, in which year they completed their massive project of recording all of the Schubert lieder appropriate for the male voice. Gerald Moore retired completely in 1972, and died in 1987, aged 87. Their recordings of Die sch√∂ne M√ºllerin and Winterreise are highly prized as examples of their artistic partnership. Fischer-Dieskau also performed many works of contemporary music, including Benjamin Britten (who chose Fischer-Dieskau as the baritone soloist when writing War Requiem), Samuel Barber, Hans Werner Henze, Karl Amadeus Hartmann (who wrote his Gesangsszene for him), Ernst Krenek, Witold Lutos≈Çawski, Siegfried Matthus, Othmar Schoeck, Winfried Zillig, Gottfried von Einem and Aribert Reimann. He participated in the 1975 premiere and 1993 recording of Gottfried von Einem's cantata An die Nachgeborenen, written in 1973 as a commission of the UN, both with Julia Hamari and the Wiener Symphoniker conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini. Beyond his recordings of Lieder and the German opera repertoire, Fischer- Dieskau also recorded performances in the Italian operatic field. His recordings of Verdi's Rigoletto (alongside Renata Scotto and Carlo Bergonzi) and Rodrigo in Verdi's Don Carlos, are probably the most respected of these ventures. (Others, such as the title role in Verdi's Macbeth (with Elena Souliotis), Giorgio Germont in Verdi's La traviata, and Scarpia in Giacomo Puccini's Tosca (with Birgit Nilsson), are not delivered by him with the same degree of effectiveness.) As conductor Ferenc Fricsay put it, \\"I never dreamed I'd find an Italian baritone in Berlin.\\" Retirement Fischer-Dieskau retired from opera in 1978, the year he recorded his final opera, Aribert Reimann's Lear, which the composer had written at his suggestion. He retired from the concert hall as of New Year's Day, 1993, at 67, and dedicated himself to conducting, teaching (especially the interpretation of Lieder), painting and writing books. He still performed as a reciter, reading for example the letters of Strauss to Hugo von Hofmannsthal, read by Gert Westphal, for the Rheingau Musik Festival in 1994; and both performing and recording Strauss's melodrama Enoch Arden. He also became an honorary member of the Robert Schumann Society. Recognition Throughout his career, his musicianship and technique were frequently described as flawless by critics. As Greg Sandow of Opera News put it, \\"Overall, his technique is breath-taking; someone should build a monument to it.\\"Greg Sandow. \\"21 Sides of Fischer-Dieskau\\" Opera News November 2000 As 'the world's greatest Lieder singer' (Time magazine), he regularly sold out concert halls all over the world until his retirement at the end of 1992. The precisely articulated accuracy of his performances, in which text and music were presented as equal partners, established standards that endure today. The current widespread interest in German Romantic art song is mainly due to his efforts. Perhaps most admired as a singer of Schubert Lieder, Fischer-Dieskau had, according to critic Joachim Kaiser, only one really serious competitor ‚Äì himself, as over the decades he set new standards, explored new territories and expressed unanticipated feelings and emotions. > Few artists achieve the level of recognition, admiration and influence of > Fischer-Dieskau, and even fewer live to see that influence realised during > their own lifetime.

Personal life In 1949, Fischer-Dieskau married the cellist Irmgard Poppen. Together they had three sons: Mathias (a stage designer), Martin (a conductor), and Manuel (a cellist with the Cherubini Quartet). Irmgard died in 1963 of complications following childbirth. Afterwards, Fischer-Dieskau was married to the actress Ruth Leuwerik, from 1965 to 1967, and Kristina Pugell, from 1968 to 1975. In 1977 he married the soprano J√∫lia V√°rady. His older brother Klaus Fischer-Dieskau was a notable Berlin choral director who conducted for Fischer-Dieskau several times, including in his only recording of a passion by Heinrich Sch√ºtz in 1961. Fischer-Dieskau smoked during a large part of his career. In an interview with B.Z.-News aus Berlin in 2002 he said, \\"I quit smoking 20 years ago. I smoked for 35 years, and then stopped in a single day.\\" Death On 18 May 2012, Fischer-Dieskau died in his sleep at his home in Berg, Upper Bavaria, ten days before his 87th birthday.

J.L., (Ed.) The Visitations of the County of Devon: Comprising the Heralds' Visitations of 1531, 1564 & 1620, Exeter, 1895, p.661; these arms are displayed on the monument to Nicholas Rowe in Westminster Abbey Nicholas Rowe (; 20 June 1674 ‚Äì 6 December 1718), English dramatist, poet and miscellaneous writer, was appointed Poet Laureate in 1715. His plays and poems were well-received during his lifetime, with one of his translations described as one of the greatest productions in English poetry. He was also considered the first editor of the works of William Shakespeare. Life Nicholas Rowe was born in Little Barford, Bedfordshire, England, son of John Rowe (d. 1692), barrister and sergeant-at-law, and Elizabeth, daughter of Jasper Edwards, on 20 June 1674. His family possessed a considerable estate at Lamerton in Devonshire. His father practised law and published Benlow's and Dallison's Reports during the reign of King James II. The future English Poet Laureate was educated first at Highgate School, and then at Westminster School under the guidance of Richard Busby. In 1688, Rowe became a King's Scholar, which was followed by his entrance into Middle Temple in 1691. His entrance into Middle Temple was decided upon by his father, who felt that Rowe had made sufficient progress to qualify him to study law. While at Middle Temple, he read statutes and reports with proficiency proportionate to the force of his mind, which was already such that he endeavoured to comprehend law, not as a series of precedents, or collection of positive precepts, but as a system of rational government and impartial justice. On his father's death, when he was nineteen, he became the master of an independent fortune. He was left to his own direction, and from that time ignored law to try his hand first at poetry, and then later at writing plays. Rowe acted as under-secretary (1709‚Äì1711) to the Duke of Queensberry when he was principal secretary of state for Scotland. On the accession of George I, Rowe was made a surveyor of customs, and in 1715 he succeeded Nahum Tate as poet laureate. He was also appointed clerk of the council to the Prince of Wales, and in 1718 was nominated by Lord Chancellor Parker as clerk of the presentations in Chancery. He died on 6 December 1718, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. :The inscription on his tomb reads as follows: ::To the Memory of NICHOLAS ROWE Esq: who died in 1718 Aged 45, And of Charlotte his only daughter the wife of Henry Fane Esq; who, inheriting her Father‚Äôs Spirit, and Amiable in her own Innocence & Beauty, died in the 22nd year of her age 1739. ::Thy Reliques, Rowe, to this sad Shrine we trust, and near thy Shakespear place thy honour‚Äôd Bust, Oh next him skill‚Äôed to draw the tender Tear, For never Heart felt Passion more sincere: To nobler sentiment to fire the Brave. For never Briton more disdain‚Äôd a Slave: Peace to the gentle Shade, and endless Rest, Blest in thy Genius, in thy love too blest; And blest, that timely from Our Scene remov‚Äôd Thy Soul enjoys that Liberty it lov‚Äôd. ::To these, so mourn‚Äôd in Death, so lov‚Äôd in Life! The childless Parent & the widow‚Äôd wife With tears inscribes this monument Stone, That holds their Ashes & expects her own. Upon his death his widow received a pension from George I in 1719 in recognition of her husband's translation of Lucan. This verse translation, or rather paraphrase of the Pharsalia, was called by Samuel Johnson one of the greatest productions in English poetry, and was widely read, running through eight editions between 1718 and 1807. Family Rowe was first married to a woman by the name of Parsons (given name is unknown), with whom he had a son John. His second wife was Anne Devenish, and they had a daughter named Charlotte. Daniel Lysons and Samuel Lysons noted that he did not have descendants after his son died childless.Daniel Lysons and Samuel Lysons, \\"General history: Families removed since 1620\\". In Magna Britannia: Volume 6, Devonshire (London, 1822), pp. clxxiii‚Äìccxxv. Works The Ambitious Stepmother, Rowe's first play, produced in 1700 at Lincoln's Inn Fields by Thomas Betterton and set in Persepolis, was well received.Nicholas Rowe as a Link between the Later Restoration Drama and that of the Augustan Age This was followed in 1701 by Tamerlane. In this play the conqueror Timur represented William III, and Louis XIV is denounced as Bajazet. It was for many years regularly acted on the anniversary of William's landing at Torbay. In Dublin in 1712, at a time when political passions were running high, the performance provoked a serious riot. The Fair Penitent (1703), an adaptation of Massinger and Field's The Fatal Dowry, was pronounced by Samuel Johnson as one of the most pleasing tragedies ever written in English. It featured the character of Lothario from The Impertinent Curious Man, a story within a story in Miguel de Cervantes' 1605 novel Don Quixote. As a result of this play, the name became synonymous with a rake (womaniser). Calista is said to have suggested to Samuel Richardson the character of Clarissa Harlowe, as Lothario suggested Lovelace. Samuel Johnson noted of The Fair Penitent that, \\"The story is domestic, and therefore easily received by the imagination, and assimilated to common life; the diction is exquisitely harmonious, and soft or spritely as occasion requires.\\" In 1704, Rowe tried his hand at comedy, producing The Biter at Lincoln's Inn Fields, which was unsuccessful, and Rowe returned to tragedy in Ulysses (1705). According to Johnson, this play was to share the fate of many such plays based on mythological heroes, as, \\"We have been too early acquainted with the poetical heroes to expect any pleasure from their revival\\" The Royal Convert (1707) was a story about a love triangle between two brothers, Hengist and Aribert, and a Christian woman named Ethelinda, who is martyred. The Tragedy of Jane Shore, professedly an imitation of Shakespeare's style, was played at Drury Lane with Anne Oldfield in the title role in 1714. It ran for nineteen nights, and kept the stage longer than any other of Rowe's works. In the play, which consists chiefly of domestic scenes and private distress, the wife is forgiven because she repents, and the husband is honoured because he forgives. The Tragedy of Lady Jane Grey followed in 1715, and as this play was not successful, it was his last foray into the medium. Rowe published the first 18th-century edition of William Shakespeare in six volumes in 1709 (printed by Tonson) and is also considered the first editor of Shakespeare. His practical knowledge of the stage helped him divide the plays into scenes (and sometime acts), with the entrances and exits of the players noted. He also normalised the spelling of names and prefixed each play with a list of the dramatis personae. This 1709 edition was also the first to be illustrated, a frontispiece engraving being provided for each play. Unfortunately, Rowe based his text on the corrupt Fourth Folio, a course which was followed by many later 18th-century editors who followed in his editorial footsteps. Rowe also wrote a short biography of Shakespeare, entitled, Some Account of the Life &c.; of Mr. William Shakespear. Rowe wrote occasional verses addressed to Godolphin and Halifax, adapted some of the odes of Horace to fit contemporary events, and translated the Caract√®res of Jean de La Bruy√®re and the Callipaedia of Claude Quillet. He also wrote a memoir of Boileau prefixed to a translation of the Lutrin. He also wrote a version of Lucan's Pharsalia.

It began in Japan in 1978; since then, its observance has spread to several other Asian nations.  Origin  Valentine's Day was first attempted to be celebrated in Japan in 1936, however it did not begin to be popularly celebrated until the 1970s, giving the day a different observation than in the West. It was primarily an opportunity for girls to show that they like a boy. In 1977, a Fukuoka-based confectionery company, Ishimuramanseido, marketed marshmallows to men on March 14, calling it . White Day was first celebrated in 1978 in Japan. It was started by the National Confectionery Industry Association as an \\"answer day\\" to Valentine's Day on the grounds that men should pay back the women who gave them chocolate and other gifts on Valentine's Day; the committee of the association who came up with the day were all middle-aged men, meeting at Keio Plaza Hotel in Tokyo. Soon thereafter, confectionery companies began marketing white chocolate. Now, men give both white and dark chocolate, as well as other edible and non-edible gifts, such as jewelry or objects of sentimental value, or white clothing like lingerie, to women from whom they received chocolate on Valentine's Day one month earlier. Flowers and other gifts are also given on this day.  Observation  White day is celebrated one month after Valentine's Day, on March 14. In countries which observe White Day, typically Valentine's Day is celebrated by women and girls presenting chocolate gifts (either store-bought or handmade), usually to the other men and boys, as an expression of love, courtesy, or social obligation. On White Day, the reverse happens: men who received a or on Valentine's Day are expected to return the favor by giving gifts to the women. Gift exchanges happen between romantic partners, friends, and coworkers. Traditionally, popular White Day gifts include food like white chocolate, marshmallows, candy, and cookies, and other \\"white\\" accessories like jewelry, bags, lotions, and lingerie.. Nowadays, gifts do not have to be white. Sometimes the term is used to describe the generally recited rule for men that the return gift should be two to three times the worth of the Valentine's gift they received.. In the latter half of the 2010s sales figures indicated a decline in popularity of the observation. It was seen as a result from the reduction of sales of obligation chocolates on Valentines Day. Another reason given for the reduction of popularity is the changing gender roles within Japanese culture. International observation Outside of Japan the practice of giving response gifts one month after Valentines Day has spread internationally. In those cultures, White Day is for the most part observed in a similar manner. Some places where this occurs include China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam. In South Korea, a month after White Day, those who did not receive any gifts, commiserate on Black Day. Generally this is celebrated by those without a partner.

Apprentice and actor Betterton was born in August 1635 in Tothill Street, Westminster.The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol.III, London, Charles Knight, 1847, p.273 He was apprenticed to John Holden, Sir William Davenant's publisher, and possibly later to a bookseller named John Rhodes, who had been wardrobe-keeper at the Blackfriars Theatre. In 1659, Rhodes obtained a license to set up a company of players at the Cockpit Theatre in Drury Lane; and on the reopening of this theatre in 1660, Betterton made his first appearance on the stage. Betterton's talents at once brought him into prominence, and he was given leading parts. On the opening of the new theatre in Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1661, Davenant, the patentee of the Duke's Company, engaged Betterton and all Rhodes's company to play in his The Siege of Rhodes. Also in 1661 he played Prince Alvaro in Davenant's Love and Honour. Betterton, besides being a public favourite, was held in high esteem by Charles II, who sent him to Paris to examine stage improvements there. According to Cibber, after his return to England, it was the first time that the shifting scenes replaced tapestry in an English theatre. In 1662 he married the actress Mary Saunderson (died 1712). She started her professional career playing some major female roles in Shakespeare's plays. She and her husband Thomas Betterton shared the stage in a production of Hamlet, in which she played Ophelia, opposite to Betterton's Hamlet. In the meantime, she was also her husband's consultant and business partner. In an age when the profession of acting was often thought as notorious and indecent, and actors, both male and female were unfairly criticized as whores, the Bettertons were still regarded as respectable. They were invited to teach the children from noble and royal families to perform John Crowne's Calisto, 1675, in the last Stuart court Masque. In appearance he was athletic, slightly above middle height, with a tendency to stoutness; his voice was strong rather than melodious, but in recitation it was used with the greatest dexterity. Pepys, Pope, Steele, and Cibber all bestow lavish praise on his acting. His repertory included a large number of Shakespearian roles, many of them presented in the versions adapted by Davenant, Dryden, Shadwell and Nahum Tate. Even though those adapted versions did not receive critical acclaim, they did not harm or shadow Betterton's acting either. Still, his performances were largely praised. He played Lear opposite Elizabeth Barry's Cordelia in Tate's modified version of Shakespeare's King Lear. Betterton was himself author of several adaptations which were popular in their day. Actor and manager From Davenant's death in 1668, Betterton was the de facto manager and director of the Duke's Company, and from the merger of London's two theatre companies in 1682, he continued to fulfill these functions in the new United Company. Enduring progressively worse conditions and terms in this money-grubbing monopoly (see Restoration spectacular and Restoration comedy), the top actors walked out in 1695 and set up a cooperative company in Lincoln's Inn Fields under Betterton's leadership. The new company opened with the premiere of Congreve's Love for Love with an all-star cast including Betterton as Valentine and Anne Bracegirdle as Angelica. But in a few years the profits fell off; and Betterton, laboring under the infirmities of age and gout, determined to quit the stage. At his benefit performance, when the profits are said to have been over ¬£500, he played Valentine in Love for Love. Betterton's career not only spans the period of Restoration theatre, it also marks its high point. There was a period of time when the size of theatre audience started to reduce, in order to revive people's interest in theatre, he invented new stage machines at Dorset Garden Theatre, transposed The Prophetess into an opera, and introduced French singers and dancers to the Restoration stage. He also built the first permanent theatre fully equipped with Italianate machinery. Additionally, he invested in remodeling the tennis court in the Lincoln's Inn Fields and built a new theatre there, therefore in addition to his salary, he also received a small amount of \\"rent\\" fees for each performance done there. Betterton worked with all of the most significant playwrights of his age and the first generation of English actresses. During his time, with the exception of William Mountfort, who gained a versatility in terms of portraying roles, most of Betterton's contemporary actors deliberately restricted themselves to certain popular character-types. However Betterton had more than 120 different roles from the genres such as heroic drama, Jonsonian comedy, comedies of manners, tragicomedies by Beaumont and Fletcher, and tragedies, comedies and histories by Shakespeare. At the age of seventy-five, he claimed, \\"He was yet learning to be an actor.\\" The first acting guide published in English was The Life of Mr Thomas Betterton, which was mainly a pastiche from French rhetoric manuals with passages borrowed from English plays. Betterson's innovation in scenery and theatre management, and his contributions to theatre making shaped the culture of English theatre. Betterton performed to within fifteen days of his death. Three days before his death at seventy-five, he made his last appearance on the stage in 1710, as Melantius in The Maid's Tragedy. He died shortly afterwards, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. From his debut as an actor in 1659 to his last appearance in 1710, his fifty-year career stretched nearly to the end of Stuart Dynasty. Thomas Betterton's death marks the end of a generation. In popular culture Betterton is portrayed by Tom Wilkinson in the film Stage Beauty. Wilkinson was in his mid 50s at the time, yet the film is set around 1662, when Betterton would have been younger than 30.

Three Green Assembly Members - Cllr. Darren Johnson AM, Cllr. Jenny Jones AM and Victor Anderson - were elected to Top-Up seats. In May 2003, Anderson resigned and was replaced by Lynch. In the 2004 London Assembly election, the Green vote share in the top-up seats election fell from 11.1% in 2000 to 8.37% in 2004, meaning that the party lost their third seat, held by Lynch, leaving Johnson and Jones as the remaining members of the London Assembly Green Group.

In addition, he asked 157 formal questions to the Mayor on a wide range of issues. In 2003, Lynch was the Green Party's candidate at the Brent East by- election, securing 3.1% of the vote (638 votes) and coming fourth.

She became the theatrical idol of her day. Her exquisite acting and ladylike carriage were the delight of her contemporaries, and her beauty and generosity found innumerable eulogists, as well as sneering detractors. Early life and discovery She was born in London, to Anne Gourlaw and William Oldfield, a soldier. Despite her rough economic background, Oldfield must have had a basic education because her biographers recount that she read plays voraciously throughout her youth.Robert Gore-Browne, Gay was the Pit: the Life and Times of Anne Oldfield, Actress (1683‚Äì1730) (London: Max Reinhardt, 1957), p.16. In 1699, she attracted George Farquhar's attention when he overheard her reciting lines from Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher's play The Scornful Lady (1616) in a back room of her tavern. Soon after, she was hired by Christopher Rich to join the cast of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.Robert Gore-Browne, Gay was the Pit: the Life and Times of Anne Oldfield, Actress (1683‚Äì1730) (London: Max Reinhardt, 1957), 18‚Äì9. Career It took nearly a year before she landed her first small role as Candiope in John Dryden's Secret Love; or, The Maiden Queen (1699). After her success in a minor role, she was given the lead in John Fletcher's The Pilgrim (1647).Joanne Lafler, The Celebrated Mrs. Oldfield: the Life and Art of an Augustan Actress (Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1989), 16‚Äì7. However, Oldfield wasn't truly noticed until the summer of 1703 when Susanna Verbruggen's contract was terminated before the company traveled to Bath to perform for Queen Anne and her court.Joanne Lafler, The Celebrated Mrs. Oldfield: the Life and Art of an Augustan Actress (Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1989), 25. Oldfield became one of Drury Lane's leading actresses. Colley Cibber acknowledged that she had as much as he to do with the success of his The Careless Husband (1704), in which she created the part of Lady Modish. Of her portrayal of Lady Townly in his The Provoked Husband (1728), Cibber was to say, \\"that here she outdid her usual Outdoing\\". She also played the title role in Ben Jonson's Epicoene, and Celia in his Volpone. In tragedy, too, she won laurels, and the list of her parts, many of them original, is a long and varied one. London gossip believed there to be rivalries between Oldfield, Anne Bracegirdle, Jane Rogers and Susannah Centlivre, all of whom were supposedly vying for the best roles.Lewis Melville, Stage Favourites of the Eighteenth Century (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday Doran & Company, Inc., 1929), 19‚Äì21 In 1706 Oldfield entered a conflict with the Drury Lane's management over benefits and salary she believed she had been promised, but which the theater refused to provide. Oldfield left and joined the competing acting company at Haymarket Theatre before returning to Drury Lane shortly after with a fresh contract and a new position as joint-sharer of the Drury Lane Theater.Felicity Nussbaum, Rival Queens: Actresses, Performance, and the Eighteenth-Century British Theater (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2010), 51. On a separate occasion, Oldfield was offered to become manager of the Theatre, \\"but her sex was thought to be an objection to that measure\\" thus being asked to name her own terms to stay in her old position, Oldfield received 200 guineas salary, which was ultimately raised to 500 guineas - ensuring Oldfield was the highest paid actress of her time. Anne Oldfield at the Covent Gardens.Edward Fisher, after Jonathan Richardson mezzotint, circa 1760-1785, Personal life Anne Oldfield began a decade-long relationship with Whig politician Arthur Maynwaring sometime around 1700. Despite the fact that previous generations of actresses relied heavily on the patronage of their lovers, Oldfield remained financially independent from Maynwaring.Joanne Lafler, The Celebrated Mrs. Oldfield: the Life and Art of an Augustan Actress (Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1989), 27‚Äì31. He supported her career by helping her work through new roles and by writing more than a dozen prologues and epilogues for her to perform.Nicola Parsons, ‚ÄúMrs. Oldfield,\\" Mary Hays, Female Biography; or, Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women, of All Ages and Countries (1803). Chawton House Library Series: Women‚Äôs Memoirs, ed. Gina Luria Walker, Memoirs of Women Writers Part III. Pickering & Chatto: London, 2013, vol. 10, vol. 10, 30‚Äì3, editorial notes, 548-51, on 550. When she became pregnant with their son, Arthur, Oldfield kept acting until she was physically unable, an unusual decision in a time when most actresses were pressured to take a leave of absence throughout the duration of their pregnancy. She went back to work just three months after the birth.Laura Engel and Elaine M. McGirr, eds, Stage Mothers: Women, Work, and the Theater, 1660‚Äì1830 (Lenham, Maryland: Bucknell University Press, 2014), p. 45-6. In her turn Oldfield arranged for her lifelong friend Margaret Saunders to join the acting profession. When Maynwaring died in 1712, Oldfield was tortured with rumors that he had died from a venereal disease that she had given to him. In order to clear both their names, she ordered an official autopsy to be performed on her former lover's body, which revealed that he had, in fact, died of tuberculosis.Laura Engel and Elaine M. McGirr, eds, Stage Mothers: Women, Work, and the Theater, 1660‚Äì1830 (Lenham, Maryland: Bucknell University Press, 2014), p. 48. Oldfield was three months pregnant at the time, but her child is not believed to have survived the birth.Nicola Parsons, ‚ÄúMrs. Oldfield,\\" Mary Hays, Female Biography; or, Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women, of All Ages and Countries (1803). Chawton House Library Series: Women‚Äôs Memoirs, ed. Gina Luria Walker, Memoirs of Women Writers Part III. Pickering & Chatto: London, 2013, vol. 10, vol. 10, 30‚Äì3, editorial notes, 548-51, on 550. Several years after Maynwaring's death, Oldfield began a relationship with Charles Churchill. The two lived together for many years and had a son, Charles. However, during this pregnancy, Oldfield had many negative side effects and was forced to leave the theater for several months. She never fully recovered her health.Laura Engel and Elaine M. McGirr, eds, Stage Mothers: Women, Work, and the Theater, 1660‚Äì1830 (Lenham, Maryland: Bucknell University Press, 2014), p. 53-4. Throughout her last theatrical season she suffered from chronic pain in her abdomen. She retired from the stage in April 1730 and died from cancer of the uterus a few months later.Joanne Lafler, The Celebrated Mrs. Oldfield: the Life and Art of an Augustan Actress (Carbondale and Edwardsville: Southern Illinois University Press, 1989), p. 162. Memorial Anne Oldfield was the theatrical idol of her day. Her exquisite acting and ladylike carriage were the delight of her contemporaries, and her beauty and generosity found innumerable eulogists, as well as sneering detractors. Alexander Pope, in his Sober Advice from Horace, wrote of her \\"Engaging Oldfield, who, with grace and ease, Could join the arts to ruin and to please.\\" It was to her that he alluded as the lady who detested being buried in woollen, who said to her maid \\"No, let a charming chintz and Brussels lace Wrap my cold limbs and shade my lifeless face; One would not, sure, be frightful when one's dead, And Betty give this cheek a little red.\\" Oldfield was forty-seven when she died on 23 October 1730 at 60 Grosvenor Street, London.English Heritage plaque for Oldfield at plaquesoflondon.co.uk She divided her property, for that time a large one, between her two sons. Oldfield was buried in Westminster Abbey, beneath the monument to Congreve. Her partner, Churchill, applied for permission to erect a monument there to her memory, but the dean of Westminster refused it.Nicola Parsons, ‚ÄúMrs. Oldfield,\\" Mary Hays, Female Biography; or, Memoirs of Illustrious and Celebrated Women, of All Ages and Countries (1803).

Life Her first recorded stage appearance may have been as early as 1681 in D'Urfey's Sir Barnaby Whig. In 1686 she married the actor William Mountfort, and after Mountfort's infamous murder in 1692, she married the actor John Verbruggen. She was a successful and popular comedian, known especially for her breeches roles. Her greatest success was as the main character Lucia in Thomas Southerne's Sir Anthony Love, where Lucia partakes of the freedom of the roistering Restoration rake by disguising herself as \\"Sir Anthony\\". Both men and women in the audience loved her performance in these types of roles. She was one of the leading actresses at the United Company, but when the company split in two in 1695 (see Restoration comedy) she was, however, not offered a share in the actors' cooperative, but merely a salary. This may have been the biggest tactical mistake the actors' company made: both the Verbruggens were dissatisfied with the offer, reasonably so since Susanna was extremely versatile and popular with audiences, and returned to the parent company, thereby substantially improving its odds in the competition between the companies (see The Relapse). He daughter also known as Susanna Mountfort (1690-1720) was also an actress at Drury Lane, beginning her career in 1703.

His first stage appearance was with the Dorset Garden company about 1678, and by 1682 he was taking important parts, usually those of the fine gentleman. Mountfort wrote a number of plays, wholly or in part, and many prologues and epilogues. He married, in 1686, Susanna Percival, the actress. Owing to jealousy of Mrs. Anne Bracegirdle's supposed interest in Mountfort, Captain Richard Hill, an adventurer, who had annoyed her with persistent attentions, accompanied by Charles Mohun, 4th Baron Mohun ambushed Mountfort in Howard Street, Strand, on 9 December 1692. During the struggle Mountfort was stabbed in the chest by Hill, he died of his wounds the following day. Following the attack Hill fled to France. Lord Mohun was tried by his peers and acquitted by a vote of 69 to 14. The bell of St Clement's Church is reputed to have cracked when tolled at Mountfort's funeral. His daughter Susanna Mountfort became an actor at Drury Lane. Works An anthology of his plays, entitled Six Plays, was published by J. Tonson, G. Strahan and William Mears in two volumes (1719-20) accompanied by a preface consisting of some memoirs of his life. The plays were: * The injur'd lovers, or, The Ambitious Father (1688) * The Successful Strangers (1690) * Greenwich Park * King Edward the Third , with the Fall of Mortimer Earl of March (generally attributed to John Bancroft) * The life and death of Dr. Faustus * Henry the Second, King of England, with the Death of Rosamond (generally attributed to John Bancroft) It is believed that his 1705 play Zelmane: Or, The Corinthian Queen: A Tragedy.

It is named after Irving Fisher, who was famous for his works on the theory of interest. In finance, the Fisher equation is primarily used in YTM calculations of bonds or IRR calculations of investments. In economics, this equation is used to predict nominal and real interest rate behavior. Letting denote the real interest rate, denote the nominal interest rate, and let denote the inflation rate, a linear approximation, but the Fisher equation is often written as an equality: :i = r + \\\\pi The Fisher equation can be used in either ex-ante (before) or ex-post (after) analysis. Ex-post, it can be used to describe the real purchasing power of a loan: :r = i - \\\\pi Rearranged into an expectations augmented Fisher equation and given a desired real rate of return and an expected rate of inflation (with superscript meaning \\"expected\\") over the period of a loan, it can be used as an ex-ante version to decide upon the nominal rate that should be charged for the loan: :i = r + \\\\pi^e This equation existed before Fisher,https://archive.org/details/appreciationinte00fishhttp://www.policonomics.com/irving- fisher/http://199.169.211.101/publications/research/economic_review/1983/pdf/er690301.pdf but Fisher proposed a better approximation which is given below. The approximation can be derived from the exact equation: :1 + i = (1 + r)(1 + \\\\pi). Derivation Although time subscripts are sometimes omitted, the intuition behind the Fisher equation is the relationship between nominal and real interest rates, through inflation, and the percentage change in the price level between two time periods. So assume someone buys a $1 bond in period while the interest rate is . If redeemed in period , the buyer will receive dollars. However, if the inflation rate at is anticipated to be , then the present value of the proceeds from the bond is , which is equivalent to the real growth at as given by . Hence, :(1+r_{t+1}) = \\\\frac{1+i_t}{1+\\\\pi_{t+1}} From here the nominal interest rate can be solved for. :\\\\begin{align} 1 + i_t &= \\\\left (1 + r_{t+1} \\\\right ) \\\\left (1 + \\\\pi_{t+1} \\\\right ) \\\\ &= 1 + r_{t+1} + \\\\pi_{t+1} + r_{t+1} \\\\pi_{t+1} \\\\end{align} Therefore, :\\\\begin{align} i_t &= r_{t+1} + \\\\pi_{t+1} + r_{t+1} \\\\pi_{t+1} \\\\ &\\\\approx r_{t+1} + \\\\pi_{t+1} \\\\end{align} The last line follows from the assumption that both real interest rates and the inflation rate are fairly small, (perhaps on the order of several percent, although this depends on the application) therefore is much larger than and so can be dropped. More formally, this linear approximation is given by using two 1st order Taylor expansions, namely: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{1}{1+x} &\\\\approx 1-x,\\\\ (1+x)(1+y) &\\\\approx 1+x+y. \\\\end{align} Combining these yields the approximation: :1+r= \\\\frac{1+i}{1+\\\\pi} \\\\approx (1+i)(1-\\\\pi) \\\\approx 1+i-\\\\pi, and hence :r \\\\approx i - \\\\pi. These approximations, valid only for small changes, can be replaced by equalities, valid for any size changes, if logarithmic units are used. Applications=Cost‚Äìbenefit analysis As detailed by Steve Hanke, Philip Carver, and Paul Bugg (1975), cost benefit analysis can be greatly distorted if the exact Fisher equation is not applied. Prices and interest rates must both be projected in either real or nominal terms. For the purpose of cost‚Äìbenefit analysis inflation can be consistently handled in either of two ways. First, when calculating the present value of expected net benefits, prices and interest rates can be calculated in real terms. That is, no inflationary components are included in either the prices or the interest rates. The second approach includes inflation in both the price and the interest rate calculations; calculations are made in nominal terms. As detailed below, both approaches are equivalent as long as both prices and interest rates are projected in real terms, or both projected in nominal terms. For example, assume that represents the undiscounted expected net benefits at the end of year , evaluated at constant prices, and , and are the real rate of interest, the expected rate of inflation, and the nominal rate of interest for year , respectively. The present value of the expected net benefits is given by :\\\\text{PVNB} = \\\\frac{Z_1}{1+R_1} + \\\\frac{Z_2}{(1+R_1)(1+R_2)} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{Z_n}{(1+R_1) \\\\cdots (1+R_n)} where no inflation components are included in either prices or the interest rate. Alternatively, the present value of expected net benefits is given by :\\\\text{PVNB} = \\\\frac{Z_1(1+I_1)}{1+r_1} + \\\\frac{Z_2(1+I_1)(1+I_2)}{(1+r_1)(1+r_2)} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{Z_n(1+I_1)\\\\cdots(1+I_n)}{(1+r_1)\\\\cdots(1+r_n)} or through the relationship dictated by the exact Fisher equation : \\\\begin{align} \\\\text{PVNB} & = \\\\frac{Z_1(1+I_1)}{(1+R_1)(1+I_1)} + \\\\frac{Z_2(1+I_1)(1+I_2)}{(1+R_1)(1+R_2)(1+I_1)(1+I_2)} + \\\\cdots [8pt] & {}\\\\qquad \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{Z_n(1+I_1)\\\\cdots (1+I_n)}{(1+R_1) \\\\cdots(1+R_n)(1+I_1)\\\\cdots (1+I_n)} \\\\end{align} By observing the above equations, it is clear that the present value of net benefits derived by either equation will be identical. This alleviates any question concerning whether to conduct cost‚Äìbenefit analysis in terms of constant or nominal prices. Inflation-indexed bonds The Fisher equation has important implications in the trading of inflation-indexed bonds, where changes in coupon payments are a result of changes in break-even inflation, real interest rates and nominal interest rates. Monetary policy The Fisher equation plays a key role in the Fisher hypothesis, which asserts that the real interest rate is unaffected by monetary policy and hence unaffected by the expected inflation rate. With a fixed real interest rate, a given percent change in the expected inflation rate will, according to the equation, necessarily be met with an equal percent change in the nominal interest rate in the same direction.

He is well known for a book that sums up knowledge of Shakespeare available at the time. Biography Drake was apprenticed to a doctor in York in 1780, and in 1786 proceeded to Edinburgh University, where he took his degree as M. D. in 1789. In 1790 he set up as a general practitioner at Sudbury, Suffolk, where he found an intimate friend in John Mason Good (died 1827). In 1792, Drake relocated to Hadleigh, where he died in 1836. Bibliography Drake's works include several volumes of literary essays, and some papers contributed to medical periodicals, but his most important production was Shakespeare and his Times, including the Biography of the Poet, Criticisms on his Genius, and Writings; a new Chronology of his Plays; a Disquisition on the Object of his Sonnets; and a History of the Manners, Customs and Amusements, Superstitions, Poetry and Elegant Literature of his Age (2 vols, 1817). The title adequately indicates the scope of this ample work, which has the merit, says G. G. Gervinus, \\"of having brought together for the first time into a whole the tedious and scattered material of the editions and the many other valuable labours of Tyrwhitt, Heath, Ritson, etc\\". An important medical work of Drake's is On the Use of Digitalis in Consumption (five papers published in the Medical and Physical Journal, London, 1799‚Äì1800). His Literary Hours (1798) were exceedingly popular early in the 19th century (4th ed., 1820). Drake is also credited with discovering the poet Henry Neele.ODNB entry on Neele: Retrieved 12 August 2012. Pay-walled.

He is a wealthy, materialistic Wall Street investment banker who leads a secret life as a serial killer. Bateman has also briefly appeared in other Ellis novels and their film and theatrical adaptations. Biography and profile Bateman, at the beginning of American Psycho is 26 years old, works as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions at the fictional Wall Street investment firm of Pierce & Pierce (also Sherman McCoy's firm in The Bonfire of the Vanities) and lives at 55 West 81st Street, Upper West Side on the 11th floor of the American Gardens Building (where he is a neighbor of actor Tom Cruise). In his secret life, however, Bateman is a serial killer murdering a variety of people, from colleagues to the homeless to prostitutes. His crimes‚Äîincluding rape, torture, necrophilia, and cannibalism‚Äîare described in graphic detail in the novel. Bateman comes from a wealthy family. His parents have a house on Long Island, and he mentions a summer house in Newport. His parents divorced sometime earlier, while his mother became sick and now resides at a sanatorium. His father, who first appeared in Ellis' preceding novel The Rules of Attraction, grew up on an estate in Connecticut, and now owns an apartment in the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan. He is assumed to be dead as he is mentioned only in past tense during the novel. Bateman's younger brother Sean attends Camden College (and is a protagonist of Ellis' previous novel, The Rules of Attraction, in which Patrick Bateman was first introduced). Bateman attended Phillips Exeter Academy for prep school. He graduated from Harvard College in 1984 and Harvard Business School two years later, and moved to New York City. By the end of the novel, he believes he is about to be arrested for murdering a colleague named Paul Allen and leaves a message on his lawyer's answering machine confessing to his crimes. When he runs into his lawyer at a party, however, the man mistakes him for somebody else and tells him that the message must have been a joke, as he had met with Allen only days earlier. Bateman realizes that the punishment and notoriety he desires will be forever out of his reach and that he is trapped inside a pointless existence: \\"This is not an exit\\". Personality As written by Ellis, Bateman is the ultimate stereotype of yuppie greed; rich, shallow, and addicted to sex, drugs, and conspicuous consumption. All of his friends look alike to him, to the point that he often confuses one for another; they often confuse him for other people as well. Bateman takes delight in obsessively detailing virtually every single feature of his designer clothes, workout routine, business cards, alcoholic drinks, elaborate high-end stereo and home theater sound system. He is engaged to an equally rich, shallow woman named Evelyn Williams. He has a mistress on the side named Courtney Lawrence, a woman who is involved in his social circle, and has regular liaisons with prostitutes and women he encounters at clubs, many of whom end up being his victims. The one woman (and possibly the one person) in his life for whom he has anything approaching feelings is his secretary, Jean. He feels that she is the only person in his life who is not completely shallow, so he cannot bring himself to seduce or kill her. He casually acknowledges her as \\"Jean, my secretary who is in love with me\\" and introduces her in the narration as someone whom he \\"will probably end up married to someday\\". Despite his affluence and high social status, Bateman is wracked by feelings of insecurity and self-hatred. He kills many of his victims because they make him feel inadequate, usually by having better taste than he does. He is deeply disliked by others as well - his friends mock him as the \\"boy next door\\"; his own lawyer refers to him as a \\"bloody ass- kisser... a brown-nosing goody-goody\\"; and he is often dismissed as \\"yuppie trash\\" by people outside his social circle. Bateman often expresses doubts regarding his own sanity and he has periodic attacks of psychosis, during which he hallucinates. It is left open to interpretation whether Bateman actually commits the acts he describes, or whether he is merely hallucinating them; he is, therefore, an unreliable narrator. In the climax of the story, Bateman calls his lawyer and leaves a lengthy, detailed message confessing all of his crimes. He later runs into his lawyer, who mistakes him for someone else and dismisses the confession as a joke, also claiming to have had dinner with one of his victims after Bateman had supposedly killed him, leaving the supposed reality of Bateman's acts open to audience interpretation. Although Bateman often claims that he is devoid of emotion, he also describes experiencing moments of extreme rage, panic or grief‚Äîbeing on the \\"verge of tears\\"‚Äîoften over trivial inconveniences such as remembering to return videotapes or trying to obtain dinner reservations. In the middle of dismembering a victim, he breaks down, sobbing that he \\"just wants to be loved\\". He takes psychotropics, like Xanax, to control these emotions. He publicly espouses a philosophy of tolerance, equality and traditional moral values because he thinks it will make him more likeable, however he truly has no interest in any of the afore mentioned principles. Bateman compensates for his insecurities through obsessive vanity and personal grooming, with unwavering attention to detail. He buys the most fashionable, expensive clothing and accessories possible (e.g., Salvatore Ferragamo, Alan Flusser and Valentino suits, Oliver Peoples glasses and Jean Paul Gaultier, Louis Vuitton and Bottega Veneta leather goods) as a means of effecting some \\"control\\" over his otherwise chaotic life. Likewise, he categorizes people by what they wear and how they look because they are more easily \\"understood\\" in terms of labels and stereotypes. Bateman's apartment also is firmly controlled in terms of look and taste, with the latest music, food, and art. Bateman kills more or less indiscriminately, with no preferred type of victim and no consistent or preferred method of killing. Throughout the novel, he kills men, women, animals, and, in one instance, a child. Bateman murders women mostly for sadistic sexual pleasure, often during or just after sex. He kills men because they anger or annoy him or make him feel inferior. In the case of the child, Bateman wished to see if he would enjoy it, but found it unsatisfactory since the child's death would not affect as many people as an adult's would. Periodically, he matter-of-factly confesses his crimes to his friends, co- workers, and even complete strangers (\\"I like to dissect girls, did you know I'm utterly insane\\") just to see if they are actually listening to him. They either are not, or they think that he is joking. Outside American Psycho Bateman made his first appearance in Ellis' 1987 novel The Rules of Attraction (in which Sean, his brother, is a main character); no indication is given that he is a serial killer. Bateman also makes a short appearance in Ellis' 1998 novel Glamorama, with \\"strange stains\\" on the lapel of his Armani suit. Bateman also appeared in the American Psycho 2000 e-mails (transcribed here), which were written as an advertisement campaign for the movie. Although they are often mistakenly credited to Ellis, they were actually written by one or more unnamed authors and approved by Ellis before being sent out. American Psycho 2000 served as a sort of \\"e-quel\\" to the original novel. The e-mails take place in 2000, a little over a decade since the novel. Bateman is in psychotherapy with a Dr. M. He is also married to Jean, his former secretary. They have a son, Patrick Bateman Jr. (P.B.), who is eight years old. In the story, Bateman talks about therapy, trying to get a divorce from Jean, his renewed feelings about murder, and idolizing his son. In the end, it is revealed that the 'real' Bateman, who 'writes' the e-mails, is the owner of the company that produces the movie. Bateman appeared in Ellis's 2005 novel Lunar Park, in which the fictionalised Bret Easton Ellis confesses that writing American Psycho felt like channeling the words of a violent spirit rather than writing anything himself. This ghost‚ÄîBateman‚Äîhaunts Ellis's home. A character also comes to Ellis's Halloween party dressed as Patrick Bateman, and a copycat killer is seemingly patterning himself on Bateman. Toward the novel's end, Ellis writes the 'last' Bateman story as a way of confronting and controlling the character, as well as the issues Ellis created Bateman as a means of countering. Bateman, for all intents and purposes, dies in a fire on a boat dock. In the Showtime series Dexter, protagonist Dexter Morgan, himself a serial killer, uses the alias \\"Dr. Patrick Bateman\\" to acquire M-99 for the use of incapacitating his victims. There is a recurring character in the video game Criminal Case named Christian Bateman (a combination of the names Christian Bale and Patrick Bateman) modeled after the character. In film and on stage Though Christian Bale had been the first choice for the part by both Ellis and Harron, the producers offered the part to Keanu Reeves, Edward Norton, and Brad Pitt. Leonardo DiCaprio was set to play the character, but Ellis (as explained in the American Psycho DVD) decided he would appear too young, especially immediately after Titanic. In addition, his managers thought the role was \\"too violent\\" and could potentially hurt his career. Bateman was also portrayed by Dechen Thurman, a brother of Uma Thurman, in the 2000 documentary This Is Not an Exit: The Fictional World of Bret Easton Ellis. Michael Kremko played Bateman in the spin-off American Psycho 2, in which the character is killed by a would-be victim. Aside from the character appearing in the film, the sequel has no other connection to the previous film and has been denounced by Ellis. Scenes with the character were shot for the 2002 film adaptation of The Rules of Attraction. Ellis revealed in an interview that director Roger Avary asked Bale to reprise the role, but Bale turned down the offer, and Avary asked Ellis himself to portray Bateman. Ellis refused, stating that he \\"thought it was such a terrible and gimmicky idea\\", and Avary eventually shot the scenes with Casper Van Dien. The scenes, however, were ultimately cut from the final version of the film. In a 2009 interview with Black Book, director Mary Harron said, \\"We talked about how Martian-like [the character] Patrick Bateman was, how he was looking at the world like somebody from another planet, watching what people did and trying to work out the right way to behave, and then one day [Christian] called me and he had been watching Tom Cruise on David Letterman, and he just had this very intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes, and he was really taken with this energy.\\" Doctor Who star Matt Smith played the role in the 2013 stage musical version of the novel, with music and lyrics by Duncan Sheik and a book by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, at London's Almeida Theatre. In 2016, Benjamin Walker portrayed Bateman in a Broadway production of the musical, which ran from March 21-June 5, 2016. Chronology *October 1962: Patrick Bateman is born.The month can be narrowed down by passages where he briefly muses on what it means to be a Libra, as well as wondering what he will receive for his birthday in October. The year is 1962, derived from the fact that the novel begins in April 1989 and Patrick mentions in the narration that he is 26 years old. *1980: Bateman graduates from Phillips Exeter Academy. *1984: Bateman graduates from Harvard University. *1985: Bateman has a short discussion with his estranged brother Sean about his future. *1986: Bateman graduates from Harvard Business School. **From the time of his graduation, through the end of American Psycho, Bateman works at Pierce & Pierce. *ca. 1996: Bateman shows up at Victor's club in Glamorama with \\"strange stains\\" on his suit. *2000: Bateman enters therapy with a Dr. M. This appears in the American Psycho 2000 e-mails. In these emails, he is divorcing Jean, to whom he has been married for at least five years, and with whom he has a son. He has started his own brokerage firm and seems to be wealthier than he was in the original novel. His tastes are even more refined.

Glen Iris recorded a population of 25,268 at the 2016 Census. Glen Iris has been Melbourne's geographical centre of population since the 1990s. History Captain Thomas Henderson, of the Royal Navy, arrived in Melbourne on a ship called Iris in 1850. He acquired a property bounded by Gardiners Creek, High Street and a line extending Summerhill Road to Gardiners Creek. The property was advertised for sale as Glen Iris, in 1852. Robert Kent, a subsequent owner of the Glen Iris homestead, suggested a Mechanics' Institute be established, but it was never completed. A Wesleyan church was established in 1865 and in 1871 land was granted for an adjacent school (now Glen Iris Primary School). By the 1880s reference was made to the Township of Glen Iris. Glen Iris Post Office opened on 28 August 1890. A Glen Iris Upper Post Office was open from 1947 until 1994. Places of interest A number of government and independent schools are located in Glen Iris, including Camberwell South Primary School, Glen Iris Primary School, St Cecilia's Primary School, St Roch's Catholic Primary School, Sacr√© C≈ìur School, Korowa Anglican Girls' School and Caulfield Grammar School Malvern campus. Recreational and sporting facilities include the Harold Holt Swim Centre, a BMX track at Hill'n'Dale Park, Burwood District Bowls Club and a number of reserves and ovals, including Hartwell Sports Ground, Ferndale Park and T.H. King Oval. The Glen Iris wetlands were established by the former City of Malvern in 1989. Glen Iris Road Uniting Church incorporates part of the original 1865 Wesleyan Church building. The division between the Boroondara and Stonnington municipalities follows the course of Gardiners Creek, which is a tributary of the Yarra River. A tributary of Gardiners Creek, running north through the suburb, Back Creek, has largely been turned into a drain. Also roughly following the course of Gardiners Creek is the Monash Freeway, and the Glen Waverley train line. The Harold Holt Memorial Swimming Centre was built in memory of former Prime Minister Harold holt whose electoral seat was Higgins and included Glen Iris. This pool has led to the amusement of many locals and visitors as they realise a pool was built to commemorate a man who was presumed drowned after going missing, at Cheviot Beach, Portsea in 1967. Transport Two train stations on the Glen Waverley railway line, Gardiner and Glen Iris, are within the suburb. Passing through the eastern part of Glen Iris is the Alamein line, with Burwood Station also within the boundaries of the suburb (Glen Iris did not originally cover this far east, and this station and its surrounds were originally in the suburb of Burwood). Residents are also served by the numbers 5, 6, 72 and 75 tram routes. Melbourne bus routes also service the area.

Madero. His family was politically active and involved. His grandfather, Miguel C. Alatriste, was a strong liberal during the Reform, and served as governor of the state of Puebla in 1857. During the French Intervention, Alatriste fought against the invaders and their Mexican conservative allies, was captured and executed.David G. LaFrance, \\"Aquiles Serd√°n\\" in Encyclopedia or Mexico. vol. 2, p. 1340-41. Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997. His father, Manuel Serd√°n, was one of the founders of the Partido Socialista Mexicano (Mexican Socialist Party), and co-authored La Ley del Pueblo that called for agrarian reform. Manuel Serd√°n disappeared, perhaps murdered by authorities. Aquiles Serd√°n was a shoemaker by trade, as was his father, Manuel Serd√°n. He read Francisco I. Madero's 1909 book, The Presidential Succession of 1910, in which Madero laid out the problems of Mexico under Porfirio D√≠az's rule and called for open elections. Serd√°n corresponded with Madero and organized an Anti-Reelectionist Club in the city of Puebla, joined mainly by textile workers.Stanley R. Ross, Francisco I. Madero: Apostle of Democracy. New York: Columbia University Press 1955, pp. 121-22. He became a revolutionary, opposing D√≠az. Serd√°n was arrested by D√≠az's government, spending October - December 1909 in prison. He actively campaigned for Madero in the 1910 presidential elections, but when Madero was arrested and fraudulent elections held, Serd√°n left for the United States. After the Electoral College declared D√≠az and Ram√≥n Corral victors in the 1910 elections, Serd√°n is reported to have said, \\"Do not intone the hosanna of Victory, Se√±ores Porfiristas and Corralistas, for we Anti-Reelectionists have not yet fired the last cartridge.\\"quoted in Stanley R. Ross, Francisco I. Madero p. 111. When Madero escaped jail in 1910 and issued the Plan of San Luis Potos√≠, which called for rebellion throughout Mexico on November 20, 1910, Serd√°n returned to Puebla to organize revolution there. He and his brother M√°ximo bought arms and raised support from men to bear them. His sister Carmen Serd√°n went to San Antonio, Texas, a center of exiled Mexican revolutionaries, and obtained 20,000 pesos for the rebellion. The D√≠az government got wind of the Serd√°n's revolutionary activities and the Puebla police chief and men under his command came to the Serd√°n family home, where violence ensued on 18 November 1910. Serd√°n, his brother M√°ximo, and his wife, mother, and sister Carmen, along with nine men, defended the house. Although he had hopes that the city of Puebla would rise, it did not and the government forces killed Serd√°n, losing 158 of its own men. When Madero heard of Serd√°n's death, he is reported to have said, \\"It does not matter. They have shown us how to die.\\"quoted in Ross, Francisco I. Madero, p. 123.

Biography Gervinus was born in Darmstadt. He was educated at the gymnasium of the town, and intended for a commercial career, but in 1825 he became a student of the university of Giessen. In 1826 he went to Heidelberg, where he attended the lectures of the historian Schlosser, who became henceforth his guide and his model. In 1828 he was appointed teacher at a private school at Frankfort-on-Main, and in 1830 Privatdozent at Heidelberg. In this period he became a friend of the young historian Karl von Hegel (the son of the Philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel) and of the jurist Georg Beseler. A volume of his collected Historische Schriften procured him the appointment of professor extraordinarius; while the first volume of his Geschichte der poetischen Nationallitteratur der Deutschen (History of the poetical national literature of the Germans; 1835‚Äì1842, 5 vols.) subsequently entitled Geschichte der deutschen Dichtung (History of German poetry; 5th edition, by Karl Bartsch, 1871‚Äì1874) brought him the appointment to a regular professorship of history and literature at G√∂ttingen. This work is the first comprehensive history of German literature written both with scholarly erudition and literary skill. In the following year he wrote his Grundz√ºge der Historik, which is perhaps the most thoughtful of his philosophico-historical productions. First issue of July 1, 1847 of Deutsche Zeitung, a liberal daily issued founded by Georg Gottfried. His grave in Heidelberg The same year brought his expulsion from G√∂ttingen in consequence of his protest, in conjunction with six of his colleagues, against the violation of the constitution by Ernest Augustus, king of Hanover and duke of Cumberland. After several years in Heidelberg, Darmstadt and Rome, he settled permanently in Heidelberg, where, in 1844, he was appointed honorary professor. He zealously took up in the following year the cause of the German Catholics, hoping it would lead to a union of all the Christian confessions, and to the establishment of a national church. He also came forward in 1846 as a patriotic champion of the Schleswig-Holsteiners, and when, in 1847, King Frederick William IV promulgated the royal decree for summoning the so-called United Diet (), Gervinus hoped that this event would form the basis of the constitutional development of the largest German state. He founded, together with some other patriotic scholars, the Deutsche Zeitung, which certainly was one of the best-written political journals ever published in Germany. His appearance in the political arena secured his election as deputy for the Prussian province of Saxony to the National Assembly sitting in 1848 at Frankfort. Disgusted with the failure of that body, he retired from all active political life. Gervinus now devoted himself to literary and historical studies, and between 1849 and 1852 published his work on Shakespeare (4 vols., 4th ed. 2 vols., 1872; Eng. trans. by F. E. Bunnett, 1863, new ed. 1877). He also revised his History of German Literature, for a fourth edition (1853), and began at the same time to plan his Geschichte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts (8 vols., 1854‚Äì1860), which was preceded by an Einleitung in die Geschichte des neunzehnten Jahrhunderts (1853). The latter work caused some stir in the literary and political world, owing to the circumstance that the government of Baden imprudently instituted a prosecution against the author for high treason. Arraigned before a tribunal, Gervinus defended himself with a great display of ability and courage, but was nevertheless condemned to an imprisonment of two months, and all the copies of the \\"seditious publication\\" were to be destroyed. However, the verdict was rescinded by a higher tribunal. Afterward, Gervinus buried himself still more among his books, and even forebore to deliver lectures. In 1856, the H√§ndel-Gesellschaft society was founded by Gervinus and the German music historian and critic Friedrich Chrysander.Website of the George Frideric Handel Institute The aim of the society was to publish the collected works of Georg Frideric Handel. In 1868 appeared H√§ndel und Shakespeare, zur Asthetik der Tonkunst, in which he drew an ingenious parallel between his favorite poet and his favorite composer, showing that their intellectual affinity was based on the Teutonic origin common to both, on their analogous intellectual development and character. The ill-success of this publication, and the indifference with which the latter volumes of his History of the 19th Century were received by his countrymen, together with the feeling of disappointment that the unity of Germany had been brought about in another fashion and by other means than he wished to see employed, embittered his later years, though it did not sour his kindly and humane disposition, nor did it in the least affect his sociable temper, and he cultivated refined society to the last. He died in Heidelberg on 18 March 1871. Gervinus was a close friend of Georg Friedrich Fallenstein, the father of Helene Fallenstein, who would become the mother of the famous scholar, Max Weber. In her biography of Weber, Marianne Weber, his wife, writes that Helene was sexually molested and probably raped by Gervinus, who was living upstairs in the Fallenstein household after Fallenstein's death. The biography describes Gervinus as a \\"fatherly friend\\" of Fallenstein's daughters who regularly read Homer to the girls in their youth. \\"When she [Helene] was 16,\\" Marianne Weber writes, \\"a chaste, closed bud of a girl, Gervinus, whom she respected as a teacher, loved like a father, and had trusted for years, one day lost control of himself. The aging man suddenly engulfed the unsuspecting girl with the searing heat of a passion beyond control. She was torn by horror, disgust, pity, and her old grateful devotion to her fatherly friend and teacher. Because her nerves were delicate, she came close to a breakdown. Helene never got over this shock. From that moment on she regarded physical passion as guilt-laden and sub-human. Even when she was an old woman, the memory of that experience would bring an expression of horror to her face.\\" Soon thereafter, the biography continues, Helene met Max Weber Sr. Engagement soon followed, and Helene subsequently described their marriage (which over time would become an unhappy one) as having saved her from the trauma of the Gervinus assault.Max Weber: A Biography, translated from the German by Harry Zohn, John Wiley & Sons, New York, 1975 (originally published in German 1926), p. 20-21. Works Geschichte der Deutschen Dichtung was the first comprehensive history of German poetry in a connected form. The author represented the literary activity of Germany in its successive stages as it grew out of her political life, thus making political history the foil and basis of literary history. His judgment was sincere and independent, although his criticism often assumed a censorious and pedantic tone against the most prominent poets of Germany, for example Goethe, Schiller and Jean Paul. Notwithstanding this criticism, the German people, without allowing themselves to be misguided in their judgment regarding the merits of these poets, gratefully accepted his work as a national homage to the subject.This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: The object of Gervinus in writing this literary history was also a patriotic one. He endeavoured to show that Germany, having already attained great eminence in literature, should henceforth exclusively devote herself to political activity, and surpass other nations also in this respect. He had a no less patriotic object in view in writing his commentary on Shakespeare, which was made popular in England by a translation. This work is not so much a philological or aesthetical commentary as a treatise pointing out the ethical or moral precepts which may be deduced from Shakespeare's productions, and this circumstance makes it of considerable value and interest also to English readers. Gervinus, who considered Shakespeare the intellectual property of Germany, in the same way as he considered Handel the artistic property of England, wished above all to inculcate on his countrymen the teachings of healthy practical activity to be found in the works of the English dramatist. The object for which he wrote, that is the moral improvement of his readers from a practical point of view, seemed to him the easier to be accomplished through the productions of Shakespeare, because the poet was descended from a kindred race, and the fructifying seeds of his thoughts and sentiments, falling upon a congenial soil, would be sure to take root there kindly. As a political historian, Gervinus was the antipode of Ranke. Following the principles of F. C. Schlosser, he slighted all documentary history. He had such a deep distrust of all state papers and diplomatic documents that he considered them as most untrustworthy sources for any historical record. He confined himself, therefore, chiefly to taking into account the political events and their results just as they lay on the surface; and, not consulting the state archives for the secret springs which set them in motion, he based his historical narratives almost entirely on his subjective judgment. Many brilliant passages will be found in his general History of the 19th Century, such as the accounts of the South American and Greek revolutions, and of the July revolution in 1830; and his Historische Schriften also contain a number of valuable treatises and essays, which may be said to have paved the way to a new era in the art of writing history. Gervinus entertained a kindly feeling towards England, which he called the land of political mastery; and though he was rather a cosmopolitan, he nevertheless remained a German patriot to the core. Ranke's opinion was \\"that he will never be forgotten.\\" Bibliography Gervinus's autobiography (G. G. Gervinus Leben, von ihm selbst) was published by his widow in 1893. It does not, however, go beyond the year 1836. See E. Lehmann, Gervinus, Versuch einer Charakteristik (1871); R. Gosche, Gervinus (1871); J. D√∂rfel, Gervinus als historischer Denker (1904).

The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement. Overview The while construct consists of a block of code and a condition/expression. The condition/expression is evaluated, and if the condition/expression is true, the code within all of their following in the block is executed. This repeats until the condition/expression becomes false. Because the while loop checks the condition/expression before the block is executed, the control structure is often also known as a pre-test loop. Compare this with the do while loop, which tests the condition/expression after the loop has executed. For example, in the C programming language (as well as Java, C#, Objective-C, and C++, which use the same syntax in this case), the code fragment int x = 0; while (x < 5) { printf (\\"x = %d \\", x); x++; } first checks whether x is less than 5, which it is, so then the {loop body} is entered, where the printf function is run and x is incremented by 1. After completing all the statements in the loop body, the condition, (x < 5), is checked again, and the loop is executed again, this process repeating until the variable x has the value 5. Note that it is possible, and in some cases desirable, for the condition to always evaluate to true, creating an infinite loop. When such a loop is created intentionally, there is usually another control structure (such as a break statement) that controls termination of the loop. For example: while (true) { // do complicated stuff if (someCondition) break; // more stuff } Demonstrating while loops These while loops will calculate the factorial of the number 5: ActionScript 3 var counter: int = 5; var factorial: int = 1; while (counter > 1) { factorial *= counter; counter--; } Printf(\\"Factorial = %d\\", factorial); Ada with Ada.Integer_Text_IO; procedure Factorial is Counter : Integer := 5; Factorial : Integer := 1; begin while Counter > 0 loop Factorial := Factorial * Counter; Counter := Counter - 1; end loop; Ada.Integer_Text_IO.Put (Factorial); end Factorial; AutoHotkey counter := 5 factorial := 1 While counter > 0 factorial *= counter-- MsgBox % factorial Microsoft Small Basic counter = 5 ' Counter = 5 factorial = 1 ' initial value of variable \\"factorial\\" While counter > 0 factorial = factorial * counter counter = counter - 1 TextWindow.WriteLine(counter) EndWhile Visual Basic Dim counter As Integer = 5 ' init variable and set value Dim factorial As Integer = 1 ' initialize factorial variable Do While counter > 0 factorial = factorial * counter counter = counter - 1 Loop ' program goes here, until counter = 0 'Debug.Print factorial ' Console.WriteLine(factorial) in Visual Basic .NET Bourne (Unix) shell counter=5 factorial=1 while [ $counter -gt 0 ]; do factorial=$((factorial * counter)) counter=$((counter - 1)) done echo $factorial C or C++ int main() { int counter = 5; int factorial = 1; while (counter > 1) factorial *= counter--; printf(\\"%d\\", factorial); } =Script syntax= counter = 5; factorial = 1; while (counter > 1) { factorial *= counter--; } writeOutput(factorial); =Tag syntax= #factorial# Fortran program FactorialProg integer :: counter = 5 integer :: factorial = 1 do while (counter > 0) factorial = factorial * counter counter = counter - 1 end do print *, factorial end program FactorialProg Java, C#, D The code for the loop is the same for Java, C# and D: int counter = 5; int factorial = 1; while (counter > 1) factorial *= counter--; JavaScript let counter = 5; let factorial = 1; while (counter > 1) factorial *= counter--; console.log(factorial); Lua counter = 5 factorial = 1 while counter > 0 do factorial = factorial * counter counter = counter - 1 end print(factorial) MATLAB & GNU Octave counter = 5; factorial = 1; while (counter > 0) factorial = factorial * counter; %Multiply counter = counter - 1; %Decrement end factorial Mathematica Block[{counter=5,factorial=1}, (*localize counter and factorial*) While[counter>0, (*While loop*) factorial*=counter; (*Multiply*) counter--; (*Decrement*) ]; factorial ] Oberon, Oberon-2 (programming language), Oberon-07, or Component Pascal MODULE Factorial; IMPORT Out; VAR Counter, Factorial: INTEGER; BEGIN Counter := 5; Factorial := 1; WHILE Counter > 0 DO Factorial := Factorial * Counter; DEC(Counter) END; Out.Int(Factorial,0) END Factorial.

He worked as a correspondent for Time and Life magazines before selling his first script to Alcoa-Goodyear Theater. He got his break in Hollywood in 1958 as script editor for Have Gun ‚Äì Will Travel and moved on to write for the television series Naked City, Route 66 and others. He wrote or co-wrote several successful films, including Cat Ballou and Cool Hand Luke, which were both nominated for Academy Awards. He wrote Dog Day Afternoon, which won Pierson the Academy Award. He directed and contributed to the screenplay of the 1976 remake of A Star Is Born; and the in-fighting between himself, Barbra Streisand, Kris Kristofferson and producer (and at the time boyfriend of Streisand) Jon Peters on the film led him to write the article \\"My Battles with Barbra and Jon\\" for The Village Voice.Pierson, Frank (November 16, 1976). My Battles with Barbra and Jon. The Village Voice Pierson directed several films produced for television, including Dirty Pictures, Citizen Cohn, Conspiracy, and Somebody Has to Shoot the Picture. His direction on Conspiracy won a Directors' Guild Award for Best Television Movie, and his second Peabody and BAFTA Award. He was President of the Writers Guild of America, West (WGAW) from 1981 to 1983 and again from 1993 to 1995 and was President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) from 2001 to 2005. In 2003, Pierson was the recipient of the Austin Film Festival's Distinguished Screenwriter Award. Screenwriter Brian Helgeland presented him with the Award. He was a consultant on Mad Men, co- writing (with Matthew Weiner) the fifth episode of its fifth season, \\"Signal 30\\", a member of the teaching staff of Sundance Institute, and Artistic Director of the American Film Institute.

He built The Theatre, the first permanent dedicated theatre built in England since Roman times. Life James Burbage was born about 1531, probably in Bromley in Kent. He was apprenticed in London to the trade of joiner, and must have persevered through his apprenticeship and taken up his freedom, as in 1559 he was referred to as a joiner twice in the register of St Stephen's, Coleman Street. He was also one of the greatest at the craft of carpentry, which gave him an advantage at his start of theatrical management later in his life. Career Burbage took up acting and was the leader of Leicester's Men by 1572. Burbage had various talents, e.g. an actor, builder, and theatre owner; he was heavily involved in groups concerning theatre. He was said to be a theatre professional \\"who bridged the gap between late-medieval drama in london and the flowering of the great Elizabethan Theatre.\\"Pogue, Kate. p.48 Burbage was described as handsome in appearance, charming in manner, honest, tactful, and witty by Sir Robert Dudley, patron of Leicester's Men.Stopes, Charlotte C. Another professional acquaintance depicted James as more motivated by commerce than by art because of his dependency on financial success. He also was the father to one of Shakespeare personal friends, Richard Burbage, who played all the great roles in Shakespeare plays. Family Burbage married Ellen Brayne, the daughter of Thomas Brayne, a London tailor and sister of his later business partner John Brayne, on 23 April 1559. They were settled in St. Leonard's parish in Shoreditch by 1576, with residence in Halliwell Street or Holywell Lane.Chambers, Vol. 2, p. 306. Cuthbert Burbage, the elder son, followed in his father's footsteps as a theatre manager, while the younger son, Richard became one of the most celebrated actors of his era. He showed his talents alongside Shakespeare, both being co-owners of the Globe Theatre. Death James Burbage was buried in Shoreditch on 2 February 1597. He was buried a few hundred yards from St. Leonard's church, which is the burial ground for many other actors from this era. He died intestate (without a will). Having previously given his Blackfriars property to his son Richard and his personal property to his grandson Cuthbert, his widow presented an inventory valued at only ¬£37. He died right before the lease expired on the Theatre, so after his passing his son Richard, rebuild a theatre across the Thames river and 'called it the Globe Theatre. James Burbage and The Theatre Ground plan of The Theatre In 1576, Burbage and his partner John Brayne decided to create a new, permanent stage for London acting groups. It was one of the first permanent theatres to be built in London since the time of the Romans.Dutton, Richard. The Oxford Handbook of Early Modern Theatre. Brayne was Burbage's brother-in-law and was considered a wealthy man.Wallace, Charles William. The First London Theatre It was his investment (and the mortgage Burbage took out on the lease of the grounds) that allowed The Theatre to be built, with the two sharing the profits equally.Wallace, Charles William p. 5 Financial difficulties led Burbage and Brayne to stage plays in the building before construction was complete; the proceeds from these plays helping to finance the building's completion.Mateer, David. p. 335 Despite partnering with John Brayne, the lease of The Theatre's site was signed by Burbage alone on 13 April 1576, to begin on 25 March 1576.Dutton, Richard. p. 173 Since Burbage owned the lease, he also received rent money for properties on the site. Under this lease, he paid roughly ¬£14 a year. The exact builder of The Theatre is unknown, though a likely candidate is James Burbage's brother Robert, who was a carpenter. In 1594, a Privy Council order created the Lord Chamberlain's Men and gave it exclusive rights to play in the City of London at The Theatre.Gurr, need book and cite Performance at The Theatre Burbage was very confident that spectators would come to The Theatre, even if they had to go through open fields to get there. One contemporary of the time referred to people streaming out of the city to see the plays there. The Theatre was considered a grand classical name. It was made mostly of wood, with ironwork scattered throughout. There was a tiring house for the players, and galleries and luxury seats providing better viewing and privacy. These seats would typically cost an extra penny or two pence, as opposed to a penny for the average attendee.Sternlicht, Sanford. \\"Chapter 5: The Theater.\\" The Theatre was tested by the appearance of another playhouse, the Curtain Theatre, placed only 200 yards closer to the city walls. It was built by Henry Lanman (or Laneham), who had a close business relationship with Burbage and his associates. The two theatres pooled their profits together between the proprietors, using the Curtain Theatre to ease people into the more complex performances at The Theatre. As time went on, the shows in these playhouses became better organized, more popular, resourceful, and sophisticated in production. More playhouses such as The Rose and The Swan were built. The Blackfriars On 4 February 1596 Burbage purchased the Blackfriars Theatre property for ¬£600. The building had once been a Dominican monastery in the south-west corner of London, but Burbage had plans to renovate the building into the English- speaking world's first permanent, purpose-built indoor theatre. However, in November 1596, the residents of the district petitioned and managed to win a ban on play performances at the theatre. NotesReferences *Dutton, Richard.

Various keywords are used to specify this statement: descendants of ALGOL use \\"for\\", while descendants of Fortran use \\"do\\". There are other possibilities, for example COBOL which uses \\"PERFORM VARYING\\". A for-loop has two parts: a header specifying the iteration, and a body which is executed once per iteration. The header often declares an explicit loop counter or loop variable, which allows the body to know which iteration is being executed. For-loops are typically used when the number of iterations is known before entering the loop. For-loops can be thought of as shorthands for while-loops which increment and test a loop variable. The name for-loop comes from the English word for, which is used as the keyword in many programming languages to introduce a for-loop. The term in English dates to ALGOL 58 and was popularized in the influential later ALGOL 60; it is the direct translation of the earlier German f√ºr, used in Superplan (1949‚Äì1951) by Heinz Rutishauser, who also was involved in defining ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60. The loop body is executed \\"for\\" the given values of the loop variable, though this is more explicit in the ALGOL version of the statement, in which a list of possible values and/or increments can be specified. In FORTRAN and PL/I, the keyword DO is used for the same thing and it is called a do-loop; this is different from a do-while loop.  FOR  For loop illustration, from i=0 to i=2, resulting in data1=200 A for-loop statement is available in most imperative programming languages. Even ignoring minor differences in syntax there are many differences in how these statements work and the level of expressiveness they support. Generally, for-loops fall into one of the following categories:  Traditional for-loops  The for-loop of languages like ALGOL, Simula, BASIC, Pascal, Modula, Oberon, Ada, Matlab, Ocaml, F#, and so on, requires a control variable with start- and end-values and looks something like this: for i = first to last do statement (* or just *) for i = first..last do statement Depending on the language, an explicit assignment sign may be used in place of the equal sign (and some languages require the word even in the numerical case). An optional step-value (an increment or decrement ‚â† 1) may also be included, although the exact syntaxes used for this differs a bit more between the languages. Some languages require a separate declaration of the control variable, some do not. Another form was popularized by the C programming language. It requires 3 parts: the initialization, the condition, and the afterthought and all these three parts are optional. The initialization declares (and perhaps assigns to) any variables required. The type of a variable should be same if you are using multiple variables in initialization part. The condition checks a condition, and quits the loop if false. The afterthought is performed exactly once every time the loop ends and then repeats. Here is an example of the traditional for-loop in Java. // Prints the numbers from 0 to 99 (and not 100), each followed by a space. for (int i=0; i<100; i++) { System.out.print(i); System.out.print(' '); } System.out.println(); These loops are also sometimes called numeric for-loops when contrasted with foreach loops(see below).  Iterator-based for-loops  This type of for-loop is a generalisation of the numeric range type of for-loop, as it allows for the enumeration of sets of items other than number sequences. It is usually characterized by the use of an implicit or explicit iterator, in which the loop variable takes on each of the values in a sequence or other data collection. A representative example in Python is: for item in some_iterable_object: do_something() do_something_else() Where is either a data collection that supports implicit iteration (like a list of employee's names), or may in fact be an iterator itself. Some languages have this in addition to another for-loop syntax; notably, PHP has this type of loop under the name , as well as a three-expression for-loop (see below) under the name .  Vectorised for-loops  Some languages offer a for-loop that acts as if processing all iterations in parallel, such as the keyword in FORTRAN 95 which has the interpretation that all right-hand-side expressions are evaluated before any assignments are made, as distinct from the explicit iteration form. For example, in the statement in the following pseudocode fragment, when calculating the new value for , except for the first (with ) the reference to will obtain the new value that had been placed there in the previous step. In the version, however, each calculation refers only to the original, unaltered . for i := 2 : N - 1 do A(i) := [A(i - 1) + A(i) + A(i + 1)] / 3; next i; for all i := 2 : N - 1 do A(i) := [A(i - 1) + A(i) + A(i + 1)] / 3; The difference may be significant. Some languages (such as FORTRAN 95, PL/I) also offer array assignment statements, that enable many for-loops to be omitted. Thus pseudocode such as would set all elements of array A to zero, no matter its size or dimensionality. The example loop could be rendered as A(2 : N - 1) := [A(1 : N - 2) + A(2 : N - 1) + A(3 : N)] / 3; But whether that would be rendered in the style of the for-loop or the for all-loop or something else may not be clearly described in the compiler manual. Compound for-loops Introduced with ALGOL 68 and followed by PL/I, this allows the iteration of a loop to be compounded with a test, as in for i := 1 : N while A(i) > 0 do etc. That is, a value is assigned to the loop variable i and only if the while expression is true will the loop body be executed. If the result were false the for-loop's execution stops short. Granted that the loop variable's value is defined after the termination of the loop, then the above statement will find the first non-positive element in array A (and if no such, its value will be N + 1), or, with suitable variations, the first non-blank character in a string, and so on.  Loop counters  In computer programming a loop counter is the variable that controls the iterations of a loop (a computer programming language construct). It is so named because most uses of this construct result in the variable taking on a range of integer values in some orderly sequences (example., starting at 0 and end at 10 in increments of 1) Loop counters change with each iteration of a loop, providing a unique value for each individual iteration. The loop counter is used to decide when the loop should terminate and for the program flow to continue to the next instruction after the loop. A common identifier naming convention is for the loop counter to use the variable names i, j, and k (and so on if needed), where i would be the most outer loop, j the next inner loop, etc. The reverse order is also used by some programmers. This style is generally agreed to have originated from the early programming of FORTRAN, where these variable names beginning with these letters were implicitly declared as having an integer type, and so were obvious choices for loop counters that were only temporarily required. The practice dates back further to mathematical notation where indices for sums and multiplications are often i, j, etc. A variant convention is the use of reduplicated letters for the index, ii, jj, and kk, as this allows easier searching and search-replacing than using a single letter.http://www.knosof.co.uk/vulnerabilities/loopcntrl.pdf Analysis of loop control variables in C Example An example of C code involving nested for loops, where the loop counter variables are i and j: for (i = 0; i < 100; i++) { for (j = i; j < 10; j++) { some_function(i, j); } } It has been shown that a nested for loop, as in above example, performs more computations per unit time than a loop without it. This machine-independent optimisation means the nested for loop will finish faster, given the same number of computations to perform. This is an advantage nested for loop has over nested while loop, which behaves differently.Inner loop program construct: A faster way for program execution For loops in C can also be used to print the reverse of a word. As: for (i = 0; i < 6; i++) { scanf(\\"%c\\", &a;[i]); } for (i = 4; i >= 0; i--) { printf(\\"%c\\", a[i]); } Here, if the input is , the output will be . Additional semantics and constructs=Use as infinite loops This C-style for-loop is commonly the source of an infinite loop since the fundamental steps of iteration are completely in the control of the programmer. In fact, when infinite loops are intended, this type of for-loop can be used (with empty expressions), such as: for (;;) //loop body This style is used instead of infinite loops to avoid a type conversion warning in some C/C++ compilers. Some programmers prefer the more succinct form over the semantically equivalent but more verbose form. Early exit and continuation Some languages may also provide other supporting statements, which when present can alter how the for-loop iteration proceeds. Common among these are the break and continue statements found in C and its derivatives. The break statement causes the inner-most loop to be terminated immediately when executed. The continue statement will move at once to the next iteration without further progress through the loop body for the current iteration. A for statement also terminates when a break, goto, or return statement within the statement body is executed. [Wells] Other languages may have similar statements or otherwise provide means to alter the for-loop progress; for example in FORTRAN 95: DO I = 1, N statements !Executed for all values of \\"I\\", up to a disaster if any. IF (no good) CYCLE !Skip this value of \\"I\\", continue with the next. statements !Executed only where goodness prevails. IF (disaster) EXIT !Abandon the loop. statements !While good and, no disaster. END DO !Should align with the \\"DO\\". Some languages offer further facilities such as naming the various loop statements so that with multiple nested loops there is no doubt as to which loop is involved. Fortran 95, for example: X1:DO I = 1,N statements X2:DO J = 1,M statements IF (trouble) CYCLE X1 statements END DO X2 statements END DO X1 Thus, when \\"trouble\\" is detected in the inner loop, the CYCLE X1 (not X2) means that the skip will be to the next iteration for I, not J. The compiler will also be checking that each END DO has the appropriate label for its position: this is not just a documentation aid. The programmer must still code the problem correctly, but some possible blunders will be blocked. Loop variable scope and semantics Different languages specify different rules for what value the loop variable will hold on termination of its loop, and indeed some hold that it \\"becomes undefined\\". This permits a compiler to generate code that leaves any value in the loop variable, or perhaps even leaves it unchanged because the loop value was held in a register and never stored to memory. Actual behaviour may even vary according to the compiler's optimization settings, as with the Honywell Fortran66 compiler. In some languages (not C or C++) the loop variable is immutable within the scope of the loop body, with any attempt to modify its value being regarded as a semantic error. Such modifications are sometimes a consequence of a programmer error, which can be very difficult to identify once made. However, only overt changes are likely to be detected by the compiler. Situations where the address of the loop variable is passed as an argument to a subroutine make it very difficult to check, because the routine's behavior is in general unknowable to the compiler. Some examples in the style of Fortran: DO I = 1, N I = 7 !Overt adjustment of the loop variable. Compiler complaint likely. Z = ADJUST(I) !Function \\"ADJUST\\" might alter \\"I\\", to uncertain effect. normal statements !Memory might fade that \\"I\\" is the loop variable. PRINT (A(I), B(I), I = 1, N, 2) !Implicit for-loop to print odd elements of arrays A and B, reusing \\"I\\"... PRINT I !What value will be presented? END DO !How many times will the loop be executed? A common approach is to calculate the iteration count at the start of a loop (with careful attention to overflow as in in sixteen-bit integer arithmetic) and with each iteration decrement this count while also adjusting the value of : double counting results. However, adjustments to the value of within the loop will not change the number of iterations executed. Still another possibility is that the code generated may employ an auxiliary variable as the loop variable, possibly held in a machine register, whose value may or may not be copied to on each iteration. Again, modifications of would not affect the control of the loop, but now a disjunction is possible: within the loop, references to the value of might be to the (possibly altered) current value of or to the auxiliary variable (held safe from improper modification) and confusing results are guaranteed. For instance, within the loop a reference to element of an array would likely employ the auxiliary variable (especially if it were held in a machine register), but if is a parameter to some routine (for instance, a print-statement to reveal its value), it would likely be a reference to the proper variable instead. It is best to avoid such possibilities. =Adjustment of bounds= Just as the index variable might be modified within a for-loop, so also may its bounds and direction. But to uncertain effect. A compiler may prevent such attempts, they may have no effect, or they might even work properly - though many would declare that to do so would be wrong. Consider a statement such as for i := first : last : step do A(i) := A(i) / A(last); If the approach to compiling such a loop was to be the evaluation of , and and the calculation of an iteration count via something like once only at the start, then if those items were simple variables and their values were somehow adjusted during the iterations, this would have no effect on the iteration count even if the element selected for division by changed. List of value ranges PL/I and Algol 68, allows loops in which the loop variable is iterated over a list of ranges of values instead of a single range. The following PL/I example will execute the loop with six values of i: 1, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15: do i = 1, 7, 12 to 15; /*statements*/ end;  Equivalence with while-loops =In theory A for- loop can be converted into an equivalent while-loop by incrementing a counter variable directly. The following pseudocode illustrates this technique: factorial := 1 for counter from 1 to 5 factorial := factorial * counter is easily translated into the following while-loop: factorial := 1 counter := 1 while counter <= 5 factorial := factorial * counter counter := counter + 1 This translation is slightly complicated by languages which allow a statement to jump to the next iteration of the loop (such as the \\"continue\\" statement in C). These statements will typically implicitly increment the counter of a for- loop, but not the equivalent while-loop (since in the latter case the counter is not an integral part of the loop construct). Any translation will have to place all such statements within a block that increments the explicit counter before running the statement.  In practice  The formal equivalence applies only in so far as computer arithmetic also follows the axia of mathematics, in particular that x + 1 > x. Actual computer arithmetic suffers from the overflow of limited representations so that for example in sixteen- bit unsigned arithmetic, 65535 + 1 comes out as zero, because 65536 cannot be represented in unsigned sixteen-bit. Similar problems arise for other sizes, signed or unsigned, and for saturated arithmetic where 65535 + 1 would produce 65535. Compiler writers will handle the likes of , possibly by producing code that inspects the state of a hardware \\"overflow\\" indicator, but unless there is some provision for the equivalent checking after calculating the while-loop equivalence will fail because the counter will never exceed 65535 and so the loop will never end - unless some other mishap occurs.  Timeline of the for- loop syntax in various programming languages  Given an action that must be repeated, for instance, five times, different languages' for-loops will be written differently. The syntax for a three-expression for-loop is nearly identical in all languages that have it, after accounting for different styles of block termination and so on. 1957: FORTRAN Fortran's equivalent of the loop is the loop, using the keyword do instead of for, The syntax of Fortran's loop is: DO label counter = first, last, step statements label statement The following two examples behave equivalently to the three argument for-loop in other languages, initializing the counter variable to 1, incrementing by 1 each iteration of the loop and stopping at five (inclusive). DO 9, COUNTER = 1, 5, 1 WRITE (6,8) COUNTER 8 FORMAT( I2 ) 9 CONTINUE In Fortran 77 (or later), this may also be written as: do counter = 1, 5 write(*, '(i2)') counter end do The step part may be omitted if the step is one. Example: * DO loop example. PROGRAM MAIN SUM SQ = 0 DO 199 I = 1, 9999999 IF (SUM SQ.GT.1000) GO TO 200 199 SUM SQ = SUM SQ + I**2 200 PRINT 206, SUMSQ 206 FORMAT( I2 ) END Spaces are irrelevant in fixed-form Fortran statements, thus is the same as . In the modern free-form Fortran style, blanks are significant. In Fortran 90, the may be avoided by using an statement. * DO loop example. program main implicit none integer :: sumsq integer :: i sumsq = 0 do i = 1, 9999999 if (sumsq > 1000.0) exit sumsq = sumsq + i**2 end do print *, sumsq end program 1958: Algol Algol was first formalised in the Algol58 report. 1960: COBOL COBOL was formalized in late 1959 and has had many elaborations. It uses the PERFORM verb which has many options. Originally all loops had to be out-of-line with the iterated code occupying a separate paragraph. Ignoring the need for declaring and initialising variables, the COBOL equivalent of a for-loop would be. PERFORM SQ-ROUTINE VARYING I FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL I > 1000 SQ-ROUTINE ADD I**2 TO SUM-SQ. In the 1980s the addition of in-line loops and \\"structured\\" statements such as END-PERFORM resulted in a for-loop with a more familiar structure. PERFORM VARYING I FROM 1 BY 1 UNTIL I > 1000 ADD I**2 TO SUM-SQ. END-PERFORM If the PERFORM verb has the optional clause TEST AFTER, the resulting loop is slightly different: the loop body is executed at least once, before any test. 1964: BASIC Loops in BASIC are sometimes called for-next loops. 10 REM THIS FOR LOOP PRINTS ODD NUMBERS FROM 1 TO 15 20 FOR I = 1 TO 15 STEP 2 30 PRINT I 40 NEXT I Notice that the end-loop marker specifies the name of the index variable, which must correspond to the name of the index variable in the start of the for-loop. Some languages (PL/I, FORTRAN 95 and later) allow a statement label on the start of a for-loop that can be matched by the compiler against the same text on the corresponding end-loop statement. Fortran also allows the and statements to name this text; in a nest of loops this makes clear which loop is intended. However, in these languages the labels must be unique, so successive loops involving the same index variable cannot use the same text nor can a label be the same as the name of a variable, such as the index variable for the loop. 1964: PL/I do counter = 1 to 5 by 1; /* \\"by 1\\" is the default if not specified */ /*statements*/; end; The statement may be used to exit the loop. Loops can be labeled, and leave may leave a specific labeled loop in a group of nested loops. Some PL/I dialects include the statement to terminate the current loop iteration and begin the next. 1968: Algol 68 Algol68 has what was considered the universal loop, the full syntax is: FOR i FROM 1 BY 2 TO 3 WHILE i‚â†4 DO ~ OD Further, the single iteration range could be replaced by a list of such ranges. There are several unusual aspects of the construct * only the portion was compulsory, in which case the loop will iterate indefinitely. * thus the clause , will iterate exactly 100 times. * the syntactic element allowed a programmer to break from a loop early, as in: INT sum sq := 0; FOR i WHILE print((\\"So far:\\", i, new line)); # Interposed for tracing purposes. # sum sq ‚â† 70‚Üë2 # This is the test for the WHILE # DO sum sq +:= i‚Üë2 OD Subsequent extensions to the standard Algol68 allowed the syntactic element to be replaced with and to achieve a small optimization. The same compilers also incorporated: ;: for late loop termination. ;: for working on arrays in parallel. 1970: Pascal for Counter := 1 to 5 do (*statement*); Decrementing (counting backwards) is using keyword instead of , as in: for Counter := 5 downto 1 do (*statement*); The numeric-range for-loop varies somewhat more. 1972: C/C++ for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) statement The \`statement\` is often a block statement; an example of this would be: //Using for-loops to add numbers 1 - 5 int sum = 0; for (int i = 1; i < 6; ++i) { sum += i; } The ISO/IEC 9899:1999 publication (commonly known as C99) also allows initial declarations in loops. All the three sections in the for loop are optional. 1972: Smalltalk 1 to: 5 do: [ :counter  \\"statements\\" ] Contrary to other languages, in Smalltalk a for- loop is not a language construct but defined in the class Number as a method with two parameters, the end value and a closure, using self as start value. 1980: Ada for Counter in 1 .. 5 loop \\\\-- statements end loop; The exit statement may be used to exit the loop. Loops can be labeled, and exit may leave a specifically labeled loop in a group of nested loops: Counting: for Counter in 1 .. 5 loop Triangle: for Secondary_Index in 2 .. Counter loop \\\\-- statements exit Counting; \\\\-- statements end loop Triangle; end loop Counting; 1980: Maple Maple has two forms of for-loop, one for iterating of a range of values, and the other for iterating over the contents of a container. The value range form is as follows: for i from f by b to t while w do # loop body od; All parts except \`do\` and \`od\` are optional. The \`for i\` part, if present, must come first. The remaining parts (\`from f\`, \`by b\`, \`to t\`, \`while w\`) can appear in any order. Iterating over a container is done using this form of loop: for e in c while w do # loop body od; The \`in c\` clause specifies the container, which may be a list, set, sum, product, unevaluated function, array, or an object implementing an iterator. A for-loop may be terminated by \`od\`, \`end\`, or \`end do\`. 1982: Maxima CAS In Maxima CAS one can use also non integer values : for x:0.5 step 0.1 thru 0.9 do /* \\"Do something with x\\" */ 1982: PostScript The for-loop, written as initialises an internal variable, executes the body as long as the internal variable is not more than limit (or not less, if increment is negative) and, at the end of each iteration, increments the internal variable. Before each iteration, the value of the internal variable is pushed onto the stack. 1 1 6 {STATEMENTS} for There is also a simple repeat-loop. The repeat-loop, written as , repeats the body exactly X times. 5 { STATEMENTS } repeat 1983: Ada 83 and above procedure Main is Sum_Sq : Integer := 0; begin for I in 1 .. 9999999 loop if Sum_Sq <= 1000 then Sum_Sq := Sum_Sq + I**2 end if; end loop; end; 1984: MATLAB for n = 1:5 \\\\-- statements end After the loop, would be 5 in this example. As is used for the Imaginary unit, its use as a loop variable is discouraged. 1987: Perl for ($counter = 1; $counter <= 5; $counter++) { # implicitly or predefined variable # statements; } for (my $counter = 1; $counter <= 5; $counter++) { # variable private to the loop # statements; } for (1..5) { # variable implicitly called $_; 1..5 creates a list of these 5 elements # statements; } statement for 1..5; # almost same (only 1 statement) with natural language order for my $counter (1..5) { # variable private to the loop # statements; } (Note that \\"there's more than one way to do it\\" is a Perl programming motto.) 1988: Mathematica The construct corresponding to most other languages' for-loop is called Do in Mathematica Do[f[x], {x, 0, 1, 0.1}] Mathematica also has a For construct that mimics the for-loop of C-like languages For[x= 0 , x <= 1, x += 0.1, f[x] ] 1989: Bash # first form for i in 1 2 3 4 5 do # must have at least one command in loop echo $i # just print value of i done # second form for (( i = 1; i <= 5; i++ )) do # must have at least one command in loop echo $i # just print value of i done Note that an empty loop (i.e., one with no commands between and ) is a syntax error. If the above loops contained only comments, execution would result in the message \\"syntax error near unexpected token 'done'\\". 1990: Haskell The built-in imperative forM_ maps a monadic expression into a list, as forM_ [1..5] $ \\\\indx -> do statements or get each iteration result as a list in statements_result_list <\\\\- forM [1..5] $ \\\\indx -> do statements But, if you want to save the space of the [1..5] list, a more authentic monadic forLoop_ construction can be defined as import Control.Monad as M forLoopM_ :: Monad m => a -> (a -> Bool) -> (a -> a) -> (a -> m ()) -> m () forLoopM_ indx prop incr f = do f indx M.when (prop next) $ forLoopM_ next prop incr f where next = incr indx and used as: forLoopM_ (0::Int) (< len) (+1) $ \\\\indx -> do -- whatever with the index 1991: Oberon-2, Oberon-07, or Component Pascal FOR Counter := 1 TO 5 DO (* statement sequence *) END Note that in the original Oberon language the for- loop was omitted in favor of the more general Oberon loop construct. The for- loop was reintroduced in Oberon-2. 1991: Python Python does not contain the classical for loop, rather a \`foreach\` loop is used to iterate over the output of the builtin \`range()\` function which returns an iterable list of integers. for i in range(1, 6): # gives i values from 1 to 5 inclusive (but not 6) # statements print(i) # if we want 6 we must do the following for i in range(1, 6 + 1): # gives i values from 1 to 6 # statements print(i) Using \`range(6)\` would run the loop from 0 to 5. 1993: AppleScript repeat with i from 1 to 5 \\\\-- statements log i end repeat You can also iterate through a list of items, similar to what you can do with arrays in other languages: set x to {1, \\"waffles\\", \\"bacon\\", 5.1, false} repeat with i in x log i end repeat You may also use to exit a loop at any time. Unlike other languages, AppleScript does not currently have any command to continue to the next iteration of a loop. 1993: Lua for i = start, stop, interval do \\\\-- statements end So, this code for i = 1, 5, 2 do print(i) end will print: 1 3 5 For-loops can also loop through a table using ipairs() to iterate numerically through arrays and pairs() to iterate randomly through dictionaries. Generic for-loop making use of closures: for name, phone, address in contacts() do \\\\-- contacts() must be an iterator function end 1995: CFMLScript syntax= Simple index loop: for (i = 1; i <= 5; i++) { // statements } Using an array: for (i in [1,2,3,4,5]) { // statements } Using a list of string values: loop index=\\"i\\" list=\\"1;2,3;4,5\\" delimiters=\\",;\\" { // statements } The above example is only available in the dialect of CFML used by Lucee and Railo. =Tag syntax= Simple index loop: Using an array: Using a \\"list\\" of string values:  1995: Java  for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) { //perform functions within the loop; //can use the statement 'break;' to exit early; //can use the statement 'continue;' to skip the current iteration } For the extended for-loop, see Foreach loop 1995: JavaScript JavaScript supports C-style \\"three-expression\\" loops.

Oftentimes, the for-loops are directly translated to assembly-like compare instructions and conditional jump instructions. However, this is not always so. In some interpreted programming languages, for-loops are simply translated to while-loops. For instance, take the following Mint/Horchata code: for i = 0; i < 100; i++ print i end for each item of sequence print item end /* 'Translated traditional for-loop' */ i = 0 while i < 100 print i i++ end /* 'Translated for each loop' */ SYSTEM_VAR_0000 = 0 while SYSTEM_VAR_0000 < sequence.length() item = sequence[SYSTEM_VAR_0000] print item SYSTEM_VAR_0000++ end  See also  * Do while loop * Foreach * Loop counter * While loop  References  Category:Articles with example Ada code Category:Articles with example ALGOL 68 code Category:Articles with example C code Category:Articles with example Fortran code Category:Articles with example Perl code Category:Iteration in programming Category:Articles with example Python (programming language) code ","title":"For loop"},{"id":"468925","text":"Blaise de Vigen√®re (5 April 1523 - 19 February 1596) () was a French diplomat, cryptographer, translator and alchemist.  Biography  Vigen√®re was born into a respectable family in the village of Saint-Pour√ßain. His father, Jean, arranged for him to have a classical education in Paris. Blaise de Vigen√®re studied Greek, Hebrew and Italian under Adrianus Turnebus and Jean Dorat. At age 17 he entered the diplomatic service and remained there for 30 years, retiring in 1570. Five years into his career he accompanied the French envoy Louis Adh√©mar de Grignan to the Diet of Worms as a junior secretary. At age 24, he entered the service of the Duke of Nevers as his secretary, a position he held until the deaths of the Duke and his son in 1562. He also served as a secretary to Henry III. In 1549 he visited Rome on a two-year diplomatic mission, and again in 1566. On both trips, he read books about cryptography and came in contact with cryptologists. When Vigen√®re retired aged 47, he donated his 1,000 livres a year income to the poor in Paris. He married a Marie Var√©. He died of throat cancer in 1596 and is buried in the Saint- √âtienne-du-Mont church.  Vigen√®re cipher  The method of encryption known as the \\"Vigen√®re cipher\\" was misattributed to Blaise de Vigen√®re in the 19th century and was in fact first described by Giovan Battista Bellaso in his 1553 book La cifra del. Sig. Giovan Battista Bellaso.(published in Vigen√®re created a different, stronger autokey cipher in (1586). It differs from Bellaso's in several ways: * Bellaso used a \\"reciprocal table\\" of five alphabets; Vigen√®re used ten; * Bellaso's cipher was based on the first letter of the word; Vigen√®re used a letter agreed upon before communication.  Works  After his retirement, Vigen√®re composed and translated over 20 books, including: * Les Chroniques et annales de Poloigne. Paris: Jean Richer, 1573.

Etymology and history  Stillwell Avenue at Bay Parkway and Bay Ridge Parkway Bensonhurst derives its name from Egbert Benson (1789‚Äì1866), whose lands were sold by his children and grandchildren to James D. Lynch, a New York real estate developer. Lynch bought the old farmlands from the Benson family in the mid-1880s, and by 1888, began selling private lots in an area dubbed as Bensonhurst-by-the-Sea, now Bath Beach. The first sale of lands in \\"The New Seaside Resort\\" area was advertised in the July 24, 1888 issue of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. Through the mid-20th century, Bensonhurst developed as an Italian and Jewish enclave. Despite a wave of commercial development in the 1980s, some land had remained undeveloped by then. By the early 2000s, condominiums were being built in Bensonhurst, and it had turned into a diverse community of Chinese, Italian, Mexican, Middle-Eastern, and Russian residents. Demographics Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the combined population of Bensonhurst West and Bensonhurst East was 151,705, an increase of 8,499 (5.9%) from the 143,206 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012.

Hispanics or Latinos of any race were 13.4% (20,283) of the population.Table PL-P3A NTA: Total Population by Mutually Exclusive Race and Hispanic Origin - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, March 29, 2011. Accessed June 14, 2016. The entirety of Community Board 11 had 204,829 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 83.8 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 20% are between the ages of 0‚Äì17, 31% between 25‚Äì44, and 26% between 45‚Äì64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 8% and 15% respectively. As of 2016, the median household income in Community District 12 was $53,493. In 2018, an estimated 23% of Bensonhurst residents lived in poverty, compared to 21% in all of Brooklyn and 20% in all of New York City. Less than one in ten residents (8%) were unemployed, compared to 9% in the rest of both Brooklyn and New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 52% in Bensonhurst, about the same as the citywide and boroughwide rates of 52% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Bensonhurst is considered to be low-income and not gentrifying relative to the rest of the city. Ethnic enclaves 18th Ave and 66th St In the early 20th century, many Italians and Jewish migrants moved into the neighborhood, and prior to World War II, the neighborhood was about equally Jewish and Italian. In the 1940s, under pressure of an influx of immigrants from southern Italy moving in, leaving the area predominantly Italian. Traditionally, most of the Italians in the area lived in the small apartment buildings centered around the Bay Parkway corridor, with the Jews mostly in the private homes. Around 1989, an influx of immigrants from China and the former USSR began to arrive, mainly from Southern China, Russia, Ukraine, and Armenia. In the 2000s, Bensonhurst rapidly grew in cultural diversity. Bensonhurst is home to many ethnic Polish, Ukrainian, Russian, Albanian, Bosnian, Greek, Turkish, Georgian, Uzbek, Arab, Palestinian, Egyptian, Lebanese, Pakistani, Mexican, Guatemalan, Salvadorian, Ecuadorian, and Puerto Rican Americans. In 2000, the New York City Department of City Planning determined that just over half of the residents were born in another country. By 2013, then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that the city's foreign-born population had reached a record high, and that Bensonhurst had the city's second-highest number of foreign-born people with 77,700 foreign born immigrants in the neighborhood, just after Washington Heights. Little Italy 18th Avenue and Bay Ridge Parkway With a large Italian-American population, Bensonhurst is usually considered the main \\"Little Italy\\" of Brooklyn. The Italian-speaking community was over 20,000 strong, according to the census of 2000. The Italian-speaking community, though, is becoming \\"increasingly elderly and isolated, with the small, tight-knit enclave in the city slowly disappearing as they give way to demographic changes.\\" Its main thoroughfare, 18th Avenue (also known as Cristoforo Colombo Boulevard) between roughly 60th Street and Shore Parkway, is lined with predominantly small, Italian family-owned businesses‚Äîmany of which have remained in the same family for several generations. 86th Street is another popular local thoroughfare, located under the elevated BMT West End Line. In addition, despite changing demographics over the recent years, Bensonhurst is still home to one of the largest Italian speaking communities outside of Italy and is still home to the largest Sicilian and Neapolitan speaking communities outside of Sicily and Naples, respectively. The annual Festa di Santa Rosalia (commonly known as \\"the Feast\\" to locals), is held on 18th Avenue from Bay Ridge Parkway (75th Street) to 66th Street in late August or early September. \\"The Feast\\" is presented by Bensonhurst resident and marketer Franco Corrado, as well as by the Santa Rosalia Society, on 18th Avenue. Born in Rome in 1955, Corrado has been an active social member of the Italian-American community for the past 20 years. St. Rosalia is the patron saint of the city of Palermo and is sometimes venerated as the patron for the entire island of Sicily. The annual end-of- summer celebration attracts thousands. Bensonhurt also hosts a Columbus Day parade. Like Lower Manhattan's Little Italy, Bensonhurst's Little Italy and its Italian-American population is declining, with the rapid expansion of its Chinatown and Chinese population. Little Hong Kong/Little Guangdong The of the New York City Subway system connects Brooklyn's Bensonhurst Chinatown (Âîê‰∫∫Ë°ó, Êú¨Ê£ÆÁ§æÂå∫) to Manhattan's Chinatown (Á¥êÁ¥ÑËèØÂü†). Below the West End Line, served by the along 86th Street between 18th Avenue and the intersection with Stillwell Avenue, is a small emerging Brooklyn Chinatown (Â∏ÉÈ≤ÅÂÖãÊûóËèØÂü†). It remains intermixed with Italian, Jewish, and Russian residents, but in the 2010s, most of the new businesses between 18th Avenue and 25th Avenue, have been Chinese. 86th Street is home to a growing number of Chinese restaurants, including the 86 Wong Chinese Restaurant (one of the earliest Chinese businesses established in Bensonhurst), as well as Chinese grocery stores, salons, bakeries, and other types of businesses. The subway directly connects to Manhattan's Chinatown (Á¥êÁ¥ÑËèØÂü†), and indirectly to the Chinatown in Sunset Park, which is served by the at the 8th Avenue station. With the large migration of the Cantonese and some Fuzhouese people in Brooklyn now to Bensonhurst, as well as new Chinese immigration, other clusters of Chinese businesses and residences have also started to emerge in other parts of Bensonhurst such as 18th Avenue and Bay Parkway, creating other newer small emerging Chinatowns in Bensonhurst in addition to the one on 86th Street under the D train. These are connected to the Sunset Park Chinatown by the .BEYOND CHINATOWN: DUAL IMMIGRATION AND THE CHINESE POPULATION OF METROPOLITAN NEW YORK CITY, 2000 , SUNY-New Paltz study, 2002. The newly emerging Chinese enclaves in sections of Bensonhurst, and another one in Homecrest/Sheepshead Bay, are primarily Cantonese populated and are more of extensions of the Western Cantonese section of Manhattan's Chinatown or Little Hong Kong(Â∞èÈ¶ôÊ∏Ø)/Little Guangdong(Â∞èÂª£Êù±) or Cantonese Town (Á≤µË™ûÂü†). However, there are also small numbers are Fuzhou- and Mandarin- speakers. The Flushing-based New World Shopping Center, which owns and operates a Chinese supermarket called Jmart Supermarket inside their shopping center, opened a second branch of Jmart Supermarket in Bensonhurst in 2018. It is the neighborhood's largest Chinese Asian style supermarket. The Jmart is located in a former Waldbaum's. According to a 2015 article in The New York Times, Bensonhurst's Chinese population is 31,658, and this population is primarily Cantonese-speaking from Mainland China's Guangdong Province and Hong Kong. In addition, the majority of Brooklyn's Cantonese population is concentrated in Bensonhurst, and is slowly replacing Manhattan's Chinatown as the largest primary Cantonese cultural center in New York City resulting in Bensonhurst increasingly becoming the main largest attraction for newly arriving Cantonese immigrants into New York City with Homecrest/Sheepshead Bay as a smaller secondary attraction. In 2011, the New York Daily News reported that Manhattan's Chinatown Chinese population dropped from 34,554 to 28,681 from 2000 to 2010, and that it is continuing to decline due to the gentrification going on in Lower Manhattan, which has spurred the increasing growth of newer Chinatowns in Brooklyn including in Queens. As of the 2010s, the current Chinese population in Bensonhurst has grown so much that it is enough to create another large Chinatown surpassing Manhattan's Chinatown and nearly being as big as Sunset Park's Chinatown.https://www.nytimes.com/projects/census/2010/map.htmlhttps://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data- maps/nyc-population/nny2013/chapter3.pdf However, unlike in Sunset Park where the Chinese community is highly concentrated, the Chinese community in Bensonhurst is split into several sections, such as 18th Avenue, Bay Parkway, and 86th Street. The Daily News also stated that Brooklyn's Asian population, mainly Chinese, has grown tremendously, not only in the Sunset Park area, but also in Bensonhurst, Dyker Heights, and Borough Park. In Bensonhurst alone, from 2000 to 2010, the Asian population increased by 57%. The study also showed that Asians very often live in houses that are divided into studio apartments, which means the Asian population could be higher than indicated on censuses. Chinese translation terms Bensonhurst as Êú¨Ê£ÆÁ§æÂå∫. =New York City's largest Hong Kong community= Further, Bensonhurst and the nearby neighborhood of Bath Beach collectively have the largest concentration of Hong Kong immigrants in New York City. The 2010 census information shows that Bensonhurst has 3,723 Hong Kong residents, while Bath Beach has 1,049 Hong Kong residents.  Land use and terrain  Many of Bensonhurst's houses are attached or semidetached, though fully detached houses can be found in the west near Dyker Heights. These are mostly 20th-century houses made of brick, stucco, and stone, with aluminum siding facades. There are also clusters of apartment buildings throughout the neighborhood. After rezoning in the 2000s, many short single-family homes were torn down and replaced by three-story brick apartment buildings and multi-family condominiums.

After the revolt, he was President of the Military Command Council that governed the country. During his rule, he cemented the central government's control over the country, planned on ending tribal loyalty, and Yemen's medieval social classes by proclaiming all Yemenis as equal. He also improved relations with Saudi Arabia.  Early life and career Ibrahim was born in Qattab, Ibb. His oldest brother said that Ibrahim was one day in his early childhood playing near the pond filled with water with his father Mohammed Al- Hamdi. When he approached closer to the edge and began to touch the water, he saw his image on the surface of the water net pool. Then he mistakenly tried to save his reflection, believing it to be a drowning man because of his childhood innocence, causing him to slide in the pool; luckily some of his family members were there to save him after his stomach filled with water. In his adulthood - specifically in its infancy- he was an associate for his father, who worked as a judge. His father taught him everything about Islamic law while he was studying in the Aviation College to become a pilot, but did not complete his studies and continued working with his father as a judge in the court of Dhamar in the reign of Imam Ahmed Yahya Hamid al-Din where he raised much controversy and attention. Then, he became in the era of President Abdullah as-Sallal the commander of the commandos, then the responsibility for the western, eastern, and central provinces in 1972 then he was promoted to become the Deputy Prime Minister for Internal Affairs, then he was appointed to the position of the higher representative Commander of the Armed Forces, then on 13 June 1974 he was an effective member of the officers who ran the white military coup overthrowing the Judge Abdul Rahman al-Iryani in the revolutionary correction movement of 13 June 1974 and handed over all the president's and the members' of the republican council authorities to the military forces which represented in the leadership of the general and senior officers mentioned: Ahmad Ghashmi, Yahya Mutawakil, Mujahid Abu Shawareb, Ali Al-Shibh, Hammoud Pedder, Ali Alilla'a, AED Abu Meat, Ali Abu Lohoum, and added later Abdaziz Abdul Ghani and Abdullah Abdulalim. The Revolutionary Correction Movement Al-Hamdi and some revolutionary officers during his presidency (1974-1977) Colonel Ibrahim al-Hamdi led the thirteenth corrective movement. Hamdi aimed to correct the Yemeni revolutionary path, to get rid of a \\"legacy of decadence.\\" He primarily sought to calm tribal feuds and regional conflicts, which had been prevalent under previous rulers. Thus, security was his top concern. He also promoted financial reforms to put an end to favoritism and bribery. He created committees to implement these reforms, saving estimated tens of millions of Riyals. Furthermore, he initiated a large infrastructure plan, paving thousands of kilometres of dirt roads, building thousands of schools, and hundreds of clinics and health centres. He encouraged people and many non-local investors to invest in the sections of agriculture and local manufacturing. This period saw rising standards of living and much prosperity. Also, the government has implemented the triple UNDP, produced a strong ground for the northern part of the country to start in the developments and implementations of the quinary plans, that routed Yemen to keep up with the twentieth-century development. Due to the efforts of the leadership of the thirteenth of June movement, which have carried out the first phase of the first quinary plan with great success .and Yemen achieved through it tremendous strides on the path to build the new Yemen, where the average of growth exceeded (6.5%) of it was planned. In addition, the Yemeni's life shifted from suffering life to prosperity life. The physical appearance showed signs of grace and comfort. Yemeni expatriate has raised his head high in that era in the citizen migratory, after having been stooping his head for a long period of time. In national affairs, al-Hamdi brought good relations between the two parts of the country, a few steps from unity, until the intervention of foreign powers interrelated with a strong dark interior to assassinate the uncompleted Yemeni dream. Accomplishments during his tenure On the first day of his presidency and after a quick review in important topics and crowded agenda, he issued emergency order to stop media campaigns against the South and its leadership with assertion that the unity will remain the only option for the Yemeni people no matter how varied opinions and attitudes, because it is a great goal needs a mighty sacrifice. Immediately President Salim Rubai Ali famous as \\"Salmeen\\" reciprocated the same desire and the same sense, setting a strong relationship between two of them which has taken a personal nature more than the official. It seemed this man has started his presidency path with arduous efforts and assisted by a group of young faces qualified academically to build a modern government based on law, order, and institutions. It was a difficult task but not impossible for a commander collected in his persona the power and the model, plus his culture and excellence through his civilian and military experiences, and what was more important is the honor that observed from his family when he worked as a judge (during his short experience in the judiciary while the absence of his father Judge Mohammed Saleh al-Hamdi all provisions was ending to between the rivals) so he learned two rules that justice is the base of governance, and the base of governance is the fear of the God. thus he has proved his worth as a national leader through several Workers in addition to justice, including: * Lay a long-term economic plan to grow the country. * Pay all the government debt and started to loan the World Bank. * Help in reducing the power of tribes and Saudi backed sheiks and strengthening the rule of law. * Put down all military ranks, which amounted to inflation and their holders to satiety providers including his rank to attributed the soldier's and officers lost prestige. * Prevented the use of government vehicles and military or public institutions cars for personal purposes. * Increased the salary along with four additional salaries in some occasions like Eid al-Fitr and Eid al- Adha, the anniversary of the revolution and the anniversary of the thirteen of June Movement. Under al-Hamdi's administration, Yemen enjoyed the most prosperous economic boom since 1962, as he was responsible for a civil engineering endeavour that would usher in an era of unprecedented economic growth in Yemen's post-Imamate history. More specifically, Hamdi fostered the creation of 'Local Development Associations,' which functioned as autonomous community-based institutions focused on developing local infrastructure. Scholar Isa Blumi notes that while \\"Able to exclusively access the potential tax revenue under their jurisdictions, the committees created from members of the community could also solicit external funds and loans (almost exclusively drawn from local, non-banking sources) independently of the central state and bank now formally connected to the outside world.\\"Blumi, Isa. Yemen: What Chaos in Arabia Tells Us About the World, p. 127. In other words, during the 1970s the LDAs did the heavy lifting as far as the development of Yemen's infrastructure was concerned. What is more, the locally driven LDAs protected the Yemeni countryside from an influx of foreign finance capital (disguised as development 'aid' and often tethered to massive usury rates). The LDA system thus preserved Yemen's economic sovereignty until 1978.Blumi, Isa. Yemen: What Chaos in Arabia Tells Us About the World, p.128 Assassination Al-Hamdi's murder was not officially investigated. However, it is famously known that he was assassinated at the house of Ahmad al-Ghashmi with the support of Saudi Arabia. His assassination came two days before his scheduled visit to the South of Yemen to negotiate the unification of the North and South of Yemen at that time. His death cleared the ground for Ali Abdullah Saleh, who sought the immediate reversal of Hamdi's local development agenda.Blumi, Isa. Yemen: What Chaos in Arabia Tells Us About the World, p. 134. These schemes, which depended heavily on loans from the IMF and World Bank and required the mass liberalization of publicly owned assets, \\"aimed to install an ethos that equated 'rural development' with the importation of certain technologies and expertise only US corporations could provide.\\"Tutwiler, 1990.

The Church of Rome declared the Novatianists heretical following the letters of Saint Cyprian of Carthage. Novatian After the martyrdom of Pope Fabian during the Decian persecution, a Roman priest, Novatian, opposed the election of Pope Cornelius in 251, on the grounds that Cornelius was too liberal in accepting lapsed Christians. Novatian held that lapsed Christians, who had not maintained their confession of faith under persecution, may not be received again into communion with the church. He was consecrated bishop by three bishops of Italy and declared himself to be the true Pope. He and his followers were excommunicated by a synod held at Rome in October of the same year.Chapman, John. \\"Novatian and Novatianism.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 24 February 2016 Novatian is said to have suffered martyrdom under the Emperor Valerian I (253‚Äì60). Novatian should not be confused with one Novatus, a priest of Carthage, who advocated re-admitting the \\"lapsi\\" without an enforced penance.Chapman, John. \\"St. Cyprian of Carthage.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 24 February 2016 Cyprian of Carthage came to a position opposed to both and advocated a council be held to establish a policy under which former idolaters could be once again admitted to communion with the church. Lardner argues that Eusebius and the Greeks in general were correct in calling the Roman presbyter Novatus, not Novatianus. He attributes the origin of the latter name to Cyprian, who called the Roman presbyter Novatianus, as being a follower of his own rebellious priest, Novatus of Carthage.Stokes, G. T., \\"Novatianus and Novatianism\\", A Dictionary of Early Christian Biography, (Henry Wace, ed.), John Murray, London, 1911 Novatianism after Novatian Novatian's strict views existed before him and may be found in The Shepherd of Hermas. After his death, the Novatianist sect spread rapidly and could be found in every province, and were very numerous in some places. Those who allied themselves with the doctrines of Novatian were called Novatianists. However, they called themselves Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±œÅŒøŒπ (\\"katharoi\\") or \\"Purists\\" (not to be confused with the later Cathars) reflecting their desire not to be identified with what they considered the lax practices of a corrupted and what was hitherto a universal Church. While Novatian had refused absolution to the \\"lapsi\\" (those who had renounced their Christianity under persecution but later wanted to return to the church), his followers extended this doctrine to include all \\"mortal sins\\" (idolatry, murder, and adultery, or fornication). Most of them forbade second marriage. They always had a successor of Novatian at Rome, and everywhere they were governed by bishops. Because Novatianists (including Novatian) did not submit to the bishop of Rome, they were labeled by Rome as schismatics. Additionally, Rome also labeled Novatianists heretics for denying that the Church had the power to grant absolution in certain cases (such as to the lapsi). Beyond that, their practices and beliefs were the same as that of the rest of the Catholic Church, including monasticism in the fourth century. In the 4th and 5th centuries, the Donatist sect in Africa Proconsulare maintained a similar belief about Christians who had lapsed under the pressures of persecution. They too were declared heretics.

Breyer, acted as proxy sponsor for the admiral's wife. The ship was commissioned on 7 March 1964, CDR Walter G. Lessman in command. Decommissioned on 27 April 1990, the ship sold to Greece and used for spare parts in 1992 and sunk as a target on 19 June 2003. Service Following a 45-day fitting out period at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington, Richard E. Byrd steamed for her homeport of Norfolk, Virginia, via the Panama Canal, arriving 14 June 1964. Richard E. Byrd deployed to the Mediterranean 6 January 1965 as a unit of Destroyer Division 182. Late January 1967 Richard E. Byrd moved south to the Jacksonville, Florida operations area, and, while serving as rescue destroyer for the aircraft carrier , she rescued Lt. (jg) John F. Dickinson, whose A4-E aircraft crashed during a landing approach. In May Richard E. Byrd was at sea as part of the screen of the carrier , which force rendezvoused with the damaged on 9 June. On 6 October 1969 ship and crew participated together with Senator Harry F. Byrd and Virginia Gov. Mills E.

On 26 January 1975, an advance party landing party of two ship officers were mobbed by an angry demonstration of 4,000 Greeks on the island of Corfu. After being stoned, attempts were made to set their car on fire and lynch the occupants. One Greek was killed in the incident, but police and fire trucks successfully escorted the two back to their ship off shore. Over the next hours the protest demonstration regarding the Cypriot War swelled to 10,000, and Richard E. Byrd ended her port visit. Early 1985, the start of a six-month North Atlantic cruise involved a port visit to Lisbon, Portugal. At the end of the visit on 28 January about 3 a.m. local GMT, five other NATO ships and Richard E.

It was a universal ticket which allowed users to ride on the city's Metlink and Metropolitan Transit Authority (Victoria) network, consisting of suburban trains, trams, and buses, including the NightRider network. The Metcard was a credit card-sized ticket made out of cardboard and used a magnetic strip to store fare data. Metcard was operated by OneLink Transit Systems under a contract with the Government of Victoria which was managed by the Transport Ticketing Authority. History Several Metcards Back of a validated Metcard In July 1983, the Metropolitan Transit Authority was formed to integrate Melbourne's tram, train and bus services. The Metropolitan Transit Authority also integrated bus, train and tram ticketing using punch card and scratch card tickets. Under the arrangements, the Government of Victoria collected all revenue from the sale of multi-modal tickets, which was then allocated to the various operators on the basis of an agreed formula. Moves towards automated ticketing were first made in 1992. Tenders were called for the design, supply, installation and on- going maintenance of the system, with the 'OneLink Transit Consortium' becoming the preferred tenderer in September 1993. The contract was signed in May 1994, with the major technology supplier being the ERG Group (now Vix Technology). Testing of prototypes commenced in December 1993, and the roll- out of the system was carried out from August 1996 to April 1998. Public field trials were carried out on buses from 20 August 1996, and on rail services from 18 September 1996. Acceptance occurred in November 1997. The system commenced full revenue service from May 1998 at a cost of $330 million. Contractual issues between OneLink and the Victorian Government were not settled until May 2002 with the payment of up to $65 million in a staged settlement. In 2002, Metcard replaced the functionally identical yet technically simpler punch tickets and scratchie tickets, which were easy to cheat. In 2009, the rollout of a new smartcard ticketing system, Myki, would start the end of Metcard. In 2011, it was announced that the Metcard system would be turned off by 29 December 2012. Controversy Controversy surrounded Metcard at its introduction, due to cost over-runs, the abolition of tram conductors and the unreliability of ticket purchasing and validation machines. The ticket vending machines were frequently attacked by vandals (often by pouring liquids into the coin slot), and have undergone several revisions to their design since. An audit released by the Victorian Government in 2001 showed over 1 in 4 (27.2%) of machines at railway stations did not work, and 11.9% of mobile equipment in buses and trams were non-operational. The State Government renegotiated with ticketing network contract operator OneLink Transit Systems to improve the service to commuters. Following these improvements, a 2002 audit showed an increase in availability of machines to 92.1% at railway stations, and 98.3% on buses and trams. Usability was also improved, with tram machines able to sell daily tickets. Furthermore, vandalism across the network dropped by 62% between 2001 and 2002. V/Line tickets were aligned with the Metcard system in April 2006, with each V/Line ticket to stations in the Metcard area having the relevant zones printed on them. In March 2007 the Nightrider bus service was also brought under the Metcard system. and zone 3 of the system was abolished, being merged with zone 2. The original Metcard contract with OneLink was to last nine years, expiring in March 2007. In 2005 the contract was amended to permit the system to be extended and modified as work on the replacement myki project progressed, with the contract being able to be terminated on six months notice. Operation A 'small' MVM 1 Metcard vending machine Southern Cross station All forms of public transport could be accessed by using a single Metcard. Metcards were a time and zone based ticket, with validity periods ranging from 2 hours to yearly, and two zones covering the Melbourne metropolitan area. When the system was in full operation, Metcards could be purchased from: * rail stations Ticket Vending Machines * ticket vending machines on board trams (coin only) and the Stony Point train * bus drivers * Premium (staffed) stations * the Met Shop (inside the Melbourne Town Hall on Swanston Street) * authorised Metcard outlets such as newsagencies and milk bars * the internet * by phone Ticket availability varied, with the sources above each stocking slightly different ranges beyond the standard two-hour, daily and seniors tickets. Availability on board buses was particularly restricted, with neither the Sunday Saver nor off-peak tickets being available from drivers. Similarly ticket vending machines at railway stations did not stock Sunday Savers or some types of off-peak tickets. Payment options varied from coin-only (small Metcard machines on trams and at railway stations), EFTPOS, coin and some notes (large ticket machines at stations) to EFTPOS, credit card, coin and all notes (premium railway stations). In March 2008 the new route 401 bus service from North Melbourne railway station to the Royal Melbourne Hospital and University of Melbourne became the first and only bus route in Melbourne that required the purchase of a Metcard before travel. Metcards were 'validated' when entering or exiting railway stations, and getting on trams or buses. The first validation printed an expiry date and time on the back of the ticket. Subsequent validations of most types of tickets did not print extra times but the data was intended to be used to count passenger numbers (in order to improve transport services). Revalidation of already validated tickets, whilst functionally unnecessary, was and is still required by law and occasional campaigns continue to remind passengers of this. When transport operations were franchised, revalidation data was also used to apportion revenue share between operators. This has since been abandoned in favour of fixed percentage allocations (40% train, 40% tram and 20% bus). With most railway stations not having ticket-operated barriers and trams not having conductors, enforcement was and is still the responsibility of roaming Authorised Officers (ticket inspectors). Authorised Officers (AOs) check that passengers have the correct ticket and, if using a concession ticket, have a suitable concession card. AOs did not issue fines directly but issued an infringement notice. The passenger then received a letter from the Department of Transport, who may issue a fine. Passengers could either pay the fine, or contest it by letter or in court. Zones and fares Metcard tickets function within a zonal system. Melbourne is divided into two zones: Zone 1 (Yellow) and Zone 2 (Blue). Until early 2007, there was also a Zone 3 (Red), but this was abolished by extending Zone 2 to all areas covered by Zone 3. The two zones form concentric rings, with Zone 1 comprising the inner suburbs, and Zone 2 covering the remainder of metropolitan Melbourne. Zone 3 covered the outer eastern, southern and south- eastern metropolitan area, but this area is now part of Zone 2. Zone overlap areas exist on the borders of the zones. In these areas tickets for either zone are acceptable. The fare payable depends on the zone or zones in which the passenger travels, with higher fares for trips that include both travel zones A separate fare and ticketing system exists for V/Line (country) services. However, since April 2006 holders of V/Line tickets to Melbourne have had access to both Zone 1 and 2 without needing to purchase another ticket. V/Line tickets to Zone 2 stations are valid for Zone 2 only. Fares in most towns just outside Melbourne were also aligned to Zone 2 Metcard prices as part of this integration. A range of tickets was available, including two- hour, all-day, weekly, monthly and annual tickets. There were also concession tickets for students, seniors and others. As of 2010, a daily Zone 1 and 2 full-fare (as distinct from concession fare) ticket costs A$2.70, and a weekly Zone 1 and 2 ticket costs A$10.40. Prices generally rise by inflation (CPI) on 1 January each year, though there have been occasional higher than CPI increases. Transition to Myki Flinders Street station that has been modified to accept Myki. Myki and Metcard were allowed to coexist with each other, but Metcard was eventually phased out in favour of Myki. The Metcard system was originally scheduled to be replaced in 2008 by a contactless smart card ticketing system, called myki, which will also cover all public transport in the state. However, in February 2008 Victorian Public Transport Minister Lynne Kosky announced that the full roll out of the system would not begin until the end of 2008.The Age: Smartcard Runs Two Years Late ‚Äì 5 February 2008 Approximately 7 weeks later, the system was delayed for approximately another 2 years, with an announcement that the service was now scheduled to begin its roll out in 2009, but not be fully operational until some time in 2010.The Age: Smartcard System May Face Two Year Delay 5 February 2008 The system was finally introduced on 29 December 2009, but only for metropolitan train services, and was introduced on bus and tram services on 25 July 2010. The two systems would coexist until the transition was complete. Metcard equipment was able to support a similar system based on re-usable RFID touch cards for use by public transport staff and other pass holders, however this provided neither the flexibility nor advantages intended to be available under by the myki system. The new system was announced as a touch on / touch off system, where two validations are required per journey; one when boarding and again when alighting, similar to the London Underground's Oyster card system. This means passengers would have a single card and be charged for the actual fare used (flat rate fare). This is unlike Metcard where passengers who travel into different zones at different days and times may need to buy several types of Metcards beforehand. Touch on / touch off has both benefits and costs. On the one hand, it allows fares to be automatically calculated, always giving the passenger the cheapest fare option and special off-peak fares to encourage travel during quiet times could be implemented, which is impossible with Metcard. The main disadvantage would be to passengers who do not touch off and who would therefore be charged the total fare for the trip they might have taken. Following the change of government in November 2010, an enquiry was held into the future of myki, with various options considered including whether to proceed with it, modify its introduction, or scrap it altogether and retain Metcard. In June 2011, the Victorian Government confirmed that the roll-out of myki would continue and that Metcards would no longer be available after December 2012. Withdrawal A ticket issued during the last hours of Metcard The withdrawal of the Metcard system commenced on 2 January 2012 with the end of online and over-the-phone sales of Metcards, and the removal of yearly Metcards from sale. Other points of sale and Metcard types were progressively removed as Myki sales were introduced Melbourne-wide. Metcard validators at railway stations were also progressively removed, while the process of replacing Metcard gates with Myki gates began. By November 2012, only short-term Metcards (one day or less) could be purchased, and only on board trams and buses. Unused and partially used Metcards could still be used. All remaining Metcards were withdrawn from sale at 3:00 am on 29 December 2012. From this date, remaining Metcard equipment was closed for use. Unused and partially used Metcards were no longer valid tickets. During early 2013, the remaining Metcard gates at railway stations were replaced with Myki gates, while all other remaining Metcard equipment was progressively removed. Below are some of the milestones of the withdrawal of Metcard: * On 2 January 2012, the withdrawal of Metcard began, with the ending of online and over-the-phone sales of Metcards, and the withdrawal of yearly Metcards from sale. * From January to March 2012, Myki sales from vending machines were rolled out across Melbourne metropolitan railway stations, major tram stops and bus interchanges. * From late January to late July 2012, Metcard machines were shut down and removed from Melbourne metropolitan railway stations, commencing with Flagstaff Station in the week of 30 January - 3 February and culminating with the last Metcard vending machine being removed from Southern Cross station during the week of 23‚Äì27 July. Metcard vending machines at other locations were also withdrawn during this time period. * From February to April 2012, Metcards were progressively withdrawn from sale at retail outlets as Myki sales were progressively introduced. * Weekly and monthly Metcards were withdrawn form sale on 26 March 2012, followed by \\"value\\" Metcards (all multi-period, Sunday Saver and off-peak daily Metcards) on 2 July. * From late August 2012, Metcard sales at premium station ticket offices were progressively replaced by Myki sales or top ups, starting at Williamstown Station in the week of 27 August, and ending at Flagstaff station on 12 October. * Starting at Flagstaff station on 12 October 2012, Metcard/Myki hybrid barriers at railway stations were progressively replaced with Myki-only barriers. This process is scheduled to continue through until March 2013. * On 1 November 2012, the PTV Hub (Met Shop) in Swanston Street had ceased its Metcard sales which were replaced by Myki Devices. * On 12 November 2012, the TTA announced that the progressive removal of Metcard validators at railway stations had commenced on a station-by-station basis. All railway station validators were removed by mid-December. * Friday, 28 December 2012, was the final day of Metcard sales on trams and buses, as well as all other Metcard use. After this date, Metcard ticket vending machines on trams have been de- activated, meaning that passengers needed to have a Myki before boarding, or risk a fine. * Starting from 29 December 2012, Metcard equipment including validators on buses and trams were de-activated after its switch off, meaning Melbourne bus passengers have to purchase a Myki before boarding. * Starting from 1 February 2013, Metcard equipment including validators on buses were removed and the new Myki only top-ups and in mid February 2013, Metcard ticket machines and validators on trams were removed and replaced by the full Myki transition. * On 30 June 2013, PTV ceased its Metcard refund and transfer to Myki service, which had allowed people with unused or partly used Metcards to transfer their remaining value to a new or existing Myki card.

Formulation If we allow some real coefficients an, to get the form :\\\\sum_n a_n e(x_n) it is the same as allowing exponents that are complex numbers. Both forms are certainly useful in applications. A large part of twentieth century analytic number theory was devoted to finding good estimates for these sums, a trend started by basic work of Hermann Weyl in diophantine approximation. Estimates The main thrust of the subject is that a sum :S=\\\\sum_n e(x_n) is trivially estimated by the number N of terms. That is, the absolute value :S \\\\le N\\\\, by the triangle inequality, since each summand has absolute value 1. In applications one would like to do better. That involves proving some cancellation takes place, or in other words that this sum of complex numbers on the unit circle is not of numbers all with the same argument. The best that is reasonable to hope for is an estimate of the form :S= O(\\\\sqrt{N})\\\\, which signifies, up to the implied constant in the big O notation, that the sum resembles a random walk in two dimensions. Such an estimate can be considered ideal; it is unattainable in many of the major problems, and estimates :S= o(N)\\\\, have to be used, where the o(N) function represents only a small saving on the trivial estimate. A typical 'small saving' may be a factor of log(N), for example. Even such a minor-seeming result in the right direction has to be referred all the way back to the structure of the initial sequence xn, to show a degree of randomness. The techniques involved are ingenious and subtle. A variant of 'Weyl differencing' investigated by Weyl involving a generating exponential sum G(\\\\tau)= \\\\sum_n e^{iaf(x)+ia\\\\tau n} was previously studied by Weyl himself, he developed a method to express the sum as the value G(0), where 'G' can be defined via a linear differential equation similar to Dyson equation obtained via summation by parts. History If the sum is of the form : S(x)= e^{ia f(x) } where ∆í is a smooth function, we could use the Euler‚ÄìMaclaurin formula to convert the series into an integral, plus some corrections involving derivatives of S(x), then for large values of a you could use \\"stationary phase\\" method to calculate the integral and give an approximate evaluation of the sum. Major advances in the subject were Van der Corput's method (c. 1920), related to the principle of stationary phase, and the later Vinogradov method (c.1930). The large sieve method (c.1960), the work of many researchers, is a relatively transparent general principle; but no one method has general application. Types of exponential sum Many types of sums are used in formulating particular problems; applications require usually a reduction to some known type, often by ingenious manipulations. Partial summation can be used to remove coefficients an, in many cases. A basic distinction is between a complete exponential sum, which is typically a sum over all residue classes modulo some integer N (or more general finite ring), and an incomplete exponential sum where the range of summation is restricted by some inequality. Examples of complete exponential sums are Gauss sums and Kloosterman sums; these are in some sense finite field or finite ring analogues of the gamma function and some sort of Bessel function, respectively, and have many 'structural' properties. An example of an incomplete sum is the partial sum of the quadratic Gauss sum (indeed, the case investigated by Gauss). Here there are good estimates for sums over shorter ranges than the whole set of residue classes, because, in geometric terms, the partial sums approximate a Cornu spiral; this implies massive cancellation. Auxiliary types of sums occur in the theory, for example character sums; going back to Harold Davenport's thesis. The Weil conjectures had major applications to complete sums with domain restricted by polynomial conditions (i.e., along an algebraic variety over a finite field). Weyl sums One of the most general types of exponential sum is the Weyl sum, with exponents 2œÄif(n) where f is a fairly general real-valued smooth function. These are the sums involved in the distribution of the values :∆í(n) modulo 1, according to Weyl's equidistribution criterion. A basic advance was Weyl's inequality for such sums, for polynomial f. There is a general theory of exponent pairs, which formulates estimates. An important case is where f is logarithmic, in relation with the Riemann zeta function. See also equidistribution theorem.Montgomery (1994) p.39 Example: the quadratic Gauss sum Let p be an odd prime and let \\\\xi = e^{2\\\\pi i / p}. Then the Quadratic Gauss sum is given by :\\\\sum_{n=0}^{p-1}\\\\xi^{n^2} = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\sqrt{p}, & p = 1 \\\\mod 4 \\\\ i\\\\sqrt{p}, & p = 3 \\\\mod 4 \\\\end{cases} where the square roots are taken to be positive. This is the ideal degree of cancellation one could hope for without any a priori knowledge of the structure of the sum, since it matches the scaling of a random walk.

Origins He was born at Grace Dieu, near Thringstone in Leicestershire, the second son of the judge Sir Francis Beaumont (d.1598) by his wife Anne Pierrepont. His younger brother was the dramatist Francis Beaumont. Career John matriculated at Broadgates Hall (later Pembroke College) in the University of Oxford on 4 February 1596/1597, entered as a gentleman commoner. He was admitted to the Inner Temple in 1598 or 1600. The death in 1605 of his elder brother, Sir Henry Beaumont, made John the head of the Beaumont family, and he is thought to have returned to Grace-Dieu to manage the family estates.Charles Mosley, editor, Burke's Peerage and Baronetage, 106th edition, 2 volumes (Crans, Switzerland: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 1999), volume 1, page 228.George Edward Cokayne, editor, The Complete Baronetage, 5 volumes (no date (c. 1900); reprint, Gloucester, U.K.: Alan Sutton Publishing, 1983), volume II, p. 5. He was a Roman Catholic and together with his wife was fined for recusancy in 1607, and in 1625 was again in trouble on that account.Skillington, Florence (4 October 1971). \\"Sir John Beaumont of Gracedieu\\" He began to write verse early and in 1602, at the age of nineteen, he published anonymously his Metamorphosis of Tabacco, written in very smooth couplets, in which he addressed Michael Drayton as his loving friend. After long retirement Beaumont was persuaded by the Duke of Buckingham to return to society. He attended court and on 31 January 1626/1627 was created by the king a Baronet \\"of Gracedieu, in Belton, County Leicester\\", in the Baronetage of England. Marriage and children Beaumont lived in Leicestershire for many years as a bachelor, before eventually marrying Elizabeth Fortescue (died after 16 April 1652), daughter of John Fortescue and paternal granddaughter of one of the only two married daughters of Sir Geoffrey Pole and Constance Pakenham. By his wife he had four sons, including: *Sir John Beaumont, 2nd Baronet (d.1643), eldest son and heir, killed at the Siege of Gloucester. He was considered one of the most athletic men of his time. He published some of his father's poems, and wrote an enthusiastic elegy on him. *Gervaise Beaumont, who died in childhood. The circumstances of his death are recorded in one of his father's most touching poems. Death and burial He died in April 1627 and was buried on 19 April 1627 in Westminster Abbey. He died intestate and his estate was administered on 3 January 1628/1629. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son, Sir John Beaumont, 2nd Baronet. Works Beaumont's major work is a poem in twelve books, entitled The Crown of Thornes, which was greatly admired in manuscript by Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton and others. Though lost for centuries, scholars have established that a long poem in twelve books contained in a manuscript in the British Library was indeed Beaumont's lost major work. In 1629 the 2nd Baronet published a volume of his father's works entitled Bosworth Field; with a taste of the variety of other Poems left by Sir John Beaumont. No more tastes were ever vouchsafed, so Beaumont's reputation rests on this the juvenile Metamorphosis of Tobacco. Beaumont's favoured medium was the heroic couplet. Bosworth Field, the scene of the battle described in Beaumont's principal poem, lay close to the poet's residence of Grace-Dieu. He always wrote with a remarkable smoothness, which marks him, with Edmund Waller and George Sandys, as one of the pioneers of the classic reformation of English verse. The poems of Sir John Beaumont were included in Alexander Chalmers's English Poets, vol. vi (1810). An edition, with memorial introduction and notes, was included (1869) in Dr AB Grosart's Fuller Worthies Library; and the Metamorphosis of Tobacco was included in JP Collier's Illustrations of Early English Popular Literature, vol. i. (1863).

A Member of the London Assembly (MLA) from 2000 to 2005, she was Member of Parliament (MP) for Hornsey and Wood Green between 2005 and 2015, before being nominated for a peerage in the Dissolution Peerages List 2015. She was created Baroness Featherstone, of Highgate in the London Borough of Haringey, on 20 October. Under the Conservative ‚Äì Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010 she was appointed as a Home Office Minister with responsibility for criminal information and equalities, before being promoted, in 2012, Minister with responsibility for International Development. Previously she was Liberal Democrat spokesman for Youth and Equality issues, and chair of the Liberal Democrats technology board. As originator and architect of the same sex marriage law during the coalition, Featherstone launched the consultation by the UK Government on introducing same-sex marriage and was the first politician to take part in the Out4Marriage campaign, and returned to the Home Office as Minister of State in November 2014. Featherstone lost her parliamentary seat to Catherine West, the Labour candidate, in 2015, subsequently being nominated by former Deputy PM, the Rt Hon Nick Clegg for a Life Peerage in the Dissolution Honours 2015. Featherstone took her seat as a member of the House of Lords on the Opposition benches on 26 November 2015. Early life Featherstone was born and brought up in North London, and educated at Highgate Primary School, the independent South Hampstead High School (then a direct grant grammar school) and gained a Diploma in Communication and Design at Oxford Polytechnic. Her family business started by her parents was the Ryness chain of lighting and electrical shops in London.The business was sold over a decade ago. Councillor for London Borough of Haringey 1998‚Äì2006 In 1998, Featherstone was elected a Councillor for the London Borough of Haringey representing Muswell Hill Ward. She and her two colleagues (June Andersen and Julia Glenn) were the first three Liberal Democrats to be elected borough councillors. She became Leader of Liberal Democrat Group (and thereby Opposition Leader) on the Council 1998‚Äì2003. Although she stood down from Haringey Council before the May 2006 elections, Featherstone influenced the 2006 local elections in Haringey where Labour's majority was cut from 25 to 3, with 30 Labour Councillors elected to 27 Liberal Democrats. Member of the London Assembly 2000‚Äì2005 From 2000 until 2005, Featherstone was a Member of the London Assembly; during this time, she was Chair of the London Assembly Transport Committee. She was also a member of the Metropolitan Police Authority for all five years she was on the London Assembly. She was replaced as MLA by Geoff Pope. Featherstone was promoted by some as a potential Liberal Democrat candidate for Mayor of London in the 2008 election. In response to a poll on the Liberal Democrat Voice website, she ruled herself out, stating that, of the other people in the poll, she would back Brian Paddick. Member of Parliament A 2015 LibDem election stakeboard for Lynne Featherstone Featherstone first contested the Hornsey and Wood Green seat at the 1997 general election where she finished in third place some 25,998 votes behind the winner Barbara Roche. She again fought Hornsey and Wood Green at the 2001 general election, moving into second place and reducing Roche's majority to 10,614. In one of the largest swings at the 2005 general election, Featherstone defeated Roche with a majority of 2,395 votes. She made her maiden speech in Parliament on 24 May 2005. She was appointed as a LibDem junior Home Affairs spokesperson by Charles Kennedy in 2005, and to the environment audit select committee. She was co-chair of Chris Huhne's unsuccessful campaign to be leader of the Liberal Democrats following the resignation of Kennedy in January 2006. In March, following the election of Menzies Campbell as party leader, she was promoted to number two in the Liberal Democrat home affairs team and made London spokesperson. In December 2006, she succeeded Susan Kramer as the Liberal Democrat Shadow International Development Secretary, and two months later was succeeded by Tom Brake as London spokesperson. In 2007, following the resignation of Sir Menzies Campbell, she again chaired Chris Huhne's leadership election campaign. On 20 December 2007 the new Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, who defeated Chris Huhne, made her Youth and Equalities spokesperson. On 5 February 2013, Featherstone voted in favour in the House of Commons Second Reading vote on same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom, the bill which she spearhead as Minister of State at the Home Office and got passed through the Commons despite Conservative backbench MP resistance. She was given a score of 93% in favour of lesbian, gay and bisexual equality by Stonewall. In the 2015 general election, she lost her seat to Labour's Catherine West MP. Aftermath of death of Peter Connelly Following the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly, Haringey Council initiated an internal audit Serious Case Review (SCR). Although the actual report was completed months earlier, the Executive Summary of the report was released immediately after the resulting court case had completed. The full details of the report have been kept confidential. Featherstone had been particularly critical of Haringey Council, writing \\"I personally met with George Meehan and Ita O'Donovan ‚Äì Haringey Council's Leader and Chief Executive ‚Äì to raise with them three different cases, where the pattern was in each case Haringey seeming to want to blame anyone who complained rather than to look at the complaint seriously. I was promised action ‚Äì but despite repeated subsequent requests for news on progress ‚Äì I was just stonewalled.\\" In November 2008, at Prime Minister's Questions, Featherstone asked the Prime Minister to order an enquiry into the Connelly Case. She was Liberal Democrat Leader of the Opposition on Haringey Council at the time of the murder of Victoria Climbi√©. Media attention In April 2006, one of Featherstone's researchers received a hoax email warning about an apparent date rape drug called Progesterex. Featherstone submitted a question to the Labour Government Minister enquiring as to \\"what assessment he has made of the use of Progesterex in cases of date rape\\". Paul Goggins pronounced to the House of Commons that Progesterex did not exist: \\"It has been the subject of a hoax e-mail\\", he said. The hoax first originated in 1999. Featherstone criticised the Minister's response, stating \\"they need to do more to discover the unearthly monster who sends them out\\" and that \\"their cavalier attitude will not do\\". However, critics such as fellow Liberal Democrat James Graham castigated Featherstone's conduct in \\"criticising the Home Office for not having a response to made up drugs and made up crimes\\", stating \\"trivialising rape in this way without bothering to do basic research first doesn't help anybody\\". She came to the attention of the national media in 2008 when she was criticised by Conservative Member of the London Assembly Brian Coleman for calling 999 (the UK's emergency number) when her boiler began making noises and sparking. Coleman referred to her as a \\"dizzy airhead\\", Featherstone responded by calling his comments \\"sexist\\" and \\"political\\" in nature. A London Fire Brigade spokeswoman told BBC News: \\"If it's obvious that there has been an ongoing problem with the boiler, then you can call a plumber. But if your boiler suddenly starts making strange noises in the middle of the night, call the fire brigade.\\" In January 2013, she tweeted that John Mulholland, editor of The Observer, should have been sacked for publishing a \\"rant against the transgender community\\" in Julie Burchill's column which she described as \\"bigoted vomit\\", receiving a backlash as a result. Featherstone has expressed intentions to ban topless models from appearing on The Sun newspaper's Page 3, stating \\"I would love to take on Page 3\\". Expenses In April 2007, Featherstone was required to return large quantities of parliamentary stationery after her House of Commons office ordered ¬£22,000 worth in the previous month in an attempt to beat new rules on stationery allowances. Featherstone blamed a staff member for the incident, declaring that she \\"knew nothing\\". In a leaked email, parliamentary official Cliff Harris reportedly stated \\"it's quite alarming when you see that Lynne Featherstone spent over ¬£22,000 in one month, the equivalent to three years' of the new-capped rate\\".https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crackdown-on-free-postage-as-labour-mp- claims-50000-on-stationery-7173934.html Featherstone subsequently said she would be putting in place \\"better office procedures\\". In May 2009, Featherstone was listed among the \\"saints\\" by The Daily Telegraph in the expenses scandal. In Government Rt Hon Lynne Featherstone MP launches 16 days of activism for the elimination of violence against women with the Minister of Gender and Child Development, Inonge Wina MP, in Zambia in November 2012. Under the Conservative ‚Äì Liberal Democrat coalition in 2010 she was appointed as a Minister in the Home Office as Parliamentary Under- Secretary for Criminal Information and Equalities. Equalities. Featherstone caused waves by pre-announcing her appointment prior to the official announcement in the expectation of forcing compromises from the Tories regarding her policy \\"aims\\", despite Home Secretary Theresa May being noted for not favouring homosexual equality. In December 2010, Featherstone introduced a move that would allow positive discrimination which is primarily aimed at addressing female under-representation in the workforce. It will also mean that a manager will be able lawfully to hire a black man over a white man, a homosexual man over a heterosexual man, if they have the same skill set. Featherstone, denied the plans were about \\"political correctness, or red tape, or quotas\\" and would \\"help make the workplace fairer\\". In September 2011, Featherstone caused controversy by claiming men make \\"terrible decisions\\" when they are in charge. Speaking at the Liberal Democrat Party Conference Featherstone blamed men for the mess the world was in, and commentators drew parallels with similar comments by one of Featherstone's predecessors, Harriet Harman. Her comments attracted criticism from across the political spectrum and were considered particularly inappropriate given her role as a minister in charge of ending sexism. Conservative MP Priti Patel said: \\"these comments are really ill-thought out. As Equalities Minister she has got to be unbiased about the value that both men and women bring to decision-making.\\" Elizabeth Day of The Observer newspaper was equally troubled by the remarks, writing \\"the notion that women are not as aggressive as men, that we would all just sit around a table eating red velvet cupcakes and talking out the world's problems rather than firing off phallic-shaped nuclear weapons is a complete fallacy\\". On 5 September 2012 she was confirmed as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for International Development. Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference in Glasgow in September 2013, she supported Liberal Democrat policy to prosecute those responsible for cases where girls are sent abroad to have female genital mutilation carried out, or where it is carried out in the UK. In November 2014, she was promoted to Minister of State for Crime Prevention going back to the Home office.  After Government  Featherstone wrote a book, Equal Ever After, describing the details of work to establish legal same-sex marriage in the United Kingdom and her role in the process. Awards In 2006, Featherstone was shortlisted in the \\"Rising Stars\\" category of the Channel 4 political awards, but did not win. She has also been nominated for the prestigious \\"Woman of the Year\\" award. Featherstone was nominated for the Stonewall Politician of the Year Award in both 2009 and 2012 for her work to support equality for lesbian, gay and bisexual people. Lynne was awarded Stonewall Politician of the Year (jointly), Attitude Magazine Politician of the Year and PinkNews Ally of the Year for her initiative on same-sex marriage and work on LGBT rights. Personal life Her nephew was a haemophiliac and victim of the Tainted Blood Scandal. She married Stephen Featherstone in Haringey in 1982, but divorced in 1996; they have two children. Featherstone lives in Highgate, London. She is Jewish. She is an honorary associate of the National Secular Society.

In April 1621 he became colonial treasurer of the Virginia Company and sailed to Virginia with his niece's husband, Sir Francis Wyatt, the new governor. When Virginia became a crown colony, Sandys was created a member of council in August 1624; he was reappointed to this post in 1626 and 1628. In 1631, he vainly applied for the secretaryship to the new special commission for the better plantation of Virginia; soon after this, he returned to England for good. In 1621, he had already published an English translation, written in basic heroic couplets, of part of Ovid's Metamorphoses; this he completed in 1626; on this mainly his poetic reputation rested in the 17th and 18th centuries. Its 1632 edition, featuring extensive commentaries written by Sandys, provided an allegorical reading of Ovid's text. He also began a version of Virgil's Aeneid, but never produced more than the first book. In 1636, he issued his famous Paraphrase upon the Psalms and Hymns dispersed throughout the Old and New Testaments, he translated Christ's Passion from the Latin of Grotius, and, in 1641, he brought out his last work, a Paraphrase of the Song of Songs. He died, unmarried, at Boxley, near Maidstone, Kent, in 1644. His verse was praised by Dryden and Pope; Milton was somewhat indebted to Sandys's Hymn to my Redeemer (inserted in his travels at the place of his visit to the Holy Sepulchre) in his Ode on the Passion.  Travel and travel writing  From The Relation of a Journey begun an. Dom. 1610 On his travels through Europe and the Middle East, he first visited France; from north Italy he passed by way of Venice to Constantinople, and thence to Egypt, Mount Sinai, Palestine, Cyprus, Sicily, Naples, and Rome. His narrative, dedicated, like all his other works, to Charles (either as prince or king), was published in 1615, and formed a substantial contribution to geography and ethnology. Sandys' travel narrative appeared as The Relation of a Journey begun an. Dom. 1610, in four books. This remained a standard account of the Eastern Mediterranean, twice mentioned, for instance, by the English naval chaplain Henry Teonge in his diary of a voyage in 1675. The writing of The Relation series was influenced by Sandys‚Äô background, as he followed the footsteps of his eldest brother who had previously visited and written about Turkey and the Ottoman Empire.Ellison, 2002, p. 66 This work contributed to the debates concerning religious tolerance in the early 17th century: Sandys shows that contrary to beliefs of many Western Europeans, multiple religions did not automatically cause social unrest, as exemplified in his descriptions of the Ottoman Empire.Ellison, 2002, p. 77 Sandys also appears to have been one of the first non-Jewish travelers to refute the belief that Jews ‚Äúnaturally emit an unsavoury odour‚Äù.Ellison, 2002, p. 80 The book was well-received in his time, becoming a standard account of the Eastern Mediterranean, although Sandys has later been critiqued for his attitude towards women in his writing by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu.Montagu, M. W. (1763). Turkish Embassy Letters. United Kingdom: Becket and De Hondt. The seventh edition of The Relation of a Journey begun an. Dom. 1610, in four books combined the four books into a single volume, printed for John Williams junior at The Crown in Little Britain in London, 1673. This compilation volume included Sandys‚Äô travels to all above mentioned locations, the first book containing a history of the state of the Turkish Empire, describing their laws, government, policy, military, justice system and commerce. The first book also included Sandys‚Äô description of the Mohammedan religion (Islam), a description of Constantinople and the manner of living of its sultan, and a study of Greece and Greek religion and customs. The second book of The Relation of a Journey focused on Egypt and the surrounding area. Sandys gives an account of Egyptian antiquity and culture, as well as his voyage on the Nile river. The second book also includes descriptions of Armenia, Cairo, Rhodes, and a brief history of Alexandria, in decline during the time of Sandys‚Äô visitation. The third book of the series is a description of Palestine, the Holy Land and the Jewish and Christians living there at the time. In the fourth and final volume of the series present in the compilation Sandys Travels, Sandys discusses Italy and describes the islands near it: Cyprus, Crete, Malta, Sicily and the Aeolian Islands. The final volume also includes Sandys‚Äô account of cities and other places of note he visited, amongst which Venice, where his journey began, and Rome. The compilation of these four works, Sandys Travels, includes fifty maps and images. Theology Sandys adopted English Arminian theological views that were reflected in his writings. He included anti-calvinist commentaries in his Paraphrase upon the Psalms\\" (1636). He latter translated Christus Patiens (1639) a theological and political drama of Arminian theologian Hugo Grotius. Family His brother Edwin Sandys (same name as his father) was a politician and an influential member of the London Virginia Company.

He was born in Gothenburg in 1748 to the Scottish merchant, William Chalmers, Sr., and his Swedish wife, Inga Orre. William Chalmers Jr. was the oldest amongst his brothers James, George Andreas and Charles Chalmers. He became a director of the Swedish East India Company and in 1783 he was appointed as their resident representative in Canton. He would stay there and in Macau for ten years before returning home. He died in Gothenburg in 1811 leaving half his fortune to the Sahlgrenska hospital, Gothenburg. After some other donations, the remainder was donated to create a crafting school for poor children, which in 1829 became a college, that today is named the Chalmers University of Technology.  Education  William Chalmers studied commercial & marketing in Gothenburg and United Kingdom, before continuing his studies in a travelling manner to France and Holland. At the age of 35, he was nominated to become the purchaser of the Swedish East India Company in Canton, China which became his most enriching investment.  Swedish East India Company  In 1793, when Chalmers was 45 years old, he had been living in Canton for ten years. Afterwards, he returned to Sweden as the manager of the Swedish East India Company as well as the manager of Trollh√§tte Kanalverk (a canal that runs through Trollh√§ttan). He faithfully contributed to the finalization of the canal and was able to leave the company seven years later (1800). Six years post the finalization of the canal, the last Swedish East India Company-ship arrived into Sweden. On it was merchandise from China and Spain. The imports from Spain and China allowed Sweden to widen its international relations, thus the porcelain from China and the silver from Spain was exported to other countries, as well as Sweden's own products: wood, iron and artillery.

It is endemic to a small area of the coastal mountains of south-eastern Brazil where its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist forests. It is the parent or one of the parents of the houseplants called Christmas cactus or Thanksgiving cactus, among other names. Description Schlumbergera truncata resembles other species of the genus Schlumbergera in that it has leafless green stems which act as photosynthetic organs. The stems (cladodes) are composed of strongly flattened segments, which have two or three \\"teeth\\" of varying shapes along their edges and at the ends. The ends of the stems are \\"cut off\\" (truncated) rather than pointed. Individual segments are about long by wide. Special structures characteristic of cacti, called \\"areoles\\", occur between two teeth at the end of segments. The areoles, which have brown wool and bristles up to long, are where the flower buds appear. The flowers are held at a constant angle somewhat above the horizontal with the higher side different from the lower side (zygomorphic, specifically bilaterally symmetrical). The flowers are about long by across. There are six to eight tepals, which may be of various colours, including shades of red, orange, pink and white. The outer tepals (those at the base of the flower) are shorter and bent backwards, the inner tepals are longer and fused together at the base to form a floral tube; nectar is produced at the base of this tube. The lower inner petals are bent backwards so that the upper inner petals appear longer. Plants flower in the autumn: around May in their natural habitat, in October to November in cultivation in the Northern Hemisphere; short days and long nights are necessary to induce flowering. A characteristic of the genus Schlumbergera is that the many stamens are arranged in two series: the inner stamens form a ring around the style; the outer stamens arise from the floral tube. The filaments of the stamens are white, the anthers and pollen being yellow. The style has six to eight lobes at its end and is dark red. When ripe, the fruit is red, pear-shaped, and about long or exceptionally up to long. The shiny seeds are black, each with a diameter of about . Taxonomy The epithet truncata means \\"abruptly cut off\\", and refers to the shape of the ends of the stems. The species was first properly named for science by Haworth in 1819 as Epiphyllum truncatum. His name was based on living specimens growing at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in 1818. (However these do not appear to have been preserved, so an illustration published by W.J. Hooker in 1822 was designated as the \\"neotype\\" by N.P. Taylor.) Like others in the genus, the species was transferred to Zygocactus by Schumann in 1890, and then to Schlumbergera by Moran in 1953. Some other names in the genus Epiphyllum are now considered to be synonyms of S. truncata. Synonyms include: *Cactus truncatus Hooker, nomen nudum *Epiphyllum truncatum Haw. *Cactus truncatus (Haw.) Link *Cereus truncatus (Haw.) Sweet *Zygocactus truncatus (Haw.) K.Schum. *Epiphyllum altensteinii Pfeif. *Zygocactus altensteinii (Pfeif.) K.Schum. *Epiphyllum delicatum N.E.Br. *Zygocactus delicatum (N.E.Br.) Britton & Rose *Epiphyllum ruckeri Paxton Epiphyllum bridgesii Lem., Schlumbergera bridgesii (Lem.) Loefgr. and Epiphyllum ruckerianum sensu Lem. have sometimes been treated as synonyms of S. truncata, but are regarded by David Hunt as synonyms of the hybrid S. √ó buckleyi. Distribution and habitat Schlumbergera truncata occurs only in a small area of the coastal mountains of south-east Brazil, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, located in the southernmost part of the tropics. Sites where it has been found include the Organ Mountains (Serra dos √ìrg√£os) in the Parque Nacional da Serra dos √ìrg√£os and in the Serra do Mar near to the city of Rio de Janeiro. Plants grow at altitudes of . Because of their altitude and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, the coastal mountains have high humidity ‚Äì warm moist air is forced upwards into higher, colder locations where it condenses. S. truncata usually grows on trees (epiphytic), or on rocks (epilythic). The native status of S. truncata has become confused because European cultivars were deliberately introduced into some areas, including the Parque Nacional da Serra dos √ìrg√£os, by the Brazilian Agricultural Department, to compensate for over-collecting of wild plants. Cultivation Schlumbergera truncata is mainly grown as cultivars of the species or of its hybrids with other species of the genus, particularly S. russelliana. These plants and their cultivation are discussed at Schlumbergera: Cultivation.

He is a former Director-General (1992‚Äì2000) of the BBC. After a successful career in commercial television, initially at Granada Television and later at London Weekend Television, Birt was appointed Deputy Director-General of the BBC in 1987 for his expertise in current affairs. The forced departure of Director-General Alasdair Milne after pressure from the Thatcher governmentAlasdair Milne, DG: The Memoirs of a British Broadcaster, 1988 required someone near the top, preferably from outside the BBC, with editorial and production experience (Milne had been summarily replaced by Michael Checkland, an accountant). During his tenure as Director-General, Birt restructured the BBC, in the face of much internal opposition. However, others have credited him with saving the corporation from possible government privatisation, and say he prepared for the era of digital broadcasting. After leaving the BBC, Birt was Strategic Advisor to Prime Minister Tony Blair from 2001‚Äì5. He was appointed Chairman of CPA Global in 2015. Early life and commercial television career Birt was born in Liverpool to a Catholic father, a manager at the Firestone tyre company, and a Protestant mother. He was raised as a Catholic, and educated at the direct- grant grammar school St Mary's College, Liverpool and read engineering at St Catherine's College, Oxford, graduating from Oxford University with a third- class degree in engineering. From 1966 to 1971, Birt worked for Granada Television, where he devised and produced the magazine programme Nice Time before joining Granada's World in Action current affairs series. Birt persuaded Mick Jagger, who had just spent three nights in Brixton prison for possession of drugs, to participate in a 1967 edition of World in Action in which Jagger conversed with the editor of The Times (William Rees-Mogg) and the Bishop of Woolwich (John A. T. Robinson), among others. It was hailed as a \\"dialogue between generations.\\" With Gus Macdonald, Birt became joint editor of World in Action in 1969. Birt moved from Granada to London Weekend Television in 1971. At LWT he was the founding editor and executive producer of the current affairs programme Weekend World. He became head of current affairs at LWT and, later, controller of features and current affairs. With Weekend World presenter Peter Jay, Birt contributed a series of three articles to The Times on the topic of television journalism. They argued that most television news and current affairs contained a \\"bias against understanding\\": pictures had taken precedence over analysis. Instead they advocated \\"a mission to explain\\". Makers of news and documentary programmes were required to outline their finished product in writing before setting out with a camera crew. Such an argument, was not universally accepted. Years later, in 2006, Alasdair Milne, the former BBC Director General, said he thought Birt's \\"bias against understanding\\" argument was nonsense. In the mid-1970s, he took a break from LWT to produce David Frost's The Nixon Interviews with the disgraced former US President Richard Nixon. In the 1977 interviews, watched by 45 million people, Nixon admitted his part in the scandal which had led to his resignation. Birt returned to LWT as director of programmes in 1982. During this period he revived the career of his old friend, the Liverpool singer Cilla Black, who in due course became the highest-paid female performer on UK television. Birt formed a close working relationship with his boss at LWT, Michael Grade, although this would later sour when both were working at the BBC.John Birt,The Harder Path, 2002. BBC career Birt's success at LWT prompted the BBC's governors to appoint him deputy director-general in 1987 under Michael Checkland. Birt also served as the BBC's director of news and current affairs at this time. Birt's promotion to Director-General in 1992 caused controversy when it was revealed he was employed on a freelance consultancy basis. Under political and public pressure, Birt became a BBC employee. He had to sell his shares in LWT, losing out on a windfall of what would have been several million pounds when it was bought by Granada in 1994. The Sunday Times later revealed that Birt had been a member of the Labour Party at the time of his appointment, a concern to Conservatives who had already expressed concerns about alleged left-wing bias at the organisation. As Director General, Birt was tasked with securing the BBC's future at a time of rapid technical, cultural and economic changes in world broadcasting. In seven years, Birt restructured and modernised the corporation which he wanted to make \\"the best managed public sector organisation\\". Birt imposed a policy of radical change to deliver efficiency savings. In April 1993 he introduced Producer Choice, giving programme makers the power to buy services from outside the BBC. This theoretically reduced the cost to licence-payers of the BBC's historic resource base. Faced with high rental fees from the BBC's record library, producers found it cheaper to buy records from local record shops. In-house facilities were closed or stood idle, allegedly as a result of Birt's \\"creative accounting\\" methods. Above all, Birt is credited with preparing the organisation for the new landscape shaped by digitalisation ‚Äì preparations that were \\"far in advance of the BBC‚Äôs terrestrial rivals\\", according to the academic Georgina Born. At the 1996 Edinburgh Television Festival, Birt said that without the resources to prepare for the digital age, the BBC would be \\"history\\".Georgina Born (2005) Uncertain Vision: Birt, Dyke and the reinvention of the BBC. Vintage. Birt asserted that the changes made the BBC more agile, more competitive and allowed it to expand beyond its traditional broadcasting services, but remaining licence-fee funded. He was one of the driving forces behind the launch of continuous news output and he took much money from traditional services to fund the 24-hour news channel and advance on the internet. However, such ventures were criticised by many as being clearly detrimental to BBC core programming. It has been argued by Birt that without his changes and his readiness to appease the Thatcher government, the BBC's operating charter might not have been renewed in the 1990s. Birt's advocates include the journalists John Lloyd, John Simpson and Polly Toynbee. Birt's use of impenetrable jargon became known as \\"Birtspeak\\", a phenomenon mocked in the satirical magazine Private Eye, complete with a miniature Dalek caricature of Birt. The comparison originated from playwright Dennis Potter, who labeled Birt a \\"croak-voiced Dalek\\" in his MacTaggart Lecture delivered in August 1993 at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. The BBC's post-production department made a Christmas tape casting Birt as Davros, the head of the Daleks, which was alluded to many years later on a BBC DVD commentary for Genesis of the Daleks by former director David Maloney.Voice- over commentary on the BBC DVD \\"Genesis of the Daleks\\" (1975, 2006) Journalist Mark Lawson wrote at the time that Potter's \\"tendency towards unfocused vitriol and noisy self-examination made his contribution easily swattable by the BBC's damage controllers\\". Birt himself did not agree with his critics' portrait of the BBC of the time, but did allow that drama was a source of concern. \\"The originality is not there as it was in the Sixties\\", he said. One of Birt's predecessors, Alasdair Milne, said Birt did little good for the BBC apart from establishing its internet service and criticised him for paying consultants large fees for the corporation's restructuring. Many others opposed Birt, his methods and his reforms, including the journalists John Tusa, Mark Tully and Charles Wheeler, and news correspondent Kate Adie. Radio broadcaster John Dunn believed morale was bad under Birt, while David Attenborough commented that producers spend too much time worrying about money as a result of Birt's reforms. Birt's arrival at the BBC hastened the departure of executive Bill Cotton, who described his tenure as a \\"nightmare\\" for the BBC. Marmaduke Hussey, who appointed Birt to his BBC role, later claimed to have regrets. Some of Birt's changes were partially dismantled by his successors Greg Dyke and Mark Thompson. However, producer Tony Garnett claimed in 2009 that Birt's legacy of \\"totalitarian micro management\\" has existed at the BBC ever since. In 1998, Birt imposed a ban on BBC output mentioning the private life of Peter Mandelson. This order followed an edition of Newsnight, during which Matthew Parris had said that Mandelson was homosexual. Peter Ainsworth, the Conservative shadow Culture Secretary, questioned whether this was a generic ban on mentioning private issues or specific to Mandelson. Birt was succeeded as Director-General by Greg Dyke who also had ties to the Labour Party. Post-BBC career=Advisor to Tony Blair Birt was brought into Number 10 to lead the development of long-term strategy for the government on key areas of public policy. Tony Blair asked him to produce a report on solutions to crime, and he served as advisor on Criminal Justice from 2000‚Äì2001. The establishment of a Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) was an idea originally conceived by Birt.Anthony Seldon,Blair Unbound 2007 Birt was made unpaid Strategy Adviser to Blair in 2001, appointed for what was termed \\"blue skies thinking\\" and claimed by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott to be \\"worth every penny\\"; Blair wanted advice from outside the traditional Whitehall mindset ‚Äì he had known Birt since the 1980s and approved of his analytical approach. Jeremy Heywood, Blair's principal private secretary, said: \\"He liked the way that John was willing to get right down into the data and understand the evidence, and come up with a real sense that you could do things in a totally different way.\\" Birt supervised the development of long-term strategy on drugs, health, crime reduction, education, transport and London. His 2004 report on drug policy recommended making heroin use a criminal offence on par with possession.Anthony Seldon,New crackdown on heroin users 2007 However, Birt's recommendations made him unpopular with some ministers and Blair's decision to ask Birt for a \\"private\\" report on crime irritated Jack Straw and the Home Office. In 2002, he proposed a second network of motorways operated as tolls to counter the problems of traffic congestion.road network 'planned for UK' Many saw Birt's role in government as controversial, since as a special advisor, rather than a civil servant, he was not formally obliged to face questions from House of Commons select committees. In October 2002 it emerged that the government had specifically asked him not to appear in front of the transport select committee, at a time when he was in charge of long-term transport strategy. Blair asked Birt to help him define his main domestic policy priorities so he could develop precise plans for the period after the 2005 election. Birt had first proposed the idea of the \\"five-year plans\\" in 2003 and was now responsible for overseeing the Third Term Plan. This included the overall policy programme, machinery of government changes and the legislative timetable. A special project team to develop the third term was led by Birt and Turnbull and reported regularly to the prime minister. Birt's team produced detailed proposals with a precise grid on how to implement policy. Concurrently, Birt served as an advisor at McKinsey & Company's Global Media Practice from 2000‚Äì2005. His relationship with government and McKinsey caused some controversy as McKinsey were increasingly working with UK government departments in a range of public service and defence areas.Rachel Stevenson \\"Birt quits McKinsey over conflict of interest fears\\", The Independent, 13 July 2005 Birt remained at Number 10 as an unpaid adviser until December 2005, when he left to join private equity firm Terra Firma Capital Partners as an adviser. The Financial Times reported at the beginning of July 2005 that Birt's office ceiling at No 10 Downing Street had fallen in. However, Birt was not injured.Blue sky' Birt's ceiling falls Later business career From 2006 to 2010, he was an adviser for consulting firm Capgemini on strategic issues, with a focus on the public sector and its Telecom, Media and Entertainment practice. Birt served as chairman of Lynx New Media (subsequently Lynx Capital Ventures) from 2000 to 2004. He was chairman of Waste Recycling Group and subsequently non-executive director of Infinis, one of the UK's leading generators of renewable power. He also served chairman of Maltby Capital from 2007‚Äì2010.Terra Firma Birt was chairman of PayPal Europe between 2010 and 2014, having joined the board in 2004. He later served periods as chairman of Host Europe Group (2013-2017) and CPA Global (2015-2017). He is currently Vice-Chairman of Eutelsat, having joined the board as an independent director in 2006. Honours and awards Birt received an Emmy in 1995, for his\\"outstanding contribution\\" to international television. Birt was awarded a knighthood,Official announcement knighthood. The London Gazette 30 December 1999 and on 11 February 2000 he was created a life peer as Baron Birt, of Liverpool in the County of Merseyside. He took his seat in the House of Lords in March 2000 as a crossbencher. Crossbencher in the House of Lords Birt is an active cross-bencher in the House of Lords, speaking out in 2011 and 2012 in favour of government's proposed Health and Social Care Bill. Birt's special interests include the Media/ Broadcasting/ Communications Industry, Climate Change/ Environment, Criminal Justice and Education In 2013 Birt voiced his opinion to the House of Lords about his views on the Gay Marriage bill stating ‚Äòthis bill goes the whole hog and rightly allows gay couples, if they wish, to make the powerful statements of love and commitment that marriage proclaims. If gay couples want that option, they should have it.‚Äô In 2014 Birt showed his support for the assisted dying legislation, in the House of Lords debate, in which participants were evenly split. Before the 2014 Scottish referendum, Bird argued that Scottish independence would have a devastating impact on the BBC. In 2015, he led criticism of the decision for the BBC to start funding TV licences for over-75s, calling it a 'deeply shocking announcement'. Later reflections on broadcasting career Returning to his earlier career on 26 August 2005, Birt delivered his second MacTaggart lecture at the Edinburgh International Television Festival. Partly a review of his professional life as a broadcaster, he also criticised the \\"tabloidisation\\" of intellectual concerns. More importantly, he argued that Channel 4 should receive financial help, in order to preserve \\"public service broadcasting\\", which was taken as advocacy of the BBC sharing its licence fee with Channel Four, so called \\"top slicing\\". He also mentioned that his long-standing feud with Michael Grade had been resolved, but the speech as a whole was not admired by many figures in the industry. Following Director General George Entwistle‚Äôs resignation in November 2012, James Purnell argued that the new Director General \\"should learn from the Birt era\\" stating that it was Birt's \\"boldness\\" that saved the BBC. Instead of playing it safe and avoiding mistakes, he said, Birt transformed output and embraced the internet, and rebuilt relationships with government, business and the public. Media commentator Steve Hewlett, Birt's former colleague and friend, suggested in 2012 that it might be time for the BBC \\"to bring in Birt 2.0\\". Hewlett acknowledged that many of Birt's reforms were unpopular, but said that without them, \\"it is questionable whether the BBC would exist in anything like its present capable and competitive form, or indeed would have retained the huge affection of audiences\\". Private life John Birt's first wife was the American-born Jane Lake. They met in 1963, whilst she was an art student at Oxford. The couple married in Washington in 1965, and have two children, and five grandchildren. In April 2005, Birt admitted a twelve-month affair with Eithne Wallis, a divorced mother of three and a former head of the National Probation Service.Birt divorces his wife of 40 years for a new love Times Online Birt admitted adultery in his court papers.

The film, written by William Osborne and Michael McCullers, was released on 20 July 2004 in the United Kingdom and 30 July 2004 in the United States. The film's plot concerns the Hood, who traps International Rescue (IR) leader Jeff Tracy and four of his sons on board the damaged Thunderbird 5 to steal the other Thunderbirds vehicles and commit heists that IR will be blamed for, prompting Jeff's youngest son Alan and his friends Tin-Tin and Fermat to stop him. In contrast with the original TV series, which used a form of puppetry dubbed \\"Supermarionation\\", the film's characters are portrayed by live-action actors. The film received negative reviews from critics and fans of the series, who disparaged its lack of fidelity to its source material, and was a box office bomb. Gerry Anderson was also negative about the film, describing it as \\"the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life\\", although Sylvia Anderson praised it as a \\"great tribute\\" to the series. The film's soundtrack includes the song \\"Thunderbirds Are Go\\" by pop rock band Busted, which peaked at number one in the UK charts and later won the 2004 UK Record of the Year award. Plot The Tracy family, led by former astronaut Jeff Tracy, operate International Rescue (IR), a secret organization that aids those in need during disasters using the technologically advanced machines called Thunderbirds, operating out of Tracy Island in the South Pacific. The youngest son Alan lives at a boarding school in Massachusetts and dreams of being a Thunderbird pilot. He and his friend Fermat Hackenbacker, son of the Thunderbirds‚Äô engineer Brains, are extracted by Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, an IR agent, and her butler Aloysius Parker, using her limo FAB 1, as the Thunderbirds return from an oil rig fire off the Russian coast. Unbeknownst to them, a tracking beacon used by the Hood, a psychic criminal mastermind who has a vendetta against Jeff for not saving him in a collapsing diamond mine when his brother Kyrano was rescued, has been planted on the hull of Thunderbird 1. The Hood's submarine locates Tracy Island and fires a missile at the orbiting Thunderbird 5, sending the Tracys in Thunderbird 3 to rescue John Tracy. The Hood and his minions Mullion and Transom take over the island's command centre, imprisoning the Tracys in Thunderbird 5 as their oxygen runs out. The Hood reveals that he plans to use the Thunderbirds to rob the major banks of the world, which would plunge the world's monetary system into chaos and the IR organization will be blamed and disgraced for it. Alan, Fermat and their friend Tin-Tin, Kyrano's daughter, use a ventilation shaft to reach the Thunderbird silos. Fermat removes Thunderbird 2s guidance chip, delaying their plan, and the teenagers flee into the island's jungle. While traversing the jungle to find the island's remote transmitter, Tin-Tin displays psychic powers like her uncle. Alan insists on confronting the villains, but Jeff tells them to wait for Lady Penelope's arrival. The trio flee from Mullion, but Fermat and Tin-Tin are captured when Alan tries to tow them to safety on hovercraft. Lady Penelope and Parker arrive, engaging the Hood's minions in combat, but the Hood defeats them with his powers. Alan appears but the Hood forces him to hand over the guidance chip and locks him and the others in the compound's walk-in freezer. The Hood, Mullion, and Transom pilot Thunderbird 2 to London and use the Mole to sink a monorail line into the Thames and drill into the Bank of England‚Äôs vaults. Alan and co. escape confinement and contact the Tracys who regain control of Thunderbird 5. While the adults head off to stop the Hood, the teenagers, Lady Penelope, and Parker fly to London in Thunderbird 1. Arriving in London, Alan and Tin-Tin rescue a submerged monorail car using the aquatic Thunderbird 4 before going after the Hood. Together, Fermat, Tin-Tin and Parker manage to defeat the Hood's henchmen. The Hood locks Jeff and Lady Penelope in a vault and challenges Alan to defeat him. Alan dangles from a catwalk over the Mole, but Tin-Tin appears, using her own powers to turn the tables on the Hood. The Hood taunts Alan to let him die like his father did, but Alan, knowing that his father had in fact tried but failed to save the Hood, rescues him because \\"that's what (they) do\\". The Hood and his minions are arrested and the Tracys return to their island. Alan, Fermat and Tin-Tin are inducted as official members of IR, and depart for their first mission.

It was preceded by Thunderbirds Are Go in 1966 and Thunderbird 6 in 1968, both films using the Supermarionation production techniques of the series. Production of the film started in the mid 1990s when Polygram purchased the rights to the entire ITC Entertainment library, which included the original Thunderbirds series. Seeing the big-screen potential of the series, Peter Hewitt was signed on to direct, while Karey Kirkpatrick was signed on to write. While Hewitt was a lifelong fan of the series, Kirkpatrick was not, but watched all 32 episodes of the original series to immerse himself within the lore of the series. Hewitt and Kirkpatrick wrote a draft of the screenplay which was faithful to the series, but which they hoped would not alienate audiences who were unfamiliar with the franchise. Their script featured The Hood trying to steal Tracy Island's power core to power a device controlled by arch villain Thaddeus Stone, which would transfer all of Earth's gravity to the moon. After four drafts, Kirkpatrick left the project due to Working Title's concerns that the film would not play well in the US market. (Working Title was the unit of Polygram, and later Universal when that company bought out Polygram's assets, that produced films in Britain.) Hewitt left the production shortly afterwards due to his dislike for the new direction the film was taking. Filming began in March 2003 in the Seychelles, before moving to Pinewood Studios and on-location shooting in London. Thunderbirds is dedicated to the memory of Stephen Lowen, a rigger on the film, who died in a fall whilst dismantling one of the sets. Release Thunderbirds was theatrically released on 24 July 2004 in the United Kingdom and 30 July 2004 in the United States by Universal Studios and was released on VHS & DVD on December 21, 2004 by Universal Studios Home Entertainment. Reception The FAB 1 car designed by Ford of Europe for the film. Box office Thunderbirds grossed $28,283,637, and with an estimated $57 million budget, the film was a box office bomb. Critical response The film received negative reviews from both critics and the fanbase. Those familiar with the series tended to be more negative, accusing the filmmakers of abandoning the concepts of the original series in favour of a Spy Kids approach, with many reviewers dubbing it \\"Thunderbirds Are No-Go!\\" (a riff on the catchphrase from the original series, \\"Thunderbirds are go!\\"). The addition of Brains' son, Fermat, also irritated many fans as he receives more screen time than Brains. Empire gave the film two out of five stars.https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/thunderbirds-review/ Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 19% \\"rotten\\" rating and a consensus calling the film a \\"Live-action cartoon for kids.\\"https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/thunderbirds Yahoo! Movies and Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C+ rating. Metacritic gave the film 36 of 100, indicating \\"generally unfavourable reviews\\". One of the few aspects of the film to receive positive acclaim (other than the special effects) was Sophia Myles' performance as IR agent Lady Penelope, a portrayal in a style identical to that of her television counterpart. Another positive view was Ron Cook as Lady Penelope's butler and chauffeur Parker. The Thunderbirds craft, as well as Tracy Island, were also seen to be very close to the style of the original designs. Purists disliked the fact that FAB-1, Lady Penelope's car, was a Ford rather than a Rolls-Royce. However, this was because the producers could not reach a suitable agreement with BMW in the authorised use of the Rolls-Royce marque; the car manufacturer insisted that only an actual production model could be used. Ford stepped in with a special version of their Thunderbird model, duplicating the six-wheel system on the Supermarionation Rolls. FAB-1 steers with the four front tyres. The Ford Motor Company supplied a number of vehicles to the production, including an advanced off-road vehicle which prominently sported the Ford logo, a Ford Windstar, a Ford Ka and Ford Thunderbird which are owned by Lady Penelope, as well as many Ford C-MAX and Ford F-150s in various locations, leading to jeers over the too-obvious level of product placement by the car manufacturers - a sentiment actually shared by director Frakes, as revealed in the DVD audio commentary. During development, creator Gerry Anderson was invited to act as creative consultant, but was left out when the studio felt there were enough employees on the payroll acting as part of the creative team. The studio offered him $750,000 (¬£432,000) to attend the premiere but Anderson could not accept money from people he had not worked for. He eventually saw the film on DVD and was disappointed, declaring \\"It was disgraceful that such a huge amount of money was spent with people who had no idea what Thunderbirds was about and what made it tick.\\" He also said that it was \\"the biggest load of crap I have ever seen in my entire life.\\" Co-creator Sylvia Anderson, and the one responsible for character development, was given a private screening of the film and attended the London premiere. She expressed a far different opinion to that of her former husband, stating \\"I felt that I'd been on a wonderful Thunderbirds adventure. You, the fans, will I'm sure, appreciate the sensitive adaptation and I'm personally thrilled that the production team have paid us the great compliment of bringing to life our original concept for the big screen. If we had made it ourselves (and we have had over 30 years to do it!) we could not have improved on this new version. It is a great tribute to the original creative team who inspired the movie all those years ago. It was a personal thrill for me to see my characters come to life on the big screen.\\" Timed to coincide with the theatrical release of Thunderbirds, the two prior films were released on DVD. The DVD versions of all three films include a number of extra features, including historical and production information. Differences from the original There are notable changes from the original series. The most obvious difference is the updated effects and new designs of the Thunderbird craft. The majority were given a sleeker and modern look; however, they were still based on their original designs, with Thunderbirds 4 and 5 deviating the most from their original look. The layout of Tracy Island, as well as the inside of the house, had also been overhauled. The way in which the Tracy Brothers make their descent to the hangars changed, with them now all standing in front of their pictures on the wall, instead of there being a specific place for them to stand in the lounge to get to a specific craft. Additionally the couch loading mechanism is now used in Thunderbird 2 as well, rather than just being for Thunderbird 3, but uses a robotic arm instead of the system of rails. Lady Penelope's FAB 1 vehicle was changed to being a Ford Thunderbird instead of a Rolls-Royce and can now seat only two people as well as being able to turn into a jet plane. Thunderbird 3 was also shown to dock with Thunderbird 5 differently; in the film it docks side on instead of the rocket head going into the space station. The organisation is also referred to more commonly as \\"Thunderbirds\\" rather than \\"International Rescue\\"; although on their induction at the end of the film Alan, Tin-Tin, and Fermat receive badges that are designed with the \\"IR\\" logo on them as per the original TV series, indicating that the team are still officially called this (it even says in the trailer and in the introduction to the film that the organization is called International Rescue and that Thunderbirds is a nickname that derives from the names of their machines). As if to reinforce this point, it worth noting that this version of Thunderbird 2, unlike the original, has the words \\"International Rescue\\" across its body, under the cockpit section. Nonetheless, in the films it seems that use of the informal organisational name \\"Thunderbirds\\" has become the norm, and has been adopted by the family members themselves for everyday use. In the film the dramatic emphasis was changed dramatically from the television series in that the younger characters Tin-Tin, Alan Tracy, and Fermat Hackenbacker (Brains's son) have the most prominent roles. In the original, however, Alan Tracy does sometimes have a larger role than the others and certainly a more emotional storyline (especially in the Thunderbirds Are Go! movie),. but he has never been the main character. In the original series, Alan and Tin-Tin were much closer to the age of the rest of the Tracy brothers; with Alan being captain of Thunderbird 3 which can be seen from the opening title sequence of the very first episode.Episode 01. Fermat Hackenbacker was seen only in the film, because there is no mention of Brains ever being married, least of all having had a son. In the original series, Brains' name was never officially revealed, with \\"Hiram Hackenbacker\\" merely an alias (as seen in the episode \\"Alias Mr. Hackenbacker\\"); Episode 29. in the film it appears to be his actual name. However, since no mention of this is made by other characters, it is possible also that Brains used 'Hiram Hackenbacker' as an alias when he and Transom first met, so she would perhaps have assumed it was his real name. Also Jeff Tracy never flew any of the Thunderbirds craft, and there has never been an instance where he went off to the danger zone (with the exception of the episode \\"Brink of Disaster\\", Episode 11. as he was caught in the accident). Like Fermat, the character of Onaha is not from the original TV series, where Kyrano was a single parent and presumably, like Jeff Tracy, a widower. In addition, the TV series has \\"Kyrano\\" as the family name, with Kyrano's first name never being revealed. Jeff's mother (known simply as Grandma in the TV series) does not feature or get mentioned during the film. Tin-Tin and Kyrano change nationality in the film as well; they had been Malaysian throughout the TV series but were depicted as being from India in the film. Other changes are more canonical. The feature film is set in 2010 (taken from publicity material) while the original is set in 2065 (i.e. the date now accepted by many fans in Thunderbirds canon as the year of International Rescue's first mission, although it says on the back of the DVD that the film is set in 2065).The Complete Gerry Anderson: The Authorised Episode Guide, p. 95. In the feature film, the Hood said that he was left for dead in one of International Rescue's earlier missions, but in \\"Trapped in the Sky\\"‚Äîwhich was stated as International Rescue's first mission‚Äîhe was already trying to get their technology, of whose existence he knew via Kyrano. A huge difference in the film is the International Rescue uniforms. The film had dropped the original and recognisable concept of the blue uniform with coloured sashes and hat. (The original hat does make a brief cameo in the film however; an ice cream seller, portrayed by the film's visual effects director Mark Nelmes, is seen wearing one during the sequence where Thunderbird 2 lands in London.) In the film, they wear grey modern astronaut uniforms with coloured piping - the colour depends on which Thunderbird machine they handle. They have no similarities to the original design. Lady Penelope also wears an International Rescue uniform in the film, which she never wore in the series. Another notable difference between the 2004 film and the original TV series is that International Rescue now allows itself to be filmed and photographed on missions. One of the recurring \\"rules\\" in the original TV series was that under no circumstances was anything related to International Rescue‚Äîbe it the pilots or the craft themselves‚Äîpermitted to be photographed. For example, in the episode \\"Terror in New York City\\", Scott Tracy electromagnetically wipes a recording of Thunderbird 1 when news crew starts filming. Episode 13. A further difference is that the Hood is actually referred to by name in the film (unlike the TV series), although his name did appear in spin-off media such as comics. The use of his powers seem to make him weaker when he uses them, and his eyes are red; whereas in the original series they were always a bright yellow. In contrast to the TV series, Tin-Tin actually shares the same powers as her uncle, the Hood, as seen in the film's finale. In the TV series, Gordon Tracy was the aquanaut and pilot of Thunderbird 4, while Alan was the astronaut and pilot of Thunderbird 3, with John Tracy subbing on occasion. In the film, the roles are reversed. However, as Alan uses Thunderbird 4 only during the climax when Gordon is unavailable, it may be that Gordon is trained to pilot both craft in the film's continuity, since they are unlikely to be required for the same mission. The smoking content featured in the original series has been dramatically reduced; no character is seen with cigar or cigarette in hand. In the original series, Lady Penelope was often seen with her cigarette holder, and Jeff Tracy smoked a cigar after the completion of a successful mission. It is likely that this change was made in order to avoid criticism of promoting smoking towards children. Unlike the TV series, the island is actually referred to as Tracy Island in the dialogue, whereas the TV version was called Tracy Island only on Thunderbirds merchandise. Also, in the film, when John calls the island just seconds before Thunderbird 5 is struck by a missile, he calls out \\"Thunderbird 5 to Tracy Island\\". In the series, the Tracy boys would normally radio \\"Base from Thunderbird 1, 2, 5\\" etc. to the island.

First Nations fighters forced the Canadian forces to retreat, with losses on both sides. Background In the spring of 1885, the M√©tis living in the District of Saskatchewan formed a provisional government under Louis Riel, taking control of the area around Batoche. Riel was in contact with First Nations people in Saskatchewan and Alberta, such as the Cree and Assiniboine. The government was concerned that the resistance would spread to First Nations across the North-West Territories. The Government of Canada quickly made preparations to send troops to crush the Resistance. Bands of Cree, assembled under the leadership of Poundmaker, went to Battleford. The purpose of the visit was to lobby the Indian agent there, Mr. Rae, for better supplies (many members of the band were starving) and to discuss the political situation. The people of Battleford and some of the settlers in the surrounding area, hearing reports of large numbers of Cree and Assiniboine leaving reserves and making their way to Battleford, feared for their safety. On the night of March 30, 1885, townspeople began to abandon the town and seek shelter in North-West Mounted Police Fort Battleford. When Poundmaker and his party reached the town, Rae refused to come out of the fort to meet with them. He kept them waiting for two days. Poundmaker's people meanwhile suffered from hunger, having been refused supplies by Rae. The abandoned homes and businesses were looted about this time. The identity of the looters is disputed. Some reports claimed Poundmaker's people were responsible, but one observer alleged that most of the looting had already been done by whites.Robert Jefferson, Fifty Years on the Saskatchewan, 127 Oral history accounts claim that the looting was done by Nakoda people, and that Poundmaker did his best to stop it.Stonechild, Blair. \\"An Indian View of the 1885 Uprising\\" in \\"Sweet Promises: A Reader on Indian-White Relations in Canada\\", J.R. Miller (ed) Either way, Poundmaker's people left the next day. Meanwhile, bands of Assiniboine living south of Battleford had heard about the M√©tis' rebellion. A small group of them killed a local farmer who had treated them harshly, and shot their Indian agent for beating a teenage girl. They then went north to Battleford to meet up with Poundmaker. a number of homes and businesses in Battleford were then looted and burned. There is some controversy as to who was responsible and as to the extent of the destruction. The Canadian government sent Major General Frederick Middleton to Saskatchewan to crush the M√©tis' rebellion. The small police force at Fort Battleford, suddenly responsible for the safety of nearly 500 civilians, called on him for reinforcements and hastily set about forming a home guard to garrison the post. Middleton detached a column under the leadership of Lieutenant Colonel William Otter to relieve Battleford. Otter's column consisted of some 763 men from the 2nd Battalion, \\"Queen's Own Rifles of Canada\\", 'B' Battery, Regiment of Canadian Artillery, 'C' Company of the Infantry School Corps, a party of sharpshooters from the 1st Battalion Governor General's Foot Guards, a small party of North-West Mounted Police under the command of Percy Neale, and assorted teamsters. The column travelled by rail to Swift Current, setting out on the march for Battleford on April 13 and arriving on April 24. When Otter arrived, he found hundreds of civilians, white and M√©tis, crammed into the fort. However, Poundmaker's followers were nowhere to be found. Overjoyed at Otter's arrival, the townspeople and settlers wanted revenge on the Indians for the losses in lives and material that they had suffered. Many of Otter's troops, inexperienced militiamen, were angry that they had \\"missed out on a fight\\". Pressured by the townspeople and his own troops, Otter decided to take action. Despite orders from General Middleton to stay in Battleford, he wired the Lieutenant-Governor of the Northwest Territories (who was also the Indian Commissioner), Edgar Dewdney, for permission to \\"punish Poundmaker.\\"Dewdney Papers, Vol. 5, p. 1806, Otter to Dewdney, April 26, 1885. Permission was granted. A garrison was left in Battleford, while he led a flying column of 392 men to attack the Cree and Assiniboine at Cut Knife Hill. His force was made up of 75 North-West Mounted Police (cavalry), several small units of Canadian army regulars, and various volunteers and militia. He carried with him two 7-pounder field rifles and a Gatling gun. He set out on the afternoon of May 1. His plan was to march until dusk, rest until the moon rose, then continue on to attack the Cree and Assiniboine early in the morning, while they were asleep. Battle of Cut Knife Creek Meanwhile, the Cree were encamped on their reserve west of Battleford, on Cut Knife Creek. They were joined by various other bands, including Assiniboine. They knew that there were thousands of Canadian soldiers in the area to fight the M√©tis' rebellion and decided to protect themselves. As was Cree custom, the war chief Fine Day replaced Poundmaker (the 'political chief') as leader until the fighting was over. The entire encampment was moved across Cut Knife Creek to the west side. Behind the camp was Cut Knife Hill, and on both sides of it were ravines filled with bushes and trees. Altogether, nine bands of Cree and three of Assiniboine were present, numbering some 1500 men, women, and children. Battle Just after dawn on May 2, Otter's column arrived. Otter had expected that the camp would be in the prairie on the east side of Cut Knife Creek. He had not anticipated that he would have to ford the creek. After his column had crossed the creek, they had to wade through a marsh before they reached the encampment. An old Cree man named Jacob with Long Hair had woken up when he heard the sound of the soldiers crossing the creek, and he alerted the camp. Colonel Otter set up two cannons and a Gatling gun and started firing on the camp. In the first few minutes, there was total confusion. The gunfire broke lodges and destroyed the camp. Women and children went running for the safety of the ravines. A group of Assiniboine warriors charged Otter's men to stop them from killing the women and children. The other warriors moved into the ravines, and Fine Day went to the top of Cut Knife Hill to direct the Cree counterattack. The warriors fought in small groups. One group would run forward, attack the soldiers, then rush back to the ravine before the soldiers could get them. As soon as the soldiers tried to attack the warriors on one side, another group of warriors would rush out of the second ravine and attack them from behind. The other warriors guarded the women and children. Otter could not attack, because he had no idea where the enemy were nor of their numbers. Robert Jefferson, an eyewitness reports that \\"not more than 50 [Natives] altogether, had taken part in the battle. This was understandable since few were armed.\\" Douglas Light's research indicates some 243 Cree and Assiniboine men were present, and notes that a number of young boys also took part in the fight.Light, Douglas W. Footprints in the Dust. Turner-Warwick Publications, 1987. Otter formed his men into a wedge. Two lines of soldiers and police faced the two ravines. The volunteers and militia guarded the rear, facing the marsh. As the battle continued, Fine Day employed a flanking maneuver, whereby his warriors began to move along the two ravines, getting closer and closer to the soldiers. The warriors stayed behind trees and bushes while they fired, so that Otter's men could not see anyone to shoot at. Colonel Otter's soldiers were almost encircled: on the left and right were the ravines and behind them, the way out was made difficult by the marsh. After six hours of fighting, Otter decided to withdraw. As the soldiers crossed the marsh, some of Poundmaker's fighters mounted their horses to continue the attack. Poundmaker asked them to let Otter's men leave. They respected Poundmaker and allowed Otter to retreat to Battleford without attack. Some historians believe only Poundmaker's actions prevented an outright slaughter of Otter's troops.Battle of Cut Knife Hill, 2 May 1885, Canadian Military Heritage. Note: The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan , Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan. describes the terrain and initial encounter somewhat differently.

Osgoode, members of the Guards Company of Sharpshooters (Ottawa) *Corporal W. H. T. Lowry, NWMPMacleod (editor). Swords and ploughshares, p. 11 Conclusion The Battle of Cut Knife was the natives' most successful battle during the North-West Rebellion. They had the advantage of being on their own territory, but also several disadvantages: they were outnumbered, attacked by surprise, and short on ammunition. Fourteen of Otter's soldiers were wounded, and eight killed, including one abandoned to be mutilated by native women;Morton, Desmond. The Canadian general: Sir William Otter. Toronto: A.M. Hakkert Ltd., 1974. three natives were wounded and five killed, including a Nez Perce who had come north from the United States some years earlier. The battle instilled in some of Otter's men a respect for their enemy. Otter had expected Poundmaker's people to be caught off-guard and demoralized and to surrender quickly. But that had not happened. However, despite suffering their greatest reverse during the campaign, sheer weight of numbers and better supplies favoured the North-West Field Force. In just a few weeks, the starving Cree went to Battleford to make peace with Major-General Middleton. Fine Day, the Cree war chief who had directed the battle, escaped to the United States. Poundmaker was arrested and jailed for seven months. Lieutenant-Colonel William Otter survived the battle and remained a prominent figure in the military, commanding The Royal Canadian Regiment in the Boer War, and acting as Director of Internment Camps in World War I. Many people have compared this battle to the Battle of the Little Bighorn. There are some major similarities: in both cases, an army officer disobeyed orders; both tried to catch a native camp by surprise; both Custer and Otter badly misjudged the terrain and had to slow down their attacks; and both ended up being surrounded by warriors and had no idea where to charge. Otter, at least, knew when to retreat (and was allowed to do so), while Custer kept fighting and suffered hundreds of casualties. Of course, the battles were very different in their outcome. Whereas Custer himself was killed along with a third of his soldiers, Otter and most of his soldiers survived their battle and emerged with a new respect for native warriors. Legacy The site of the battle was designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 1923. A bronze statue at Cartier Square Drill Hall in Ottawa, Ontario is dedicated to William B. Osgoode and John Rogers, members of the local Guards Company of Sharp- Shooters who were killed during the Battle of Cutknife Hill.Battle of Cutknife Hill monument In the spring of 2008, Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport Minister Christine Tell proclaimed in Duck Lake, that \\"the 125th commemoration, in 2010, of the 1885 Northwest Resistance is an excellent opportunity to tell the story of the prairie M√©tis and First Nations peoples' struggle with Government forces and how it has shaped Canada today.\\" At Cut Knife is the world's largest tomahawk, the Poundmaker Historical Centre and the Big Bear monument. There is also now, correctly located, a cairn erected by the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada upon Cut Knife Hill overlooking the Poundmaker Battle site and Battle River valley. A government announcement in early May 2019 stated that the Chief Poundmaker, who had been convicted of treason-felony, would be exonerated by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and that a formal apology would be made on 23 May 2019.

He became President of Mexico in 1855 after the outbreak of the Revolution of Ayutla that overthrew Santa Anna. Early life He was born in 1812 to French parents in Puebla de los √Ångeles, in the state of Puebla, New Spain (colonial M√©xico). He participated in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Presidential term Comonfort was president of Mexico from 11 December 1855 to 21 January 1858. During his term as president, Benito Ju√°rez served as president of the Supreme Court of Mexico. Constitution of 1857 He was a moderate liberal who tried to maintain an uncertain coalition, but the moderate liberals and the radical liberals were unable to resolve their sharp differences. During his presidency, the Constitution of 1857 was drafted creating the Second Federal Republic of Mexico. The new constitution restricted some of the Catholic Church's traditional privileges regarding land holdings, revenues and control over education. It granted religious freedom, and only stated that the Catholic Church was the favored faith. The anti-clerical radicals scored a major victory with the ratification of the constitution, because it weakened the Church and enfranchised all citizens. War of the Reform The constitution was unacceptable to the clergy and the conservatives, and they plotted a revolt. The country descended into the Reform War, a civil war launched by reactionaries against the Constitution of 1857 which, among other things, had abolished privileges for the Catholic Church. Shortly after the adoption of the Constitution of 1857, a board of generals staged a coup d'√©tat, proclaiming the Plan of Tacubaya, which decreed the nullification of the Constitution. President Comonfort, representing himself as a moderate, wavered but decided to go along with the generals. In exchange, the Catholic Church repealed the March 1857 excommunication decree for those who adhered to the new plan. On 17 December 1857, anti-constitutional forces led by General F√©lix Zuloaga took control of the capital without firing a shot. But defenders of the 1857 Constitution did not stay calm for long. President Comonfort then decreed himself extraordinary powers, an action which alienated both the reactionary rebels as well as the constitutionalists. As unrest grew, many opponents were imprisoned or shot. Even Benito Ju√°rez was put behind bars for several days. Resignation and return to Mexico On 11 January 1858, General Zuloaga demanded the ouster of the President. Comonfort resigned, and according to the Constitution of 1857, Benito Ju√°rez, President of the Supreme Court, assumed the presidency. In opposition, the board of generals and Catholic clergy selected General Zuloaga as their president. After seeking asylum in the United States, Comonfort returned to act again as a general against the French invasion in 1862. He died the next year, on 13 November 1863, after being attacked by a group of bandits near Celaya, Guanajuato.Brian Hamnett, Ju√°rez, New York: Longman 1994, 270.

Players control Vyse, a young air pirate, and his friends as they attempt to stop the Valuan Empire from reviving ancient weapons with the potential to destroy the world. Skies of Arcadia uses traditional Japanese role-playing game systems such as turn-based battles and experience points, but puts greater focus on exploration, with the player flying an airship in 3D space. The development team included staff who had contributed to Panzer Dragoon, Phantasy Star, Sonic the Hedgehog and Sakura Wars games. Skies of Arcadia was one of the best-reviewed Dreamcast games, but underperformed commercially. After Sega's exit from the hardware industry, it was ported to the GameCube as Skies of Arcadia Legends in 2002. Gameplay Skies of Arcadia is a role-playing video game (RPG) with an emphasis on world exploration. Gameplay is similar to early 3D Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest games; the player engages enemies in turn-based battles to earn experience points, making their characters stronger. The overworld is divided into six regions, traversed by flying airships in 3D space; \\"Discoveries\\", hidden locations, reward the player with extra benefits. The world map starts out blank, and it is up to the player to chart the map through exploration. The player may also recruit characters they encounter in exploration, allowing them to be placed on the ship or base's staff, adding extra benefits to exploration or battle. When docked on landmasses or warships, exploration occurs on foot. There, gameplay alternates between exploring cities and progressing through the game's dungeons. Cities are visited to buy equipment to make character's stronger, and interact with non- playable characters to progress the story. The dungeons exist in the format of a maze, with the player navigating the characters through it to obtain beneficial items in treasure chests while taking on enemies in random battles. Getting through the end of the maze generally culminates in a last boss battle to be won prior to exiting. The battle system involves managing \\"Spirit Points,\\" \\"Magic Points,\\" and a multi-colored \\"Moon Stone\\" system. Plot=Setting The game takes place in the fictional skies referred to as Arcadia, where six civilizations coexist on floating continents orbited by six moons of different colors. Thousands of years prior to the present time of the game, the civilizations, one of which existed for each moon, developed technologically to the point where each created a Gigas, a colossal living weapon of mass destruction, controlled by a Moon Crystal. Using the Gigas, the civilizations warred with one another, threatening the extinction of humanity. The most advanced, the Silver Civilization, used their Gigas to summon the Rains of Destruction, which pulled meteors from the orbiting moons and crashed them down onto the planet's surface. The catastrophic destruction stopped the rampage of the Gigas, as well as nearly destroyed the other five civilizations, thus ending the war. A seal was placed on the Silver Gigas to prevent it from being used again, and the Moon Crystals were hidden away, while each civilization worked on rebuilding itself. = Characters = The player primarily controls Vyse, along with a party of up to four characters. The other two main characters, Aika and Fina, are mandatory characters for the party through most of the game. The final spot in the group is filled by one of three other playable characters - Drachma, Gilder, and Enrique - dictated either by story events, or the player's choice. An additional twenty two minor characters are recruit-able to fill various roles on Vyse's airship, though they remain there, and do not follow Vyse's party. *Vyse: A 17-year-old member of the Blue Rogue air pirates that resist the Valuan Empire. Vyse has an upbeat, optimistic and determined personality, making him a natural leader. Vyse fights with twin cutlasses. *Aika: Vyse's close friend since childhood and fellow 17-year-old Blue Rogue. Aika has a strong and energetic personality and is deeply loyal to those around her, but has a bit of a fiery temper and an obsession for obtaining treasure. She was orphaned at an early age, and was cared for by Vyse's family. Aika fights using an oversized boomerang. *Fina: A 17-year-old \\"Silvite\\", one of the few survivors of the ancient, defunct Silver Civilization. Fina is beautiful, sweet-natured and demure, yet has an iron will. She is initially naive of the Arcadian way of life, but proves to be a quick learner. She forms a strong bond with Vyse, and a sisterly bond with Aika. Fina's pet, a silver ball-like creature named Cupil, fights for her. *Drachma: A 55-year-old man who lost his right arm, right eye, and only son while fighting the giant arc-whale Rhaknam. His obsession with hunting Rhaknam for revenge leads him to search the skies on his small fishing airship, Little Jack. He pretends not to care about Vyse's group, but he shows up to save them multiple times. He use a mechanical right arm as a weapon during battle. *Gilder: A handsome 32-year-old man, he is the captain of the light, swift pirate vessel Claudia. He is a laid-back, adventurous, and flirtatious individual, and dreads nothing more than being tied down by marriage, constantly fending off advances from Clara, a Blue Rogue obsessed with him. Despite this, Gilder is a highly experienced and capable air pirate. He uses pistols as his weapons and commands a parrot named Willy, who helps in getting him out of tough situations. *Enrique: At 25 years old, Enrique is the crown prince of the Valuan Empire but disagrees strongly with the imperialist policies of his mother, Empress Teodora. Unable to change or even influence the totalitarian ways of the empire, he joins the air pirates later on and even gives Vyse his flagship, the Delphinus. His frank nobility and chivalry are in direct opposition to the attitudes of most of the higher Valuans. Enrique uses rapiers in battle. Story Vyse and Aika are members of the Blue Rogues, a faction of Robin Hood-minded air pirates gathered together to resist the militant and tyrannical Valuan Empire. Led by Empress Teodora, the empire seeks the Moon Crystals to reawaken the Gigas and take over the world. Teodora directs the Valuan Armada, a fleet of warships led by admirals Galcian and Ramirez, to find them. Upon the Silver Civilization learning of this plan, they send Fina to find the Moon Crystals first. She is captured by the Armada, but saved by Vyse and Aika, who, with mutual enemies, agree to help her mission. Hitching a ride with an old fisherman, Drachma, and his ship, the trio recover the Red Moon Crystal from a temple in the desert nation of Nasr and the Green Moon Crystal high above Ixa'taka, a continent of lush forests, while foiling Valuan operations. When Drachma's ship is damaged in a Valuan attack, Vyse is stranded on the small Crescent Island, where he uncovers letters and a map left behind by another pirate seeking treasure. Vyse is found by a fellow Blue Rogue, Gilder, who takes him aboard to search for his friends. Aika and Fina end up in the care of another Blue Rogue, Clara, who takes them to Nasr to help search for Vyse. Aika and Fina find out about the same treasure Vyse learned of, and the three reunite, but are captured by Ramirez and brought to the Valuans' prison fortress. By enlisting the Valuan prince Enrique, who has lost patience with his government's tyranny, and stealing a powerful Valuan warship, the Delphinus, the Blue Rogues escape. Vyse brings everyone back to Crescent Island, where he establishes a base of operations for his crew. The party recovers the Blue Moon Crystal from the eastern Oriental land of Yafutoma and the Purple Moon Crystal from the southern glacial content of Glacia. After obtaining the Yellow Moon Crystal from the Valuan continent, they retrieve Fina's captured ship, which she needs to bring the Moon Crystals to the Silver Civilization in an immense shrine that orbits Arcadia. Ramirez's fleet assaults the Blue Rogues and he steals their Moon Crystals. Vyse, Aika, Fina, and Gilder travel to the Great Silver Shrine in orbit to confer with the elders; they are followed by Galcian and Ramirez, who assassinate the leader of the Silvite elders and from his body extract the final Moon Crystal. Galcian and Ramirez use the Moon Crystals to raise the lost Silver continent of Soltis and break the seal on the Silver Gigas. They use the Rains of Destruction to annihilate the Valuan capital, killing Empress Teodora and seizing control of the Valuan Armada in a bid to dominate the world. Vyse rallies a fleet of Blue Rogues, Yafutoman warships, and ships from other regions of the world to battle the Valuan Armada. The Delphinus crew disables the Hydra, Galcian's capital ship, and boards the ship and defeat Galcian, with assistance from Galcian's subordinate Belleza, who turns on him and kills them both. Ramirez, who has retreated into Soltis, is enraged at Galcian's death, and prepares to use the Rains of Destruction to wipe out the Blue Rogues. He is stopped by the Silvites, who sacrifice their lives to take down the protective shield around Soltis. The party enters Soltis and battle Ramirez, who merges with the Silver Gigas, Zelos, allowing it to awaken. Returning to the Delphinus, Vyse and his crew do battle with Zelos and manage to defeat it. The party rushes to the outer deck, where a chunk of Zelos, merged with Ramirez and controlling him, slams onto the Delphinus's deck. They battle, resulting in Ramirez's death and the defeat of the Valuan Armada. Enrique, the prince of Valua, marries a princess of Yafutoma and becomes emperor of Valua. With a promise of benevolent rule, he and his wife oversee the reconstruction of the Valuan capital. Vyse and Aika inaugurate Fina as a Blue Rogue, and the three sail into the sunset. Development Development began in 1999 under the code name Project Ares. The title was changed to Eternal Arcadia in 2000, retained for the Japanese release. The internal Sega development team, Overworks, consisted of development staff from Team Andromeda and from the Phantasy Star development teams. Producer Rieko Kodama had worked on Phantasy Star 1, 2, and 4, and the first two Sonic the Hedgehog games for the Sega Genesis, while scenario writer Shuntaro Tanaka had written the stories for the first two Sakura Wars RPGs. The soundtrack was composed by Yutaka Minobe and Tatsuyuki Maeda; Maeda had composed music for Sonic 3 & Knuckles. Expectations were high, as Team Andromeda's prior game, Panzer Dragoon Saga (1998), had received critical acclaim, and the Dreamcast had few well-reviewed JRPGs. Development went smoothly, attributed to the increased power and easier architecture of the Dreamcast in comparison to the Sega Saturn. The team was made up of a staff of around 20 people. The team made conscious decisions to make entering individual buildings in towns seamless, without loading, and to use an expressive, anime art style to more clearly show facial expressions and emotions of characters, both of which they felt had been lacking from recent popular RPGs such as Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII. Similarly, while the aforementioned games were focused on dark themes and complicated gameplay systems, Overworks strove to keep the game bright and cheerful, with simple gameplay mechanics that focused on exploring a large game world. The game was released across two of Sega's proprietary GD-ROM discs, to accommodate its size. Development began for the Sega Saturn, with battles on land and the tops of trains. After production moved to the Dreamcast, the motif of traveling the skies was set, inspired by the Age of Discovery. At the time, Japanese role-playing video games portrayed mostly darker worlds, but Overworks was more interested in creating an optimistic protagonist who explored the world. They took care to portray Aika and Fina, Vyse's female friends, on equal footing with him, rather than being saved by him. The historical architecture and ancient civilizations are attributed to team member Shuntaro Tanaka, who majored in history at university and conceptualized the world and scenario, inspiring the \\"discovery\\" aspect. The Japanese Dreamcast release date was set for September 14, 2000, but delayed to October 5, 2000 so the team could create a paid \\"trial version\\" for concurrent release. The release was promoted in Japan with posters and television commercials. During launch month, and spanning eight months total, the game also received an official manga in every issue of Magazine Z, supervised by the development team. A soundtrack was released on CD on the day of the game's released. Localization Eternal Arcadia was renamed Skies of Arcadia for its English-language release, which Sega felt better expressed the premise and story to Western audiences. It was localized by Chris Lucich and Klayton Vorlick. The two were given the freedom to change the game content for Western audiences, though Sega of Japan held the right to veto their changes. While the game still follows the same general plotline from the Japanese game, much of the dialogue was entirely rewritten. The two did a rough translation of the entire game from Japanese to English, and then completely deleted the Japanese from their records, choosing to write the subsequent and final drafts without referencing the original text. Vorlick completely rewrote the dialogue for Enrique, Vigoro, and Fina, while Lucich rewrote Gilder and Aika, and the two co-wrote for Vyse. Speech patterns expected to be annoying to Western audiences, such as the repetitive nature of Fina saying , were removed, while more interesting speech patterns, quirks, and jokes, were given many of the rest of the characters. The two were influenced by the work of Joss Whedon, adding many dry, sarcastic responses to the dialogue that had been more straightforward exchanges in the original Japanese script. Many side characters and weapons were renamed after members of the localization and quality assurance team. Some more mature content was edited; the two scaled back on references to Aika being assaulted by Vigaro when captured by him, and of references to Ramirez obsessively talking about Galcian in later scenes of the game. All traces of cigarettes are removed, shops serve Loqua juice instead of alcohol, and the female character Bellena's attire is altered to be less revealing. The localization was completed in four months, with 80 to 100 hour work weeks, on a script of over 2,000 pages. Skies of Arcadia was released in English in North America on November 13, 2000, and in Europe on April 21, 2001. Skies of Arcadia Legends port In October 2001, shortly after Sega's announcement that it would abandon the Dreamcast to make software for other consoles, Sega announced that it would port Skies of Arcadia to GameCube and PlayStation 2. US developer Point of View Software was brought on to help with the conversion, though the original staff from Overworks continued to work on the game. Development was announced to begin in January 2002, with Sega initially aiming for a mid-2002 release. However, by April, Sega announced that the PS2 version would be delayed, and by May, rumors spread that it had been cancelled, though this was refuted by Sega. In August 2002, Sega announced that the PS2 version was cancelled in favor of focusing on the GameCube release, which was, as of October 2002, 80% complete. Skies of Arcadia Legends was released on the GameCube in Japan on December 26, 2002, in North America on January 27, 2003, and in Europe on May 23, 2003. A port for Windows was announced in early 2004, but never released. Sega described Legends as a \\"director's cut\\". It partially uses the original game's code, and partially uses newly written code for the GameCube. It features improvements such as slightly more detailed character models, a more stable frame rate, reduced loading times, new sidequests and subplots, new hidden discoveries, and a \\"Wanted List\\" of new enemies to find. It also has fewer random encounters, and awards more experience points in battle to compensate. With the GameCube lacking the Dreamcast's VMU, some effects, such as Cupils notifications, were moved to the television screen, while the \\"Pinta Quest\\" minigame was removed outright. With the GameCube being less readily connected to the internet, the downloadable content was implemented into the main game. Reception The original Dreamcast release received critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the game has an average score of 93 out of 100, which indicates \\"universal acclaim\\" based on 21 reviews. GameRankings, pulling from a higher percentage of reviews, tracked it slightly lower, at 90% out of 40 reviews. IGN praised it for being \\"One of the most solid games visually on the Dreamcast\\" and concluded that \\"There's so much to explore, so much character, and a great story that you don't mind being retold again\\". GameSpot gave the game a 9.2 as well, praising the visuals, stating that they were \\"some of the most painstakingly detailed ever seen in a role-playing game\\". As a whole, GameSpot concluded that the game \\"lives up [to] the high expectations\\". Game Informer listed it as one of the top 10 Dreamcast games. Despite the generally positive reviews, many critics did criticize that it was sometimes difficult to explore the game's world due to the game's high rate of random encounter- based battles frequently disrupting progress. Despite this, in a 2017 retrospective from Metacritic on the highest rated exclusive games (at time of release) per platform, Skies of Arcadia placed third for the Dreamcast, behind Soul Caliber and Jet Grind Radio. In the May 2017 issue of Game Informer magazine, they listed Skies of Arcadia as the 55th best RPG of all time. Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the Dreamcast version of the game for Next Generation and stated that \\"Despite the problems ‚Äì which it shares with practically every other Japanese RPG ‚Äì Skies of Arcadia is an impressive, thoroughly delightful game that no one should pass up.\\" The GameCube release, Skies of Arcadia Legends, received slightly less positive reviews. The aggregate scores were still generally positive, with Metacritic giving it an average of 85 out of 100, out of 31 critics, and GameRankings giving it an 85%, out of 56 reviews. A common source of the lower scores were the game's graphics, with criticism coming from the fact that they had not been substantially improved despite more powerful hardware and over two years passing from the Dreamcast's release. Expectations in graphics had changed drastically in between releases - while the Dreamcast release was frequently compared to the weaker original PlayStation and Final Fantasy VII, VIII, and IX, by the time of the GameCube release, the game was compared against the likes of the much more powerful PlayStation 2 and its games like Final Fantasy X and Xenosaga. Despite the positive critical reception, neither version of Skies of Arcadia sold well. Legacy=Canceled entries In addition to the cancelled PlayStation 2 and PC releases of the game, a sequel to the game was considered by Sega in the early 2000s, but did not begin full production. The development team had shown interest in creating a sequel, or a portable iteration for the Game Boy Advance during the development of Legends for the GameCube, but neither materialized. In September 2002, after the completion of Legends, Skies of Arcadia producer Rieko Kodama stated that the team was still interested in creating a sequel, but that work had still not started on it, though had it started, she felt that the GameCube would have been the most likely platform for its release.Interview with Rieko Kodama , Sept 2002, Archived In February 2003, Overworks president Noriyoshi Ohba announced that a Skies of Arcadia sequel had entered the planning stages. However, in a December 2004 interview, Kodama stated that while there had been plans for a sequel, the project was put on hold indefinitely while many members of the team were pulled into working on Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love.MAN!AC Magazine (German), December 2004 issue, Rieko Kodama Interview, Cybermedia Starting in 2010, Sega began a campaign of releasing HD remasters of Dreamcast games digitally on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, including games such as Sonic Adventure, Crazy Taxi, Sonic Adventure 2, and Jet Set Radio. In 2012, Sega brand manager Ben Harborne stated that a Skies of Arcadia HD was a likely next release, after Shenmue, as they were the most frequently requested titles for re-release. Sega renewed the Skies of Arcadia trademark later in the same year, though a re-release did not materialize. As recently as 2020, main developer staff Kenji Hiruta expressed interest in returning to the series as well. In other media Skies of Arcadia characters have appeared in Sega properties. Multiple characters from the game later appeared in Sega's 2008 video game Valkyria Chronicles, another title directed by Shuntaro Tanaka. \\"Vyse Inglebard\\" and \\"Aika Thompson\\" appear as optional members of Squad 7 and are listed on each other's \\"Like\\" list. Fina also appears as one of several identical sisters who serve as the squad's unplayable medics. The three also appeared in the Japan-only Valkyria Chronicles 3 in 2011 as well. Vyse and Fina made minor cameos in some of the accompanying Valkyria Chronicles anime as well. Outside of the Valkyria games, Vyse has also made some appearances in some Sonic the Hedgehog related media. He is a playable character in 2012 Sega racing game Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed, which also features a racetrack based on Skies of Arcadia, where the participants must drive and fly through the Blue Rogue's home-base while eluding attacks from the Valuan Empire. Vyse also appears in the Sonic the Hedgehog comic book adaption of Transformed featured in Sonic Universe #45, and again in the Sonic comics for the \\"World Unite\\" Sega character crossover story arc.

Livingstone supported incumbent Lutfur Rahman in 2010, but shifted his support to Biggs after an investigation into allegations of \\"mismanagement and fraud\\" by the current mayor's team at the council. However, Livingstone also remained supportive of Rahman. Biggs came second in the election to Rahman, but the election was subsequently over-turned by an election court. 2015 On 11 June 2015 Biggs was elected mayor of Tower Hamlets after Rahman was found by the court to have broken election law and was stripped of office. Biggs beat independent Rabina Khan, who was endorsed by the disqualified Rahman.

Background and personal life Born in Chicago to Korean parents, Myung grew up near John Petrucci on Long Island. After taking violin lessons from the age of five, he started playing bass guitar at fifteen. After graduating from high school, he and Petrucci enrolled at the Berklee College of Music, where they met Mike Portnoy. The trio became the nucleus of Dream Theater, which became Myung's primary professional focus. Style Myung mainly uses a two or three finger picking style in his playing. He sometimes uses slapping and popping on some songs, such as \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\", and also uses tapping and harmonics in his bass playing. Myung's use of harmonics is frequently accompanied by a chorus effect, as in the opening of \\"Lifting Shadows off a Dream\\". The songs \\"These Walls\\" and \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" feature Myung using a pick. Myung uses both tapping and fingerstyle to play the Chapman Stick. Myung's favorite bands include the Beatles, Black Sabbath, the Who, Iron Maiden, Rush, Yes, Jethro Tull and Genesis. He cites bassists Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, Chris Squire, Steve Harris, Geddy Lee and Jaco Pastorius as main influences on his playing style. Myung is known for his rigorous practicing schedule; producer Kevin Shirley and keyboardist Derek Sherinian have said that Myung is the only musician they know who \\"warms down\\" after a show.(on the Metropolis 2000: Scenes From New York DVD) Petrucci has said that when he and Myung were at Berklee, they had an agreement to practice at least six hours every day. Dream Theater's group writing process makes it difficult to identify which member of the band authored a particular song or song section, but on DVD commentaries, the band members have sometimes identified certain parts as \\"a John Myung riff,\\" such as parts of Fatal Tragedy and the introduction to The Glass Prison. Myung wrote the lyrics to one song per album from Images and Words to Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory, but thereafter did not contribute any lyrics until A Dramatic Turn of Events. Portnoy has claimed that this was because Myung's lyrics usually needed some work by the rest of the band to fit the song. As a result, the band eventually imposed an unwritten lyric rule that required lyrics to be \\"properly formed, phrased, constructed, etc. to go with the melodies,\\" and, \\"since then, John has kind of backed off.\\" Myung at Mitsubishi Electric Hall D√ºsseldorf in 2014. Instruments=Early Dream Theater gear For When Dream and Day Unite, Dream Theater's debut, Myung played a modified Music Man StingRay four-string bass and a Fender Jazz Bass. The StingRay (his main live instrument in that period) was customized with an added front pickup driving a clean bass amp, while the bridge signal was sent to the effects chain. A four-string Spector NS-2NS-2 was used for tracking 1992's Images and Words. Switch to six- string basses Myung switched to six-string basses for Dream Theater's subsequent tours, using several high-end Tobias \\"Basic\\" models. These can be seen in videos from Images and Words and heard on Live at the Marquee. He has primarily used six-string basses ever since. For the Awake album and tours, Myung used basses produced by a small company formed by former Tobias luthier Nicholas Tung. Myung owned at least three of the only 100 instruments constructed, two \\"Wingbass II Bolt-on\\" six-strings (one Natural and one Sunburst), and one \\"Wingbass II Hybrid (a \\"half neck-through\\"). The natural- finish Wingbass II was his main live instrument in this period, and all three appear in his \\"Progressive Bass Concepts\\" instructional video. Switch to Yamaha After Tung ceased production, Myung began endorsing Yamaha instruments, using its TRB and John Patitucci six-string fretted and fretless basses live while working with Yamaha's Artist Custom Shop on what would become his signature instrument. Prototypes of the RBX6JM along with his TRB basses were used for the recording of 1997's Falling into Infinity. A bolt-on bass with alder body with flame-maple top, 35\\" scale, and \\"Infinity\\" dot inlay on the fretboard, various Red and Blue RBX6JM models were thereafter his main studio and live instruments until 2002, although he experimented with a Hamer 8-string bass and Music Man StingRay five-string while recording Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. In 2002, Myung and Yamaha unveiled the RBX-JM2, an updated version of his signature bass that echoed the redesign of Yamaha's entire RBX-series of basses. A 34\\" scale was used instead of the 35\\" scale used on the RBX6JM had, and a single Seymour Duncan Music Man-type humbucking pickup was used, influenced by Myung's use of the StingRay on Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. (Myung's personal RBX-JM2 differed from the production model, having a second pickup and additional controls.) This instrument was used on Dream Theater's Train of Thought and Octavarium albums and tours. Switch to Music Man John Myung in 2012. Footage from the recording of Systematic Chaos in 2006 showed Myung playing various Music Man basses. Early in the 2007 \\"Chaos in Motion Tour\\", he was seen playing a MusicMan Bongo 5 HS in an signature \\"Inca Silver\\" (flat gray) finish on stage, the first time since before Images and Words that Myung had toured with a five-string. On July 23, 2007, Sterling Ball announced that Myung was moving to Music Man, writing that \\"John has fallen in love with the prototypes that we made of the Bongo 6 and is now playing them exclusively.\\" Ball added that the Bongo 6 \\"is not a signature bass\\", but \\"part of the regular line.\\" In an interview with MusicRadar in 2010, Myung stated that he was working with Music Man on a modified Bongo. The finished product was a bass with a 6-string body but with the 6 strings accommodating a 5-string neck, resulting in a tighter string spacing. In a later interview, he said that this will not be considered a signature model, per Music Man's company policy.. Other instruments Myung has used a 12 string Grand Chapman Stick on two songs on Falling Into Infinity, \\"Take Away My Pain\\" and most prominently \\"New Millennium\\", which he performs live on Stick. Dream Theater sources report that the Stick routinely comes into the studio and has sometimes made it so far as tracking (the song \\"Home\\" from Scenes from a Memory originally featured it), but it has not made the mix since Falling into Infinity. He did, however, use the Stick on several tracks on Sean Malone's second album Gordian Knot including \\"Srikara Tal\\" and \\"Redemption's Way.\\" Myung used a fretless bass on the Dream Theater songs \\"Through Her Eyes\\", \\"Far From Heaven\\", \\"Hollow Years\\", \\"Peruvian Skies\\", \\"Hell's Kitchen\\" and \\"The Silent Man\\". He has also used Moog Taurus 3 Bass Pedals since 2011.

He usually appears in books featuring the Green Lantern Corps, an intergalactic police force in which Gardner has usually been depicted as a member. Gardner's original design was based on actor Martin Milner. Publication history Guy Gardner was created by John Broome and Gil Kane in Green Lantern #59 (March 1968), although the character was changed significantly in the 1980s by Steve Englehart and Joe Staton who turned him into a jingoistic parody of an ultra- macho \\"red-blooded American male\\". This latter remains the character's archetype to this date. Englehart recounted: Staton's design for Guy Gardner was based on the character Major Ronald Merrick from the TV series The Jewel in the Crown, as Staton saw Merrick's entitlement and resentment as a parallel to Guy Gardner. Gardner's later blue costume, introduced in the first issue of the character's first ongoing series (cover dated October 1992), was also designed by Staton. During this series, retitled Guy Gardner: Warrior with issue #17, Guy Gardner is gradually evolved into a more vulnerable and heroic character; Beau Smith, who wrote the series for most of its run, was concerned that leaving him as an angry jerk would make the character stagnant and one- note. Fictional character biography=Early life Guy was raised in Baltimore by his parents, Roland and Peggy Gardner. His father, Roland, was an abusive alcoholic who beat Guy every day. Some of Guy's injuries were visible such as bruises, cuts and bumps but others were invisible and were emotionally inflicted. Guy worked hard in school to try to win his father's approval, but Roland instead lavished attention and compliments upon Guy's older brother, Mace. Guy's only escape at this time was General Glory comic books, going so far as to model his bowl haircut on Glory's sidekick, Ernie.Guy Gardner #11 (August 1993) During his mid-teens, Guy became a juvenile delinquent. He constantly defied authority. Later, he was straightened out by his older brother, Mace, now a police officer, and he eventually went to college, supporting himself, and earning bachelor's degrees in education and psychology from the University of Michigan, where he also played football until a career- ending injury. The injury deeply affected Guy. After college, Guy worked as a social welfare caseworker, dealing with prison inmates and their rehabilitation. He abandoned this line of work, however, fearing it brought out his aggressive nature. Moving on, he became a teacher for children with disabilities. This job brought out the loving and caring side of himself.Guy Gardner #14 (November 1993) In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Guy is now an ex-police officer and middle child of a family with a long tradition of membership in the Baltimore Police Department going back to 1860. He is the second human to earn a Green Lantern ring, after coming to the rescue of his older brother Gerard who had become pinned down during a police shootout with a street gang. In this version Guy has a strained relationship with his father Ebenezer Gardner, a decorated cop forced into disability after taking a bullet in the line of duty, for issues related to the unexplained incident which kicked Guy off the police force.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3 #0 (September 2012) This was retconned in DC Rebirth which returned to his original origin of Guy being abused by his alcoholic father as a kid, which was seen during Guys fight with the Sinestro Corps member Arkillo in the present,Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #16 and later his father being reintroduced under his original name Roland Gardner.Hal Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps #46 Green Lantern Corps Guy Gardner's first appearance in Green Lantern #59 (March, 1968). The appointed Green Lantern of Space Sector 2814, an alien named Abin Sur from the planet Ungara, crash-landed on Earth after being mortally wounded. As Sur died, his power ring sought and found two potential successors: Guy Gardner and Hal Jordan. Jordan was nearer to the crash, so he was chosen over Gardner.Green Lantern vol. 2 #59 (March 1968) In the same story, the Guardian supercomputers predicted Guy would have perished early in his career if he had been chosen first. In the later Booster Gold series it was shown that a time traveling Booster convinced Gardner to visit his dying father, thus ensuring that Jordan would be the candidate in closest proximity. Gardner was relegated to backup status should anything happen to Jordan.Booster Gold vol. 2 #2 (November 2007) When Jordan became aware of Gardner's status as his backup, he went out of his way to set up a chance meeting, and the two became friends. Though Gardner was originally naive to Jordan's secret identity, he eventually assisted Jordan during his adventures. He is later partnered with Jordan after completing his training under Kilowog. During an earthquake, Gardner was hit by a bus while attempting to rescue one of his students. During his recovery, the Guardians recruited John Stewart to be Jordan's new \\"backup\\".Green Lantern vol. 2 #87 (December 1971) Some time later, during a period where Gardner was performing his duties as a backup Green Lantern, Hal Jordan's power battery, the source of the ring's energy, exploded in Gardner's face due to damage done to it by the Crumbler and trapped him in the Phantom Zone.Green Lantern vol. 2 #116 (May 1979) Jordan and Kari Limbo, Gardner's girlfriend at the time, both believed him to be dead, and the two developed a romantic relationship that ultimately culminated in a marriage proposal.Green Lantern vol. 2 #121 (October 1979) Gardner was able to interrupt the wedding by contacting Limbo telepathically.Green Lantern vol. 2 #122 (November 1979) By then, however, Gardner's bus accident, the power battery explosion, his assimilation into the zone, and the subsequent torture at the hands of General Zod and other residents of the Phantom Zone had affected his mind. When Gardner was released from the Phantom Zone, he was diagnosed with brain damage and was comatose for a number of years.Green Lantern vol. 2 #123 (December 1979) During the Crisis on Infinite Earths, the Guardians of the Universe split into two factions over how to confront the Crisis. A minority faction of six Guardians emulated their former brethren, the Controllers, by recruiting a Green Lantern to directly attack and destroy the forces of the antimatter universe. For reasons unknown, Gardner was revived by the renegade Guardians, given a power ring not tied to the Central Power Battery on Oa, sporting a uniform similar to that worn by the Fists of the Guardians, and given a mission. He was to recruit and command the deadliest and most powerful criminals in the universe, including the Shark, Hector Hammond (left behind after trying to attack Gardner), Sonar, Throttle, Blindside, and Goldface, to launch a strike against the home base of the Anti-Monitor.Green Lantern #197 (February 1986) Gardner's brain damage manifested itself in the form of an arrogant, violent, unstable, and often childish new personality. Gardner believed himself to be the last \\"true\\" Green Lantern, superior to all the others, particularly Jordan. Five of the renegade Guardians were slain by a wave of antimatter, and the sixth eventually reconciled with the rest of the Guardians. In the meantime, Gardner succeeded in his task of recruiting powerful villains. Both Hal Jordan and John Stewart prevented Gardner from completing his mission, which would have ultimately destroyed the universe. Following the Crisis, the Guardians, along with the Zamarons, left the universe to create the next generation of Guardians. Gardner was placed under the care of the remaining Guardian-turned-mortal Appa Ali Apsa (who later went on to become the \\"Mad Guardian\\") on the planet Maltus in order to teach Gardner the ways of the Corps, a situation which Gardner resented. Gardner eventually escaped and returned to Earth, but was recaptured by Appa Ali Apsa (with the assistance of two Corps honor guards) intending to reclaim Gardner's power ring. At the request of Kari Limbo, Hal Jordan pleaded on Gardner's behalf for his freedom, which was granted with no return of gratitude from Gardner. As a consequence of the Corps executing Sinestro, the majority of the Corps lost their power rings; Gardner was one of the few remaining active Green Lanterns. After the defeat and death of the \\"Mad Guardian\\", the Guardians returned and assigned Gardner to be the official Green Lantern of Sector 2814 while Jordan was assigned to recruit new Corps members. Justice League International Soon after obtaining his freedom from Maltus, Gardner became a founding member of the Justice League International after the original JLA disbanded during the 1986-87 storyline \\"Legends\\". In his time with the JLI, Gardner resented Batman's leadership of the group, going so far as to challenge the Dark Knight to a fist fight; Batman downed Guy with one punch after Guy took off his ring. The other members left him lying on the floor. When Guy woke up, he banged his head on a console and knocked himself out. When he comes to, his personality has changed to kind and gentle.Justice League #5 (September 1987). DC Comics. Until he hit his head again at a later point, Guy was kind, sweet, boyishly innocent, and a perfect gentleman to the female members of the group. Guy's run in JLI was full of constant personality shifts and endless arguing between team members. This led to a fight with Lobo,Justice League International #18Justice League International #19 (October 1988) the sucker-punching of Blue Beetle during a boxing match,Justice League America #52 (July 1991). DC Comics. and finally him quitting the team after being \\"belittled\\" by Superman.Justice League America #63 (June 1992). DC Comics. Gardner was romantically involved with his fellow Leaguer Ice, even learning some rudimentary Norwegian, but he is often callous to her and slow to admit his feelings. Their relationship ended with her death at the hands of the Overmaster. Guy Gardner: Reborn Guy Gardner with his yellow power ring After completing his assignment of recruiting new Corps members, Jordan returned to Earth to reclaim his title as Green Lantern of Sector 2814. Gardner's response was to challenge Jordan to a fight where the loser would quit the Corps. Gardner lost and surrendered his ring. After some failed run-ins with Goldface and Black Hand as a non-powered vigilante, he set out on a quest to regain his power and identity. Tricking Lobo into assisting him, he invaded Qward to find the yellow power ring of Sinestro, but was told by the Qwardians that the ring was unique and never returned to Qward. He then travelled to Oa where he found it on Sinestro's hand in Oa's \\"Crypt of the Green Lantern Corps\\".Guy Gardner Reborn #1Guy Gardner Reborn #3 (1992) Gardner's own comic series began with him using the yellow ring and a modified costume similar to his Green Lantern costume but from street clothes. The yellow ring did not use a battery to recharge, instead needing to be used against the power rings of Green Lanterns so it could absorb their residual energy to restore its power, which Gardner discovered by accident when Kilowog fought him while his ring was powerless. Guy Gardner returned to Earth to pick a fight with Superman but eventually rejoined the Justice League and helped battle the monster Doomsday, in which he and his teammates were brutally beaten and Superman was killed during the creature's defeat. During the Reign of the Supermen storyline when four different versions of Superman appeared after his death, Guy fought, became allies with and later endorsed the Last Son of Krypton Superman, who was actually the Eradicator. Later, Guy cleared his name of murder that was committed by his Draalian clone \\"Joe Gardner\\" and learned that his brother Mace had become the assassin Militia; after a brawl between the two, Guy decided to take the codename Warrior. In the JLA: Classified-based miniseries I Can't Believe It's Not the Justice League, Guy assisted the Super Buddies and was revealed to have kept his yellow ring. Guy Gardner: Warrior By this time, the power of Guy's ring had begun to fluctuate due to the meddling of the villain Parallax (Hal Jordan). Deprived of his powers, Guy wore a golden exosuit provided by Blue Beetle which simulated superhuman strength. Guy was not happy with this initial suit as it did not feel as natural as using a ring power. The exosuit first appeared in issue 18, the second issue to feature the new title of Guy Gardner; Warrior. Although the exosuit was destroyed during combat with Militia in issue 19, Guy's power ring provided him with a new exosuit constructed of ring energy. This was much more to Guy's liking. When a grief-stricken and power-hungry Hal Jordan destroyed the Green Lantern Corps after the destruction of his hometown, Ganthet first came to Guy Gardner to offer him the last Green Lantern power ring. When Gardner refused, Ganthet decided to entrust it to Kyle Rayner.Green Lantern Secret Files & Origins #1 After Guy started having visions of Oa's destruction and his power started to mysteriously increase, he led a group of heroes to Oa to find out what happened to the Corps. Guy and his team were ambushed and quickly defeated by Parallax. Guy managed to trick Hal into thinking that he was dead by simulating a ring powered construct of himself that had been impaled by an energy pike. Guy used the element of surprise and managed to evenly match Hal in a fight for a few minutes due to the fact that his ring siphoned residual Green Lantern plasma-energy. Eventually Hal gained the upper hand, defeated Gardner and destroyed his ring, depriving him of his ring-powered exosuit. Parallax then punched out one of Gardner's eyes and sent him and his team back to Earth. Guy awoke in the hospital after spending three weeks in a coma. Deprived again of his power ring, he was forced to find an alternate means of acquiring power. Warrior: the last Vuldarian Guy would join up with the Doc Savage analogue Buck Wargo and his globe-trotting Monster Hunters, which featured obscure Silver Age hero Tiger-Man (Desmond Farr) along with Joey Hong and Rita Muldoon. On an expedition to the Amazon, Gardner found and drank from the chalice of the Warrior Water. This activated alien DNA that had been implanted in his bloodline a millennium ago by a space-traveling race called the Vuldarians. He discovered new, shapeshifting abilities that writer Beau Smith claims were editorially mandated to capitalize on the success of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,Smith, Beau. \\"A Firestorm For Guy Gardner: Warrior?\\" . Comics Bulletin. accessed September 15, 2011. and which would allow him to resume his role as a superhero. When Guy first emerged, his body had assumed the shape of his old exosuit, albeit red instead of gold, and his lost eye had been restored. Guy's body remained that way until the end of the Zero Hour storyline, morphing weapons directly out of his arms as of Zero Hour issue #2. Gardner opened a superhero theme bar called Warriors, as both a source of income and a base between his adventures. He would be joined by Buck's group, Veronna, mightiest of the Nabba Jungle tribe of women, who guarded the Warrior Water and believed herself to be destined as Guy's mate (sharing limited telepathy with him), and those who were brought on as bouncers for Warriors but acted as fellow adventurers: Lady Blackhawk (displaced in time by Zero Hour), Wildcat, Lead, and Arisia. His early days as Warrior saw him struggling with his newfound powers. He had difficulty changing his body into any weapon, and his transformations often caused him pain. After a breakdown that led to a confrontation with Superman and Supergirl, with some soul-searching help from his supposed ancestor Cardone, Gardner was finally able to use his new powers to form most non-energy-based weapons from his body, as well as absorb some forms of energy and redirect them through his various \\"weapons\\". Another ability, his capability to use the knowledge of warriors from across space and time, was rarely used and mostly forgotten. Guy had many enemies during the series including Evil Star, Gorilla Grodd, Black Serpent, Sledge, Major Force, Martika the Seductress, Bronkk and the Tormocks (ancient nemeses to the Vuldarians), Mudakka, and Dementor as well as the return of his clone (now going by the name Enforcer), the Quorum, and his brother Militia with girlfriend Honey. He teamed with many heroes including Steel, with whom he became close friends after discovering Steel attended the University of Michigan and played on the same football team.Showcase '96 #1 (January 1996) Gardner also became good friends with Lobo after the defeat of the Tormocks (so far as the bounty hunter giving Gardner one of his space bikes and the skull of Bronkk).Guy Gardner: Warrior #39 (February 1996) During the time that Gardner fought against Dementor, he learned that his enemy was also a product of Vuldarian breeding. Dementor's father had raped a Vuldarian woman. Dementor was sent to Hell, where he revealed that he was the one responsible for Gardner's constant personality shifts (in a sense, explaining why his personality changed drastically over the years). In the last issues Gardner finally dealt with his \\"family\\", as well as revealing another side of his Vuldarian powers, the ability to heal mortal wounds. Over the course of the series, Gardner made peace with a great deal of his past. On one Christmas, the Spectre, on behalf of the Phantom Stranger, made it possible for Guy to communicate with his deceased father, who apologized for the abuse, both physical and mental, he placed upon Guy, his brother Mace, and their mother. He told Guy how proud he was of all the accomplishments Guy achieved as a man and the pair reconciled. Afterward, Guy would give his condolences to Ice's mother over their shared loss of her daughter and she provided him an ice sculpture to remind him of her daughter. A celebration held at Warriors for the holiday saw Guy cross paths with an inebriated Fire and the pair shared a kiss after expressing how much they missed Ice. It was suggested they slept together after this in the following issue. After the Warrior series was canceled, Gardner continued to appear in the DC Universe; most notably as a recurring character in the Green Lantern series during Kyle Rayner's run and a reserve member of the JLA. It was thought he was killed during the Our Worlds at War crossover.JLA: Our Worlds at War #1 (September 2001) He was later discovered to be trapped in a pocket of Hell called the Gorge in General Zod's country of Pokolistan. After freeing himself by switching places with Superman villain Kancer as ruler of the Gorge, his Warrior powers were apparently enhanced. He declared it his job to do less ethical things that heroes like Superman could not.Action Comics #789Action Comics #790 (May 2002) However, this new direction only lasted for 30 issues of Guy Gardner: Warrior (which crossed over in the Way of the Warrior with Justice League America and Hawkman featuring cameos of Lobo and former Green Lantern Probert) and his many several appearances over a span of ten years. Return to the Corps During the 2005 miniseries Green Lantern: Rebirth, Gardner's Vuldarian DNA is strangely overwritten by his human DNA when Parallax possesses Gardner and several Green Lanterns. Hal Jordan's ring splits in two and Gardner's ring is restored to him. Eventually, Parallax is defeated by the combined effort of all five active Green Lanterns, including Gardner. The Guardians then select Gardner as one of the senior officers of the new Green Lantern Corps. In the 2005‚Äì2006 miniseries Green Lantern Corps: Recharge (written by Dave Gibbons), the Guardians assign Gardner to be one of the Corps' three main instructors, along with Kilowog and Kyle Rayner. The trio is responsible for the training of the new Corps, to which the Guardians intend to name 7,200 members. Gardner is not at all appreciative of his new role, and when he complains to the Guardians, they tell him that success in training new recruits could lead to him being given a new position. Gardner plays a significant role in defeating the Spider Guild attack on Oa. Discovering that trainee Soranik Natu has disappeared into the forbidden Vega star system, which the Guardians' pact with the Psions of Vega forbids Green Lanterns from entering, Gardner and Kyle Rayner led a rescue mission in direct violation of Oan policy. Once there, the Lanterns discover the Spider Guild nest and determine that its next target is the Oan sun. Returning just as the attack commences, Gardner gathers the frightened trainee Green Lanterns and rallies them with a speech that impresses even his longtime rival, Hal Jordan. Gardner's performance in repelling the attack results in his promotion to Lantern #1 of the Green Lantern Honor Guard, a position of authority over other Lanterns. In this new role, Gardner is expected to \\"think outside the box\\" and \\"do the jobs other Lanterns cannot\\", a function well-suited to his irascible personality. \\"Infinite Crisis\\" and \\"One Year Later\\" In his new role as Lantern #1, Guy leads the Corps in the defense of Oa against Superboy-Prime, creating a wall of energy to slow the rampaging teen and calling a \\"Code 54\\", authorizing the use of extreme force. Guy supervises the final capture and imprisonment of Superboy-Prime, locking him in a red Sun-Eater provided by Donna Troy and organizing a constant watch of fifty Lanterns to keep him imprisoned.Infinite Crisis #7 (June 2006) Guy spends the entire \\"missing year\\" following Infinite Crisis doing missions for the Guardians without shore leave (though he is infrequently seen on Earth in the 52 weekly limited series, it should be assumed he has sneaked away from the Guardians' watch). When he is finally granted some time off one year later, his relaxation is cut short by an attack by a grudge-holding Bolphunga the Relentless.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #5 (October 2006) Soon after, Guy assisted Hal Jordan on an unsanctioned mission to the Manhunter homeworld, Biot. Through Hal and Guy's efforts, several long- lost and believed deceased lanterns (including Arisia, Chaselon, Jack T. Chance, Graf Toren, Hannu, Ke'Haan, Laira, and Boodikka) were freed from imprisonment by the Cyborg Superman.Green Lantern vol. 4 #11 (May 2006)Green Lantern vol. 4 #12 (July 2006) Upon returning from the mission, Guy was punished by the Guardians and forced to endure one month as one of the fifty Lanterns on \\"Prime Duty\\". Lanterns of the Honor Guard, like Guy, are allowed to break the rules three times before expulsion.Green Lantern vol. 4 #13 (September 2006) According to Green Lantern writer Geoff Johns in a 2006 Newsarama interview, Prime would not be escaping under Guy's watch: \\"Not at all. That‚Äôs ridiculous. Anyone who‚Äôs read Guy Gardner for the last two years in Green Lantern or in Green Lantern Corps knows that he‚Äôs a much better, stronger character than that. And even in the old Giffen stuff, he would probably break some rules, taunt the other heroes, and drink a beer or two, but he would not be that much of an idiot. He was never that much of an idiot, and certainly not with what I'm doing with him, or with what Dave Gibbons is doing with him in Corps. He has his moments, and he‚Äôs a really fun character, but he's definitely not going to be a moron. His role is not DCU Moron. His role is DCU Shitkicker\\". The Corpse Guy was briefly part of the Corps' Black Ops division. Dubbed \\"The Corpse\\", members forsake their rings for stealthier powers provided by the Guardians. Guy took part in one mission as part of this secretive unit. He was tasked with locating Von Daggle, a Durlan who was formerly in charge of the Corpse. Gardner relayed a message from the Guardians, informing Daggle that he was reinstated. From there, Daggle took command of Gardner, leading him to the homeworld of the Dominators, a race of superscientists with a grudge against Earth. Together, they defeated a super- evolved Dominator, though the Corpse's use of lethal force did not sit well with Guy. Gardner informed Daggle that he couldn't be a part of his crew and Daggle wiped his memory, musing that \\"humans never make the cut\\". \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" In the \\"Sinestro Corps War\\" storyline, Superboy-Prime and Cyborg Superman escape imprisonment when the Sinestro Corps attacks Oa, killing the guards on Prime Duty. Guy, along with fellow Green Lanterns Hal Jordan and John Stewart, are captured by Parallax during battle and brought to Qward.Green Lantern vol. 4 #21 (July 2007) Guy and Stewart are then held prisoner by Lyssa Drak, who forces them to relive tragedies in their lives.Green Lantern vol. 4 #22 (August 2007) Hal manages to defeat Lyssa and free Guy and John from their nightmare. In the skirmish following their escape, Parallax nearly breaks Gardner's neck. Upon returning to their universe, they defend Earth from the entire Sinestro Corps.Green Lantern vol. 4 #23 (September 2007) After helping to free Kyle from Parallax's possession, Parallax is split into four pieces by former Guardians Ganthet and Sayd, and placed into the power batteries of Hal, John, Guy, and Kyle.Green Lantern vol. 4 #24 (October 2007) Guy is infected by the Sinestro Corps' deadly alien virus named Despotellis, but cured by the Green Lantern Corps' own sentient smallpox virus, Leezle Pon.Green Lantern vol. 4 #25 (December 2007) Return of Ice Within the aftermath of the Sinestro Corps War, Guy was finally reunited with former girlfriend Ice, recently resurrected. Despite Ice's uncertainty as to the wisdom of reviving the old romance, Guy's professions of adoration seemed sufficient to convince her to meet him for a proper date on the same spot exactly one month later.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #19 (December 2007) Before leaving Earth to open a bar/restaurant on Oa, Guy leaves Ice a note.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #20 (January 2008) Ice declines his proposal to cohabit on Oa, and Guy reads her desire to rebuild a new life on Earth with her best friend Beatriz as an attempt to distance from him, accusing Beatriz of pitting Ice against him. The two agree that their current situations will make a relationship impossible.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #29 (October 2008) \\"Blackest Night\\" In the \\"Blackest Night\\" storyline, Guy and Kyle Rayner are opposed to the Guardians' decision to execute all Sinestro Corps members and all other prisoners and attempt unsuccessfully to convince the Alpha Lanterns and the Guardians themselves to stay away from the dark path on which they are headed, and are reassigned to Earth.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #38 (July 2009) They later try to return to Oa, and fail to repel an invasion of a swarm of black rings to Oa's Lantern crypt, where the corpses of fallen Lanterns are reanimated as Black Lanterns.Blackest Night #1 (August 2009)Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #39 (August 2009) In the ensuing conflict, Guy is forced to crush the body of the insectoid Bzzd, but is then impaled through the leg by Ke'Haan.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #40 (September 2009) After Kyle is killed in the explosion of Chaselon's power battery,Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #42 (November 2009) Guy flies into a rage, and is transformed into a Red Lantern. Now powered by both of his green and red power rings, Guy seeks vengeance against the Black Lanterns and is able to destroy them on sight effortlessly with his combined weapons.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #43 (December 2009) Despite Kyle's resurrection at the hands of Star Sapphire Miri Riam, Guy turns his murderous rage on his former friends,Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #44 (January 2010) before Mogo purges the Red Lantern rage from him, though he is told only a Blue Lantern can cure him completely. He then joins the battle against Nekron on Earth.Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #45 (February 2010) Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors After the events of Blackest Night, Guy Gardner starred in the monthly series Emerald Warriors, written by Peter Tomasi.Seguar, Alex. \\"More BRIGHTEST DAY news: A new GREEN LANTERN title and GLC changes\\". DC Comics: The Source. February 2010 While searching for a cure for his Red Lantern rage,Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors #2 (September 2010) it is revealed that Guy entered into an alliance with Red Lantern leader Atrocitus, which briefly alienates Guy from Kilowog and Arisia.Tomasi, Peter J. Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors #5-7 In the \\"War of the Green Lanterns\\" storyline, the influence of Parallax, now restored to the Central Power Battery,Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors #8 forces Guy and the other Earth Lanterns to use the rings of other Corps. Guy, citing his experience with the Red Lanterns, chooses the red power ring.Green Lantern vol. 4 #65 During their conflict with the Green Lantern Corps,Green Lantern Corps vol. 2 #59 Guy and his allies release Parallax from the Central Power Battery, Guy using the Star Sapphire ring in conjunction with the Red Lantern ring, drawing on his love of the Corps and his hatred and his anger to power both rings at once, the two emotional extremes proving sufficient to release Parallax from the battery. Guy is subsequently cleansed of the Red Lantern energy by Kyle Rayner's blue ring before each reclaims his usual ring.Green Lantern: Emerald Warriors #10 The New 52 Red Lantern in The New 52, as depicted in Red Lanterns #34 (2014) Gardner, John Stewart, and an elite Green Lantern Strike Team star in a relaunched Green Lantern Corps series, which debuted in September 2011 as part of DC's The New 52 relaunch. This series debuted with author Peter J. Tomasi and art by Fernando Pasarin and Scott Hanna. Guy is also shown on the cover for the new Justice League International series that was released that same month, written by Dan Jurgens and with art by Aaron Lopresti. Initially, Guy appeared to be the one Earth Green Lantern that the Guardians still appeared to rely on, what with Hal having been expelled after War of the Green Lanterns, Kyle being expelled due to his alliance with the other ring- wielders, and John being put on trial for killing another Lantern. However, the Guardians were really planning to undermine all four Earth Lanterns by sabotaging Guy's career after building it up, ensuring a precipitous fall.Green Lantern vol. 5 #12 (August 2012) This plan begins when the Guardians promote Guy to the role of 'Sentinel Lantern' and entrust him with guarding a group of ambassadors travelling to a planet for a crucial conference. They subsequently release Guy's old enemy Xar from the Science cells and create the impression that he is going after Guy's family on Earth. They predicted that Guy would abandon his duty and return to Earth while Xar attacks the ambassadors.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3 #13 (September 2012) With the rest of his team having been absorbed by the Third Army, Guy escapes only through his strength of will, averting the Third Army's attempt to 'recruit' him. With Xar having killed the ambassadors, the Guardians order Guy to resign from the Corps in order to redeem the damage he has done.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3 #14 (November 2012) Feeling depressed after a phone conversation with his family, during which his father dismisses superheroes as overly reliant on their powers, Guy attempts to spend the night fighting crime with only his natural skills. This backfires when he interrupts a police sting operation, culminating in him being arrested by his sister.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3 #15 (December 2012) While in prison, he is attacked by the Third Army, but is rescued by Green Lanterns Simon Baz and B'dg, who send the civilians to safety before crushing the Third Army and retreating to the Sea of Tranquility on the moon.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3 #16 (January 2013) Guy is angered when he discovers that the Guardians have turned against him and the Corps. Simon and B'dg dispatch him to the planet Oa. There, Guy reclaims his ring and joins Kilowog and the others reserve Corps members in their rebellion against the treacherous Guardians.Green Lantern Corps Annual #1 (January 2013) After the villainous First Lantern is destroyed and the unemotional Guardians are killed off by Sinestro, Guy and Kilowog locate where Salaak was imprisoned by the Guardians and free him. Guy is angered when he discovers Salaak's surveillance footage of Xar being released by the Guardians. Salaak helps him locate Xar‚Äôs whereabouts, and discovers that Xar is located on Earth and preparing to kill off Guy's family. Guy manages to speed up with Saint Walker's willing assistance to arrive in time to blast Xar to be incinerated, and reunites with his family.Green Lantern Corps vol. 3 #20 (May 2013) Following the event, Guy was placed in the cast of the Red Lanterns series where he was sent by Hal Jordan to join the Red Lanterns undercover. He defeats Atrocitus and takes command of the group. It is revealed that part of his decision to join with the Red Lanterns is feeling as if he has never fit in as a Green Lantern.Red Lanterns #21 (June 2013) As a Red Lantern Gardner manages to keep his rage in check, successfully leading most of the Red Lanterns; Atrocitus leads a splinter group and allows new Red rings to cause murderous justice-based rampages to continue. After joining with the Green Lanterns to defeat the cosmic terrorist Relic, Hal promises to give the Red Lanterns a sector for them to watch over, unwittingly this sector becomes Sector 2814, where Earth resides, giving guardianship of Earth to the Red Lantern Corps.Red Lanterns #28 Guy also tries to reunite with Ice but she has undergone several personal revelations of her own and needs time apart; Guy promises to give her just that.Red Lanterns #28 (March, 2014) Powers and abilities=Power rings Guy Gardner was trained to use a Green Lantern power ring, which is only limited by the user's will power. He later acquired Sinestro's Qwardian power ring, which was later revealed to be based on the bearer's control of fear. This early version of a yellow power ring was powered by absorbing plasma radiation that had been expelled from a Green Lantern ring and seemed to make Guy more invulnerable than a normal Green Lantern power-ring. He used both for basic Lantern abilities including constructs, flight, and energy projection, though it also caused him some difficulty on occasion. For example, if he asked it a question he would get an answer in Qwardian, which he didn't speak. In Green Lantern: Rebirth #6 it is mentioned that Guy Gardner's ring is constantly sparking with energy, as if unable to contain the power of his will. Following Kyle Rayner's apparent death, Guy's rage caused a red power ring to latch onto him, bestowing on him the ability to generate napalm like flames that would burn even in space. Unlike most Red Lanterns, Guy retained his intelligence, and, like Hal Jordan when he was under the thrall of a red ring, Guy was able to shape the red flames into solid constructs. Unlike Hal, Guy's green ring remained active, allowing him to combine the two lights and obliterate the Black Lanterns and their rings. Guy was also the first male character seen to wield a love-powered Star Sapphire ring, wearing it in conjunction with the Red Lantern ring (he stated that the result felt like he had blood and sugar in his mouth). During the events of the Green Lanterns: The Lost Army, Guy created a new uniform using both his green and red rings. Later during the final battle, the Power Converters used by Lightsmiths, converted Guy's Red Lantern Ring to a Green Lantern ring, thus ending his connection to the Red Lantern Corps.Green Lantern: The Lost Army #6 Vuldarian powers Guy's Vuldarian powers included limited shapeshifting abilities in which he could create weapons out of his body. At first, these transformations caused him pain and he was unable to shrink from his 7-foot height. He maintained super strength, stamina, and durability around Superman's strata, the power of flight, capable of surviving in outer space unassisted, accelerated healing, and had access to the memories of deceased Vuldarians (touted as the most dangerous warriors in the history of the universe). Trained by the Vuldarian Cardone, Gardner became highly trained in using his abilities and practiced extensively in the martial arts. During the return of Parallax, he suffered a metahuman power discharge and his Vuldarian abilities went into recession. Coincidentally, when he awoke he was near Hal Jordan's power ring, which has the ability to duplicate itself. Gardner once more had a power ring, and following the return of the Guardians of the Universe, he was once again a Green Lantern. Green Lantern (Tangent Comics) Guy became the caretaker of a mystical artifact that survived the events of the 2005 \\"Infinite Crisis\\" storyline, after it was discovered on New Earth by Kyle Rayner. It has the power to temporarily awaken the dead and has also served as a dimensional gateway. The Guardians eventually used the artifact for a ritual to merge the willpower entity Ion with Sodam Yat during the Sinestro Corps War.

He goes to Earth with Ganthet, however, when he learns Kyle Rayner had disappeared (he had actually been killed by Sinestro). The two meet with Superman to confront him about his activities to force peace, but the Man of Steel refuses to listen. As Hal Jordan leaves with Ganthet for Oa, Guy remains behind to watch over Earth. He eventually leaves when he discovers Superman has allied himself with the Sinestro Corps, spending the next seven months building an army of Green Lanterns to combat Superman. He returns to try and reason with Superman one final time, but the war begins. Guy goes to Earth to confront Hal about his choosing Superman over the Corps, and saves Carol Ferris. Near the end of Year Two, Guy is confronted by a now Yellow Lantern Hal, who falsely believes that Guy killed John Stewart (when it was again Sinestro, who put the blame on Guy). Though he tries to convince Hal he is being manipulated, Hal rips off Guy's broken arm and sends him falling to his death. **In the prequel comic of the sequel Injustice 2, Guy appears as a manifestation of Hal's guilt in his head. * In the possible future of Futures End, Guy Gardner became a Blue Lantern, having tried several other Lantern Corps Power Rings to determine which is best to get rid of the Red Lanterns. After defeating and purifying Red King Jack/Rankoor, Guy purifies Bleez, restoring her to normal and destroying all the Red Power Rings, effectively putting an end to the Red Lantern Corps. In other media=Television * Guy Gardner has only been portrayed once to date in live- action TV. In 1997, Matthew Settle played him in a Keith Giffen-inspired pilot for a proposed TV series Justice League of America. The personification of the character is very much an amalgam of Earth's various Lanterns. His uniform is based on the \\"sleeveless vest\\" comics version of Guy Gardner, though he wears a mask and insignia that resemble those of Kyle Rayner's first costume. Further, his appearance and personality more accurately mirror those of Hal Jordan. * Guy Gardner appears (alongside the Green Lantern Corps) in a non- spoken cameo role in the Duck Dodgers episode, \\"The Green Loontern\\". * Guy Gardner appears in the animated series Batman: The Brave and the Bold in the opening of \\"Day of the Dark Knight!\\" and was voiced by James Arnold Taylor. His antics caused a prisoner to go on a path of destructive rage, but Batman, already at Corps headquarters, recaptures the prisoner. He reappears in \\"The Eyes of Despero!\\" to help Batman overthrow dictator Despero. He, Sinestro, and G'nort create Bat-armor for the job when Batman insists on accompanying the Lanterns. When he sees Sinestro attempting to blow up a rogue Mogo; they do battle, and Guy wins. Guy imprisons Sinestro in his ring at the end of the episode. This episode also pays homage to the iconic scene in the comics, when Batman knocks Gardner out with one punch after an argument. In \\"Revenge of the Reach!\\", he initially clashes with Jaime Reyes, believing that he is evil because of the Reach-created suit he wears. After Jaime saves Oa from the attack of other Reach agents, Guy's attitude towards him improves; he even sticks up for him when the Guardians attempt to confiscate his armor. Guy appears in \\"Death Race to Oblivion!\\" as one of many heroes and villains racing to save the Earth from destruction at the hands of Mongul. In the teaser for \\"The Siege of Starro! Part One\\", Guy is shown fighting off heroes who have fallen under Starro's control, though he is soon put in the same position. In \\"Darkseid Descending!\\", Guy Gardner joins the Justice League International. He seems to have a crush on team member Ice, as seen in Time out of Vengeance when they travel back in time to the pre-historic cave man era. * Guy Gardner appears in Young Justice, voiced by Troy Baker in a Maryland accent. Unlike the other Green Lanterns shown, his costume is quite different from the one he wears in the comics. In \\"Revelation\\", he is shown helping Black Canary, Green Arrow and Red Arrow rescue children from the Injustice League's plant creature. In \\"Agendas\\", the Flash mentions that Guy Gardner could be a Justice League member. However, John Stewart and Hal Jordan (both League members) immediately dismiss the idea. In season 2, it was mentioned that he is a member of the League and is on a mission. In Season 3, he, Superman, Wonder Woman and Hawkwoman investigate an attack on Thanagar, that eventually leads them onto the tracks of Granny Goodness's metahuman trafficking stash, though they fail in releasing the metahuman kids. * Guy Gardner appears in Green Lantern: The Animated Series, voiced by Diedrich Bader. He appears as Hal Jordan's replacement while he was away. When Hal returns to his city, Guy helps him save a runaway crane. When Hal is about to talk to the news lady, Guy pushes him out of the way and takes the credit. Guy later finds out Hal was the Lantern before him and invites him to grab a bite. The two eat hot wings on a roof while Hal contacts the Guardians to ask them about Guy. The Guardians inform Hal that Guy is the new Lantern of Earth. When the Guardians see Guy, they invite him to attend a party with them. Guy accepts forcing Hal to hang up. Hal gets furious and the two engage in battle. Their battle starts at Coast City and ends in the desert. They stop when they come to a temple full of Manhunters. Hal and Guy fight them off and end up destroying them. Hal contacts Salaak to ask about the Manhunters. Salaak decides to look into it and when he spots Guy, he asks, \\"Is that Guy Gardner?\\" But Hal hangs up before he could answer. Then Hal's girlfriend Carol Ferris calls and breaks up with him. Guy comforts him and relates to his situation. The two shake hands and become friends. Then Guy asks if he can ask Carol out which ends up with Hal punching him in the face. Then the Guardians summon Hal to Oa and Guy asks Hal to put in a good word for him. In \\"Ranx\\", Guy meets Hal again when he reveals he has been quickly appointed to Honor Guard (his place having been taken by John Stewart) and is led a brigade of Green Lanterns to stop the Manhunters from destroying the planet Ranx, which is containing the still-living head of the Anti-Monitor. In \\"Dark Matter\\", he also gets on Kilowog's bad side and helps try to defeat the Aya-Monitor once and for all. Film * In the early script for the Green Lantern live-action film, Gardner was set to make a cameo as a football player who was about to be chosen by the ring, before it went to Hal Jordan.

Called \\"Santiago of eight valleys of Moyobamba\\" or \\"Maynas capital\\". There are 50,073 inhabitants, according to the 2017 census. Some 3,500 species of orchids are native to the area, which has led to the city's nickname of The City of Orchids. The city is the capital of both Moyobamba Province and Moyobamba District. The city is linked by road with Tarapoto to the southeast, Rioja to the west and Bagua to the northwest. Roads connect Moyobamba to the Pacific coast by way of Bagua and Olmos to the north and Cajamarca to the southwest. History The first colonies were from the Chachapoyas culture, but the modern city of Moyobamba was established by Juan P√©rez de Guevara on 25 July 1540, who named it Santiago de los Ocho Valles de Moyobamba (Santiago of the eight Moyobamba Valleys). It was founded on the site of an Inca settlement and was the first city founded by the Spanish in the Peruvian Amazon. It is the second oldest Spanish town east of the Andes. During the Spanish Conquest, Moyobamba was a base from which incursions were made into the surrounding areas. The city was the seat of the first religious missions established in the region. The Roman Catholic Church used the city as a base, where it began the task of converting the natives to Christianity. It was an important commercial center during the colonial era (1533‚Äì1821) and it was given city status in 1857. The historic \\"Puerto de Tahuishco\\" was once a vibrant port along the Mayo River, but has since become one of the last waning vestiges of the river trade route. On 7 June 1897, Moyobamba was made the capital of the Loreto Region. On 4 September 1906, it became the capital of the San Mart√≠n Region. It was named the seat of the Territorial Prelature of Moyobamba in 1948. On September 25, 2005, Moyobamba was affected by the 2005 northern Peru earthquake. Geography Coryanthes macrantha Moyobamba is famous for its large number of native Orchids The city sits on a bluff overlooking the Mayo River, at 2,820 feet (860 m) above sea level, in the humid, tropical region known as the Ceja de selva. Native Orchids are the most famous of the Moyobamba flora. The surrounding area consists of rivers, caves, waterfalls, hot springs and lakes. These include the Tioyacu River and the subterranean river in the cave of the Huacharos (Cueva de los Huacharos), the natural hot springs at San Mateo, the Laguna Azul lake, the Ahuashiyacu and the Gera waterfalls. Demographics The demographics of Moyobamba is a mix of cultures and people of different origins. The Caucasian group includes people from Spain and Italy with smaller groups of people from Armenia, Syria, Germany, and Poland and forms 70 percent of the population; the \\"mixed people\\" (amerindian with caucasian) form 25 percent of total population. The remaining 5 percent of the population includes Chinese, Japanese, Quechua and other amerindians (amazonian groups), and people of black origins. One small group people, descendants of Armenians, Jews, and Germans have the higher education and economic rate in the city; many of their members emigrated from Moyobamba to other areas and are very active in politics, economy, trade and education in largest cities of Peru (like Lima, Trujillo, Arequipa, Ica and Chiclayo). Economy Moyobamba is the center of a large agricultural region and one of the major trading centers for the Aguaruna Native Communities which inhabit the surrounding valley known as the Upper Mayo River Valley. The most lucrative crops grown in the region include rice, coffee, and corn. Cotton, sugarcane, tobacco and cocoa are also produced. Alcohol, liquor, wines, and straw hats are produced in the city. Hot springs, gold, and some petroleum are found nearby. After the slow demise of its airport, this regional capital began to fall behind the faster-developing Tarapoto, a neighboring city further down-river. Farmers and regional government workers often clash in a geopolitical battle over local control and access to outside markets. Festivities=Fiesta de San Juan \\"Moyobambinos\\" (residents of Moyobamba) celebrate the region's patron saint (San Juan - Saint John) every year on June 24. Locals celebrate with traditional dances and dishes, most notably Juane, a dish that is meant to resemble the head of John the Baptist on a platter before Herod Antipas. It is made by stuffing a ball of sticky green rice with chicken and wrapping it in bijao (Heliconia bihai) leaves for cooking. Then celebrants dance the \\"Pandilla\\" around wooden poles dug into the ground before chopping them down with an axe and collecting the treasures from the top. Climate Moyobamba has a tropical climate of rainy, semi-warm and humid savanna. The temperature varies between 14 ¬∞C (minimum) and 30 ¬∞C (maximum), being 22 ¬∞C as the average temperature throughout the year. On some nights in Moyobamba it is colder.

There are various traditions of solo and mock-battle (Pyrrhic) sword dances from Africa, Asia and Europe. General types of sword dance include: *solo dancers around swords - such as the traditional Scottish sword dances. This general form also encompasses non-sword dances such as the bacca pipes jig in Cotswold morris dance, *mock-battle dances, including many stick dances from non-sword traditions, and such common continental dances as Bouffons or Mattachins as described by Thoinot Arbeau in 1588. *hilt-and-point sword dances - where the dancers are linked together by their swords in a chain. These form the basis for rapper sword and long sword forms. China and Vietnam Lady Gongsun of the Tang dynasty, who was known for her elegant sword dancing, as depicted in Gathering Gems of Beauty (Áï´È∫óÁè†ËêÉÁßÄ) Sword dances in China and Vietnam, known as jian wu or m√∫a ki·∫øm, began as a military training exercise with swords and spears which evolved into an elaborate acrobatic dance. Jian wu was one of four classical dances that were used in the Chinese and Vietnamese opera. Each of these dances was very meaningful within the opera performances and they often were used for plot descriptions and characterization. Sword dancing also found a use in Chinese and Vietnamese cultures through communicating with the supernatural; sword dancing was done in an effort to communicate feelings to the dead spirits that may be disrupting a household. There are quite a few styles within the actual art of sword dancing. The first style focuses on relaxation and flexibility while the other style focuses on speed and strength. There are also different types of swords and weapons used during each dance. A long sword is usually wielded with slower dramatic movements during a solo performance while shorter scimitars are used at a very high pace during a sword dance between two or more people. Each style requires certain movements that require the dancer to be highly agile and athletic. Indian subcontinent Many sword-dances in the Indian subcontinent originated with the martial traditions of the region, the paragon of which exemplified in the long-established Gatka tradition, arising from the tenet of monolithic, theosophical militarization found within Sikhism. The paika akhada which were previously used to train Orissan warriors now perform weapon dances in the streets during festivals. Other dances like the mer dandiya are simply theatrical depictions of battle, while some like the choliya of the Kumaon region were used to ward off evil spirits. Sword dances are still commonly performed for weddings and other occasions in the Indian subcontinent today. Indian subcontinent In the Indian subcontinent, the chhau sword dance, Khasi tribal sword dance, Bhotiya tribe sword dance, Lakharu-li sword dance, Khaijama-Phanai sword dance, Gujarat sword dance and the Khattak sword dance are performed on festive occasions. Middle East A thumb Arab sword dances (raqs al-sa√Øf) evolved out of sword fighting between men, in both Egypt and Turkey. There was even a time when sword dancing was banned by the sultan during Ottoman rule, as it was believed that dancers, who took swords from soldiers and pretended to \\"kill\\" them at the end of the performances, collected the swords to begin a resistance against the army. These swords were never returned. Female sword dancing was not widespread in West Asia. Men in Egypt performed a dance called el ard, a martial dance involving upraised swords, but women were not widely known to use swords as props during their dancing in public. However, paintings and engravings by French artist Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me (who visited Egypt in the 18th century) show sword dancers balancing sabers on their heads. The Turkish Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Kalkan dance of Bursa is performed exclusively by men with a sword and shield, and represents the Ottoman conquest of the city. The performers wear early Ottoman battle dress and dance to the sound of clashing swords and shields without music. Mock-battle Mock battle sword dances are found worldwide, varying from the Greek Xiphism, the ancient Roman Saltatio Armatum, to Asian mock-battles. Some European sword dances, such as Moreshka from the island of Korƒçula in Croatia, include both hilt-and-point and mock battle sequences. Linked Hilt-and-point sword dances are, or were, performed all over Europe. These are particularly concentrated in an area corresponding to the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire at around 1400-1500, and many of these traditional dances are still performed in England, Czech Republic, Germany, Austria, North Italy, France, Flanders, and the Iberian Peninsula, with a particular concentration in Basque Country, Galicia and Andalusia. Sword dances performed by the guilds of Smiths and Cutlers in Nuremberg are recorded from 1350. 16th century records of sword dances survive from all over Germany. Depictions of dances survive from Z√ºrich (1578) and Nuremberg (1600). In Scotland a dance was recorded as being performed in 1285, but this was found in a document from 1440. An important concentration of traditional sword dances can be found on the Italian side of the western Alps. Main sites are Giaglione, Venaus and S. Giorio in the Susa valley, where the so-called \\"Spadonari\\" (sword-holders) dance is still now performed between the end of January and the beginning of February. This dance is also connected with the rebirth of nature and vegetation. In Romania, in a dance called Calusari, a sword dance similar to a Morris Dance, is part of a more complex ritualistic dance involving elements of fertility ritual and horse worship. Hilt-and-point sword dances traditional to England include rapper sword and long sword, although both of these are now also performed by revival teams outside their traditional areas, including teams in most of the English-speaking world. English sword dancing has also been brought to the New World, initially as part of the \\"morris revival\\" of the 1970s and 1980s. Teams are now extant in most major metropolitan areas in North America. The New York City Sword Ale is an annual gathering over Presidents' Day weekend that brings together over a dozen sword teams form the east coast and around the world.

The Old Dictionary of National Biography article confuses both brothers and their father all together. Life Born near Woodbridge, Suffolk, England, Seckford was educated at Cambridge, and in 1540 entered Gray's Inn. Thomas became one of Queen Elizabeth I‚Äôs two Masters in Ordinary of the Court of Requests (from 1558 probably until death) which dealt with poor men‚Äôs causes. One of the duties of this post was to accompany the monarch as she journeyed around her realm. He would thus have been particularly known to the Queen. He is believed to have played a prominent part in arranging the Elizabethan Church Settlement. In 1564, she sold him the manor of Woodbridge, including the site of Woodbridge Priory, and he became a benefactor to both the church and town.The Abbey (Junior School), Woodbridge, British Listed Buildings. Retrieved 2011-05-01. He was junior Knight of the Shire (MP) for Suffolk in 1571. He was an MP for Ripon in November 1554, for Orford in 1555 and 1558, for Ipswich in 1559, 1563 and 1572 and for Suffolk in 1571.History of Parliament online. Elizabeth is known to have held court at the Seckford family seat, Seckford Hall. In 1574 Thomas commissioned Christopher Saxton to survey all the English counties and produce an atlas of the realm. This was published in 1579, the first ever done from an actual survey. Elizabeth granted him a patent for its sole publication for ten years. He founded seven almshouses in Woodbridge in 1586 which he endowed with an income of ¬£112 13s 4d (¬£112.66p) per year from land in Clerkenwell, Middlesex. He also paid for the old Woodbridge Abbey to be rebuilt. His wealth is still benefiting Woodbridge today. He died in 1587 aged 72, never having had children, and was buried in a chapel on the north side of St. Mary's Church which is now an organ chamber. His coat of arms can be seen in the north window of the west wall of the church. Sekforde Street in Clerkenwell, London, is built on land once owned by Seckford and is named for him. Sekforde Street adjoins Woodbridge Street, laid out at the same time in the 1830s. In the film About a Boy starring Hugh Grant the main character, Will, lives in a flat in No.1 Sekforde Street (actual research shows the temporary movie-set doorway was constructed at 16-18 St James's Walk, the same glazed-brick building but around the corner.)

Du Preez made his test debut for the Springboks on 7 January 1961 in the flank position against England at Twickenham. He played his last test on 7 August 1971 at the age of 35 as a lock against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Du Preez was an excellent all-round footballer, and like Australian lock John Eales, he was that rare phenomenon: a lock that could kick and even drop kick. Although he was not particularly tall, he was a tower of strength in the line-out. In addition he had a fantastic turn of speed and fine running skills with ball in hand, as he showed in the try he scored against the British Lions in 1968.

Long thought to be symbiotic with the mussels (whose larval phase attaches to fish gills during development), recent research has indicated they are in fact parasitic, with co-evolution being seen in Chinese bitterling and mussel species. Bitterlings usually reside in areas with dense plant growth. They are hardy fish, and can survive in water that is not very well oxygenated. They grow to be 3-4 in long at most. The bitterling's diet consists of plant material and small larvae of insects.

The scientific name is derived from the Greek word ', meaning \\"rose\\". Most species in the genus are restricted to Asia, but two species are found in Europe (R. amarus and R. meridionalis). Bitterlings are short-lived species, generally surviving only about five years. Their maximum size is 11 cm, but they are usually much shorter. Bitterlings inhabit slow-flowing or still waters, such as ponds, lakes, marshes, muddy and sandy pools, and river backwaters. Because they depend on freshwater mussels to reproduce, their range is restricted. Bitterlings are omnivorous, feeding on both invertebrates and plants. Bitterlings have a remarkable reproduction strategy where parents transfer responsibility for the care of their young to various species of freshwater mussels (Unionidae and Margaritiferidae). The female extends her long ovipositor into the mantle cavity of the mussel and deposits her eggs between the gill filaments. The male then ejects his sperm into the mussel's inhalent water current and fertilization takes place within the gills of the host. The same female may use a number of mussels, and she deposits only one or two yellow, oval eggs into each. Early developmental stages are protected from predation within the body of the mussel. After 3 to 4 weeks, larvae swim away from the hosts to continue life on their own. In 1936, the bitterling was thought to respond to hormones in a pregnant woman's urine, but the work was later discredited. Species This genus and Acheilognathus have a convoluted taxonomic history, one being at times included in the other. They are now considered separate, but some species formerly in Rhodeus are now in Acheilognathus. There are currently 21 recognized species in this genus: *Rhodeus albomarginatus F. Li & R.

Gabriel told Mary to name her son Jesus, meaning \\"YHWH is salvation\\". According to , the Annunciation occurred \\"in the sixth month\\" of Elizabeth's pregnancy with John the Baptist. Many Christians observe this event with the Feast of the Annunciation on 25 March, an approximation of the northern vernal equinox nine full months before Christmas, the ceremonial birthday of Jesus. The Annunciation is a key topic in Christian art in general, as well as in Marian art in the Catholic Church, having been especially prominent during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. A work of art depicting the Annunciation is sometimes itself called an Annunciation.

The virgin's name was Mary. 28 The > angel went to her and said, \\"Greetings, you who are highly favoured!

Eastern Christianity Annunciation to Zechariah, taken from an Ethiopian Bible (c. 1700), kept at the British Library Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation, Nazareth In the Eastern Orthodox, Eastern Catholic, and Oriental Orthodox Churches, the Feast of the Annunciation is one of the twelve \\"Great Feasts\\" of the liturgical year, and is among the eight of them that are counted as \\"feasts of the Lord\\". Throughout the Orthodox Church, the feast is celebrated on March 25. In the churches that use the new style Calendar (Revised Julian or Gregorian), this date coincides with March 25 on the civil calendar, while in those churches using the old style Julian calendar, March 25 is reckoned to fall on April 7 on the civil calendar, and will fall on April 8 starting in the year 2100. The traditional hymn (troparion) for the feast of the Annunciation goes back to St Athanasius. It runs:Speaking the Truth in Love: Theological and Spiritual Exhortations by John Chryssavgis, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomu 2010 page 85 > Today is the beginning of our salvation, And the revelation of the eternal > mystery! The Son of God becomes the Son of the Virgin As Gabriel announces > the coming of Grace. Together with him let us cry to the Theotokos: > \\"Rejoice, O Full of Grace, the Lord is with you!\\" As the action initiating the Incarnation of Christ, Annunciation has such an important place in Orthodox Christian theology that the festal Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom is always celebrated on the feast, even if it falls on Great and Holy Friday, the day when the crucifixion of Jesus is remembered. Indeed, the Divine Liturgy is celebrated on Great and Holy Friday only when the latter coincides with the feast of the Annunciation. If the Annunciation falls on Pascha (Easter Sunday) itself, a coincidence which is called Kyriopascha, then it is celebrated jointly with the Resurrection, which is the focus of Easter. Due to these and similar rules, the rubrics surrounding the celebration of the feast are the most complex of all in Orthodox Christian liturgics. St Ephraim taught that the date of the conception of Jesus Christ fell on 10 Nisan on the Hebrew calendar, the day in which the passover lamb was selected according to Exodus 12. Some years 10 Nisan falls on March 25, which is the traditional date for the Feast of the Annunciation and is an official holiday in Lebanon. Churches marking the location of the Annunciation Both the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches hold that the Annunciation took place at Nazareth, but slightly differ as to the precise location. The Basilica of the Annunciation marks the site preferred by the former, while the Greek Orthodox Church of the Annunciation marks that preferred by the latter. Feast day miniature The feast of the Annunciation is usually held on March 25. It is moved in the Catholic Church, Anglican and Lutheran liturgical calendars when that date falls during Holy Week or Easter Week or on a Sunday. The Eastern Orthodox Church, Oriental Orthodoxy, and Eastern Catholic Churches do not move the feast. Instead they have special combined liturgies for those years when the Annunciation coincides with another feast. In these churches, even on Good Friday a Divine Liturgy is celebrated when it coincides with the Annunciation. One of the most frequent accusations brought against New Calendarism is the fact that in the New Calendar churches (which celebrate the Annunciation according to the New Calendar, but Easter according to the Old Calendar), these special Liturgies can never be celebrated any more, since the Annunciation is always long before Holy Week on the New Calendar. The Old Calendarists believe that this impoverishes the liturgical and spiritual life of the Church Greek Independence Day is celebrated on the feast of the Annunciation and 25 March is also a national holiday in the Lebanon. When the calendar system of Anno Domini was first introduced by Dionysius Exiguus in 525, he assigned the beginning of the new year to March 25 since, according to Catholic theology, the era of grace began with the Incarnation of Christ. The first certain mentions of the feast are in a canon of the 656 Council of Toledo, where it is described as celebrated throughout the church. The 692 Council of Constantinople \\"in Trullo\\" forbade observance of any festivals during Lent, excepting Sunday and the Feast of the Annunciation. An earlier origin had been claimed for it on the grounds that it appeared in manuscripts of the sermons of Athanasius and Gregory Thaumaturgus but they were subsequently discovered to be spurious. Along with Easter, March 25 was used as the New Year's Day in many pre-modern Christian countries. The holiday was moved to January 1 in France by Charles IX's 1564 Edict of Roussillon. In England, the feast of the Annunciation came to be known as Lady Day, and Lady Day marked the beginning of the English new year until 1752. Also in England, the 1240 Synod of Worcester banned all servile work during the Feast of the Annunciation, making it a day of rest. In Christian art The Annunciation has been one of the most frequent subjects of Christian art.The Oxford Companion to Christian Art and Architecture by Peter Murray and Linda Murray 1996 page 23Images of the Mother of God: by Maria Vassilaki 2005 pages 158‚Äì159 Depictions of the Annunciation go back to early Christianity, with the Priscilla catacomb including the oldest known fresco of the Annunciation, dating to the 4th century.The Annunciation To Mary by Eugene LaVerdiere 2007 page 29 It has been a favorite artistic subject in both the Christian East and as Roman Catholic Marian art, particularly during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and figures in the repertoire of almost all of the great masters. The figures of the virgin Mary and the angel Gabriel, being emblematic of purity and grace, were favorite subjects of Roman Catholic Marian art, where the scene is also used to represent the perpetual virginity of Mary via the announcement by the angel Gabriel that Mary would conceive a child to be born the Son of God. Works on the subject have been created by artists such as Sandro Botticelli, Leonardo da Vinci, Caravaggio, Duccio, Jan van Eyck, and Murillo among others. The mosaics of Pietro Cavallini in Santa Maria in Trastevere in Rome (1291), the frescos of Giotto in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua (1303), Domenico Ghirlandaio's fresco at the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence (1486), and Donatello's gilded sculpture at the church of Santa Croce, Florence (1435) are famous examples.

The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) is the codification of the general and permanent rules and regulations (sometimes called administrative law) published in the Federal Register by the executive departments and agencies of the federal government of the United States. The CFR is divided into 50 titles that represent broad areas subject to federal regulation. The CFR annual edition is the codification of the general and permanent rules published by the Office of the Federal Register (part of the National Archives and Records Administration) and the Government Publishing Office. In addition to this annual edition, the CFR is published in an unofficial format online on the Electronic CFR website, which is updated daily. Background Under the nondelegation doctrine, federal agencies are authorized by \\"enabling legislation\\" to promulgate regulations (rulemaking). The process of rulemaking is governed by the Administrative Procedure Act (APA): generally, the APA requires a process that includes publication of the proposed rules in a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), a period for comments and participation in the decisionmaking, and adoption and publication of the final rule, via the Federal Register. Publication procedure The rules and regulations are first promulgated or published in the Federal Register. The CFR is structured into 50 subject matter titles. Agencies are assigned chapters within these titles. The titles are broken down into chapters, parts, sections and paragraphs. For example, 42 CFR 260.11(a)(1) would be read as \\"title 42, part 260, section 11, paragraph (a)(1).\\" While new regulations are continually becoming effective, the printed volumes of the CFR are issued once each calendar year, on this schedule: *Titles 1‚Äì16 are updated as of January 1 *Titles 17‚Äì27 are updated as of April 1 *Titles 28‚Äì41 are updated as of July 1 *Titles 42‚Äì50 are updated as of October 1 The Office of the Federal Register also keeps an unofficial, online version of the CFR, the e-CFR, which is normally updated within two days after changes that have been published in the Federal Register become effective.

The first edition of the CFR was published in 1938. Beginning in 1963 for some titles and for all titles in 1967, the Office of the Federal Register began publishing yearly revisions, and beginning in 1972 published revisions in staggered quarters. On March 11, 2014, Rep. Darrell Issa introduced the Federal Register Modernization Act (H.R. 4195; 113th Congress), a bill that would revise requirements for the filing of documents with the Office of the Federal Register for inclusion in the Federal Register and for the publication of the Code of Federal Regulations to reflect the changed publication requirement in which they would be available online but would not be required to be printed. The American Association of Law Libraries (AALL) strongly opposed the bill, arguing that the bill undermines citizens' right to be informed by making it more difficult for citizens to find their government's regulations. According to AALL, a survey they conducted \\"revealed that members of the public, librarians, researchers, students, attorneys, and small business owners continue to rely on the print\\" version of the Federal Register. AALL also argued that the lack of print versions of the Federal Register and CFR would mean the 15 percent of Americans who don't use the internet would lose their access to that material. The House voted on July 14, 2014 to pass the bill 386‚Äì0.

The YTM is often given in terms of Annual Percentage Rate (A.P.R.), but more often market convention is followed. In a number of major markets (such as gilts) the convention is to quote annualized yields with semi-annual compounding (see compound interest); thus, for example, an annual effective yield of 10.25% would be quoted as 10.00%, because 1.05 √ó 1.05 = 1.1025 and 2 √ó 5 = 10.Formulae for Calculating Gilt Prices from Yields Main assumptions The main underlying assumptions used concerning the traditional yield measures are: * The bond is held to maturity. * All coupon and principal payments are made on schedule. * The yield to maturity is the single interest rate that equates the present value of a bond's cash flows to its price.Fabozzi, Frank. The Handbook of Fixed Income Securities. McGraw-Hill, 2012, p. 746. The coupons received must be reinvested into an investment that earns the same rate as the yield to maturity.The risk that the yield to maturity will not be achieved due to not being able to reinvest the coupons at the YTM rate is known as reinvestment risk. Reinvestment risk is proportional to the time to maturity of the debt instrument as well as the size of the interim coupons received. Some literature however, such as the paper Yield-to-Maturity and the Reinvestment of Coupon Payments claims that making the reinvestment assumption is a common mistake in financial literature and coupon reinvestment is not required for YTM formula to hold. * The yield is usually quoted without making any allowance for tax paid by the investor on the return, and is then known as \\"gross redemption yield\\". It also does not make any allowance for the dealing costs incurred by the purchaser (or seller). Coupon rate vs. YTM and parity * If a bond's coupon rate is less than its YTM, then the bond is selling at a discount. * If a bond's coupon rate is more than its YTM, then the bond is selling at a premium. * If a bond's coupon rate is equal to its YTM, then the bond is selling at par. Variants of yield to maturity As some bonds have different characteristics, there are some variants of YTM: * Yield to call (YTC): when a bond is callable (can be repurchased by the issuer before the maturity), the market looks also to the Yield to call, which is the same calculation of the YTM, but assumes that the bond will be called, so the cashflow is shortened. * Yield to put (YTP): same as yield to call, but when the bond holder has the option to sell the bond back to the issuer at a fixed price on specified date. * Yield to worst (YTW): when a bond is callable, puttable, exchangeable, or has other features, the yield to worst is the lowest yield of yield to maturity, yield to call, yield to put, and others. Consequences When the YTM is less than the (expected) yield of another investment, one might be tempted to swap the investments. Care should be taken to subtract any transaction costs, or taxes. Calculations=Formula for yield to maturity for zero-coupon bonds \\\\text{Yield to maturity(YTM)} = \\\\sqrt[\\\\text{Time period}]{\\\\dfrac{\\\\text{Face value}}{\\\\text{Present value}}} - 1 =Example 1= Consider a 30-year zero-coupon bond with a face value of $100. If the bond is priced at an annual YTM of 10%, it will cost $5.73 today (the present value of this cash flow, 100/(1.1)30 = 5.73). Over the coming 30 years, the price will advance to $100, and the annualized return will be 10%. What happens in the meantime? Suppose that over the first 10 years of the holding period, interest rates decline, and the yield-to-maturity on the bond falls to 7%. With 20 years remaining to maturity, the price of the bond will be 100/1.0720, or $25.84. Even though the yield-to-maturity for the remaining life of the bond is just 7%, and the yield-to-maturity bargained for when the bond was purchased was only 10%, the return earned over the first 10 years is 16.25%. This can be found by evaluating (1+i) from the equation (1+i)10 = (25.882/5.7389), giving 0.1625. Over the remaining 20 years of the bond, the annual rate earned is not 16.25%, but rather 7%. This can be found by evaluating (1+i) from the equation (1+i)20 = 100/25.84, giving 1.07. Over the entire 30 year holding period, the original $5.73 invested increased to $100, so 10% per annum was earned, irrespective of any interest rate changes in between. =Example 2= An ABCXYZ Company bond that matures in one year, has a 5% yearly interest rate (coupon), and has a par value of $100. To sell to a new investor the bond must be priced for a current yield of 5.56%. The annual bond coupon should increase from $5 to $5.56 but the coupon can't change as only the bond price can change. So the bond is priced approximately at $100 - $0.56 or $99.44 . If the bond is held until maturity, the bond will pay $5 as interest and $100 par value for the matured bond. For the $99.44 investment, the bond investor will receive $105 and therefore the yield to maturity is 5.56 / 99.44 for 5.59% in the one year time period. Then continuing by trial and error, a bond gain of 5.53 divided by a bond price of 99.47 produces a yield to maturity of 5.56%. Also, the bond gain and the bond price add up to 105. Finally, a one-year zero-coupon bond of $105 and with a yield to maturity of 5.56%, calculates at a price of 105 / 1.0556^1 or 99.47. Coupon-bearing Bonds For bonds with multiple coupons, it is not generally possible to solve for yield in terms of price algebraically. A numerical root-finding technique such as Newton's method must be used to approximate the yield, which renders the present value of future cash flows equal to the bond price. Varying coupon With varying coupons the general discounting rule should be applied. Subscriber Yield A term used in Japan, this is simply the Yield to Maturity at time of issue: in other words the Yield to Maturity enjoyed by the buyer (subscriber) in the primary market.

Two devastating plagues happened during his reign, one in 664 and the other in 682; he himself was a victim of the second. Little else is known of his reign. Though little is known about the historical Cadwaladr, he became a mythical redeemer figure in Welsh culture. He is a prominent character in the romantic stories of Geoffrey of Monmouth, where he is portrayed as the last in an ancient line to hold the title King of Britain. In Geoffrey's account, he does not die of plague. He renounces his throne in 688 to become a pilgrim, in response to a prophecy that his sacrifice of personal power will bring about a future victory of the Britons over the Anglo-Saxons. Geoffrey's story of Cadwaladr's prophecy and trip to Rome is believed to be an embellishment of the events in the life of C√¶dwalla of Wessex, whom Geoffrey mistakenly conflated with Cadwaladr. C√¶dwalla renounced his throne and travelled to Rome in 688. For later Welsh commentators, the myth \\"provided a messianic hope for the future deliverance of Britain from the dominion of the Saxons\\". It was also used by both the Yorkist and Lancastrian factions during the Wars of the Roses to claim that their candidate would fulfil the prophecy by restoring the authentic lineage stemming from Cadwaladr. The red dragon () has long been known as a Welsh symbol, appearing in the Mabinogion, the Historia Brittonum, and the stories of Geoffrey of Monmouth. Since the accession of Henry VII to the English throne, it has often been referred to as \\"The Red Dragon of Cadwaladr\\". The association with Cadwaladr is a traditional one, without a firm historical provenance. Historical record A general map of Gwynedd showing the cantrefi. Cadwaladr was the son of a famous father, Cadwallon ap Cadfan, and the successor to King Cadafael. His name appears in the pedigrees of the Jesus College MS. 20 ‚Äî he is in his descendant's pedigree, given as: ... Cynan tintaeth6y. M. Rodri mol6yna6c. M. Idwal I6rch. M. Kadwaladyr vendigeit. M. Katwalla6n. M. Kad6ga6n. M. Iago. M. Beli. M. Run hir. M. Maelg6n g6yned ..., and from there back to Cunedda. (as \\"Kadwaladyr vendigeit\\", or \\"Cadwaladr the Blessed\\"). Cadwaladr appears to have suffered a major military defeat at the hands of the West Saxons at Pinhoe near Exeter in 658. He is said to have been of a \\"peaceful and pious\\" temperament and to have patronised many churches. The church of Llangadwaldr in Anglesey identifies him as its founder.John Cannon, The Oxford Companion to British History, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1997, p.150. Cadwaladr's name appears as 'Catgualart' in a section of the Historia Brittonum, where it says he died of a dreadful mortality while he was king., in Chapter 64. The great plague of 664 is not noted in the Annales Cambriae, but Bede's description, Book III, Chapter XXVII makes clear its impact in both Britain and Ireland, where its occurrence is also noted in the Irish Annals. ‚Äî year 664, \\"Mortalitas magna in Hiberniam pervenit\\" The plague of 682 is not noted by Bede, but the Annales Cambriae note its occurrence in Britain and that Cadwaladr was one of its victims., Annales Cambriae, year 682, \\"Mortalitas magna fuit in brittannia. n qua catgualart filius catguolaum obiit.\\" Both the Annales Cambriae and the Irish Annals note the plague's impact in Ireland in 683,, Annales Cambriae, year 683, \\"Mortalitas in hibernia.\\" ‚Äî year 683, \\"Initium tertiae mortalitatis\\" as do other sources. The genealogies in Jesus College MS. 20 ‚Äî his pedigree is given as: ... Cynan tintaeth6y. M. Rodri mol6yna6c. M. Idwal I6rch. M. Kadwaladyr vendigeit. M. Katwalla6n. M. Kad6ga6n. M. Iago. M. Beli. M. Run hir. M. Maelg6n g6yned ..., and from there back to Cunedda.Genealogies from Jesus College MS 20, Gwynedd 1. and the Harleian genealogies, Pedigree of Ywain Son of Hywel, in the Preface of Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales ‚Äî his pedigree is given as: ... Rotri Map Mermin Map Ethil Merch Cinnan Map Rotri M. Tutgual M. Catgualart M. Catman M. Jacob ..., and from there back through Maelgwn Gwynedd to Cunedda and his ancestors.Harleian genealogy 1: Gwynedd 1 give Cadwaladr as the son of Cadwallon and the father of Idwal Iwrch. Idwal, who fathered the later king Rhodri Molwynog, may have been his successor. Early mythic significance Cadwaladr's name is invoked in a number of literary works such as in the Armes Prydein, an early 10th-century prophetic poem from the Book of Taliesin. While the poem's \\"Cadwaladr\\" is an emblematic figure, scholars have taken the view that the Cadwaladr of Armes Prydein refers to the historical son of Cadwallon, and that already at this stage he \\"played a messianic role\\" of some sort, but \\"its precise nature remains uncertain\\".Wright, Neil, \\"Geoffrey of Monmouth and Bede\\" in Arthurian Literature VI, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 1992, p.27-60. He is typically paired with Conan Meriadoc, the founder of British settlements in Brittany. Conan and Cadwaladr are identified as warriors who will return to restore British power. Armes Prydein states that \\"the British shall be without their kingdom for many years and remain weak, until Conan in his chariot arrive from Brittany, and that revered leader of the Welsh, Cadwaladr.\\" Another poem states \\"Spendour of Cadwaladr, shining and bright, defence of armies in desolate places. Truly he will come across the waves, the promise of prophecy in the beginning.\\" According to Elissa R. Henken, Cadwaladr was well established as a \\"prophesied deliverer\\" of the Britons before Geoffrey's version of his life altered its ending. This may be because he was seen as the man who would carry forward the achievement of his father Cadwallon, the last great war leader of the Britons: \\"it is quite likely that the father and son became confused in folk memory, a fusion enhanced by Cadwaladr, whose name is a compound meaning 'battle-leader', also having assumed his father's epithet Bendigaid (Blessed).\\"Elissa R. Henken, National Redeemer: Owain Glynd≈µr in Welsh Tradition, Cornell University Press, 1996, pp.29‚Äì32. Geoffrey of Monmouth Peniarth MS 23) of Brut y Brenhinedd, the Welsh translation of Geoffrey's Historia Regum Britanniae, dating from before the end of the 15th century Cadwaladr figures prominently in Geoffrey of Monmouth's romantic account of the Historia Regum Britanniae (). As such, the Cadwaladr of Geoffrey is a literary invention that used the name of a historical person to advance the plot of the story. In Book XII, Chapter XIV of the Historia, Cadwaladr is given as the last in a line of kings that began with Brutus of Troy. Chapters XV ‚Äì XVIII have him leaving a depopulated Britain for Brittany, where the British people have resettled. Britain itself has been almost emptied by plague; for eleven years the country was \\"completely abandoned by all the Britons\\" except for parts of Wales. Cadwaladr is received as a guest by Alan Hir, King of Brittany. Taking advantage of the depopulation, the Saxons invite more of their countrymen to join them as soon as the plague abates. From this point they become completely dominant in Britain, and the British come to be called the \\"Welsh\\". At the same time, in Brittany, Cadwaladr intends to return to take back the island, and asks Alan to provide him with an army. The Breton king agrees, but Cadwaladr hears a prophetic voice which tells him that he must sacrifice personal power for the sake of his people. If he renounces the throne, his sacrifice will eventually lead to the restoration of British control of the island in the future, as predicted by Merlin to Vortigern: \\"the Voice added that, as a reward for its faithfulness, the British people would occupy the island again at some time in the future, once the appointed moment should come\\".Nice, Jason A., \\"Being 'British' in Rome: The Welsh at the English College, 1578‚Äì1584\\", The Catholic Historical Review, Volume: 92, Issue: 1, January 2006, p.1 Cadwaladr is told that if he lives a penitent life he will become a saint. His bones will be hidden to protect them. When his sacred bones are found and returned to Britain, the Britons (Welsh and Bretons) will be restored to full possession of their homeland. Cadwaladr and Alan then consult the prophecies of Merlin, and rejoice that this prediction will be fulfilled in future. He then travels to Rome as a pilgrim, where he dies in 689 after meeting the pope. Thus Cadwaladr becomes a messianic figure who sacrifices himself to redeem his people and restore them to their promised homeland. Cadwaladr's penitence assures his sainthood. His son Ivor and his nephew Ynyr return to Britain with an army, but, as predicted, are not successful in restoring British control of the island. In another passage in the book a list of Merlin's prophesies contains the prediction: This seems to correspond to the pairing of Cadwaladr and Conan as restorers of Britain in Armes Pridyn. The merging of the Welsh and Breton peoples is linked to an alliance with \\"Alban\\" (which probably means Scotland: Alba). The occupation of the English will be at an end and Britain will be restored to its true identity as the territory of the descendants of Brutus of Troy. Cadwaladr and the Wars of the Roses Henry VII's coat of arms, incorporating the \\"Red Dragon of Cadwallader\\" During the Wars of the Roses the prophecies connected to Cadwaladr were used by various contenders as part of their claim to the throne. This was linked to the story of the struggle between the Red Dragon and the White Dragon, part of the myth of Merlin, interpreted as warring Celtic and Saxon peoples. Edward IV claimed to be restoring the authentic ancient lineage of Cadwaladr, thus fulfilling Merlin's prophecy of the victory of the red dragon. His chancellor gave a sermon asserting that \\"the British line, which perished with Cadwallader's exile in 689 was restored by the arrival of Edward the king prophesied by Merlin and others.\\"Hughes, Jonathan, \\"Politics and the occult at the Court of Edward IV\\", Princes and Princely Culture: 1450‚Äì1650, Brill, 2005, p.112-13. The Tudors also claimed descent from Cadwaladr to legitimize their authority over Britain as a whole. Owen Tudor claimed descent from Cadwaladr and used a red dragon badge. When Henry Tudor landed in Wales in 1485, he adopted the red dragon flag and claimed to be returning in fulfilment of the prophesies of Merlin as recorded by Geoffrey of Monmouth. After his victory at the Battle of Bosworth Field Henry was greeted at the gates of Worcester with a poem asserting, :Cadwallader's blood lineally descending, :Long hath be told of such a prince coming. :Wherefore friends, if that I shall not lie, :This same is the fulfiller of the prophesy.Dobin, Howard, Merlin's Disciples: Prophecy, Poetry, and Power in Renaissance England, Stanford University Press, 1990, p.51. The Welsh Dragon (Red Dragon) was thereafter referred to as the \\"Red Dragon of Cadwallader\\" and used as Henry's personal emblem. Tudor historian Thomas Gardiner created a genealogical roll that gave Henry's son, Henry VIII, a pedigree showing his descent from Cadwaladr, referred to as \\"the laste kynge of that blode from whome by trew and lynyall descensse\\" the Tudors descended.D.R. Woolf, \\"The power of the past: history, ritual and political authority in Tudor England\\", in Paul A. Fideler, Political Thought and the Tudor Commonwealth:Deep Structure, Discourse, and Disguise, New York, 1992, pp.21‚Äì22. Cadwaladr and C√¶dwalla Geoffrey's account of the pilgrimage of Cadwaladr is believed to derive from a confusion between Cadwaladr and his near-contemporary C√¶dwalla of Wessex (reigned 685 ‚Äì 688). He also conflates Cadwaladr's son Ivor with C√¶dwalla's successor Ine., in the footnote explanations. According to Bede C√¶dwalla, king of Wessex, renounced his throne and went to Rome in 688 to be baptised by the pope, dying soon afterwards. Ine took the throne in 689. The argument that Geoffrey confused Cadwaladr with C√¶dwalla acquired significance in the late 1570s. At that time, when St. Peter's in Rome was being rebuilt, the tombstone of Caedwalla was found, confirming Bede's story that he had died in Rome. Welshmen in Rome, seeking to validate Geoffrey, claimed that the tomb was that of Cadwaladr. This raised the prospect that his sacred bones could be returned to Britain in fulfilment of the prophecy. The English critics stated that Geoffrey had simply mixed up the two kings, and that Cadwaladr's pilgrimage was thus pure fiction. According to Jason Nice, the Welsh \\"attempt to 'prove' the legend of Cadwaladr in Rome belonged to a longstanding tradition that held that Wales' special relationship with Rome could reinforce Welsh identity and protect Welshmen from English aggression\\", a belief that was grounded in the supposed prophecy given to Cadwaladr. Raphael Holinshed summed up the English view in his 1577 Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland: Also traced to Geoffrey's fertile imagination are stories of Ivor ap Alan and Ynyr travelling from Brittany to Britain. The choice of names for Ivor and Ynyr in the stories may be a consequence of spurious additions to the Laws of Edward the Confessor, which inaccurately speak of good relations between Wessex and the Welsh in the reign of King Ine of Wessex (reigned 688 ‚Äì 726).

Family and education  Harris was born in North London, the son of geneticist Professor Harry Harris and Muriel Harris (n√©e Hargest), a teacher. He was educated at Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School, then a direct grant grammar school, which he attended on a local authority free place. He joined the Labour Party when he was sixteen and became Branch Secretary of the Highgate Ward Labour Party while still at school. Harris went to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he read Natural Sciences for two years before switching to Economics. Whilst at Cambridge, he continued to be active politically and, like many students, joined all three political clubs so that he could attend their meetings. He was Chair of the Cambridge Fabians and Chair of the Cambridge University Labour Club, before becoming President of the Cambridge Union. He holds an Honorary Doctorate from Middlesex University and was for a number of years a Visiting Professor at London South Bank University. Professional career After Cambridge, Harris joined the Economics Division of the Bank of England, where he specialised in public sector finance. He also spent a period as Assistant to Christopher Dow the eminent applied economist, who was then Executive Director of the Bank. His next job was as Deputy Director of the Electricity Consumers‚Äô Council, where he led the pricing policy and social policy sides of the Council's work. He was Deputy Chair of the National Fuel Policy Forum and a member of the Council of Management of Neighbourhood Energy Action. Harris then became Director of the Association of Community Health Councils for England and Wales, which was then the national statutory body representing the interests of the users of the National Health Service, from 1987 to 1998. He was a member of the Executive Committee of the Patients‚Äô Association and served on various Department of Health bodies, including Openness in the NHS Steering Group, the Mental Health Task Force Group, the NHS Charter Advisors Group, and the Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution. In 1998, Harris established Toby Harris Associates that provided strategic advice to a wide range of public and private sector organisations. At various times, these included Unisys, Lockheed Martin, Microsoft, Airwave Solutions, Sunrise Radio, the National Grid and Humana Europe. He was also for a number of years a Senior Advisor to KPMG, and a Senior Associate of the King's Fund, as well as being a Special Advisor to the Board of Transport for London. He acts as UK Coordinator for the Electric Infrastructure Security Council that brings together the energy industry, lifeline infrastructure providers, central and local government, the voluntary sector and academia to help mitigate the risks of and consequences of a major wide-area and long-duration failure of electricity supplies.  Political career  After university, Harris was National Chair of the Young Fabians and served on the Executive of the Fabian Society and again became active in the London Labour Party, as Chair of Hornsey Constituency Labour Party. He was elected to London Borough of Haringey Council, as its youngest member, in 1978 and remained a member for 24 years. For five years, he chaired the Council's Social Services Committee and was also Labour Group Chief Whip. From 1987 to 1999, he was Leader of the Council, having been elected during a turbulent period of the Council's history as its seventh Leader in seven and a half years. He had the task of stabilising the Council's finances and dealing with the multimillion-pound overspending under the Bernie Grant leadership. He also had to handle the restoration of Alexandra Palace and the debts incurred on it since Haringey had taken over its ownership from the Greater London Council in 1980. One of the criticisms during his leadership was the expenses he incurred. Over the course of one year, his expenses were more than ¬£24,000, including more than ¬£15,000 spent on taxis.[3] Although the District Auditor's investigation cleared him of any wrongdoing, it was critical of the flaws of the system, which meant that council members were never sent invoices for such expenses and so were not able to check the actual amount that the council was being charged.[4] In 1993, Labour Council Leaders in London elected Harris as Chair of the Association of London Authorities (ALA) and two years later he led the discussions which led to the merger of the ALA with the London Boroughs Association (which had previously comprised the Conservative and Liberal Democrat led Boroughs) to form the Association of London Government (now London Councils), which he then chaired until he stood down in 2000. Harris was also active in the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, whose Social Services Committee he chaired, leading the negotiations with central government on the introduction of Care in the Community and the Children Act. When the Local Government Association was formed in 1997, Harris chaired the Labour Group (until 2004).

He was the first chairman of the Metropolitan Police Authority Metropolitan Police Authority from 2000 to 2004, overseeing the introduction of police community support officers and neighbourhood policing.  Public appointments  After losing his seat on the London Assembly in 2004, the Home Secretary, David Blunkett, appointed him as the Home Secretary's representative on the Metropolitan Police Authority with responsibility for overseeing the work of the Metropolitan Police in countering terrorism and in security. Harris also chaired the Independent Advisory Group on Deaths in Custody that reports to the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office and the Department of Health from 2009 to 2015. He has also chaired National Trading Standards which delivers national and regional consumer protection enforcement since 2013 and the Independent Reference Group of the National Crime Agency since 2017. He is a former Board member of the London Ambulance Service and Transport for London. He was a member of the European Committee of the Regions from 1994 to 2002.  Parliamentary activities  Harris was appointed by Tony Blair as a life peer on 5 August 1998 as Baron Harris of Haringey, of Hornsey in the London Borough of Haringey taking his seat in October 1998 as a Labour member. He has been Chair of the Labour Peers‚ÄôGroup since 2012 (having been vice-chair from 2008 until 2012). In Parliament, he sits on the Joint Committee on the National Security Strategy and is Chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Policing. He was Chair of the House of Lords Committee on the Legacy of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and was also a member of the Lords‚Äô Committee on Personal Internet Security. Reviews and inquiry reports In 2014, the then Minister for Prisons asked Harris to lead an independent review into the self-inflicted deaths of 87 young people in prison. This was published the following year as the Harris Review: Changing Prisons, Saving Lives and was the most substantial review of penal policy for a generation whose publication was hailed as ‚Äúa watershed moment‚Äù by campaigners In 2016, Sadiq Khan as newly elected Mayor of London commissioned Harris to conduct an independent review into London's Preparedness to Respond to a Major Terrorist Incident. Most of the recommendations of his review were accepted, although not all had been implemented by the time of the terrorist attacks in London in the spring of 2017. Charitable activities Harris also chaired the Freedom Charity, which educates young people about forced marriage and intervenes to prevent girls being forced to marry against their will, from 2009 to 2014. Harris chaired the Wembley National Stadium Trust from 1995 until 2018. The Trust successfully led the bid for lottery funding to enable the national stadium to be rebuilt at Wembleyand once the new stadium had reopened distributes 1% of the Stadium's turnover to support community sports activities.

(former name: Encana Corporation) is a hydrocarbon exploration and production company organized in Delaware and headquartered in Denver, United States. Initially, it was founded and headquartered in Calgary, Canada. The company is ranked 1923rd on the Forbes Global 2000 and has been included on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. Before asset sales in 2013, the company was the largest natural gas producer in Canada. History Former logo (as Encana) When the Canadian Pacific Railway was formed, the government of Sir John A. Macdonald compensated it for assuming the risk of developing the railroad with the subsurface rights for a checkerboard pattern of most of Alberta and part of Saskatchewan. These rights were later spun off to the company's predecessors. In 1883, Canadian Pacific Railway drilled for water near Medicine Hat, Alberta and discovered natural gas. On July 3, 1958, Canadian Pacific created \\"Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas\\" to manage its oil and gas properties and its mineral rights. In 1971, Canadian Pacific Oil and Gas merged with \\"Central-Del Rio Oils\\", creating \\"Pan Canadian Petroleum Limited\\". In April 2002, PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd was spun out of Canadian Pacific Limited. It subsequently merged with Alberta Energy Corporation to form EnCana. Gwyn Morgan was named president and CEO. In October 2004, EnCana sold its UK unit, including a 43% stake in the Buzzard field (discovered in 2001 by a PanCanadian-led group), to Nexen Inc for $2.1bn US. https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/nexen-buys-encana- unit/article1143338/ In January 2007, the company sold its assets in Chad to China National Petroleum Corporation for $202.5 million. In May 2007, the company sold its assets in the delta of the Mackenzie River. In spring 2008, residents from Pavillion, Wyoming, approached the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) about changes in water quality from their domestic wells. Encana was the primary natural gas producer in the area. In 2009, the EPA announced that it had found hydrocarbon contaminants in residents' drinking water wells. The Bow, Encana and Cenovus' headquarters, was announced in 2006 and completed in 2013 In 2009, Encana completed the corporate spin- off of Cenovus Energy, which held its oil business, representing one-third of total production and reserves, and EnCana Corporation retaining its natural gas business. Investors favoured the split as it allowed the flexibility to choose between investing in oil, gas, or both. In November 2011, a potential buyer backed out of a $45 million deal to buy the company's gas field in Pavillion, Wyoming. In December 2011, the company sold the majority of its natural gas producing assets in the Barnett Shale. In February 2012, Mitsubishi paid approximately C$2.9 billion for a 40% interest in the Cutbank Ridge Partnership with Encana, which involves 409,000 net acres of Montney Formation natural gas lands in northeast British Columbia. The company also sold its midstream assets in the Cutbank Ridge to Veresen for C$920 million. In December 2012, Encana announced a US$2.1 billion joint venture with state- owned, Beijing-based PetroChina through which PetroChina received a 49.9% stake in Encana's Duvernay Formation acreage in Alberta. This was in line with the rules that \\"favor minority stakes over takeovers\\" since Prime Minister Stephen Harper's December 7, 2012 prohibition of purchases by state-owned enterprises seeking to invest in Canadian oil. At the end of 2012, Encana's staff had increased to 4,169 employees. Encana and Cenovus' headquarters, The Bow in Calgary, was completed in 2013, becoming the tallest building in Canada outside of Toronto. The project, owned by H&R; REIT, was announced as Encana's headquarters in 2006, prior to the Cenovus split. In November 2013, the company cut its dividend, announced layoffs of 20% of its employees, closure of its office in Plano, Texas, and plans to sell assets and to found a separate company for its mineral rights and royalty interests across southern Alberta. It planned to invest 75% of its 2014 capital budget into 5 projects: Projects in the Montney Formation and the Duvernay Formation in Alberta, the San Juan Basin in New Mexico, Louisiana's Tuscaloosa Marine Shale, and the Denver-Julesburg Basin (DJ Basin) in northeast Colorado, Wyoming, and Nebraska. In June 2014, the company sold its Bighorn assets in Alberta to Jupiter Resources for US$1.8 billion. In November 2014, the company acquired Athlon Energy for $7.1 billion. In May 2014, Jonah Energy LLC acquired the company's Jonah Field operations in Sublette County, Wyoming. In June 2014, the company acquired assets in the Eagle Ford Group from Freeport-McMoRan for $3.1 billion. In August 2015, the company sold its assets in the Haynesville Shale for $850 million to affiliates of GSO Capital Partners and GeoSouthern Energy. In December 2015, the company significantly cut its dividend and capital expenditures budget after a fall in energy prices. In July 2016, the company sold its assets in the Denver Basin for $900 million. In June 2017, the company sold its assets in the Piceance Basin for $735 million. In May 2018, the company permanently ceased production at Deep Panuke. The Deep Panuke project produced and processed natural gas 250 kilometers offshore southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The platform was sent for recycling in 2020. In December 2018, the company sold its assets in the San Juan Basin for $480 million. In February 2019, the company acquired Newfield Exploration. In October 2019, the company announced plans to move its operations from Canada to Denver, where its CEO lived, and change its name to Ovintiv. Of particular criticism was the removal of the \\"Cana\\" in EnCana, which was thought to symbolize the changing of headquarters from Calgary to Denver. Encana's departure \\"only intensified the gloom enveloping the Canadian energy industry after foreign companies sold more than US$30 billion\\". Youssef Youssef, a commerce professor at Humber College in Toronto, also takes this perspective, citing the difficulty in changing a brand as recognizable as this one \\"(Encana) was a solid brand and it had resonance within the Canadian oil industry, and everybody knows the company, so to change the brand, it takes a lot of steps.‚Äù On January 24, 2020, after receiving shareholder approval, the company completed the transfer of its corporate domicile from Canada to the United States. In June 2020, the company announced layoffs of 25% of its workforce. Operations In 2019, the company's average production was of natural gas and per day of petroleum, and per day of natural gas liquids. The company has a land position in Canada of 1.680 million net acres, of which about 1.112 million net acres are undeveloped. Its assets in Canada are in the Montney Formation, where it has a partnership with Mitsubishi to develop Cutbank Ridge, the Duvernay Formation, Wheatland County, Alberta, and the Horn River Formation. In the United States, the company holds approximately 1.077 million net acres of land, of which 207,000 net acres are undeveloped. It operates in the Eagle Ford Group, Permian Basin, Anadarko Basin, Arkoma Basin, Uinta Basin, and the Williston Basin. Lawsuits=Alleged collusion and bid rigging with Chesapeake Energy From 2008 through 2010, the company accumulated 250,000 net acres in the Collingwood-Utica Shale gas play in the Middle Ordovician Collingwood formation of the Michigan Basin at an average cost of $150/acre. In May 2012, the company paid about $185 an acre for oil and gas rights on 2,156 acres (873 hectares) at an auction by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, which was \\"88 percent less than the average paid two years ago in the area\\". In July 2012, Reuters reported about e-mails between the company and Chesapeake Energy, the second-largest natural gas producer in the U.S., to divide up Michigan counties state land leases to suppress land prices in an October 2010 auction. In 2013, a private landowner filed suit against the company and Chesapeake for bid rigging. Justice Department and Michigan authorities were investigating whether state or federal laws were violated; the Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also investigated. While the case was dropped by the DOJ, Michigan's Attorney General followed up on the accusations, and Encana ended up with a fine of $5 million, and Chesapeake paid $25 million into a victim-compensation fund. Failed lawsuit by adjacent property owners to prevent drilling In 2013, two property owners adjacent to a drilling unit filed suit against the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) and Encana for potential harm due to proximity. In October 2013, the judge of the Circuit Court of Ingham County issued an injunction against Encana starting to drill until an administrative hearing before DEQ's supervisor of wells had been completed, re part 12 of DEQ's rules for oil and gas operations. In May 2014, the supervisor of wells found with Encana, that the petitioners did \\"not have standing\\", because they did not own land within the drilling unit and dismissed the case. Alleged excessive water use for hydraulic fracturing In November 2013, Ecojustice, the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Committee filed a lawsuit against Encana Corporation and the British Columbia's Oil and Gas Commission for excessive water use from lakes and rivers for its hydraulic fracturing for shale gas, \\"granted by repeated short-term water permits, a violation of the provincial water act\\". Criticism=Pipeline explosions In Pouce Coupe British Columbia five explosions targeted Encana pipelines between October 2008 and January 2009; media reports indicate the pipeline may have been bombed by a disgruntled community member fearing the sour gas (containing hydrogen sulfide, which can be fatal if too much of it is inhaled) poses a danger to the community. Encana's hydraulic fracturing operations in the United States are portrayed in the 2010 documentary, Gasland, which alleges that hydraulic fracturing causes pollution of ground and surface water, air, and soil. Deep Panuke project Issues were raised for the Deep Panuke project offshore of Nova Scotia, when it was proposed in 2006 as a smaller version with increased ocean discharges and when Encana asked for a \\"streamlined regulatory process\\" without public hearings.

Absol are Pok√©mon that can predict natural disasters, and due to their attempts at warning humans of said disasters, have been erroneously labeled as doom-bringers. Since its introduction, the Absol species has been well received by critics and fans, with most of the praise being toward its design. Concept and characteristics Absol is a Dark-type Pok√©mon with a felid appearance. It is known as the \\"Disaster Pok√©mon\\" because it can predict natural disasters such as earthquakes and tidal waves with its sickle-like horn, and appears before such disasters happen. It lives in the rugged mountains, and only leaves to warn people of natural disasters with its innate ability to sense them through subtle changes in the environment. In fact, in universe it is disliked by most people as they believe that Absol causes the disasters, as it's always seen before them, trying to warn the humans. People often accuse Absol of causing the disasters themselves, resulting in its reputation as a doom-bringer. Absol has white fur with a dark blue face, tail, and a scythe-like growth on the right side of its head. Its design has been described as yin and yang-themed by Jeff Marchiafava of Game Informer and Siobhan Whitebread of WhatCulture. It was given a \\"Mega Evolution\\" in Pok√©mon X and Y, which sees the yin and yang- styled fur on its head become more evident, according to Marchiafava, while the fur around the back of its mane shoots upward and appears to look like a pair of wings. Appearances Absol first appeared in the 2002 video games Pok√©mon Ruby and Sapphire, and could be found on Route 120. It also appeared on Route 120 in Pok√©mon Emerald, released in 2004 (Japan), or 2005 (North America, Europe, and Australia). Absol appears in Route 213 in a swarm during Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl, or on the summit of Mount Coronet in Pok√©mon Platinum. Absol could be found in Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver using the Hoenn sound in many locations, including Dark Cave, Union Cave, Slowpoke Well, the Whirl Islands, Cliff Cave, Mount Mortar, Ice Path, Tohjo Falls, Victory Road, Diglett's Cave, Mount Moon, Rock Tunnel, the Seafoam Islands, Mount Silver, and Cerulean Cave. If you transfer an Absol in, it will be found in the mountain area of Pal Park. In Pok√©mon Black and White, Absol appears in the Giant Chasm, a place that disaster is said to fall upon those who enter. It also appears in Route 13. In the sequel, Pok√©mon Black 2 and White 2, it can be found in Route 13, Route 14, and Route 23's hidden grotto. In the dream world, it can be found in Rugged Mountain. Absol can be found in Pok√©mon X and Y on Route 8, or in a dark friend safari. Absol appears in Pok√©mon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire on Route 120. In Pok√©mon Sun and Moon on Mount Lanakila or in Tapu Village. In Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team and Red Rescue Team (2005), an Absol makes a short appearance in Frosty Forest. It also appears as an NPC in Pok√©Park Wii: Pikachu's Adventure. Outside the video game series, Absol appears in the sixth film based on Pok√©mon, Pok√©mon: Jirachi Wish Maker (2003). It acts as Jirachi's protector and has to help Ash Ketchum and his friends to get Jirachi to the place where it must return to be in safe on time. However, Butler, a magician who is trying to capture Jirachi, stopped it and after being released it got consumed by the fake Groudon. Absol appears as a major figure in a 2004 episode of Advanced Battle. In the episode titled \\"Absol-ute Disaster!\\", Ash arrives in a village where the people think Absol is causing disasters and wants to prove they are wrong. Absol also appears in the episodes \\"What I Did for Love\\" and \\"May, We Harley Drew'd Ya!\\" of Battle Frontier, and in \\"Mutiny in the Bounty!\\" of Diamond and Pearl. The Mega Evolution version of Absol first appeared on \\"The Strongest Mega Evolution: Act I\\" special of the XY series, and also appears in the 2014 film Pok√©mon the Movie: Diancie and the Cocoon of Destruction. Reception Absol received generally positive reception by fans and critics. Exploring its popularity, it has appeared in several Pok√©mon-related merchandise, including key chains and plush dolls of both its regular and Mega Evolution likeness. IGN editor \\"Pok√©mon of the Day Chick\\" called Absol the \\"neatest Pok√©mon design since Umbreon\\", while the site's staff stated \\"Absol looks really cool (not quite sure what it is exactly), but it's also one of the more interesting Pok√©mon, period\\" after it being voted as the 75th best Pok√©mon in a poll conducted by the site. Through an Official Nintendo Magazine pool, readers voted Absol the best third generation Pok√©mon. His ability to predict disasters and the fact he is mistaked as bringing doom is \\"downright creepy\\" in Becky Hollada and Josh Max of Nintendo World Report opinions, because \\"as we've seen in films like The Ring, something bad is coming is almost just as bad as the thing itself.\\" While also found Absol \\"just so creepy\\", Whitebread elected Absol's design as the seventh best of all time Pok√©mon in a 2013 article when she noted \\"Absol is designed to be creepy, and fits the brief perfectly.\\" Marchiafava deemed Absol \\"by far the best Pok√©mon I've seen in a long time\\". While criticized how the name \\"Mega Absol\\" sounds and the fact that Mega Evolutions were more like \\"Different Hairstyle Pok√©mon\\", Marchiafava said \\"Mega Absol is legitimately cooler than normal Absol, though.\\" Thomas East, writing for Official Nintendo Magazine, stated \\"You wouldn't have thought it could look any better than it already does\\", while GamesTM compared its appearance to the characters of Spyro the Dragon.

Annals of Hwarang or Generations of the Hwarang) was a historical record of the Hwarang (lit. flower boys) of the Silla kingdom in ancient Korea. It is said to have been written by Silla historian Kim Daemun ÈáëÂ§ßÂïè (fl. 704) in the reign of Seongdeok the Great (r. 702~737). The Hwarang segi survived to the time that Kim Busik ÈáëÂØåËªæ (1075‚Äì1151) compiled the Samguk sagi, but is believed to have been lost since the 13th century, because no reference to the Hwarang segi was made after reference to the text found in monk Gakhun's Ë¶∫Ë®ì Haedong goseung jeon Êµ∑Êù±È´òÂÉßÂÇ≥ (Lives of Eminent Korean Monks, ca. 1215). However, two handwritten manuscripts of a text titled Hwarang segi were suddenly made public in 1989. It had been owned by a man named Park Chang-hwa, who worked at the Japanese Imperial Household Library during the Japanese Colonial period. The manuscript was kept by his student, Kim Jong- jin, and Kim's wife, Kim Kyung-ja, made it public to the media in 1989. The 32-page excerpt was released at the time and when Hwarang Segi was unveiled, Park had already died. (1889~1962) The first manuscript, which was made public in 1989, is typically called the \\"extract\\" (balchwebon, Î∞úÏ∑åÎ≥∏, ÊãîËêÉÊú¨), and contains a preface and short accounts of the first fifteen pungwolju (ÌíçÏõîÏ£º, È¢®Êúà‰∏ª) or leaders of the hwarang. The second manuscript, which was revealed by Park Chang hwa's son in 1995, is usually called \\"the mother text\\" (mobon, Î™®Î≥∏Ôºå ÊØçÊú¨) and contains a 162-page manuscript. Because the first part of the manuscript was damaged and missing, it begins with a fragmented but fuller account of the fourth pungwolju, continues with more detailed accounts of the first fifteen pungwolju, and concludes after an account of the thirty-second and final pungweolju. Both manuscripts are in the handwriting of Bak Changhwa Êú¥ÊòåÂíå(1889‚Äì1962), who was skilled in literary Chinese and also worked for the Imperial Library in Tokyo during the Colonial period. The historical validity of these Hwarang Segi manuscripts is still in controversy among many scholars of early Korea and Korean studies. Most scholars think of this as a novel although some argue for its authenticity.Those arguing in favor of the manuscript include Young-hoon Rhee (Ïù¥ÏòÅÌõà), a professor of economics at Seoul National University. Those arguing against include Richard D. McBride II, published in the Autumn 2005 edition of Korea Journal: , who maintains that it was a leisure writing or fictional work composed by Bak Changhwa because he composed many other fictional writings. For those who argue for the authenticity of the manuscripts, the importance of Hwarang segi is that is one of the scarce historical works about Silla by a person of Silla himself, and it is free from Confucian dogma and morality. If the Hwarang segi manuscripts are authentic, later historians have based their understanding of Three Kingdoms era on Goryeo Dynasty sources like Samguk sagi and Samguk yusa. However, even if it turns out to be Park Chang-hwa's novel, its value as a historical source is likely to be recognized. For instance, Lee Do Heum from Hanyang University suggested that \\"Hwarang segi,\\" written by Bak Chang Hwa, could be a manuscript of the original \\"Hwarang segi,\\" or a reprint of the original manuscript in later years. The manuscript known as the Hwarang Segi extract is made of 16 parts; one for the introduction and the fifteen for the biographies of fifteen pungwolju leaders of the hwarang.

It consists of a thin sheet of metal, such as aluminium, copper, or duralumin, that is bonded to a thicker sheet of plywood, giving it strength and rigidity at a relatively low weight. Plymax was introduced during the 1920s, quickly spreading throughout Europe and the world by the 1930s. The material has been extensively used in the aviation industry; various military aircraft throughout the 1930s and 1940s made use of the material. Plymax was also adopted by the automotive industry, being used on the bodies of several cars, such as the 1931 Triumph Super 9 and the articulated body of the Trojan Tasker. It has also found use within the construction industry for various large fixtures, typically partitions and doors, as well as by furniture manufacturers for various home furnishings. History Plymax first emerged during the early 1920s, one of the first compositions was a copper-faced plywood, manufactured by Luterma. The term 'Plymax' was a registered trademark of Venesta, which introduced the material to the British market. During the 1930s, the material was being extensively used within the architectural and construction sectors, where items such as partitions, doors, cubicals, counters, and stalls were constructed and installed throughout large buildings such as schools, hospitals, offices, and factories. According to Venesta, the typical metals used in Plymax are steel and aluminium; however, alternatives have included copper, bronze, stainless steel and others. Key qualities of the material are its rigidity and relatively light weight. By itself, each metal sheet lacks stiffness, when paired to the plywood to become a composite, it becomes far more rigid, being similar in principle to that of a steel girder in that the vertical web contributes little to the overall strength in comparison to the flanges set at the top and bottom, but plays a critical role in the rigidity. Due to its high strength-to-weight ratio, the material attracted the attention of various aircraft manufacturers. One notable example of its use was on the Morane- Saulnier M.S.406, a Second World War-era fighter aircraft that was extensively used by the French Air Force. Various aircraft would adopt the material for portions of their design; in one case, the interior floor of the Handley Page Halifax was composed of Plymax. Plymax was reportedly once a popular material for furniture use, although its use has somewhat diminished following the arrival of new types of processed woods. During the 1990s, the Malaysian company Plymax Veneer was established to provide veneer lamination services to local furniture manufacturers.

Coerver, \\"Manuel Gonz√°lez\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 3, p. 83. was a Mexican military general and liberal politician who served as the 31st President of Mexico from 1880 to 1884. Before initiating his presidential career, Gonz√°lez played important roles in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War as a lieutenant, and later in the Reform War as general on the conservative side. In the French intervention in Mexico, Gonz√°lez fought for the Mexican Republic under the command of General Porfirio D√≠az. He supported D√≠az's attempts to gain the presidency of Mexico, which succeeded in 1876. He served as Mexican Secretary of War in the D√≠az administration from 1878 to 1879. D√≠az could not be re-elected to the presidency in 1880, since the basis of his coup against Sebasti√°n Lerdo de Tejada was the principle of no- reelection, so D√≠az worked for the election of his political client Gonz√°lez, who would be weak rival should D√≠az run again. His presidency from 1880 to 1884 is marked by a number of major diplomatic and domestic achievements,Coerver, \\"Manuel Gonz√°lez\\", p. 84. which historian Friedrich Katz considers to be no less than \\"the profound transformation\\" of Mexico.Friedrich Katz, \\"The Liberal Republic and the Porfiriato, 1867-1910\\" in Mexico Since Independence, Leslie Bethell, ed. New York: Cambridge University Press 1991, p. 73. Although the Gonz√°lez presidency has been considered corrupt, that assessment is colored by the difficult financial circumstances in 1884 and by D√≠az's campaign to discredit his successor, paving the way for his own re- election in 1884.Katz, \\"The Liberal Republic and the Porfiriato\\", p. 73. Early life and military career Gonz√°lez was born in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico. He began his military career in 1847, fighting the invaders from the United States in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War after they killed his father, a farmer. From 1853 to 1855, he fought with the Conservative forces supporting General Antonio L√≥pez de Santa Anna. At the time of the Plan de Ayutla in 1854, he was with Conservative General Leonardo M√°rquez in Oaxaca, fighting against Liberal general Porfirio D√≠az. In 1856, he was wounded at the Battle of Ocotl√°n (1856), fighting with rebels against President Ignacio Comonfort. In March 1859, he took part in an attack on Veracruz by Conservative General Miguel Miram√≥n, against the legal, Liberal government of President Benito Ju√°rez. In 1860, he took advantage of an amnesty for the Conservatives decreed by Congress and offered his services to the Liberals fighting against Maximilian of Habsburg and the invasion. Gonz√°lez served under the military command of Porfirio D√≠az. He participated in the defense of Battle of Puebla Puebla on 5 May 1862 against the French, where the Mexicans won a great and unexpected victory. He was wounded and taken prisoner, but escaped. In 1863, D√≠az made him chief of the Army of the center. He fought under D√≠az in the battles of Miahuatl√°n and La Carbonera, Oaxaca. Gonz√°lez was taken prisoner by the French a second time in 1865, but he was paroled and rejoined the Mexican army. In 1867, he participated in the sieges of Puebla (where he lost his right arm) and of Mexico City. On 7 September 1867, after Ju√°rez's forces had retaken the capital, Ju√°rez named him military commander of the Federal District and governor of the National Palace, serving from 1871 to 1873. He supported D√≠az in revolt under the Plan de la Noria (D√≠az's 1871 unsuccessful revolt against Ju√°rez) and the Plan of Tuxtepec (his successful 1876 revolt against then-President Sebasti√°n Lerdo de Tejada). Vicente Riva Palacio, liberal politician, intellectual, and military man, served in his government.http://www.lib.utexas.edu/taro/utlac/00031/lac-00031.html On 13 March 1877, he obtained the rank of general of division. D√≠az named him governor and military commander of Michoac√°n (1877‚Äì79) and secretary of war and the navy (28 April 1878 to 15 November 1879). Political career=As president of the Republic Full-length picture in military regalia, showing the loss in battle of his right arm. Porfirio D√≠az could not run for re- election in 1880, and chose his comrade-in-arms Gonz√°lez as the presidential candidate, who was duly elected. He served from 1 December 1880 to 30 November 1884, both proceeded and succeeded by Porfirio D√≠az. D√≠az was a minister in his government. Gonz√°lez had an ambitious agenda, much of which was a continuation of that of D√≠az, seeking economic development. D√≠az's principal policies were concessions to foreign interests (Europe and especially the U.S.), renewed relations with European powers, and internal peace.Katz, \\"The Liberal Republic and the Porfiriato,\\" p. 72. Following the long period of political instability since Mexican independence, peace could lay the groundwork for foreign investment and infrastructure development. A slogan for the era of Porfirio D√≠az was \\"order and progress,\\" which Gonz√°lez followed. Key changes in the Mexican legal code opened the way for foreign investment and exports from Mexico. In particular a new mining code (1884) eliminated the state's ownership to subsoil rights dating to the colonial era, giving full rights to owners of property to both surface and subsoil rights by legally acquiring land. It \\"proved to be a bonanza both to Mexican landowners and to foreign investors.\\" A new land law was also enacted which allowed the government to sell so-called \\"vacant lands\\" (tierras bald√≠as), initiating a new era of land accumulation in Mexico. Companies surveying public land were compensated with a third of the land deemed \\"public,\\" which encouraged more designations of that category and enrichment to private companies.Katz, \\"The Liberal State and the Porfiriato,\\" p. 72. The law also encouraged settlement, He established agricultural and industrial colonies of 1,500 Italians in the state of Puebla. Gonz√°lez boosted spending on the Mexican military by 400% and increased the number of soldiers by 90%; he transformed the rural military police established by Ju√°rez into a loyal force supporting the president.Robert M. Buffington and William E. French, \\"The Culture of Modernity\\" in The Oxford History of Mexico, Michael C. Meyer and William H. Beezley, eds. New York: Oxford University Press 405. The expanded armed forces and the will to take of northern national territory that Apache Indians de facto controlled saw their final defeat, thereby opening up a region for settlement and economic development.Katz, \\"The Liberal State and the Porfiriato,\\", p. 73. A dispute with Guatemala over Chiapas and Soconusco was resolved peacefully in Mexico's favor, securing much of its southern area. However, the rebellious Maya Indians in Yucatan, in a conflict known as the Caste War of Yucatan, continued under Gonz√°lez's presidency. Manuel Gonzalez, President of Mexico. Under Gonz√°lez, Mexico re-established relations with European powers (Britain, France, Germany), which was an important means to offset U.S. power in Mexico as well as gain access to European capital. Mexican relations with Great Britain were renewed, once Mexico recognized the long-standing British bond debt from the Conservative government. The considerable sum of ¬£11.5 million would be a drain on the empty national treasury, with the announcement coming during a financial downturn in Mexico. This concession provoked protests from the Mexican congress, and riots in the capital put down forcefully and brutally, damaging Gonz√°lez's reputation.Katz, \\"The Liberal State and the Porfiriato,\\" p. 73. Aiding in the economic expansion of Mexico was the founding of the Banco Nacional de M√©xico, with French bankers playing an important role.Katz, \\"The Liberal Republic and the Porfiriato,\\" p. 71. The preference for ties with Europe was reinforced with Mexico's adoption on 20 December 1882, of the metric system of measurements, created under French emperor Napoleon, rather than the British/U.S. measurements. During his administration, the railway from Mexico City to the border city of Paso del Norte (current Ciudad Ju√°rez) was constructed, a key factor in U.S. investment in Mexico and ending the deliberate policy of keeping the U.S. at bay through the obstacle of the northern desert. Lerdo had delayed the railway expansion northward, saying \\"Between weakness and strength the desert.\\" Along with the expansion of the railway network, Mexico inaugurated its first submarine cable. In 1882, he issued nickel coins, replacing silver coinage, which produced the inflation rate and prompted the devaluation of the currency, provoking riots on 21 December 1883. With his characteristic valor, he appeared before the rioters, actually receiving cheers before he finished speaking. During his term, the Constitution of 1857 was amended to remove the right of succession to the presidency from the office of president of the Supreme Court, which was how both Benito Ju√°rez and Sebasti√°n Lerdo de Tejada had come to the presidency. Instead, the president of the Senate was named next in succession, or the president of the Permanent Commission, in the event that the Senate was in recess. At the end of his full four-year term, he stepped down from presidency and was succeeded by Porfirio D√≠az, who had not been re-elected to consecutive terms as president, but following the Gonz√°lez interregnum, D√≠az would remain in power until ousted in 1911 with the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910. D√≠az's denigration of Gonz√°lez's achievements as president and the charges of corruption have led to his basic eclipse in Mexican history. His biographer Don M. Coerver's full scholarly study of his presidency is an exception.Don M. Coerver, The Porfirian Interregnum: The Presidency of Manuel Gonz√°lez of Mexico, 1880-1884. 1979. After the presidency After his term as president, Gonzalez was charged with misappropriation of public funds by the Congress in 1885 and the case was referred to a Grand Jury, but the charges were dropped three years later, on 30 October 1888. Rather than being punished by the legal system, Gonz√°lez was elected governor of Guanajuato \\"unanimously\\" in 1884 and served three terms in office until his death by pancreatic cancer in 1893,Don M. Coerver, \\"Manuel Gonz√°lez,\\" p. 84. He made a failed attempt to succeed President D√≠az in 1887. He was buried in the Rotonda de las Personas Ilustres (Rotunda of Illustrious People) on 8 May 1893. See also *List of heads of state of Mexico *Porfiriato ReferencesFurther reading *Coerver, Don M.

It is designed to seat 30-36 passengers and, as of July 2018, there were 240 operational aircraft used by 34 different operators. Under the production arrangement in which production was split 65:35 between Saab and Fairchild, Saab constructed the all-aluminium fuselage and vertical stabilizer along with final assembly of the aircraft in Link√∂ping, Sweden, while Fairchild was responsible for the wings, empennage, and wing-mounted nacelles for the two turboprop engines. After Fairchild ceased this work in 1985, production of these components was transferred to Sweden. On 25 January 1983, the Saab 340 conducted its maiden flight. During the early 1990s, an enlarged derivative of the airliner, designated as the Saab 2000, was introduced. However, sales of the type declined due to intense competition within the regional aircraft market. In 1998, Saab decided to terminate production of the Saab 340. Development 2+1 passenger cross-section Origins During the 1970s, Swedish aircraft manufacturer Saab AB became increasingly interested in the civil aircraft market.Eliasson 2010, pp. 88‚Äì89. In 1974, the company decided to proceed with developing its first major civilian aircraft, having previously focused almost entirely upon military aircraft. During the late 1970s, internal studies had determined that a short-haul airliner should be optimised to seat around 30 passengers.Eliasson 2010, pp. 80‚Äì81, 88. Likewise, it was decided that to make use of turboprop propulsion, which was slower but more economical than turbofan engines, and to optimise the airliner to take advantage of this type of powerplant; this decision may have been influenced by high oil prices during that decade, such as the 1973 oil crisis. According to author Gunnar Eliasson, the selection of a turboprop engine made the type less attractive to airlines than jet-powered competitors, however recognised that the General Electric CT7-5A2 engine picked was quite competitive with the jet engines of that era. As conceived, the airliner was to match the performance of jets within its short-haul role.Eriksson, S√∂ren and Harm-Jan Steenhuis. The Global Commercial Aviation Industry. Routledge, 2015. . p. 51-53 Towards the end of the 1970s, the regional airliner venture had become the largest industrial venture in Sweden and was recognised as being too large for Saab to conduct alone.Eliasson 2010, p. 89. Accordingly, in January 1980, it was announced that Saab had entered into a partnership arrangement with US manufacturer Fairchild Aircraft to develop and produce the upcoming regional airliner. Under this partnership, Fairchild became responsible for the manufacture of sections such as the wings, tail unit, and engine nacelles while Saab was responsible for 75 per cent of the costs of development, system integration and certification. To match the new partnership, the type received the designation of SF340. The decision to develop a new generation regional airliner had fortuitously coincided with the removal of control by the US federal government under the 1978 Airline Deregulation Act, an event which would notably contribute to sales of the type during the following decade. The 340 shared several manufacturing and design techniques that were used in Saab's military aircraft, such as the then in-development Saab JAS 39 Gripen multirole combat aircraft. One such technique was eliminating the use of rivets on the aluminium structures, using diffusion bonding instead, to reduce weight.Eliasson 2010, pp. 89‚Äì90. On 25 January 1983, the first SF340 performed its maiden flight. Shortly following its launch onto the market in 1984, the Saab 340 became the best selling commuter aircraft in the world.Eliasson 2010, p. 68. By 1987, all activity by Fairchild on the programme had ceased, the US company having chosen to curtail its aircraft activities, thus Saab became solely responsible for producing the 340. Further development Planform view showing straight wing In 1985, due to Fairchild's decision to exit the aircraft manufacturing business following the completion of the first 40 units, Saab dropped the Fairchild name from the project and proceeded to continue aircraft production, referring to the type under the designation Saab 340A. A total of 159 A models were manufactured. In 1989, an improved version of the airliner, the second generation 340B, introduced more powerful engines and wider horizontal stabilizers; later production 340Bs also featured an active noise control system. A total of 200 aircraft were built. In 1994, the final third generation version, the 340B Plus, was delivered for service and incorporated improvements that were being introduced at the same time upon the larger Saab 2000, itself a derivative of the 340. A total of 100 aircraft were completed, adding up to a total of 300 B models. The Saab 340 typically seated between 30 and 36 passengers, with 34 seats being the most common configuration. The last two 340s built were constructed as older configuration 36-seat aircraft for Japan Air Commuter. One of the major improvements introduced in the 340B Plus was the installation of an active noise and vibration control system in the cabin, reducing noise and vibration levels by about ten dB during cruising flight. This optional feature carried over from the 340B was standard in the 340B Plus along with extended wingtips which was an option on the 340B, about 30 aircraft having the WT option.Halvorsen W. and Emborg U., \\"Interior Noise Control of the Saab 340.\\" SAE Technical Paper 891080, 1989. Another change from earlier models was a more modern interior design and the moving of the lavatory compartment from the aft of the passenger cabin to just aft of the flight deck in most 3rd generation units. This increased total available cargo volume as the original location intruded into the cargo bin area. While the active noise control became standard on all Saab 340Bs in 1994 the first-ever 340B Plus (third B+ built) was delivered new to Hazelton Airlines in Australia in 1995, later operating for Regional Express, and currently for the Japanese Coast Guard. The system could also be retrofitted onto existing airliners.\\"Quiet cabin retrofit for Saab 340s.\\" Flight International, 9 September 1998. During 1997, Saab was releasing pessimistic press releases on the 340 programme, stating that it was considering the potential closure of production line, but also pledged that it would maintain full support to existing customers if this happened.\\"Saab out but Fokker in?\\" Flight International, 1 December 1997.Martin, Mike. \\"Saab pledges not to let customers down.\\" Flight International, 18 November 1997. On 24 December 1997, Saab announced that it had come to the decision to terminate production of the 340, which it claimed had lost SKr3 billion ($386.4 million) in the previous three years.Jeziorsk, Andrzej. \\"Saab decides to terminate turboprop products.\\" Flight International, 24 December 1997. By late 1998, as production was being slowed down towards an eventual shut down, Saab stated that it had been holding talks with a number of interested parties, reportedly including Indian and Chinese companies, on the potential sale of the 340 production line to another manufacturer.Kingsley-Jones, Max. \\"Saab winds down turboprop production as talks continue.\\" Flight International, 16 September 1998. On 8 June 1999, the final 340 was delivered, by which time nearly 460 aircraft had been delivered. Production of all models of the 340 was terminated in 1999, and Saab ultimately decided to cease all civil aircraft production in 2005. According to Eliasson, the decision to power the type using turboprop engines rather that jet engines had been provided as one of the reasons for Saab deciding to close down the project; another major factor had been the increasingly competitive and politicised regional airliner market in which various competing airlines were alleged to have substantially benefited from government subsidies, while the Swedish government were unwilling to make such commitments to Saab's civil projects.Eliasson 2010, pp. 89, 264. According to authors S√∂ren Eriksson and Harm-Jan Steenhuis, while the 340 had been faster than jet-powered competitors such as the Fokker 100 and British Aerospace 146, it had no clear advantage in terms of payload or range; as the regional airliner market became increasingly crowded, newer types such as the Bombardier CRJ200 and Embraer ERJ 145 family, which did have an advantage over the 340, had led to diminished sales.  Derivatives  Saab 340 AEW&C; with Erieye radar During the early 1980s, Sweden's Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) requested that Ericsson, a Swedish electronics company, develop a suitable radar for an airborne early warning (AEW) system.Eliasson 2010, p. 132. The corresponding system was soon paired with the 340 as a platform. Several military variants of the type were produced, including the Saab 340 AEW&C;, 340AEW-200 & 340AEW-300, which are AEW and airborne early warning & control (AEW&C;) aircraft. During the 2010s, Saab promoted the 340 in the maritime patrol mission. A specialised variant of the aircraft, designated as the 340 MSA, was mooted; the proposed patrol aircraft is to be equipped with various sensors and combat systems to be capable of performing both anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare, as well as signals intelligence and long range search and rescue operations.Taylor, Ellis. \\"FARNBOROUGH: Saab waiting for UK maritime patrol details.\\" Flight International, 17 July 2014. In June 2014, Anders Dahl, head of Saab Singapore, gave a presentation on the 340MSA, and observed that several nations were in talks with Saab on the type, as well as there being increasing demand for such maritime patrol aircraft in Southeast Asia.Waldron, Greg. \\"Saab makes Southeast Asia maritime surveillance push.\\" Flight International, 5 June 2014. Operational history On 6 June 1984, the Saab 340's launch customer, Swiss operator Crossair, received its first 340 aircraft. One week later, the type performed its first flight with paying customers on board; passengers on board this flight included Pope John Paul II. During 1989, US regional airline American Eagle placed a large order for the type, procuring a total of 50 340Bs along with options for an additional 50 aircraft.\\"Regional Airlines: Green Lights, Big Orders.\\" Flying Magazine, August 1989. Vol. 116, No. 8. ISSN 0015-4806. p. 16. However, business conditions and demand for turboprop-powered regional airliner transformed dramatically during the 1990s; this can be perhaps best summarised by AMR Eagle's decision in October 1999 to announce its intention to phase out its 340 fleet.\\"American Eagle starts phasing out Saabs.\\" Flight International, 20 October 1999. Faced with diminished value and demand for the 340, Saab chose to shutter production in 1999. While production of the type ceased in 1999, Saab continued to develop and heavily market the 340 for various purposes in both the civil and military markets. In July 2001, the company announced that it had launched a new partnership with service provider Piedmont Hawthorne to remarket used regional 340s to corporate customers.\\"Saab starts new venture to meet corporate demand.\\" Flight International, 24 July 2001. In April 2002, it was announced that Canadian company Field Aviation had been contracted by Saab to produce a freighter version of the 340, initially focusing on conversions of the earlier 340A model.Lewis, Paul. \\"Field Aviation starts work on first Saab 340 freighter.\\" Flight International, 30 April 2002.Sobie, Brendan. \\"Saab 340 promoted for FedEx regional freighter requirement.\\" Flight International, 15 October 2002. Even after production was terminated, a large number of 340s have remained in commercial service in the following decades. By 2006, there was a resurgence in demand for turboprop- powered airliners, in part due to the rising price of oil;Endres, G√ºnter. \\"Back to stay: the regional aircraft market.\\" Flight International, 31 October 2006.\\"Turboprops are back.\\" Flight International, 28 June 2005. during this year, Saab announced the largest ever leasing deal for the 340, providing a total of 25 340s to Australian operator Regional Express Airlines.Learmount, David. \\"Turboprops resurgent in European market.\\" Flight International, 3 October 2006. By late 2010, Saab was evaluating the option of extending the certified lifespan of the 340 which, under the Maintenance Review Board programme, is typically limited to 60,000 hours; the company believes the maintenance programme could be extended to accommodate up to a 75,000 hour limit.Bonnassies, Olivier. \\"Saab considers 340 cycle programme extension.\\" Flight International, 6 October 2010. The existing aircraft have remained relatively active and competitive into the following decade. In late 2008, following a merger between US carriers Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines, the latter announced that a new Saab 340 base was being formed in Atlanta, after which the merged airline would replace its inventory of 12 ATR 72s in its regional fleet with 49 former Northwest 340s.Sobie, Brendan. \\"Delta plans to open Saab 340 base at Atlanta hub.\\" Flight International, 13 October 2008. During early 2009, Russian operator Polet Airlines conducted talks with American Eagle to lease 25 340s to increase its breadth of regional flights.Zaitsev, Tom. \\"Russia's Polet in talks to lease 25 Saab 340s.\\" Flight International, 8 April 2009.

Can be fitted with an auxiliary fuel tank for extended operation. A stretched, and significantly faster, derivative of the aircraft, designated as the Saab 2000, was also developed and produced during the 1990s. Operators As of July 2018, there were 210 Saab 340s in service with 34 operators around the world. Primary operators include Regional Express with 52 aircraft, Silver Airways with 21, Loganair with 16, PenAir with 13, SprintAir with 12, and others with fewer aircraft of the type. In December 2016, the fleet average is at 35,277 h and 39,446 cycles ‚Äì a mean 0.89h per flight, less than halfway of its remaining life : the airframe life has been extended from 45,000 to 80,000 flight hours and 90,000 cycles and the Saab 340 should remain in service for another 30 years. Fleet leaders are at 71,268 cycles and 61,867h. Accidents and incidents Between 1983 and 2013, there were 13 hull-loss accidents involving the Saab 340 series aircraft, resulting in the deaths of 48 people. Accidents with fatalities * 4 April 1994: KLM Cityhopper Flight 433 stalled and struck the ground while returning to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The pilots falsely believed there was a problem with one of their engines. The aircraft broke apart on impact. Three people were killed. * 19 March 1998: Formosa Airlines 340B crashed into the ocean 11 km off the city of Hsinchu in Taiwan, caused by electrical fault and disorientation of crew. 13 people killed. * 10 January 2000: After taking off from Z√ºrich Airport, Crossair Flight 498 banked steeply and entered a high-speed spiral dive, crashing into a field in Niederhasli. All ten people on board were killed. * 18 May 2011: Sol L√≠neas A√©reas Flight 5428 en route from Neuqu√©n to Comodoro Rivadavia, a Saab 340A (LV-CEJ), crashed in Prahuaniyeu, Rio Negro Province, Argentina, causing 22 fatalities.\\"Passenger plane crashes in Argentina: local TV .\\" Reuters. May 19, 2011. Retrieved on May 19, 2011. Hull losses * 21 February 1990: The undercarriage was accidentally retracted on a Crossair Saab 340A, on the apron at Z√ºrich Airport. No fatalities, aircraft destroyed. The captain involved was killed in a subsequent crash in 2001. * 2 January 1993: Express Airlines Saab 340A crashed hard onto the runway at Chisholm-Hibbing Municipal Airport due to wing ice accretion. No fatalities, aircraft destroyed. * 14 May 1997: Pilots of Regional L√≠neas A√©reas 340B landing at Francisco de S√° Carneiro Airport were not aware of runway construction work.

No fatalities. * 6 September 2001: Aerolitoral Airlines 340B made an emergency belly landing in farmland after running out of fuel near the Las Palmas River, in Mexico. No fatalities. Aircraft written off and scrapped. * 8 June 2005: Shuttle America 340A, operating as United Express Airlines reported undercarriage problems on approach to Washington Dulles International Airport. Undercarriage collapsed on landing, aircraft skidded off the runway, and onto grass. No fatalities, aircraft damaged beyond repair. * 13 June 2013: SkyBahamas Airlines Flight 9561 from Fort Lauderdale to Marsh Harbour attempted to land on Marsh Harbour's runway 09 but touched down hard, bounced four times until the right wing detached, and veered right, off the runway. The Saab SF-340B came to a stop with the right wing fractured and right main gear collapsed. There were no injuries, but the aircraft incurred substantial damage. Other incidents * 21 November 1991: Comair Saab 340A (N146CA), with three crew and 26 passengers on a flight from Cincinnati to Toronto, the propeller from the right side engine detached near Buffalo, New York, after the engine was shut down due to vibrations. The aircraft landed safely on a single engine. The cause of the failure was found to be fatigue of the shaft due to the melting process of the ingot. * 17 March 2017: A Regional Express Airlines (Rex) Saab 340B (VH-NRX), flight ZL768 carrying 16 passengers and 3 crew from Albury to Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, made a safe emergency landing without injuries at Sydney after losing a propeller 19 km before. Rex announced on 20 March 2017 that it would ground a further five aircraft and quarantine the same series of propeller gear boxes and shafts for inspection as a precautionary measure. The propeller was located on 21 March 2017 in bushland near the Sydney suburb of Revesby by New South Wales Police Force airwing.

It is separated from the parietal lobe by a groove between tissues called the central sulcus and from the temporal lobe by a deeper groove called the lateral sulcus (Sylvian fissure). The most anterior rounded part of the frontal lobe (though not well-defined) is known as the frontal pole, one of the three poles of the cerebrum. The frontal lobe is covered by the frontal cortex. The frontal cortex includes the premotor cortex, and the primary motor cortex ‚Äì cortical parts of the motor cortex. The front part of the frontal lobe is covered by the prefrontal cortex. There are four principal gyri in the frontal lobe. The precentral gyrus, is directly anterior to the central sulcus, running parallel to it and contains the primary motor cortex, which controls voluntary movements of specific body parts. Three horizontally arranged subsections of the frontal gyrus are the superior frontal gyrus, the middle frontal gyrus, and the inferior frontal gyrus. The inferior frontal gyrus is divided into three parts ‚Äì the orbital part, the triangular part, and the opercular part. The frontal lobe contains most of the dopamine neurons in the cerebral cortex. The dopaminergic pathways are associated with reward, attention, short-term memory tasks, planning, and motivation. Dopamine tends to limit and select sensory information arriving from the thalamus to the forebrain.  Structure  Animation. Frontal lobe (red) of left cerebral hemisphere. The frontal lobe is the largest lobe of the brain and makes up about a third of the surface area of each hemisphere. On the lateral surface of each hemisphere, the central sulcus separates the frontal lobe from the parietal lobe. The lateral sulcus separates the frontal lobe from the temporal lobe. The frontal lobe can be divided into a lateral, polar, orbital (above the orbit; also called basal or ventral), and medial part. Each of these parts consists of a particular gyrus: * Lateral part: lateral part of the superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus * Polar part: Transverse frontopolar gyri, frontomarginal gyrus. * Orbital part: Lateral orbital gyrus, anterior orbital gyrus, posterior orbital gyrus, medial orbital gyrus, and gyrus rectus * Medial part: Medial part of the superior frontal gyrus, cingulate gyrus. The gyri are separated by sulci. E.g., the precentral gyrus is in front of the central sulcus, and behind the precentral sulcus. The superior and middle frontal gyri are divided by the superior frontal sulcus. The middle and inferior frontal gyri are divided by the inferior frontal sulcus. In humans, the frontal lobe reaches full maturity around the late 20s, marking the cognitive maturity associated with adulthood. A small amount of atrophy, however, is normal in the aging person‚Äôs frontal lobe. Fjell, in 2009, studied atrophy of the brain in people aged 60‚Äì91 years. The 142 healthy participants were scanned using MRI. Their results were compared to those of 122 participants with Alzheimer's disease. A follow-up one year later showed there to have been a marked volumetric decline in those with Alzheimer's and a much smaller decline (averaging 0.5%) in the healthy group. These findings corroborate those of Coffey, who in 1992 indicated that the frontal lobe decreases in volume approximately 0.5%‚Äì1% per year.  Function  The entirety of the frontal cortex can be considered the \\"action cortex\\", much as the posterior cortex is considered the ‚Äúsensory cortex\\". It is devoted to action of one kind or another: skeletal movement, ocular movement, speech control, the expression of emotions, etc. In humans, the largest part of the frontal cortex, i.e. the Prefrontal cortex, is responsible for internal, purposeful mental action, commonly called reasoning or Prefrontal Synthesis. The function of the PFC involves the ability to project future consequences that result from current actions. PFC functions also include override and suppression of socially unacceptable responses as well as differentiation of tasks. The PFC also plays an important part in integrating longer non-task based memories stored across the brain. These are often memories associated with emotions derived from input from the brain's limbic system. The frontal lobe modifies those emotions, generally to fit socially acceptable norms. Psychological tests that measure frontal lobe function include finger tapping (as the frontal lobe controls voluntary movement), the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, and measures of language, numeracy skills and decision making which are all controlled by frontal lobe. Clinical significance=Damage Damage to the frontal lobe can occur in a number of ways and result in many different consequences. Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) also known as mini-strokes, and strokes are common causes of frontal lobe damage in older adults (65 and over). These strokes and mini- strokes can occur due to the blockage of blood flow to the brain or as a result of the rupturing of an aneurysm in a cerebral artery. Other ways in which injury can occur include head injuries such as traumatic brain injuries incurred following accidents, diagnoses such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease (which cause dementia symptoms), and frontal lobe epilepsy (which can occur at any age). =Symptoms= Common effects of damage to the frontal lobe are varied. Patients who have experienced frontal lobe trauma may know the appropriate response to a situation but display inappropriate responses to those same situations in \\"real life\\". Similarly, emotions that are felt may not be expressed in the face or voice. For example, someone who is feeling happy would not smile, and the voice would be devoid of emotion. Along the same lines, though, the person may also exhibit excessive, unwarranted displays of emotion. Depression is common in stroke patients. Also common is a loss of or decrease in motivation. Someone might not want to carry out normal daily activities and would not feel \\"up to it\\". Those who are close to the person who has experienced the damage may notice changes in behavior. This personality change is characteristic of damage to the frontal lobe and was exemplified in the case of Phineas Gage. The frontal lobe is the same part of the brain that is responsible for executive functions such as planning for the future, judgment, decision-making skills, attention span, and inhibition. These functions can decrease drastically in someone whose frontal lobe is damaged. Consequences that are seen less frequently are also varied. Confabulation may be the most frequently indicated \\"less common\\" effect. In the case of confabulation, someone gives false information while maintaining the belief that it is the truth. In a small number of patients, uncharacteristic cheerfulness can be noted. This effect is seen mostly in patients with lesions to the right frontal portion of the brain. Another infrequent effect is that of reduplicative paramnesia, in which patients believe that the location in which they currently reside is a replica of one located somewhere else. Similarly, those who experience Capgras syndrome after frontal lobe damage believe that an identical \\"replacement\\" has taken the identity of a close friend, relative, or other person and is posing as that person. This last effect is seen mostly in schizophrenic patients who also have a neurological disorder in the frontal lobe. =DNA damage= In the human frontal cortex, a set of genes undergo reduced expression after age 40 and especially after age 70. This set includes genes that have key functions in synaptic plasticity important in learning and memory, vesicular transport and mitochondrial function. During aging, DNA damage is markedly increased in the promoters of the genes displaying reduced expression in the frontal cortex. In cultured human neurons, these promoters are selectively damaged by oxidative stress. Individuals with HIV associated neurocognitive disorders accumulate nuclear and mitochondrial DNA damage in the frontal cortex. Genetic A report from the National Institute of Mental Health says a gene variant of (COMT) that reduces dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex is related to poorer performance and inefficient functioning of that brain region during working memory, tasks, and to a slightly increased risk for schizophrenia. History= Psychosurgery  In the early 20th century, a medical treatment for mental illness, first developed by Portuguese neurologist Egas Moniz, involved damaging the pathways connecting the frontal lobe to the limbic system. A frontal lobotomy (sometimes called frontal leucotomy) successfully reduced distress but at the cost of often blunting the subject's emotions, volition and personality. The indiscriminate use of this psychosurgical procedure, combined with its severe side effects and a mortality rate of 7.4 to 17 per cent, gained it a bad reputation. The frontal lobotomy has largely died out as a psychiatric treatment. More precise psychosurgical procedures are still used, although rarely. They may include anterior capsulotomy (bilateral thermal lesions of the anterior limbs of the internal capsule) or the bilateral cingulotomy (involving lesions of the anterior cingulate gyri) and might be used to treat otherwise untreatable obsessional disorders or clinical depression.  Theories of function  Theories of frontal lobe function can be separated into four categories: * Single-process theories, which propose that \\"damage to a single process or system is responsible for a number of different dysexecutive symptoms‚Äù (Burgess, 2003, p. 309). * Multi-process theories, which propose \\"that the frontal lobe executive system consists of a number of components that typically work together in everyday actions (heterogeneity of function)\\" (Burgess, 2003, p. 310). * Construct-led theories, which propose that \\"most if not all frontal functions can be explained by one construct (homogeneity of function) such as working memory or inhibition\\" (Stuss, 1999, p. 348; cf. Burgess & Simons, 2005). * Single-symptom theories, which propose that a specific dysexecutive symptom (e.g., confabulation) is related to the processes and construct of the underlying structures.(cf. Burgess & Simons, 2005). Other theories include: * Stuss (1999) suggests a differentiation into two categories according to homogeneity and heterogeneity of function. * Grafman's managerial knowledge units (MKU) / structured event complex (SEC) approach (cf. Wood & Grafman, 2003) * Miller & Cohen's integrative theory of prefrontal functioning (e.g. Miller & Cohen, 2001) * Rolls's stimulus-reward approach and Stuss's anterior attentional functions (Burgess & Simons, 2005; Burgess, 2003; Burke, 2007). It may be highlighted that the theories described above differ in their focus on certain processes/systems or construct-lets. Stuss (1999) remarks that the question of homogeneity (single construct) or heterogeneity (multiple processes/systems) of function \\"may represent a problem of semantics and/or incomplete functional analysis rather than an unresolvable dichotomy\\" (p. 348). However, further research will show if a unified theory of frontal lobe function that fully accounts for the diversity of functions will be available. Other animals Many scientists had thought that the frontal lobe was disproportionately enlarged in humans compared to other primates. This was thought to be an important feature of human evolution and seen as the primary reason why human cognition differs from that of other primates. However, this view has since been challenged by neuroimaging studies. Using magnetic resonance imaging to determine the volume of the frontal cortex in humans, all extant ape species and several monkey species, it was found that the human frontal cortex was not relatively larger than the cortex of other great apes but was relatively larger than the frontal cortex of lesser apes and the monkeys. The higher cognition of the humans is instead seen to relate to a greater connectedness given by neural tracts that do not affect the cortical volume. This is also evident in the pathways of the language network connecting the frontal and temporal lobes.

Found in 1868 by 2 young local boys, Jim Quin and Paddy Flanagan, it is now on display in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin. It consists of the chalice, a much plainer stemmed cup in copper- alloy, and four brooches ‚Äî three elaborate pseudo-penannular ones, and one a true pennanular brooch of the thistle type; this is the latest object in the hoard, and suggests it may have been deposited around 900 AD.NMI, 185 The chalice ranks with the Book of Kells as one of the finest known works of Insular art, indeed of Celtic art in general, and is thought to have been made in the 8th century AD. Elaborate brooches, essentially the same as those worn by important laypeople, appear to have been worn by monastic clergy to fasten vestments of the period. Find The Ardagh Chalice, centrepiece of the hoard The hoard was found in late September 1868 by two boys, Jim Quin and Paddy Flanagan, digging in a potato field on the south-western side of a rath (ring fort) called Reerasta, beside the village of Ardagh, County Limerick, Ireland. Flanagan remained in Ireland and is buried in the Pauper's Graveyard in Newcastle West. Quin emigrated to Australia, spending his later years in Melbourne. He is buried in Fawkner Memorial Park in the city following his death there in 1934. The chalice held the other items, covered merely by a slab of stone; the pieces must have been interred in a hurry, probably temporarily, as though the owner probably intended to return for them at a later time. The age of the brooches found with the chalice is evidence that it was not buried until the Viking period. It was sold to George Butler, Catholic Bishop of Limerick, by Quin's mother. Chalice The chalice seen from below The chalice is a large, two-handled silver cup, decorated with gold, gilt bronze, brass, lead pewter and enamel, which has been assembled from 354 separate pieces; this complex construction is typical of early Christian Irish metalwork. The main body of the chalice is formed from two hemispheres of sheet silver joined with a rivet hidden by a gilt-bronze band. The width across its rim is wide. The names of the apostles are incised in a frieze around the bowl, below a girdle bearing inset gold wirework panels of animals, birds, and geometric interlace. Techniques used include hammering, engraving, lost-wax casting, filigree applique, cloisonn√© and enamel. Even the underside of the chalice is decorated (photo above). According to the art historian Lawrence Stone (writing before the discovery of the Derrynaflan Hoard): \\"Here the Irish artist has shown a capacity for classical restraint by a deliberate decision to prevent the ornamentation from spreading so copiously as to blur the proportions... contrasting markedly with the lavish ornamental spread of the almost contemporary Tara Brooch and the still more elaborate systems of the later period. The bulk of the decoration consists of exquisitely drawn spiral or interlace patterns, given depth by the soldering of two layers of gold thread one on top of the other. At intervals are set cloisonn√© enamel bosses of blue and red, the complicated manufacture of which shows direct continuity with the Anglo-Saxon jewellers' craft of the preceding century. But apart from the extraordinary perfection of execution of this elaborate decoration, what gives to the Ardagh Chalice its outstanding position in Irish metalwork is the strictness of the relationship between the simple swelling lines of the cup and its base and the arrangement of the glittering studs, bands, and roundels that adorn its surface.\\"Stone, 18 The standard monograph is L.S. G√≥gan, The Ardagh Chalice. The chalice is similar to the only other major early Irish example to survive, the Derrynaflan Chalice, found in the neighbouring County Tipperary. That was found with a paten and liturgical strainer. At that time the ruling dynasty in Tipperary and most of Munster were the E√≥ganachta, while their allies and possible cousins the U√≠ Fidgenti ruled in the Limerick area (see Byrne 2001; Begley 1906). Although the early suggestion that the chalice was fabricated at Clonmacnoise and stolen from there by a Limerick Dane is widely circulated, this is unprovable. A Munster origin is just as likely if not more so given the 1980 discovery of the sister Derrynaflan Hoard. A Clonmacnoise origin is not mentioned at the National Museum of Ireland website.The Ardagh Chalice; Object Number: IA:1874.99. National Museum of Ireland The chalice was featured on a ¬£1 value definitive postage stamp issued by An Post between 1990 and 1995 as part of the series Irish Heritage and Treasures designed by Michael Craig. Two Gaelic Athletic Association trophies are modelled on the Chalice: the O'Duffy Cup and the Sam Maguire Cup. NotesReferences * \\"NMI\\": Wallace, Patrick F., O'Floinn, Raghnall eds.

Kraft acquired Toblerone from owner Jacobs Suchard in 1990. It is produced in Bern, Switzerland and the bear symbol of the city is depicted in the logo. Toblerone is known for its distinctive shape, a series of joined triangular prisms. History Toblerone was created by Emil Baumann & Theodor Tobler (1876‚Äì1941) in Bern, Switzerland, in 1908. Emil Baumann, the cousin of Theodor Tobler, created the unique recipe consisting of milk chocolate including nougat, almonds, and honey. Theodor Tobler came up with the distinctive teardrop shape and packaging. The product's name is a portmanteau combining Tobler's name with the Italian word torrone (a type of nougat). The triangular shape of the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps is commonly believed to have given Theodor Tobler his inspiration for the shape of Toblerone. However, according to Theodor's sons, the triangular shape originates from a pyramid shape that dancers at the Folies Berg√®res created as the finale of a show that Theodor saw. Some early advertisements for Tobler chocolate appeared in the international languages Esperanto and Ido. Theodor Tobler applied for a patent for the Toblerone manufacturing process in Bern in 1909. The Toblerone brand was trademarked in 1909, at the Swiss Federal Institute of Intellectual Property in Bern. The Tobler company was independent for many years. In 1970, it merged with Suchard, the makers of Milka, to become Interfood. After the Tobler & Suchard merger it was decided to create a new and single source for Marketing & Exporting the various products manufactured by both companies worldwide, Multifood. Max E. Baumann, the son of Emil Baumann was made Director of this new Division. Tobler & Suchard companies merged with the Jacobs coffee company in 1982 to create Jacobs Tobler & Suchard. Mondelƒìz (Kraft Foods Inc at that time) acquired the majority of Jacobs Suchard, including Toblerone, in 1990. Sizes and variants Advertising in the 1960s included the production of a model Volkswagen Type 2 by Corgi Toys, featuring Toblerone designs on its side panels Bar sizes range from ten centimetres to nearly one metre, all similarly proportioned. According to Schott's Food & Drink Miscellany the sizes and number of peaks for Toblerones are as follows: {class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\" - ! Size(g)  Tiny  Mini  35 g  50 g  75 g  100 g  150 g  200 g  360 g  750 g  4.5 kg - ! Size(oz)    1.2 oz  1.7 oz  2.6 oz  3.5 oz  5.3 oz  7.0 oz  12.7 oz  26.5 oz  159 oz - ! Peaks  3  3  8  11  11  12  9  10  11  17  12 } For the yearly Toblerone Schoggifest, a special oversized bar is created to celebrate the bar's anniversary. The bar's weight represents the years of Toblerone, with the first bar in 2008 weighing 100 kg. Since the 1970s, other variants of Toblerone have been produced. These include: ; Plain chocolate: (dark chocolate) in a yellow or black triangular box (1969) ; White chocolate: in a white triangular box (1973) ; Snowtop: editions with white chocolate peaks, also in a white/silver triangular box ; Filled editions: milk chocolate with a white chocolate centre (blue triangular box) ; OneByOne: individually wrapped triangular chunks ; Toblerone Pralines: released in 1997, a single peaked version in the distinctive beige packaging ; Fruit and Nut: in 2007 with a half purple triangular cardboard box ; Honeycomb crisp: with a half white box with honeycomb pieces pictured on it (2009) ; Crunchy Salted Almond: with honey and almond nougat and salted caramelised almonds ; Berner B√§r: 500 g milk chocolate bar, with a relief portrait of the Bernese Bear and the Coat of arms of Bern on its face. The only non-triangular Toblerone. ; Toblerone Tobelle: Toblerone thins in a beige triangular box ; Crispy Coconut: with honey and almond nougat and coconut 2016 size changes In 2016 two peaks were removed and larger gaps were introduced between each peak, in two of the bars in the United Kingdom, to cut the weight of the bars and reduce costs, while retaining the same package size and retail price. This change reduced the weight of the 400g bar to 360g and of the 170g to 150g; other sizes of bar were unaffected. The change was not well received, with one MSP calling for \\"government action\\" by the Scottish Parliament over the change. In 2018, it was announced that the bars would revert to their original shape, and the 150g bar replaced by a 200g bar. Manufacturing In the past it has been manufactured in other locations including Bedford in England. In the 1970s and 1980s, it was manufactured under license for the Yugoslav market by Kra≈° in Zagreb (present-day Croatia). Similar products A similar product is the Croatian product Kolumbo, made by factory Kra≈° from Zagreb. This chocolate is also composed of pyramids of hazelnuts and honey. Kra≈° was producing Toblerone under license during the 1970s and 1980s. ... Another comparable product is Mahony, produced by the company Chocolat-Frey AG in Switzerland. In July 2017, in response to Toblerone's 2016 reduction in size, UK variety store chain Poundland launched its own version of Toblerone called \\"Twin Peaks\\", which is larger than the modified Toblerone bar.Selwood, Daniel. \\"Poundland unveils Twin Peaks, a Toblerone-style chocolate bar,\\" The Grocer, 19 June 2017. Retrieved 8 July 2017. Cultural impact The distinct pyramidal shape of the bar lent its name to the Toblerone line, a series of anti-tank emplacements prevalent in Switzerland's border areas. The interior of the Tobler factory in Switzerland was the location where the title sequence of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory was filmed. In 1995, it was revealed that the Swedish politician Mona Sahlin had misused her government-issued credit card for unauthorized purchases. Because she had bought, among many other more expensive items, two bars of Toblerone, pro-Sahlin journalists attempted to downplay her abuse of parliamentary financial privileges as the \\"Toblerone affair\\". These attempts were ultimately unsuccessful, and Sahlin was forced to step down as a candidate for the post as Prime Minister. She returned to politics in 1998. A triangular set of student residences on the Oxford Road, Manchester, for students of the University of Manchester built circa 1975 and resembling the chocolate bar are known as the Toblerones. The largest-sized Toblerone in production is featured as a running gag in the 2017 Netflix series Neo Yokio.

He was also Chairman and Leader of the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority (LFEPA) from May 2008 to 5 May 2012. Coleman was reprimanded in 2009 and 2011 for sending abusive emails to local residents who criticised him, breaching the council's code of conduct. After being charged with assault in October 2012, Coleman's membership of the Conservative Party was suspended. In May 2014, Coleman stood for re-election at the local elections as an independent candidate in the Totteridge ward, but failed to be elected gaining only 6% of the vote. Politics and controversy Coleman was a consistent opponent of redevelopment plans by Barnet Football Club, including their proposed move to Copthall Stadium and in May 2013 he said he rejoiced and called for the church bells of Barnet to be rung to celebrate the club's demotion from the Football League. During the subsequent Copthall application by Saracens rugby club, Coleman went on record as saying that his Boris Johnson would never allow Saracens to build a new joint-use community stadium. Both the Council and Boris Johnson passed the application despite Coleman's opposition. He was a critic of Hendon Football Club and the London 2012 Olympic Bid. Following the 7 July 2005 bombings in London, Coleman questioned on radio how safe it was for Londoners to travel by public transport. He is against the proposal for the North and West London Light Railway. In 2009 he said \\"It's not feasible, it won't happen. Ideas like this are thought up by men who probably still have a train set in the attic.\\" In June 2006 he criticised the planned refurbishment of Potter's Fields Park (between City Hall and Tower Bridge), saying that it should be replaced by a multi-storey car park In April 2004 Coleman was against Middlesex University's plans to expand its Trent Park campus because it was \\"a crap university\\" that could \\"only attract foreign\\" students.

A demonstration of support for Coleman's views, claiming that the campaign against him was anti-Zionist and anti-Semitic, took place outside the hearing at the Hendon Town Hall. Coleman appealed to the First-tier Tribunal against the ruling, but his appeal was rejected. Coleman still refused to comply with the tribunal's order that he should apologise, as the Council was reportedly looking for possible sanctions. Barnet Conservative group leader Richard Cornelius was reported to be furious for Coleman's failure to apologise. Barnet Council later sought to recover legal costs arising from his unsuccessful legal defence. Coleman appeared to have apologised at last, after Conservative group leader Cornelius confirmed that he was beginning the process of suspending Coleman from the Conservative group. Parking petition In February 2012, an East Finchley resident accused Coleman of ignoring a petition with 290 signatures from residents in East Finchley requesting a review into 10-minute free parking arrangements in front of a post office.

Among those with whom he was closely associated were Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Elisabeth Schumann, Hans Hotter, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, Victoria de los √Ångeles and Pablo Casals. Moore gave lectures on stage, radio and television about musical topics. He also wrote about music, publishing volumes of memoirs and practical guides to interpretation of lieder. Life and career=Early years Moore was born in Watford, Hertfordshire, the eldest of four children of David Frank Moore, owner of a men's outfitting company, and his wife Chestina, n√©e Jones.Cooper, Joseph. \\"Moore, Gerald Frederick (1899‚Äì1987)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 26 May 2013 He was educated at Watford Grammar School, and took piano lessons from a local teacher Mann, William S. \\"Moore, Gerald\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 26 May 2013 Though innately musical, with perfect pitch, Moore was a reluctant piano student: he later said that his mother had to drag him to the piano, \\"an unwilling, snivelling child ‚Äì I did not absorb music into my being until my middle twenties.\\"\\"Mr Gerald Moore\\", The Times, 17 March 1987, p. 14 When Moore was 13 the family emigrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where he studied with the pianist Michael Hambourg, a former pupil of Anton Rubinstein.Moore, p. 19; and Dawes, Frank and Carl Morey. \\"Hambourg\\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 28 May 2013 Moore was distracted from his musical studies by a strong attraction to Anglo- Catholicism; he thought for some time that he had a vocation to become a priest.Moore, pp. 19‚Äì20 In 1915 Hambourg died, after which his son, the cellist Boris Hambourg, took Moore as his accompanist on a tour of forty engagements in western Canada. On his return to Toronto Moore was engaged as organist at a local church, and later as a cinema organist, providing a musical accompaniment to silent films. This post was reasonably remunerative, but Moore described a cinema organ as an \\"instrument of torture ‚Ä¶ shar[ing] pride of place for sheer horror with the saxophone, the harmonica and the concertina.\\"Moore, p, 24 His parents concluded that Toronto was not the place for him to build the career as a pianist that they hoped for. They sent him back to England, to lodge with relatives in London, and pursue his studies with Michael Hambourg's pianist son, Mark.Moore, p. 26 Early career as accompanist While studying with Mark Hambourg, Moore earned money as an accompanist. The director of the Guildhall School of Music, Landon Ronald, heard him play at a recital and advised him to pursue a career as an accompanist.Moore, p. 29 In 1921 Moore made his first gramophone recording, accompanying the violinist Ren√©e Chemet for His Master's Voice (HMV).Moore, p. 52 They made several more recordings together,\\"Ren√©e Chemet (piano Gerald Moore)\\", AHRC Research Centre for the History and Analysis of Recorded Music, accessed 28 May 2013 but Moore's preference was for accompanying singers rather than instrumentalists. He recorded frequently with Peter Dawson in the early 1920s, and went on a recital tour of Britain with him; it was Dawson who recommended him to the tenor John Coates, who became an important influence on Moore's career.Moore, p. 34 Moore credited much of his early success to his five-year partnership with Coates, whom Moore credits with turning him from an indifferent accompanist into one who was sensitive to the music and the soloist, and an equal partner in performance.Moore, pp. 39‚Äì40 Another influence, figuring prominently in Moore's memoirs, was the pianist Solomon, whose technique Moore admired and studied.Moore, pp. 44‚Äì51 Peak years By the end of the 1930s Moore was so well known as an accompanist that Myra Hess invited him to give a talk about his profession at one of her of lunchtime concerts at the National Gallery. The pianist Joseph Cooper wrote of this, and later similar talks, \\"He revealed a sense of verbal timing of which any professional comic would be proud. His unique blend of wit and wisdom not only pleased the cognoscenti but also won over ordinary people who had no idea that classical music could be fun.\\" Moore's first book, The Unashamed Accompanist (1943), had its origins in these talks. Moore is credited with doing much to raise the status of accompanist from a subservient role to that of an equal artistic partner. Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau wrote in his introduction to the German edition of The Unashamed Accompanist, \\"There is no more of that pale shadow at the keyboard; he is always an equal with his partner\\".\\"die so schattenhafte Rolle des Klavierbe gleiters zum Range eines geichwertigen Partners erhoben\\", Fischer-Dieskau, Dietrich (1961). Introduction, in Gerald Moore, Freim√ºtige Bekenntnisse eines Begleiter, tr. Else and Walter Winter, Munich: Heim ran, OCLC 164765513 Moore valiantly protected this status of his art, complaining when accompanists he admired were not given billing in concert. He quoted with disapproval the remark made by a singer to Coenraad V Bos, an accompanist of an earlier generation, \\"You must have played well today, for I did not notice you.\\"Moore, p. 46 It is debatable, however, whether he succeeded in convincing the British Establishment of his time, of the uplifted status of his art. Whereas prominent conductors and singers, for example, in the British musical theatre tended to be awarded knighthoods, in 1954 Moore was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), a lower ranked award. Later years Moore retired from public performances in 1967, with a farewell concert in which he accompanied three of the singers with whom he was long associated: Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Victoria de los √Ångeles and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. This famed concert at London's Royal Festival Hall - recorded by EMI and reissued in 1987 as CDC 749238 - concluded with Moore playing alone‚Äîan arrangement for solo piano of Schubert's An die Musik . He made his last studio recording in 1975. In his memoirs Moore wrote that his services were not needed at Benjamin Britten's Aldeburgh Festival, \\"as the presiding genius there is the greatest accompanist in the world.\\" In 1967, the chief music critic of The Times, William Mann held that the preeminence was Moore's: \\"the greatest accompanist of his day, and perhaps of all time.\\"Mann, William. \\"Farewell to world's greatest accompanist\\", The Times, 21 February 1967, p. 8 In 2006 Gramophone magazine invited eminent present-day accompanists to name their \\"professional's professional\\", the joint winners were Britten and Moore.Gramophone, Volume 83, 2006, pp. 38‚Äì39 He died at home in the village of Penn, Buckinghamshire in 1987.

He is the current Chair of Parliament's Justice Select Committee. Biography Neill was born in Ilford to John Macgillivray Neill and Elsie May Neill (). Neill attended Abbs Cross Technical High School in Hornchurch. He took his law degree at the London School of Economics and in criminal law after graduating. He was later a councillor in the London Borough of Havering, served as Greater London Council member for Romford 1985‚Äì86. He previously stood for the Dagenham parliamentary constituency in 1983, at the age of 30, coming within 2,997 votes of winning the historically Labour seat from Bryan Gould MP. He refought the seat in 1987, coming even closer to winning by slightly cutting the Labour majority to 2,469, but Gould defeated him again. He also stood for election in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets in 1994 and 1998. Neill was first elected to the London Assembly in the 2000 assembly election, and served as the Conservative member for Bexley and Bromley from 2000 until 2008. He served as Leader of the Conservative Group on the Assembly from 2000 to 2002 and again from 2004. Between January 2013 and March 2015 he also served as a substitute member on the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. A pro-European, he supported former Conservative Chancellor Kenneth Clarke in both of his bids for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Neill is a Freemason.London Assembly ‚Äì Register of Members' Interests Since April 2017, Neill has been a Bencher at the Middle Temple. Neill was married from 2009 until 2015 to former Southend Conservative Councillor and former Mayor, Daphne White. In July 2018 he married Ann-Louise Whittaker, a teacher in Chislehurst. Bromley and Chislehurst by-election Following the death of Eric Forth in May 2006, on 3 June 2006 he was adopted as the Conservative candidate for the Bromley and Chislehurst by-election which took place on 29 June 2006. His selection by the local Conservative Association raised eyebrows, as new leader David Cameron had pressed for an \\"A-List\\" candidate, to help present Cameron's vision of the new Conservative Party. The Parliamentary constituency forms a part of Neill's London Assembly constituency. He stated at his selection that he would not resign his London Assembly seat as the resultant by-election, which would see around 400,000 voters go to the polls, would be unduly expensive. A few questions were raised about Neill's position as a non-executive director of the North East London Strategic Health Authority, which fell foul of the House of Commons Disqualification Act of 1975. His response was that, because the body was due to be abolished before he would have had the chance to take his seat in Westminster, any such arguments were immaterial. Neill won the by- election by just 633 votes, compared to the 13,342 majority achieved by his predecessor at the 2005 general election. Factors contributing to this were assumed by commentators to include a substantial drop in the turnout (down from 64.8 to 40.18%), with the drop disproportionally hitting the Conservative vote; the presence of a high-profile UKIP candidate, Nigel Farage ‚Äì Labour ended up coming fourth, after UKIP; and a campaign by the Liberal Democrats that heavily focused on Neill personally. In his acceptance speech Neill criticised \\"a minority of candidates\\" (which was assumed to be specifically criticising the Liberal Democrat candidate) for their ad hominem attacks on him. These included statements regarding Neill's occupations outside his future parliamentary role (including the nickname \\"Three Jobs Bob\\") and the fact that, at that time, he did not live in the constituency, although he has since purchased a house there.  In parliament  In 2008 Neill was made Shadow Local Government Minister and Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party and was assigned the shadow planning brief from January 2009. He was elected as MP for a second term in the May 2010 election and worked as Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Communities and Local Government until September 2012, when he was named Vice Chairman of the Conservative party for Local Government. Neill's approach to statistics and parliamentary privilege has been questioned by Dr Ben Goldacre. Neill claimed local government could save 20% from all services, based on a management consultant's estimate of how much could be saved from mobile phone bills. On 10 June 2010 Neill answering questions in the House of Commons as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government said, \\"Those in greatest need ultimately bear the burden of paying off the debt which this country has been left\\". The Opposition claimed that the north is taking far bigger cuts than the south and this was not challenged by Neill. Neill was re-elected for a third term in May 2015, shortly after which he was elected as Chairman of Parliament's Justice Select Committee. Following the General Election on 8 June 2017, he was returned to this role. Neill was strongly opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum. On 7 February 2017, along with six other Conservative Members of Parliament, he defied the Party whip and voted in favour of New Clause 110 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill. In December 2017, in the same bill, he voted along with fellow Conservative Dominic Grieve and nine other Tory MPs against the government, and in favour of guaranteeing Parliament a \\"meaningful vote\\" on any deal Theresa May agrees with Brussels over Brexit. Neill maintains Legal aid should be more widely available. Neill maintained that cuts to legal aid have gone too far and stated, \\"The evidence is pretty compelling that changes are needed ‚Ä¶ We cannot expect people who often have multiple problems in their lives necessarily to be able to resolve such things on their own.\\" Neill was knighted in the 2020 New Year Honours for political service. Neill came to prominence when he asked from Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis an assurance that the published Internal Market Bill would not breach international law and Lewis admitted that it would do so \\"in a very specific and limited way.\\"  Expenses  As of 2008, Neill claims an allowance for a second home outside London, despite his constituency home being only 12 miles from Westminster. A spokesman said that his claims were \\"in accordance with the rules\\".

Halsbury is a historic manor in the parish of Parkham, near Bideford, Devon, long the seat of the Giffard family and sold by them in the 18th. century. The title was created on 19 January 1898 for the lawyer and Conservative politician Hardinge Giffard, 1st Baron Halsbury. He was Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1885 to 1886, 1886 to 1892 and 1895 to 1905. Giffard had already been created Baron Halsbury, of Halsbury in the County of Devon, on 26 June 1885, and was made Viscount Tiverton, of Tiverton in the County of Devon, at the same time he was given the earldom. Those titles were also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was descended from the family of Giffard of Brightley, Chittlehampton, a junior line of Gifford of Halsbury. A younger son of the first of the Brightley family was Roger Giffard (d.1603) who purchased Tiverton Castle which he made his home.Vivian, Heralds' Visitations of Devon, 1895, pp.401-2, pedigree of Giffard The 1st Earl in fact had no close connection with Halsbury, as the closest of his ancestors born there was Sir Roger Giffard of Brightley (d.1547) and even less with Tiverton, the home of none of his ancestors but only of a very distant cousin,Vivian, Heralds' Visitations of Devon, 1895, pp.401-2, pedigree of Giffard but nevertheless chose these places as his titles. The 2nd Earl styled himself \\"Lord Tiverton\\" until his succession to the title in 1921, and as a major in the Royal Navy Air Service during World War I produced in September 1917 the first comprehensive plan for strategic bombing that became a major influence for plans and doctrine used by British and American air forces in World War II. Halsbury's grandson, the third Earl (who succeeded his father), was a scientist and the first Chancellor of Brunel University. The fourth Earl did not use his title and did not use the courtesy title of Viscount Tiverton which he was entitled to from 1943 to 2000. All the titles became extinct on his death in 2010.

In geometry and group theory, a lattice in \\\\mathbb{R}^n is a subgroup of the additive group \\\\mathbb{R}^n which is isomorphic to the additive group \\\\mathbb{Z}^n, and which spans the real vector space \\\\mathbb{R}^n. In other words, for any basis of \\\\mathbb{R}^n, the subgroup of all linear combinations with integer coefficients of the basis vectors forms a lattice. A lattice may be viewed as a regular tiling of a space by a primitive cell. Lattices have many significant applications in pure mathematics, particularly in connection to Lie algebras, number theory and group theory. They also arise in applied mathematics in connection with coding theory, in cryptography because of conjectured computational hardness of several lattice problems, and are used in various ways in the physical sciences. For instance, in materials science and solid-state physics, a lattice is a synonym for the \\"frame work\\" of a crystalline structure, a 3-dimensional array of regularly spaced points coinciding in special cases with the atom or molecule positions in a crystal. More generally, lattice models are studied in physics, often by the techniques of computational physics. Symmetry considerations and examples A lattice is the symmetry group of discrete translational symmetry in n directions. A pattern with this lattice of translational symmetry cannot have more, but may have less symmetry than the lattice itself. As a group (dropping its geometric structure) a lattice is a finitely-generated free abelian group, and thus isomorphic to \\\\mathbb{Z}^n. A lattice in the sense of a 3-dimensional array of regularly spaced points coinciding with e.g. the atom or molecule positions in a crystal, or more generally, the orbit of a group action under translational symmetry, is a translate of the translation lattice: a coset, which need not contain the origin, and therefore need not be a lattice in the previous sense. A simple example of a lattice in \\\\mathbb{R}^n is the subgroup \\\\mathbb{Z}^n. More complicated examples include the E8 lattice, which is a lattice in \\\\mathbb{R}^{8}, and the Leech lattice in \\\\mathbb{R}^{24}. The period lattice in \\\\mathbb{R}^2 is central to the study of elliptic functions, developed in nineteenth century mathematics; it generalises to higher dimensions in the theory of abelian functions. Lattices called root lattices are important in the theory of simple Lie algebras; for example, the E8 lattice is related to a Lie algebra that goes by the same name. Dividing space according to a lattice A typical lattice \\\\Lambda in \\\\mathbb{R}^n thus has the form : \\\\Lambda = \\\\left{\\\\left. \\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i v_i \\\\; \\\\right\\\\vert \\\\; a_i \\\\in\\\\mathbb{Z} \\\\right} where {v1, ..., vn} is a basis for \\\\mathbb{R}^n. Different bases can generate the same lattice, but the absolute value of the determinant of the vectors vi is uniquely determined by Œõ, and is denoted by d(Œõ). If one thinks of a lattice as dividing the whole of \\\\mathbb{R}^n into equal polyhedra (copies of an n-dimensional parallelepiped, known as the fundamental region of the lattice), then d(Œõ) is equal to the n-dimensional volume of this polyhedron. This is why d(Œõ) is sometimes called the covolume of the lattice. If this equals 1, the lattice is called unimodular. Lattice points in convex sets Minkowski's theorem relates the number d(Œõ) and the volume of a symmetric convex set S to the number of lattice points contained in S. The number of lattice points contained in a polytope all of whose vertices are elements of the lattice is described by the polytope's Ehrhart polynomial. Formulas for some of the coefficients of this polynomial involve d(Œõ) as well. Computational lattice problems Computational lattice problems have many applications in computer science. For example, the Lenstra‚ÄìLenstra‚ÄìLov√°sz lattice basis reduction algorithm (LLL) has been used in the cryptanalysis of many public-key encryption schemes, and many lattice- based cryptographic schemes are known to be secure under the assumption that certain lattice problems are computationally difficult. Lattices in two dimensions: detailed discussion Five lattices in the Euclidean plane There are five 2D lattice types as given by the crystallographic restriction theorem. Below, the wallpaper group of the lattice is given in IUC notation, Orbifold notation, and Coxeter notation, along with a wallpaper diagram showing the symmetry domains. Note that a pattern with this lattice of translational symmetry cannot have more, but may have less symmetry than the lattice itself. A full list of subgroups is available. For example below the hexagonal/triangular lattice is given twice, with full 6-fold and a half 3-fold reflectional symmetry. If the symmetry group of a pattern contains an n-fold rotation then the lattice has n-fold symmetry for even n and 2n-fold for odd n. { class=wikitable width=780 - !cmm, (2*22), [‚àû,2+,‚àû] !p4m, (*442), [4,4] !p6m, (*632), [6,3] - valign=top align=center 150px100px rhombic lattice also centered rectangular lattice isosceles triangular 150px75px square lattice right isosceles triangular 150px100px hexagonal lattice (equilateral triangular lattice) - !pmm, *2222, [‚àû,2,‚àû] !p2, 2222, [‚àû,2,‚àû]+ !p3m1, (*333), [3[3 - valign=top align=center 150px100px rectangular lattice also centered rhombic lattice right triangular 150px100px parallelogrammic lattice also oblique lattice scalene triangular 150px100px equilateral triangular lattice (hexagonal lattice) } For the classification of a given lattice, start with one point and take a nearest second point. For the third point, not on the same line, consider its distances to both points. Among the points for which the smaller of these two distances is least, choose a point for which the larger of the two is least. (Not logically equivalent but in the case of lattices giving the same result is just \\"Choose a point for which the larger of the two is least\\".) The five cases correspond to the triangle being equilateral, right isosceles, right, isosceles, and scalene. In a rhombic lattice, the shortest distance may either be a diagonal or a side of the rhombus, i.e., the line segment connecting the first two points may or may not be one of the equal sides of the isosceles triangle. This depends on the smaller angle of the rhombus being less than 60¬∞ or between 60¬∞ and 90¬∞. The general case is known as a period lattice. If the vectors p and q generate the lattice, instead of p and q we can also take p and p-q, etc. In general in 2D, we can take a p + b q and c p + d q for integers a,b, c and d such that ad-bc is 1 or -1. This ensures that p and q themselves are integer linear combinations of the other two vectors. Each pair p, q defines a parallelogram, all with the same area, the magnitude of the cross product. One parallelogram fully defines the whole object. Without further symmetry, this parallelogram is a fundamental parallelogram. The fundamental domain of the period lattice. The vectors p and q can be represented by complex numbers. Up to size and orientation, a pair can be represented by their quotient. Expressed geometrically: if two lattice points are 0 and 1, we consider the position of a third lattice point. Equivalence in the sense of generating the same lattice is represented by the modular group: T: z\\\\mapsto z+1 represents choosing a different third point in the same grid, S: z\\\\mapsto -1/z represents choosing a different side of the triangle as reference side 0-1, which in general implies changing the scaling of the lattice, and rotating it. Each \\"curved triangle\\" in the image contains for each 2D lattice shape one complex number, the grey area is a canonical representation, corresponding to the classification above, with 0 and 1 two lattice points that are closest to each other; duplication is avoided by including only half of the boundary. The rhombic lattices are represented by the points on its boundary, with the hexagonal lattice as vertex, and i for the square lattice. The rectangular lattices are at the imaginary axis, and the remaining area represents the parallelogrammetic lattices, with the mirror image of a parallelogram represented by the mirror image in the imaginary axis. Lattices in three dimensions The 14 lattice types in 3D are called Bravais lattices. They are characterized by their space group. 3D patterns with translational symmetry of a particular type cannot have more, but may have less symmetry than the lattice itself. Lattices in complex space A lattice in \\\\mathbb{C}^n is a discrete subgroup of \\\\mathbb{C}^n which spans the 2n-dimensional real vector space \\\\mathbb{C}^n. For example, the Gaussian integers form a lattice in \\\\mathbb{C}^n. Every lattice in \\\\mathbb{R}^n is a free abelian group of rank n; every lattice in \\\\mathbb{C}^n is a free abelian group of rank 2n. In Lie groups More generally, a lattice Œì in a Lie group G is a discrete subgroup, such that the quotient G/Œì is of finite measure, for the measure on it inherited from Haar measure on G (left-invariant, or right-invariant‚Äîthe definition is independent of that choice). That will certainly be the case when G/Œì is compact, but that sufficient condition is not necessary, as is shown by the case of the modular group in SL2(R), which is a lattice but where the quotient isn't compact (it has cusps). There are general results stating the existence of lattices in Lie groups. A lattice is said to be uniform or cocompact if G/Œì is compact; otherwise the lattice is called non-uniform. Lattices in general vector- spaces While we normally consider \\\\mathbb{Z} lattices in \\\\mathbb{R}^n this concept can be generalized to any finite-dimensional vector space over any field. This can be done as follows: Let K be a field, let V be an n-dimensional K-vector space, let B = {\\\\mathbf{v}_1,\\\\ldots, \\\\mathbf{v}_n} be a K-basis for V and let R be a ring contained within K. Then the R lattice \\\\mathcal{L} in V generated by B is given by: :\\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\left{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \\\\mathbf{v}_i \\\\mid a_i \\\\in R\\\\right}. In general, different bases B will generate different lattices. However, if the transition matrix T between the bases is in GL_n(R) \\\\- the general linear group of R (in simple terms this means that all the entries of T are in R and all the entries of T^{-1} are in R - which is equivalent to saying that the determinant of T is in R^* \\\\- the unit group of elements in R with multiplicative inverses) then the lattices generated by these bases will be isomorphic since T induces an isomorphism between the two lattices. Important cases of such lattices occur in number theory with K a p-adic field and R the p-adic integers. For a vector space which is also an inner product space, the dual lattice can be concretely described by the set :\\\\mathcal{L}^* = {\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\in V \\\\mid \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v},\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\rangle \\\\in R\\\\,\\\\text{ for all }\\\\,\\\\mathbf{x} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{L}}, or equivalently as :\\\\mathcal{L}^* = {\\\\mathbf{v} \\\\in V \\\\mid \\\\langle \\\\mathbf{v},\\\\mathbf{v}_i \\\\rangle \\\\in R,\\\\ i = 1, ..., n}.

First elected as a Conservative he was an independent Member of Parliament for Croydon Central and on 30 March 2010 announced his intention to contest the seat as an Independent at the 2010 general election, but lost the seat to his former party. He was also a member of the London Assembly for Croydon and Sutton and a councillor in Croydon. Pelling has since become a member of the Labour Party, in February 2011.  Education and local government  Pelling and his family have lived in Croydon for six generations. He was educated at the Trinity School, Croydon and then New College, Oxford, where he led the Oxford University Conservative Association. He was elected to the position of Librarian of the Oxford Union, a senior position, and ran for President several times without being elected, on one occasion losing to William Hague. Before becoming a full-time politician, he was an international investment banker. He was elected to Croydon Council in 1982 in Broad Green ward and later represented the ward of Heathfield. He served as Chair, first of the Education Committee in the early 1990s and subsequently became Deputy Leader of the Conservative Group when they lost control of the Council in 1994. From 2002 until 2005, he was the leader of the Conservative group in Croydon and stepped down from the Council in 2006 after 24 years. Pelling was first elected to the London Assembly in 2000, and retained his seat in 2004. He was a member of the London Development Agency and chaired the GLA budget committee.  Political career  At the 2005 general election, Pelling won the Croydon Central parliamentary seat by 75 votes, beating the incumbent, Labour's Geraint Davies. On 28 May 2007 Pelling was one of 18 Conservative MPs to vote in favour of an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act proposed by David Maclean, which would have seen the Houses of Parliament and MPs exempted from the disclosure requirements of the Act. However, he was 625th out of 646 MPs in the expenses league table and did not take a second-home allowance. On 18 September 2007 Pelling was arrested on suspicion of assaulting his wife Lucy after the Metropolitan Police received a complaint. He was released on bail later that night after being questioned. The police later announced that no charges were to be made against Pelling nor would the Crown Prosecution Service prosecute. The allegations caused the Conservatives to remove the whip, suspending him from the party. In December 2007, Pelling announced that he would not seek re-election for Parliament nor the London Assembly, but he subsequently decided to contest the Croydon Central seat as an Independent, saying \\"I am very much up for representing Croydon for another term, there are lots of important issues to speak about.\\" He said that as an Independent, he had the political freedom to best serve Croydon. He has been quoted as saying \\"Independence has allowed me to do politics differently, enabling me to put Croydon residents ahead of party politics and to lobby effectively for Croydon by being non-partisan. I do not have to obey party bosses and so can speak out for Croydon and on issues like immigration, an EU membership referendum and foolish overseas wars that the parties prefer not to speak of.\\" According to Pelling's own website, \\"The Leader of London's Green Party once called me 'the acceptable face of Conservatism'.\\" When he was on the GLA, the Mayor Ken Livingstone said \\"although he is a wicked Conservative, I do suggest you ask your Local GLA Member, Andrew Pelling, because he does take up local issues\\". Pelling lost his seat to the Conservatives at the 2010 general election. He is still active in political circles, attending the 2010 Labour Party Conference in Manchester. In February 2011 it was announced that he had joined the Labour Party. In June 2013 it was announced that we would be standing in the upcoming Croydon Council elections for the marginal seat of Waddon. He was elected to Croydon Council on 22 May 2014.Andrew Pelling to stand for Labour in Waddon Croydon Advertiser, 12 June 2013; Retrieved 27 October 2013 Personal life Pelling was married to Sanae for 16 years, and the couple had three children all educated at local schools. In 2006, Pelling married Lucy. They have since separated after allegations of assault.

He was the author of more than 30 books and more than 2,000 stories and essays and is most famous for his short story \\"Pigs Is Pigs\\", in which a bureaucratic stationmaster insists on levying the livestock rate for a shipment of two pet guinea pigs, which soon start proliferating exponentially. His most famous character was Philo Gubb. His career spanned more than forty years, and his stories, poems, and articles were published in more than 225 magazines. His work appeared alongside that of his contemporaries, including Mark Twain, Sax Rohmer, James B. Hendryx, Berton Braley, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Don Marquis, Will Rogers, and Edgar Rice Burroughs. Despite the enormous volume of his work, Butler was, for most of his life, only a part-time author. He worked full-time as a banker and was very active in his local community. A founding member of both the Dutch Treat Club and the Authors League of America, Butler was an always-present force in the New York City literary scene. Biography Butler was born in Muscatine, Iowa on December 5, 1869. He moved to New York City and lived in Flushing (Queens) New York. He wrote twenty-five stories for Woman's Home Companion between 1906 and 1935. The stories in the Companion were illustrated by artists including May Wilson Preston, Frederic Dorr Steele, Herbert Paus and Rico Le Brun. Between 1931 and 1936, at least seventeen of Butler's stories published in newspapers were illustrated by Ethel Hays. He died in Williamsville, Massachusetts on September 13, 1937, and was interred in Flushing Cemetery.

They span the border between the Canadian province of British Columbia and the U.S. state of Washington and are officially named in the U.S. and Canada as the Cascade Mountains. The portion in Canada is known to Americans as the Canadian Cascades, a designation that also includes the mountains above the east bank of the Fraser Canyon as far north as the town of Lytton, at the confluence of the Thompson and Fraser Rivers. They are predominantly non-volcanic, but include the stratovolcanoes Mount Baker, Glacier Peak and Coquihalla Mountain, which are part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc. Geography The U.S. section of the North Cascades and the adjoining Skagit Range in British Columbia are most notable for their dramatic scenery and challenging mountaineering, both resulting from their steep, rugged topography. While most of the peaks are under in elevation, the low valleys provide great local relief, often over . The summits of the rest of the Canadian Cascades are not glaciated in the same way and feature rock \\"horns\\" rising from plateau-like uplands, with the Manning Park and Cathedral Park areas known for their extensive alpine meadows, as is also the case with the eastern flank of the US portion of the range. Portions of the US side of the range are protected as part of North Cascades National Park. Typical landscape in the western part of the North Cascades The large amount of precipitation, much of it in the form of snow, and the resulting glaciation, combine with the regional uplift to create a dramatic landscape in the western part of the range. Deep, U-shaped valleys carved by glaciers in Pleistocene time separate sharp ridges and peaks carved into steep shapes by more recent snow and ice. The eastern and northernmost parts of the range are much more plateau-like in character, though in the case of the northernmost areas graven by deep valleys along the flank of the Fraser Canyon, notably that of the Anderson River. Extent The North Cascades are considered the most rugged mountain range in the contiguous United States. The Fraser River and the adjoining lowland on its south bank form the northern and northwestern boundary of the range. On the east, the Okanogan River and the Columbia River bound the range in the United States, while the northeastern boundary of the range departs the Thompson via the Nicoamen River and runs via Lawless Creek, the Tulameen River and Copper Creek to the Similkameen River. On the west, the foothills of the range are separated by a narrow coastal plain from Puget Sound except along Chuckanut Drive between Bellingham and Mount Vernon, where they abut the Sound directly. Glacier Peak is the dominant feature in the southern portion of the North Cascades. The southern boundary of the North Cascades is less definite. For the purposes of this article, it will be taken as U.S. Highway 2, running over Stevens Pass, or equivalently, the Skykomish River, Nason Creek, and the lower Wenatchee River. This roughly follows Beckey's geologic division in Cascade Alpine Guide and the definition used by Peakbagger.com. Sometimes the southern boundary is defined by Snoqualmie Pass and the approximate route of Interstate 90.Level III and Level IV Ecoregions of the Northwestern United States , U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Western Ecology Division Sometimes the term \\"North Cascades\\" or \\"northern Cascades\\" is used for the entire range north of the Columbia River. Geologically, the rocks of the North Cascades extend south beyond Stevens Pass and west into the San Juan Islands. The significance of the geologic transitions to the Okanagan Highland to the east and the Interior Plateau and Coast Mountains to the north are less agreed upon. Climate The climate in the North Cascades varies considerably by location and elevation. The western slope of the range is wet and cool, with of precipitation per year. This produces a temperate rain forest climate in the low valleys, which then grades into montane and alpine climates on mountain slopes and peaks. Summers are comparatively dry, with far less precipitation than in winter; sometimes the warmer eastern air and cooler western air meet at the Cascades during the summer months, and form thunderstorms. Sometimes, the storms move downwind into lowland cities. The eastern slope lies in the rain shadow of the range, since prevailing winds and most moisture come from the west, and hence is significantly drier than the western side of the main divide, becoming semi-arid in the eastern lowlands. As with most mountainous areas, precipitation increases dramatically with increasing elevation. As a result, there is a great deal of winter snow and glaciation in the high North Cascades. The eastern slopes and mountain passes can receive significant snowfall. Cold Arctic air can flow south from British Columbia through the Okanogan River valley into the bowl-like basin east of the Cascades. Cold air damming causes this Arctic air to bank up along the eastern Cascade slopes, especially into the lower passes, such as Snoqualmie Pass and Stevens Pass. The milder, Pacific-influenced air moving east over the Cascades is often forced aloft by the cold air held in place in the passes due to cold air damming. As a result, the passes often receive more snow than higher areas in the Cascades. This effect makes the relatively low elevation ski resorts at Snoqualmie Pass (about ) and Stevens Pass (about ) possible. Subranges The Picket Range, located north of Hwy 20, is the most rugged subrange of the North Cascades. *North Cascades **Skagit Range ***Picket Range **Chuckanut Mountains **Entiat Mountains **Chelan Mountains **Methow Mountains (also called Sawtooth Ridge) **Skagit River Group Entiat Mountains *Canadian Cascades **Skagit Range ***Hope Mountains ***Cheam Range **Hozameen Range ***Bedded Range **Okanagan Range **Coquihalla Range (name is unofficial) ***Llamoid Group (name is unofficial) ***Anderson River Group (name is unofficial) Geology The bulk of the North Cascades consists of \\"deformed and metamorphosed, structurally complex pre-Tertiary rocks\\". These originated in diverse locations around the globe: the area is built of several (\\"perhaps ten or more\\") different terranes of different ages and origins. These terranes are separated by a series of ancient faults, the most significant being the Straight Creek Fault, which runs north-south from north of Yale, British Columbia, through Hope, Marblemount, Washington, and down to Kachess Lake near Snoqualmie Pass. There is evidence of significant strike-slip movement on this fault in the past, with similar rocks on either side of the fault separated by dozens of miles. This is thought to be related to northward tectonic movement of the West Coast relative to the rest of North America. Since about 35 million years ago, oceanic crust from the Pacific Ocean has been subducting under the continental margin, which has formed the current volcanoes as well as a number of igneous intrusions composed of diorite and gabbro. The current uplift of the Cascade Range began around 8 million years ago. Northern flank of Coquihalla Mountain Rocks similar to those in the North Cascades continue north to the vicinity of Mount Meager massif in the Coast Mountains, where they abut the Stikinia Terrane of the Omineca-Intermontane Province that dominates the Interior Plateau of British Columbia. This geologic similarity between the North Cascades and Coast Mountains results in a fairly arbitrary boundary between the two. In British Columbia, the western geologic boundary of the North Cascades is defined as the Fraser River as it follows the Straight Creek Fault, while in the United States the western boundary is defined by the Puget Lowlands in the west, although there are significant westward extensions of rocks similar in origin to those in the North Cascades found in the San Juan Islands. The eastern geologic boundary of the North Cascades may be marked by the Chewack-Pasayten Fault. This fault separates the easternmost portion of the North Cascades, the Methow Terrane, from the Quesnellia Terrane, one of the Omineca and Intermontane Belts. The fault also separates the Methow River valley, part of the Methow Terrane, from the Okanagan Range, part of the Quesnellia Terrane. The Columbia River Basalt Group bounds the North Cascades to the southeast. The southern limit of what is geologically considered the \\"North Cascades\\" may variously be defined as being the southern limit of exposure of igneous and metamorphic terranes which is generally north of Snoqualmie Pass, Snoqualmie Pass itself, or Naches Pass at the White River Fault Zone. Glaciers Mount Baker and the upper Coleman Glacier While alpine glaciers are a defining feature of the Cascade Range as a whole, this is especially true of the North Cascades. The stratovolcanoes (Mount Baker and Glacier Peak) are the most obviously glaciated peaks and have the largest glaciers, but many of the smaller, nonvolcanic peaks are glaciated as well. For example, the portion of the Cascades north of Snoqualmie Pass (roughly the North Cascades as defined in this article) These glaciers all retreated from 1900-1950. From 1950-1975 many but not all North Cascades glaciers advanced. Since 1975 retreat has become more rapid with all 107 glaciers monitored retreating by 1992. 2015 was an especially damaging year for Cascadian Glaciers, an estimated mass loss of five to ten percent, the single greatest loss in over 50 years.Doughton, Sandi. \\"'Disastrous': Low Snow, Heat Eat Away at Northwest Glaciers.\\" The Seattle Times. Seattle Times, 08 Sept. 2015. Web. 15 Dec. 2015. . There are approximately 700 glaciers in the range, though some have already disappeared. Since a brief advancing period in the 1950s, most of these glaciers have been retreating. This is a serious concern to water managers in the region, as the glaciers (and the winter snowpack) form a large reservoir of water. As snow and ice melts in the summer, the resulting meltwater compensates for the seasonal decrease in precipitation. As glaciers retreat they will provide less summer runoff. The Cascades north of Snoqualmie Pass have 756 glaciers covering of terrain. For comparison, the entire contiguous United States has about 1,100 glaciers in total, covering . Ecology Subalpine Fir and Mountain Hemlock above Lower Thornton Lake The North Cascades has a diversity of plant species. It contains more than 1630 vascular plant species There are eight distinct life zones that support thousands of plants separately and in their own way. Traveling west to east through the range, one would intersect a number of distinct ecoregions, first getting higher and colder, then getting warmer, yet drier. Each of these component ecoregions can be described by either a tree indicator species, or by a lack of trees: Western hemlock, silver fir, subalpine mountain hemlock, Alpine tundra, subalpine fir, and grand fir/Douglas-fir. The range also has a rich diversity of animals, including bald eagles, wolves, grizzly bears, mountain lions and black bears. The range is home to at least 75 species of mammals and 200 species of birds that either pass through or use the North Cascades for a breeding area. There are also 11 species of fish on the west side of the Cascades. Examples of amphibian species occurring in the North Cascades include the western toad (Bufo boreas) and the rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa). The biodiversity of the area is threatened by global climate change and invasive exotic plant species. These exotic plants thrive by utilizing manmade structures such as roads and trails. These invasive plants include the diffuse knapweed (Centaurea diffusa) and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea). History Big log in the North Cascades, 1937 On the United States side of the border, early inhabitants of the North Cascades included the Nooksack, Skagit, and Sauk-Suiattle tribes on the west, and the Okanagan people on the eastern side, with the Nlaka'pamux people of what is now Canada claiming hunting territory in the heart of the range, south across the border into Washington. The tribes living and using the range on the Canadian side of the border are the Nlaka'pamux, Sto:lo and the Upper and Lower Similkameen subgroups of the Okanagan. A now-extinct group known as the Nicola Athapaskans also inhabited and hunted in the area now occupied by the Similkameen. Many current geographic names in the region are derived from native terms, either by transliteration or translation. Beckey notes that \\"Many names were derived from Chinook Jargon, mostly applied by the United States Forest Service from 1910 to 1940....\\" Fur traders entered the area in the first half of the 19th century, coming from Canada and from Astoria on the Columbia River. One of the earliest was Alexander Ross of the North West Company, who crossed the range in the summer of 1814, probably via Cascade Pass. The period of uncertainty surrounding the disputed Oregon Country gave way following partition along the 49th Parallel to a period of tentative U.S. Army exploration in tandem with violent subjugation of Indian tribes on the American side of the frontier in the second half of the century. With the partition, the Hudson's Bay Company was forced to seek an alternative to its older Brigade Trail via the Okanogan River and the construction of a new route over the northern spine of the Canadian Cascades from the area of Spuzzum into the valley of the Coldwater River to connect fort Langley on the lower Fraser with its northern posts in New Caledonia. The route was impracticable and was soon abandoned, though more southerly routes through what is now Manning Park laid the foundations for later routes such as the Dewdney Trail and the modern Crowsnest Highway via Allison Pass, and was later similar to a route via the Coquihalla Pass for its southern mainline. South of the boundary, reconnaissance for possible railroad routes (none of which were viable north of the one eventually put in over Stevens Pass, at the southern edge of the North Cascades) and various mining rushes. Klawatti Glacier, North Cascades National Park (1969) Miners dominated the exploration and development of the range from the 1880s through the early 20th century. For example, mines around the boomtown of Monte Cristo, in the southwest portion of the North Cascades, produced \\"between $1 and $2.7 million in silver and gold\\". The Holden Mine, on the east side of the main divide, produced 106,000 tons of copper and 600,000 ounces of gold. Discovery of gold by American prospectors on the banks of the Thompson River at its confluence with the Nicoamen River, at the northern tip of the range, helped trigger the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858-1860 which in turn prompted the declaration of the Colony of British Columbia to affirm British possession of territories north of the 49th Parallel. The Fraser rush led to exploration of the Cascades to the east of the canyon and in the valley of the Similkameen River, with minor rushes in the area of Princeton, British Columbia in 1859 through the early 1860s and the creation of non-native towns (on top of much older native ones) at Boston Bar, Lytton and Hope, as well as Princeton. Early settlers also arrived in the foothills of the North Cascades in the latter half of the 19th century, and utilized the range in a limited way as a source of timber and grazing land. However, the range is so rugged that this exploitation was less dramatic than in other more gentle landscapes. Early recreational use of the range included expeditions by the local climbing clubs, The Mountaineers and The Mazamas. However even these groups did not fully explore the inner reaches of the range and ascend the most difficult peaks until the 1930s and 1940s. It was not until the 1970s, that most peaks were climbed in the most isolated areas, making it one of the last explored ranges in the contiguous United States. Climbing The North Cascades are often referred as the \\"American Alps\\" by hikers, climbers and mountaineers because of the sea of steep, jagged peaks that span across the range. This range's rugged approaches and exceptional alpine terrain make it a premiere training ground for mountain climbers.

It was the first role- playing game published in German and the first to be created in Germany. Midgard is also the name of the world on which the game is usually played (originally named Magira but later renamed due to legal problems). However, the rules of the game are designed in a way that makes it possible to play Midgard on nearly every world.  Game mechanics  Midgard, in its 1985 edition, was the first role-playing game system that separated exhaustion points from hit points. While the number of exhaustion points increases with the character's level, hit points usually remain constant. This has the effect that experienced characters can fight longer and cast more spells but they may still be inflicted serious wounds by a direct hit. Midgard uses D20 for attacks, spells and skills. An action succeeds if the sum of the rolled value and the corresponding success score (Erfolgswert, usually +4 to +20) is at least 20. The success score depends on the weapon or skill but is the same for all magical spells. Spells, however, cost exhaustion points and differ in the number of points they cost. For attacks and attack spells, the damage is rolled with D6. The number of dice and the modifier depend on the weapon or spell used for the attack. For example, a dagger may inflict 1D6-1 (roll one D6 and subtract 1) whereas a lance may inflict up to 3D6+3 (roll three D6 and add three, in case of a mounted charge). A damage modifier (ranging from -3 to +5, depending on strength and dexterity) is added to the damage roll. The attacked player may try to parry or evade by rolling a D20. This is successful if the roll plus the character's defense or resistance score is equal to or larger than the sum achieved by the attacker, and the character only loses exhaustion points (light damage). Otherwise, the character loses both hit and exhaustion points (heavy damage), whereby the number of hit points (but not exhaustion points) lost may be reduced by armour. D100 are used for tests (Pr√ºfwurf) against the character's attributes (e.g. strength or magical talent), which range from 1 to 100. The player rolls a D100 (usually replaced with two D10) and the test is successful if the roll is below or equal the character's attribute score (Eigenschaftswert). Compared to Advanced Dungeons and Dragons or The Dark Eye (editions 1, 2 and 3), Midgard (and The Dark Eye editions 4 and 5) does not emphasise the character's level very much. Characters may learn at any time, only limited by their experience points. The level increases when the player has spent a certain amount of experience points. He or she may then spend some more experience points to increase the number of exhaustion points and there's a slight chance (determined by D100) that the score of one of the base attributes increases.

The first creation, in the Peerage of Great Britain, was in 1788 for Richard Howe, but became extinct on his death in 1799. The second creation, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom was in 1821 for Richard Curzon, and remains extant. History=First creation (1788) The Howe family descended from John Grobman Howe, of Langar, Nottinghamshire. He married Annabella, illegitimate daughter of Emanuel Scrope, 1st Earl of Sunderland. Their son, Scrope Howe, sat as a Knight of the Shire for Nottinghamshire. In 1701 he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Glenawley and Viscount Howe. The second Viscount also represented Nottinghamshire in the House of Commons and served as Governor of Barbados. He married Charlotte, Baroness von Kielmansegg, niece of George I. Her mother was the illegitimate half-sister of the King. Lord Howe was succeeded by his son, the third Viscount. He was a Brigadier-General in the British Army and was killed during the Battle of Carillon in 1758. He was succeeded by his younger brother, Richard, the fourth Viscount. He was a distinguished naval commander best known for his victory of the Glorious First of June in 1794. In 1782 Howe was created Viscount Howe, of Langar in the County of Nottingham, in the Peerage of Great Britain, which entitled him to a seat in the House of Lords. In 1788 he was further honoured when he was made Baron Howe, of Langar in the County of Nottingham, with remainder to his daughters and the heirs male of their bodies, and Earl Howe, with normal remainder to heirs male of his body. These titles were also in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Howe had no male issue and on his death in 1799 the viscountcy of 1782 and earldom became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony of Howe according to the special remainder by his eldest daughter Sophia Charlotte (see below). The Irish titles passed to his younger brother, William, the fifth Viscount. He was a noted soldier and served as Commander- in-Chief of the Forces in North America during the American Revolutionary War. He had no surviving issue and on his death in 1814 the barony of Glenawly and viscounty of Howe became extinct. Second creation (1821) The aforementioned Lady Sophia Charlotte, who succeeded her father as second Baroness Howe in 1799, married the Hon. Penn Curzon, Member of Parliament for Clitheroe. He was the only son of Assheton Curzon, second son of Sir Nathaniel Curzon, 4th Baronet, of Kedleston (ancestor of George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston, and the Barons and Viscounts Scarsdale; see Viscount Scarsdale for earlier history of the family). Assheton Curzon represented Clitheroe in the House of Commons for twenty-seven years. In 1794 he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Curzon, of Penn in the County of Buckingham, and in 1802 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Curzon, of Penn in the County of Buckingham, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord Curzon was succeeded by his grandson, the second Viscount. He was the only son of Penn Curzon and Lady Howe. In 1821 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Howe and the same year the earldom held by his maternal grandfather was revived when he was created Earl Howe in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. In 1835 he also succeeded his mother as third Baron Howe. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He sat as Conservative Member of Parliament for Leicestershire South. William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe He died without male issue and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Earl. He was a General in the British Army. His eldest son, the fourth Earl, was a Conservative politician and held minor office in the Conservative administration of 1895 to 1905. On his death in 1929 the title passed to his eldest son, the fifth Earl. He was a Conservative Member of Parliament and also involved in the world of motor racing. His only son, the sixth Earl, had four daughters but no sons and on his death in 1984 the line of the fourth Earl failed. The late Earl was succeeded by his second cousin, the seventh Earl. He is the only son of the actor George Curzon, son of the Hon. Frederick Graham Curzon-Howe, second son of the third Earl. Lord Howe held office from 1991 to 1997 in the Conservative administrations of John Major and since 2015 has been Deputy Leader of the House of Lords and Minister of State for Defence. He is now one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. As a descendant of Sir Nathaniel Curzon, 4th Baronet, of Kedleston, he is also in remainder to this title, which is held by his kinsman the Viscount Scarsdale. Several other members of the Curzon-Howe family have also gained distinction. The Hon. Frederick Howe (1823‚Äì1881), third son of the first Earl, was a Captain in the Royal Navy. The Hon. Ernest George Howe (1828‚Äì1885), sixth son of the first Earl, was a Colonel in the British Army. The Hon. Sir Leicester Smyth (1829‚Äì1891) (who assumed the surname of Smyth in 1866), seventh son of the first Earl, was a General in the British Army and served as Governor of Gibraltar. The Hon. Montagu Curzon (1846‚Äì1907), eighth son of the first Earl (and eldest from his second marriage), was a Colonel in the Rifle Brigade and Member of Parliament. The Hon. Sir Assheton Curzon-Howe, ninth son and youngest child of the first Earl, was a naval commander and served as Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet from 1908 to 1910. His eldest son Leicester Charles Assheton St John Curzon-Howe (1894‚Äì1941) was a Captain in the Royal Navy. Lady Mary Anna Curzon, only daughter of the second marriage of the first Earl, married James Hamilton, 2nd Duke of Abercorn. Their granddaughter Lady Cynthia Hamilton married Albert Spencer, 7th Earl Spencer, and was the grandmother of Diana, Princess of Wales. The aforementioned George Curzon, son of the Hon. Frederick Graham Curzon-Howe, second son of the third Earl, was an actor. The family seat is Penn House, Penn Street, Buckinghamshire.

His name is given to the Sewel motion, parliamentary device passed by the Scottish Parliament, in which it agrees that the United Kingdom parliament may pass legislation on a devolved issue extending to Scotland, over which the Scottish Parliament has regular legislative authority. He left ministerial office in 1999 upon the new Parliament taking over the majority of the Scottish Office's functions. Sewel left the House of Lords in 2015 after being the subject of a drugs scandal. Early life Sewel was born on 15 January 1946.

History and characteristics InstaPundit was launched in August 2001 as an experiment, and a part of Reynolds' class on Internet law. After the September 11 attacks, the site quickly became a highly popular blog‚Äîwith Reynolds celebrated as \\"chief among the warbloggers\\"‚Äîand was dubbed the \\"Grand Central Station of Bloggerville\\" in 2002 and reported to be \\"the most visited [blog] in the world\\" in early 2004. A 2007 memo from the National Republican Senatorial Committee described Reynolds as one of the five \\"best-read national conservative bloggers.\\"GOP issues rules to avoid Macaca moments, Carrie Budoff, Politico.com, Jun 13, 2007 Common topics are politics, technology (such as nanotechnology), space exploration, human longevity, digital photography, individual liberty and gun politics, domestic policy, the media, and the blogosphere as a social phenomenon. Instapundit frequently discussed the War on Terrorism from a supportive-but-critical viewpoint. Reynolds has also lent his support to the Porkbusters campaign, which purports to expose misallocation of federal funds. Much of Instapundit's content consists of links to other sites, particularly those that Reynolds believes offer viewpoints not widely expressed elsewhere, often with brief comments. His frequent use of \\"heh,\\" \\"indeed,\\" and \\"read the whole thing\\" have been widely imitated and are often parodied by other bloggers. Reynolds encourages readers to explore the wider blogosphere and to fully read articles and posts to which he links. Since 2005, Reynolds has at times added original video reports, shot documentary-style, to the site. He covered the 2005 BlogNashville convention using video he shot himself.http://pajamasmedia.com/instapundit/vids/blognashvillemed.wmv In January 2006, Reynolds began to host podcastsList of Podcasts from Instapundit.com from Instapundit, along with his wife Dr. Helen Smith (who hosted discussion of the podcasts on her blog). The blogcasts have now given way to a video series on PajamasMedia called InstaVision, which Reynolds hosts individually (his wife contributes to PJM as well, but usually covers as a separate blogger). Reynolds aggressively promoted the idea that bloggers, using now widely available tools such as digital audio and video, will eventually force established news media to adapt a more agile approach to providing information, though he never believed \\"that blogs will replace Big Media\\".Instapundit post , December 31, 2004 Political views Reynolds says he is not a conservative, but a libertarian,Instapundit post , February 20, 2006 specifically a libertarian transhumanist.Instapundit post . February 21, 2006 He favors free markets and distrusts bureaucracy. To this end he opposes government interference in both the economic and personal affairs of citizens. He strongly supported the War on Terrorism and has lent some support to the war in Iraq. He is an advocate for gun rights, has singled out European Union, the United Nations, Islamic governments, American academia, and mainstream media as targets of critical remarks and links; he also believes there is systemic bias in mainstream media. He believes there is an economic \\"bubble\\" forming in higher education, and that under most circumstances college students should avoid going into debt for the sake of getting credentials. He frequently points out that college degrees, or credentials, are not the same as an education. Reynolds, who worked for Al Gore's 1988 campaign,Harriet Who?, Glenn Reynolds, MSNBC.com, October 3, 2005 now agrees with the conservative movement on many issues, including the war in Iraq, tax cuts, and some environmental issues. He has vigorously criticized Republicans for wasteful government spending for many years. His association with the conservative side of U.S. politics included a book-signing appearance at the 2006 Conservative Political Action Conference,.Pictures from CPAC, Dr Helen, February 10, 2006 Reynolds holds libertarian positions on many social issues. For example, he supports embryonic stem cell research, abortion rights, legal prostitution, and both same-sex civil unions and marriage. He has stated a number of times: \\"Personally, I'd be delighted to live in a country where happily married gay couples had closets full of assault weapons.\\" Instapundit post, October 04, 2004 Reynolds believes global warming is \\"plausib[ly]\\" caused by man and that \\"burning less carbon is good planetary hygiene, and good practice generally.\\" He believes \\"we should be pursuing global warming remedies regardless of what you think about global warming.\\"Instapundit post, February 03, 2007 On the other hand, Reynolds occasionally brings up the topic of global cooling, referencing the science fiction novel, Fallen Angels.Instapundit post, May 27, 2013 He also frequently expresses mistrust at the motives of global warming proponents whose actions and positions seemingly run contrary to their rhetoric.http://pjmedia.com/instapundit/?s=%22i'll+believe+it's+a+crisis%22 One of his household vehicles is a hybrid SUV, and he has promoted hybrid technology in general‚Äîwhen he thought it was well-engineered. In October 2006, Reynolds was criticized heavily by Rush LimbaughInstapundit post , October 16, 2006 over several days for posting a \\"GOP Pre-mortem\\"Instapundit post , October 14, 2006 suggesting that the Republicans deserved to lose the 2006 Congressional elections. Reynolds often blogs in support of Porkbusters, which he helped create. He has vigorously criticized politicians from both parties for pork barrel spending and earmarking; then-Senator Trent Lott (R-Miss) once remarked that he was \\"damned tired\\" of the Porkbusters. Reynolds has stated in the past that earmarks and pork are not just a waste of money, but a corrupting influence on the political process. Reynolds has testified before Congressional committees on space law, international trade, and domestic terrorism. He has also served as executive chairman for the National Space Society, and was once a member of the White House Advisory Panel on Space Policy. In June 2009, Reynolds changed his blog header to the color green from its original red, in support of the anti-Ahmadinejad/pro-Mousavi protests made after the Iranian Presidential election. This was originally supposed to be a temporary show up support, but it lasted about three months. On September 7, 2009, Reynolds replaced the green with his customary red, remarking, \\"I‚Äôm back to the original design. 'Going Green' was supposed to be a show of support, not a permanent change, and the summer‚Äôs over. My support for the Iranian freedom movement is no less, but symbolism takes you only so far.\\"  Other writing  Reynolds is co-author of Outer Space: Problems of Law and Policy and The Appearance of Impropriety: How the Ethics Wars Have Undermined American Government, Business, and Society. He is also the author of An Army of Davids, a New York Times bestseller. The latter book appears to have a symbiotic relationship with his blog, inasmuch as it promotes the changing of society for the best through the efforts of individuals, seizing the initiative and empowered by technology and community. He expresses this sensibility frequently in his blog, remarking on occasion that humans work best as \\"a pack, not a herd.\\" Reynolds also writes articles for various publications (generally under his full name, Glenn Harlan Reynolds): Popular Mechanics, Forbes, The New York Post, The New York Times, The Atlantic Monthly, The Washington Post, The Washington Times, The Los Angeles Times, and The Wall Street Journal. He has written for the TCSDaily.com, Fox News, and MSNBC websites as well. Reynolds has a weekly opinion column in USA Today. As a law professor, Reynolds has written for the Columbia Law Review, the Virginia Law Review, the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, the Wisconsin Law Review, the Northwestern University Law Review, the Harvard Journal of Law and Technology, Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly, Law and Policy in International Business, Jurimetrics, and the High Technology Law Journal, among others. Influence on other bloggers Sometimes referred to as \\"the Blogfather, and credited with an \\"ethic of driving traffic to new blogs from all over the political spectrum,\\" Reynolds managed to attract a large following of imitators who adopted his blogging style. His ability to \\"foster a hospitable environment for new bloggers\\" has been attributed to his involvement in home-recording punk and new-wave music, and his adaptation of the participatory ethos of these musical styles to online publishing. In April 2002, Reynolds published a list of well over two hundred blogs that claimed to be directly inspired by his own. Instapundit's popularity led to the common adoption of the suffix \\"-pundit\\" in blog titles, for example Kevin Drum (who originally blogged as \\"CalPundit\\") and Allahpundit. There are also direct take-offs on the entire name, such as Instapunk, and IsntAPundit. There are many other \\"-pundit\\" blogs, of all political stripes inspired to some degree by Instapundit. Quotations Another way that Instapundit has been a major influence on other bloggers is a set of ironic titles that it repeats on many different posts. Many of these titles have become part of the conservative lexicon. Some examples: *\\"You want more Trump? This is how you get more Trump!\\" *\\"Why are Democrat-run cities such cesspits of corruption?\\" (where \\"cities\\" and \\"corruption\\" is replaced by whatever the story is about). *\\"They told me that if I voted for (Republican presidential candidate) I would see (terrible result) - and they were right!\\" (pointing to a story about where a Democratic president or politician did just that). *\\"Faster, please\\" (about some life-extending discovery). *\\"Higher education bubble update\\" (some indication that the current college system is collapsing). *\\"Think of them (i.e., the media) as Democratic operatives with bylines and it all makes sense.\\" *\\"I'm so old, I remember when...\\" (something that something or somebody claimed recently, but now is demonstrating just the opposite).

He is the sponsor of the large multi-academy trust the Harris Federation. Interests= Business  Harris is currently an advisor and shareholder of Tapi Carpets, a flooring retailer set up recently by a number of the old Carpetright management team. Harris was the Chairman of Carpetright plc and has over fifty years' experience in carpet retailing. Harris left Carpetright in 2014, sold all of his shares and he is no longer associated with the company. He was chairman and chief executive of Harris Carpets. Harris Carpets acquired Queensway in 1977 to become Harris Queensway plc until the company was taken over in 1988. Lord Harris was also a non-executive director of Great Universal Stores plc for 18 years, retiring from the GUS Board in July 2004. Lord Harris became a non-executive director of Matalan in October 2004. Football He was appointed to the board of Arsenal Football Club as a non-executive director in November 2005.

Lord Harris and Lord Kirkham bought the horse for an estimated ‚Ç¨2 million at the start of 2012. They are also co- owners of the horses Hello Sailor, Hello Unique and Hello Boyo. Politics=Conservative Party donations Harris has been a donor to the Tory Party since the 1980s and was a great admirer of Margaret Thatcher. He also made donations to David Cameron as leader of the Conservative Party. He is considered to be one of his personal friends. His ties to Cameron came under scrutiny two years later when it appeared that Andrew Feldman, a political associate of his and a fellow donor to Cameron's leadership campaign, used Harris's name to claim privileges accorded to active members of the House of Lords (which Harris, his peerage notwithstanding, had never been). A report in The Independent newspaper quoted a senior member of the Lords Privileges Committee as suggesting the allegation shows how fundraising \\"pollutes our politics\\".Independent  Comments on Theresa May  In a September 2017 interview with The Times he described Theresa May as very indecisive unlike Thatcher, hopeless during the general election campaign which she should have won easily, and was leading a weak directionless government. He said May was mishandling the Brexit negotiations and alienated many in the business community. He also said the government's funding cuts to schools had gone too far and were a false economy and that the free schools policy should be overhauled by the Department for Education so that they are only set up in areas of place shortages. Other comments made included his opposition to an expansion of grammar schools, Theresa May u-turning on too many decisions such as the so-called dementia tax, and the Home Office not reducing net migration to the tens of thousands as repeatedly promised. Harris spoke about potential candidates on who could succeed May as Conservative Party Leader. Harris Federation academies He has contributed extensively to education and as a result, many schools and colleges (such as Harris Manchester College, Oxford) bear his name. Through the Harris Federation, many secondary schools in South London have received Harris donations. In the London Borough of Croydon, he helped to found the Harris City Technology College, Harris Academy South Norwood and Harris Academy Merton, Harris Academy Purley, Harris Academy Chafford Hundred, Harris Academy Peckham although many local residents are angered that the original name of the Harris Girls Academy East Dulwich, Stanley Technical High School, was dropped in place of the Harris name. In recent years, the forced change to academy status has placed additional schools under the management of the Harris Federation despite considerable opposition from Boards of Governors and parents.

The eastern part of the river is bypassed, providing a more convenient south-north connection for large ships.,  History  The canal, approximately 12 km long and ten metres deep, was dug during the time of the German Empire between 1874 and 1880, during the reign of the first Kaiser Wilhelm (1797-1888). Thus it was not named after his grandson Kaiser Wilhelm II (1859-1941) who was famous for his interest in seafaring and battleships. Baptized as Kaiserfahrt (\\"Emperor's Way\\"), the canal allowed ships from the Baltic Sea to reach the industrial city of Szczecin more easily. The canal circumvented the eastern branch of the Swine river which was very difficult to navigate. The resulting benefit to shipping between the Baltic Sea and Szczecin (named Stettin under German rule) saw the ascendancy of the port of Stettin and a decline in the port of ≈öwinouj≈õcie (Swinem√ºnde in German), because now ocean-going ships could sail as far as Stettin. Another side effect was that the eastern part of the island Usedom was cut off, creating an island that was named after its largest village, Kaseburg (Karsib√≥r). On the other hand, the railway line, opened in 1875, from Berlin to Swinem√ºnde over the bridge near Karnin (blown up in 1945), helped to promote Swinem√ºnde and its neighbouring villages as seaside resorts. After World War II, the area became part of Poland under border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference, and the canal was renamed after the Piast dynasty - the first Polish royal dynasty. In October 2020 an unexploded Tallboy bomb from the attack on L√ºtzow was found in the Piast Canal (Kaiserfahrt during the war). After evacuating approximately 750 people who lived nearby, an attempt was undertaken to deflagrate it with a remote- controlled device, but it exploded, without casualties.[2]  Images  File:Kan Piast No1.jpgView of the canal from Szczecin Lagoon File:Piast Canal near Szczecin Lagoon.jpgView from Karsib√≥r Island File:Piast Kanal and Swina river.jpgPiast Canal diverges from ≈öwina river  External links  * Piast Canal pictures \\"WW2 'earthquake' bomb explodes in Poland during attempt to defuse it\\".

Education Pilkington was educated at Dame Allan's School, Newcastle where he came to faith and developed both his love of scholarship and his combative personality. In 1952 he went up to Jesus College, Cambridge and read history, being influenced by Conservative-minded figures such as Maurice Cowling, Herbert Butterfield and Michael Oakeshott. He graduated in 1955, and took his MA in 1959. Ecclesiastical career Pilkington trained for ordination at Westcott House, Cambridge, and was ordained as a deacon in the Diocese of Derby in 1959, and as a priest the following year. He served for three years as curate at the historic parish church of All Saints', Bakewell during the incumbency of George Sinker. He left parochial work to take up his first school chaplaincy position. In 1975 he was appointed an honorary canon of Canterbury Cathedral. Educational career In 1962 Pilkington became a schoolmaster at Eton College, teaching history, and a college chaplain. Later he became Conduct (senior chaplain), and for 10 years also served as Master in College, the housemaster of the scholars' house, until his resignation in 1975. He was Headmaster of The King's School, Canterbury from 1975 to 1986. His final appointment in education was the post of High Master of St Paul's School, London, from 1986 to 1992. Retirement Following his retirement from education Pilkington was appointed Chairman of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission, serving from 1992 to 1996. In 1995, he was made a life peer as Baron Pilkington of Oxenford, of West Dowlish in the County of Somerset.the Peerage.com He also assisted in retirement as an honorary curate of St Mary's, Bourne Street, a prominent Anglo-Catholic church in Pimlico, where he served from 1992 to 2005. Although his entire teaching career was spent in the private sector, Pilkington was a vociferous supporter of selective state education. During his retirement he served for several years as Chairman of the National Grammar Schools Association. Personal life In 1966 Pilkington married Helen Wilson, who predeceased him in 1997. He was survived by two daughters.

Garrett made contact with the spirit of Herbert Carmichael Irwin at a s√©ance held with Price at the National Laboratory of Psychical Research two days after the R101 disaster, while attempting to contact the then recently deceased Arthur Conan Doyle, and discussed possible causes of the accident.Melvin Harris.

Major Oliver Villiers, a friend of Brancker, Scott, Irwin, Colmore and others aboard the airship, participated in further s√©ances with Garrett, at which he claimed to have contacted both Irwin and other victims.

The magician John Booth analyzed the mediumship of Garrett and the paranormal claims of R101 and considered her to be a fraud.

The so-called secret information just doesn't exist.\\" Helen Duncan Helen Duncan with a roll of cheesecloth. In 1931, the National Laboratory of Psychical Research took on its most illustrious case. ¬£50 was paid to the medium Helen Duncan so that she could be examined under scientific conditions.Simeon Edmunds. (1966). Spiritualism: A Critical Survey. Aquarian Press. pp. 137-144 Price was skeptical of Duncan and had her perform a number of test s√©ances. She was suspected of swallowing cheesecloth which was then regurgitated as \\"ectoplasm\\".Harry Price. (1931). Regurgitation and the Duncan Mediumship. (Bulletin I of the National Laboratory of Psychical Research, 120pp with 44 illustrations.) Price had proven through analysis of a sample of ectoplasm produced by Duncan, that it was made of cheesecloth.Marina Warner. (2008). Phantasmagoria: Spirit Visions, Metaphors, and Media into the Twenty-first Century. Oxford University Press. p. 299. Duncan reacted violently at attempts to X-ray her, running from the laboratory and making a scene in the street, where her husband had to restrain her, destroying the controlled nature of the test. Price wrote that Duncan had given her fake ectoplasm to her husband to hide.Paul Tabori. (1966). Harry Price: The Biography of a Ghosthunter. Living books. p. 136 The ectoplasm of Duncan in another test was analyzed by psychical researchers to be made from egg white. According to Price: > The sight of half-a-dozen men, each with a pair of scissors waiting for the > word, was amusing. It came and we all jumped. One of the doctors got hold of > the stuff and secured a piece. The medium screamed and the rest of the > \\"teleplasm\\" went down her throat. This time it wasn't cheese-cloth. It > proved to be paper, soaked in white of egg, and folded into a flattened > tube... Could anything be more infantile than a group of grown-up men > wasting time, money, and energy on the antics of a fat female crook. Price wrote up the case in Leaves from a Psychist‚Äôs Case Book (1933) in a chapter called \\"The Cheese-Cloth Worshippers\\".Harry Price. (1933). The Cheese- Cloth Worshippers in Leaves from a Psychist‚Äôs Case Book. Gollancz. pp. 201‚Äì209. Price in his report published photographs of Duncan in his laboratory that revealed fake ectoplasm made from cheesecloth, rubber gloves and cut-out heads from magazine covers which she pretended to her audience were spirits.Paul Kurtz. (1985). A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology. Prometheus Books. p. 599. Following the report written by Price, Duncan's former maid Mary McGinlay confessed in detail to having aided Duncan in her mediumship tricks, and Duncan's husband admitted that the ectoplasm materializations to be the result of regurgitation. Later Duncan was caught cheating again pretending to be a spirit in the s√©ance room. During Duncan's famous trial in 1944, Price gave his results as evidence for the prosecution. This time Duncan and her traveling companions, Frances Brown, Ernest and Elizabeth Homer were prosecuted and convicted. Duncan was jailed for nine months, Brown for four months and the Homers were bound over.Helena Normanton. (1945). The Trial of Mrs. Duncan. Edited with a Foreword by C. E. Bechhofer Roberts.

Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 806 Rudi claimed he could levitate objects but according to Price a photograph taken on April 28, 1932 showed that Rudi had managed to free his arm to move a handkerchief from the table. After this, many scientists considered Rudi to be exposed as a fraud.Harry Price. (2003). Fifty Years of Psychical Research. Kessinger Publishing. (reprint) Price wrote that the findings of the other experiments should be revised due to the evidence showing how Rudi could free himself from the controls. After Price had exposed Rudi, various scientists such Karl Przibram and the magician Henry Evans wrote to Price telling him that they agreed that Rudi would evade control during his s√©ances and congratulated Price on the success of unmasking the fraud.Paul Tabori.

Mother of King √Üthelred the Unready, she was a powerful political figure. She was possibly linked to the murder of her stepson King Edward the Martyr and appeared as a stereotypical bad queen and evil stepmother in many medieval histories. Early life √Ülfthryth was the daughter of Ealdorman Ordgar. Her mother was a member of the royal family of Wessex. The family's power lay in the west of Wessex. Ordgar was buried in Exeter and his son Ordwulf founded, or refounded, Tavistock Abbey.Stafford, Unification, pp. 52-53. √Ülfthryth was first married to √Üthelwald, son of √Üthelstan Half-King as recorded by Byrhtferth of Ramsey in his Life of Saint Oswald of Worcester.PASE; Stafford, Unification, pp. 52-53. Later accounts, such as that preserved by William of Malmesbury, add vivid detail of unknown reliability. According to William, the beauty of Ordgar's daughter √Ülfthryth was reported to King Edgar. Edgar, looking for a Queen, sent √Üthelwald to see √Ülfthryth, ordering him \\"to offer her marriage [to Edgar] if her beauty were really equal to report.\\" When she turned out to be just as beautiful as was said, √Üthelwald married her himself and reported back to Edgar that she was quite unsuitable. Edgar was eventually told of this, and decided to repay √Üthelwald's betrayal in like manner. He said that he would visit the poor woman, which alarmed √Üthelwald. He asked √Ülfthryth to make herself as unattractive as possible for the king's visit, but she did the opposite. Edgar, quite besotted with her, killed √Üthelwald during a hunt.Malmesbury, pp. 139-140 (Book 2, ¬ß 139. The historical record does not record the year of √Üthelwald's death, let alone its manner. No children of √Üthelwald and √Ülfthryth are known. Queenship Edgar had two children before he married √Ülfthryth, both of uncertain legitimacy. Edward was probably the son of √Üthelfl√¶d, and Eadgifu, later known as Saint Edith of Wilton, was the daughter of Wulfthryth.Cyril Hart, Edward the Martyr, Oxford Online DNB, 2004 Sound political reasons encouraged the match between Edgar, whose power base was centred in Mercia, and √Ülfthryth, whose family were powerful in Wessex. In addition to this, and her link with the family of √Üthelstan Half-King, √Ülfthryth also appears to have been connected to the family of √Ülfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia.Higham, pp. 6-7; Stafford, Unification, pp. 52-53. Edgar married √Ülfthryth in either 964 or 965. In 966 √Ülfthryth gave birth to a son who was named Edmund. In King Edgar's charter (S 745) regranting privileges to New Minster, Winchester that same year, the infant Edmund is called \\"clito legitimus\\" (legitimate √¶theling), and appears before Edward in the list of witnesses. Edmund died young, circa 970, but in 968 √Ülfthryth had given birth to a second son who was called √Üthelred.Higham, pp. 6-7; Miller, \\"Edgar\\"; Stafford, \\"√Ülfthryth\\". King Edgar organised a second coronation on 11 May 973 at Bath, perhaps to bolster his claim to be ruler of all of Britain. Here √Ülfthryth was also crowned and anointed, granting her a status higher than any recent queen.Miller, \\"Edgar\\"; Stafford, \\"√Ülfthryth\\". The only model of a queen's coronation was that of Judith of Flanders, but this had taken place outside England. In the new rite, the emphasis lay on her role as protector of religion and the nunneries in the realm. She took a close interest in the well-being of several abbeys, and as overseer of Barking Abbey she deposed and later reinstated the abbess. √Ülfthryth played a large role as forespeca, or advocate, in at least seven legal cases. As such, she formed a key part of the Anglo-Saxon legal system as a mediator between the individual and the crown, which was increasingly viewing its role in the courts as a symbol of its authority as protector of its subjects. √Ülfthryth's actions as forespeca were largely for the benefit of female litigants, and her role as a mediator shows the possibilities for women to have legal and political power in late Anglo- Saxon England.Rabin, Andrew. \\"Female Advocacy and Royal Protection in Tenth- Century England: The Legal Career of Queen √Ülfthryth.\\" Speculum 84 (2009): 261‚Äì288. Queen dowager Edward the Martyr is offered a cup of mead by √Ülfthryth, wife of Edgar, unaware that her attendant is about to murder him. Edgar died in 975 leaving two young sons, Edward and √Üthelred. Edward was almost an adult, and his successful claim for the throne was supported by many key figures including Archbishops Dunstan and Oswald and the brother of √Ülfthryth's first husband, √Üthelwine, Ealdorman of East Anglia. Supporting the unsuccessful claim of √Üthelred were his mother, the Queen dowager, Bishop √Üthelwold of Winchester, and √Ülfhere, Ealdorman of Mercia.Higham, pp. 7-14; Stafford, Unification, pp. 57-59. On 18 March 978, while visiting √Ülfthryth at Corfe Castle, King Edward was killed by servants of the Queen, leaving the way clear for √Üthelred to be installed as king. Edward was soon considered a martyr, and later medieval accounts blamed √Ülfthryth for his murder. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, King Edward was murdered at Corfe Castle in 978. As the king developed into a cult figure, a body of literature grew up around his murder, at first implying and then accusing his step-mother, Queen Aelfthryth, of being responsible. The 12th century monastic chronicle the Liber Eliensis went so far as to accuse her of being a witch, claiming that she had murdered not only the king, but also Abbot Brihtnoth of Ely.* Due to √Üthelred's youth, √Ülfthryth served as regent for her son until his coming of age in 984. By then her earlier allies √Üthelwold and √Ülfhere had died, and √Üthelred rebelled against his old advisers, preferring a group of younger nobility. She disappears from the list of charter witnesses from around 983 to 993, when she reappears in a lower position. She remained an important figure, being responsible for the care of √Üthelred's children by his first wife, √Ülfgifu. √Üthelred's eldest son, √Üthelstan √Ütheling, prayed for the soul of the grandmother \\"who brought me up\\" in his will in 1014.Higham, pp. 7-14; Stafford, \\"√Ülfthryth\\"; Stafford, Unification, pp. 57-59, Lavelle, pp. 86-90 Although her reputation was damaged by the murder of her stepson, √Ülfthryth was a religious woman, taking an especial interest in monastic reform when Queen. In about 986 she founded Wherwell Abbey in Hampshire as a Benedictine nunnery, and late in life she retired there. Antonia Gransden comments: \\"In their patronage of the monks both Cnut and Edward the Confessor were supported by their queens, Emma and Edith, who were worthy successors of Edgar's queen, √Ülfthryth, as patronesses of the religious.\\"Gransden, Legends, p. 58 She died at Wherwell on 17 November 999, 1000 or 1001.Stafford, \\"√Ülfthryth\\" NotesReferences * * Higham, Nick, The Death of Anglo-Saxon England.

The Z model had just entered production when France fell to the Germans during World War II. A small number were produced during the war but the German occupation government would not allow full-scale production to start. After the war small numbers were built to equip new designs, but the rapid introduction of the jet engine ended further development. Design and development The 12Z differed from the earlier 12Y primarily in the use of four valves per cylinder operated by dual overhead cams, as opposed to two valves operated by a single camshaft. This gave the cylinders considerably better volumetric efficiency and faster operation, raising the RPM from 2,400 to 2,700. The engine was also designed to run only on 100 octane fuel (instead of 87, which was common at that point) which allowed the compression ratio to rise from the 12Y's 5.8:1 to the 12Z's 6.75:1. These changes raised the power from 1,000 to 1,300 hp (750 to 970 kW) at sea level. The engine continued to use a single-stage, single-speed supercharger and therefore lacked the all-altitude performance of German and British designs. But tuning the supercharger for a different critical altitude improved high-altitude performance considerably, delivering 1,500 hp (1,120 kW) at as opposed to 930 hp (690 kW) at for the 12Y. Small prototype runs started in 1939, and were fitted to the French Air Force's front-line fighter aircraft, the M.S.410 and D.520, creating the M.S.450 and D.524 respectively. Production of the main model, the 12Z-17, was just starting at the time of the armistice. Production was undertaken in Hispano-Suiza's Spanish factories where they were intended for the Hispano Aviaci√≥n HA-1112 - only a few were ever used, however, because of mechanical problems with the engine. After the war a new version tuned to operate with 92 octane fuel, as opposed to the -17's 100/130, was built in limited numbers as the 12Z-89. Compression ratio was raised slightly to 7:1, but with the lower grade fuel the power dropped slightly to 1,280 hp (950 kW) at 2,600 rpm (1,479 hp (1,100 kW) maximum take- off).

The founder of Pretoria, Marthinus Pretorius, determined that the square be used as a market place and church yard. It was subsequently named for the church buildings that stood at the centre of the square from 1856 to 1905. The square's most prominent feature, since June 1954, is however the statue of the late Boer leader and president of the South African Republic, Paul Kruger, at its centre. Statues of four anonymous Boer citizen-soldiers surround that of Kruger on a lower level of the plinth. Current buildings Several historically and architecturally significant buildings surround the square: the Palace of Justice, the Old Capitol Theatre, the Tudor Chambers, the Ou Raadsaal (Old Council Chamber) and the General Post Office, which was designed by William Hawke. 2014 revamping project In keeping with the historical value of the square, a rejuvenation project was announced in 2014 in the old Raadsaal. Roads around the square would be converted for exclusive use by the A Re Yeng (\\"Let's Go\\") bus service and its service vehicles, while pedestrian areas would be made more public-friendly. The defunct south wall‚Äôs fountain head would be restored and trees would be planted around the square. Numerous street benches would be provided and the square's tar walkways would be replaced with slate. The Kruger statues at the centre of the square would remain, and the square will be closed for hawkers. History=Market Produce was conveyed to the Market Square by wagon, where their owners' oxen were also outspanned. The produce, if not sold direct from the wagon, would be placed on the ground amidst the trek oxen and the cattle and horses for sale. A first market shed was erected by the municipality after 1910 which led to a legal battle between the Pretoria Market and Estate Company and the town council. This was finally decided by Lord de Villiers at Bloemfontein, whose verdict gave the council control over 3/4 of the square, while the Market and Estate Company retained control of the Market Hall and buildings on the square's north-western corner for about another 40 years. The building of further sheds and the paving of the Market Square c.1917 were consequences of Lord de Villiers' verdict. Lines for horse-drawn trams initially connected the railway station with Market, Church, du Toit and Esselen streets to the terminus at the east end of de Kock Street. This company ceased operations at the outbreak of war in 1899, and it was not until c.1904 that the municipality purchased their concession and restarted it. Only in November 1910 were electric trams put into operation. Churches The square became known as Church Square due to a succession of three churches that stood at the center of the square. The first church on Church Square was built in 1856 by Skinner and Devereux, and inaugurated in 1857. This was replaced by a larger building, which burnt down in 1882. This simple Cape Dutch style building was replaced by an early Gothic style building, built by Claridge, together with Leslie Simmonds. This third church building, known as the Verenigde Kerk, was demolished in 1904/1905, shortly after president Paul Kruger's state funeral was conducted from it. Fountain According to a Minute of His Worship the Mayor (Andrew Johnson) for the Mayoral Year ending 25th October 1905, Municipality of Pretoria, a fountain was proposed for the square by Mr. Samuel Marks. This piece in turn was moved to the Pretoria Zoo, making way for the current collection of sculptures. Rivonia trial The turreted Palace of Justice was the scene of arguably the most famous political trial in South Africa's history, the Rivonia Trial. During this trial, Nelson Mandela and a number of other ANC members were charged with treason, found guilty and subsequently incarcerated.

It was created in 1815 for John Parker, 2nd Baron Boringdon. At the same time he was created Viscount Boringdon, of North Molton in the County of Devon, which is used as a courtesy title by the heir apparent to the earldom. It does not seem to have any connection with Baron Morley of Morley in Norfolk, held by another Parker family in the 16th century. Appellation of Morley There existed between 1299 and 1697 an ancient Barony of Morley first held by the de Morley family, lords of the manor of Morley Saint Botolph in Norfolk, which passed in 1489 by marriage to the Parker family, apparently unrelated to the Parker family of Saltram, Devon which latter had emerged in the 16th century from seemingly humble origins in North Molton in Devon. It can thus be no co-incidence that in 1815 John Parker, 2nd Baron Boringdon (1772‚Äì1840), on his elevation to the dignity of an earl in 1815, chose the title Earl of Morley, ostensibly referring to his recent purchase of the relatively minor Devon manor of Morley1810 Additions to Tristram Risdon's \\"Survey of Devon\\", p.386: \\"The manor of Morley did belong to John Shapleigh, Esq., who sold it to John Seale, of Mount Boon, Esq., from whom it was purchased by Lord Boringdon, the present proprietor\\" (modern spelling Moreleigh), midway between Totnes and Kingsbridge. It had become common in the 19th century for members of the post-mediaeval nobility when elevated further in the peerage to adopt defunct mediaeval titles which bore some ostensible link to the family, thus lending it an air of great antiquity. Such actions were often adopted in all innocence based on erroneous pedigrees produced by genealogists overly eager to please their patrons.e.g. Wiffen, the librarian at Woburn of the Duke of Bedford, who produced a pedigree of the Russells containing a fabricated link to the mediaeval Russell family of Kingston Russell An example is the Russell family, Dukes of Bedford, of which a younger son when himself elevated to the peerage adopted the title \\"Baron Russell of Kingston Russell\\", an ancient Dorset manor with which his family had in fact no historic connection.Scott-Thomson, Gladys, F.R.H.S. Two Centuries of Family History, London, 1930. (A study of the Bedford Russell early pedigree). Several similar mis-appropriations of lineages of ancient families are given in this work. Baron Boringdon impaling Mayhew of Boringdon: Gules, a chevron vair between three ducal crowns or.Burke's General Armory, 1884 Escutcheon on granite fireplace, great hall, Boringdon Hall, showing Parker arms, 1640 The title of Baron Boringdon, of Boringdon in the County of Devon, was created in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1784 for the first earl's father, John Parker, who had previously represented Bodmin and Devon in the House of Commons. Lord Morley was succeeded by his only son, the second Earl. He held minor office in the first Whig administration of Lord John Russell. His son, the third Earl, was a Liberal politician and notably served under William Ewart Gladstone as Under-Secretary of State for War and as First Commissioner of Works. His grandson, the sixth Earl, succeeded his uncle in 1962 (who in his turn had succeeded his elder brother in 1951). He was the eldest son of the Hon. John Holford Parker, third and youngest son of the third Earl. Lord Morley served as Lord Lieutenant of Devon from 1982 to 1998. He was succeeded by his only son in 2015. The family seat was Saltram House in Plymouth. It was sold to the National Trust in 1957 and remained the family seat until the fifth Earl died in 1962.

The term is also used in other engineering contexts, such as hydraulic pumps and electronic components. Internal combustion engines Volumetric efficiency in an internal combustion engine design refers to the efficiency with which the engine can move the charge of fuel and air into and out of the cylinders. It also denotes the ratio of air volume drawn into the cylinder to the cylinder's swept volume.Internal Combustion Engines 3rd edition Ferguson , Kirkpatrick- Publisher John Wiley and Sons, 2016 More specifically, volumetric efficiency is a ratio (or percentage) of the mass of air and fuel that is trapped by the cylinder during induction divided by the mass that would occupy the displaced volume if the air density in the cylinder were equal to the ambient air density. The flow restrictions in the intake system create a pressure drop in the inlet flow which reduces the density (unless boosts like turbos or superchargers or cam tuning techniques are used). Volumetric efficiency can be improved in a number of ways, most effectively this can be achieved by compressing the induction charge (forced induction) or by aggressive cam phasing in naturally aspirated engines as seen in racing applications. In the case of forced induction volumetric efficiency can exceed 100%. There are several ways to improve volumetric efficiency, but system-wide approaches are used to realize its full potential. Many high performance cars use carefully arranged air intakes and tuned exhaust systems that use pressure waves to push air into and out of the cylinders, making use of the resonance of the system. Two-stroke engines are very sensitive to this concept and can use expansion chambers that return the escaping air-fuel mixture back to the cylinder. A more modern technique for four-stroke engines, variable valve timing, attempts to address changes in volumetric efficiency with changes in speed of the engine: at higher speeds the engine needs the valves open for a greater percentage of the cycle time to move the charge in and out of the engine. Volumetric efficiencies above 100% can be reached by using forced induction such as supercharging or turbocharging. With proper tuning, volumetric efficiencies above 100% can also be reached by naturally aspirated engines. The limit for naturally aspirated engines is about 130%; these engines are typically of a DOHC layout with four valves per cylinder. This process is called inertial supercharging and uses the resonance of the intake manifold and the mass of the air to achieve pressures greater than atmospheric at the intake valve. With proper tuning (and dependent on the need for sound level control), VE's of up to 130% have been reported in various experimental studies.SAE 860032 \\"Optimization of multi valve four cycle engine design\\" More \\"radical\\" solutions include the sleeve valve design, in which the valves are replaced outright with a rotating sleeve around the piston, or alternately a rotating sleeve under the cylinder head. In this system the ports can be as large as necessary, up to that of the entire cylinder wall. However, there is a practical upper limit due to the strength of the sleeve, at larger sizes the pressure inside the cylinder can \\"pop\\" the sleeve if the port is too large. Hydraulic pumps Volumetric efficiency in a hydraulic pump refers to the percentage of actual fluid flow out of the pump compared to the flow out of the pump without leakage. In other words, if the flow out of a 100cc pump is 92cc (per revolution), then the volumetric efficiency is 92%. The volumetric efficiency will change with the pressure and speed a pump is operated at, therefore when comparing volumetric efficiencies, the pressure and speed information must be available. When a single number is given for volumetric efficiency, it will typically be at the rated pressure and speed. Electronics Capacitor volumetric efficiency increased from 1970 to 2005 (click image to enlarge) In electronics, volumetric efficiency quantifies the performance of some electronic function per unit volume, usually in as small a space as possible. This is desirable since advanced designs need to cram increasing functionality into smaller packages, for example, maximizing the energy stored in a battery powering a cellphone. Besides energy storage in batteries, the concept of volumetric efficiency appears in design and application of capacitors, where the \\"CV product\\" is a figure of merit calculated by multiplying the capacitance (C) by the maximum voltage rating (V), divided by the volume. The concept of volumetric efficiency can be applied to any measurable electronic characteristic, including resistance, capacitance, inductance, voltage, current, energy storage, etc. See also *Two-stroke power valve system *Variable compression ratio NotesExternal links * 2 Stroke Tuned Pipe (Expansion Chamber) Design Software Category:Engine technology Category:Two-stroke engine technology Category:Engineering ratios ","title":"Volumetric efficiency"},{"id":"469325","text":"Judith Ann Wilcox, Baroness Wilcox (n√©e Freeman; born 31 October 1939) is a businesswoman and a Conservative Life Peer in the British House of Lords.

It is Japan's oldest major movie studio, founded in 1912 during the silent film era. The name Nikkatsu amalgamates the words Nippon Katsud≈ç Shashin, literally \\"Japan Motion Pictures\\". Shareholders are Nippon Television Holdings (35%) and SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation (28.4%). History=Founding in 1912 Nikkatsu was founded on September 10, 1912, when several production companies and theater chains, Yoshizawa Sh≈çten, Yokota Sh≈çkai, Fukuh≈çd≈ç and M. Pathe, consolidated under the name Nippon Katsud≈ç Shashin. The company enjoyed its share of success. It employed such notable film directors as Shozo Makino and his son Masahiro Makino. During World War II, the government ordered the ten film companies that had formed by 1941 to consolidate into two. Daiei founder Masaichi Nagata, a former Nikkatsu employee, counter-proposed that three companies be formed and the suggestion was approved. Nikkatsu, set to merge with the two weakest companies, Shink≈ç Kinema and Daito, were verbally displeased. The committee formed to establish the value of each company retaliated by purposefully undervaluing Nikkatsu, which led to Shink≈ç becoming the dominant head of production. The reformed Nikkatsu continued to prosper as an exhibition company but ceased all film production. The postwar film industry expanded rapidly and, in 1951, Nikkatsu president Kyusaku Hori began construction of a new production studio. A graduate of Tokyo Keizai University, Hori had joined the company in 1951 after quitting his initial employment as the manager of Sanno Hotel (now rebuilt as Sanno Park Tower). Golden Age Under Hori, Nikkatsu is considered to have had its \\"Golden Age\\". The company began making movies again in 1954. Many assistant directors from other studios, including Sh≈çhei Imamura and Seijun Suzuki from Shochiku, moved to Nikkatsu with the promise of advancement to full director status within one or two years. Suzuki made dozens of films for Nikkatsu from 1956 onwards, developing an increasingly inventive visual style, but was controversially fired following the release of his 40th, Branded to Kill (1967), which Hori deemed \\"incomprehensible\\". The company made a few samurai films and historical dramas but by 1960 had decided to devote its resources to the production of urban youth dramas, comedy, action and gangster films. From the late 1950s to the start of the 1970s, they were renowned for their \\"borderless action\\" (mukokuseki akushun) movies, designed for the youth market, whose directors included Suzuki, Toshio Masuda, and Takashi Nomura. The studio also employed such stars as Yujiro Ishihara, Akira Kobayashi, Joe Shishido, Tetsuya Watari, Ruriko Asaoka, Chieko Matsubara and, later, Meiko Kaji and Tatsuya Fuji. Director Sh≈çhei Imamura began his career there and between 1958 and 1966 made for them such notable films as Pigs and Battleships (1961), The Insect Woman (1963) and The Pornographers (1966). Strangely during the height of the popularity of Japan's daikaiju (giant monster) genre, Nikkatsu only produced one Godzilla-type monster movie, Daikyoju Gappa (Giant Beast Gappa), released internationally as Gappa: The Triphibian Monster and Monster From a Prehistoric Planet, a film generally regarded as a remake of the 1961 British film Gorgo (1961).Galbraith,Stuart (1994). Japanese Fantasy, Science Fiction and Horror Films. McFarland and Co., Inc. Pink films By 1971 the increased popularity of television had taken a heavy toll on the film industry and in order to remain profitable Nikkatsu turned to the production of Roman Porno (from the French word 'roman' for 'novel' and the English word 'porno') and pinku eiga or pink films, which focus on sex, violence, S&M; and romance. Hori resigned over the change in focus, and many stars and directors left the company. A few, including the film directors Yasuharu Hasebe, Keiichi Ozawa, Sh≈çgor≈ç Nishimura, and Koreyoshi Kurahara, stayed. It also witnessed the emergence of such new directors as Tatsumi Kumashiro, Masaru Konuma and Ch≈´sei Sone. Between 1974 and 1986, Nikkatsu promoted a number of their leading Roman Porno actresses of the popular BDSM niche under the epithet . They include Naomi Tani (1974‚Äì1979), Junko Mabuki (1980‚Äì1981), Izumi Shima (1982‚Äì1983), Nami Matsukawa (1983), Miki Takakura (1983‚Äì1985), and Ran Masaki (1985-1986). The advent of home video brought an end to active production at Nikkatsu. Bed Partner (1988) was the last release in the venerable 17-year Roman Porno series. Nikkatsu declared bankruptcy in 1993. Sushi Typhoon In 2005, the company was sold to Index Holdings and in 2010, a revived Nikkatsu studio announced new production of Sushi Typhoon, a movie series made in partnership with a U.S. distributor.

She was also known for discovering that the damage caused to patients by the rare metabolic disease oQ- betalipoproteinaemia could be avoided by the use of Vitamin E. She was also known for discovering the role of lipid metabolism in health and disease in childhood, which was original and difficult to investigate at that time. Early life and education Lloyd was born in Gilgit, Kashmir, where her father was a Major in the Royal Indian Army Service Corps. She remained in India until 1936, when her family returned to England. She was educated at the Royal High School in Bath, where she became head girl. She read medicine at the University of Bristol, winning honours with distinction and a gold medal. Career She joined the Royal College of Physicians in 1954. After further study in South Shields, Bristol, Plymouth, Oxford, Manchester and Durham, she became research assistant to Otto Herbert Wolff in Birmingham. She taught at the University of Birmingham from 1958 to 1965, specialising in metabolic disorders in children, particularly diabetes mellitus and childhood obesity. In 1965, she followed Wolff to Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, and the associated Institute of Child Health at University College London where she became a senior lecturer, later a reader and finally professor. Lloyd was appointed professor of child health and head of a new department of paediatrics at St George's Hospital Medical School in London in 1975, and returned to Great Ormond Street in 1985 as Nuffield Professor of Child Health. She served with distinction on many committees. She was the first female president of the British Paediatric Association from 1988 to 1991, and was a vice-president of the Royal College of Physicians from 1992 to 1995. Establishment of the RCPCH Lloyd retired from practising medicine in 1992, but played a role in transforming the British Paediatric Association (abbr. BPA) into the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. It was oriinally thought that Lloyd would become president of the BPA, after being honorary secretary for a number of years, but Lloyd believed that the paediatricians should have their own college. She was a member of an influential group with the BPA, which enabled her to push for the establishment of a new college. It was a contentious issue, as many in the profession believed it was not necessary, and there was serious differences of opinion, when looking in hindsight Sir Peter Tizard and his research group at Hammersmith Hospital, were one group of dissenting voices, who believed that Paediatrics should have the same intellectual footing for medicine for children, as medicine for adults, within general medicine, rather than a speciality. However, it was thanks to her, and people like the great Otto Wolff and Roy Meadow who were aligned with her ideal that the argument was won. Roy Meadow would become the first president, but she would feature on the coat of arms of the new college, in which she is a supporter holding a staff of Aesculapius entwined with a double helix rather than the traditional snake. The other supporter was Thomas Phaire, whose Boke of Chyldren from 1545 was the first book on paediatrics in English, the crest is a baby, taken from the arms of the Foundling Hospital in Coram's Fields. Lloyd took over responsibility for training and standards for paediatricians that had previously been under the control of the Royal College of Physicians.

It has the subsidiary title Baron Eliot. The family seat is Port Eliot. Heraldic achievement of Eliot, Earls of St Germans Port Eliot, St Germans - the Eliot family seat History Edward Eliot represented St Germans, Liskeard and Cornwall in the House of Commons and served as a commissioner of the Board of Trade and Plantations. He was the son of Richard Eliot (died 1748) and his wife Harriot, illegitimate daughter of James Craggs the Younger by his mistress, the noted actress Hester Santlow. In 1784 he was created Baron Eliot, of St Germans in the County of Cornwall, in the Peerage of Great Britain. In 1789 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname of Craggs. However, this surname has not been used by any of his descendants. Lord Eliot's second but eldest surviving son, Edward James Eliot, pre-deceased him, and he was succeeded by his third son, John Eliot, 2nd Baron Eliot. In 1815 he was created Earl of St Germans with remainder to his younger brother the Hon. William Eliot and the heirs male of his body. He had earlier represented Liskeard in Parliament. William, the second Earl, was a diplomat and politician, having notably served as Parliamentary Under- Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. His only son, the third Earl, was also a prominent politician and held ministerial office as Chief Secretary for Ireland, Postmaster General, Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland and Lord Steward of the Household. His third but eldest surviving son, the fourth Earl, was in the Diplomatic Service and briefly represented Devonport in the House of Commons. In 1870 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Eliot. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. Henry, the fifth Earl, was in the Foreign Office for many years. This line of the family failed on the death of his second but eldest surviving son, the sixth Earl, in 1922. The late Earl was succeeded by his first cousin, the seventh Earl. He was the eldest son of Colonel the Hon. Charles George Cornwallis Eliot, sixth son of the third Earl. He never married and was succeeded by his younger brother, the eighth Earl. He held several positions at court, notably as Gentleman Usher to King Edward VII and King George V. the titles are held by the eleventh Earl, who succeeded his grandfather in 2016.

It is one of two species assigned to the genus Mandrillus, along with the drill. Both the mandrill and the drill were once classified as baboons in the genus Papio, but they now have their own genus, Mandrillus. Although they look superficially like baboons, they are more closely related to Cercocebus mangabeys. Mandrills are found in southern Cameroon, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and Congo. Mandrills mostly live in tropical rainforest and in very large groups. Mandrills have an omnivorous diet consisting mostly of fruits and insects. Their mating season peaks in July to September, with a corresponding birth peak in December to April. Mandrills are the world's largest monkeys. The mandrill is classified as vulnerable by IUCN. Description Mandrill skull (Mus√©um de Toulouse) A skeleton of mandrill The mandrill has an olive green or dark grey pelage with yellow and black bands and a white belly. Its hairless face has an elongated muzzle with distinctive characteristics, such as a red stripe down the middle and protruding blue ridges on the sides. It also has red nostrils and lips, a yellow beard and white tufts. The areas around the genitals and the anus are multi-colored, being red, pink, blue, scarlet, and purple. They also have pale pink ischial callosities. The coloration of the animal is more pronounced in dominant adult males. Both sexes have chest glands, which are used in olfactory communication. These, too, are more prominent in dominant adult males. Males also have longer canines than females, which can be up to and 1.0 cm, respectively. The mandrill is one of the most sexually dimorphic mammals due to extremely strong sexual selection which favors males in both size and coloration. Males typically weigh , with an average mass of . Females weigh roughly half as much as the male, at and an average of . Exceptionally large males can weigh up to , with unconfirmed reports of outsized mandrills weighing per the Guinness Book of World Records.Mandrill. WAZA ‚Äì World Association of Zoos and Aquariums ‚Äì Virtual Zoo.Comparative Mammalian Brain Collections: Mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx). Brainmuseum.org. Retrieved on 2012-08-21. The mandrill is the heaviest living monkey, somewhat surpassing even the largest baboons such as chacma baboon and olive baboons in average weight even considering its more extreme sexual dimorphism, but the mandrill averages both shorter in the length and height at the shoulder than these species. The average male is long and the female is , with the short tail adding another . The shoulder height while on all fours can range from in females and in males. Compared to the largest baboons, the mandrill is more ape-like in structure, with a muscular and compact build, shorter, thicker limbs that are longer in the front and almost no tail.Burnie D and Wilson DE (Eds.), Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife. DK Adult (2005), Kingdon, Jonathan Kingdon Guide to African Mammals (1993) Mandrills can live up to 31 years in captivity. Females reach sexual maturity at about 3.5 years. Coloration Close-up of a male mandrill's colorful face Mandrills are noted as being exceptionally colorful by mammalian standards. Charles Darwin wrote in The Descent of Man: \\"no other member in the whole class of mammals is colored in so extraordinary a manner as the adult male mandrill's\\". The bright colors of mandrills are indeed not produced conventionally (no mammal is known to have red and blue pigments), being derived from light diffraction in facial collagen fibers. Ecology and activities Mandrill trekking in forest The mandrill is found primarily in southern Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Congo, and Gabon. Their range may also include Nigeria. Its distribution is bounded by the Sanaga River to the north and the Ogoou√© and White Rivers to the east. Recent research suggests that mandrill populations north and south of the Ogoou√© river are so genetically different as to be separate subspecies. Mandrills live in tropical rainforests. They also live in gallery forests adjacent to savannas, as well as rocky forests, riparian forests, cultivated areas and flooded forests and stream beds. Mandrills will cross grass areas within their forest habitats. The mandrill is an omnivore. It usually consumes plants, of which it eats over a hundred species. It prefers to eat fruits, but will also eat leaves, lianas, bark, stems, and fibers. It also consumes mushrooms and soil. Carnivorously, mandrills mostly eat invertebrates, particularly ants, beetles, termites, crickets, spiders, snails, and scorpions. It will also eat eggs, and even vertebrates such as birds, tortoises, frogs, porcupines, rats, and shrews. Mandrills likely will eat larger vertebrates when they have the opportunity, such as juvenile bay duikers and other small antelope. Large prey are likely killed with a bite to the nape with the mandrill's long canines. One study found the mandrill's diet was composed of fruit (50.7%), seeds (26.0%), leaves (8.2%), pith (6.8%), flowers (2.7%), and animal foods (4.1%), with other foods making up the remaining (1.4%). Mandrills are preyed on mainly by leopards. Additional predators known to attack both adult and young mandrills include crowned eagles and African rock pythons. They may be bitten and killed by Boomslangs when they accidentally rouse the venomous snake. It is thought that most predators are a threat mainly to young mandrills, with the likelihood of predation decreasing in adult females and especially adult males, which may be invulnerable to all but the seldom ambush by a leopard. In a study where a mandrill troop was exposed to stimuli relating to their natural predators, only the leopard caused the larger part of the group to flee into trees. However, the large, dominant males were observed to remain in response to the images of the natural predators, even the leopard, and pace back and forth while baring their teeth, generally indicating aggression and the defensive role they may play in such circumstances.Feistner, A. T. (1989). The behaviour of a social group of mandrills, Mandrillus sphinx. Mandrills are mostly terrestrial but they are more arboreal than baboons and feed as high as the canopy. When on the ground, mandrills walk by digitigrade quadrupedalism (walking on the toes of all four limbs). When in the trees, they often move by lateral jumps. Mandrills are mostly diurnal, with activities extending from morning to evening. They sleep in trees at a different site each night. Mandrills have been observed using tools; in captivity, mandrills have been observed using sticks to clean themselves. Social behavior and reproduction At Augsburg Zoo, Augsburg Mandrills seem to live in very large, stable groups named 'hordes'. A horde can number in the hundreds of mandrills, possibly averaging around 615 individuals and reaching as many as 845. It is difficult to accurately estimate horde size in the forest, but filming a horde crossing a gap between two forest patches or crossing a road is a reliable way of estimating the total number. The largest horde verifiably observed in this way contained over 1,300 individuals, in Lop√© National Park, Gabon‚Äîthe largest aggregation of nonhuman primates ever recorded. In the wild, males disperse and only female mandrills remain in their birth group. This benefits females to establish strong relationships with their relatives which can provide support during conflicts, better offspring and longer lifespan.Jouventin P (1975) Observations sur la socio-√©cologie du Mandrill. Terre Vie 29 439‚Äì532.Abernethy KA, White LJT, Wickings EJ (2002) Hordes of mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx): extreme group size and seasonal male presence. J Zool, Lond 258: 131‚Äì137. These hordes are made of adult females and their dependent offspring. Males live a solitary lifestyle, and enter hordes only when females are receptive to mating, which lasts three months each year. All-male bachelor groups are not known to exist. The mating season of the mandrill takes place from June to October, which is when the sexual swellings of the female occur. They breed every two years. When breeding, a male will follow and guard a female in estrus. Adult males exist in two different forms: the brightly colored and \\"fatted\\" dominant males, and the paler and \\"nonfatted\\" subordinate males. Both males engage in mating, but only the dominant males can sire offspring. Males sometimes fight for breeding rights which results in dominance. Though conflicts are rare, they can be deadly. Gaining dominance, that is becoming the alpha male, results in an \\"increased testicular volume, reddening of sexual skin on the face and genitalia, and heightened secretion of the sternal cutaneous gland\\". When a male loses dominance or its alpha status, the reverse happens, although the blue ridges remain brightened. There is also a fall in its reproductive success. This effect is gradual and takes place over a few years. When subordinates mate-guard a female, the competition between them allows the dominant males to have a greater chance of siring offspring, since subordinates outnumber dominants 21 to 1. There is also a dominance hierarchy among females, with reproductive success being displayed in shorter interbirth intervals amongst these alpha figures and the beginning of reproduction at earlier ages. Sleeping mother with young in Hagenbecks Tierpark, Hamburg, Germany A mother playing with her baby at Southwick's Zoo in Mendon, Massachusetts Mandrill births occur from January to May. Most births in Gabon occur in the wet season, from January to March, and gestation usually lasts 175 days. In captivity, 405 days separate each birth. Young are born with a black natal coat and pink skin. The females do most of the raising of the young. Alloparenting exists in this species, with female relatives providing care for the young. Males leave their natal groups when they are six years old and stay along the boundary of the social group. A family of mandrill in Artis Royal Zoo, Amsterdam, Netherlands Mandrills will make a \\"silent, bared-teeth face\\", in which the teeth are bared, the head crest is erect and the head shakes. This may serve as a peaceful form of communication. A mandrill submits by presenting its rump. With aggression, mandrills will stare, bob their heads, and slap the ground. Vocalizations like roars, crowings, and \\"two-phase grunts\\" are made for long distances, while \\"yaks\\", grunts, \\"k-alarms\\", \\"k-sounds\\", screams, girneys, and grinds are made at short distances. Status and conservation The mandrill is considered vulnerable and is affected by deforestation. However, hunting for bushmeat is the more direct threat. Mandrills are particularly threatened in the Republic of the Congo. Nevertheless, there have been captive-bred individuals that have been successfully reintroduced into the wild.

Later he chose his company, schools, and places to be according to his abiding interests, and went on to write mainly in different forms of poetry and prose, and to teach (subjects like language, literature, culture, interdisciplinary studies, and theory). Perhaps better known as an English poet, he has been a professor of English and comparative literature, an editor of literary and scholarly journals, a scholar-critic, a broadcaster, a translator, long lapsed lay minstrel, and a weekend canoeist.

He represented Carmarthenshire in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Carmarthenshire. In 1827 he was created Viscount Emlyn, of Emlyn in the County of Carmarthen, and Earl Cawdor, of Castlemartin in the County of Pembroke. These titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His son, the second Earl, was Member of Parliament for Pembrokeshire and Lord Lieutenant of Carmarthenshire. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Earl. He was a Conservative politician and served briefly as First Lord of the Admiralty in 1905.

Earl of Durham is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1833 for the prominent Whig politician and colonial official John Lambton, 1st Baron Durham. Known as \\"Radical Jack\\", he played a leading role in the passing of the Great Reform Act of 1832. As Governor General of British North America he was the author of the famous Report on the Affairs of British North America, known in Canada as the Durham Report. Lambton had already been created Baron Durham, of the City of Durham and of Lambton Castle in the County Palatine of Durham, in 1828, and was created Viscount Lambton at the same time as he was raised to the earldom. These titles are also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his eldest surviving son, the second Earl. He served as Lord-Lieutenant of County Durham from 1854 to 1879. On his death the titles passed to his eldest twin son, the third Earl. He was Lord-Lieutenant of County Durham from 1884 to 1928 and was made a Knight of the Garter in 1909. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger twin brother, the fourth Earl. He represented South Durham and South East Durham in the House of Commons. His grandson, the sixth Earl, was a Conservative politician. He disclaimed his peerages shortly after succeeding his father in 1970, but continued improperly to style himself Viscount Lambton. As of 2014 the titles are held by his only son, the seventh Earl, who succeeded in 2006. Before succeeding in the earldom he styled himself Lord Durham to avoid confusion with his father. Several other members of the Lambton family have also gained distinction. Both the first Earl's father, William Henry Lambton (1764‚Äì1797), and grandfather, Major-General John Lambton (1710‚Äì1794), as well as his great-uncle Henry Lambton (1697‚Äì1761), represented the City of Durham in Parliament. The Hon. Sir Hedworth Lambton (1856‚Äì1929) (who assumed the surname of Meux in lieu of Lambton), third son of the second Earl, was an Admiral of the Fleet. The Hon. Charles Lambton (1857‚Äì1949), fourth son of the second Earl, was a Brigadier-General in the Army. The Hon. George Lambton (1860‚Äì1945), fifth son of the second Earl, was a thoroughbred racehorse trainer who trained two Epsom Derby winners. The Hon. Sir William Lambton (1863‚Äì1936), sixth son of the second Earl, was a Major- General in the Army. The ancestral seats of the Lambton family are Lambton Castle, near Chester-le-Street, County Durham, and Fenton, near Wooler, Northumberland. In 2015 the latter, about was put up for sale for a guide price of ¬£10,000,000.http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk, 25.8.15 Lord Durham was the inventor of Dominion Status throughout the British Empire, leading to the creation of the British Commonwealth of Nations.

A fundamental domain or fundamental region is a subset of the space which contains exactly one point from each of these orbits. It serves as a geometric realization for the abstract set of representatives of the orbits. There are many ways to choose a fundamental domain. Typically, a fundamental domain is required to be a connected subset with some restrictions on its boundary, for example, smooth or polyhedral. The images of a chosen fundamental domain under the group action then tile the space. One general construction of fundamental domains uses Voronoi cells.  Hints at a general definition  A lattice in the complex plane and its fundamental domain, with quotient a torus. Given an action of a group G on a topological space X by homeomorphisms, a fundamental domain for this action is a set D of representatives for the orbits. It is usually required to be a reasonably nice set topologically, in one of several precisely defined ways. One typical condition is that D is almost an open set, in the sense that D is the symmetric difference of an open set in G with a set of measure zero, for a certain (quasi)invariant measure on X. A fundamental domain always contains a free regular set U, an open set moved around by G into disjoint copies, and nearly as good as D in representing the orbits. Frequently D is required to be a complete set of coset representatives with some repetitions, but the repeated part has measure zero. This is a typical situation in ergodic theory. If a fundamental domain is used to calculate an integral on X/G, sets of measure zero do not matter. For example, when X is Euclidean space Rn of dimension n, and G is the lattice Zn acting on it by translations, the quotient X/G is the n-dimensional torus. A fundamental domain D here can be taken to be [0,1)n, which differs from the open set (0,1)n by a set of measure zero, or the closed unit cube [0,1]n, whose boundary consists of the points whose orbit has more than one representative in D.  Examples  Examples in the three-dimensional Euclidean space R3. *for n-fold rotation: an orbit is either a set of n points around the axis, or a single point on the axis; the fundamental domain is a sector *for reflection in a plane: an orbit is either a set of 2 points, one on each side of the plane, or a single point in the plane; the fundamental domain is a half-space bounded by that plane *for reflection in a point: an orbit is a set of 2 points, one on each side of the center, except for one orbit, consisting of the center only; the fundamental domain is a half-space bounded by any plane through the center *for 180¬∞ rotation about a line: an orbit is either a set of 2 points opposite to each other with respect to the axis, or a single point on the axis; the fundamental domain is a half-space bounded by any plane through the line *for discrete translational symmetry in one direction: the orbits are translates of a 1D lattice in the direction of the translation vector; the fundamental domain is an infinite slab *for discrete translational symmetry in two directions: the orbits are translates of a 2D lattice in the plane through the translation vectors; the fundamental domain is an infinite bar with parallelogrammatic cross section *for discrete translational symmetry in three directions: the orbits are translates of the lattice; the fundamental domain is a primitive cell which is e.g. a parallelepiped, or a Wigner-Seitz cell, also called Voronoi cell/diagram. In the case of translational symmetry combined with other symmetries, the fundamental domain is part of the primitive cell. For example, for wallpaper groups the fundamental domain is a factor 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12 smaller than the primitive cell.  Fundamental domain for the modular group  Each triangular region is a free regular set of H/Œì; the grey one (with the third point of the triangle at infinity) is the canonical fundamental domain. The diagram to the right shows part of the construction of the fundamental domain for the action of the modular group Œì on the upper half-plane H. This famous diagram appears in all classical books on modular functions. (It was probably well known to C. F. Gauss, who dealt with fundamental domains in the guise of the reduction theory of quadratic forms.) Here, each triangular region (bounded by the blue lines) is a free regular set of the action of Œì on H. The boundaries (the blue lines) are not a part of the free regular sets. To construct a fundamental domain of H/Œì, one must also consider how to assign points on the boundary, being careful not to double-count such points. Thus, the free regular set in this example is :U = \\\\left{ z \\\\in H: \\\\left z \\\\right > 1,\\\\, \\\\left \\\\,\\\\mbox{Re}(z) \\\\,\\\\right < \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right}. The fundamental domain is built by adding the boundary on the left plus half the arc on the bottom including the point in the middle: :D=U\\\\cup\\\\left{ z \\\\in H: \\\\left z \\\\right \\\\geq 1,\\\\, \\\\mbox{Re}(z)=\\\\frac{-1}{2} \\\\right} \\\\cup \\\\left{ z \\\\in H: \\\\left z \\\\right = 1,\\\\, \\\\frac{-1}{2}<\\\\mbox{Re}(z)\\\\leq 0 \\\\right}. The choice of which points of the boundary to include as a part of the fundamental domain is arbitrary, and varies from author to author. The core difficulty of defining the fundamental domain lies not so much with the definition of the set per se, but rather with how to treat integrals over the fundamental domain, when integrating functions with poles and zeros on the boundary of the domain.

They resemble anthropomorphic cacti with haniwa-like faces. One of the recurring elements of the series, it initially appeared as an enemy in Final Fantasy VI. It has since become one of the mascots of the series alongside the Moogle and Chocobo, appearing in 49 Final Fantasy games and 16 non-Final Fantasy titles, and while remaining as enemies, other Cactuars have been depicted as summons as well as friendly NPCs.  Characteristics  Cactuars are typically depicted having stiff arms and legs without hands or feet, three black dots on their faces (representing two eyes and an oblong mouth) and three yellow quills at the top of their heads. Even in modern titles, they look and move in a puppet-like manner, balancing on one leg with the others bent at 90 degree angles. They are notoriously difficult to hit, and best known for their defensive attack, 1000 Needles (also called Blow Fish), which does exactly 1000 hit points of damage to an opponent, regardless of defenses. In other games, they possess an even more powerful 10,000 Needles attack. Many Cactuar variants have appeared in various games, such as the Gigantender, a large, bulky Cactuar that looks more like a typical cactus. The Cactuar is usually depicted in a head-on dashing pose without their backside visible, however, they have been noted as having a prominent rear end when photographed from the back.  History  In their first appearance in Final Fantasy VI, Cactuars (called \\"Cactrots\\" in American translation of the game) are found in a small desert west of the town of Maranda in the World of Ruin. Most attacks (physical or otherwise) completely miss it, even though it only has 4 hit points, making it difficult to kill without the use of special items. They have since appeared in nearly every game in the series, as well as other non-series games such as Mario Hoops 3-on-3, Dragon Quest X, and Monster Hunter: World. In World of Final Fantasy, the main character can travel by train, operated by a character known as the Cactuar Conductor.  Reception  Jason Wilson of VentureBeat called the Cactuar his favorite video game monster, saying that, while \\"kinda cute\\", they \\"can be scary [...] especially when these cowardly creatures stick around instead of running away and launch its devastating 1,000 Needles attack\\", also saying that they can easily cause a total party kill. Mike Fahey of Kotaku stated that the Cactuar was \\"one of Final Fantasy's most iconic creatures\\", and commented that the Final Fantasy XIV Gigatender was \\"doing the best it can to live up to that legacy, bless its giant plant heart\\", also stating that they \\"are adorable enough that I just want to sit in The Fields of Amber and watch them nearly topple all day long\\".

History The first creation was in 1675 for Charles FitzCharles, one of the dozens of illegitimate children of King Charles II and one of a few by his mistress Catherine Pegge. He died without heirs in 1680, and the title became extinct. The second creation came in 1682 in favour of Thomas Hickman-Windsor, 7th Baron Windsor. The family descends from Sir Andrew Windsor, who fought at the Battle of the Spurs in 1513, where he was knighted. In 1529 he was summoned to Parliament as Baron Windsor, of Stanwell in the County of Buckingham. His grandson, Edward, the third Baron, fought at the Battle of St Quentin in 1557. Edward's elder son Frederick, the fourth Baron, died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother, Henry. The latter's son, Thomas, the sixth Baron, was a Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy. On Thomas's death in 1641, the barony fell into abeyance between his sisters. The abeyance was terminated in 1660 in favour of his nephew, Thomas Hickman. He was the son of the Honourable Elizabeth Windsor, and her husband Dixie Hickman, and assumed the additional surname of Windsor as 7th Baron. He notably served as Governor of Jamaica and as Lord Lieutenant of Worcestershire. In 1682, he was created Earl of Plymouth in the Peerage of England, thus elevating his nobility. He was succeeded by his grandson Other, who notably served as Lord Lieutenant of Cheshire, Denbigh and Flint. His grandson and namesake, Other, the fourth Earl, was Lord Lieutenant of Glamorganshire. On the death of fourth Earl's childless grandson, Other, the sixth Earl, in 1833, the barony and earldom separated. The barony fell into abeyance between his sisters Lady Maria Windsor, wife of Arthur Hill, 3rd Marquess of Downshire, and Lady Harriet Windsor, wife of the Honourable Robert Clive, second son of Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis (see below for further history of the barony and Earl of Powis for earlier history of the Clive family). The sixth Earl was succeeded in the earldom by his uncle, Andrew, the seventh Earl. The seventh Earl died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, Henry, the eighth Earl. The eighth Earl was childless and on his death in 1843 the earldom became extinct. The barony of Windsor remained in abeyance until 1855 when the abeyance was terminated in favour of Lady Harriet Windsor-{Clive), who became the thirteenth Baroness. The same year she re- assumed by Royal licence her maiden surname, as a first barrel of her name. Her eldest son the Hon. Robert Windsor-Clive predeceased her and she was succeeded by her grandson, Robert, the fourteenth Baron, who was a prominent Conservative politician and held office as Paymaster-General and First Commissioner of Works. In 1905 the earldom of Plymouth was revived in the third creation when Robert was created Viscount Windsor, of St Fagans in the County of Glamorgan, and Earl of Plymouth, in the County of Devon. These titles were in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The first Earl was succeeded by his second and only surviving son, Ivor, the second Earl, who was also a Conservative politician and served as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms, Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Under- Secretary of State for the Colonies and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Ivor's eldest son, Other, the third Earl, succeeded in 1943 and died on 7 March 2018 when he was succeeded by his own son, Ivor, the present fourth Earl. As a male-line descendant of the first Earl of Powis in its present creation the Earl is in far remainder to that peerage and its subsidiary titles. Windsor-Clive family plot in the cemetery of St Bartholomew's church, Tardebigge, Worcestershire. Robert, 1st Earl of Plymouth (1857‚Äì1923) and his family are buried here. Another member of the family was the Honourable Thomas Windsor, younger son of Thomas Hickman-Windsor, 1st Earl of Plymouth, who was elevated to the new title Viscount Windsor in 1699. After the death of his son, the second Viscount, the title was extinct for 38 years from 1758. However his daughter and heiress, Charlotte Jane, married John Stuart, 4th Earl of Bute and the title Viscount Windsor was revived from 1796 as a secondary subsidiary (courtesy) style under the Marquess of Bute (the first subsidiary title was Earl of Dumfries). The family seat was Hewell Grange, Worcestershire.

Development The original specification that led to the VG series was offered in 1936 in order to quickly raise the number of modern aircraft in French service, by supplying a \\"light fighter\\" of wooden construction that could be built rapidly in large numbers. The contract resulted in three designs, the VG-30, the Caudron C.714 and the Bloch MB.700. Prototypes of all three were ordered. Named for engineer Michel Vernisse (V) and designer Jean Galtier (G), the VG-30 was all wooden in construction, using plywood over stringers in a semi-monocoque construction. The layout was conventional, a low-wing monoplane that bore a striking resemblance to the later Italian Macchi C.202. Armament consisted of a 20 mm Hispano-Suiza HS.404 cannon firing through the propeller hub, and four 7.5 mm MAC 1934 M39 drum-fed machine guns, two in each wing. The design was supposed to be powered by the Potez 12Dc flat-12 air-cooled inline engine, but this ran into development problems. The prototype was then fitted with a Hispano-Suiza 12Xcrs instead, and flew in this form in October 1938. In order to find some solution to the engine problem, the VG-31 was to use the 632 kW (860 hp) Hispano-Suiza 12Y-31 and the VG-32 the Allison V-1710C-15. The VG-31 flew in 1939 and proved to have excellent performance. The prototype VG-32 was completed in 1940 and awaiting its test flight when it was captured by the advancing German forces at Villacoublay. The VG-33 was a modified version of the VG-31 using the same 12Y-31, and first flew on April 25, 1939. It had a surprisingly good performance of 560 km/h (348mph), and was ordered into production with a contract for 220 aircraft in September, later raised to 1,000. Production did not take long to start, but most of the airframes never received engines and sat at the factory when it fell to the Germans. Further developments continued while the VG-33 production started. The VG-34 mounted the newer 688 kW (935 hp) 12Y-45, the VG-36 used the 735 kW (1,000 hp) 12Y-51 originally intended for the VG-35, and introduced a new streamlined radiator bath that looked similar to the one on the P-51 Mustang. Single prototypes of all three were built and flown in early 1940. The VG-37 was an extended-range version of the -36, while the VG-38 was to have used the 12Y-77, but neither was built. The last in the series was the VG-39, originally powered by the new 882 kW (1,200 hp) 12Y-89 using an extension shaft on the propeller to streamline the nose profile, giving the plane an excellent speed of 625 km/h (388 mph) even when loaded down with two more machine guns. The actual production version was to have been the VG-39bis, powered by the new 1177 kW (1,600 hp) Hispano-Suiza 12Z-17, using the streamlined radiator intake design from the VG-36. Two more designs were projected, both based on the VG-39bis airframe. The VG-40 mounted the Rolls-Royce Merlin III and the VG-50 the newer Allison V-1710-39. Neither was built. Operational history The continual production problems that plagued the VG-33 meant that it never took part in combat. Only 19 aircraft, out of about 40 completed (and about 160 close to completion), had been received by the Arm√©e de l'Air by the time of Armistice. Only two machines ever flew in an active unit ‚Äì GC 1/55 which commenced operations under chaotic conditions, four days before the capitulation. Although the VG-33 was lighter than the Dewoitine D.520 and used the same engine, the VG-33 was not significantly faster than the D.520. While it was under-armed in comparison to the Messerschmitt Bf 109, the VG-33 could have matched it in speed and maneuverability below 5,000 metres. As was also the case with the D.520, the limitations of the supercharger used meant that the VG-33 could not match the speed of the Bf 109 above 5,000 m. German authorities confiscated 12 VG-33s, which may have been used by the Luftwaffe for training purposes (e.g. in a dissimilar/aggressor role).

Its United Kingdom version was created in 1837 for Kenneth Howard, 11th Baron Howard of Effingham, named after the village of Effingham where they held the manor. This ennobled branch of the House of Howard stems from the noted naval commander and politician Lord William Howard, senior son of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk from his second marriage to Agnes Tylney. William served as Lord High Admiral, as Lord Chamberlain of the Household and as Lord Privy Seal. In 1554 he was created Baron Howard of Effingham in the Peerage of England as a reward for leading the defence of London against Wyatt's rebellion. His successor son was better known to history as Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, after being granted that title in 1596. He was Lord High Admiral from 1585 to 1618 and served as commander-in-chief of the English fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588. In 1603 his eldest son and heir apparent William Howard, Lord Howard of Effingham (1577‚Äì1615), was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father's junior title of Baron Howard of Effingham. He predeceased his father relatively young so is not considered to have succeeded as third Baron Howard of Effingham. The Earl's titles thus passed to a younger son, the second Earl. He represented Bletchingley, Surrey and Sussex in the House of Commons and served as Lord- Lieutenant of Surrey. He was childless and was succeeded by his half-brother, the third Earl. On his death in 1681 the earldom became extinct. The barony descended to the most senior male first cousin (twice removed downwards), who became the fifth Lord Howard. He was the great-grandson of Sir William Howard (d. 1600), younger son of the first Baron: this Lord Howard of Effingham served as Governor of Virginia from 1683 to 1692. His eldest son, the sixth Baron, died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the seventh Baron. He was a prominent military commander. In 1731 he was made Earl of Effingham in the Peerage of Great Britain. His grandson, the third Earl, served under William Pitt the Younger as Master of the Mint from 1784 to 1789 and was Governor of Jamaica from 1789 to 1791. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. On his death in 1816 the earldom became extinct. The barony descended to a third cousin, the eleventh Baron. He was the grandson of Lieutenant-General Thomas Howard, son of George Howard, younger brother of the fifth Baron. Lord Howard of Effingham was a General in the Army. In 1837 the earldom of Effingham was revived when he was made Earl of Effingham, in the County of Surrey, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He represented Shaftesbury in Parliament as a Whig from 1841 to 1845. The titles descended from father to son until the death of his grandson, the fourth Earl, in 1927. He never married and was succeeded by his first cousin, the fifth Earl. He was the son of Captain the Hon. Frederick Charles Howard (1840‚Äì1893), second son of the second Earl. His eldest son, the sixth Earl, died childless in 1996. He was succeeded by his nephew David, the seventh Earl and (as of 2009) present holder of the titles. He is the son of the Hon. John Algernon Frederick Charles Howard (1901‚Äì1971), second son of the fifth Earl. Another member of this branch of the Howard family was Field Marshal Sir George Howard active in the mid-18th century. He was the son of the aforementioned Lieutenant-General Thomas Howard and the brother of Henry Howard, father of Kenneth Alexander Howard, 1st Earl of Effingham. The family seat is Readings Farmhouse, near Blackmore End, Essex.

He earned a reputation for great gallantry. Appointed to the royal yacht, he was close to the British royal family. Prior to the First World War, his combat service during the Mahdist War and the Boxer Rebellion was all ashore. Appointed Commander-in- Chief of the North America and West Indies Station before the war, his mission was to protect Allied merchant shipping by hunting down German commerce raiders. Late in 1914 he was tasked to search for and destroy the East Asia Squadron of the Imperial German Navy as it headed home around the tip of South America. Believing that he had no choice but to engage the squadron in accordance with his orders, despite his numerical and tactical inferiority, he was killed during the Battle of Coronel off the coast of Chile in November when the German ships sank his flagship.  Early life and career  Cradock was born at Hartforth, Richmond, North Yorkshire on 2 July 1862, the fourth son of Christopher and Georgina Cradock (n√©e Duff). He joined the Royal Navy's cadet training ship on 15 January 1875 and was appointed to the armoured corvette of the Mediterranean Station on 22 December 1876. Cradock was promoted to midshipman on 22 December 1877 and was present when the British occupied the island of Cyprus the following year. He was transferred to the ironclad on 25 July 1879 and then to the corvette on the China Station on 24 August 1880. Promoted to acting sub-lieutenant on 21 December 1881, Cradock returned to England on 6 March 1882 to prepare for his lieutenant's exams which he passed a year later. His rank confirmed, he then passed gunnery and torpedo courses later in 1883.Dunn, pp. 9‚Äì14 Cradock was assigned to the ironclad in the Mediterranean after completing his courses and in 1884 was assigned to the naval brigade which had been formed for service during the Mahdist War. After serving in a support role during the war, he returned to his shipDunn, pp. 16‚Äì17, 214 where he was promoted to lieutenant on 30 June 1885. Cradock was then appointed to the gunboat as her first lieutenant and remained there until he was placed on half-pay on 9 May 1889. He was briefly recalled to active duty aboard the new battleship to help during her shakedown cruise and to prepare her for the fleet review in Spithead in August. Cradock then spent a year on the corvette , assigned to the Training Squadron. During this time, he published his first book, Sporting Notes from the East, about the shooting of game.Dunn, pp. 17‚Äì18 On 6 September 1890, Cradock was appointed first lieutenant of the sloop-of-war which arrived in the Red Sea shortly afterwards. The Mahdist War had flared up again and the British formed the Eastern Sudan Field Force around the garrison at Suakin, on Sudan's Red Sea coast. Cradock was assigned to the force in 1891 and participated in the capture of Tokar. He then became aide-de-camp to Colonel Charles Holled Smith, Governor-General of the Red Sea Littoral and Commandant, Suakin. For his service in this campaign, he was awarded the Ottoman Empire's Order of the Medjidie, 4th Class and the Khedive's Star with the Tokar Clasp. After returning to Dolphin, Cradock helped to rescue the crew of the , which had wrecked on the coast of the Red Sea near Ras Zeith on 21 January 1893 during an around-the-world cadet cruise.Dunn, pp. 18‚Äì19 After a brief time on half- pay and another gunnery course, Cradock was appointed to the royal yacht Victoria and Albert on 31 August 1894 and published his second book, Wrinkles in Seamanship, or, Help to a Salt Horse. He served as a pallbearer at the funeral of Prince Henry of Battenberg on 5 February 1896. Promoted to commander on 31 August, he became the second-in-command of HMS Britannia. Before the beginning of the Second Boer War in October 1899, Cradock was briefly transferred to the drill ship to serve as a transport officer, supervising the loading of troops and supplies for South Africa, and was reduced to half-pay before the end of the year.Dunn, pp. 19, 23, 25‚Äì27 Command and flag rank On 1 February 1900 he was appointed in command of the third-class cruiser HMS Alacrity, which was posted to later that year to the China Station during the Boxer Rebellion. He commanded a mixture of British, German and Japanese sailors during the capture of the Taku forts on 17 June, led a contingent of British and Italian sailors into the Tientsin on 23 June, and then led the naval brigade that relieved Vice-Admiral Edward Seymour's troops besieged in the Pei-yang Arsenal three days later. Cradock was promoted to captain effective 18 April 1901 and also received the Prussian Order of the Crown, 2nd Class with swords as a result of his actions. Alacrity arrived back in Britain on 32 July 1901 and Cradock was placed on half- pay.Dunn, pp. 30‚Äì33 On 24 March 1902 he was posted to the protected cruiser on the Mediterranean Station, where from June that year he served as flag captain to Rear-Admiral Sir Baldwin Wake Walker who commanded the fleet's cruiser squadron. Cradock was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 26 June. He assumed command of the armoured cruiser on 19 December and Wake Walker shifted his flag to the ship the following day.Dunn, p. 53 When King Edward VII visited Malta on 2 June 1903, he appointed Cradock a Member of the Royal Victorian Order. Off the coast of Sardinia, Cradock saved Prince Vudhijaya Chalermlabha, then serving as a midshipman in the Royal Navy, from drowning in April 1904. After the Dogger Bank Incident, Wake Walker commanded the cruisers, including Bacchante, shadowing the Russian Baltic Fleet as it steamed through the Mediterranean in October en route to the Far East. On 17 January 1905, Cradock assumed command of the armoured cruiser , but was invalided home on 17 June. He was on sick leave until September and was then placed on half-pay.Dunn, pp. 56‚Äì57 Cradock became captain of the battleship on 17 July 1906 and was relieved on 6 August 1908, publishing his last book, Whispers from the Fleet, in 1907. During this time the Royal Navy was riven by the feud between the reforming First Sea Lord, Admiral Jackie Fisher and the traditionalist Admiral Charles Beresford and their followers.Dunn, pp. 68, 76‚Äì78 While Cradock's position on the issues dividing the navy are not positively known, a passage from Whispers from the Fleet may offer a clue: \\"... we require ‚Äì and quickly too ‚Äì some strong Imperial body of men who will straightway choke the irrepressible utterings of a certain class of individuals who, to their shame, are endeavouring to break down the complete loyalty and good comradeship that now exists in the service between the officers and the men; and who are also willing to commit the heinous crime of trifling with the sacred laws of naval discipline\\".Quoted in Dunn, pp. 78‚Äì79 After leaving command, he was again put on half-pay. He was appointed Naval Aide-de-Camp to Edward VII in February 1909 although he remained on half-pay. On 1 July Cradock was appointed in command of the Royal Naval Barracks, Portsmouth and promoted to Commodore second class while retaining his duties as aide-de-camp. Edward VII died on 6 May 1910 and Cradock stayed on until the end of October to assist his newly crowned son, King George V.Dunn, pp. 67‚Äì69, 76‚Äì79 In the meantime he had been promoted to rear-admiral on 24 August 1910, and was relieved of his command in October. Still on half-pay Cradock reported to the Royal Hospital Haslar on 24 February 1911 with kidney troubles and discharged himself on 7 March to attend a staff course at the Royal Naval War College at Portsmouth that lasted until 23 June. He came in sixth out of seven students, and was noted as \\"very attentive, but sick 1/3 of the term\\". On the 24th Cradock escorted visitors aboard a merchant ship to the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead. He became second-in-command of the Atlantic Fleet on 29 August, hoisting his flag aboard the predreadnought battleship . When the ocean liner ran aground during the night of 12/13 December near Cape Spartel, Morocco, smashing all of her lifeboats, Cradock was ordered to take London and the armoured cruiser to rescue the survivors in heavy seas. It took five days to get all of the passengers and crewmen off the ship, including Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife, his wife, the Princess Royal, and the king's granddaughters. In recognition of his efforts, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on 28 February 1912Dunn, pp. 88‚Äì92 and later awarded the Sea Gallantry Medal. flying-off ramp at bottom left. In May Cradock shifted his flag to the predreadnought battleship where he took charge of experiments that the RN was conducting with launching aircraft from ships. Commander Charles Samson had already flown off from Hibernias sister ship while anchored earlier and she transferred her flying-off equipment to Hibernia, including a runway constructed over her forecastle above her forward 12-inch turret that stretched from her bridge to her bows. Samson took off from Hibernia in his Short Improved S.27 biplane while the ship steamed at in front of George V at the Royal Fleet Review in Weymouth Bay on 9 May, the first person to take off from a moving ship. Cradock hauled down his flag on 29 August and went on half-pay.Dunn, pp. 92, 94 On 8 February 1913, he was given command of the 4th Cruiser Squadron, formerly the North America and West Indies Station and hoisted his flag in the armoured cruisers then . His orders from the Admiralty were to protect British lives and property during the ongoing Mexican Revolution, but to avoid any action that could be construed as British interference in internal Mexican affairs. The British Minister to Mexico, Sir Lionel Carden strongly disagreed with the official policy and argued for some sort of intervention. The situation was further confused by American suspicion of British actions, believing that the Monroe Doctrine meant that the Americans alone could intervene in Mexico.Dunn, pp. 96‚Äì98 Together with the American Rear Admiral Frank Friday Fletcher, Cradock coordinated the evacuation of British and American citizens from Tampico, Mexico, when that city was threatened by rebels.Dunn, p. 97 He then transferred his flag to on 18 February 1914 and sailed to Galveston, Texas, where he arrived at the end of the month.Transcript There he visited some of the refugees and was feted by the Americans, including a visit with the Governor of Texas, Oscar Colquitt before returning to Mexican waters. Cradock was in Tampico, when the Mexican Army briefly arrested nine American sailors who were purchasing petrol in the city on 9 April. Rear Admiral Henry T. Mayo, commander of the American forces off-shore, demanded an apology, but the Mexican government refused. The incident contributed to the American decision to occupy Veracruz on 21 April. Cradock was able to evacuate some 1,500 refugees from Tampico, Mexico City and Veracruz without incident.Dunn, pp. 99‚Äì101 First World War Having flown his flag in HMS Suffolk, Cradock transferred to the armoured cruiser HMS Good Hope (pictured) in late August 1914 When the preliminary warning for war with Imperial Germany reached Cradock on 27 July, there were two German light cruisers in his area as the brand-new was in the process of . Cradock dispersed his cruisers to search and track the German ships, but the Admiralty was concerned about the presence of numerous ocean liners in New York that it deemed capable of being converted into armed merchant cruisers and ordered him to concentrate three of his cruisers off New York harbour. He was able to order a pair of his ships northwards and followed them in Suffolk before the declaration of war on 4 August.Corbett, pp. 45‚Äì47 On the morning of 6 August, Suffolk spotted Karlsruhe in the process of transferring guns and equipment to the liner about north of Watling Island. The two ships quickly departed in different directions; Suffolk followed Karlsruhe and Craddock ordered the light cruiser to intercept her. Karlsruhes faster speed allowed her to quickly outpace Suffolk, but Bristol caught her that evening and fruitlessly fired at her before the German ship disengaged in the darkness. Craddock had anticipated her manoeuvres and continued eastwards, but Karlsruhe was almost out of coal and had slowed down to her most economical speed and passed behind Suffolk the following morning without being spotted before putting into Puerto Rico with only of coal remaining.Corbett, pp. 47‚Äì50 Cradock continued northward in obedience to his orders and, after rendezvousing with the newly arrived armoured cruiser in Halifax, Canada, transferred his flag to her because she was faster than Suffolk. Dresden was under orders to rendezvous with the East Asia Squadron in the Pacific and Karlsruhe to intercept Allied merchantmen off the north-eastern coast of Brazil, so the reported losses of shipping showed both ships moving south. In response, the Admiralty ordered Cradock southward on 22 August and appointed him in command of the South American Station the following month whilst reinforcing him with the elderly and slow predreadnought battleship .Corbett, pp. 51, 258‚Äì264 On 14 September, Cradock received new orders from the Admiralty: he was apprised that the East Asia Squadron was probably heading for either the west coast of South America or the Strait of Magellan and that he was to detach sufficient force to deal with Dresden and Karlsruhe while concentrating his remaining ships to meet the Germans, using the Falkland Islands to re-coal. To achieve this aim, he was to be reinforced by the modern armoured cruiser arriving from the Mediterranean. Until she arrived Cradock was to keep Canopus and one with his flagship, Good Hope. Once he had superior force, he was to search for and destroy the German cruisers and break up German trade on the west coast whilst being prepared to fall back and cover the River Plate area.Corbett, p. 309 The day that the Admiralty issued its order, the East Asia Squadron appeared at occupied German Samoa. Its apparent movement to the west, and the continuing depredations of the light cruiser in the Bay of Bengal, caused the Admiralty to conclude that Vice-Admiral Graf Maximilian von Spee, commander of the East Asia Squadron, meant to rendezvous with Emden in the south western Pacific and cancelled the transfer of Defence to Cradock's command.Corbett, pp. 290‚Äì291 Two days later the Admiralty messaged Cradock that von Spee was moving away from South America and that he should search the south western coast of South America for German ships without worrying about keeping his ships concentrated, but failed to inform him that Defence would not now be sent to him.Corbett, pp. 309‚Äì310 By late September, it had become clear that Dresden had passed into the Pacific Ocean and Cradock's ships fruitlessly searched several different anchorages in the area of Tierra del Fuego before having to return to Port Stanley in the Falklands to re-coal on 3 October. Based on intercepted radio signals, the Admiralty advised him two days later that the East Asia Squadron was probably headed his way, although he did not receive the message until 7 October.Corbett, pp. 310‚Äì315 The Hunt for the East Asia Squadron By late October Cradock had reliable intelligence that the East Asia Squadron had reached the western coast of South America. Cradock's fleet was significantly weaker than Spee's, mainly consisting of elderly vessels manned by largely inexperienced crews. However, the orders he received from the Admiralty were ambiguous; although they were meant to make him concentrate his ships on the old battleship Canopus, Cradock interpreted them as instructing him to seek and engage the enemy forces. Clarifying instructions from the Admiralty were not issued until 3 November, by which time the battle had already been fought.Halpern, pp. 91‚Äì92 =Battle of Coronel= Monument to Sir Christopher Cradock in York Minster Cradock found Spee's force off Chile in the late afternoon of 1 November, and decided to engage, starting the Battle of Coronel. Useless for anything other than searching, he sent the armed merchant cruiser Otranto away. He tried to close the range immediately to engage with his shorter-ranged six-inch guns and so that the enemy would have the setting sun in their eyes, but von Spee kept the range open until dusk, when the British cruisers were silhouetted in the afterglow, while his ships were hidden by darkness. Heavily disadvantaged because the high seas had rendered the main-deck six-inch guns on Good Hope and unusable, and with partially trained crews, Cradock's two armoured cruisers were destroyed with the loss of all 1,660 lives, including his own; the light cruiser managed to escape. This battle was the first defeat of the Royal Navy in a naval action in more than a hundred years.Dunn, p. 152; Halpern, p. 93 Departing from Port Stanley he had left behind a letter to be forwarded to Admiral Hedworth Meux in the event of his death. In this he commented that he did not intend to suffer the fate of Rear-Admiral Ernest Troubridge, who had been court- martialled in August for failing to engage the enemy despite the odds being severely against him, during the pursuit of the German warships Goeben and Breslau. The Governor of the Falklands and the Governor's aide both reported that Cradock had not expected to survive.Massie, pp. 219‚Äì221 A monument to Cradock, sculpted by F. W. Pomeroy, was placed in York Minster on 16 June 1916.Dunn, pp. 180‚Äì181 It is on the east side of the North Transept towards the Chapter House entrance. There is another monument to Cradock in Catherington churchyard, Hampshire. There is a monument and a stained glass window in Cradock's memory in his parish church at Gilling West. Having no known grave, he is commemorated by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission on Portsmouth Naval Memorial.  Personal life  Cradock never married, but kept a dog which accompanied him at sea. He commented that he would choose to die either during an accident while hunting (his favourite pastime), or during action at sea.Massie, pp. 218‚Äì219 ReferencesBibliography  * * Further reading  * * Category:1862 births Category:1914 deaths Category:Captains who went down with the ship Category:Royal Navy admirals of World War I Category:Knights Commander of the Royal Victorian Order Category:Companions of the Order of the Bath Category:British military personnel killed in World War I Category:Royal Navy personnel of the Boxer Rebellion Category:People from Richmond, North Yorkshire Category:19th-century British writers Category:20th-century British writers Category:Recipients of the Sea Gallantry Medal ","title":"Christopher Cradock"},{"id":"469391","text":"This is an alphabetical index of articles related to curves used in mathematics. * Acnode * Algebraic curve * Arc * Asymptote * Asymptotic curve * Barbier's theorem * B√©zier curve * B√©zout's theorem * Birch and Swinnerton- Dyer conjecture * Bitangent * Bitangents of a quartic * Cartesian coordinate system * Caustic * Ces√†ro equation * Chord (geometry) * Cissoid * Circumference * Closed timelike curve * concavity * Conchoid (mathematics) * Confocal * Contact (mathematics) * Contour line * Crunode * Cubic Hermite curve * Curvature * Curve orientation * Curve fitting ** Curve-fitting compaction * Curve of constant width * Curve of pursuit * Curves in differential geometry * Cusp * Cyclogon * De Boor algorithm * Differential geometry of curves * Eccentricity (mathematics) * Elliptic curve cryptography * Envelope (mathematics) * Fenchel's theorem * Genus (mathematics) * Geodesic * Geometric genus * Great-circle distance * Harmonograph * Hedgehog (curve) * Hilbert's sixteenth problem * Hyperelliptic curve cryptography * Inflection point * Inscribed square problem * intercept, y-intercept, x-intercept * Intersection number * Intrinsic equation * Isoperimetric inequality * Jordan curve ** Jordan curve theorem * Knot * Limit cycle * Linking coefficient * List of circle topics * Loop (knot) * M-curve * Mannheim curve * Meander (mathematics) * Mordell conjecture * Natural representation * Opisometer * Orbital elements * Osculating circle * Osculating plane * Osgood curve * Parallel (curve) * Parallel transport * Parametric curve ** B√©zier curve ** Spline (mathematics) *** Hermite spline **** Beta spline ***** B-spline *** Higher-order spline *** NURBS * Perimeter * Pi * Plane curve * Pochhammer contour * Polar coordinate system * Prime geodesic * Projective line * Ray * Regular parametric representation * Reuleaux triangle * Ribaucour curve * Riemann‚ÄìHurwitz formula * Riemann‚ÄìRoch theorem * Riemann surface * Road curve * Sato‚ÄìTate conjecture * secant * Singular solution * Sinuosity * Slope * Space curve * Spinode * Square wheel * Subtangent * Tacnode * Tangent * Tangent space * Tangential angle * Torsion of curves * Trajectory * Transcendental curve * W-curve * Whewell equation * World line See also * Curve * List of curves * List of differential geometry topics Curve ","title":"List of curves topics"},{"id":"469395","text":"was a village located in Kanzaki District, Saga Prefecture, Japan.

Also called the central fissure, or the fissure of Rolando or the Rolandic fissure, after Luigi Rolando. It is sometimes confused with the medial longitudinal fissure. The central sulcus is a prominent landmark of the brain, separating the parietal lobe from the frontal lobe and the primary motor cortex from the primary somatosensory cortex.  Evolution of the Central Sulcus  The evolution of the central sulcus is theorized to have occurred in mammals when the complete dissociation of the original somatosensory cortex from its mirror duplicate developed in placental mammals such as primates, though the development did not stop there as time progressed the distinction between the two cortices grew.  Evolution in Primates  The central sulcus is more prominent in apes as a result of fine-tuning of the motor system in apes. Hominins (bipedal apes) continued this trend through increased use of their hands due to the advent of bipedalism. This allowed for their hands to be freed up from their use in locomotion to focus on more complex manipulative actions such as grasping, tool use, tool making, and many others. Previous studies have also shown that the location where the split in the central sulcus occurs is at the division point between the wrist and the individual digits in primary motor cortex, further implicating the relation between the development of this region through the use of their digits. The KNOB is also a suggested cortical substrate of the hand, as there have been anatomical asymmetries which have been linked to hand preference and skill, further suggesting the development of hands in the formation of the central sulcus seeing as the KNOB is the central portion of the central sulcus folded over the buried gyrus.  Development in Humans  The central sulcus begins developing around 13 weeks of gestational age undergoes the fastest period of growth between 13 and 15 weeks of gestational age. However, the most active period of development is at approximately 18 to 19 weeks of gestational age. This is determined by when there is the greatest amount of migration of neurons and fibers occurring. It begins as a point or groove in the parasagittal region of the brain. It then becomes a distinct invagination that lengthens towards the lateral sulcus and towards the longitudinal fissure at approximately 22 to 23 weeks of gestational age. Between 2 and 3 years of age, the landmark ‚ÄòPli de Passage Frontoparietal Moyen‚Äô (PPFM), which is a depression buried at the central part of the central sulcus, begins to appear. At 3 years of age, the average depth curve of the central sulcus is similar to that of adults.  Influences on Development  The development of the shape of the central sulcus is influenced by both genetic and non-genetic factors. The deep structure of the central sulcus has been found to be more consistent in different brains than its superficial structure, suggesting that the superficial structure is more susceptible to non-genetic factors. The shape of the central sulcus has been found to be different between people of different biological sex. Those of male biological sex have been found to have a less convoluted (small fractal dimension) right anterior wall of the central sulcus. In addition, while the width of the central sulcus varies, the central sulcus of males has shown to have a larger average width than the central sulcus of females. However, this is specific to the right hemisphere since the central sulcus of the left hemisphere has not shown significant results regarding gender differences. With regard to gender differences between hemispheres, females have been shown to have a larger average width of the central sulcus on the left side compared to that of the central sulcus on the right side. Age also affects the shape of the central sulcus. In adults, the distance between the anterior and posterior walls (sulcal span) increases, while the surface area of walls, the sulcal length of the posterior wall, and the convolution (fractal dimension) for the right posterior wall of the central sulcus decrease. The posterior walls of the central sulcus appear to be affected more with age. Differences between genders regarding the average width of the central sulcus as one ages has also been shown. The average width of the central sulcus in males tends to increase more rapidly over time than that of females. The surface area of the central sulcus has proven to have an effect on the handedness of an individual. Studies have found that when the central sulcus is larger in the left hemisphere, the individual tends to me more right hand dominant. This is also true about the central sulcus for left handed individuals; there is a greater surface area of the central sulcus in the right hemisphere. While the surface area of the central sulcus is shown to affect the handedness of an individual, it is not understood what the shape of the central sulcus affects as it is not widely explored. There is a region of the central sulcus, called the ‚Äúhand knob‚Äù, which is a notch in the area of the hand motor region. The position of this ‚Äúknob‚Äù can be indicative as well of someone's handedness.Sun ZY, Kl√∂ppel S, Rivi√®re D, Perrot M, Frackowiak R, Siebner H, Mangin J-F. The effect of handedness on the shape of the central sulcus. NeuroImage. 2012;60(1):332‚Äì339. doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.12.050 As motor functions develop, it is expected that the shape of the central sulcus will change. This is due to the role of the central sulcus in separating the primary motor cortex and primary somatosensory cortex. For example, differences along the central sulcus have been reported in musicians, particularly with regard to an omega formation along the center portion of the central sulcus, commonly referred to as the \\"hand knob\\". Among musicians who specialize in string instruments, this omega formation is specific to the right central sulcus. However, among pianists, this omega formation occurs on both sides but more prominently on the left side.  Diseases and Disorders = Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)  Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been associated with sensorimotor deficits and the central sulcus divides both somatosensory and primary motor areas prompting research into how the shape of the central sulcus and ADHD may alter brain development in these individuals.Li, S., Wang, S., Li, X., Li, Q., & Li, X. (2015). Abnormal surface morphology of the central sulcus in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Frontiers in neuroanatomy, 9, 114. https://doi.org/10.3389/fnana.2015.00114 The cortical thickness and average and maximum depth of the central sulcus has been shown to be larger for ADHD individuals when compared to neurotypical individuals. Additionally, changes in the middle sections of the central sulcus have been linked to children with ADHD.  Williams Syndrome  The morphology of the central sulcus has been suggested to play a role in individuals with the generic condition known as Williams syndrome.Jackowski, A.P., & Schultz, R.T. (2005). Foreshortened Dorsal Extension of the Central Sulcus in Williams Syndrome. Cortex, 41, 3. https://doi.org/10.1016/S0010-9452(08)70266-1 The foreshortening of the central sulcus has been found to be an abnormality associated with this syndrome. This can be seen with the abnormal dorsal end of the central sulcus in individuals with Williams syndrome. However, the abnormal dorsal end of the central sulcus has not been found to be linked to impaired general intelligence. The functional importance of this abnormal part of the central sulcus is still not fully understood though.  Severe Cerebral Small Vessel Disease  The shape of the central sulcus has been linked to the degree of disability in individuals who have a small subcortical ischemic stroke as a result of severe cerebral small vessel disease.Jouvent, E, Sun, ZY, De Guio, F, Duchesnay, E, Duering, M, Ropele, S, Dichgans, M, Mangin, JF, & Chabriat, H. (2016). Shape of the Central Sulcus and Disability After Subcortical Stroke: A Motor Reserve Hypothesis. Stroke, 47, https://doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.115.012562 However, the severity of the disability has been found to not be fully dependent upon the morphology of the central sulcus. It was found to possibly be due to the hand knobs‚Äô vertical position and size. It was found to possibly be due to the hand knobs‚Äô vertical position and size.

She was a US built ship provided under lend lease and returned to the US at the end of hostilities. History HMS Atheling SLV, 18 December 1945 She was built by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation (later Todd Pacific of Tacoma, Washington) under Maritime Commission Contract. She was launched 7 September 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Richard P. Luker, and commissioned on 12 July 1943 as USS Glacier AVG-33 under the command of Comdr. Ward C. Gilbert. Her designation was changed to CVE-33 on 15 July 1943. She was transferred on 31 July 1943 at Vancouver, British Columbia to the Royal Navy. Following formal transfer the ship was sent to the Royal Canadian Navy dockyard at Esquimalt for conversion for British use. Following the work she was commissioned as Atheling on 28 October. She sailed via Panama and New York arriving in the UK in January 1944 and underwent further modification to operate fighter aircraft. Atheling transferred to the Far East for operations there, one airgroup comprising 10 Wildcats plus 10 Seafires. Atheling ferried the following RN squadrons to the Far East, April 1944: 1837: 14 Corsair II disembarked Ceylon April 13 1838: 10 Corsair II disembarked Ceylon April 13 822: 12 Barra II disembarked Madras April 11 823: 12 Barra II disembarked Madras April 12 From November 1944 into 1945, she was engaged on aircraft ferry duties for British and US fleets. After the war she was used as troopship before return to the US. From October 1945 to April 1946, her commanding officer was Capt. John Inglis, who was to become director of Naval Intelligence in July 1954. Atheling put into Norfolk, Virginia, 6 December 1946 for return to the United States. Her name was stricken from the Naval Register 7 February 1947 and she was sold to National Bulk Carriers as the merchant ship Roma 26 November 1947. She was scrapped in Italy in November 1967.

It is not to be confused with the almost contemporary Liber mirabilis.

As the above indicates, the book‚Äîwhose only known complete translation (by Edouard Bricon) was published in French in 1831‚Äîhad two parts, the first in Latin and the second, shorter, in French. It contained prophecies of fire, plague, famine, floods, earthquakes, droughts, comets, brutal occupations and bloody oppressions. The Church would collapse, the Pope be forced to flee Rome. Such predictions made it extremely popular at the time of the French Revolution, when crowds besieged the French Biblioth√®que Nationale to see it. Indeed, many nineteenth-century catalogues suggested that it had predicted the Revolution itself. But above all the book predicted a supposedly imminent Arab invasion of Europe, the advent of the Antichrist and the subsequent End of the World.

The population in 2011 was 17,131Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica (of which approximately 10,000 are in the town of R√©gua), in an area of km¬≤. History A historic train in the railway station of Peso da R√©gua Peso da R√©gua was inhabited by Roman and barbarian invasions during the early part of the settled history. Its name, as historians have suggested, developed from a few places: first, the name Vila Reggula a Roman estate that at one time existed near the historic centre; others suggest it originated from the word r√©cua (the ships that plied the waters along the Douro); or derived the word reguengo (a designation for lands that were attributed to the monarchy). Peso da R√©gua may also have its origin in the word regra (), alluding to the hereditary rights of descendants achieved through forals. This theory is based on the donated of lands by Counts Henrique and Hugo in 1093, which were transferred to Egas Moniz. It is likely that this rule gave origin to the word R√©goa, and later R√©gua. In relation to the first word, Peso, there are two opinions on its origin: the first, defends the it was derived from the place where the weighing of goods existed, or where taxes were levied; or, secondly, that the word was probably used to define the placed where animals were fed (), or Penso. Middle Ages Peso de R√©gua received its foral from King Sancho I, who conferred on the locality of Godim the municipal charter. On 3 February 1837, Peso da R√©gua was elevated to the status of vila (), which included the annexed municipality of Godim, the civil parishes of Godim, Loureiro, Fontelas, Moura Morta and Sedielos. Its important role as municipality only achieved its zenith in 1836, after the Marquess of Pombal designated the Douro, its vineyards and wine, as a quality brand for export. This was helped through the creation of Companhia Geral das Vinhas do Alto Douro, in 1756, which delimited the vineyards of the Douro Valley by granite markers () to regulate the vineyards and wines produced. After this point, through commercialization and centralization, R√©goa began to become the centre of the region. On 31 December 1859, due to the extinction of the municipality of Canelas, the parishes of Poiares, Covelinhas, Vilarinho de Freires and Galafura were added to the municipality. Republic On 11 December 1933, the parish of Vinhos was created from the de-annexed region of Sedielos, resulting in a municipality of eleven parishes threaded along the Douro. Within the integration of Canelas, in 1976, the municipality grew to twelve. Peso da R√©gua was elevated to city on 14 August 1985. In 1988, the Office Internacional de la Vigne et du Vin recognized the municipality as the Cidade Internacional da Vinha e do Vinho (). Geography The Douro River valley running through the headlands of Peso da R√©gua The terraced lands along the Douro River, with vineyards growing: the municipality was recognized as the International City of Vineyards and Wine in 1988 Administratively, the municipality is divided into 8 civil parishes (freguesias): * Fontelas * Galafura e Covelinhas * Loureiro * Moura Morta e Vinh√≥s * Peso da R√©gua e Godim * Poiares e Canelas * Sedielos * Vilarinho dos Freires Economy It cannot be expressed how important Port Wine helped to catapult the fortunes of Peso da R√©gua: Tourist boats ply the river from this point carrying tourists through the locks of two dams to R√©gua. The town is also connected to Porto by train; the Douro railway line runs along the banks of the Douro. Until its closure in 2009, the narrow gauge railway of the Corgo line also served the town.

As a key member of Unit 101, he was highly praised by Chief of Staff Moshe Dayan who described him as \\"the finest of our commando soldiers, the best soldier ever to emerge in the IDF\\".Morris, Benny (1993) Israel's Border Wars, 1949‚Äì1956. Arab Infiltration, Israeli Retaliation, and the Countdown to the Suez War. Oxford University Press, . Page Ariel Sharon described him as \\"the elite of the elite.\\"Ariel Sharon, with David Chanoff; Warrior: The Autobiography of Ariel Sharon, Simon & Schuster, 2001, p. 110. His three-year military career was ended by injuries sustained in battle. The character of Ari Ben-Canaan in Leon Uris's novel Exodus is generally believed to have been based on Har-Zion. Early life Har-Zion was born in Herzliya in 1934, and was a third generation sabra. His mother, Sarah Goldenberg, had been born in Rishon LeZion to a mother who had been born in Jerusalem to a Sephardi-Jewish family originally from ƒ∞zmir and a father who had been born in Romania and moved to Palestine with his parents as a child. Har-Zion's father, Eliyahu Horowitz, had moved to Palestine from Russia. When Har-Zion was three years old, the family moved to Rishpon, where his two sisters Shoshana and Rachel were born. When he was 14, his parents divorced, and Har-Zion moved to kibbutz Ein Harod with his father while his mother and sisters moved to kibbutz Beit Alfa. As a child, Har-Zion spent much of his free time watching nature and taking walks, sometimes crossing the borders of Palestine. In 1949, he was briefly detained by Syrian authorities together with his 13-year-old sister, Shoshana, after being caught in Syrian territory east of Beit She'an. In 1951, two years later, they were both captured by a shepherd while on the Syrian side of the border. This time they were held prisoner in Damascus, and the two children were only released by the Syrian government after a month of negotiation by the UN and the governments of both countries, making international headlines.Elon, Amos The Israelis. Founders and Sons. p. 232.Davar, ◊ë◊†◊ï◊ë◊û◊ë◊® 1951 Being the children of divorced parents, Meir and his younger sister Shoshana had developed a deep emotional bond with each other, and had become extremely close, often illegally crossing into neighbouring Arab countries together.Ariel Sharon, with David Chanoff; Warrior: The Autobiography of Ariel Sharon, Simon & Schuster, 2001, p. 111. During the 1950s around a dozen Israeli teenagers were killed attempting to illegally reach the ancient city of Petra, which is located 40 km inside Jordan. Such cross-border treks were considered a rite of passage for elite youth. The song \\"HaSela HaAdom\\" (The Red Rock), which praised a group killed attempting the trek, was banned.Morris. p. 239. At the age of 18, Meir and his girlfriend managed to reach Petra at night, after three days of hiking, crossing Wadi Musa, climbing Mount Hor and bypassing an unpassable waterfall: they apparently slipped into the ancient city unnoticed, under the cover of darkness, before exploring the Nabatean vestiges. This feat made them legendary figures amongst the Israeli youth of the time, for whom Petra had represented an impenetrable citadel.◊®◊ê◊ï◊ë◊ü ◊ï◊ï◊ô◊°, ◊û◊ô◊™◊ï◊° ◊î◊°◊ú◊¢ ◊î◊ê◊ì◊ï◊ù ◊û◊™◊†◊§◊• ynet \\"We had only a compass and a map on a small scale, but that was definitely enough to find our way to Petra,\\" Har-Zion recalled.The Lure of The Trail, by Yadin Roman, ERETZ ‚Äì The magazine of ISRAEL ‚Äì No. 96 November‚ÄìDecember 2004  Unit 101  In 1953 he was one of the founding members of Unit 101. He took part in the unit's first operation at the end of August 1953. Sixteen men with two jeeps, two command cars and a reconnaissance aircraft attacked the 'Azazme bedouin camps around the wells at al Auja. Their tents were burnt and anything attempting to reach the water was shot at.Teveth, Shabtai (1974) Moshe Dayan. The soldier, the man, the legend. Quartet Books. . p. 243. Morris, p. 244, has 14 men in group. On the night of 14‚Äì15 October 1953 around 65 men from Unit 101 joined a larger IDF force in an attack on the village of Qibya, in what became known as the Qibya massacre. Har-Zion commanded one of three squads sent to ambush any reinforcements coming from Ni'lin, Budrus, and Shuqba.Morris. p. 246. In another night-time attack, 18‚Äì19 December 1953, two Unit 101 squads led by Har-Zion ambushed a car on the Bethlehem to Hebron road. A Lebanese-born doctor serving in the Arab Legion, Mansour Awad, was killed. The Israeli Prime Minister Moshe Sharett was annoyed that he had not been informed about the attack beforehand. Three nights later Har-Zion led a four man squad on a 21-kilometre march to the outskirts of Hebron.Morris. p. 293. Other missions that Har-Zion took part in included Operation Black Arrow and Operation Elkayam.  890th Paratroop Battalion  Meir Har-Zion, 1954 Meir Har-Zion, 1954 The following year, 26 May 1954, Har-Zion was amongst a ten-man squad from the newly formed 890th Paratroop Battalion, led by its commander Ariel Sharon, which carried out a raid near Khirbet Jinba, south west of Hebron. Two National Guardsmen were killed in an ambush as well as two farmers and two camels. Sharett once again complained about not being informed and suspected that Minister of Defence Pinhas Lavon had not been consulted either.Morris. pp. 305, 306. On 27‚Äì28 June 1954 Har-Zion was in a seven man squad led by Major Aharon Davidi that launched a surprise attack on an Arab Legion camp at Azzun, 13 km east of Qalqilya. Three Legionnaires were killed as well as a farmer, Rafi'a Abdel Aziz Omar, who was stabbed to death by Har- Zion to prevent him raising the alarm. On their return to Israeli lines one of the team who had been wounded, Sergeant Yitzhak Jibli, was left behind.Morris. p. 307. Burns, Lieutenant-General E.L.M. (1962) Between Arab and Israeli.

On their way back they killed a farmer watching his fields.Teveth. p. 253 describes the prisoner as a Jordanian soldier. Burns. pp. 36, 37. On the 30‚Äì31 August 1954 Har-Zion took part in Operation Binyamin 2. This operation was approved by Prime Minister Moshe Sharett and was commanded by Ariel Sharon. The attackers were divided into four groups. The first attacked a school building in the village of Beit Liqya. The other three set ambushes for the expected arrival of reinforcements. Only Har-Zion's group were successful. They had strung a wire across the road with cans of petrol at each end. A car full of soldiers from the Arab Legion drove into the trap. Two were killed, one wounded and three taken prisoner.Morris. p. 310. Burns. p. 37 and 17 for description of technique. Sergeant Yitzhak Jibli was released on 29 October 1954, four months after being wounded and captured.  The Har-Zion Affair  In the middle of February 1955 Har-Zion's sister, Shoshana, along with her boyfriend Oded Wegmeister from Degania Bet, both 18, were captured, abused and murdered by Bedouin tribesmen from Wadi al-Ghar (the central section of the stream called in Hebrew Nahal Arugot, which ends at Ein Gedi)Political Assassinations by Jews: A Rhetorical Device for Justice, By Na·∏•mƒÅn Ben-Yƒïh√ªdƒÅ, p. 443, SUNY Press, 1993 while on an illegal cross-border hike across the Judean desert on Jordanian territory. When he heard of her death, Har-Zion was inconsolable and vowed revenge. On March 4, he and three ex-members of the 890th Battalion drove to the Armistice Line with Jordan. In Wadi al-Ghar, 9 km from the border, they captured six Bedouin from the Jahaleen and 'Azazme tribes. The prisoners were interrogated and five of them killed, four with knives and the fifth was shot. One of the dead was 16 years old. The sixth was sent back to his tribe to tell what happened. The men probably had nothing to do with the killing of Har-Zion's sister, and had merely belonged to the same tribes as the murderers. David Ben-Gurion told the cabinet that the Israelis did not know enough Arabic to understand what their prisoners were saying. Sharon wrote that it was \\"the kind of ritual revenge the Bedouins understood perfectly. But the repercussions of what Har-Zion had done were very 20th century. The Jordanians made a formal complaint to the UN.\\"Ariel Sharon, with David Chanoff; Warrior: The Autobiography of Ariel Sharon, Simon & Schuster, 2001, p. 112. On their return, Har-Zion and three of his companions were held in custody for 20 days. They were released without charge, as a result of protection and stonewalling by them and their colleagues in the army, and soon rejoined their old unit. Sharett, who suspected that Dayan had advance knowledge of the raid, and who deplored such actions, noted critically in his diary: \\"The dark soul of the Bible has come alive among the sons of Nahalal and 'Ein Harod\\".Morris. pp. 384‚Äì86. End of career Operation Jonathan, 11‚Äì12 September 1956,YEARBOOK OF THE UNITED NATIONS 1956 was an attack by two paratroop companies on Khirbet al-Rahwa police fort, on the Hebron‚ÄìBeersheba road, in which over 20 Jordanian soldiers and policemen were killed. During the fighting Har-Zion was wounded in the throat and arm. His life was saved by an army doctor who performed a tracheotomy using his pocket-knife while still under fire.Morris. p. 393. Teveth. pp. 243, 244.Dayan, Moshe (1965) Diary of the Sinai Campaign 1956. Sphere Books edition (1967) p. 32. \\"He was gravely wounded, the bullet striking his windpipe, but his life was saved by the medical officer of the unit, who crawled to him under fire and performed a tracheotomy with his pocket knife.\\" The injuries left Har-Zion unable to continue his army career. He was awarded the Medal of Courage. He had attained the rank of Captain. 1967 and 1973 wars During the 1967 Six-Day War, Har- Zion was called up as captain in the reserves, and despite the use of only one hand, took part alongside the paratroopers in the battle for the Old City of Jerusalem. In one important exploit in the battle, he killed a Jordanian sniper who had been holding up the Israeli advance: after stalking the sniper across a roof-top, he killed him with hand-grenades.The Israeli Army in the Middle East Wars, 1948‚Äì73, By John Laffin, Osprey Publishing, 21 Aug 2012 Har- Zion served again as a captain during the Yom Kippur War, on the Golan front, in which he fought deep inside Syrian territory and rescued injured soldiers behind enemy lines.  Writing career  In 1969 he published his diaries which gave an account of his time as a paratrooper.Har-Zion, Meir Pirkei Yoman. (Hebrew: Chapters of a diary), Tel Aviv, Levin-Epstein.

The great Heisei merger All other towns and villages from Higashimatsuura District were incorporated into Karatsu between 2005 and 2006. Genkai originally planned to merge into Karatsu with the rest of the district, but was concerned about the slow administrative response of the surrounding areas. Eventually they withdrew their decision to merge and decided to continue as an autonomous municipality. Genkai is now enjoying a relatively high amount of revenue from the Genkai Nuclear Power Plant, built in 1975, but there is a question as to its administration in the future.

Geography Tara is bordered by Isahaya, ≈åmura, Kashima and the Ariake Sea. On a clear day, it is possible to see the mountains across the sea. Tara includes Mount Tara and Mount Kyoga, which are two of the highest mountains in Ky≈´sh≈´ and part of the Tara Mountains. Tara is composed of two traditional ‚Äî and to a lesser extent, linguistic ‚Äî sections, which were once independent towns: Tara (Â§öËâØ) and ≈åura (Â§ßÊµ¶). Tara is located quite close to the Kashima Gatalympics, which takes place near Hizen-Iida station. Aerial view of ≈åura bay≈åura harbor is the main port of entry via sea. Significant locations Famous, tourist, and historic sites of note include: ;Kinsenji (temple) :Once had influence on shrines throughout Ky≈´sh≈´, though it is now literally a shell of its former glory (see legends below) ;Takezaki Kanze Onji (temple) :Culturally one of the most influential areas in Tara (see festivals, below) ;Tara Takezaki onsen :One of the few sources of tourism in modern times ;Shirahama beach; :Small and littered with sharp shells, yet facilities exist and a sea-center is close by with recreational activities such as jet-skiing ;Kenkou no Mori Park (\\"forest of health\\") :A fairly large park in the middle of the mountains ;Camp Nakayama :Camping ground with cabins (open for a short period each year) and a trail to Mount Tara and other important areas in the Tara mountains ; and the Tara mountains :Mount Tara is one of the tallest mountains in Ky≈´sh≈´. ; :Taller than mount Tara, making it the tallest in the prefecture. If one is traveling by car, it is more readily accessible from Kashima or ≈åmura, though a ridgeline exists between it and mount Tara that hikers often use. ;Takezaki Castle Ruins :Degraded into not much more than a wall; its purpose was once to be a lookout for invasions from Nagasaki ;Takezaki Castle Observatory :Re-creation of the original Takezaki Castle, this tall structure is at the edge of the peninsula overlooking the sea ;Lighthouse Ruins :Reduced to a memorial stone History *May 1, 1889 ‚Äî the boundaries of the villages known as Tara, ≈åura, and Nanaura were established. *February 11, 1955 ‚Äî Tara and ≈åura became one town, Tara-ch≈ç. *March 1, 1955 ‚Äî a section of Nanaura was absorbed into Tara-ch≈ç. History Due to influence from Nagasaki, Christianity existed in the area, but after the results of the Shimabara Rebellion, most of the Christians were killed or went underground and became Kakure Kirishitans. The only evidence remaining is grave stones that are scattered throughout Tara. Legends Local legend has it that a force from the south once tried to invade Tara. The villagers wore demon masks to scare the intruders, and won the skirmish. Another local legend originating in the 9th century is that of a handsome warrior-monk, Takeno Shintaro, whose looks so charmed the ladies that they sang a song whenever he came down from the mountains. The lyrics of the song ask for him to fall and break his leg so that he would have to stay among the women. Women could not go into the mountains at that time in history because of the mountains' sacred nature. The mountains themselves were worshiped as the realm of gods (at this time the local belief was that gods were another step along a buddha's progression), and the temple at Mount Tara, Kinsen-ji, had authority over more than 70 shrines in Ky≈´sh≈´. However, under the Meiji restoration, the god-buddha connection became taboo and today Kinsen-ji lies in disrepair. During 1780, a song named \\"Zanza-bushi\\" spread through Japan. Saga people adapted the melody and used it to recreate the song \\"Takeno Shintaro-san\\". The first two stanzas: There is a legend about the origins of the Doro Mochi Tsuki festival (see festivals section below). In the legend, set about 200 years ago, the village was poor. On occasion of the village elder being away on a pilgrimage, the town's people all had the same dream. In the mysterious dream, an itinerant monk came to the village as they were discussing how to pray for rain and in hunger stole some mochi. The villagers blamed him and killed him. Out of regret, they buried him. Rain fell upon the place where he was buried. The villagers believed the rain was due to the monk, and offered mochi to him, thus starting the traditional festival. Festivals and religious occasions There are many festivals in Tara, some with history spanning back hundreds of years. These are listed below, in order of date. *January 2 - January 3, : A hadaka matsuri at Takezaki Kanzeon temple wherein men dressed in loincloths try to stop a man dressed as an oni, who carries a box. The men then pull at the oni and shred the red kimono the oni wears. There is also a dance by boys in costumes. *January 8, : This matsuri is an archery event in the Ochiy≈çzu district in which the participants wield bows and arrows made out of green bamboo. Words like \\"east\\", \\"west\\", \\"south\\", \\"north\\" and \\"oni\\" are written on the targets. 33,333 arrows are said to be shot metaphorically, though the actual number is much less. 3 is a number that carries connotations of innocent omens in the festival, therefore the figure. *Mid January, : A children's festival at Takezaki Kanzeon temple in which they take round straw mats and pierce them with long spears. Then they take the luck of the new year upon themselves and make wishes. *January 14, : A children‚Äôs festival in which they go around carrying sticks with straw wrapped around the end. They chant, \\"!\\", a ritual saying, as they strike the ground in unison. This drives away bad luck and invites fortune. This type of festival happens in other places in Japan. *April 1, : To honor their ancestors, people dress as white foxes and perform a synchronized dance. *Mid May, : A Buddhist ceremony in Takezaki Kanzeon temple and around the coast that appeases the force in charge of the catch and prays for a safe fishing season. During the ceremony a monk travels along the coast, ringing gongs and beating drums, while chanting a sutra in honor of a bodhi ancestor that is interred at Takezaki Kanzeon temple. This ceremony is more than 400 years old. *End of July, beginning of August : At night the town gathers on Michikoshi beach and dances, O-bon-style, in a giant ring. Many people wear yukata. There are also fireworks. This is a relatively new festival, but arguably the biggest in Tara. Many events happen at the same time, and traditional matsuri stands are set up, allowing access to festival foods and games. *2nd Saturday and Sunday of September, : At Tara-dake Shrine and throughout Tara for a few weeks, people give thanks for (and for ensuring for the prosperity of another) a big harvest. People excitedly dance around in black outfits and wear oni masks. They also carry drums and cymbals and beat taiko drums. This is said to be the oldest of Tara's festivals and traditions. *September 22, : A muddy, mochi-pounding festival at Itoki Kabuta, in which men wearing fundoshi battle each other on a slippery mud field of red-clay while pounding mochi (see above for origins of this matsuri). The muddy mochi made in the event is then offered on a plate to a statue of Yakushi Nyorai. Other Events *January 4, : To celebrate the return of spring, runners from Tara and other places gather in front of Tara elementary school and run a marathon. *July 10: Shirahama beach officially opens *July 21: Camp Nakayama opens to the public. *End of July through the beginning of August, . Held in Tagori, kids come from all over Japan to have their pet beetles fight in little rings on the tops of logs. The beetle that falls of the log loses. Discontinued Festivals and traditions Some festivals have recently stopped being performed, or are rarely observed anymore. Among them are: the cucumber festival, in which cucumbers were piled in hopes of blessings such as safety and babies, and the demon fires events, in which large bonfires were made. Industry Seaweed-gathering nets in the Ariake Sea Tara was once a thriving tourist destination, but as Japan's economy has slowed down, so has Tara's. Most young people relocate to the larger cities when they become adults. Tara is on a main railroad line and traversed by route 207 (see transportation below), and benefits somewhat from the tourism this brings. As a result, many people in Tara are opposed to new train lines that would make commerce through Tara all but obsolete. However planning has gone ahead, and Tara has received a payoff to compensate. It is regionally famous for its crabs (of the wanigani variety), mikans, and oysters, the latter of which is in season during the winter. During oyster (or kaki) season, it is common for people to come from surrounding prefectures and enjoy grilled kaki. Many restaurants have special, bare-bones plastic and wood sections that are only open during this season. Most of such business happens on the weekends, and this is also a good business time for the local farmer's market. Other industry in Tara includes animal husbandry, especially chicken farms, and forestry. But Tara's most profitable industry probably lies in the surrounding sea. Besides fishing and marine life, Tara boasts thousands of nori collecting poles and nets. Education Tara has one prefectural highschool, Tara High School (‰ΩêË≥ÄÁúåÁ´ãÂ§™ËâØÈ´òÁ≠âÂ≠¶Ê†°), and two junior high schools. There are also two elementary schools and scattered kindergartens. Transportation Most travelers come to Tara by National Route 207 or via the Nagasaki Main Line, operated by JR Kyushu. Stations Tara is serviced by the JR Kyushu railroad company. It has two stations and one switchbox. *Nagasaki Main Line **Tara Station **Hizen-≈åura Station Air The closest airport is Saga Airport, followed by one in Nagasaki. Most travelers go to Fukuoka Airport for travel abroad. Roads National Route 207 runs through the length of the town, and is the only road to Nagasaki Prefecture. The mountains are seeded with small roads, many of them one lane and unpaved. A road leads from camp Nakayama towards Kashima and Ureshino. Sea While fishing is a huge industry, there is no known sea travel, nor are there ferries available.

His eldest brother is Richard Smith, the medical doctor, editor and businessman. His younger brother is Nick Smith, a civil servant who for a period of time was also a stand-up comic, but in more recent years has turned to amateur dramatics.

He then studied at the University of East Anglia where he was chairman of the poetry society, wrote for the student newspaper and contributed sketches for the student revue. He graduated with a 2:1 BA degree in Comparative literature in 1976. Arthurian legend returns to his comic roots at UAE. Retrieved 8 October 2013 Career Smith was one of many stand-up performers on the alternative comedy scene in the 1980s, and still performs today in much the same manner. He has regularly attended the Edinburgh Fringe comedy festival since 1977, and still comperes the long-running Hackney Empire New Act of the Year competition final. He has also written a body of serious or semi-serious work, including stage plays such as An Evening with Gary Lineker. In addition to stand-up comedy, Smith has performed musical comedy shows such as Arthur Smith Sings Leonard Cohen (later broadcast on Radio 4). He returned to this theme for the Edinburgh Fringe in 2013 with \\"Arthur Smith Sings Leonard Cohen (Volume Too). He is also a radio presenter on such BBC Radio 4 programmes as Excess Baggage and Loose Ends, and appears on television comedy panel games. He took over as narrator of the TV series A Life of Grime after the death of John Peel and was one of the Grumpy Old Men in the television series of that name. Both of the latter two series used \\"What a Wonderful World\\" as their theme song. For Grumpy Old Men, Smith was one of the cast members who contributed to a montage rendition of the song. One of Smith's routines has been set to music by Mark Beazley, aka Rothko, for a CD curated by comedian and writer Stewart Lee. The CD, The Topography of Chance was guest-curated by Stewart for the Sonic Arts Network and Arthur's track is called I've seen your arse and contains extra vocals by Caroline Quentin taken from a live recording of Smith's show, Arthur Smith's Last Hangover. In December 1985, Smith, along with temporary comedy partner Phil Nice, made a short series of parody documentaries for Channel 4 television network called Arthur and Phil Go Off. One episode, titled \\"Nessie ‚Äì Real or Pretend\\" about the Loch Ness Monster, was aired in America on the A&E; cable channel in 1986. None of these shows has officially been released to any video format. During the late 1980s, Smith took the role of consumer expert, testing such items as hangover cures and Pot Noodles on the BBC Radio 2 Nightcap show hosted by Peter Dickson. In 1989, Smith provided voices for an Aardman Animations short called Ident with Nice and later. In 1989 he appeared in The Bill (Quiet life). In the mid and late 1990s, he lent his voice to some television animations including the TV short The Animal Train as Jim Jam (with veteran voice actor Rick Jones voicing the character in the USA version), the BBC clay animated series Rex the Runt (also made by Aardman) as Arthur Dustcart in five episodes and the British-French children's animated series Romuald the Reindeer as the big bully Clint. One of Smith's more unusual roles was in the sitcom Red Dwarf in the episode \\"Backwards\\". He plays a bar manager on backwards Earth who has hired Kryten and Rimmer as a forward novelty act. He gave a speech (in reverse) blaming Kryten and Rimmer for starting a fight. If, however, the speech is played forwards, he is heard to be insulting the listener who has flipped the recording over trying to find out what he was saying (\\"What a poor sad life he's got\\"). Smith being sent off during a charity football match in 2010 A night in watching football with Tony Hawks ended with him challenging Hawks to beat the entire Moldovan football team at tennis. Hawks took him up on this bet, and wrote a bookHawks, T. Playing the Moldovans at Tennis () about it. Hawks won the bet, and Smith had to stand on Balham High Road and sing the Moldovan National Anthem whilst naked. Smith also appeared in a cameo role in the first series of the BBC science fiction radio comedy Married. He played a version of himself from a parallel universe who eked out a living as a children's party entertainer. This role expanded in the second and third series.

Awards In 2005, Smith turned down a lifetime achievement award from the Perrier Award organisers. He said that \\"Comedians rather dislike the Perrier Awards and the public aren't interested. Basically, they wanted to tell me I was old and cool; well, I know that already, and anyway, my ego is bloated enough.\\" In 2007 he went on to win the Panel Prize at the Edinburgh Fringe. In 2010, he was a Malcolm Hardee Cunning Stunt Award nominee for best publicity stunt at the Edinburgh Fringe after declaring that he would pay ¬£100 to any journalist attending his show who would juggle fish.

By 1986, Deep Rover had been tested and Earle joined the team conducting training off Lee Stocking Island in the Bahamas. Earle left the company in 1990 to accept an appointment as Chief Scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, where she stayed until 1992. She was the first woman to hold that position. During this post, given her expertise on the impact of oil spills, Earle was called upon to lead several research trips during the Persian Gulf War in 1991 to determine the environmental damage caused by Iraq's destruction of Kuwaiti oil wells. In 1992, Earle founded Deep Ocean Exploration and Research (DOER Marine) to further advance marine engineering. The company, now run by Earle's daughter Elizabeth; designs, builds, and operates equipment for deep-ocean environments.Earle (2009) Since 1998, Earle has been a National Geographic Explorer-in-Residence. She is sometimes called \\"Her Deepness\\" or \\"The Sturgeon General\\". From 1998 to 2002, she led the Sustainable Seas Expeditions, a five- year program sponsored by the National Geographic Society and funded by the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund to study the United States National Marine Sanctuary. During this time, Earle was a leader of the Sustainable Seas Expeditions, council chair for the Harte Research Institute for the Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M-Corpus; Christi, and chair of the Advisory Council for the Ocean in Google Earth. She also provided the DeepWorker 2000 submersible used to quantify the species of fish as well as the space resources utilized within the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. In 2001, Earle received the National Parks Conservation Association's Robin W. Winks Award for Enhancing Public Understanding of National Parks. Earle founded Mission Blue (also known as the Sylvia Earle Alliance, Deep Search Foundation, and Deep Search) in 2009. Given her past experience with the Exxon Valdez and Mega Borg oil spills, Earle was called to consult during the Deepwater Horizon Disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. During this year she also gave a 14-minute speech in front of 3,500 delegates and United Nations ambassadors at The Hague International Model United Nations Conference. In July 2012, Earle led an expedition to NOAA's Aquarius underwater laboratory, located off Key Largo, Florida. The expedition, entitled \\"Celebrating 50 Years of Living Beneath The Sea\\", commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of Jacques Cousteau's Conshelf I project and investigated coral reefs and ocean health. Mark Patterson co-led the expedition with Earle. Their aquanaut team also included underwater filmmaker D.J. Roller and oceanographer M. Dale Stokes. Earle made a cameo appearance in the daily cartoon strip Sherman's Lagoon in the week starting September 17, 2012, to discuss the closing of the Aquarius Underwater Laboratory.This Week in Comics: What To Read Daily Ink Retrieved September 18, 2012 In May 2013, the Science Laureates of the United States Act of 2013 (H.R. 1891; 113th Congress) was introduced into Congress. Earle was listed by one commentator as a possible nominee for the position of Science Laureate, if the act were to pass. In January 2018, the Seattle Aquarium granted its inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award to Earle and renamed the Seattle Aquarium Medal in her honor. The Aquarium's first Lifetime Achievement Award was awarded to Earle.https://www.seattleaquarium.org/document.doc?id=2474 Alongside her work at Mission Blue, she also serves on several boards, including the Marine Conservation Institute.Marine Conservation Institute With TED's support, she launched Mission Blue, which aims to establish marine protected areas (dubbed \\"Hope Spots\\") around the globe. Mission Blue's vision is to achieve 30% protection of the ocean by 2030, and more than two hundred organisations have supported them in this mission to date (2019). These supporters range from large, global companies to small, bespoke research teams. With Mission Blue and its partners, Earle leads expeditions to Hope Spots around the globe. Past expeditions include Cuba in 2009, Belize in January 2010, the Gal√°pagos Islands in April 2010, Costa Rica and the Central American Dome in early 2014 and the South African Coast in late 2014. In August 2014, a Netflix exclusive documentary titled 'Mission Blue' was released. It focuses on Earle's life and career as her Mission Blue campaign to create a global network of marine protected areas. The organization has continued to grow with Earle's work and the help of her team. As of 2020, Mission Blue has created 122 Hope Spots around the world.

Both single and dual processor configurations were implemented. Intel switched back to the traditional socket interface with Socket 370 in 1999.  General  With the introduction of the Pentium II CPU, the need for greater access for testing had made the transition from socket to slot necessary. Previously with the Pentium Pro, Intel had combined processor and cache dies in the same Socket 8 package. These were connected by a full-speed bus, resulting in significant performance benefits. Unfortunately, this method required that the two components be bonded together early in the production process, before testing was possible. As a result, a single, tiny flaw in either die made it necessary to discard the entire assembly, causing low production yield and high cost.Pentium_Pro#An_innovation_in_cache Intel subsequently designed a circuit board where the CPU and cache remained closely integrated, but were mounted on a printed circuit board, called a Single-Edged Contact Cartridge (SECC). The CPU and cache could be tested separately, before final assembly into a package, reducing cost and making the CPU more attractive to markets other than that of high-end servers. These cards could also be easily plugged into a Slot 1, thereby eliminating the chance for pins of a typical CPU to be bent or broken when installing in a socket. The form factor used for Slot 1 was a 5-inch-long, 242-contact edge connector named SC242. To prevent the cartridge from being inserted the wrong way, the slot was keyed to allow installation in only one direction. The SC242 was later used for AMD's Slot A as well, and while the two slots were identical mechanically, they were electrically incompatible. To discourage Slot A users from trying to install a Slot 1 CPU, the connector was rotated 180 degrees on Slot A motherboards. With the new Slot 1, Intel added support for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP). A maximum of two Pentium II or Pentium III CPUs can be used in a dual slot motherboard. The Celeron does not have official SMP support. There are also converter cards, known as Slotkets, which hold a Socket 8 so that a Pentium Pro CPU can be used with Slot 1 motherboards.Experience of Pentium Pro on Slot 1 motherboard usage These specific converters, however, are rare. Another kind of slotket allows using a Socket 370 CPU in a Slot 1. Many of these latter devices are equipped with own voltage regulator modules, in order to supply the new CPU with a lower core voltage, which the motherboard would not otherwise allow.  Form factors  Intel Pentium II CPU in SECC form factor Pentium III (Katmai) in SECC2: CPU at center, two chips at right are cache Celeron in SEPP: CPU at center (under heat spreader), surrounding chips are resistors and bypass capacitors The Single Edge Contact Cartridge, or \\"SECC\\", was used at the beginning of the Slot 1-era for Pentium II CPUs. Inside the cartridge, the CPU itself is enclosed in a hybrid plastic and metal case. The back of the housing is plastic and has several markings on it: the name, \\"Pentium II\\"; the Intel logo; a hologram; and the model number. The front consists of a black anodized aluminum plate, which is used to hold the CPU cooler. The SECC form is very solid, because the CPU itself is resting safely inside the case. As compared to socket-based CPUs, there are no pins that can be bent, and the CPU is less likely to be damaged by improper installation of a cooler. Following SECC, the SEPP-form (Single Edge Processor Package) appeared on the market. It was designed for lower-priced Celeron CPUs. This form lacks a case entirely, consisting solely of the printed-circuit board holding the components. A form factor called SECC2 was used for late Pentium II and Pentium III CPUs for Slot 1, which was created to accommodate the switch to flip chip packaging.http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/overclocking-special,94-2.html Only the front plate was carried over, the coolers were now mounted straight to the PCB and exposed CPU die and are, as such, incompatible with SECC cartridges.  History  Historically, there are three platforms for the Intel P6-CPUs: Socket 8, Slot 1 and Socket 370. Slot 1 is a successor to Socket 8. While the Socket 8 CPUs (Pentium Pro) directly had the L2-cache embedded into the CPU, it is located (outside of the core) on a circuit board shared with the core itself. The exception is later Slot 1 CPUs with the Coppermine core which have the L2-Cache embedded into the die. In the beginning of 2000, while the Pentium-III-CPUs with FC-PGA-housing appeared, Slot 1 was slowly succeeded by Socket 370, after Intel had already offered Socket 370 and Slot 1 at the same time since the beginning of 1999. Socket 370 was initially made for the low-cost Celeron processors, while Slot 1 was thought of as a platform for the expensive Pentium II and early Pentium III models. Cache and core were both embedded into the die. Slot 1 also obsoleted the old Socket 7, at least regarding Intel, as the standard platform for the home-user. After superseding the Intel P5 Pentium MMX CPU, Intel completely left the Socket 7 market.

Islam is the state and major religion of the country. Geography Nature in Ras Elhelal. In its southern part is the fertile upland area of Jebel Akhdar. North of this is a dry, sub-desert area between the uplands and the Mediterranean on its northern edge. Libya has mostly a flat undulating plain and occasional plateau, with an average elevation of around . Around 91 per cent of the land is covered by desert, with only 8.8 per cent agricultural land (with only 1% arable lands) and 0.1 per cent of forests. The major resources are petroleum, gypsum and natural gas. Along the coastal regions, the climate is Mediterranean in coastal areas, while it is desert climate in all other parts. Dust storms lasting four to eight days is pretty common during Spring. Triplotania is the northwest region, while it is Cyrenacia in the east and Fezzen in southwest. Cyrenacia is the largest region in Libya, which is mostly semi arid in nature. The region receives an annual rainfall of . There are no perennial rivers in the region, but the region is abundant with groundwater aquifers. Administration The same district between 2001 and 2007. Libya became independent in 1951 from the colonial empire and generally known for its oil-rich resources. All the powers rested centrally with the Brotherly Leader Gaddafi, for 42 years till the 2011 armed rebellion which topple him. As per the constitution, Libya is the most decentralized Arab nation, but practically all powers are vested on central government on account of control over the oil revenues. Local governmental institutions manage the administration of education, industry, and communities. As a part of decentralization in 2012, the country is administratively split into 13 regions from the original 25 municipalities, which were further divided in 1,500 communes. Since 2015, the chief of the state is a chairman of Presidential Council, while the prime minister is the head of the state. The House of Representatives is an elected body that is elected on universal suffrage and popular vote. As of 2016, there were 22 administrative divisions in the country in the form of districts.

In art history, \\"Old Master\\" (or \\"old master\\")The term is spelled either way in the literature. Major UK and US dictionaries, incl. the Oxford Online Dictionaries, American Heritage Dictionary, Macmillan, Cambridge, and Random House dictionaries use lowercase; Oxford English Dictionary, Collins, and Merriam-Webster dictionaries also mention the uppercase spelling.Old Masters Department, Christies.com. refers to any painter of skill who worked in Europe before about 1800, or a painting by such an artist. An \\"old master print\\" is an original print (for example an engraving or etching) made by an artist in the same period. The term \\"old master drawing\\" is used in the same way. In theory, \\"Old Master\\" applies only to artists who were fully trained, were Masters of their local artists' guild, and worked independently, but in practice, paintings produced by pupils or workshops are often included in the scope of the term. Therefore, beyond a certain level of competence, date rather than quality is the criterion for using the term. Period covered In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the term was often understood as having a starting date of perhaps 1450 or 1470; paintings made before that were \\"primitives\\", but this distinction is no longer made. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the term as \\"A pre-eminent artist of the period before the modern; esp. a pre-eminent western European painter of the 13th to 18th centuries.\\" The first quotation given is from 1696, in the diary of John Evelyn: \\"My L: Pembroke..shewed me divers rare Pictures of very many of the old & best Masters, especially that of M: Angelo..,& a large booke of the best drawings of the old Masters.\\"\\"old master, n. and adj.\\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, December 2016. Web. The term is also used to refer to a painting or sculpture made by an Old Master, a usage datable to 1824. There are comparable terms in Dutch, French and German; the Dutch may have been the first to make use of such a term, in the 18th century, when oude meester mostly meant painters of the Dutch Golden Age of the previous century. Les Maitres d'autrefois of 1876 by Eugene Fromentin may have helped to popularize the concept, although \\"vieux maitres\\" is also used in French. The famous collection in Dresden at the Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister is one of the few museums to include the term in its actual name, although many more use it in the title of departments or sections. The collection in the Dresden museum essentially stops at the Baroque period. The end date is necessarily vague ‚Äì for example, Goya (1746‚Äì1828) is certainly an Old Master, though he was still painting and printmaking at his death in 1828. The term might also be used for John Constable (1776‚Äì1837) or Eug√®ne Delacroix (1798‚Äì1868), but usually is not. The term tends to be avoided by art historians as too vague, especially when discussing paintings, although the terms \\"Old Master Prints\\" and \\"Old Master drawings\\" are still used. It remains current in the art trade. Auction houses still usually divide their sales between, for example, \\"Old Master Paintings\\", \\"Nineteenth-century paintings\\" and \\"Modern paintings\\". Christie's defines the term as ranging \\"from the 14th to the early 19th century\\". Anonymous artists Artists, most often from early periods, whose hand has been identified by art historians, but to whom no identity can be confidently attached, are often given names by art historians such as Master E.S. (from his monogram), Master of Fl√©malle (from a previous location of a work), Master of Mary of Burgundy (from a patron), Master of Latin 757 (from the shelf mark of a manuscript he illuminated), Master of the Brunswick Diptych or Master of Schloss Lichtenstein.

It is in the centre of the country. Its capital is Hun. Jufra was originally one of the 25 baladiya in the administrative system of Libya established in 1988. In 2001, it became a Shabiya, and its territorial extension was reduced. In 2007, under the new 22-shabiya system, its original boundaries were reintroduced. Jufra borders Sirte in the north, Al Wahat in northeast, Kufra in east, Murzuq in south, Sabha in southwest, Wadi al Shatii in west and Jabal al Gharbi in northwest. In 2012, the total population in the region was estimated at 157,747 with 150,353 Libyans. The average size of the household in the country was evaluated at 6.9, while the average household size of non-Libyans was established at 3.7. There were totally 22,713 households in the district, with 20,907 Libyan ones. The population density of the district was 1.86 persons per km2. Per 2006 census, there were totally 20,127 economically active people in the district. History and Geography The surrounding area of the three oases in the Jufra district (Sukna, Hun and Waddan) feature the majority of modern activity and traces of ancient occupation. The oases facilitate access to water and thus are natural concentrations of life. This chain of oases consist of substantial archaeology of several types and periods. The area, which was until recently under-studied is subject to the Trans-Saharan project, which in collaboration with the EAMENA work to identify (through satellite imagery analysis) and record a range of archaeological sites in the Jufra district. 86 individual sites were identified and include settlements, cairn cemeteries, field systems and foggara. These sites enable us to establish an initial chronology ranging from the first millenium BC to early modern times and develop our understanding of the occupation periods in different areas. The sites are endangered from a number of threats, most notably from construction and cultivation. Jufra is part of Fezzen geographical division of Libya and is mostly full of deserts. The region receives an annual rainfall of . There are no perennial rivers in the region, but the region is abundant with groundwater aquifers. Libya has mostly a flat undulating plain and occasional plateau, with an average elevation of around . Around 91 per cent of the land is covered by desert, with only 8.8 per cent agricultural land (with only 1% arable lands) and 0.1 per cent of forests. The major resources are petroleum, gypsum and natural gas. Dust storms lasting four to eight days is pretty common during Spring. Vast Haruj volcanic field is largest geographic features, visible from space. Demographics Per the estimates of 2012, the total population in the region was 157,747 with 150,353 Libyans.

Local administration Borders of Jufra District from 2001 until 2007, under the 32-shabiya system. Libya became independent in 1951 from the colonial empire and generally known for its oil rich resources. All the powers rested centrally with the President Gaddafi for 42 years till the 2011 armed rebellion which toppled him. As per the constitution, Libya is the most decentralized Arab nation, but practically all powers are vested on central government on account of control over the oil revenues. Local governmental institutions manage the administration of education, industry, and communities. As a part of decentralization in 2012, the country is administratively split into 13 regions from the original 25 municipalities, which were further divided in 1,500 communes. Since 2015, the chief of the state is a Chairman of Presidential Council, while the Prime Minister is the head of the state. The House of Representatives is an elected body that is elected on universal suffrage and popular vote. As of 2016, there were 22 administrative divisions in the country in the form of districts.

It is in size.\\"Avalon Peninsula\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia. The peninsula is home to 262,411 people, about 51% of Newfoundland's population, according to the 2011 Canadian Census. The peninsula is the location of St. John's, the provincial capital and largest city. It is connected to the main section of the island by the wide Isthmus of Avalon. The peninsula protrudes into the rich fishing zones near the Grand Banks. Its four major bays (Trinity Bay, Conception Bay, St. Mary's Bay and Placentia Bay) have long been the centre of Newfoundland's fishing industry. Geography and geology The coast of the Avalon Peninsula, in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador The Avalon Peninsula is itself pinched into peninsulas by St. Mary's Bay and Conception Bay. St. John's is located in the northeast of the peninsula. The Avalon Peninsula is a noted region for Precambrian fossils, and many Lagerst√§tten of the diverse Ediacaran biota are found on the peninsula. Mistaken Point is the original location of the first documented Ediacaran, Aspidella terranovica (which gets its specific name from Newfoundland). The peninsula gives its name to the ancient micro-continent Avalonia of which it was part. History In 1497, explorer John Cabot led an expedition from England in an attempt to reach the Spice Islands in the East Indies, that supposedly ended up off what is now Bonavista. The first permanent English settlement was established at Cuper's Cove in 1610. Sir George Calvert was later given a large land holding on the peninsula. The initial colony of Ferryland grew to a population of 100, becoming the first successful permanent settlement on Newfoundland island. In 1623 Calvert was given a Royal Charter extending the Royal lands and granting them the name Province of Avalon \\"in imitation of Old Avalon in Somersetshire wherein Glassenbury stands, the first fruits of Christianity in Britain as the other was in that party of America\\". Calvert wished to make the colony a refuge for Roman Catholics facing persecution in England. In 1625, Calvert was elevated to the Peerage of Ireland as The 1st Baron Baltimore. A series of crises and calamities led Lord Baltimore to quit the colony in 1629 for \\"some other warmer climate of this new world\\", which turned out to be Maryland, though his family maintained agents to govern Avalon until 1637, when the entire island of Newfoundland was granted by charter to Sir David Kirke and The 3rd Marquess of Hamilton. Quidi Vidi, a district of St. John's In 1696, during King William's War, the French destroyed many English villages in the Avalon Peninsula Campaign. During Queen Anne's War, Commodore John Leake of the Royal Navy led an expedition aimed at capturing French ships around the Peninsula and burning French settlements. The expedition was largely successful. During this same conflict, the French attempted to besiege the fortified English port of St. John's, but were unsuccessful. They later returned and captured the town, burning it to the ground. The final major battle of the French and Indian War, the Battle of Signal Hill, was fought on the Peninsula in 1762. In this engagement, British soldiers and artillery under the command of William Amherst drove the French occupants of St. John's from Signal Hill and into the town's fort, where they soon surrendered.

It focused on a group of high school students, and while it was originally gag-a-day, it evolved into a coherent, long-term story with realistic characters. The comic launched on 8 November 1999 and was originally scheduled to end in August 2002. Avalon was a member of Keenspot. Hiatus and Aftermath After a series of lengthening delays, Phillips eventually placed the comic on indefinite hiatus on 24 August 2004. No new Avalon comics were produced until 24 January 2006, when Phillips posted a new strip and stated his intention to finish the series. Only seven new strips were produced, the last of which was released on 28 February 2006. As of May 2006, no new strips have been released, and no explanation had been given. On 15 February 2007, Phillips revamped the site, linking to the text summary of the storyline's conclusion on the otherwise-blank main page. This summary described the intended endings of the story arcs introduced up to that point, including the revelation that a presumed-heterosexual character would enter a lesbian affair. After an extended period of hiatus, Phillips mentioned that he was considering farming out the art and writing to fellow webcartoonist, David Willis, so that his dedicated fan-base could achieve closure from the storyline. Phillips announced that, having recently been married, he had \\"outgrown\\" Avalon and cartooning in general, and had no further need to continue the project. He briefly tried his hand at several smaller projects, such as the short-lived webcomic \\"Two-Eighty\\", but abandoned them after only a few updates. Awards In 2001, Avalon won Web Cartoonist's Choice Awards for and . In 2002, it was nominated for and , and won . Avalon was nominated for the 2003's as well.

It is the third in Levinson's semi- autobiographical tetralogy of \\"Baltimore films\\" set in his hometown during the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s: Diner (1982), Tin Men (1987), and Liberty Heights (1999). The film explores the themes of Jewish assimilation into American life, through several generations of a Polish immigrant family from the 1910s through the 1950s. The film was released to critical acclaim, and was nominated for four Academy Awards and three Golden Globe Awards. Plot It is the late 1940s and early 1950s, and much has happened to the family of Polish Jewish immigrant Sam Krichinsky since he first arrived in America in 1914 and eventually settled in Baltimore. Television is new. Neighborhoods are changing, with more and more families moving to the suburbs. Wallpaper has been Sam's profession, but his son Jules wants to try his hand at opening a large discount-appliance store with his cousin, Izzy, maybe even do their own commercials on TV. Jules and his wife, Ann, still live with his parents, but Ann is quietly enduring the way that her opinionated mother-in-law Eva dominates the household. Ann is a modern woman who even learns to drive a car, although Eva refuses to ride with her and takes a streetcar instead. The family contributes to a fund to bring more relatives to America. Slights, real or imagined, concern the family, as when Jules and Ann finally move to the suburbs, a long way for their relatives to travel. After arriving late and finding a Thanksgiving turkey has been carved without him, Uncle Gabriel is offended and storms out, beginning a feud with Sam. Sam also cannot understand the methods his grandson Michael's teachers use in school, or why Jules and Izzy have changed their surnames to Kaye and Kirk as they launch their business careers. But when various crises develop, including an armed holdup and a devastating fire, the family members generally see them through together.

Its capital is Al Jawf, one of the oases in Kufra basin. There is a very large oil refinery near the capital. In the late 15th century, Leo Africanus reported an oasis in the land of the Berdoa, visited by a caravan coming from Awjila. It is possible that this oasis was identical with either the Al Jawf or the Taiserbo oasis, and on early modern maps, the Al Kufra region was often labelled as Berdoa based on this report. History The name Kufra (comes from Kufuh and Epher) itself is a derivation from kafir, the Arabic term for non-Muslims.Friedrich Gerhard Rohlfs, Reise von Tripolis nach der Oase Kufra (1881). Kufra did not fall under the dominion of either the Arabs or the Ottomans and was colonized by the Arab Bedouin tribe of the Zuwayya only in the mid 19th century, and eventually by the Italians by the 1930s. In 1931, during the campaign of Cyrenaica, General Rodolfo Graziani easily conquered Kufra, considered a strategic region, leading about 3,000 soldiers from infantry and artillery, supported by about twenty bombers. Geography Kufra's location in Libya's southeast places it on the country's border with Egypt, Sudan (unlike any other Libyan district), and Chad. It borders the following regions of these countries, namely, New Valley Governorate, Egypt in the east, Shamaliyah State, Sudan in southeast, North Darfur State, Sudan in the far southeast, Bourkou-Ennedi-Tibesti Region, Chad in the south. Domestically, it borders the following districts, namely, Murzuq in west, Jufra in northwest and Al Wahat in north. Kufra is a part of Cyrenacian geographical subdivision, the largest region in Libya and which is mostly semi arid in nature. The region receives an annual rainfall of . There are no perennial rivers in the region, but the region is abundant with groundwater aquifers. All three regions of the county have mostly a flat undulating plain and occasional plateau, with an average elevation of around . Around 91 per cent of the land is covered by desert, with only 8.8 per cent agricultural land (with only 1% arable lands) and 0.1 per cent of forests. It is desert climate in all other parts of the region. Dust storms lasting four to eight days are fairly common during Spring. Demographics Al Kufrah borders from 2001 to 2007 Per the census estimation of 2012, the total population in the region was 157,747 with 150,353 Libyans. The average size of the household in the country was 6.9, while the average household size of non- Libyans being 3.7. There were totally 22,713 households in the district, with 20,907 Libyan ones. The population density of the district was 1.86 persons per sq. km. Per 2006 census, there were totally 13,313 economically active people in the district. There were 6,295 government employees, 2,178 employers, 6,454 first level workers and 001 second level workers. There were 85 workers in state administration, 85 in agriculture, animal husbandry and forestry, 2,445 in agriculture and hunting, 2,029 in education, 1,558 in private enterprises, 584 in health and social work, 85 in production, 2,214 in technical work and 354 service workers. The total enrollment in schools was 17,364 and the number of people above secondary stage and less than graduation was 875. As per the report from World Health Organization (WHO), there were one communicable disease centres, one dental clinic, one general clinics, three out-patient clinics, five pharmacies, 16 PHC centres, one rural clinics and no specialized clinics. Local administration During 2007, the northern part of Kufra District was moved to the newly created Al Wahat District. Besides the main Oasis group of the Kufra basin, four more oases belong to the region, which lie northwest of Kufra basin are Rebiana, Buzema, Wadi Zighen and Tazirbu. The oasis-valleys of Jabal Arkanu and Jebel Uweinat lie southeast of the basin.Bertarelli 1929, p. 515. Libya became independent in 1951 from the colonial empire and generally known for its oil rich resources. As a part of decentralization in 2012, the country is administratively split into 13 regions from the original 25 municipalities, which were further divided in 1,500 communes. As of 2016, there were 22 administrative divisions in the country in the form of districts.

The National Map, accessed March 16, 2011 and is one of the most dynamic river systems in Southern California. The river drains parts of four ranges in the Transverse Ranges System north and northwest of Los Angeles, then flows west onto the Oxnard Plain and into the Santa Barbara Channel of the Pacific Ocean. The watershed has provided habitat for a wide array of native plants and animals and has historically supplied humans with water, fish, and fertile farmland. The northern portion of the watershed was home to the Tataviam people while the southern portion was occupied by the Chumash people. Much of the Santa Clara River Valley is used for agriculture which has limited the use of structural levees to separate the natural floodplain from the river. Although it is one of the least altered rivers in Southern California, some levees exist where the river flows through areas of significant urban development. History The Santa Clara River was originally named the Rio de Santa Clara on August 9, 1769 by the Portol√° expedition on the march north from San Diego to found a mission at Monterey, to honor Saint Clare of Assisi who died on August 11, 1253. The Santa Clara River Valley was then known as the Ca√±ada de Santa Clara. The Santa Clara- Mojave River Ranger District of the Angeles National Forest is named after the Santa Clara River. Floods The failure and near complete collapse of the St. Francis Dam took place in the middle of the night on March 12, 1928. The dam was holding a full reservoir of 12.4 billion gallons (47 billion liters) of water that surged down San Francisquito Canyon and emptied into the river. Course Aerial view of the Santa Clara River as it winds through Soledad Canyon just east of Santa Clarita Piru The Santa Clara River's headwaters take drainage from the northern slopes of the San Gabriel Mountains near the Angeles Forest Highway, inside the western part of the Angeles National Forest. Its largest fork, Aliso Canyon, is about long and forms the primary headstream. These branches combine into the broad wash of the main stem near the town of Acton which flows west through Soledad Canyon, crossing under California State Route 14 near the town of Canyon Country. The Sierra Pelona Mountains on the north provide additional watershed and seasonal tributaries. The river receives Bouquet Creek, Placerita Creek, and San Francisquito Creek within the City of Santa Clarita. The riverbed surface remains dry most of the year here, except on extreme occasions of heavier than average rainfall. The river then crosses west under Interstate 5 and receives Castaic Creek from the right. After the Castaic Creek confluence, the river starts to flow primarily southwest through the Santa Clarita Valley. Near the county line between Los Angeles County and Ventura County, the river enters the Santa Clara River Valley flowing past Buckhorn and Fillmore, incorporating additional flow from Piru Creek and Sespe Creek, both from the right, and Santa Paula Creek at the town of Santa Paula, where it passes the large South Mountain Oil Field on the south bank. The Santa Clara River then bends southwest, passing the Saticoy Oil Field on the north bank where South Mountain marks its entrance onto the broad Oxnard Plain. The river ends at the Pacific Ocean after flowing across the north side of this plain made fertile with the silt deposited by the river. A sand bar usually stands across the mouth at the Santa Clara Estuary Natural Preserve that lies within McGrath State Beach in Oxnard and bounded on the north by the city of Ventura. Watershed Although located just north of the heavily populated Los Angeles Basin, the Santa Clara River watershed remains one of the most natural on the South Coast.\\"State of the Watershed ‚Äì Report on Surface Water Quality: The Santa Clara River Watershed\\" (November 2006) RB-AR22181 California Regional Water Quality Control Board ‚Äì Los Angeles Region It is separated from the Los Angeles Basin by the low Santa Susana Mountains, along the north side of which the Santa Clara River runs. On the east are the San Gabriel Mountains, and on the north are the Santa Ynez Mountains, Sespe Mountains, San Cayetano Mountains, and Tehachapi Mountains. Piru, Castaic and Sespe Creeks, each over long, are the primary tributaries of the Santa Clara River. While Piru and Castaic Creeks form reservoirs for the California State Water Project (Pyramid Lake and Lake Piru on Piru Creek, and Elderberry Forebay and Castaic Lake on Castaic Creek), Sespe Creek is designated a National Wild and Scenic River, unique among Southern California streams. There are 57 archaeological sites and 12 historical landmarks in the watershed.\\"California Protected Areas Data Portal\\" GreenInfo Network San Francisco California The Santa Clara River watershed borders on the Ventura River/Matilija Creek watershed on the west. On the northwest lies the Santa Ynez River watershed. On the north is the interior drainage basin of Tulare Lake in the Central Valley. To the east is the Mojave River and to the south is the Los Angeles River. The Santa Clara River is the second largest river in Southern California; the larger one is the Santa Ana River. Estuary  The estuary has been modified by human activities at least since 1855. By the late 1920s roads and agricultural fields had become established. In the late 1950s the former delta area was occupied by the Ventura Water Reclamation Facility and agricultural fields with levees constraining the river from these areas and directing the flow to the Harbor Boulevard bridge.STAFF REPORT (August 2010) \\"TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOAD FOR TOXAPHENE FOR THE SANTA CLARA RIVER ESTUARY\\" CALIFORNIA REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD - LOS ANGELES REGION McGrath State Beach was established in 1948.Johnson, Brett (December 15, 2014) \\"McGrath State Beach campground, estuary issues under study\\" Ventura County Star The estuary has been designated a Natural Preserve within McGrath State Beach on the south bank of the river mouth.\\"Santa Clara River Estuary: Profile\\" (1997) California Resources Agency From the north bank of the river, the city of Ventura releases some of treated effluent daily that flows into the Santa Clara Estuary Natural Preserve from their water reclamation facility (VWRF).Clerici, Kevin (August 17, 2011) \\"Ventura reaches settlement, agrees to reuse millions of gallons of highly treated sewage water\\" Ventura County Star A sand berm separates the river from the ocean most of the year. In years with adequate rainfall, the river breaks the berm which is then slowly rebuilt by ocean action through the rest of the year. When the river watershed has an exceptionally dry year, the berm acts as a dam, allowing the water level to rise with the discharge. In August 2014, with the frequent flooding of the access road and many of the campsites in the state park, a report found that the park had only been open five of the past eighteen months because of repeated flooding.Carlson, Cheri (August 25, 2014) \\"Campground flooded, closes again\\" Ventura County Star When the berm is broken when it is not raining, fish can become stranded in the sudden draining of the estuary waters.Carlson, Cheri (February 11, 2014) \\"Sandy berm breached near McGrath State Beach campground\\" Ventura County Star The estuary was identified on the 1998, 2002 and 2006 Clean Water Act 303(d) lists of impaired water bodies. In 2012, the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board required the Counties of Ventura and Los Angeles together with cities along river to limit the total maximum daily load of bacteria potentially harmful to human health that discharges from stormwater outfalls into the Santa Clara River, primarily during the dry season. Sources of bacteria of concern in urban runoff from the County, City of Fillmore, City of Oxnard, City of Santa Clarita, City of Santa Paula, and City of Ventura include pet and animal wastes, sanitary sewer overflows, and organic debris such as leaves and grass. Examples of ways they will improve water quality include increased frequencies of street sweeping and stormwater catch basin cleaning; field surveys to locate and eliminate both dry season street runoff and leaks from the sanitary sewer systems; and enhanced public education.Administrative Report (October 27, 2014) \\"Memorandum of Agreement to Improve Water Quality in the Santa Clara River\\" City of San Buenaventura City Council Natural history The river is habitat for threatened species such as the unarmored three-spined stickleback, steelhead, southwestern pond turtle, and least Bell's vireo. In 2002, eight Southwest willow flycatchers hatched in the Hedrick Ranch Nature Area (HRNA), a preserve just east of Santa Paula managed by the Friends of Santa Clara River. The first SWFs to hatch on the river in recent times was at the Fillmore Fish Hatchery in 2000. The endemic, endangered Santa Ana sucker (Catostomus santaanae) lives in parts of the Santa Clara River system. Fisherman with catch of steelhead in lower Sespe Creek, by William A. Brown, winter, 1911 Historic documentation of an important recreational steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fishery occurs for the Santa Clara River into the mid 1900s. The steelhead trout run on the Santa Clara river prior to 1940 is estimated to have had thousands of fish and to have been one of the largest steelhead runs in southern California. Construction of the Vern Freeman Diversion Dam and other migration barriers on the mainstem, Santa Paula Creek, Sespe Creek, Piru Creek, and other tributaries during the mid 1900s appear to be correlated with the demise of the steelhead run as habitat availability decreased and surface flows decreased. Adult steelhead still try to migrate up the river with an adult trapped at the Vern Freeman Dam in 2001. A wild rainbow trout population still exists in the headwaters of the Santa Paula, Sespe, Hopper, and Piru Creek tributaries and is producing out-migrating steelhead smolts bound for the Pacific. However, challenges to outgoing smolt migration include low to no stream flows downstream of the dam or predation in the coastal estuary. Lampreys, a parasite, also impact the steelhead. Invasive species such as Arundo donax also create changes that are not favorable to spawning trout.Kallas, Anne (February 8, 2012) \\"Pair working to restore Santa Clara River\\" Ventura County Star Genetic analysis of the steelhead in the Santa Clara River watershed has shown them to be of native and not hatchery stocks. There were beaver (Castor canadensis) historically in the Santa Clara River until Europeans arrived, according to oral Venture√±o history taken by ethnolinguist John Peabody Harrington in the early twentieth century. The full reference is: \\"The beaver comes and gnaws the tree on the side towards which it leans, and at last falls over. The tree is leaning towards our house. I am beginning to fear that it will fall on us. The beaver builds its house in the river or the cienegas in the time of our ancestors. There were beavers at Ventura and also at Saticoy.\\" This historical observer record is consistent with a beaver skull collected in 1906 in the Sespe Creek tributary by Dr. John Hornung, a zoologist at the Los Angeles Museum of Natural History. Pronghorn antelope (Antilocapra americana) used to roam along the Santa Clara River, as Father Pedro Font, describe in his diary on the de Anza Expedition February 1776, \\"We saw in the plain a very large drove of antelopes which, as soon as they saw us, fled like the wind, looking like a cloud skimming along the earth.\\" Also for antelope, there is a Venture√±o word for antelope: q'aq, which is different from their separate words for deer and elk.(personal communication with Timothy Henry, January 30, 2011) Quagga mussels were discovered in Lake Piru in 2013. They are an invasive species found in rivers and lakes in the U.S.Coyne, Alasdair (January 27, 2014) \\"Quagga mussels loose in Santa Clara watershed\\" Ventura County Star River modifications=In Ventura County The Harbor Boulevard bridge, the most westerly crossing, marks the upstream boundary of McGrath State Beach and the Ventura Water Reclamation Facility while the estuary continues a little farther upstream. In 1969 the river breached the north bank, flowed through an area that had historical been part of the estuary, flooded a new golf course and Harbor Boulevard, and deposited silt and debris into recently completed Ventura Harbor just upcoast from the reclamation facility.Meyers, Jeff (November 1, 1990) \\"An Era of Sail Lies Anchored in Two Harbors : Boating: Ventura County shoreline took on greater appeal with construction of marinas in Ventura and Oxnard.\\" Los Angeles Times Over the years, many communities have used the river banks as dumps to create levees that would keep the river from flooding adjacent lands during occasional years with heavy winter rains. Three dump sites about upstream from the mouth came under the control of the Ventura Regional Sanitation District by 1988. The district used the landfill gases to produce electricity until 2001. As the landfill aged and its contents decomposed, the release of gas became intermittent and the gases from the recovery system are burned off in a flare. The defunct power plant was built just upstream of the Victoria Avenue bridge, the second crossing upstream from the ocean.McGrath, Rachel (September 4, 2014) \\"Sanitation district to pay $466,000 penalty for landfill gas violations\\" Ventura County Star The riverbed was mined extensively for sand and gravel throughout the post‚ÄìWorld War II building boom for the construction of homes and highways. Mining the riverbed for sand and gravel impacts the riparian zones by destroying habitat and changes sediment flow regimes. The mining decreased significantly in the 1990s due to increased costs needed to satisfy environmental concerns and concerns that the removal of material increased scouring and undermining of bridge foundations and pipelines that crossed the river.McCartney, Patrick (August 31, 1993) \\"Gravel Producer Drops Plans for Mining River : Environment: Granite Construction decides that regulations would make it too costly to extract rocks and sand from the Santa Clara.\\" Los Angeles Times there were still 3 active gravel operations in the upstream area. There are also water diversions, most notably the Freeman Diversion Dam, located approximately from the ocean The United Water Conservation District, formed in 1950, battles groundwater overdraft through a combination of aquifer recharge and providing alternative surface water supplies. The District owns Lake Piru and key facilities along the Santa Clara River that are used to manage groundwater supplies.Wenner, Gretchen (December 31, 2011) \\"Brackish plant on Oxnard Plain could clean salty water\\" Ventura County Star The district provides wholesale water delivery through three pipelines to various portions of the Oxnard Plain. The Vern Freeman Diversion Dam, built by United Water in 1991 on the Santa Clara river, channels water to shallow basins designed to replenish the aquifer. For decades before the structure was built, earthen dams were constructed in the river to divert water to farmers and replenished the aquifer. The berms would have to be rebuilt whenever winter rains created a flow that breached the berms.Barlow, Zeke (May 26, 2011) \\"Little known Freeman Diversion shaped Ventura County\\" Ventura County Star Southern California Steelhead were declared endangered in 1997 and the fish ladder on the structure was deemed insufficient. The National Marine Fisheries Service determined in 2015 that fixing this was a high priority since it is the first structure the steelhead encounter when attempting to migrate from the ocean.Wenner, Gretchen (January 23, 2015) \\"$60 million cost for fish passage has district reeling\\" Ventura County Star A judge determined in 2018 that the federal Endangered Species Act had been violated by United Water by failing to ensure that the structure provided an adequate water supply and migratory passageway for steelhead.

The First Amendment to the United States Constitution states that \\"Congress shall make no law ... abridging ... the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\\" The existence of free speech zones is based on U.S. court decisions stipulating that the government may reasonably regulate the time, place, and manner ‚Äì but not content ‚Äì of expression. The Supreme Court has developed a four-part analysis to evaluate the constitutionality of time, place and manner (TPM) restrictions. To pass muster under the First Amendment, TPM restrictions must be neutral with respect to content, be narrowly drawn, serve a significant government interest, and leave open alternative channels of communication. Application of this four-part analysis varies with the circumstances of each case, and typically requires lower standards for the restriction of obscenity and fighting words. Free speech zones have been used at a variety of political gatherings. The stated purpose of free speech zones is to protect the safety of those attending the political gathering, or for the safety of the protesters themselves.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has filed, with various degrees of success and failure, a number of lawsuits on the issue.

On college and university campuses The use of free speech zones on university campuses is controversial. Many universities created on-campus free speech zones during the 1960s and 1970s, during which protests on-campus (especially against the Vietnam War) were common. Generally, the requirements are that the university is given advance notice and that they are held in locations that do not disrupt classes. In 1968, the Supreme Court ruled in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District that non-disruptive speech is permitted in public schools. However, this does not apply to private universities.

Earl of Lovelace was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1838 for William King-Noel, 8th Baron King, a title created in 1725. History The King or Locke King family stems from the elevation of the son of Jerome King, a grocer, of Exeter, and his wife Anne, great-niece of the philosopher John Locke. This son was Sir Peter King, a prominent lawyer and politician who served as Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas from 1714 to 1725 and as Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain from 1725 to 1733; as such in 1725 he was created Baron King of Ockham in the County of Surrey, in the Peerage of Great Britain (verbally and less formally Lord King). The estate he bought was chosen as his territorial designation. He was succeeded by his eldest son (the second Baron). He represented Launceston and Exeter in the House of Commons but died aged 34. His three younger brothers: Peter, William and Thomas all succeeded in the barony. The last was succeeded by his son, the sixth Baron. His son, the seventh Baron, was a Whig politician and writer. On his 1833 death the title passed to his eldest son, the eighth Baron. In 1835, Lord King married as his first wife the Hon. (Augusta) Ada Byron, the only daughter of the poet, Lord Byron, and his wife, 11th Baroness Wentworth who was a descendant of the extinct Barons Lovelace. In 1838 he was created Viscount Ockham (territorial designation the same, to be the family's first courtesy title), and Earl of Lovelace in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was appointed the Lord-Lieutenant of Surrey from 1840 to 1893. Ada died in 1852, leaving her husband, in his forties, a widower. In 1860, he assumed for himself the additional surname and arms of Noel, those of Wentworth. In 1865 he remarried, to Jane Crawford Jenkins and had one child, who would go on eventually to inherit the earldom. Lord Lovelace acquired Horsley Towers (now a hotel) in East Horsley and was patron of the parish church funding the rebuilding of the chancel and the nave in 1869.St Martin's Church He also rebuilt the wall of the churchyard which included a number of architectural features such as the gazebo and its family crest-engraved walls. He planned for his death 20 years before he died when began work on his mausoleum in another corner of the churchyard. The mausoleum, which has recently been restored, contains his tomb and that of his second wife.Exploring Surrey's Past His eldest son Byron (King) Noel, Viscount Ockham, briefly succeeded his maternal grandmother to become twelfth Baron Wentworth according to its special remainder in 1860. However, he predeceased his father, unmarried two years later. Lord Lovelace was therefore succeeded by his second surviving son who was thus already Lord Wentworth. In 1861, this still untitled son had assumed by Royal licence the surname of Milbanke in lieu of Noel. He had no sons and was succeeded in the barony of Wentworth by his only child, Ada King- Milbanke, 14th Baroness Wentworth. The 2nd Earl (Lord Lovelace) was succeeded in the titles other than the Wentworth one by his half-brother. In 1895, Lord Lovelace received for himself only Royal licence to use the additional surname and arms of Noel, but resumed by Royal licence, in 1908, the surname and arms of King only for himself and his children. He served in the First World War as a Major in the Northumberland Fusiliers and as a staff-Captain. The titles were finally held by his grandson, the fifth Earl, who succeeded his father in 1964. The last Earl inherited the title in 1964 and died in 2018.Earl of Lovelace dies at Highland home, aged 66 The family seat following its purchase by the 1st Lord King was Ockham Park, Ockham, Surrey until the fine Jacobean house was reduced to outbuildings in a fire in 1948. The family has moved its main home to Torridon House, near Torridon in Ross-shire. Notable wives Ada Lovelace was an English mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine. Because of this, she is often described as the world's first computer programmer.. Notable younger sons and their sons The Hon. Peter King, second son of the seventh Lord King (and brother of the first Earl of Lovelace), was a long-serving progressive politician who bought Brooklands and the father of Hugh F. Locke King, the entrepreneur who transformed it into a pioneering racetrack and aviation centre from the year 1906 onwards. The family had no male heirs. Hugh died without children in 1926 and his elder brother Peter died in middle age in 1885 in Aston without sons.

Founded by harpsichordist Christopher Hogwood in 1973, it was named after a previous organisation of the same name of the 18th century. The musicians play on either original instruments or modern copies of instruments from the period of time the music was composed. They generally play Baroque and Classical music, though they have also played some new compositions for baroque orchestra in recent years. The AAM's current Music Director is Richard Egarr. Original organisation Maurice Greene, one of the original members of the 18th-century society The original Academy of Vocal Music was founded in London, England in 1726 for the purpose of studying and performing \\"old\\" music -- defined initially as anything composed at least a century earlier. Around 1730/1 it was renamed the Academy of Ancient Music, and continued to grow in membership, including the composers William Croft, Michael Christian Festing, Maurice Greene, Bernard Gates, Giovanni Bononcini, Senesino, Nicola Haym, Francesco Geminiani, Pier Francesco Tosi, John Ernest Galliard, Charles Dieupart, Jean-Baptiste Loeillet and Giuseppe Riva. George Frideric Handel was never a member, although the society studied and performed his music as well as their own, and that of other composers of the day. Directors of the organization included Johann Christoph Pepusch (from 1735 onwards), Benjamin Cooke and Samuel Arnold (from 1789 onwards). Modern revival Christopher Hogwood, who revived AAM in 1973 In 1973, the Academy of Ancient Music was revived by the British conductor and harpsichordist, Christopher Hogwood, for the purpose of playing 18th- and early 19th-century music on period instruments. For choral works, it is joined either by the Academy of Ancient Music Chorus or by a cathedral or collegiate choir with boys' voices. In 1996, the AAM appointed Paul Goodwin as Associate Conductor and Andrew Manze as Associate Director under Christopher Hogwood. In 2003 Andrew Manze resigned as Associate director, to be replaced in 2005 by Richard Egarr. On September 1, 2006, Richard Egarr succeeded Hogwood as Music Director of the AAM and Hogwood received the title of Emeritus Director. Egarr is scheduled to conclude his tenure as AAM music director at the close of the 2020-2021 season. The AAM was the first orchestra to record all of Mozart's symphonies on period instruments. The AAM has since recorded the complete piano concertos and symphonies of Beethoven, and has recorded numerous Haydn symphonies and many of the Mozart piano concertos with fortepianist Robert Levin. The AAM has also recorded Purcell's Dido and Aeneas, Handel's Orlando and Rinaldo, Mozart's La clemenza di Tito, Haydn's L'anima del filosofo and over 200 other recordings for a range of different labels. The commissioning of new works under Paul Goodwin represented a new development for the AAM. The first commission and recording, John Tavener's Eternity's Sunrise, met with enthusiastic critical acclaim and led to a second new Tavener work and recording, Total Eclipse. David Bedford's Like a Strand of Scarlet followed in 2001 and, in 2003, the AAM premiered John Woolrich's Arcangelo, written to mark the 350th anniversary of the birth of Arcangelo Corelli. The next commission in 2006 celebrated the 250th anniversary of Mozart's birth with a work from the Scottish-American composer Thea Musgrave, Journey into Light, which was written as a companion piece to Mozart's Exsultate, jubilate. Recently, this trend has been revived with commissioning the harpsichordist, conductor, and scholar Mahan Esfahani to write a new orchestration of Bach's The Art of Fugue, which was premiered at the BBC Proms in July 2012. Both Tavener recordings are on Harmonia Mundi (France), for whom the AAM has made a large number of CDs: Mozart's Za√Øde and Christmas music by Sch√ºtz and his contemporaries (conducted by Paul Goodwin); violin concertos by J.S. Bach and Vivaldi; and concerti grossi by Handel and Geminiani (directed by Andrew Manze); and Bach's harpsichord concertos (played by Richard Egarr). Choral recordings include works by Bach, Handel, Purcell and Vivaldi, with King's College Choir under Stephen Cleobury, and several recordings with Edward Higginbottom and New College Choir, including Pergolesi's Marian Vespers and Handel's coronation anthems, a collection of music from 17th and 18th-century English coronations. With Richard Egarr, the orchestra has released Handel‚Äôs instrumental music Opp. 1‚Äì7, as well as Bach's four orchestral suites and his St John Passion. In 2013, the Academy launched an in-house label for its future recordings. The AAM is Orchestra-in-Residence at the University of Cambridge. In January 2020, the Teatro San Cassiano announced that the AAM is to become its first associate ensemble. The current chief executive of the AAM is Alexander Van Ingen, scheduled to stand down from the post in 2020. In June 2020, the AAM announced the appointment of John McMunn as its next chief executive, effective 1 September 2020.

The people spoke Muysccubun, a language of the Chibchan language family, also called Muysca and Mosca.

Subgroupings of the Muisca were mostly identified by their allegiances to three great rulers: the zaque, centered in Hunza, ruling a territory roughly covering modern southern and northeastern Boyac√° and southern Santander; the zipa, centered in Bacat√° and encompassing most of modern Cundinamarca, the western Llanos; and the iraca, religious ruler of Suamox and modern northeastern Boyac√° and southwestern Santander. The territory of the Muisca spanned an area of around from the north of Boyac√° to the Sumapaz P√°ramo and from the summits to the western portion of the Eastern Ranges. Their territory bordered the lands of the Panche in the west, the Muzo in the northwest, the Guane in the north, the Lache in the northeast, the Achagua in the east, and the Sutagao in the south. At the time of the Spaniard invasion, the area had a large population, although the precise number of inhabitants is not known. Estimates vary from half a million to up to three million inhabitants. Their economy was based on agriculture, salt mining, trading, metalworking, and manufacturing. In modern times, the population of the Muisca has drastically decreased, although in the municipalities and districts Cota, Ch√≠a, Tenjo, Suba, Engativ√°, Tocancip√°, Gachancip√°, and Ubat√©, descendants of the Muisca are present.Wiesner Garc√≠a, 1987 A census by the Ministry of Interior Affairs in 2005 provided a total of 14,051 Muisca people in Colombia. Important contributors to the knowledge about the Muisca have been their main conquistador, Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada; Spanish poet, soldier, and priest Juan de Castellanos (16th century); bishop Lucas Fern√°ndez de Piedrahita and franciscan Pedro Sim√≥n (17th century); and Javier Ocampo L√≥pez and Gonzalo Correal Urrego (recent).  History of the Muisca  Petroglyphs of El Abra (~11,000 BCE) A Muiscan ceramic figure. Knowledge of events up until 1450 is mainly derived from mythological contexts, but thanks to the Chronicles of the West Indies we do have descriptions of the final period of Muisca history, prior to Spanish arrival.  Background  Excavations in the Altiplano Cundiboyacense (the highlands of Cundinamarca and Boyac√° departments) show evidence of human activity since the Archaic stage at the beginning of the Holocene era. Colombia has one of the most ancient archaeological sites of the Americas: El Abra, which is estimated to be approximately 13,000 years old. Other archaeological traces in the region of the Altiplano Cundiboyacense have led scholars to talk about an El Abra Culture: In Tibit√≥, tools and other lithic artifacts date to 9740 BCE; on the Bogot√° savanna, especially at Tequendama Falls, other lithic tools dated a millennium later were found that belonged to specialized hunters. Human skeletons were found that date to 5000 BCE. Analysis demonstrated that the people were members of the El Abra Culture.  Muisca era  Scholars agree that the group identified as Muisca migrated to the Altiplano Cundiboyacense in the Formative era (between 500 and 1000 BCE), as shown by evidence found at Aguazuque and Soacha. Like the other formative-era cultures of America, the Muiscas were transitioning between being hunter-gatherers and becoming sedentary farmers. Around 1500 BCE, groups of agrarians with ceramic traditions came to the region from the lowlands. They had permanent housing and stationary camps, and worked the salty water to extract salt. In Zipac√≥n there is evidence of agriculture and ceramics. The oldest settlement of the highlands dates to 1270 BCE. Between 500 BCE and 800 BCE, a second wave of migrants came to the highlands. Their presence is identified by multicolor ceramics, housing, and farms. These groups were still in residence upon the arrival of the Spanish conquerors. They left abundant traces of their occupation that have been studied since the 16th century, and allow scientists to reconstruct their way of life. It is possible that the Muisca integrated with more ancient inhabitants, but the Muisca were the ones who molded the cultural profile and the social and political organization. Their language, a dialect of Chibcha, was very similar to those peoples of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta (Kogui, Ijka, Wiwa, and Kankuamo) and the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy (U'wa). = Wars = Zipa Saguamanchica (ruled 1470 to 1490) was in a constant war against aggressive tribes such as the Sutagao, and especially the Panche, who would also make difficulties for his successors, Nemequene and Tisquesusa. The Caribs were also a permanent threat as rivals of the zaque of Hunza, especially for the possession of the salt mines of Zipaquir√°, Nemoc√≥n and Tausa.  Timeline of inhabitation of the Muisca area = Political and administrative organization  Territory of the Muisca Confederation: Zaque territory in yellow Zipa territory in green The Muisca people were organized in a confederation that was a loose union of states that each retained sovereignty. The confederation was not a kingdom, as there was no absolute monarch, nor was it an empire, because it did not dominate other ethnic groups or peoples. It is hard to compare the Muisca Confederation with other American civilizations, such as the Aztec or the Inca empires. The Muisca Confederation was one of the biggest and best-organized confederations of tribes on the South American continent. Muisca culture ‚Äì Historia Universal ‚Äì accessed 20-04-2016 Every tribe within the confederation was ruled by a chief or a cacique. Most of the tribes were part of the Muisca ethnic group, sharing the same language and culture and forming relations through trade. They united in the face of a common enemy. The army was the responsibility of the zipa or zaque. The army was made up of the g√ºeches, the traditional ancient warriors of the Muisca. The Muisca Confederation existed as the union of two lesser confederations. The southern confederation, headed by the zipa, had its capital at Bacat√° (now Bogot√°). This southern polity included the majority of the Muisca population and held greater economic power. The northern territory was ruled by the zaque, and had its capital in Hunza, known today as Tunja. Although both areas had common political relations and affinities and belonged to the same tribal nation, there were still rivalries between them. Among the territories there were four chiefdoms: Bacat√°, Hunza, Duitama, and Sogamoso. The chiefdom was composed by localities. The place of religion in the Muisca social organization ‚Äì Museo del Oro ‚Äì Biblioteca Lu√≠s √Ångel Arango The tribes were divided into Capitan√≠as (ruled by a capitan). There were two kinds: Great Capitania (sybyn) and Minor Capitania (uta). The status of Capitan was inherited by maternal lineage. :Confederation (zipa or zaque) ::--> Priests (Iraca) :::--> Chiefdoms (Cacique) ::::--> Capitan√≠a (Capitan) :::::--> Sybyn ::::::--> Uta * Territories of the zipa: # Bacat√° rule: Teusaquillo, Tenjo, Subachoque, Facatativ√°, Tabio, Cota, Ch√≠a, Engativ√°, Usme, Zipaquir√°, Nemoc√≥n and Zipac√≥n # Fusagasug√° District: Fusagasug√°, Pasca and Tibacuy # Ubat√© District: Ubat√©, Cucunub√°, Simijaca, Susa # Guatavita District: Gachet√°, Guatavita and Suesca, Chocont√°, Teusac√°, Sesquil√©, Guasca, Sop√≥, Usaqu√©n, Tuna, Suba * Territories of the zaque: ** Hunza rule: Sorac√°, Ramiriqu√≠, Samac√°, Machet√°, Tenza, Tibirit√°, Lenguazaque and Turmequ√© * Territory of Tundama: Cerinza, Oicat√°, Onzaga, Sativanorte, Sativasur, Soat√°, Paipa, Tobasia * Territory of Sugamuxi: Busbanz√°, Toca, Pesca, Pisba, T√≥paga * Autonomous chiefdoms: Charal√°, Chipat√°, Tinjac√°, Saboy√°, Tacasquir√° The Muisca legislation was consuetudinary, that is to say, their rule of law was determined by long-extant customs with the approval of the zipa or zaque. This kind of legislation was suitable to a confederation system, and it was a well- organized one. The natural resources could not be privatized: woods, lakes, plateaus, rivers and other natural resources were common goods.  Language  Acosta, Von Humboldt and Zerda Chibcha, also known as muysca, mosca, or muysca cubun, belongs to the Chibchan languages. It was spoken across several regions of Central America and the north of South America. The Tairona culture and the U'wa, related to the Muisca culture, speak similar languages, which encouraged trade. The Muisca used a form of hieroglyphs for numbers. Many Chibcha words were absorbed or \\"loaned\\" into Colombian Spanish: * Geography: Many names of localities and regions were kept. In some cases, the Spanish named cities with a combination of Chibcha and Spanish words, such as Santa Fe de Bogot√° (Chibcha: \\"Bacat√°\\"). Most of the municipalities of the Boyac√° and Cundinamarca departments are derived from Chibcha names: Chocont√°, Sogamoso, Zipaquir√°, and many others. * Fruits, such as curuba and uchuva. * Relations: the youngest child is called cuba, or china for a girl; muysca means people.  Economy  Emerald from Muzo Golden breastplate The Muisca had an economy and society considered to have been one of the most powerful of the American Post-Classic stage, mainly because of the precious resources of the area: gold and emeralds. When the Spaniards arrived in Muisca territory, they found a rich statem, with the Muisca Confederation controlling mining of the following products: * emeralds: Colombia is the primary producer of emeralds in the world * copper * coal: the coal mines still operate today at Zipaquir√° and other sites. Colombia has some of the world's most significant coal reserves. Ministerio de Minas y Energia ‚Äì Proexport Colombia * salt: there were mines in production at Nemoc√≥n, Zipaquir√°, and Tausa * gold: gold was imported from other regions, but it was so abundant that it became a preferred material for Muisca handicrafts. The many handicraft works in gold and the zipa tradition of offering gold to the goddess Guatavita contributed to the legend of El Dorado. The Muisca traded their goods at local and regional markets with a system of barter. Items traded ranged from those of basic necessity through to luxury goods. The abundance of salt, emeralds, and coal brought these commodities to de facto currency status. Having developed an agrarian society, the people used terrace farming and irrigation in the highlands. Main products were fruits, coca, quinoa, yuca and potatoes. Another major economic activity was weaving. The people made a wide variety of complex textiles. The scholar Paul Bahn said: \\"the Andean cultures mastered almost every method of textile weaving or decoration now known, and their products were often finer than those of today.\\"P.

Their political and administrative organization enabled them to form a compact cultural unity with great discipline. The contributions of the Muisca culture to the national Colombian identity have been many.  Heraldry  Pre-Columbian Muisca patterns appear in various seals of modern municipalities located on the Altiplano Cundiboyacense, for instance Sop√≥ and Guatavita, Cundinamarca. Official website Sop√≥ ‚Äì accessed 05-05-2016 Official website Guatavita ‚Äì accessed 05-05-2016 The remaining Muisca people in central Colombia also have their own seal.Seal of the Muisca people ‚Äì Commons  Sports  The Muisca culture had certain sports which were part of their rituals. The turmequ√© game, also known as tejo, has survived and became a popular sport of Colombia. Also important were matches of wrestling. The winner received a finely woven cotton blanket from the chief and was qualified as a guecha warrior.  Religion  Muisca priests were educated from childhood and led the main religious ceremonies. Only the priests could enter the temples. Besides the religious activities, the priests had much influence in the lives of the people, giving counsel in matters of farming or war. The religion originally included human sacrifice, but the practice may have been extinct by the time of the Spanish conquest, as there are no first-hand Spanish accounts. Oral tradition suggests that every family gave up a child for sacrifice, that the children were regarded as sacred and cared for until the age of 15, when their lives were then offered to the Sun-god, Su√©. = Deities = * Su√©, Su√°, Zuh√© or Xu√© (The Sun god): he is the father of the Muisca. His temple was in Suamox, the sacred city of the Sun. He was the most venerated god, especially by the Confederation of the zaque, who was considered his descendant. * Ch√≠a (The Moon-goddess): her temple was in what is today the municipality of Ch√≠a. She was widely worshipped by the Confederation of the zipa, who was considered her son. * Bochica: though not properly a god, he enjoyed the same status as one. He was a chief or hero eternized in the oral tradition. The land was flooded by Huitaca, a beautiful and mean woman, or by Chibchacum, protector of the farmers. Bochica listened to the complaints of the Muisca about floods. With his stick, he broke two rocks at the edge of the Tequendama Falls and all the water came out, forming a waterfall. Bochica punished Huitaca and Chibchacum: He made Huitaca an owl and made her hold up the sky. Chibchacum was tasked with holding up the Earth. * Bachu√©: the mother of the Muisca people. It was said that a beautiful woman with a baby came out of Lake Iguaque. Bachu√© sat down at the bank of the lake and waited for the child to grow up. When he was old enough, they married and had many children, who were the Muisca. Bachu√© taught them to hunt, to farm, to respect the laws, and to worship the gods. Bachu√© was so good and loved that the Muisca referred to her as Furachoque (Good woman in Chibcha). When they became old, Bachu√© and her husband decided to go back to the deep of the lagoon. That day the Muisca were so sad, but at the same time very happy because they knew their mother was very happy. Other versions of the legend say that after stepping into the lagoon of Iguaque, Bachu√© ascended to the sky and became Ch√≠a; in other versions Chia and Bachu√© are two different figures. = Astronomy = The cult of the Muisca centered on two main deities; Su√© for the Sun and Ch√≠a for the Moon. They developed a vigesimal (based on 20) calendar and knew exactly the timing of the summer solstice (June 21), which they considered the Day of Su√©, the Sun god. The Su√© temple was in Sogamoso, the sacred city of the Sun and the seat of the Iraca (priest). The Muisca name of the city, Suamox or Sugamuxi, means \\"City of the Sun\\". On the solstice, the zaque went to Suamox for a major festival where ritual offerings were made. It was the only day of the year when the zaque showed his face, as he was considered a descendant of the Sun god.Ocampo L√≥pez, 2013, Ch.13, p.80  Mythology  The Muisca mythology is well documented. Many of the writers who contributed to the Chronicles of the West Indies were based in Bogot√°. They recorded many of the myths as they were interested in the traditions and culture of the conquered people. The Muisca territory became the seat of the colonial administration for the New Kingdom of Granada (Spanish: Nuevo Reino de Granada).  El Dorado  The origin of the legend of El Dorado (Spanish for \\"The Golden One\\") in the early 16th century may be located in the Muisca Confederation. The zipa offered gold and other treasures to the Guatavita goddess. To do so, the zipa covered himself with gold dust and washed it off in the lake while tossing gold trinkets into the waters. This tradition was well known outside the Confederation, as far as the Caribbean Sea; the Spaniards were attracted by stories of a \\"city of gold\\" that did not exist. Indigenous people sometimes got rid of the avaricious Spaniards in that way, pointing them in the direction of other peoples. Lake Guatavita was explored by conquistadors who were looking for gold offerings from the zipa to the goddess. The legend grew until the term became a metaphor for any place where great wealth may be found or made.  Architecture  The Muisca did not construct large stone structures. They didn't use the abundant rock to leave monumental ruins as has happened with other American cultures. Their houses were built with materials such as clay, canes, and wood. The houses had a conical form, most of them to the point that Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada, founder of Bogot√°, gave the area the name Valle de los Alc√°zares (\\"Valley of the Palaces\\"). The houses had small doors and windows, and the dwellings of the higher rank citizens were different. The Muisca used little furniture as they would typically sit on the floor. Tisquesusa, zipa when the Spanish arrived The zipa was richly ornamented in gold and expensive cloth Aquiminzaque, the last zaque, executed by the Spanish  The Spanish conquest  Rivalries between the zaque and the zipa were taken advantage of by the Spaniards as they conquered the heart of what would be Colombia. Some of them, such as Sebasti√°n de Belalc√°zar, Gonzalo Jim√©nez de Quesada, and Nicol√°s de Federman, interested in locating El Dorado, discovered the rich plains of Cundinamarca and Boyac√°. The presence of the Spaniards gave hope to both sovereigns that, were they to prevail in a war against the Spaniards, could make one Confederation. But the Spaniards prevailed. The Spanish executed the last Muisca sovereigns; Sagipa and Aquiminzaque in 1539 and 1540 respectively. The reaction of the chief leaders and the people did little to change the destiny of the Confederations. In 1542 Gonzalo Su√°rez Rend√≥n finally put down the last resistance and the territories of the Confederations were shared by Belalcazar, Federmann, and De Quesada. Later the Spanish Crown would elect De Quesada as the man in charge, with the title adelantado de los cabildos de Santa Fe y Tunja.  Last Muisca sovereigns  * Zipas of Bacat√°: ** Meicuchuca (1450‚Äì1470) ** Saguamanchica (1470‚Äì1490) ** Nemequene (1490‚Äì1514) ** Tisquesusa (1514‚Äì1537) ** Sagipa (1537‚Äì1539) * Zaques of Hunza: ** Hunzah√∫a (?-1470) ** Michu√° (1470‚Äì1490) ** Quemuenchatocha (1490‚Äì1537) ** Aquiminzaque (1537‚Äì1540)  Under the colonial regime  Map of Nuevo Reino de Granada (1625) When the Muisca structure disappeared under the Spanish Conquest, the territory of the Confederations of the zaque and zipa were included in a new political division within the Spanish colonies in America. The territory of the Muisca, located in a fertile plain of the Colombian Andes that contributed to make one of the most advanced South American civilizations, became part of the colonial region named Nuevo Reino de Granada. The priests and nobility of the Muisca were eliminated. Only the Capitanias remained. Much information about the Muisca culture was gathered by the Spanish administration and by authors such as Pedro de Aguado and Lucas Fern√°ndez de Piedrahita. The Spaniards created indigenous areas to keep the survivors, who were obligated to work the land for them in what were called encomiendas. The colonial era contributed to the importance of Bogot√°, and people from the area would play an important role in the fights for independence and republican consolidation. The wars of independence of three nations (Colombia with Panam√°, Venezuela, and Ecuador) were led by the descendants of the conquerors. Aboriginal, African, and mixed race people were soldiers, no less important a role.  Independent Colombia  Muisca people (1882) = 20th century = After independence in 1810, the new state dissolved many of the indigenous reservations. The one in Tocancip√° was dissolved in 1940.Decree of August 14, 1940, Republic of Colombia. The one in Sesquil√© was reduced to 10% of its original size. Tenjo was reduced to 54% of its original size after 1934. The Reservation of Cota was re-established on land bought by the community in 1916, and then recognized by the 1991 constitution; the recognition was withdrawn in 1998 by the state and restored in 2006. In 1948 the state forbade the production of chicha, a corn-based alcoholic drink.Law 34 of 1948, Republic of Colombia. This was a blow to the culture and economy of the Muisca. The ban remained until 1991. Since then, the \\"Festival of the chicha, maize, life, and joy\\" is celebrated every year in Barrio La Perseverancia, a neighborhood in Bogot√° where most of the chicha is produced. = 21st century = Wikibooks Rediscovery of the Muisca indigenous heritage 17px El redescubrimiento de la tradici√≥n ind√≠gena Since 1989 there has been a process of reconstruction of the indigenous councils by the surviving members of the Muisca Culture. Muisca Councils currently working are Suba, Bosa, Cota, Ch√≠a, and Sesquil√©. The councils had an Assembly in Bosa on 20‚Äì22 September 2002, called the First General Congress of the Muisca People. In that congress, they founded the Cabildo Mayor del Pueblo Muisca, affiliated to the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia (ONIC).Abbreviation in Spanish: \\"Organizaci√≥n Nacional Ind√≠gena de Colombia\\" They proposed linguistic and cultural recuperation, defense of the territories nowadays occupied by others, and proposed urban and tourist plans. They support the communities of Ubat√©, Tocancip√°, Soacha, R√°quira, and Tenjo in their efforts to recover their organizational and human rights. The Muisca people of Suba opposed the drying up of the Tibabuyes wetland and wanted to recover the Juan Amarillo wetland. They defended the natural reserves like La Conejera, part of the Suba Hills that is considered by the Shelter's Council to be communal land. Suati Magazine (The Song of the Sun) is a publication of poetry, literature, and essays about Muisca culture. The community of Bosa made important achievements in its project of natural medicine in association with the Paul VI Hospital and the District Secretary of Health of Bogot√°. The community of Cota has reintroduced the growing of quinua, and regularly barter their products at market. Toward the end of 2006 there was a report on the Muisca population: * 3 Muisca councils: Cota, Ch√≠a, and Sesquil√©, with a population of 2,318 persons * in the Capital District 5,186 people are registered as belonging to the Musica ethnic group * in the localities of Suba and Bosa, 1,573 people are registered * the report does not include the number of people of the Muisca ethnic group in the entire territory of the ancient Muisca Confederation or outside that territory. It does not include Muisca Creole persons, it is to say, those of mixed Muisca ancestry.  Muisca research  Studies of Muisca culture are abundant and have a long tradition. The first sources come from the Chronicles of the West Indies, which work lasted for three centuries during the existence of the colonial New Kingdom of Granada. After the independence wars in 1810, there was a surge of interest in the study of the Muisca culture. White Colombians established the capital of their republic in Bogot√°, the former viceroyal city, which was the capital of the confederation of the zipa, and was known as Bacat√°. Research shows that this site was the cradle of an advanced society whose process of consolidation was cut short by the Spanish conquest.Arg√ºello G., Pedro Mar√≠a; History of the Investigation of the Rock Art in Colombia This search for an identity resulted in giving emphasis to the Muisca culture and overlooking other native nations, which were seen as wild people. Researchers wrongly concluded that the Muisca culture inhabited a previously empty land and that all archeological finds could be attributed solely to the Muisca. In 1849 president Tom√°s Cipriano de Mosquera invited Italian cartographer Agust√≠n Codazzi, who led the Geography Commission with Manuel Anc√≠zar and did descriptive studies of the national territory and an inventory of the archaeological sites. The result of the expedition was published in Bogot√° in 1889 as Peregrinaci√≥n Alfa.Anc√≠zar, Manuel; Peregrinaci√≥n Alfa (Alpha Travels), Bogot√°, 1889: Comisi√≥n Coreogr√°fica Agust√≠n Codazzi Arg√ºello Garc√≠a pointed out that the goal of that expedition in the context of the new nation was to underline the pre-Hispanic societies and in that sense, they centered on the Muisca culture as the main model. A similar tendency can be found in the works of Ezequiel Uricoechea.Uricoechea, Ezequiel; Memorias sobre las Antig√ºedades Neogranadinas (Memoirs of the Ancient Neogranadian Cultures), Berl√≠n, 1854 An objection to that point of view came from Vicente Restrepo: his work Los chibchas antes de la conquista espa√±olaRestrepo, Vicente; Los chibchas antes de la conquista espa√±ola (The Chibcha people before the Spanish Conquest), 1895 showed them as barbarians. Miguel Triana, in his work La Civilizaci√≥n ChibchaTriana, Miguel; La Civilizaci√≥n Chibcha (The Chibcha Civilization), 1924 suggested that the rock art symbols were writing. Wenceslao Cabrera Ort√≠z was the one who concluded that the Muisca were migrants to the highlands; in 1969 he published on thisOrt√≠z, Wenceslao Cabrera; Monumentos rupestres de Colombia (Colombian Rock-art Monuments) in Cuaderno primero: Generalidades, Algunos conjuntos pict√≥ricos de Cundinamarca, 1969 and reported about excavations at the El Abra archaeological site. Those publications opened a new era in the studies of the pre-Hispanic cultures in Colombia. Recent archaeological work has also concentrated on the creation and composition of Muisca goldwork, with this data being made available for wider research.  Named after the Muisca and their culture  Several (fossil) flora and fauna found in Colombia in the area of the Muisca have been named after the people. Two volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io have been named after the Muisca religion and mythology.

With a population of about 881,000, it is the third-largest city in Libya, after Tripoli and Benghazi. It is the capital city of the Misrata District and has been called the trade capital of Libya. The harbor is at Qasr Ahmad. Etymology The name \\"Misrata\\" derives from the Misrata tribe, a section of the larger Berber Hawwara confederacy, whose homeland in Antiquity and the early Islamic period was coastal Tripolitania.Deadly fighting rages in Libya's Bani Walid . Al Jazeera English. 2012-10-23. \\"Trirone Acrone\\", the oldest description mentioned by Ptolemy III Euergetes of Misrata because it consists of three heads of land stretching into the sea depth, and got Misrata importance by being at the crossroads of many convoys and also because it is in the middle of an agricultural area with the name of \\"Cephalae Promentorium\\" (Kevalay) of the Greek geographer Strabo. And the city of Misrata is one of the commercial stations that have been built by the Phoenicians, since more than 3000 years (The Tenth Century BC) to the north-western parts of the Libyan coast. The flag then by the name of Thubactis Misrata and know that name in relation to the Berber tribe of Misurata (The Misurateens), which means the sailors. History The main mosque at Misrata Early history Modern Misrata was established around the 7th century AD during the beginning of modern Libya's rule by the Caliphate. Some contemporary sources claim the town existed prior to Islamic rule, during the Roman Empire era and that its initial Arabic name derived from its Roman name Thubactis. David Mattingly, author of Tripolitania, a comprehensive reference book on northwestern Libya, stated that identification of Misrata as the ancient Thubactis is particularly problematic, complicated and \\"defies an easy answer.\\" Nonetheless the Roman town was located at some point on the oasis upon which the modern city sits. The two common identifications are at the eastern and western anchorages of modern Misrata or south and inland of the city, respectively. The Roman town was recorded as one of the six municipia (small self-governing cities) of the Tripolitania province, a rank below coloniae (cities with full citizenship rights.) In any case, in the 7th century, it served as a caravan supply center and an important port. Merchant traders from Misrata were well known throughout the Sahara during the years of the Caliphate (7th‚Äì19th centuries) In addition to its strategic location, the city established itself as one of Libya's oldest producers of luxury carpets.Ham, p. 119. The Misrata tribe, a section of the larger Berber Hawwara confederacy, inhabited the coastal region of Tripolitania during the Roman and early Arab eras. Ottoman era The region of Tripolitania, which included Misrata, came under the regency of the Ottoman Empire in 1551. By the beginning of the 19th century, Misrata had been established as a major center for the Trans-Saharan trade route, where caravans carrying gold, leather, and slaves, regularly stopped. Because of the rainfall along the coast, which was abundant compared to other cities in Tripolitania, and supplemental water from underground springs, Misrata's inhabitants were able to engage in unusually fertile agriculture in this largely arid region. The city was filled with thick areas of vegetable gardens while the surrounding countryside included fields of wheat, barley, date palms and olive orchards. Misrata's artisans also expanded on the city's ancient carpet industry for which it was regionally renowned. Although Misrata contained a well-built harbor, most of its long-distance trade was overland because the city of Benghazi to the east served as the preferable substitute for maritime shipping. As a result of the abolition of slavery and increasing European colonial influence in Sub-Saharan Africa, Trans-Saharan trade declined and consequently Misrata's role in the trade decreased. However, the decline in Trans-Saharan trade saw the establishment of weekly and permanent markets in the city, replacing the seasonal markets associated with long- distance trade. Because of this new economic situation, the residents of the countryside devoted less time to pastoralism, husbandry and guide service for foreign traders and began to shift their focus on agricultural production. Farmers concentrated on growing cash crops, relying on market relations to provide income for their families, instead of subsistence farming and periodic barter exchanging. Bedouins increasingly abandoned their nomadic lifestyle and began to settle into permanent dwellings within the city limits. To cope with an rising population due to immigration from the surrounding areas, Misrata witnessed a construction boom in the late 19th century. A covered produce market and numerous streets lined with shops were built in addition to new district and municipal government offices, a renovated Ottoman army barracks and several Turkish-style houses for the city's wealthy families. The Old City of Misrata, 1930s Misrata Sea fishing port Two clans, the Muntasir and Adgham, dominated the political, social and economic aspects of Misrata and led the local tribes against their Turkish overlords during various periods of tension. There were many wealthy families in the city, but the Muntasirs, who were of Arabian descent, and the Adghams, who descended from Ottoman officers who settled in the province in previous centuries, were the most prominent. They made their income from commerce and protected their wealth by cooperating with the Ottoman provincial authorities. Both had extended families and economic holdings not just in Misrata, but also the provincial capital of Tripoli as well as the eastern Cyrenican towns of Benghazi and Derna. The Aghdams had traditionally resisted efforts by the central Ottoman government in Istanbul to reestablish direct control over Tripoli Province and, under the leadership of Osman al-Aghdam, they led a rebellion against the Ottomans and their local allies in 1835. After their eventual defeat in 1858, they were left in an inferior position to that of the Muntasirs. The Aghdams remained a powerful force nonetheless and their competition with the Muntasirs for leading positions within the local and regional government dominated Misratan politics. Misrata's urban residents did not contribute much to the political scene and avoided contact with the Ottoman authorities out of concern of conscription into the army and provincial tax collection. In contrast, the rural areas of Misrata were populated mostly by fellahin (peasantry) and former Bedouins who had retained their tribal affiliations and loyalties and thus involved themselves in competition for political influence. Up until 1908, the Muntasirs, led by Umar al-Muntasir, controlled the upper echelons of the newly organized bureaucracy in Tripoli Province and were largely accepted by the local notables as the administrators of Misrata along with Sirte, Gharyan and Tarhuna. However, that year, the Young Turks acquired power in Istanbul and ousted the traditional Ottoman leadership. Viewing the Muntasirs as loyalists of Abdul Hamid II, the ousted sultan, they made efforts to reduce Muntasir power in the region. The Young Turk administration in Tripoli vetoed Muntasir membership in the local parliament and dismissed the governor of Tarhuna who was Umar al-Muntasir's son, Ahmad Dhiya al-Muntasir, from his post. In addition, they allegedly hired a group of local Misratans to assassinate Abd al-Qasim, another one Umar's sons. Italian occupation Entrance to Misrata, 1941 In October 1911, Italy had launched an invasion against Ottoman Tripolitania, but were unable to reach Misrata until June 1912. Ahmad Dhiya al-Muntasir had consulted with the Italians in Rome months prior to the invasion and Umar al-Muntasir used his influence to coordinate with them militarily once they landed on the Libyan coastline. In return for their collaboration, the Muntasirs were able to maintain their administrative role and gained positions as advisers to the Italian military authorities. During World War I, Misrata played an important role in the Libyan-Ottoman resistance against the occupying Italian Army. Under the leadership of Ramadan al-Swehli, the city was used a base of support for the Ottoman Empire and his Misratan army dealt a major blow to the Italians at Qasr Abu Hadi near Sirte in April 1915. Over 500 Italian troops were killed while Swehli's troops captured over 5,000 rifles, various types of machine guns and artillery and several tons of ammunition. As a result of this Libyan victory, Italy's army and their Muntasir allies withdrew from Misrata. By 1916, Misrata had become semi-autonomous and collected taxes from Sirte, the region of Fezzan and the area between it and Sirte as well as the Warfalla tribal area south of Tripoli. Because of its strategic harbor, Ottoman and German forces used Misrata as one of their principal supply ports during World War I. The city became the headquarters of a wide-ranging administration which supervised military recruitment and tax collection, had its own ammunition factory, printed its own currency and operated its own schools and hospitals. However, once Nuri Bey, the Ottoman officer in charge of the Libyan front, was recalled to Istanbul in early 1918, Ottoman influence waned in Misrata. Suwayhli lost his main backer and a huge source of funding as a result. When the Italians reestablished their control of much of Libya following their victory in World War I, but al-Swehli retained his position as administrator of Misrata. In 1920 he expelled his Italian adviser from Misrata and controlled the town independently with about 10,000 fighters. Al Rakib, a Tripoli-based newspaper, commended the order and security in place at Misrata under al-Swehli as well as the strict application of Islamic law including the suppression of hard liquor. In June, however, al-Swehli attempted to attack the Muntasirs and Warfalla in the area between Misrata and Tripoli, but his forces were defeated and al-Swehli was executed by Abd al-Qadir al-Muntasir's troops. A few weeks after the battle, the new Italian governor attacked Misrata. During the mid-1920s and 1930s, Misrata became a center of Italian colonization. A new town was laid out on a grid pattern and several public buildings were constructed including a new municipal office, the first hospital of the area, a modern state-of-the-art church (which was later converted to a mosque) and a large hotel. Giuseppe Volpi was named Conte di Misrata, or the \\"Count of Misrata.\\" In 1935 the construction of the road connecting Zuwara in the west to Misrata was completed. Later in 1937 was built the Via Balbia, a main road that connected Misrata with Tripoli and Benghazi, and in 1938 Libya governor Italo Balbo created on the outskirts of Misrata the new cities of \\"Gioda\\" and \\"Crispi\\" In January 1939, the Kingdom of Italy created the 4th Shore, with Libya's four coastal provinces of Tripoli, Misrata, Bengasi, and Derna becoming an integral part of metropolitan Italy. The last railway development in Libya done by the Italians was the \\"Tripoli-Benghazi line\\" that was started in 1941 and was never completed because of the Italian defeat during World War II: a new railway station was built in Misrata, but was destroyed by the British attacks in 1942Italian railways in colonial Libya (in italian) Independence In response to alleged vote rigging during the 1952 parliamentary elections, Misrata witnessed mass riots which contributed to the Libyan monarchy's permanent ban on political parties. Following Muammar Gaddafi's coup that overthrew the monarchy of King Idris in 1969, Misrata grew rapidly from the 1970s onward. Two iron and steel mills were established in the city resulting in a mass migration of Libyans from nearby rural areas to Misrata and consequently generated population and economic growth. The marina was rapidly developed to host shipping to service the steel plants and other factories with raw materials and other goods. During this period Misrata became the principal economic, educational and administrative center of eastern Tripolitania. The majority of government ministries have branch offices in the city in addition to several college universities, schools and hospitals. The commercial area of Misrata contains numerous shops, restaurants, and cafes. The extensive development of the city attracted large numbers of immigrants to Misrata, giving it a cosmopolitan atmosphere. The main square adjacent to the old souk resembles those of major Moroccan cities. Revolution Starting on 20 February 2011, small demonstrations took place in Misrata in solidarity with anti-government protesters in Benghazi. Libyan police immediately arrested the Misratan protesters, sparking larger demonstrations which Libyan government forces sought to quell using live ammunition. Within a few days, 70 protesters were killed provoking outrage among the city's inhabitants.Rice, Xan. Libyan rebels pay a heavy price for resisting Gaddafi in Misrata . The Guardian. 2011-04-21. Retrieved on 2012-02-11. By 24 February, Benghazi fell under the control of anti-Gaddafi forces in the Libyan uprising against Gaddafi. That same day, Gaddafi regime forces attempted to wrest control of the city, but were repelled.Filiu, p. 86. The battle was renewed with shelling on 20 March as pro-Gaddafi tanks and artillery pushed forward and besieged Misrata. Eyewitnesses reported that pro- Gaddafi soldiers were shooting, killing and injuring unarmed civilians. The city was shelled by artillery, tanks, and snipers, and for over 40 days and had its water supply shut off by Gaddafi's forces. By late April, over 1,000 people in the city were reported killed while around 3,000 were injured. With air support from NATO which entered the conflict on the rebels' side on March 19, and a vital sea-based life line from neighbouring country the Island of Malta, anti-Gaddafi forces managed to force loyalist troops to retreat on April 21, gaining control of most of the city by mid-May.Filiu, p. 87. Thereafter, forces from Misrata played an important role in other theaters of the war, such as the Battle of Tripoli, the Battle of Sirte and the Battle of Bani Walid (2011). Geography Misrata lies on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea east of Tripoli and west of Benghazi. The location of the city creates a dualism of sea and sand, bounded by the sea to the north and east and to the south by golden sands dotted with palm and olive trees. Like Benghazi and Tripoli, Misrata is divided into two distinct sections. Older Misrata consists of small stone houses and narrow arched streets while the newer part of the city, which began to develop in the 20th century, consists of modern buildings, homes, factories and industrial areas. Aside from its distinct location, which makes it a centre for the exchange of commodities and materials with the rest of the cities of the country, Misrata has modern infrastructure, including paved roads, electricity and communications. Climate K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies its climate as hot semi-arid (BSh). Demographics The city is considered to be the \\"main center of the Turkish-origin community in Libya\\"; in total, the Turks form approximately two-thirds (est.270,000 in 2019) of Misrata's 400,000 inhabitants. Economy Goz Teek Hotel in Misrata Serving the role of Libya's commercial hub, Misrata is notably clean and construction is well-organized. Its citizens are largely viewed by other Libyans as business oriented. The city's steel mill industry (which is dominated by the government-owned Libyan Iron and Steel Company) is one its principal income producers and sources of employment. Due to the 1970s-80s renovation of Misrata's marina to better supply the industrial plants with raw material, the industry has been able to expand and the steel mill authorities hold considerable influence in the city. Al-Naseem Dairy, one of the largest private companies in Libya, is also located in Misrata and employs around 750 workers.Young, Rob. Libya's commercial hub recovers slowly . BBC News. BBC. 2012-01-03. Accessed on 2012-01-07. A historic aspect of the local economy is the cloth and textile industry. Situated near the city's central square are souks (\\"open-air markets\\") where, usually three times a week, merchants continue to sell luxury carpets, furniture cloth and traditional clothing, including abayas (cloaks worn by males for celebratory occasions.) Most major businesses, shops and social centers are located on Tripoli Street, Misrata's main thoroughfare. During the Siege of Misrata, most of the buildings housing these assets were destroyed. However, several small businesses are beginning to rebuild and reopen.

Once the Libyan Central Bank receives most of the assets that had been internationally frozen during the civil war, it is probable that local banks would ease these restrictions.
