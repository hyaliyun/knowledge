It is also popular as a face cream for women. The natural ingredients now include olive oil, camomile oil and vanilla.

As the word spread through parenting websites, with many women praising its softening and firming effect, the product sold out at many stores. In 2008, the product sold eight years worth of stock in just four months following this buzz.

He met Audrey Diwan, a French writer and series editor at Denoël, which published his first novel, Camping Atlantic, in June 2005. The novel deals with teenage violence and boredom, and with the strength of brotherhood, through the story of the protagonist, Adonis. Subsequently, Kenig dedicated himself to theater, writing three plays : Elle t'embrasse, Pas ce soir et Pompéi ou le suspense pornographique, before publishing his second novel, La Pause, in 2006, a work of social fiction that brings the reader to the suburbs of Paris and the industrial plants of carmaker Renault, and features Kenig's introspection and sociological observation. He then turned to other genres and published a pamphletary essay, Quitter la France, in which he analyses what remains of the French identity, a few weeks before Nicolas Sarkozy’s victory at the French presidential election.

She petitioned but failed to save Julius and Ethel Rosenberg from execution for conspiracy to commit espionage. Biography Helen Levitov was born in Washington, D.C. Her parents, Max and Rose, were Yiddish-speaking Jews from the Russian Empire who immigrated to the United States in 1909 and 1908, respectively. As a child, she contracted polio. During her lifetime, she attended Wilson Teachers College. Throughout World War II she worked at the National Bureau of Standards as a spectrometer technician. In 1938, Levitov married Clarence Darrow Gurewitz. They divorced seven years later, in 1945. Levitov went to work at the General Electric Company in Schenectady, New York, where she met, then married, Morton Sobell. Levitov Sobell then studied physics at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Levitov Sobell moved to New York City in 1947 and was, three years later, awarded an M.S. in physics from Columbia University. After being accused of spying, she and her husband fled to Mexico. They were abducted on August 16, 1950, by Mexican agents and turned over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. She was not prosecuted, but her husband was convicted of \\"conspiracy to commit espionage\\" and sentenced to 30 years in federal prison. She campaigned to save the Rosenbergs from execution, raising more than $1 million for their defense. She also fought to have her husband's conviction overturned, filing eight unsuccessful appeals and even leasing the main stage at Carnegie Hall where she hosted the \\"Committee to Secure Justice for Morton Sobell\\" on May 15, 1956. In 1956, she published a book of poems, You, Who Love Life. She then taught science at the Elisabeth Irwin High School. Her husband was released from prison in 1969. In 1980, at the age of 62, she earned her Ph.D. in computer education from Teachers College, Columbia University. The Sobells also separated in 1980. They formally divorced the following year, after which she moved to San Francisco. There, she taught briefly at Contra Costa College before retiring. She also became an active member of the Gray Panthers. After suffering from Alzheimer’s disease for a decade, she died on April 15, 2002 at a nursing home in Redwood City, California.

He was the father of cameralist Christoph Wilhelm Jacob Gatterer (1759–1838) and poet Magdalena Philippine Engelhard (1756–1831). He was a member of the Göttingen School of History. From 1747 he studied theology at Altdorf, where his interest later changed to history. In 1752 he became a school teacher of history and geography in Nuremberg, and in 1756 gained his professorship in natural history. In 1759 he was appointed professor of history at the University of Göttingen, where he remained for the next forty years. Gatterer was a pioneer of \\"universal history\\", and with fellow Göttingen historian August Ludwig von Schlözer (1735–1809), he was instrumental in developing a modern, hermeneutical approach to history. He believed that historical events needed to be systematically arranged by describing their causal relationships, rather than simply providing a chronology of events. Gatterer used the phrase nexus rerum universalis to represent \\"a universal connection of things in the world\\". His focus dealt largely with ancillary disciplines such as genealogy, heraldry, diplomatics, and physical geography, and he treated these subjects from a modern scientific viewpoint. Gatterer promoted his ideas on these subjects in the journals Allgemeine historische Bibliothek (1767–1771) and Historisches Journal (1772–1781). Since 1954 the \\"Johann Christoph-Gatterer Medal\\" is awarded by the Genealogisch-Heraldische Gesellschaft Göttingen (GHGG) for scientific achievements in the field of genealogy and heraldry. In 1785 Gatterer estimated that the time span from Creation to the birth of Christ to be 4181 years.Time and Archaeology edited by Professor of Archaeology, Tim Murray  Selected works  * Handbuch der neuesten Genealogie und Heraldik, 1750 - Handbook on the latest genealogy and heraldry. * Johann Christoph Gatterers ...

The M4 motorway passes just north of it. According to the Post Office the population of the village was included in the civil parish of Welford at the 2011 Census. Archaeology Wickham is on the course of a Roman road that linked Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester) with Corinium Dobunnorum (Cirencester). Many traces have been found in Welford parish of habitation when Britain was under Roman rule.Page & Ditchfield, 1924, pages 116–125 Parish church The Church of England parish church of Saint Swithin has a Saxon tower,Pevsner, 1966, page 266 built probably in the 11th century. It seems to have been built originally as a free-standing defensive tower. Later a nave and small chancel were added to form a chapel of ease for Wickham, which in the Middle Ages was a hamlet of Welford. By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 the Benedictine Abingdon Abbey seems to have held the parish church at Welford and its chapel at Wickham. During the reign of Henry I (between 1100 and 1135) St. Swithin's had to provide of candle-wax per year for the altar at Abingdon Abbey. In 1396 St. Swithin's paid 50 shillings per year to the Abbey in lieu of of candle-wax. A Jacobean pulpit was installed in St. Swithun's in 1629 and a north aisle was added in 1827. The church tower has only one bell. It was cast in 1617 and bears the initials \\"R P\\". In 1845 the nave, chancel and north aisle were all demolished. Between 1845 and 1849 a new church was built with a nave, chancel and both north and south aisles in a Decorated Gothic style, and a Norman Revival style bell-chamber was added to the top of the tower. All were designed by the Gothic Revival architect Benjamin Ferrey, who included carved \\"Norfolk angels\\" supporting the nave roof and eight papier maché elephants' heads appearing to support the aisle roof. The pipe organ built in 1851 was by Henry Bevington. Wickham House A rectory at Wickham seems to have been built during the reign of Henry II (between 1154 and 1189). However, the present building dates from the 18th century. Ferrey greatly enlarged and altered it, adding a tower, spire and remarkable Gothic Revival bay window. The Jacobean pulpit from St. Swithun's was dismantled and its panels used to make a cupboard in the servants' hall of the house. In 1852 St. Gregory's parish church at Welford was also demolished and a new Gothic Revival church built in its place. Extensive carved stonework was salvaged from St. Gregory's and re-used to decorate the rectory garden at Wickham. A vinery was built using six Perpendicular Gothic windows, five being 15th-century originals and the sixth a modern copy. A 15th-century doorway and some 13th-century windows were also included in the vinery. Elsewhere in the garden two 15th-century piers from the south aisle and many other fragments from St. Gregory's were set up. The remains of St. Gregory's were still in the rectory garden in 1924 but all had been demolished before 1966, along with the tall spire on the house. The building is no longer a rectory and is now called Wickham House. Social and economic history The Domesday Book recorded five mills in the manor of Welford, but it is not clear if any of these were at Wickham. No later record is known of any mill in the parish. By 1275–76 an annual royal fair was held at Wickham. In 1924 there was still an annual Wickham Feast on Saint Swithun's patronal festival, 15 July. An open field system of farming prevailed until 1820, when the common lands of Wickham and most of the rest of Welford parish were inclosed. By 1924 Welford parish had an elementary school and it was at Wickham.

The station opened in 1937 and closed in 1967.  History  The station came about in 1937 when, in response to holiday camp development in the area, the Southern Railway decided to realign its branch line to New Romney (which had been opened in 1884) closer to the sea and to open two intermediate stations - Lydd-on-Sea and Greatstone-on-Sea. Greatstone was convenient for Greatstone Camp and Maddieson's Holiday Camp and competed with services provided by the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway (RHDR) which had already been operating in the area for a decade. The station was equipped with basic facilities consisting of a long single platform on the up side with a simple shelter. An extensive concrete forecourt was, however, provided for the coaches which were expected to ferry in crowds of holidaymakers.Subterranea Britannica, \\"Greatstone-on-Sea Halt\\". The failure of Greatstone to develop into a substantial holiday resort, coupled with the inconvenient siting of the station by comparison with the RHDR's Greatstone Dunes and Romney Sands stations, led to it being downgraded to an unstaffed halt in 1954. As passenger traffic continued to dwindle and freight became insignificant, the New Romney branch fell into decline and was listed for closure in the Beeching Report. In 1966 the Minister of Transport Barbara Castle announced her intention of closing the Appledore to New Romney Branch and passenger services ceased on 6 March 1967.Oppitz, L., op. cit. p. 82.  Present day  Although the trackbed from Romney Junction towards New Romney is easily traceable, nothing remains of Greatstone-on-Sea Halt today except for the concrete forecourt, which is used for parking, and a slightly raised area of ground where the platform once lay. The platform was demolished in the 1980s and an access road to a school car park crosses the platform area.

The village was named by Captain Benjamin Ledyard, who settled there in 1793, in the post-Revolutionary development of the Finger Lakes region. Up until the mid-nineteenth century, Aurora played an important part in the history of Central New York. County seat for first Onondaga County and later Cayuga County, the village was also a leading market town in the region. A steam-powered flour mill was built in 1817, the first of its kind west of Albany, contributing to Aurora's importance as a commercial center. Aurora was a major shipping point for goods bound up the Lake and through the Erie Canal, until the canal's role was replaced by railroads in the mid-19th century. Its significant business entrepreneurs included men such as Henry Wells, founder of American Express and Wells Fargo, whose operations created new express mail and banking services that spanned New York state and reached to the developing state of California. Having earned capital in shipping and trade, Edwin Barber Morgan invested with Wells and served as a director for Wells Fargo for years. In addition, Morgan founded the United States Express Company, which provided express mail to the South, and he was an important early investor in The New York Times. They and other successful men built ambitious grand houses in the village, an architectural legacy which has contributed to its significance. With wealth, Aurora's capitalists supported education. Wells founded Wells Seminary, later Wells College, in 1868, starting Aurora's second period of historic significance. Morgan also supported the college. In 1980, the Aurora Village–Wells College Historic District was entered on the National Register of Historic Places. and Accompanying 33 photos from 1977-1980 Aurora Village properties The contributing properties in the village of Aurora are of varied styles and vintage. They include commercial buildings, the Masonic temple, three churches, many homes, some barns and two cemeteries. Commercial properties The vernacular-design Patrick Tavern was built in 1793 and is the oldest building in the village. Built in 1898, the Tudor Revival style Aurora Free Library/Morgan Opera House served until 1996 as the Public Library/Town Hall, as it was originally intended by benefactor Louise Morgan Zabriskie. The brick, Greek Revival style Aurora Inn was built in 1833. A complete renovation was completed in 2003. The Shakelton Funeral Home is a large, white, neo-classical wooden structure built in 1903-1904. Solomon Myers, a mason, built The Bank of local limestone circa 1840 for use as his home. In 1864 the second owner sold the building to a consortium forming the First National Bank of Aurora. At that time, several physical improvements were made and the Italianate features were added before the bank opened. Edwin Barber Morgan, a leading citizen of Aurora, had the E. B. Morgan House built in 1857-1858. It was designed by New York City architect Joseph C. Wells, who also designed the Presbyterian Church in Aurora. The imposing stone mansion on the shore of Cayuga Lake now operates as a bed and breakfast inn. Other commercial properties that contribute to the district include: the Shakelton Hardware Store, the Aurora Office Building, Mack's Drug Store, the Aurora Village Hall, the White Elephant Shop, the Aurora IGA, and the Thompson Block.

Morgan House Scipio Lodge #110 Masonic Lodge Robert Livingston, who administered George Washington's oath of office and was Grand Master of the Masons, signed the charter for the Masonic Lodge in Aurora, received in 1797. It is known as the Scipio Lodge #110. New York State Governor DeWitt Clinton, also Grand Master of the Masons, laid the cornerstone for the existing structure in 1819. The Masonic emblems incorporated in the design of the structure survive to this day. Churches Three churches contribute to the historic district. The Presbyterian Church, built in 1860, is of Romanesque design, with a Gothic steeple. It was designed by New York City architect Joseph C. Wells, who also designed the E. B. Morgan House. St. Paul's Episcopal Church is Greek Revival in style and was built in 1870-1871. It is located on the east side of Main Street. Across the street is St. Patrick's Catholic Church, built in 1873 of Italianate design. Both were designed by local architect Samuel Mandell. Image:St._Paul's_Episcopal_Church.jpgSt. Paul's Episcopal Church Image:St._Patrick's_Catholic_Church.jpgSt. Patrick's Catholic Church Homes Over fifty homes contribute to the historic district, too many to enumerate. The imposing Taylor House on the east side of Main Street was built around 1838 and was the site of many village celebrations. Mandell House was built by local architect Samuel Mandell for his own use. It is designed in a combination of Queen Anne and Stick styles. The romantic Queen Anne-style Abbott House is at the northern end of town. The Leffingwell House was the first house built of brick in Aurora, circa 1826. The Cuyler House is the birthplace of Theodore Ledyard Cuyler, Presbyterian clergyman and writer, according to the historical marker in the front yard. The Federal-style Peter Fort House was built in 1819-1820. Image:Taylor_House,_E_side_Main.jpgTaylor House Image:S._Mandel_House.jpgMandell House Image:Cuyler_birthplace.jpgCuyler House Wells College In 1868, Wells Seminary, later Wells College, was founded by Henry Wells, founder of American Express (1850) and Wells Fargo (1852). The campus includes fourteen properties contributing to the historic district. Glen Park, built in 1852, was originally the home of Henry Wells and later donated to the college. The house was designed in two sections, the original portion by architect Calvin N. Otis, and the second by Samuel Mandell, architect of the original Wells College Main Building (Dieckman, 1995). Another event in the life of Henry Wells happened in 1850 -- he moved with his family from New York City to Aurora to a large house that stood on the east side of Court Street in the middle of what is now Cherry Avenue. This house burned May 18, 1851, and he began planning his new home immediately. His choice of a location for his home could scarcely have turned out better either for him or for Wells College. It was part of a farm, just south of Aurora, formerly owned by John Morgan, one of the six sons of Christopher Morgan. Henry Wells purchased thirty-eight acres of this farm, a strip of land beginning at Cayuga Lake and running eastward north of the ravine. He named his estate Glen Park and located his residence on the north side of Glen Park Ravine. The following description of Glen Park is taken from a prospectus written in 1875. \\"The house is of Tuscan villa architecture -- the outer walls are of blue limestone, the inner of brick with a chamber between, rendering them impervious to dampness and making the rooms cool in summer and warm in winter. The partitions of the main building are of brick from the foundations upward. The halls and rooms are spacious and sunny, commanding charming views from each window.\\" On the newel at the bottom of the circular staircase in Glen Park is a silver plate engraved as follows: \\"C. N. Otis, Architect; N. H. McGrath, Builder. Erected A.D., 1852.\\" This circular staircase is one of Glen Park's unique features. Miss Annie MeGreevey, Mr. Mandell's housekeeper for many years, tells the story of its building. Samuel D. Mandell (1829-1917), educated as an architect, began his career away from Aurora. Early in 1852 his father wrote him that there would be plenty of work in Aurora and that he should come home. Mandell arrived just before Glen Park was completed. The architect had left the well for the circular staircase, but had postponed building it because he was not sure how best to do it. When he heard that Mandell had returned, he asked him to construct the staircase. The circular staircase in Glen Park, therefore, was the first work that Mandell did in Aurora. Afterward he was the architect of the first Wells College building, the three churches, and several residences including that of Edwin B. Morgan. Pettibone House is a Gothic Revival structure built of stone in 1858. The Main Building was built in 1890. The Wells College Boathouse, on Cayuga Lake, was built in 1898. The science building, Zabriskie Hall, was built in 1905. The remaining nine contributing properties on campus are Fritt House, Power House, Boyer Cottage, Macmillan Hall, South Hall, Bellinjou, Dining Hall, Cleveland Hall, and Morgan Hall. In addition, the noted architecture firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill designed the Louis Jefferson Long Library according to the \\"Field Theory\\" in 1968.

The Paulician dialect is spoken by some 40,000 people, nearly all of them Catholic Bulgarians, in the region of Rakovski in southern Bulgaria and Svishtov in northern Bulgaria. The language of the Banat Bulgarians, late 17th century Bulgarian Catholic migrants to Banat, is phonologically and morphologically identical to the Paulician dialect (Banat Bulgarian language). However, as a result of its three-century separation from Standard Bulgarian and its close interaction with German and Hungarian, Banat Bulgarian has adopted a number of loanwords not present in Standard Bulgarian and a Croatian-based Latin alphabet and is therefore now considered to be one of the three literary forms of Modern Bulgarian. The Paulician dialect is almost entirely surrounded by the Central Balkan dialect. It keeps many archaic characteristics and thus represents an older stage of development of the Rhodopean dialects. Other ex-Paulicians - the \\"Lovech Pomaks\\" in northern Bulgaria speak the Galata dialect, which covers the regiolects of the villages: Galata, Gradeshnitsa, Bulgarski Izvor, Kirchevo (Pomashka Leshnitsa), Dobrevtsi, and Rumyantsevo (Blasnichevo).

Playing career  During the past several seasons Denis Parshin has been playing for HC CSKA Moscow in the KHL. Internationally, he was a member of the U18 and then U20 Russian National team. The young forward has also been a member of Russia's senior national team during EuroTour competition that largely takes place between the four European hockey nations (Russia, Sweden, Finland, and Czech Republic). Parshin was drafted by the Colorado Avalanche in the third round 72nd overall in the 2004 NHL Entry Draft. On June 1, 2011, Parshin signed a three-year contract extension to remain with CSKA. During his tenth season with CSKA in 2012–13, after scoring 2 points in 9 games, Parshin was traded to fellow KHL club Salavat Yulaev Ufa in exchange for Igor Grigorenko on October 10, 2012. Parshin continued to struggle offensively with Salavat to post 5 goals in 29 games before ending the season on the injured list. In the off-season, Parshin tenure with Salavat was ended when he was traded, along with Sergei Sentyurin, to Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod in exchange for Dmitri Makarov on May 5, 2013. In May 2014, Parshin signed a three-year deal to play for Siberian side Avangard Omsk, where he became the clubs topscrorer in his first season with a personal record of 25 goals and 56 points. In the final year of his contract with Omsk, Parshin began the 2016–17 season, amongst the club's top two-scoring lines. In 28 games, he contributed with 5 goals and 12 points before he was traded in return to Salavat Yulaev Ufa on November 24, 2016. On the opening day of free agency in the following summer, Parshin returned to another former club, agreeing to a one-year deal with Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod on May 1, 2017. In remaining with Torpedo through the 2018–19 season, Parshin posted his highest offensive totals since 2015, collecting 16 goals and 41 points through 61 games. Having left Torpedo for a second time as a free agent, Parshin agreed to a two-year contract with Metallurg Magnitogorsk on May 1, 2019. In the ensuing 2019–20 season, Parshin notched 10 goals in 49 games with Metallurg before he left nearing completion of the regular season to join his first club outside Russia with HC Košice of the Slovak Extraliga on February 16, 2020. Parshin registered 4 points in 9 games with Košice before the remainder of the season was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a free agent, Parshin opted to extend his career in returning to the KHL and agreeing to a one-year contract with Latvian based, Dinamo Riga, on 3 August 2020.

Beneath the turf and just inside the later Sarsen Circle are a double arc of buried stoneholes, the only surviving evidence of the first stone structure (possibly a double stone circle) erected within the centre of Stonehenge (Figs.1 & 2) and currently regarded as instigating the period known as Stonehenge Phase 3i. This phase tentatively began as early as 2600 BC, although recent radiocarbon dates from samples retrieved from one of the sockets in 2008 during excavations by Darvill and Wainwright suggest a date of around 2400 to 2300 BC. The final report is yet to be published, but some interesting results follow from the partial excavation of Q Hole 13 where 'associations with Beaker pottery' were noted.Timothy Darvill and Geoffrey Wainwright Stonehenge excavations 2008. The Antiquaries Journal, Published online by Cambridge University Press 21 Apr 2009 Although first encountered by William Hawley in the 1920s, it was Richard Atkinson who formally identified and named these irregular settings in 1954: ‘In choosing this designation, I had in mind John Aubrey’s frequent use, as a marginal note…of the phrase ‘quaere quot’ – ‘inquire how many’ – which seemed appropriate to the occasion.’ Atkinson, R J C, Stonehenge (Penguin Books, 1979) p.58 Their place at the beginning of the stone monument phase has been recognized from their stratigraphic relationships: in places they were cut through by both the settings of the later and still partly surviving Bluestone Circle and also by a stonehole dug for one of the uprights of the Sarsen Circle.Cleal, R. M. J., Walker, K. E. & Montague, R., Stonehenge in its landscape (English Heritage, London, 1995) p.578 Fig.2 The Q and R Holes, their location in relation to the later stone monument. Zoom to full extent to view Q & R settings Description The diameter of the outer (Q) circuit is c. 26.2 m and that of the inner (R) is, 22.5 m; with an average spacing between the paired stone settings of 1.5 m. These trench-like intrusions are roughly 2 m long and 1 m wide, set radially and slightly enlarged at each end to provide paired stone sockets to a depth of around 0.6 m, the intervening strip generally re-filled with chalk rubble. Fig.3 The Q and R Holes, possibly 40 paired settings. The Stonehenge axis was established when the inset 'portal settings' were added on the northeast (after Johnson 2008)Atkinson described them as being ‘dumb-bell’ shaped, although not all were of this form. The bases of some sockets bore ‘the impressions…of heavy stones’ some with ‘minute chips of dolerite [i.e. bluestone] embedded. While this does not imply that only bluestones were used in the Q and R structure he found no evidence for sarsens. His accounts make it clear that he believed the sockets to have exclusively located bluestones 'presumably the same stones that are still at Stonehenge'.Atkinson 1979, p.58 Interpretation Atkinson estimated that if the Q and R Holes originally formed a complete circle that 38 pairs would have been present,Atkinson 1979, p.60 although recent computer-modeling shows that there is actually room for 40.Darvill, Timothy, Stonehenge, The Biography of a Landscape (Tempus 2006), pp.119-121 Johnson, Anthony, Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma (Thames & Hudson, 2008) pp.129-134 The Q and R Holes not only represent the foundation cuts for the first central stone construction, but they also were to include several additional stone settings on the northeast. This modified group face the midsummer sunrise with a possible reciprocal stone aligned on the midwinter sunset. This is the first evidence for any unambiguous alignment at Stonehenge (the solstice axis). The analysis of the spacing between the Q and R array, and that of the modified (inset) portal group (Fig.3) imply a shift from an angular splay of 9 degrees (i.e. 40 settings) to 12 degrees, the same as that of the later 30 Sarsen Circle. How long the bluestones remained in the Q and R settings before they were removed (if indeed this early structure was ever completed) is not known. However the dates suggested from the 2008 excavation (above) implies the Q & R arrays were perhaps no earlier than 2,400 BC, presenting a challenge to the recently accepted Late Neolithic date for the construction of the iconic sarsen monument.

It was the first graduated brake for goods trains in Europe. When it was introduced after the First World War, goods train brakes switched from hand operation to compressed-air in various European countries. The Deutsche Reichsbahn alone put the cost of equipping German goods wagons with Kunze-Knorr brakes between 1918 and 1927 at 478.4 million Reichsmarks. The operating cost savings from faster goods services and having fewer brakemen was assessed by the Reichsbahn at almost 96.3 million Reichsmark annually. Inventors The Kunze-Knorr brake brought together the ideas of Prussian senior surveyor, Bruno Kunze (1854–1935), and preparatory work by the founder of Knorr-Bremse, Georg Knorr (1859–1911). It was the first, continuous, compressed-air brake that, even on long goods trains, enabled the brake force not only to be applied gradually, but also released again gradually. By combining a single-stage and a two-stage brake cylinder with a compound brake a significant increase in brake effort was achieved. Brake versions Three versions of the brake were developed: for goods trains (KKgbr), passenger trains (KKpbr) and express trains (KKsbr). The goods wagon variant offered the option of switching between empty and loaded braking. The passenger train version was given an accelerator valve (Beschleunigungsventil) as well as a control valve. The express train brake had, in addition, a brake pressure regulator in order to prevent the wheels locking when braking quickly. Knorr-Bremse The Kunze-Knorr brake was developed and manufactured by the firm of Knorr-Bremse AG in Berlin. It was also produced by their subsidiary company Süddeutsche Bremsen-AG at what is nowadays the head office of Knorr-Bremse AG in Munich. A total of about 550,000 Kunze-Knorr brake control valves were made, some under licence. In the 1930s they were superseded by the Hildebrand-Knorr brake (Hik brake). In many places, including the Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany, they were still regularly in use until the 1960s.

He was a pitcher in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cleveland Indians, Washington Senators and Detroit Tigers over all or parts of seven seasons spanning 1942–51. Listed at tall and , he batted and threw right-handed. In 109 MLB games (27 as a starting pitcher) and 301⅔ innings pitched, Calvert allowed 345 hits and 158 bases on balls. He struck out 102, threw five complete games and earned five saves. Born in Montreal, Quebec, Calvert broke into professional baseball in 1938. He spent most of the year playing in the Quebec Provincial League, at the time a minor league unaffiliated with MLB. He then played in three games for the Montreal Royals, and showed enough promise that the New York Giants gave him a tryout, but they passed on signing him as they felt he needed more experience. After spending 1939 out of organized baseball, Calvert was signed by the Cleveland Indians organization to a contract in 1940, and was invited to spring training. He then spent the season with the Cedar Rapids Raiders of the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League and the Wilkes-Barre Barons of the Eastern League, playing in 21 total games for the two teams. He spent 1941 with Cedar Rapids, and finished the year with six wins, three losses, and a 2.39 earned run average (ERA) in 11 games. He signed with the Cleveland organization and in 1942 he won 17 of 24 decisions with a 2.22 ERA with Wilkes-Barre. That led to his call up to the Indians' roster when he made his MLB debut with two scoreless innings against the Chicago White Sox on September 24 in his only major league appearance of the season. Calvert spent three full seasons—1944, 1949, and 1950—in the big leagues. His most notable campaign, 1949 with the Senators, saw him lead the American League in games lost (17) and in pitchers' fielding percentage (1.000 in 55 chances). His minor league career essentially ended after the 1952 season, although he got into three games in 1955 with the Class C Modesto Reds.

(In 2003, the New Hampshire legislature passed a law renaming the peak as \\"Mount Reagan\\", after President Ronald Reagan, but the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN) voted in May 2010 not to change the name of the mountain.) * Mount Franklin - named for famed inventor and political figure Benjamin Franklin, a sub-peak of Mt. Monroe. * Mount Jackson - named not for President Andrew Jackson as many believe, but for Charles Thomas Jackson, who served as State Geologist for New Hampshire, Maine, and Rhode Island in the late 19th century. * Mount Webster - named for Daniel Webster, famed American statesman and New Hampshire native. Adding these peaks increases total mileage traveled and elevation gain to and . Sub-peaks Several minor peaks ineligible for the list due to lack of prominence have no maintained trails leading to their summits. Hiking off-trail is prohibited; however, some hikers have bushwhacked them as part of a traverse. These include: * Mount Sam Adams - sub-peak of Mt. Adams, named for Samuel Adams (American statesman and second cousin of John Adams) * Mount JQ Adams - sub- peak of Mt. Adams, named for President John Quincy Adams * Mount Abigail Adams - sub-peak of Mt. Adams, named for John Adams' wife Abigail Adams (before being renamed in November 2010, this was Adams IV) * Adams V - an unnamed sub- peak of Mt. Adams  Lodging options  There are several campsites and huts along the route of the Presidential Traverse. It is recommended that hikers use these sites, as camping above treeline is prohibited. * Valley Way Tent Site - Free. First come, first served. This site offers platform-style options for tents. * Madison Springs Hut - Expensive. Co-ed bunk accommodations are offered. * Lakes of the Clouds Hut - Expensive. Co-ed bunk accommodations are offered. * Mitzpah Springs Hut - Expensive. Co-ed bunk accommodations are offered. * Naumann Tent Site - Inexpensive. First come, first served. This site offers platform-style options for tents. A sign warns of harsh terrain ahead. Hazards The White Mountains and the Presidential Range in particular offer both some of the most beautiful vistas in the Eastern United States and some of its most challenging and dangerous terrain. Many hikers attempting a Presidential Traverse have become lost or otherwise disabled in inclement weather above treeline, causing many costly search and rescue operations. Weather A sign warns of dangerous weather. The Presidential Range is perhaps most famous for its tumultuous weather, highlighted by the erratic and often extreme conditions upon Mount Washington and its other summits. Being both at the intersection of several storm tracks and the center of multiple converging valleys funneling wind from the west, southwest, and south make its weather unpredictable and at times violent. The summits of the range have been known to see snow and ice in all seasons, and are subject to a combination of hurricane-force winds and blanketing clouds an average of 110 days a year. Mount Washington long held the record for the highest wind speed ever recorded at the Earth's surface, clocking , forcing summit buildings to be chained down so they won't blow away. =Winter= High winds blow snow off the peak of Mount Washington. Views from the Presidentials ridgeline in the crisp winter air are unrivaled in the Northeast. However, winter terrain is more treacherous, temperatures may plummet with dangerous speed, and wind speeds often hit triple digits. Snowfall at elevation is measured in feet instead of inches, avalanches are common on the large snowfields and in ravines, and blowing snow, ice fog, and heavy clouds can cause visibility to disappear in minutes. Consequently, those wishing to tackle a Presidential Traverse in winter must be exceptionally fit, experienced in winter mountaineering and compass orientation techniques, very familiar with the terrain, and have high quality winter gear. Lacking any one of these puts one in serious peril of requiring expensive and hazardous rescue, even death. Vertical Rugged terrain on the Watson Path A Presidential Traverse does not merely require the absolute gain of some from a starting point to the summit of Mt. Washington; it involves repeated gain and loss of elevation between individual summits along the way. The fact that the range stretches less than from one end to the other and most of its main trails are easily accessible from major through roads errantly suggests that the terrain embraced by the Presidentials lacks remoteness. In truth, the range is a wind- ravaged wilderness. A basic Presidential Traverse encompasses almost of combined vertical, doubled when difficult downclimbing is included. Adding the principal sub-peaks stretches this to almost of up- and downclimb in a single traverse. ReferencesSources # Daniell, G and Smith, S. AMC White Mountain Guide, 27th Edition.

Other types of palm sugar are made from the Kithul palm (Caryota urens), Palmyra palm, the date palm, the sugar date palm, the sago palm or the sugar palm. Used as a sweetener in many countries, coconut sugar has no significant nutritional or health benefits over other sweeteners. Manufacture Coconut sugar comes in crystal or granule form, block or liquid. Producing coconut sugar is a two-step process. It starts with harvesting or \\"tapping\\" the flower bud stem of a coconut tree. Farmers make a cut on the spadix and the sap starts to flow from the cut into bamboo containers. The sap collected is then transferred into large woks and placed over moderate heat to evaporate the moisture content of the sap. The sap is translucent and is about 80% water. At this point it is known as coconut neera or nira (Indonesia), and as coconut toddy (Sri Lanka), maprau (Thailand), or lagbi (North Africa). As the water evaporates, it starts to transform into a thick sap syrup. From this form, it may or may not be further reduced to crystal, block or soft paste form. The brown colour which develops as the sap is reduced is mostly due to caramelization. Culinary use Coconut sugar is widely used in Sri Lanka as an unrefined syrup or as jaggery, referred to as pol hakuru(පොල් හකුරු), though the jaggery made from the Kithul palm is preferred. In Indonesian cuisine coconut sugar is called gula jawa (Javanese sugar) or gula merah (red sugar), while gula aren refers to palm sugar specifically made from aren palm. Some Indonesian foodstuffs are made with coconut sugar, including kecap manis (a sweet soya sauce) and dendeng (a meat preparation). Gula melaka is a Southeast Asian name for palm sugar or \\"malacca sugar\\", probably named for its origin in the state of Malacca, Malaysia. It is usually derived from coconut palms, but sometimes from other palms. It is used in savory dishes, but mainly in local desserts and cakes of the Southeast Asian region. File:Ivinsf.JPGA bowl of gula melaka sago File:Steamed Goan rice and jaggery cakes.jpgPatoleo, a Goan Catholic sweet dish prepared with coconut sugar File:Onde-onde.jpgKlepon; the green flecks within the rice derive from glutinous rice flour mixed with sweet potato and flavored with pandan. File:Ondeh ondeh kueh.jpgKlepon, with palm sugar filling. Taste and flavor Coconut sugar is subtly sweet almost like brown sugar but with a slight hint of caramel. The flavor and sweetness is usually similar to table sugar or brown sugar. However, since coconut sugar is not highly processed, the color, sweetness and flavor can vary depending on the coconut species used, season when it was harvested, where it was harvested and/or the way the \\"sap\\" or \\"toddy\\" was reduced. Nutrition and health claims Although its use as a sweetener has become more common in developed countries, there is no scientific evidence that coconut sugar is more nutritious or healthier than any other sweetener. The nutritive value is similar to the empty calories found in table sugar or brown sugar. The principal carbohydrates of coconut sugar are sucrose (70–79%), glucose, and fructose (3–9% each). The glycemic index (GI) of coconut sugar was reported by the Philippine Coconut Authority to be 35 and by that measure is classified as a low glycemic index food. However, the University of Sydney (Australia) Glycemic Index Research Service measured the GI of coconut sugar to be 54, and considers any GI over 55 to be high.

It was built in the style of a Byzantine basilica, inspired by Hagia Sophia, with the main spires influenced by Transylvanian church architecture and Baroque elements. The idea of building an Orthodox cathedral in Sibiu began with Metropolitan Andrei Şaguna, who in the autumn of 1857 asked Emperor Franz Joseph I for permission to send a circular to his diocese requesting that priests and laymen give donations. He sent the letter before Christmas that year, and the first donor was the Emperor himself, who gave 1000 gold coins, followed by the governor of Transylvania with 50, Şaguna with 2000 florins, and many others. Donations continued to come in following Şaguna's death in 1873; the cornerstone was laid on 18 August 1902, when Ioan Meţianu was Metropolitan. In order to free the space to build the cathedral (which took up five lots on Mitropoliei Street and three on Xenopol Street, where it also has an entrance), eight nearby houses had to be demolished, as well as the little Greek church built in 1797-1799 that had heretofore served as a cathedral.Gogâlea, p.18 Work, coordinated by city architect Iosif Schussnig, began in 1902 and was finished in 1904, when the copper roof was done. The plan, by Virgil Nagy and Iosif Kamner of Budapest, was chosen from among designs submitted by 31 mainly Austrian and Hungarian architects. On 13 December 1904, the four bells were blessed and placed in the two main spires (during World War I, the Austro- Hungarian Army melted the three bells in the western spire for use as cannons; these were not replaced until 1926).\\"Catedrala Ortodoxă: Strada Mitropoliei\\" The iconostasis and kliros were then manufactured at Constantin Babic's firm in Bucharest; electric lighting was also installed. The iconostasis (of gilt carved wood) and dome (showing Christ Pantocrator flanked by angels) were painted by Octavian Smigelschi, from the nearby village of Ludoș.\\"Catedrala Ortodoxă\\" The exterior is in red and yellow brick. The spacious nave is bordered by smaller spherical roofs and four towers: two smaller octagonal ones, and two larger ones near the entrance with a square base that becomes octagonal in the bell area. The ends of the towers are shaped like double bulbs, with a skylight in the centre. The main entrance is through a portico with three semicircular doors. Behind this and between the main towers is an ample semicircular vestibule with a similarly-shaped stained-glass window, while the outside is decorated with round mosaics showing Jesus and the Four Evangelists. The cathedral is 53.10m long and 25.40m wide in the centre, the dome 24.70m high (34.70m on the exterior) and 15m in diameter, while the spires are 43m high (45m including the crosses). On 30 April 1906, Metropolitan Meţianu, joined by his suffragan bishop from Arad, Ioan Papp, and a group of priests and deacons, consecrated the cathedral. Nicolae Iorga was also present; he donated a silver engolpion and a valuable icon. Since its dedication, the cathedral has undergone a number of restorations and improvements: the walls have been decorated with neo-Byzantine paintings by Iosif Keber and Anastasie Demian, and liturgical objects, vestments, books and a sound system have all been added. Divine Liturgy and Vespers take place daily, as well as other services when provided for.

He played two seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays and Baltimore Orioles.  Early life and education  Huffman played high school baseball in Texas for Brazoswood High School near his native Freeport, Texas.  Baseball career  Huffman was drafted out of high school in Texas in June 1977 by the San Francisco Giants as the team's second-round draft pick. In 1977, Huffman made 10 starts for the Great Falls Voyagers in the Pioneer Baseball League, a Class A rookie league, going 7-3. On March 15, 1978, Huffman was part of a massive trade that sent him to the Oakland Athletics, along with Dave Heaverlo, Gary Alexander, John Henry Johnson, Gary Thomasson, Alan Wirth, $300,000 (and Mario Guerrero, who was named later), in exchange for Vida Blue. Huffman began the 1978 season pitching with the Jersey City A's in the Eastern League AA league. Partway through the 1978 season, he was promoted to San Francisco's AAA Vancouver Canadians minor-league club. On August 15, 1978, Oakland traded Huffman and Willie Horton to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for Rico Carty. He was subsequently transferred to the Blue Jays' AAA Syracuse Chiefs farm club.  1979 season  Huffman made the Blue Jays' big-league roster in 1979 and remained with the team for the entire season. Overall, the season was a disappointment, as he went 6-18. He made 31 starts, posted a 5.77 earned-run average and gave up 25 home runs. On August 27, 1979, Huffman pitched what easily was his best game in his major-league career, tossing a one-hitter against the Oakland Athletics in Toronto. Huffman posted his first win at Exhibition Stadium after six losses. Huffman retired the first 11 hitters, faced only 30 batters in total, and gave up the lone hit to Jim Essian in the sixth inning. He also walked Mike Heath and Mario Guerrero. The win was Huffman's final victory as a major league pitcher. \\"It's always great to beat a club you played with,\\" Huffman said after the game. \\"I know all those guys over there. As for thinking of a no-hitter, I wasn't necessarily doing that. It's tough to pitch a no-hitter. I'm happy I got the shutout and only gave up one hit.\\" In 1980, Huffman was set to start the season with Toronto, but was optioned to the team's AAA farm club in Syracuse after manager Bobby Mattick chose to go with a four-man rotation. \\"Phil has added a changeup to his pitching and he's been one of our top workers,\\" Mattick told the Globe and Mail in April 1980. \\"But we want him to get a lot of work and he'll get it at Syracuse.\\" Huffman never ended up joining the major-league staff during the 1980 season, however. Huffman remained in the Blue Jays' system in 1981 as well, going 5-9 with a 5.69 earned run average while at Syracuse.  After Toronto  On March 25, 1982, the Blue Jays traded Huffman to the Kansas City Royals for Rance Mulliniks. Huffman was assigned to the Royals' AAA Omaha Royals minor-league farm club, where he spent the entire season. On April 2, 1983, the Royals released Huffman. On May 24, 1983, Huffman signed as a free agent with the New York Mets. He pitched for the team's Tidewater Tides AAA farm club during 1983 and 1984. On July 13, 1984, the Baltimore Orioles purchased Huffman's contract from the Mets, and he finished out the season at Baltimore's Charlotte O's AA farm club.  1985 season  In 1985, Huffman began the season with Baltimore's Rochester Red Wings AAA farm club. On July 10, 1985, Huffman was called up to the majors to fill the roster spot vacated by injured reliever Nate Snell. At the time, Huffman was 6-7 with Rochester. Huffman only appeared in two games—one on July 13, 1985 against the Chicago White Sox (in which he gave up four earned runs in one-third of an inning pitched)—in his first stint with Baltimore that year before being sent back to the minors. He then was recalled at the end of the season and pitched in just one more game, starting the October 3, 1985 second game of a doubleheader against the Boston Red Sox, being pulled from the game in the fifth inning after giving up an RBI single to future Hall of Famer Wade Boggs. For his 1985 major-league season, Huffman went 0-0 and posted a 15.43 earned run average in two games, pitching four and 2/3 innings, giving up seven hits, eight earned runs and striking out two.  Later career  On June 26, 1987, Rochester released Huffman after he went 5-6 with a 4.78 earned run average. \\"Phil is one of the older, veteran pitchers,\\" Rochester manager John Hart was quoted as telling the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle. \\"He would be a stabilizing factor on the ballclub, but we just didn't feel at this time Phil would help us out at the big-league level.\\" After his release from Rochester, Huffman joined the Minnesota Twins' Portland Beavers AAA farm club for the balance of 1987, posting a 1-2 record with a 9.37 earned run average in nine games. After 1987, Huffman stopped playing organized baseball.  Today  Huffman now lives in Rochester, New York and is the supervisor for a welding supply company that distributes high-pressured liquid oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and flammable gas.

There, on 20 June 1858, two of its officers, Lieutenants Rose and W. F. F. Waller, organized a surprise attack by night on the Gwalior Fort, their party succeeding in breaking open a number of gates and, after hand-to-hand fighting, taking the fort. Rose was killed, but for his part in the action Waller was awarded the Victoria Cross. In a despatch dated 5 September 1858, the regiment's commanding officer Lt Col. G. H. Robertson reported from a camp near Beejapoor that he had led a column of the 25th with men of other units out of Powree on 27 August in pursuit of Maun Singh, on the 29th engaged a party of Singh's infantry, and early on 5 September arrived near Beejapoor where he caught up with Singh, attacked him at 5.15 and had routed him by 7 a.m., destroying \\"at least 450 mutineers\\".

The park is set on the continuation of Rue de la Loi/Wetstraat, which starts at the end of Brussels' Park before the Royal Palace. History At the Brussels International Exposition of 1910, a section on military history was presented to the public and met with great success. Given the enthusiasm of the population, the authorities created a military museum within the international context of extreme tension which led to the Great War. The museum was originally installed on the site of La Cambre Abbey and moved to the Cinquantenaire Park in 1923. The building In 1875, the Belgian architect Gédéon Bordiau made a proposal to build flats on the site of a former parade ground of the Garde Civique. The location was named Cinquantenaire in French (literally \\"50th anniversary\\") because it was planned as an exhibition space to celebrate the half-century since Belgium's independence in 1830. Temporary structures were erected on the site for the International Exposition of 1897 as Bordiau's work had not been finished. The construction of buildings was put on hold in 1890 for lack of funds and was eventually stopped by the death of the architect in 1904. Work resumed the following year under the direction of French architect Charles Girault and was completed with a new patron, King Leopold II. The triumphal arch that had already been planned was amended and expanded to meet the wishes of the King. A fire destroyed the south wing of the building in 1946, part of the Royal Museums of Art and History. The collection pieces were saved, and the burnt wing has since been rebuilt. As for the north wing, home to the Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and Military History, it was spared. Collection The North Hall hosts the permanent aviation exhibition. The museum's collection originally consisted of approximately 900 pieces collected by the officer Louis Leconte following the Great War. Leconte collected considerable equipment abandoned by the Germans in 1918. The collection was later heavily enriched by legacies, gifts and exchanges. Important developments include the opening of the armour section (1980), the move of the armour collection from the northernmost hall (1986), and the opening of the marine section (1996). Today, the museum displays uniforms, weapons, vehicles and military equipment of all ages and all countries. Aviation hall The north wing, built by Gideon Bordiau, has been occupied by the aviation hall since 1972 when the Air and Space gallery was inaugurated. The collection includes various types of aircraft, both military and civilian, some dating back to the early 20th century, while the most recent additions include an F-16 Fighting Falcon and Westland Sea King.

There are primarily two classes of people with Igbo ancestry in the United States, those whose ancestors were taken from Igboland as a result of the transatlantic slave trade before the 20th century and those who immigrated from the 20th century onwards partly as a result of the Nigerian Civil War in the late 1960s and economic instability in Nigeria. Igbo people prior to the American Civil War were brought to the United States by force from their hinterland homes on the Bight of Biafra and shipped by Europeans to North America between the 17th and 19th centuries. Identified Igbo slaves were often described by the ethnonyms Ibo and Ebo(e), a colonial American rendering of Igbo. Some Igbo slaves were also referred to as 'bites', denoting their Bight of Biafra origin, and other names were used in reference to their home lands in Africa. Their presence in the United States was met with mixed feelings by American plantation owners because of their 'rebellious' attitudes to enslavement. Many of the enslaved Igbo people in the United States were concentrated in Virginia's lower Tidewater region and at some points in the 18th century they constituted over 30% of the enslaved black population. Igbo culture contributed to the creolised African American culture and is perhaps evident in such cultural vestiges as the Jonkonnu parades of North Carolina. Igbo Americans introduced the Igbo word okra into the English language. The recent migrant population from Nigeria settled in many of the United States' larger cities and urban centres and had come largely in search of economic opportunities in the late 20th century. Because of the realities of slavery and its erasure of African heritage and customs, most people who identify as Igbo in the United States and speak the Igbo language at home are from these families that arrived in the 20th century and forth. Since the turn of the 21st century genealogy tracing by means of DNA testing is in part revealing the Igbo ancestry of African Americans, some notable celebrities including Blair Underwood, Quincy Jones, and Nnedi Okorafor.  History = Atlantic slave trade  The Igbo were affected heavily by the Atlantic slave trade in the 18th century. Enslaved Igbo were known for being rebellious and having a high count of suicide in defiance of slavery. In the United States the Igbo were most numerous in the states of Maryland (coincidentally where there is a predominant population of recent Igbo immigrants) and Virginia, so much so that some historians have denominated colonial Virginia as “Igbo land.” With a total of 37,000 Africans that arrived in Virginia from Calabar in the 18th century, 30,000 were Igbo according to Douglas B. Chambers. The Frontier Culture Museum of Virginia estimates around 38% of captives taken to Virginia were from the Bight of Biafra. Igbo peoples constituted the majority of enslaved Africans in Maryland. Chambers has been quoted saying \\"My research suggests that perhaps 60 percent of black Americans have at least one Igbo ancestor...\\" Virginia Slave notice from Williamsburg, Virginia for a runaway \\"Ibo Negro\\" Virginia was the colony that took in the largest percentage of Igbo slaves. Researchers such as David Eltis estimate between 30—45% of the 'imported' slaves were from the Bight of Biafra, of these slaves 80% were likely Igbo. A so-called conservative estimate of the amount of Igbo taken into Virginia between 1698 and 1778 is placed at 25,000. The Igbo concentration was especially high in the Tidewater and Piedmont regions of the Virginia interior. One of the reasons for this high number of Igbo slaves in Virginia was the domination of the Bight of Biafra region of Africa by Bristol and Liverpool English merchants who frequently brought Bight of Biafra slaves to British colonies, Virginia being one of these colonies. The high concentration of Igbo slaves in Virginia was contributed to further by neighboring states. Planters in South Carolina and Georgia looked down on Igbo slaves because many were rebellious. Because of this the majority of Igbo slaves were taken and sold to Virginian planters. Some possible Igbo names were also found among slave records in Virginia. Names found in records such as Anica, or Anakey, Breechy and Juba may originate respectively from the Igbo names Nneka, meaning the mother is superior, and mburichi, male members of the Kingdom of Nri and Jiugba, meaning yam barn. Some had their ethnicity added to their names such as Eboe Sarah and plain Ebo. These hints of Igbo influence go along with cultural remnants pointing towards the Igbo presence in Virginia, one of which is the use of the Eboe drum in music. The Igbo presence in Virginia also brought new practices such as the cultivation of Okra, a plant whose name derives from the Igbo language. Slaves in Virginia relied on sweet potato which is argued by Douglas Chambers to be an indication of a substitute for yam, the Igbo staple crop. Kentucky The state of Kentucky, which was carved out of the Colony of Virginia had received many of Virginia's slave drivers and slaves as people started migrating westward. These migrations spread out the population of African slaves in America, including Igbo slaves. Here the Igbo population had already become heavily creoleized alongside other African ethnicities that were taken in significant numbers to America. Culture African cultures were heavily suppressed in the American slave era. The plantation and slave owners made sure to suppress African cultures through intimidation and torture, stripping away slaves' names and heritage. As expected, Igbo culture faced the same oppression, however some cultural remnants of Igbo origin was found and can still be found in the United States. Most of these cultural remnants can be found in music and entertainment. Igbo culture manifested in America through the Jonkonnu festivals that once took residence in the black slave population in Virginia. This masquerade bears similarity with the masking traditions of the Okonko secret society who still operate in the Igbo hinterland. The maskers wear horns which further shows similarity to Igbo culture and the Ikenga deity. Heavily African influenced American music genres such as Jazz and Ragtime stem from a mix of African cultures that creolized in the Americas. Although these genres could be described as a mix, there are elements of American music that have specific origin and Igbo instruments, such as the 'Eboe Drum'. The Igbo opi flute is similar to the drum and fife traditions. The novel Things Fall Apart by Chinua Achebe follows the story of Okonkwo, an Igbo leader and warrior. The novel alludes to many of the customs and historical happenings of post-colonial Igbo culture. The book has been critically acclaimed, often being referenced as the archetypal African novel written for the Western world. Religion The vast majority of Igbo Americans identify as Christian, with a significant amount of adherents to Roman Catholicism. Protestantism; including Anglicanism, Seventh day Adventist, Baptist, Methodist and non-denominational churches; make up the other denominations of Igbo Christians.

Igbo Landing  Igbo Landing is a historic site in Dunbar Creek of St. Simons Island, Glynn County, Georgia, United States.

He held the same office in Strasbourg 1506-10; in 1516 he is mentioned as preacher in Sélestat; later in Villingen in the Black Forest, and finally in Thann. Works Prompted by his acquaintance with Geiler of Kaisersberg, he published in 1515 \\"Das Evangelienbuch\\"; in 1516 \\"Die Emeis, Buch von der Omeissen\\"; in 1517 \\"Die Brösamlin Geilers\\"; in 1520 \\"Das Narrenschiff, aus dem Latein ins Deutsch gebracht\\". His own work, which assured him a lasting place in German literature, is the collection of farces and humorous stories \\"Schimpf (Scherz) und Ernst\\". This a genuine \\"folk book\\", written in an easy and plain style, filled with humour and pointed satire, intended to instruct while it amused. \\"He did not desire,\\" as Georg Rollenhagen says in his preface to \\"Froschmäusler\\", \\"to make people laugh without teaching them something; his book was like the old legends and sagas, full of fabulous happenings and incidents, but written so that in them, as in a comedy, there are combined with poetry and imagination the plain, unvarnished, bitter truths of life, worded so as to tell serious things in a jocular manner, with a laugh and a smile.\\" Pauli drew his information from a variety of sources, and his farces became the inspiration of the later German poets, especially for Hans Sachs. He exercised a wide influence upon the culture of the whole century.

The Mountains of Kong on a West African Map from 1839. The Mountains of Kong were a non-existent mountain range charted on maps of Africa from 1798 through to the late 1880s. The mountains were once thought to begin in West Africa near the highland source of the Niger River close to Tembakounda in Guinea, then continue east to the legendary Central African Mountains of the Moon, thought to be where the White Nile had its source.  History  In 1798 a map resulting from the explorations of the area by Mungo Park showed this west to east mountain range for the first time. It was produced by the English cartographer James Rennell who showed the Niger evaporating inland at Wangara.Garfield, Simon, On The map, Chapter 11, The Legendary Mountains of Kong, 2012, Profile Books. The German map maker Johann Reinecke included the mountains in his map of 1804 as the Geburg Kong. In 1805 the London engraver John Cary showed them for the first time linking to the Mountains of the Moon. Various nineteenth century explorers of West Africa included the range on maps they produced or directed the production of after exploring the area. These include French explorer René Caillié, who explored the highlands of Guinea at Fouta Djallon, near the source of the Niger; the Cornish explorer Richard Lemon Lander and his younger brother John; and Scottish explorer Hugh Clapperton who also sought the course of the Niger River in its upper reaches. The historians Thomas Basset and Phillip Porter have identified forty maps showing the mountains published between 1798 and 1892.Thomas J. Bassett and Philip W. Porter, “From the Best Authorities’: The Mountains of Kong in the Cartography of West Africa,” The Journal of African History 32, No. 1, 1991, 368. Despite the failure of other later explorers to locate the range, it continued to appear on maps until late in the nineteenth century. Cartographers stopped including the mountains on maps after French explorer Louis Gustave Binger established that the mountains were fictitious in his 1887–89 expedition to chart the Niger River from its mouth in the Gulf of Guinea and through Côte d'Ivoire. In 1928 Bartholemew's Oxford Advanced Atlas still contained them in its index locating them at 8° 40' N, 5° 0' W. Even later they appeared erroneously in Goode's World Atlas of 1995.

It is also a rare surviving reminder of East Street's residential past. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The William Russell House stands east of the downtown Pittsfield, in a builtup area on the north side of East Street between 2nd and 4th Streets. It is closely sandwiched by a tall government office building to its left, and the Providence Court housing complex to its right. It is a 2-1/2 story structure, with a cross-gabled roof configuration and an exterior finished in a variety of materials. Its foundation is rusticated granite, the first floor is finished in rusticated bluestone, and the second floor is finished in terra cotta tiled. The upper gable ends are finished in a combination of stucco and terra cotta tile. The porch extending along one side is decorated in marble and brownstone. The interior has very high quality woodwork and tile. The house was designed by H. Neill Wilson, and built in 1886 as a town house for William Russell Allen, a wealthy member of a locally prominent family. The house was the first major commission in the region by Wilson, who went on to a long a successful career as an architect in the county and elsewhere. The house is an early example of the Shingle style of design, influenced by the work of H.H. Richardson, which Wilson was known to have studied.

Anthony Birthplace Museum is a historic house museum at 67 East Road in Adams, Massachusetts. It is notable as the birthplace of suffragist Susan B. Anthony in 1820 and for its association with early educators and industrialists in Adams. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. The house is now a learning center and museum dedicated to showcasing Susan B. Anthony's early years. One room is dedicated to Anthony's later activist life. House architecture Built in 1817, the house is a conventional, center hall, 2.5-story colonial in the Federalist style. Twin chimneys rise from the building's center line. A modest 1.5-story ell was added onto the rear of the house, and a porch, added onto the side of the rear ell in the 1950s, was enclosed in the 1960s. A barn on the property was replaced by a modern garage, which houses the museum's gift shop. Inside the house, the original floorplan has been retained, with a central hall flanked by large public rooms in front of the house and smaller service rooms in the rear. The rear ell contains two small rooms. Most of the original woodwork has been retained, although one fireplace has been bricked up. Museum displays The museum shows Susan B. Anthony's daily family life and influences, such as her Quaker background, in the early 19th century and how the house was restored in 2006-2009 and museum consists of permanent and changing exhibits. The rooms include Kitchen and Heath, Daniel Anthony's store, the Birthing Room, the Portrait Gallery and the Legacy Room. Kitchen and Hearth depicts the main gathering space for the Anthony family and their dependents, approximately 23 girls who worked in Daniel Anthony's 26-loom mill on Tophet Brook, across East Road. Daniel Anthony's store, which Susan's father ran out of the northeast room of the family home to supply the needs of his textile workers and neighbors, has been recreated the way it may have been in 1817. The Birthing Room is where the first five of the Anthony children were born. The Portrait Gallery holds reproductions of Anthony family members and friends. The Legacy Room contains a timeline from 1820 to 1906 with the major events of Anthony's life and important world events; an artifacts collection with period pieces; and ephemera, including suffrage postcards and meeting notices, which provide insight into the issues for which early feminists advocated, such as: *Abolitionism. Anthony was raised by anti- slavery Quakers. Slavery was among the most pressing moral question of the mid-19th century, and the Civil War resulting from disputes around it, tore the nation apart. Anthony fought against slavery in her early adult years. *The Temperance movement. Anthony became deeply involved in temperance, one of the great reform movements of the 19th century. In her temperance work, she experienced the relative voicelessness of women in the political process. She began advocating for suffrage as a means to influence moral and social reforms. *Suffrage. After the Civil War, Anthony devoted her life to women's suffrage. Others continued the work after her death, and the 19th amendment was passed in 1920, giving women the right to vote. History The first of the Anthonys to arrive in Adams, Massachusetts, was David Anthony, the great- grandfather of Susan B. Anthony, in the years before the American Revolutionary War. He came as part of a more general migration of Quakers to the area from Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts. He established a cider mill that remains in the Anthony family to this day. His grandson, David Anthony, built this house in 1817 as a gift to his son, Daniel Anthony, the father of Susan B. Anthony. David was a strong proponent of education, teaching at the East Road School, and joining with others in the tightly knit Quaker community to found the Adams Academy in 1825 on land owned by his father. Daniel Anthony also continued the family interest in mills, establishing a cotton yarn-producing mill, known as the Pump Log Mill, in 1822. It is in this house that his second child, Susan B. Anthony, was born on February 15, 1820. In 1827 he was lured by financial interests to Battenville, New York. The house remained in Anthony family hands until 1895, after which it went through a succession of owners. The Society of Friends Descendants acquired the property in 1926, and established a museum. The building was returned to private hands in 1949. It underwent restoration from 2006 to 2009. It is now home to the nonprofit Susan B. Anthony Birthplace Museum, showcasing Susan B. Anthony's early years and her legacy as a tireless advocate of women's right to vote. On October 9, 2019, The Berkshire Eagle reported that Colleen Janz, the director of the museum from 2012 to 2018, was fired on July 23, 2018 for allegedly stealing $31,000 from the museum through falsified transactions. Susan B. Anthony abortion dispute One of the exhibits is about Restellism, a name for abortion that was first heard in a popular lecture, portions of which were reprinted on March 4, 1869, by editors Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Parker Pillsbury in the pages of Anthony's newspaper The Revolution. The display describes how suffragists took a stance opposing the practice of restellism, the term used at the time for abortion. It shows 122 references taken from Anthony's newspaper—mentions of Restellism which offer insight into how the women's rights activists came to oppose this practice. The owner of the museum is Carol Crossed who is a pro-life feminist. The museum's initial mission statement included \\"raising public awareness\\" of Anthony's \\"wide-ranging legacy\\" including her being \\"a pioneering feminist and suffragist as well as a noteworthy figure in the abolitionist, opposition to restellism and temperance movements of the 19th century\\" (emphasis added.) A local paper reported that the exhibit about Restellism implies that the rejection of advertisements shows Anthony's personal views about restellism, the historical term for pregnancy termination. Three opening day protesters said the museum's leadership was \\"inferring upon [Anthony] an unproven historical stance.\\" They also said that the directors were pushing a pro-life agenda. Answering this assertion, Crossed said, \\"the pro-life views expressed in Anthony's newspaper, The Revolution, will not be excluded from the exhibition.\\" See also *List of monuments and memorials to women's suffrage *National Register of Historic Places listings in Berkshire County, Massachusetts ReferencesExternal links *Susan B.

Built in 1894-95, it is a fine example of Renaissance Revival architecture, and one of the town's most architecturally sophisticated commercial buildings. It served as the local National Guard armory until 1914, and now houses commercial businesses. It was listed on the National Historic Register in 1982. Description and history The Armory Block is located in downtown Adams, on the east side of Park Street almost opposite the First Congregational Church. It is one of the four large brick buildings on Park Street along with the P. J. Barrett Block, Jones Block, and the Mausert Block. It is a three-story masonry structure, finished in yellow brick on the main facade, and red brick on the sides. The ground floor has three storefronts with recessed entries and glass display windows, with the building entrance to the right of the middle storefront in an arched surround. The upper floors are divided into three sections, with paired round-arch windows above the entrance. To its right is a slightly recessed panel with bands of three round- arch windows on each level, and on its left is a larger panel with two pairs of similar windows on each level. The building is crowned by a modillioned cornice and low parapet. The block was built in 1894 by A.J. Daniel, a developer from a locally prominent family. It was built to serve as an armory for the Massachusetts National Guard, a role it fulfilled until new facilities were built in 1914. After it was decommissioned from military use in 1914 it was converted into retail space on the first floor, office space on the second and a bowling alley on the third floor. Alterations to the Armory Block have been relatively minor and its original use, and design remains essentially unaltered since the early twentieth century.

It is a hunt game. It uses an Alquerque board, and therefore, Sher-bakar is specifically a tiger hunt game (or tiger game). There are two tigers attempting to elude and capture as many of the other player's pieces which in other hunt games in this part of the world is often referred to as a goat, cows, lamb, or men. An interesting and uncommon feature in this game is that the goats, cows, lamb, or men are piled up on four points of the board at the beginning of the game. Piling up pieces is an unusual feature in hunt games or any board game in general. The only other hunt game that uses this feature is Bagh bandi, a game closely related to Sher-bakar. Hereinforth, the white pieces will be referred to as goats.  Goal  The goats win if they surround and immobilize the two tigers. The tigers win if they capture enough goats so that they cannot immobilize the tigers.  Equipment  The board is an Alquerque board. There are 2 tigers represented as 2 black pieces. There are 19 goats represented as 19 white pieces.  Game play and rules  1\\\\. Players decide which animal to play. 2\\\\. In the beginning, one tiger is placed on the middle point of the left most column, and the other tiger is placed on the middle point of the right most column. The goats are placed on four different points. They are placed on the second and fourth point of the second left most column, and on the second and fourth point of the middle column. Three of the four points have five goats piled up, and the remaining point has four goats piled up. 3\\\\. Players alternate their turns throughout the game. Only one piece may be used to move or capture per turn. The goats start first. 4\\\\. There is no source that completely describes the movement of the goats or tigers for Sher-bakar. However, a similar game called Bagh bandi that is from Lower Bengal, India may provide us the answer. The goat player may take the top goat of a pile, and place it onto any vacant adjacent point following the pattern on the board. Or the goat player can take any single goat on the board and move it one space onto any vacant adjacent point following the pattern on the board. A goat may not move onto a pile, or onto a single goat piece to form a pile. Similarly, a tiger may be moved one space onto a vacant adjacent point following the pattern on the board. 5\\\\. A tiger can capture by the short leap as in draughts or Alquerque. The tiger leaps over the adjacent goat, and lands on a vacant point immediately beyond. The leap must be in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board. A tiger can also leap over a pile of goats, but only captures the top most goat of the pile, and lands onto a vacant point on the other side. Again, the jump must be in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board. Only one capture is allowed per turn, however, another source states that multiple captures are allowed. If multiple captures are allowed, the tiger, however, cannot jump back and forth on the same pile to capture all of its pieces in one turn. Captures are not compulsory. Goats cannot capture.

Description and history  The Armstrong House is located on a residential street on the north side of North Adams, on the east side of Brooklyn Street. It is a two-story wood frame structure, three bays wide, with a low hip roof supported by decorative brackets at the corners and studded with modillion blocks. Its main entrance is in the leftmost bay, with a portico that is also bracketed, with 20th-century columns and balustrade that are sympathetic to its Italianate style. A single-story polygonal bay projects from the right side of the main block. A two-story ell extends to the rear, connecting the house to a barn that is of the same vintage as the house, with an oculus window in its gable end. Extending across the ell's side is a bracketed shed-roof porch. The house was built in 1875, during North Adams' industrial boom time. Its combination of features are a locally distinctive variant of the Italianate style, which is found repeated elsewhere in the community. The house was built for W. W.

The original uses of the building were to provide retail shops on the ground floor and apartment-style housing above, a common feature of buildings of the period.

In 1984, after a period of abandonment, the building was rehabilitated by Dawson Associates into two commercial spaces and eight apartments of affordable housing. Financing was a blended form from an area bank, the (then) Massachusetts Government Land Bank under a pilot program to encourage changes in local tax abatement procedures to incentivize the redevelopment of abandoned properties, and the Town of Adams.

With a construction history dating to 1833, it is the oldest surviving mill building in the city, and was the first local acquisition of Sprague Electric, a major local employer in the 20th century. The mill was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The complex now houses artist studios and other facilities. Description and history Beaver Mill is located east of downtown North Adams, on the north bank of the North Branch Hoosic River, originally the source of its power. It consists of a series of large attached masonry structures, built mainly out of brick. Its main building (mill #1) is built in part on foundations that date to 1833, and its lower floors were built in 1850 out of stone following a fire. This portion is the oldest mill building in North Adams, and its only surviving stone mill structure. The mill was owned for many years by A.C. Houghton, one of the city's leading businessman and its first mayor. In 1875, Gallup & Houghton owned the majority of the mill, with about one quarter owned by Harvey Arnold. A long, high, thick wall was built along the water in 1888 to protect the mill. The mill achieved its largest extent in 1900, with 25,000 spindles, as part of the Arnold Print Works properties; business failures in 1878 and 1908 caused the mill to be part of the Arnold Print Works Reorganization Agreements. In 1929 Arnold sold the property to Sprague Electric, whose first major facility it was. Sprague moved some of its facilities from Quincy, Massachusetts, to the Beaver Mill in 1930. Sprague went on to take over most of the Arnold complex. Sprague sold it to Hoosuck Community Resources Corp. by 1977.Sprage, John L.

She died aged 27 in 1872 and is buried in Saint Maurs - Glencairn church with her parents and not with her husband. This arrangement is rather unusual and may have been a family tradition judging by the other married daughters buried here with the family. Kennox is not even in the same Parish as Craig House. Charles Somerville McAlister and Janet had four children. They bequeathed the part of the Barony of Bollingshaw named Chapelton to their younger son James, who never married and died in 1857. Charles the father died in 1847 and his eldest son, also called Charles Somerville McAlester, born in 1828 and married to Mary Brabazon, inherited the Kennox estate.

These chapel lands would have been held in mortmain until after the reformation.Aiton, William (1811). General View of the Agriculture of Ayr. Pub. Glasgow. The old cottage beyond the site of the old mill was known as Crevoch and a building of that name is placed in this area in Timothy Pont's map of 1604. Fairlie - Crevoch is situated near Cunninghamhead and a Fairlie - Crevoch Mill existed on the Annick Water near Ramstane (1860 OS), however this had been known as Scroaggy or Scroaggie Mill until after the 'Kennox' Crevoch mill fell into disuse. James Somerville obtained Chapelton, however we know from Dobie that James McAlister, nephew of the aforementioned James, was the owner in 1874. This James McAlister, the nephew of James Somerville, also never married. Chapelton had been re-acquired into the Bollingshaw Barony for him by his father, Charles McAlister.

Centered at the junction of Massachusetts Route 8 and YMCA Road, this area was the town's civic heart and a center of industry until it was eclipsed in importance by North Becket, which was served by the railroad. Most of the architecture in the district is in the Federal and Greek Revival styles popular in the late 18th to mid 19th centuries. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history Becket was first laid out by colonial settlers in the 1737, but was not settled until the 1750s, and was incorporated as a town in 1765. Its earliest civic structures include the Center Cemetery (1756) on the south side of YMCA Road, militia training and parade ground (at the junction of MA 8 and YMCA Road), the first meetinghouse (1762-64), now demolished, with the site marked north of the parade ground, and a stone animal pound (1768) on the west side of MA 8 that is the finest surviving pound in Berkshire County. The present Greek Revival First Congregational Church was built in 1850, across YMCA Road from the old meetinghouse, but the latter's 19th-century horse sheds were retained. The village's decline began after the 1841 construction of the Western Railroad bypassed it in favor of North Becket. As a result, the village retains a significant number of Federal and Greek Revival buildings, with relatively little subsequent development. The historic district is geographically centered on YMCA Road, an east-west route joining Route 8 to Hamilton Road. The district extends along the latter two roads south from their junctions with YMCA Road, and a short way north on Hamilton Road. In addition to houses and the buildings already mentioned, the district includes an old post office, old town hall, and a former schoolhouse that has been converted to a residence.

Built in 1895 by the locally prominent Plunkett family, it is an important surviving reminder of the town's industrial textile past. Now converted into mixed residential and commercial use, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The Berkshire Mill No. 1 stands just north of Adams' central business district, on a parcel bounded by Columbia and Hoosac Streets to the west and south, and a railroad right-of-way to the east. The mill consists of a large main building, 3-1/2 stories in height, built out of red brick with granite foundation and trim. Architectural detailing is limited, with windows set in segmented-arch openings and a cornice with some corbelled brickwork. The most prominent decoration is in the tower that projects from the center of the south-facing main facade, rising four stories to a hip roof. The upper level on three sides consists of a series of round- arch openings. The mill is one of the surviving remnants of the Berkshire Cotton Manufacturing Company, established in Adams in 1888 by the locally prominent Plunkett family, and one of the town's largest employers at its height. The company eventually merged several times, and is now known as Berkshire Hathaway, a company managed by Warren Buffett. The manufacturing company was originally successful despite a drop in demand for the products of other Adams mills because the Plunketts decided to focus on more fashionable fine cotton fabric. The company grew rapidly between its founding and 1900, when President William McKinley, a friend of the Plunketts, laid the cornerstone for their Number 4 Mill. This mill was built on the site of the former Adams Paper Company mill, in which the Plunketts had been leasing space. Mill No. 2 was located north of this building, where the parking lot is located. The company eventually acquired other mills by purchase, but business declined in the 20th century, and the mills changed ownership several times. Portions of them were converted to other manufacturing uses, and mills 2 and 3 were demolished due do a drop in demand for industrial space. The building was converted into 65 apartments in 1987 and is currently managed by Harvest Properties LLC. A similar proposal to convert Berkshire Mill No.4 into 150 apartments was made in 2014 but development has not started and the building remains vacant.http://www.iberkshires.com/story/47457/Developer-Details-Plans- for-Former-Adams-Mill.html See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Berkshire County, Massachusetts References Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1889 Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Massachusetts Category:National Register of Historic Places in Berkshire County, Massachusetts Category:Berkshire Hathaway Category:Adams, Massachusetts ","title":"Berkshire Mill No. 1"},{"id":"18706150","text":"Berkshire Life Insurance Company Building is a historic commercial building at 5-7 North Street in Pittsfield, Massachusetts.

The Bidwell House  The house was built in the 1760s by the Reverend Adonijah Bidwell, the first minister in what was then Township No. 1. At that time, the house was the demographic center of the township and was located on the route of the Boston-Albany Post Road. It is a classic Georgian Saltbox built around a central chimney. Four fireplaces and two beehive ovens feed into the chimney structure, which is supported by a classical Roman Arch in the basement. The house has two additions, the Ell Addition (1820s) and a Greek Revival/Carriage Barn addition (1840s). History =Henry Knox Reverend Bidwell, a patriot, was an active supporter of the United States Army. Henry Knox, famous for his leadership of the expedition that carried strategically crucial cannons from Fort Ticonderoga to Dorchester Heights, passed through Monterey on that famous mission, most likely on the post road. Historical evidence suggests that Knox may have passed through the Bidwell property on his famous journey, now the basis for books, films, and the historic Henry Knox Trail. He may have even stopped at the house in the middle of winter, possibly to stay a night or obtain supplies. Ownership The Reverend died in 1784 and left the house to his son, Adonijah the Younger. Adonijah the Younger utilized the house and grounds (approximately at the time) as a family farm, before selling the house in his old age to his son, John Devotion Bidwell, for \\"love and affection and one dollar.\\" In 1853, John Devotion Bidwell sold the house to the Carrington family after 103 years of Bidwell ownership. At the time, John Bidwell was a selectman, justice of the peace, and prominent personality in the newly incorporated town of Monterey, Massachusetts (1847). The house remained with the Carrington family for three generations and 61 years until they sold it to a lumber company in 1914. After using the house as a base for local operations, the company sold it to an Art School. It was used as a faculty house by the school until 1935. By this time it had acquired the name \\"Deepwood Manse.\\" By the 1950s, the house was in an increasing state of disrepair. Restoration In 1960, it was purchased by Jack Hargis and David Brush, two fashion designers from New York City. They bought it and surrounding for the sum of $30,000 and proceeded to spend the next 25 years restoring the house. They were fortunate enough to come across the inventory of the Rev. Bidwell's estate, which listed all his worldly possessions at the time of his death. Hargis and Brush proceeded to fill the restored house with dated pieces of furniture, artwork, and other objects, many of them originally owned by the Reverend.  Today  It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. In 1990, the house became a museum, the result of a death request by David Brush. It is open for tours from Thursday through Monday between Memorial Day and Columbus Day, as well as for special events. It is open from 11:00 AM to 4:00 PM, with guided tours of the house starting on the hour.

It is the only known surviving in situ bridge of its type, one of about two dozen built in western New England. It is located on an abandoned stretch of Windsor Bush Road which crosses Phelps Brook in what is now a remote upland section of Windsor. The bridge was located near farms owned by the Coleman family, giving the bridge its name. The bridge type was invented by Charles H. Ball, an entrepreneur from nearby Peru who developed the idea of using pipes as structural elements of bridges over smaller bodies of water. Only three instances are known to exist, two of which were (as of 2000) disassembled and in storage. Detail of bridge; note beaver dam underneath structure The bridge was probably built in the 1890s, when Ball was at his height as a bridge builder, and did regular work for the Windsor highway department. The bridge elements were manufactured in Ball's small East Windsor shop. It was built on the site where there had previously been a wooden bridge, and spans . The top cords of the pony truss are pipes in diameter, with doubled iron rods functioning as the truss's bottom chord. The bridge originally had wooden stringers, which were at some point replaced by iron ones. The wooden floor of the bridge is also a replacement. The bridge is accessible on foot, but is impacted by the construction of beaver dams nearby and underneath the structure. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000.

The district, centered on Main Street west of the town civic center, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005. Description and history Papermaking began as an industry in Dalton in the early 19th century, and was dominated by Zenas Crane's operations by the early 1820s. Crane and Company controlled numerous papermaking operations throughout the Berkshires, but it was headquartered in Dalton, where the Crane family lived. The family built several large estates on the north side of Main Street, notably Sugar Hill, the home of Winthrop Murray Crane, who oversaw the company's success in the late 19th century, and served as Governor of Massachusetts. The company's historic industrial facilities of Crane are located south of Main Street, although they are generally near the Housatonic River and screened from view. Prominent on the street in this area is the 1816 home of Zenas Crane, who founded the business in Dalton in the early 19th century. The most notable of the industrial facilities is the National Historic Landmark Crane and Company Old Stone Mill Rag Room, the oldest surviving building on the Crane premises. Extending east along Main Street from the industrial complex are a number of late 19th century houses, most of which were built by or for executives of the Crane company. Southwest along South Street, extending along Crane and Porter Avenues on the south side of the river, are groups of company-built worker housing. These are primarily identical duplexes built in the 1910s and 1920s. Another cluster of worker housing lies north east of the Crane family estates off Park Avenue; this area also includes a series of modest Capes built by the Cranes for World War II veterans in the early 1950s.

It is one a small number of houses in North Adams built in a transitional Federalist-Greek Revival style, and one of its relatively small number of early 19th-century houses. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Crowley House is located in the West End of North Adams on the north side of Main Street (Massachusetts Route 2), just east of Fairgrounds Avenue. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof and two interior end chimneys. The main block is flanked by single-story wings, the left one a single bay wide, and the right one three bays wide. The house follows a fairly typical Greek Revival plan, with a central hall and wings on either side of the main block. The front facade has Greek Revival details, including Doric pilasters and Greek fret molding, but the workmanship of some of the details shows that it was probably done by someone with more practice in the Federal style. The fan in the front gable end is a Federal period feature. Little is known of its early history; based on its architecture, a construction date of 1830 is estimated. It first enters the documentary record in the 1860s when its owner defaulted on debts and lost the property. It was occupied from the 1880s into the early 20th century by David Crowley, a clothes finisher working in the local textile mills. It is unknown if Crowley occupied the property, and it appears to have had long use as a rental.

Description and history The Philip Eames House is located in rural eastern Washington, at the southwest corner of Summit Hill Road and Stone House Road. It is a 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of irregularly cut granite, with a gabled roof and brick chimneys. Its main facade is five bays wide, with its center entrance set in a segmented-arch opening framed by pilasters and a keystoned arch.

The house was built in 1843, and is characterized in its National Register nomination as the town's \\"most imposing 19th century residence\\". Local lore says that some of the building materials came from the construction of the nearby railroad line, whose 1838 construction required blasting a deep cut through solid rock. Philip Eames, for whom the house was built, was the local operator of a number of saw mills. The Eames family's 1764 homestead, where he was born, stood nearby until the early 20th century.

It extends from Schenectady to Waterford by way of a series of local, county, and state highways along the Mohawk River and the Erie Canal. The byway is intended to showcase the history of the waterway, from Native American times through the creation of the Erie Canal and the role the waterside communities played in the Industrial Revolution and the westward expansion of the United States. At its east end, the byway connects to the Lakes to Locks Passage, an All-American Road. Route description The Mohawk Towpath Scenic Byway extends for from downtown Schenectady to the village of Waterford by way of a series of highways running alongside the Mohawk River. It begins at the intersection of Erie Boulevard and State Street (New York State Route 5 or NY 5) in Schenectady and follows Erie Boulevard and Maxon Road out of the city. Now in the town of Niskayuna, the byway runs alongside the Mohawk River as it follows County Route 10 (CR 10) northeast to a junction with NY 146 in the hamlet of Aqueduct. CR 10 ends here; however, the Mohawk Towpath Scenic Byway turns north to cross the Mohawk River and enter Saratoga County by way of NY 146. On the opposite riverbank, the byway leaves the state route at a junction with CR 88 and CR 91 in the town of Clifton Park. It follows the latter road to the southeast, taking on the name Riverview Road as it runs adjacent to the Mohawk River. This section of the Mohawk Towpath Scenic Byway was once part of NY 146B, a now-defunct spur route of NY 146. CR 91 leaves Riverview Road at Grooms Road; however, the byway continues southeastward along the now town- maintained road. Riverview Road continues to parallel the Mohawk River into the town of Halfmoon, where Riverview Road ends at an intersection with Clam Steam Road just east of Interstate 87\\\\. The byway briefly heads south from here on Clam Steam Road before turning back to the northeast on Canal Road. Canal Road ultimately brings the scenic byway to the hamlet of Crescent, where it intersects U.S. Route 9 (US 9). At this point, the byway splits into two branches, with each branch following a specific side of the Mohawk River. The main byway follows the south branch, which heads south from Crescent along US 9 and immediately crosses the Mohawk River on the Crescent Bridge to reach Albany County. On the south side of the riverbank in the town of Colonie, the byway splits from US 9 and proceeds southeast along Cohoes Crescent Road, a local road running alongside the waterway. It soon crosses into the city of Cohoes, becoming North Mohawk Street in the process. The byway continues along North Mohawk and New Cortland streets to Saratoga Street (NY 32), where it turns north to follow NY 32 back into Saratoga County and the village of Waterford. The north branch of the byway heads east from Crescent, loosely following the riverbank as it proceeds along CR 99 to the hamlet of Halfmoon. CR 99 ends here, giving way to CR 94; however, CR 94 terminates just a quarter-mile (0.4 km) to the east at an intersection with CR 96\\\\. This road brings the byway into the town of Waterford, but it is CR 97 that carries the byway into the village of Waterford. The latter portion serves Lock Six State Canal Park and runs in close proximity to the Erie Canal, here separate from the Mohawk River. Within the village, the byway follows Washington Avenue and Sixth Street to reach NY 32 and the byway's south branch at Broad Street. The unified byway follows NY 32 east from Sixth Street to its junction with US 4 at Third Street. The intersection is the east end of the Mohawk Towpath Scenic Byway and the south end of the Lakes to Locks Passage, an All-American Road connecting Waterford to Rouses Point by way of the Hudson River and Lake Champlain corridors. History The Mohawk Towpath Scenic Byway was created as the result of a grassroots effort to showcase to the Capital District's portion of the Mohawk River corridor. The byway was designated a New York State Scenic Byway in July 2003, and named a National Scenic Byway in September 2005. The word \\"Mohawk\\" in the byway's name is derived from the Mohawk River, and by extension the Mohawk people who originally inhabited the area. The word \\"Towpath\\" comes from a period of the Erie Canal's history when canal vessels moved principally by draft animals—mostly mules—that pulled craft from the path atop the side berm of the canal.

The most prominent parts of Stockbridge lie within the Main Street Historic District, which abuts this district to the north. The southern boundary of this district is the railroad tracks that run parallel to the Housatonic River. The eastern boundary of the district is Laurel Hill, a wooded park overlooking the town, and the western boundary is a terraced shelf in the plains of the river. The district includes properties on Depot, Elm, Maple, and South Streets, and Laurel Lane. Unlike Main Street, this district consists of more densely place residences, and narrower roads containing businesses just off Main Street. Its buildings were mostly constructed during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and partially reflect Elm Street's function as an industrial part of the town. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Stockbridge was founded in the 1730s as a \\"Praying Indian\\" community, with its main settlement where the downtown area is now. South Street began as a Native American trail leading to the south, crossing the river at a fordable location. A bridge was first built near where the modern bridge now stands in 1744. The junction of Main and South Streets became a major local commercial nexus by later in the 18th century, with the area closer to the river where small industries began to flourish. One of Berkshire County's first printing operations was begun in this area, and there was by the mid-19th century a blacksmithy. A few houses stood in the area by the turn of the 19th century, but it was not until the 1850s that a significant number of houses began to be built south of Main Street. Many of these were populated by people engaged in trades for travelers, or otherwise engaged in business on Main Street. One of the older houses and the largest in the district, the Tidmarsh-Edwards House at 8 South Street, has had a number of notable residents, including politician and businessman John Z. Goodrich.

The main village area is centered on Lanesborough Road in southern Cheshire, near Farnams and Quarry Roads, with quarry sites on the hillside to the west. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history Farnams Village is located in southern Cheshire, a rural town on the eastern slope of Mount Greylock in western Massachusetts. The geology of southwestern Cheshire includes ridges of outcrops with deposits of limestone and marble, which were mined on a small scale, primarily for local use by farmers, beginning in the early 19th century. The arrival of railroad infrastructure in the area in the mid-19th century prompted a more organized expansion of mining efforts. The Dean family were one of the first to establish a small mining operation (c. 1840), located roughly at the western end of Quarry Road. Brothers Alfred and Albert Farnam in 1874 opened a lime processing facility, and greatly expanded mining in an area adjacent to the small Dean mine. The Farnams were economically successful, producing a high quality white plaster lime, and eventually expanded their holdings to more than .

It is centered at the junction of Cold Spring, Green River, New Ashford. The junction has been a prominent center in the area since 1760. Prominent buildings in the district include the South Center School, the Store at Five Corners, and the Second Congregational Church. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history Williamstown was laid out as a township in 1739 and incorporated in 1765. Its early development was centered in the modern town center to the north, and the southern part of the town was not laid out until 1765. South Williamstown, now Five Corners, was formed out of the junction of four large parcels of land, and developed in the late 18th century as a stop on the main north-south stagecoach route (today United States Route 7). By the turn of the 19th century the village had a tavern, store, and cemetery, and the first church was built in 1808. The area remained agricultural through the 19th-century, having been bypassed by railroad construction and significant industrial activity. The district consists of about of land, centered on the junction of Route 7, Massachusetts Route 43, and Sloan Road, a local road serving the area west of the village. The area's slow pace of development and relative isolation has resulted in the accumulation of an architecturally diverse set of buildings, most of which are residential. Many of them are vernacular interpretations of popular 19th-century styles, with versions of the Federal and Greek Revival periods predominant. Significant non-residential buildings include the Second Congregational Church, a Gothic Revival structure built in 1875, the Sloan Tavern, built c. 1770 and later restyled in the Greek Revival, and the 1868 South Center School.

The housing stock in the district includes single- and multiple-family homes, built in a variety of architectural styles. There are only a small number of houses that were built before the boom of the late 19th century, most of which are in a Greek Revival style. Most of the housing in the district was built between 1887 and 1894. Eagle Street, which forms the district's eastern boundary, is a historic road leading north from the city center, and its west side is where some of the district's oldest buildings are found. The Haynes House at 175 Eagle Street was built about 1840, and is one of the largest and most architecturally sophisticated houses in the district. Nearby are two Italianate houses, one of which is a late example of the style (built 1889).

The 1905 power house, built for the Monument Mills, was the one of the first places in the United States where electricity was generated for the purpose of providing power to an industrial facility. The station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The facility has been rehabilitated and converted into modernized hydroelectric power generation plant. Description and history The Glendale Power House is located southwest of Stockbridge's village center, sandwiched between Massachusetts Route 183 on the northwest bank of the Housatonic River, below the point where Glendale Middle Road crosses the river. The property is over in size, with a dam at the northern end (just south of the bridge), a power canal in length, and a stone power house. The dam is in height, and is built out of poured concrete. The canal is wide, and was dug out of heavy clay. The power house is a single-story stone structure, three bays wide and four long, with a slate roof. The interior is a single large chamber, which historically house turbines and electrical control equipment. A sliding gantry-style crane provided the means to move equipment around within the building for maintenance. The power plant was built in 1905 by Monument Mills of Housatonic, at the site of a dam that dated to the 1840s for a papermaking operation. The stone building uses stone originally quarried for the Glendale Woolen Mill. By 1909, this plant was providing half of the mills' power requirements. The power station was taken out of service in 1946, and most of its original generation equipment removed. The property was redeveloped to provide hydroelectrict power to the main grid in the 1980s. Its four turbines can produce 1.07 MW of electricity.Enel Green Power North America website, http://www.enelgreenpower.com/en- GB/ena/power_plants/ne/glendale/ accessed 2014-10-03.

It is a lenticular pony truss bridge built c. 1885 by the Berlin Iron Bridge Company, and is the state's oldest surviving bridge of this type. It is one of only five Berlin Co. bridges in the Berkshires, and is the only known surviving bridge to implement modifications to the pony truss design patented by William O. Douglas in 1885. The bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Description and history The Golden Hill Bridge is located in a rural setting in northern Lee, carrying Golden Hill Road, a local through street, across the Housatonic River in an east-west orientation. It is a single-span iron lenticular pony truss structure, long and wide, resting on concrete abutments. The truss depth at the center of the span is . The bridge deck consists of modern steel I-beam stringers supporting a concrete road surface. A bridge has been documented to stand at this location as early as the 1790s. A bridge at the site underwent repairs in 1866, but was judged to be in need of repair or replacement in 1885. The town contracted for the trusses with the Berlin Iron Bridge Company, then a major producer of bridge trusses, and the bridge was completed for $1,000. In 1965, the state added a metal grid deck, and in 1970 it replaced the original deck supports with I-beams. In 1992, after the bridge was closed to vehicular traffic, the state began proceedings to consider replacement of the aging structure. It was further closed to pedestrians in 1996. The bridge finally underwent major restorative work in 2005, and is again open to traffic.

Built c. 1792, the house is one of the best examples of late-Georgian early-Federalist houses in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. The property's importance is further enhance by its association with a number of high-profile owners. History The first significant owner of the Goodwood property in Richmond, Massachusetts was one Jeremiah Pierson, who acquired the property in 1792, and sold it, with a house and outbuildings on it, five years later. In 1820 it came into the hands of Reverened Edwin Welles Dwight, a distant relative of Yale College president Timothy Dwight. Dwight was for eighteen years minister at the local Congregational Church, and was also notable in the foreign missionary movement, writing an account of a South Sea islander named Henry Obookiah. Dwight's memoir of Obookiah's life sparked the first missionary expedition to the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii). In 1838 Dwight sold the property to geologist Stephen Reed. He gained international exposure for his descriptions of the Richmond Boulder Train, a series of glacial erratics in Richmond and neighboring New York State. His accounts and presentations sparked a long- running debate in the geological community on the subject of glaciation. Reed sold the property in 1850, and it went through a success of owners. The purchaser in 1896, Mrs. Henry March, gave the property the name \\"Goodwood\\", after Goodwood House, the seat of the Dukes of Richmond. Richmond was named for the third duke, who supported American independence in the late 18th century. In 1933 Goodwood was purchased by Raymond Leslie Buell, an influential diplomat, and onetime editor of Fortune magazine. In 1982, the house was owned by a descendant of both Buell and Reverend Dwight. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description Goodwood is a four-square two story wood frame house that incorporates both late Georgian and early Federalist features. The main feature of the front is the entry porch, featuring sidelights, Palladian windows, and a semi-circular gable window. The interior of the house is well preserved, consisting of a central hall plan with two interior chimneys. The original kitchen, the room to the back and right of the hall, retains its original cooking fireplace, but has been converted to a library, housing Dr. Buell's 2,000 volume collection. The two front drawing rooms are both elaborately decorated.

A row of six apartment units, it was built in about 1850, and is a rare surviving example of worker housing dating to the early period of North Adams' industrial development. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Hathaway Tenement is located just northwest of central North Adams, on the north side of River Street just west of its junction with Loftus Street. It is a long two-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. It consists of six rowhouses, each three bays wide, with entrances set in pairs under gable-roofed porches. Windows are one-over-one sash, with most set singly in rectangular openings. In one of the central units, one bay of windows has been sided over. The styling is basically a vernacular Greek Revival, with flat cornerboards and short returns on the building's gable ends. The building dates to the first period of industrialization in North Adams: River Street was laid out in 1836, and over the next decade, ten mills were built along the opposite banks of the Hoosac River. The building is named for Nathaniel Hathaway, one of the mill proprietors, and is one of two identical buildings that are among the worker housing units they built. (The other building originally stood next door, was extensively altered in the 20th century, and has subsequently been demolished.) When Hathaway retired from the mill partnership, he and his wife occupied one of the units in this building. It was later owned by another mill proprietor, T.F.

It was listed on the National Historic Register in 1988. Description and history The former Hoosac Street School stands in a mixed residential and commercial area east of Adams' downtown area, at the northeast corner of Hoosac and North Hoosac Streets. It is a two-story brick structure with a hip roof topped by a cupola. The main facade is divided into three sections, the center one, which contains the entrance, projecting slightly. The flanking sections have pairs of sash windows on each level; the center section has the entrance, flanked by small windows and sheltered by a small gabled portico, on the first level, and a double window topped by an elliptical window flanked by narrow windows of equal height on the second. The school was built in 1887, when Adams was experiencing burgeoning growth due to the growth of its industrial capacity. In addition to general population growth occasioned by the improved economy, the need for additional schools was prompted by state requirements mandating education for children to the age of sixteen. Along with several other schools of the period that have survived, it was built in a Queen Anne/Stick style. It was designed by Charles Rathbun of Pittsfield, and completed at a cost of $20,000.

The school was built in 1894 from locally quarried marble. It is named for Alexander Hyde, who established the town's first school in his house on West Park Street, and was built on the site of the town's first public school. History The town of Lee, Massachusetts was incorporated in 1777, and quickly became known as a center of the papermaking industry. Marble quarried in the area achieved a reputation for strength and quality in the 19th century, seeing use in a number of high-profile buildings, including the United States Capitol and the Massachusetts State House. The town's first secondary school was established by Alexander Hyde, son of its first minister, in his house on West Park Street. Townspeople not long thereafter banded together to form the private Lee Academy on a parcel of land above the town center. Lee Academy was gradually transferred to town ownership, and became its public grammar school. It was destroyed by fire in February 1894. The town had the new Hyde School constructed on the original site of Lee Academy in 1895; it was dedicated to Alexander Hyde. It was designed by James Bryning and constructed of locally quarried marble, a response to several high-profile fires in the town, at a cost of $30,000. It served as the town's high school until 1916, when Rice High School was built. It then served as an elementary school until 2003, when it was taken out of academic service. The building was enlarged by an addition in 1936 that added a library and gymnasium, and again in 1977 when the Rice School was demolished. The building is now known as Crossway Village, and includes a senior housing complex and senior center. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description The school sits on an irregular parcel of land on a rise above Main Street in Lee. The original 1895 building is sited at the end of Academy Street, and the 20th-century additions, located to its south and east, do not intrude on the view. The three story building was built in a cross-shaped plan, with a seven bay core section, and wings three bays wide. A four-story tower rises above the center of the front facade. The exterior wall and trim work is all of local marble. The original slate roof was replaced in 1994 with asphalt shingles, at which time the building was also equipped with gutters and downspouts. At the time of its National Register nomination, the exterior marble had never required maintenance. Inside the main building, each floor had six classrooms, and the layout remains fairly intact. The classrooms retained their blackboards and much of the original woodwork. The original floors were covered by vinyl tiling. In the front entry, one of the two stairs was removed to comply with modern fire codes, but the other retains its original woodwork. In 1936 a two-story addition was added to the southeast corner of the building. This addition, built with a steel frame, housed classrooms on both levels, and a gymnasium/auditorium complex. This construction was faced with Lee marble and trimmed with Indiana limestone in a style sympathetic to that of the main building. A corridor connecting the two sections was added in 1976, when fire code necessitated the removal of some wooden stairs from the main building. A modern 1977 classroom addition further extended the 1936 addition.

The complex was demolished in 2007. Description and history The Johnson Manufacturing Company complex was located west of downtown North Adams, on a parcel of bounded on the east by Brown Street, the north by the Hoosac River (which initially provided the mill's power), and the south by railroad tracks. The complex included a main three-story mill building built in 1872, to which a number of smaller buildings were built on in the following decades. Most of the buildings exhibited modest Italianate styling typical of late 19th century mill construction. At the front of the complex stood a 1-1/2 story office building, built about 1880 to a design by Marcus F. Cummings, a prominent mill designer from Troy, New York. The Johnson Manufacturing Company was founded in 1850 by Sylvander Johnson, Nathaniel G. Hathaway, George W. Bly, and Peter Blackinton. The company acquired an existing print shop on this site, and produced cotton textiles until 1871, when it was destroyed by fire. They then built the main mill, consolidating operations from other sites in North Adams, and modernizing its technology. The company produced textiles here until 1937, when it was sold to the Sprague Electric Company. Sprague produced gas masks on the site during World War II, and then converted it to the production of specialized materials used in electrical capacitors. Industrial toxic wastes dumped at the site during this period resulted in a contaminated groundwater plume, necessitating the demolition of nearby houses. The site was shuttered in 2001, its last occupant having been Commonwealth Sprague. The property underwent remediation to deal with the toxic legacy, and the buildings were demolished in 2007.

Description and history The Jones Block is located in the town center of Adams, on the east side of Park Street north of town hall. It is a three-story brick structure, topped by a flat roof, with a decorative band and dentil molding at the roof line. The ground floor consists of two storefronts, framed by cast iron paneled columns, on either side of a central building entrance. Second and third floor windows are set in round-arch openings, those on the second story with sandstone keystones. It is one of the four brick buildings on Park Street, along with the P. J. Barrett Block, Armory Block, and the Mausert Block. The block was built in 1895 for Albert Jones, a clerk in a local clothing retailer. Originally two stories in height, it housed that store on the ground floor, and the local Hibernian Hall on the second floor. The third floor was added in the early 20th century, using matching materials and styling to the original construction, and replicating its original cornice.

It was built by Henry Sherrill, one of Richmond's early settlers, and is a fine example of transitional Georgian-Federalist architecture. The house has retained much of its historic integrity despite significant renovation and modernization in the 20th century. History Kenmore, a two-story five bay wood frame house, was built c. 1792 for Henry Sherrill, an American Revolutionary War soldier who was first exposed to the area as a refugee from Long Island, which was under British occupation during the war. Sherrill became a merchant, operating a store in town. Sherrill's success in business is shown by the size of the house and the quality of its workmanship, which are locally rivalled only by Goodwood, built by Sherrill's builder Jerimiah Peirson around the same time. Sherrill's daughter married eventual Goodwood owner, the Rev. Edwin Welles Dwight. Owners or occupants of the house during the 19th century include Selden Jennings, the local physician, and Jared Reid, Jr., principal of a Stockbridge school; Reid was married to Henry Sherrill's granddaughter. The Reids operated a successful boarding school on the property, and were responsible for naming the property \\"Kenmore\\". The Reids expanded their offerings in the 1880s to include summer art school at the urging of their son Robert. Sessions were coordinated by Frederic Crowninshield, and students included Daniel Chester French, Newton Mackintosh, and their son Robert, who later gained notice as a painter. In 1931 the property was acquired by Richard Harrison, a successful New York businessman, as a summer house. He had the house plumbing and electrical systems upgraded, and had a guest house and chicken coop built on the property. He also hired New York landscape designer Noel Chamberlain to oversee the landscaping of the property. Harrison's modifications to the house are notable for their sensitivity in preserving the integrity of the early Federal and Georgian details in the house, resulting in a blending of original details and later Colonial Revival designs. The property was sold by the Harrison estate in 1938 to Reverend E. Pomeroy Cutler. Cutler operated the property as a boarding house, at which time it came to be used by a number of high-profile musical tenants associated with nearby Tanglewood, which began operations in 1937. This use continues to this day under its current owners. Notable residents and visitors to the house have included Leonard Bernstein, Aaron Copland, Lukas Foss, Gunther Schuller, and Olga Naumova Koussevitsky, widow of conductor Serge Koussevitsky. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Kenmore was purchased in January 2018 By fashion designer Frank Muytjens and Artist and entrepreneur Scott Edward Cole. After an extensive restoration to the historic property, Kenmore has been transformed into a bespoke luxury inn, The Inn at Kenmore Hall.

Built in 1802-03 as a private academy, it was the first secondary school to open in Berkshire County. It was subsequently used as the town's high school, and now houses offices. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Description and history The former Lenox Academy building stands on the western edge of the commercial center of Lenox, on the west side of Main Street between Sunset and Cliffwood Streets. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a hip roof and clapboarded exterior. The hip roof is truncated and topped at the center by a two-stage belfry. The main facade is five bays wide, with sash windows in the outer bays. The center bay has the main entrance on the ground floor, flanked by wide sidelight windows, with pilasters between windows and door, and on the outside of the entry surround. The pilasters rise to an entablature and projecting cornice with a gable peak at the center. Above the entrance is a Palladian window, its side windows also articulated by pilasters and crowned by a corniced entablature. The Federal style building was constructed in 1803 and the school incorporated the same year. The structure house a private academy until 1866. It served as the town's public high school from 1869 to 1879, at which time it was closed for repairs and renovations. In 1888 it again began to serve as the high school, a role it fulfilled until 1908. A private school, the Trinity School, used the property from 1911 until the 1920s, when that school failed. The building then sat vacant and deteriorated, until the defunct academy, under threat of demolition, was turned over to the town for preservation. It now serves as an office building for local civic groups.

Cameron Elementary School, is a historic school building at 109 Housatonic Street in Lenox, Massachusetts. The building was constructed in 1908, and housed the town's high school until 1966, when Lenox Memorial High School opened. The building had been converted into an assisted living facility, and then converted again in 2017 into low- income-housing apartments for seniors - now known as Lenox Schoolhouse Apartments. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. Description and history The Old Lenox High School building is located east of downtown Lenox, on the north side of Housatonic Street at its western junction with High Street. It is a 2-1/2 story masonry structure, built out of red brick with terra cotta trim. It is a basically T-shaped building, with the top of the T serving as the main facade. It consists of a central horizontal main section, with flanking wings that project slightly, from which a long addition extends to the rear. The main entrance is at the center, sheltered by a rectangular portico with paired Doric columns and set recessed in a round-arch opening. Above the entrance is a tall three-part window, and the bay is crowned by a gable. The school was built in 1908 to a design by Jonathon William Donohue of Springfield, and is a good local example of large-scale Colonial Revival architecture. The school replaced the former Lenox Academy building, which had served as the town's public high school since 1869 (and as a private high school since the academy's founding in 1803). This building underwent major renovations and additions in the 1940s and 1960s. The building was then used as school facilities for grades 4 through 6 until the 1970s, when (known as the Cameron School) it began to serve grades 2 through 5. The school was closed in 1998. After three years of vacancy, the building was repurposed for use as an assisted living facility. In 2017, the building was renovated into a 38-unit apartment community for seniors.

Built in 1902, it served as the town's railroad station, on a line of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, until 1970. Now home to the Berkshire Scenic Railway Museum, it serves as a stop on the heritage railroad service provided by the museum. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The former Lenox Railroad Station is located in eastern Lenox, at the northeast corner of Housatonic Road and Willow Creek Road. The railroad tracks run between the station and Woods Pond, a wide bulge in the Housatonic River. The station itself is 1-1/2 stories in height, with attached covered passenger shelters extending along the platform to the north and south. The station is Tudor Revival in style, with a stucco and false half-timbered exterior. The station was built in 1902 by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad (or New Haven Railroad), replacing the one that had been built around 1850 by the Stockbridge & Pittsfield Railroad and which had burned to the ground the previous year. It is architecturally unusual in the region, where the Tudor Revival was not commonly seen in railroad station architecture. The station and line were acquired by the Housatonic Railroad, which became the Berkshire Division of the New Haven Railroad in 1892. The line had among places, stops at Great Barrington Station, Stockbridge, and Lee Station. It terminated in Pittsfield at Pittsfield Depot, and later, Union Station. From 1937 the Tanglewood hosted summer music events five miles to the west of the station. In peak mid-20th century years of passenger service, the Berkshire, Housatonic, Litchfield, Mahaiwe, Mahkeenac, Taconic, Umpachanee, and unnamed trains on the New Haven's Berkshire Division made stops at the station on trips between New York City and Pittsfield.New Haven Timetable, April 24, 1955, Table 11 https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:New_Haven_Railroad_1955_timetable.pdf The station went out of full year service in 1958; thereafter, trains made stops at the station only from May 26 to October 26.'Official Guide of the Railways,' April 1959, New Haven Railroad section, Table 12'Official Guide of the Railways,' June 1961, New Haven Railroad section, Table 12'Official Guide of the Railways,' June 1968, New Haven Railroad section, Table 12 The last summer of passenger service was 1970, prior to Amtrak's assuming the Penn Central's operation of intercity trains on May 1, 1971.

The district encompasses four homesteads built between 1765 and 1803, including the town's oldest house. The houses are clustered along a stretch of Washington Mountain Road near the town line with Becket, and represent one of its first places of settlement. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history Land grants in the area that is now the town of Washington were first made in 1763. One of the first ten grants was made to William Milliken, who built the house at 1796 Washington Mountain Road not long afterward. Between then and the early 19th century, Milliken was joined by three other settlers in the immediate area, which is set on a terrace on the southeastern slope of Washington Mountain (elevation ). This dispersed rural development was typical of the region in the period, but has in many instances been lost due to infill development. In this area, the soil was never very good for agriculture, and the properties changed hands numerous times. The area also lacked resources for industrial development, and was bypassed by the railroads, all of which were factors that effectively precluded later development. The district extends along Washington Mountain Road, north from the town line with Becket. Its principal surviving built resources are four houses, of which the Milliken house is the only one that predates American independence. The other three were built in the late 18th or early 19th century, and are examples of vernacular Federal period architecture. All are of wood-frame construction, with clapboarded exteriors; one is 1-1/2 stories in height, while the other three are 2-1/2 stories. There is also a 19th- century barn associated with one of the houses.

The downtown portion of Main Street is widely recognizable due to its use by Norman Rockwell in his 1967 painting, Main Street, Stockbridge at Christmas. The central portion of Main Street is a broad street with wide green lawns, anchored by a traditional New England town center containing a church and municipal buildings. Along this part of Main Street is the Mission House, a National Historic Landmark that is one of oldest buildings in Stockbridge, dating to the early 1740s. Further to the west the road is more rural, and the district's western boundary is at the crossing of Main Street over the Housatonic River. The eastern part of the district includes the retail heart of the town, including the Red Lion Inn and several blocks of shops. The far eastern part of the district is Laurel Hill, a wooded park with views of the town center. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. The Stockbridge area has a significant prehistory of Native American use, with archaeological evidence of human use on at least a seasonal basis dating back for centuries. In the early 18th century it was settled by Mahican Indians who had been driven from the Hudson River area by conflict with the Mohawks. These uses included the establishment of a Native burying ground, which is within the bounds of this district. In 1734, the Province of Massachusetts Bay founded a \\"Praying Indian\\" community, with its main settlement where the downtown area is now. The arrival of English squatters and conflicts over land usage patterns led to the Natives eventually losing control of the community. The area's colonial settlement accelerated after the end of the French and Indian War in 1763. The Red Lion Inn opened in 1775, and it flourished in the early 19th century as a crossroads community not far from the county seat at Lenox.

It is operated by the Lehigh County Agricultural Society. It is one of the oldest fairs in the United States, and one of the largest in the state of Pennsylvania. The fair was first held in 1852 to showcase agricultural advancements and to entertain patrons. It has since evolved to appeal to a broader audience, adding more entertainment and dining options. Although it stays true to its agricultural roots by offering petting zoos, livestock judging contests, and a farmer's market, the modern-day fair focuses more on entertainment; it boasts a carnival, talent shows, and concerts. History=Early history of the Allentown Fair The Lehigh County Agricultural Society held the first fair from October 6 to October 8, 1852, on Livingston's Lawn, a plot located east of Fourth Street, between Walnut and Union Streets, in Allentown.History of the Lehigh County Agricultural Society, p. 8 The initial fair was so successful that in 1853 the Society undertook the purchase of a larger plot of land, north of Liberty Street and between Fifth and Sixth Streets, on which ticket offices and a two-story exhibition hall were built.History, p. 9 This location was the site of the second fair, held September 28, 29 and 30 of the same year. One of the most popular attractions of these early fairs was Stephen Lentz's Flying Coach, a brass band that performed atop a hay wagon.History, p. 13 In 1862, there was no fair due to the Civil War. During this time, the fairgrounds were used as a staging site for the 176th Regiment of Pennsylvania Volunteers. The fair resumed in 1863. In 1876, in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence, a large reenactment of the Battle of Bunker Hill was held, which included many of Lehigh County's Civil War regiments and veterans as participants.History, p. 15 The \\"centennial\\" fair was a tremendous success. New fairgrounds and new name Throughout the 1870s and 1880s, the popularity of the Allentown Fair continued to grow. However, increased attendance led to dissatisfaction regarding the fairground's size, facilities, short race track and small grandstand.History, p. 17 In 1889, the Lehigh County Agricultural Society purchased a plot of land on Seventeenth Street, between Chew and Liberty Streets, to serve as the new fairgrounds. One of the primary features of the new location was a new half-mile race track, with grandstands capable of seating 2,500. In celebration of the opening of the new fairgrounds, the fair was renamed the \\"Great Allentown Fair.\\" The Great Allentown Fair in the 20th Century The Horse Exhibit Hall on the Allentown Fairgrounds in the early 1900s. From its earliest days, horse racing was a popular event at the Allentown Fair. In 1902, the fair's half-mile track was regarded as \\"one of the finest in the country.\\"History, page 25 In 1905, racehorse Dan Patch set a record of 2:01 on the half-mile track. In 1908, a new grandstand was built at the Allentown Fairgrounds that increased seating capacity from 2,500 to 10,000. As of 2009, this structure remains in use as the Fairgrounds' grandstand. Between the years 1907 and 1914, airship races became a featured attraction at the fair. In 1909, two airships - one bearing the American flag, the other that of Germany, took off from the fairgrounds, raced down Hamilton Street, circled the Soldiers & Sailors Monument, and returned. The airship bearing the American flag won the race. The following year, pilot Glenn Curtiss took off in his plane, using 19th Street as his runway, and flew over the Allentown Fair, in what was the first known heavier- than-air flight in the Lehigh Valley. The first auto race was held at the fair in 1915. Sprint car races were sanctioned by the American Automobile Association (until 1955), the United States Automobile Club (1956–1966) and the International Motor Contest Association (1967 and 1968). Sprint car legends Tommy Hinnershitz and Ira Vail both captured numerous wins on the half-mile dirt track, and Indianapolis 500 winners Mario Andretti, A. J. Foyt and Parnelli Jones all raced at the Allentown Fair before going on to greater fame. In 1960, Johnny Thomson was killed during a race at the fair when his car crashed through the inside track fence. Although the last sanctioned auto race was held in 1968, demolition derbies continued to be popular event. There was no fair held in 1917 and 1918 due to World War I. During this period, the fairground was transformed into Camp Crane, a training facility for the United States Army Ambulance Service (USAAS). During this time, more than 20,000 soldiers lived in tents and barracks on the fairgrounds. The caretaker's house, which stood at 1701 Chew Street until demolished in 1960 to make room for a bank, was used as the officer's club. The fair wasn't held between 1942 & 1945\\\\. In 1951, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, his wife, and his son Arthur attended \\"Father and Son\\" day at the Allentown Fair, a visit described by local historian Frank Whelan as \\"probably among the most significant moments in the fair's history.\\" Beginning in the 1960s, musical concerts and performances held during Fair week starting drawing major acts and large crowds. Roy Rogers and Lawrence Welk appeared during the 1960s, as did Johnny Carson and a touring version of Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. Andy Williams introduced the Osmond Brothers in 1964. In 1964, Kate Smith made her first \\"community fair\\" performance at the Allentown Fair. Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass headlined in 1966, and the back cover of their album S.R.O. even featured a photograph taken during their performance. On August 8, 1974, Liza Minnelli delayed her concert while Richard Nixon's resignation speech was broadcast live over the public address system.

Consisting of two buildings dating to the late 19th century, it was the first residential building of its type in the city, built by local industrialist Frank Beebe, who occupied one of its units. When opened, it offered high quality furnished and unfurnished residences in a full-service environment. The hotel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It continues to be used for residences. Description and history The Maplewood Hotel is located on Maple Street in downtown Holyoke, at the corner of Essex Street and overlooking Library Park. It consists of two buildings that have become conjoined by internal connections. The 2-1/2 story brick block at 330 Maple Street was built first, between 1884 and 1889, while the four story building at 328 Maple Street was built c. 1890. The latter was opened as the Maplewood Hotel, providing furnished and unfurnished residences to middle and upper class residents of the city. In 1924 the two buildings were joined by connections through their adjacent walls. The hotel was the brainchild of industrialist Frank Beebe, whose father had started Holyoke's Beebe and Webber textile mills. Beebe took over his father's businesses, and expanded them, increasing the family fortune. He retired from that business in 1901, devoting himself to philanthropic endeavours. He gave the Maplewood to a social services organization in 1921, which effected the combination of the two buildings, and promoted Beebe's philosophies of better living and self-help to its tenants and the community.

Built in 1794 as a residence, it has served for most of two centuries as a local traveler's accommodation, and retains fine Federal period architectural details. > It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. It continues to serve its historic function, and is now operated as a bed and breakfast inn. Description and history The Merrell Tavern is located on the south side of Pleasant Street, near the western end of the roughly linear village. It is a 3-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide, with a gable roof and brick sidewalls. The main facade is covered by a two-story porch extending across its full width. The porch is supported by tapered square columns on the first level, and round Doric columns on the second. The tavern was built as a residence in 1794 by Joseph Whiton, a local militia commander. It was one of the first brick houses of the Federal period in the region, with some of its design elements taken from the published drawings of Asher Benjamin. It was acquired in 1815 by the Merrell family, who would operate it has a tavern for over a century. The Merrells enlarged the building, adding its third story ballroom and its two-story porch in 1838. The inn's taproom is remarkably well-preserved, with nearly all of its original features intact, including painted oak graining. The inn was acquired in the 20th century by the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities (now Historic New England, or HNE), which operated it as one of its museum properties for a time. It has since been sold into private ownership, with preservation easements held by HNE.

The district is roughly bounded by Main Street and River Church, Southfield, Clayton, School, and Hayes Hill Roads. It encompasses about , and contains mostly 19th century residential and civic buildings, as well as remnants of 19th century industrial activity. The principal defining feature of the district is its narrow setting along the Konkapot River. The significant drop of the river in the area ( over a stretch of the river) prompted the construction of many dams and mills, of which remnants of eight survive. The housing stock in the village was built mainly in the first half of the 19th century, during the height of industrial activity, and features simple two story wood frame housing, usually with Greek Revival styling. Some houses predate the industrial period, and a number of houses were built later in the 19th century. The village declined in importance as an industrial center after the railroad was built through town, but not near the village, and most of its industrial infrastructure was eventually abandoned. The civic buildings in the district include two Romanesque churches built in the 1860s, as well as the town hall, library, and school. A few commercial buildings from the era have also survived, including the current general store. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

It is located on Cole Avenue and other streets east of Cole and south of the Hoosac River, which provided the mill's power. The complex dates to the mid-19th century, and includes tenement houses, housing for supervisors and specialty personnel, as well as a surviving mill building. The village district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Station Mill village occupies about on the east side of Cole Avenue, just south of the Hoosac River. The residential portions of the village are characterized by rows of architecturally similar buildings. Most are of wood frame construction, either one or two stories in height, and house either one or two living units. The village was described in 1878 by a North Adams newspaper as a \\"model manufacturing community\\". The original mill building was built in 1866 for a textile business operated by Williams College president Paul Chadbourne. Demand for workers led to a shortage of housing in the area, and a number of tenement-style double housing units were built near the mill by the company. A number of civic buildings, including a church, store, and school were also built to see to the workers' needs. The textile business failed in 1929, and the plant was adapted for the manufacture of photographic paper in the 1930s. That business was shut down in 1989, after which the mill stood vacant. Part of the original 1866 building's roof collapsed in 2003, and it was subsequently demolished.

This designation included the North Adams Public Library (formerly the Blackinton Mansion), the First Baptist Church and First Congregational Church, and a block of shops Eagle Street. In 1988, the district's boundaries were increased to be roughly bounded by Holden, Center and Union Streets, the East Middle School (now the Silvio O.

This expansion extended the district westward along Summer Street to include the US Post Office building and St. John's Church, and eastward to include Colgrove Park, the middle school, and St. Francis Catholic Church. An additional block of commercial buildings was also added on the north side of West Main Street, extending just west of Holden Street. North Adams was settled as part of Adams in the mid-18th century, and soon developed as an industrial village, powered by the waters of the two branches of the Hoosic River, which meet just northwest of its central business district. The waterfront areas were developed with mills producing a variety of goods, which were eventually dominated by textiles beginning in the mid-19th century. The central business district around Monument Square, were the town's Baptist Church was founded in 1808, led by Otis Blackinton, whose family would dominate the local industrial business landscape.

Developed beginning in the mid-19th century, they were a major American producer of jacquard fabrics, operating until 1955. The mill complexes were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Today, some parts of the complex houses artists and small businesses. Description and history The Monument Mills are a prominent central feature of Housatonic village, lining both sides of the Housatonic River, from which they initially drew their power. The number one mill is located near the northern end of the village, between the railroad tracks and the river's west bank. The number two mill is located on the east bank of the river, just north of Park Street bridge. The Monument Mills Company operated a textile business at these sites between 1850 and 1955. The first mill, operating at the northern end of the complex, was fitted for cotton fabric production, and was joined by the second mill, under separate ownership, in 1866. The second mill specialized in the production of jacquard fabrics for bedspreads; its success prompted the first company to buy the second, and expand production. A decline in demand and changing tastes in textiles brought about reduced business, and the mills closed in 1955, which thereafter suffered from vacancy and neglect. The company was also responsible for the construction of the Glendale Power House further up the Housatonic River in Stockbridge; this facility was one of the first hydroelectric power stations built to provide power for industrial work, and is also listed on the National Register.

It is a hunt game. It uses an Alquerque board, and therefore, Bagh bandi is specifically a tiger hunt game (or tiger game). There are two tigers attempting to elude and capture as many goats while the goats are attempting to surround and trap the tigers. An uncommon feature in this game is that the goats are piled up on four points of the board at the beginning of the game. The only other hunt game to use this feature is Sher-bakar, a game closely related to Bagh bandi.  Goal  The goats win if they surround and immobilize the two tigers. The tigers win if they capture enough goats so that they cannot immobilize the tigers.  Equipment  The empty board The board is an Alquerque board. There are 2 tigers represented as 2 black pieces. There are 20 goats represented as 20 white pieces.  Gameplay  #Players decide who will play which animal. #In the beginning, the 2 tigers are placed on the middle column. Specifically, one tiger is placed on the second point from the top of the middle column, and the other tiger is placed on the fourth point. The goats are placed on the second left most column and second right most column. The goats are specifically placed on the first point and third point of each column from the top. Therefore, there are four points on the board that all the 20 goats are placed upon initially, and each of the four points has 5 goats each. #Players alternate their turns throughout the game. Only one piece may used to move or capture per turn. The goats start first. #The goat player may take the top goat of a pile, and place it onto any vacant adjacent point following the pattern on the board. Or the goat player can take any single goat on the board and move it one space onto any vacant adjacent point following the pattern on the board. A goat may not move onto a pile, or onto a single goat piece to form a pile. (Similarly, a tiger may be moved one space onto a vacant adjacent point following the pattern on the board.) #A tiger can capture by the short leap as in draughts or Alquerque. The tiger leaps over the adjacent goat, and lands on a vacant point immediately beyond. The leap must be in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board. A tiger can also leap over a pile of goats, but only captures the top most goat of the pile, and lands onto a vacant point on the other side. Again, the jump must be in a straight line and follow the pattern on the board. Only one capture is allowed per turn, however, another source states that multiple captures are allowed. If multiple captures are allowed, the tiger, however, cannot jump back and forth on the same pile to capture all of its pieces in one turn. Captures are not compulsory. #Goats cannot capture.

The fifth tropical cyclone and fifth named storm of the hurricane season, Edouard developed from a trough in the northern Gulf of Mexico on August 3\\\\. After developing into a tropical depression, it gradually strengthened and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Edouard on August 4\\\\. However, northerly wind shear initially halted any further significant intensification and also caused the storm to struggle to maintain deep convection over the center. Edouard eventually intensified further and peaked as a strong tropical storm with winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) on August 5\\\\. Shortly thereafter, the storm made landfall near Gilchrist, Texas later that day. Edouard quickly weakened and was downgraded to tropical depression by early on August 6, six hours before degenerated into a remnant low pressure area. Due to the relatively weak nature of the storm, impact was generally minor. Rip currents in Alabama and Florida led to five fatalities. The sixth death from the storm was also related to rough seas and occurred near the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana. Storm surge and high tides also caused coastal flooding in the state, especially in Cameron Parish. Relatively strong winds left more than 2,000 without electricity and damaged trees and the roofs of mobile homes. Storm surge caused coastal flooding in eastern Texas, particularly in the Gilchrist area. At least 25 homes sustained damage, while portions of a few major roads, such as Interstate 10, were closed. Minor inland flooding occurred due to heavy rainfall, with a portion of Texas State Highway 36 being temporarily shutdown. Strong winds in the region damaged hundreds of homes, downed trees, and left about 300,000 people without electricity. Overall, damage from Tropical Storm Edouard totaled slightly more than $550,000 (2008 USD). Meteorological history On August 2, 2008, a trough entered the northern Gulf of Mexico, with a low pressure area developing near Apalachicola, Florida. The system maintained scattered deep convection across offshore waters and environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis. The system tracked generally west-southwestward, due to its position south of a subtropical ridge extending from Texas through Florida. On the afternoon of August 3, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system confirmed the development of a well-defined center of circulation, slightly exposed from a disorganized area of thunderstorms. As a result, the system developed into Tropical Depression Five at 1200 UTC on August 3, while located about 85 miles (140 km) south of the mouth of the Mississippi River. Because the depression was initially located in an area of northerly wind shear and dry air, the National Hurricane Center forecast it to slowly intensify. After a burst in deep convection late on August 3, Hurricane Hunter data indicated flight level winds of . At 0000 UTC on August 4, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Edouard. Later that day, convection temporarily decreased around the center, though a brief convective flare up on its east side occurred early on August 5\\\\. Due to decreasing westerly wind shear, the center was nearly surrounded by convection that afternoon. Further organization continued and at 1200 UTC on August 5, Edouard attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of . Simultaneously, the storm made landfall at the McFaddin and Texas Point National Wildlife Refuges near Gilchrist, Texas at the same intensity. It weakened rapidly after moving inland and was downgraded to a tropical depression late on August 5\\\\. Edouard then re-curved northwest over eastern Texas, before degenerating into a remnant low pressure area at 0600 UTC on August 6\\\\. The remnant low continued northwestward until dissipating over northern Texas early on August 7. Preparations Several tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in association with Tropical Storm Edouard. At 2100 UTC on August 3, a tropical storm watch was posted from Intracoastal City, Louisiana to Port O'Connor, Texas. Simultaneously, a tropical storm warning was issued from Intracoastal City to the mouth of the Mississippi River in Louisiana. The tropical storm watch was upgraded to a hurricane watch early on August 4\\\\. Around that time, the tropical storm warning was extended from the mouth of the Mississippi River to Cameron, Louisiana. At 0900 UTC on August 4, the tropical storm warning was revised to reach San Luis Pass, Texas. The hurricane watch was modified from Grand Isle, Louisiana to Sargent, Texas. The tropical storm warning was extended to include the mouth of the Mississippi River to Port O'Connor at 1500 UTC on August 5\\\\. At that time, the tropical storm warning was modified again to stretch from San Luis Pass to Cameron. Late on August 5, all tropical cyclones were discontinued. In the Gulf of Mexico, Shell Oil evacuated about 40 workers from drilling operations. BP and Chevron also evacuated workers from platforms in the western and central Gulf, though neither predicted substantial effects on production. A few oil refineries on land were closed, such as one operated by Marathon Oil in Texas City, Texas. Governor of Texas Rick Perry issued a disaster declaration for 17 Texas counties that were threatened by Tropical Storm Edouard. Perry activated up to 1,200 National Guard troops, a 70 member rescue team, six helicopters, and an incident management team that brings food and water to affected areas. Under the order, about 200 buses became available in San Antonio and Houston to help in evacuations. Dow Chemical shut down their plants in Clear Lake and La Porte. The United States Coast Guard also ceased cargo operations to the Galveston-Houston area by late on August 4. Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal declared a statewide emergency. In Cameron Parish, Louisiana the Office of Emergency Preparedness ordered a mandatory evacuation, where Sheriff's deputies also erected roadblocks. Impact=Florida, Alabama, and Louisiana Navigational buoy snapped loose and beached near Holly Beach, LA. Rip currents in Florida and Alabama led to the deaths of five people, three of which occurred in Panama City, Florida. Along the coast, storm surge in Louisiana generally ran above normal, although a slightly higher tide was reported near Intracoastal City. Due to the storm surge, part of Louisiana Highway 82 was closed between Holly Beach and Johnson Bayou. Additionally, Interstate 10 was also flooded by storm surge. Minor flooding from the surge traveled up the Calcasieu River to Lake Charles, where water flooded a local yacht club. Low-lying areas of Intracoastal City were flooded, disrupting marine industries. A man fell overboard from a shrimp boat and died in rough seas from Edouard near the mouth of the Mississippi River. This was the only death directly associated with Tropical Storm Edouard. Three locations reported tropical storm force winds, including on Timbalier Island, in Calcasieu Pass, and on Marsh Island. In Cameron, Vermilion, and Calcasieu Parishes, wind gusts were mainly between , though a gust of was observed at Calcasieu Pass. Winds severely damaged several mobile homes in Cameron, mostly from roofs being torn off. More than 3,000 people were left without electricity in Cameron Calcasieu Parishes combined as winds downed trees and power lines. A few mobile homes in that parish sustained minor wind damage. In Vermilion Parish, a few trees and power lines were downed. Rainfall in Louisiana reached at Hackberry; at other locations, precipitation was mainly between . Overall, Edouard caused about $350,000 in damage within the state of Louisiana. Texas Edouard's storm total rainfall Rainfall from Edouard peaked at at Baytown, Texas, near Houston. In central Texas, a burst of thunderstorm activity near the storm's center produced of rain near Hamilton, Texas; as a result, part of Texas State Highway 36 was closed due to flooding. Elsewhere, of precipitation was reported. The heavy rainfall was expected to help relieve persistent drought conditions in some locations. Winds gusted to over , peaking at over . Furthermore, a wind gust of was reported at Texas Point. Due to the high winds, falling trees and power lines left at least 300,000 customers in Southeastern Texas without electricity, most of them in Jefferson County. Hundreds of homes also suffered damage. Storm surge ranged between 2 and 5 feet (0.60-1.5 m) along the coast. In addition, high surf battered the shore. Minor storm surge flooding along portions of the Bolivar Peninsula caused $95,000 in damage. The coastal flooding forced the closure of and caused $5,000 in damage to Interstate 10 in Chambers County. Near Baytown, water flooded a few garages. Additionally, at least 27 homes in Gilchrist flooded. Two mobile homes and fifteen single-family homes had of water; as much as of water was reported in ten other single-family houses. At the McFaddin and Texas Point National Wildlife Refuges, losses in the park totaled to $100,000. Overall, effects from Tropical Storm Edouard in the state of Texas resulted in approximately $200,000 in damage.

The game takes place in the students' home. The player can choose to play as either Vyvyan, Rick, Neil, or Mike to explore the house and enter different rooms. The other characters become computer-controlled players. All characters can move around the house, pick up and drop objects, as well as break and fix things. The characters often talk, giving the player clues as to what the character is intended to do. The aim of the game is to try and move out of the house with all the character's belongings in the shortest time possible. This is not so easy, because these possessions are typically not in their preferred condition, or are hidden around the house, and players need various tools to get to them. The other characters will move around the house, behaving in-character, occasionally moving around or further damaging the possessions - making the task harder. The game was published by Orpheus Software, based in Hatley St George in Bedfordshire, UK. The concept of the game was created by Orpheus director Paul Kaufman (previously director of Oric software house, Tansoft). The majority of the game was programmed by John Marshall, with input from Geoff Phillips. The characters of The Young Ones were licensed from the owners of the BBC television series, Ben Elton, Rik Mayall, and Lise Mayer. Screen shot from the Commodore 64 version of the game Due to difficulty in licensing the original series music from the BBC, an alternative music sound track was commissioned to sound similar to the original theme. Over 10,000 copies of the game were sold, mainly through Boots stores, Woolworths and independent computer stores. Reception In a review of the game, British computer magazine Your Sinclair said that fans of the series would probably enjoy the game but others could tire of it quickly. It was given a 7/10 rating.

It would be easy to label Makuck a naturalist after reading > this collection, as fully three-fourths of the pieces are about encounters > with whales, hawks, fish, weather, shifting sandbars and whatnot. But . . . > Makuck does not see nature as wholly benevolent. There is always an > undercurrent of danger, of quiet violence, times when a quick squall can > blow in from offshore, when the beauty of the landed fish is admired for a > moment before the knife is unsheathed. Hawks and hurricanes cannot be held > to moral standards, and Makuck revels in revealing this seam where violence > and calm collide. . . . Works Poetry * Mandatory Evacuation.

It was first published in 1918, so it is in the public domain.Bates, p. 133 This poem was Section VII of the poem—sequence \\"Lettres d'un Soldat\\" (1918). It was extracted as \\"Negation\\" for inclusion in the second edition of Harmonium. It may reflect Stevens's reading of Thus Spoke Zarathustra, according to Bates. The poem's image of God as bungling potter recalls Zarathustra's dialogue with the last pope, in which God is similarly characterized. Another Harmonium poem that clearly reflects Stevens's reading of Nietzsche is \\"The Surprises of the Superhuman\\", which was also extracted from \\"Lettres d'un Soldat\\" for inclusion in the second edition. The poem is notable for its arch wit and the anti-poetical salutation, \\"Hi!\\", rather than as a solution to the problem of evil.

A polvorón (From polvo, the Spanish word for powder, or dust) is a type of heavy, soft, and very crumbly Spanish shortbread made of flour, sugar, milk, and nuts (especially almonds). They are mostly produced in Andalusia, where there are about 70 factories that are part of a syndicate that produces polvorones and mantecados.Spanish mantecado: sweet treat beats economic downturn Under the name mantecados, these sweets are a traditional preparation of other areas of the Iberian Peninsula as well. Polvorones are popular holiday delicacies in all of Spain, Hispanic America and the Philippines. Traditionally, they were prepared from September to January but are now available all year round. Mantecado Mantecado is a name for a variety of Spanish shortbreads that includes the polvorón. Often both names are synonymous, but not all mantecados are polvorones. The name mantecado comes from manteca (lard), usually the fat of Iberian pig (cerdo ibérico), with which they are made, while the name polvorón is based on the fact that these cakes crumble easily into a kind of dust in the hand or the mouth. In Cuba and Puerto Rico, mantecado is an ice cream and in Spain it may be also the name given to a kind of sweet sherbet.Helado mantecado In the Philippines, mantecado is a popular traditional ice cream flavour, characterised as a mixture of vanilla and butter. It was served during the 29 September 1898 luncheon banquet that followed the Malolos Congress' ratification of the Philippine Declaration of Independence in June that year. Regional variations=Cuba In Cuba, it is one of the most common flavors of ice cream. Cuba, being the Latin American country in the Caribbean where Spain had the most interest and influence, has adapted the flavors of mantecado or polvorones from Spain into a delicious and beloved flavor for Cuban ice cream. Known worldwide for the delicious flavoring, what some might call a Latin vanilla, this Cuban flavor has influenced ice cream flavors made in other Latin American places such as Puerto Rico. Philippines Filipino cookies 'n cream-flavored pulburon from Goldilocks Bakeshop The Filipino version of polvorón uses a large amount of powdered milk which is left dry, as well as toasted flour, sugar, and butter or margarine instead of lard. A number of local variants on the traditional polvorón recipe have been made. Well-known variants include polvorón with kasuy (cashew nut), with pinipig (pounded and toasted young green rice, similar to crisped rice) and with malunggay leaves. Strawberry, chocolate-coated, ube (purple yam), peanut, and cookies and cream flavoured polvorón also exist. Spain Polvorones are a common Christmas dessert in Spain. Today, there are other options for the fat used in the sweet other than pig fat, like butter, as well as vegetarian polvorones and mantecados made with olive oil. United States Sometimes called Pan de Polvo, the sweet is made with anise in the south Texas region.

The bay has a shoreline of around and has a popular sandy shingle beach which is over half a mile long. It is a tourist site with three holiday parks in the vicinity of the bay; it has two cafes though minimal facilities. Access is limited and only possible down two steeply sloping concrete tracks. The site is of major geological interest, being part of the Whitecliff Bay And Bembridge Ledges SSSI. Geology View of the bay from Culver Down Whitecliff Bay has nearly identical geology to the lesser known Alum Bay, being a coastal section of the same strata which run east-west across the island. It displays a classic sequence of fossil-bearing Eocene beds of soft sands and clays, separated by an unconformity from the underlying Cretaceous Chalk Formation forming the headland of Culver Down to its south. Due to geological folding of the Alpine orogeny, the strata in the main section of the Bay are vertical, with younger rocks to the north.West, Ian M. 2007. , Geology of the Wessex Coast of England.

Version: 25 July 2007, retrieved 3 August 2008 In the bay, there are around of well-exposed sands and of late Palaeocene to late Eocene clays which make the site is a good spot for fossil hunting, with an abundance of prehistoric shells, sponges and molluscs. The bay itself is shallow up to around from shore getting to deep water out. History Whitecliff Bay was one of the landing points for the French invasion of the Isle of Wight (1545) where they planned to go on to attack Sandown. The bay gets its name from the chalky cliff on the headland, Culver Down, which rises over at the south-eastern point of the bay.

Ipswich: Golgonooza, 1995. Critchlow was a lecturer at the Architectural Association (AA) School of Architecture in London for twelve years. Whilst at the AA, he was invited to teach at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Ghana by R. Buckminster Fuller, the American engineer, architect and futurist. Buckminster Fuller wrote of Critchlow: > \\"Keith Critchlow has one of the century’s rare conceptual minds. He is > continually inspired by the conceptioning of both earliest and latest > record. He lauds the work of others while himself pouring forth, in great > modesty, whole vista-filling new realizations of nature’s mathematical > structuring.… He is one of the most inspiring scholar-teachers I have had > the privilege to know\\". Whilst in Ghana, Critchlow and his colleague Dr Michael Ben-Eli studied Fuller geometry and experimented in the construction of geodesic domes using local building materials, such as palm, bamboo and aluminium. One of their aims was to help reduce use of concrete and minimise the negative impact of construction on the environment. In 1969, Critchlow formed Polyhedral Developments (a private company) in partnership with architectural designer Hayward Hill; together they pioneered the use of polyhedral domes as emergency shelters for families who had lost their homes to disaster. Critchlow and colleagues experimented in the use of lightweight materials for the construction of domes, including Tri-Wall Pak corrugated board, to aid in transport and assembly by unskilled labour in disaster areas.FOLDED SURFACE STRUCTURES - The Potential Use of Paperboard for Low Cost Enclosures. By Vinzenz Franz-Josef Sedlak, Dipl. 3hg. (Arch.). A thesis submitted for the Degree of Master of Philosophy in Structural Engineering in the Department of Civil Engineering; University of Surrey, March 1975. Critchlow was professor of Islamic Art at the Royal College of Art in London from 1975 for many years.Male, Lydia Sharman, \\"In the Mind of the Beholder\\", Saudi Aramco World, May/June 1990 He also delivered lectures on the application of sacred geometry in architecture at the Lindisfarne Association in New York City and then Crestone, Colorado, in the United States from 1978. In Crestone, he contributed to a number of summer schools for Lindisfarne and taught alongside innovative thinkers from both the arts and sciences, including social philosopher and cultural critic, William Irwin Thompson (founder of the Lindisfarne Association), mythographer and symbolist Robert Lawlor, poet and environmental activist Wendell Berry, biologist John Todd, and environmentalist James Lovelock. Critchlow founded the Visual Islamic and Traditional Arts (VITA) department in 1984, which moved from the Royal College of Art to The Prince's Institute of Architecture in 1992–3, where he was director of research. The institute later evolved into The Prince's Foundation, within which Prince's School of Traditional Arts (PSTA) is housed. He was professor emeritus at PSTA and served as director of research.Prince's School of Traditional Arts – Trustees and Staff \\"Dr Keith Critchlow, Professor Emeritus, Founder, and Director of Research\\" He also taught at The Prince's Foundation for the Built Environment. In 1983, Critchlow was asked by Indian philosopher and author Jiddu Krishnamurti to design the Krishnamurti Study Centre in Hampshire, UK, which was completed in 1986.The Krishnamurti Centre in England His other architectural works include, the Lindisfarne Chapel in Crestone, Colorado, in the United States with a special design for the vaulting of the dome,Creston Mountain Zen Center – location and history of the dome Lindisfarne Chapel and a hospital, the Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Medical Sciences in Puttaparthi, India. Isaac Tigrett, who had founded the Hard Rock Cafe enterprise, secured Critchlow's expertise to design the hospital in Puttuparthi.Lerwill, John, \\"Who is Sai\\" His use of sacred geometry played a major role in these architectural designs and projects. Critchlow made an important contribution to the re-construction of the Minbar of Saladin in the al-Aqsa Mosque, Jerusalem. The minbar was destroyed by fire in 1969 following an arson attack by an evangelical Christian. King Hussein of Jordan launched a 30-year search, including international competitions, to find a sufficiently qualified person to re-design the intricate patterns of the minbar. The competition was finally won by Dr Minwer Al-Meheid who was inspired to make his submission after spending a year studying Critchlow's work: > \\"Seemingly, the ancient knowledge of how to map the structure geometrically > had been lost. Until, that is, Minwer al-Meheid, an engineer from Jordan, > walked into a bookshop in Damascus and fell upon a work that contained the > answers.

It is home to the Sun N Surf Restaurant and the Anchorage Inn. Short Sands Beach Short Sands Beach – This is the other beach and is located on the north side of Cape Neddick, home of Cape Neddick Light, locally known as \\"Nubble Light\\".

Arab Argentines are one of the largest Arab diaspora groups in the world. Although a highly diverse group of Argentines — in ancestral origins, religion and historic identities — Arab Argentines hold a common identity in the Argentinan consciousness, being universally known as \\"turcos\\" (\\"Turks\\") (like in the rest of Latin American countries The majority of the Arab Argentines are from either Lebanese or Syrian background with a smaller amount of Palestinian, Egyptian and Moroccan background. The interethnic marriage in the Arab community, regardless of religious affiliation, is very high; most community members have only one parent who has Arab ethnicity. As a result of this, the Arab community in Argentina shows marked language shift away from Arabic. Only a few speak any Arabic and such knowledge is often limited to a few basic words. Instead the majority, especially those of younger generations, speak Spanish as a first language, and have thoroughly assimilated in the local culture, Arab Argentines have been a regular presence and distinguished themselves in all walks of national life on a par with the rest of the country's melting pot population. History There are some indications that the Arab Muslim presence within present day Argentinian territory dates back to the time of the Spanish exploration and conquest. The first mentioned Arab settlers were the 15th century's Moorish (Morisco) Muslims of the Iberian peninsula that were people of Arab North African descent who explored the Americas with Spanish explorers, many of them settling in Argentina who were fleeing from persecution such as the Spanish Inquisition. However, in the 19th century Argentina saw the first real wave of Arabs to settle within its territory. Most of the Arabs who came during this time period were from Lebanon and Syria as a result of the 1860 Mount Lebanon civil war (During that time, Lebanon and Syria were Ottoman provinces). While Arab communities existed by 1864, systematic records did not appear before 1868. From 1891 to 1920, 367,348 people of Arabic heritage immigrated into Argentina. When they were first processed in the ports of Argentina, they were classified as Turks (Spanish turcos) because what is modern day Lebanon and Syria was a territory of the Turkish Ottoman Empire, hence the popular (and erroneous) demonym (comparable to others applied in the majority immigrant country to other groups, such as \\"tano\\" (Italian) \\"gallego\\" (Spaniard) \\"ruso\\" (Jew) etc. The causes for Arabs to leave their homeland were an accelerated increase in demographics in Lebanon, the persecution by the Ottoman Turks and the Italo- Turkish War. The Arab immigrants settled in the provinces of Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Salta, Jujuy, Tucumán, La Rioja, San Juan, Mendoza, Santiago del Estero, Misiones, Chaco, and the Patagonia. A large percentage on Arabs settled in the Cuyo region (which is made up of the provinces of San Juan, San Luis, Mendoza, and La Rioja) whose landscape and crops (olive, vineyards) resemble at time the Middle East's.

It is the first film in Van Beuren's Tom and Jerry series, later re-issued as \\"Dick and Larry\\". Plot In their first film, Tom and Jerry are taxi drivers at the train station on a stormy day, waiting for a fare. A train comes up, and stops with an engine hauling a coach to let off two identical-looking men, who come out, similar to the pair from the Farmer Alfalfa cartoon Wooden Money. They both try to get them in the taxi. After the men are settled, Tom drives the men. It rains so much, a frog jumps in to taxi and went back again. They reach a castle, and as the men walk in, Tom and Jerry run to the men to be paid, but are locked inside. Then, a cloud turns into a human-like figure with arms. He then plays crenellations as piano keys, and while near towers act as pipes, similar to a pipe organ, two trees play their own branches like piccolos. As they walk, Tom is mortified as Jerry is interested as a giant bat-like creature appears in front of them. They come to a room where a skeleton is cleaning itself. After this point, they are sure paranormal things are happening. Odd things that happen include: ghosts standing behind them, finding a skeleton playing a piano while another skeleton dances to the music, a glove dancing, and a blackface quartette of skeletons singing a song, which includes a few lines from versions of \\"Golden Slippers\\", such as a \\"long white robe\\" and a \\"starry crown\\", and to stop gambling. After these things had happened, the two men walk in and point at Jerry. Jerry lifts his shirt, and now realizes he's a skeleton, too. Tom laughs, and now realizes he is a skeleton when Jerry lifts his shirt, too. Tom is terrified, and as both men run for their lives, the cartoon ends.

As a young captain of the Dutch General Staff he wrote a rebuttal of the British military historian William Siborne's account of the Battle of Quatre Bras and the Battle of Waterloo, published as History of the war in France and Flanders in 1815 in 1844, in which Siborne disparaged the conduct of the Dutch army at these battles. Siborne's book had caused a furore in the Netherlands as he saw fit to insult the honor of the Dutch army, and of king William II of the Netherlands, who as Prince of Orange had commanded that army at both battles, and was revered as a national hero by the Dutch. As Siborne's book is still in use as a source for Anglophone historiography of the battles, and is still the subject of controversy, Knoop's criticisms are still relevant, and play a role in this controversy. Biography Knoop, a lifelong bachelor, was the son of colonel Willem Hendrik Knoop and Henrica Willemina Hartkamp. He spent his early years in Bruges (his father was military governor there) where he frequented the library of the Maatschappij der Letterkunde, a Dutch benevolent society, promoting popular education, where he proved a promising autodidact. He started his military career at age 14 in 1825 as a volunteer in the Sixth Division Infantry in Bruges. In 1829 he was commissioned as a second-lieutenant of infantry. In 1842, with the rank of captain of infantry, he was appointed as professor of strategy, tactics, and military history at the Royal Military Academy of the Netherlands at Breda. (As such he was apportioned to the Dutch General Staff). As a reward for his work there he was made a knight in the Order of the Netherlands Lion in 1845.Netscher, p. 279 Duel This was remarkable, because in 1844 he had become involved in a celebrated scandal. Like many contemporary military men, Dutch officers were prone to duelling, though this was a criminal offense. A colleague of Knoop at the Academy, Professor Bolhuis, had quarrelled with a young cavalry officer, and Knoop had been one of his seconds at the ensuing duel. Unfortunately, Bolhuis had been killed at this duel on 14 February 1844, and Knoop had subsequently been arrested for his participation in this \\"affair of honor.\\" He was court-martialed and acquitted, but after the prosecution appealed to the High Military Court, sentenced to three years in prison. However, he was soon pardoned by King Wiliam II, and apparently his career did not suffer.Netscher, p. 280-282 The Siborne Controversy Though Knoop of course had been only four at the time of the battle, so he had no personal knowledge, he could avail himself of the recollections of many Dutch veterans who had been there, and as a general-staff member he had access to the after- battle reports the Dutch units had made within two days after the battle ended. (These archived reports could have been made available to Siborne, and in one case he appears to have been in actual possession of one, but he never bothered to consult them (1993) Waterloo. New Perspectives. The Great Battle Reappraised, John Wiley & sons, , p.25 and fn. 12). As a trained historian, Knoop now started to research these sources and wrote a detailed repudiation of Siborne's book\\"Beschouwingen over Siborne's Geschiedenis van den oorlog van 1815 in Frankrijk en de Nederlanden\\" en wederlegging van de in dat werk voorkomende beschuldigingen tegen het Nederlandsche leger. Breda 1846; 2nd printing 1847; reprinted in: (1861) Krijgs- en geschiedkundige geschriften. Vol. 1, pp. 1-70 based on all these sources. This book (published with the explicit consent of King William II as a semi-official rebuttal), was received with much enthusiasm in Dutch military circles. When soon thereafter there was a false rumor in the Dutch press that captain Siborne was on his way to demand satisfaction, no less than six officers of horse-artillery spontaneously offered to act as Knoop's seconds, if necessary.Netscher, p. 283, fn. 1 Knoop's book was soon translated in French and German, and met with much interest in France and Prussia at the time. These translations were sent to the editor of the United Service Magazine, but no acknowledgement was ever received, at least directly. However, many years later Knoop received an indirect indication that his book had registered, when in the 17 February 1855 issue of the magazine Athenaeum, in a review of another historical article by his hand (quite unrelated) he was introduced as the man \\"...who acquired his first reputation by an angry and dashing attack on captain Siborne.\\".Netscher, pp. 284, 297 Siborne himself, though not deigning to reply directly to Knoop, wrote an indirect reply in a later edition of his work (reprinted in the modern edition) in which he repeated his bold accusations against the Dutch- Belgian troops, and complained about the tone in Knoop's \\"pamphlet,\\" which he calls \\"abusive.\\" In defense of his accusations he just states that these are based on the testimony of the officers he surveyed. History of the War in France and Belgium, in 1815. Containing Minute Details of the Battles of Quatre-Bras, Ligny, Wavre, and Waterloo, Adamant Media Corporation, , , pp. 391-392, fn. * Further career Knoop's military career progressed apace. Though his scholarly work at the Academy did not seem to prepare him for great military advances, he was promoted to colonel in 1858, commanding a regiment at Breda. In 1861 he was promoted to major-general, commanding divisions in Limburg and Noord-Brabant until he temporarily went into politics in 1869. He was a Liberal, unlike many of his colleagues, and as such not very popular with king William III of the Netherlands (who had succeeded his father William II in 1850). Probably because of his political leanings he had been offered the post of Minister of War in a Liberal Cabinet in 1862, but he declined. In 1869 he stood for the Second Chamber of the States-General of the Netherlands and was elected. This required that he temporarily resigned his commission. But he was recalled to duty during the mobilisation of the Dutch army at the crisis of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, during which the Netherlands maintained an armed neutrality. For that reason he had to resign his seat in parliament, as serving officers cannot sit in Dutch parliament. He retired as a lieutenant-general of infantry in 1872. During his entire career Knoop was a recognized authority on military history. In 1847 he became a contributor to the literary magazine De Gids that published many scholarly articles on historical subjects. As such he became a friend and colleague of the eminent Dutch historian Robert Fruin, with whom he sometimes had friendly disputes. He was the editor-in-chief of the Dutch military history journal Militaire Spectator from 1849 till 1869. His renown as a historian earned him a membership of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1857. He also was president of the Vereeniging tot beoefening van de krijgswetenschap (Society for military arts and science) for many years.Data taken from the entry in Parlement & Politiek In retirement he remained very active as a military scholar, writing many articles, and eventually publishing eleven volumes in a standard work on stadtholder William III.Krijgs- en Geschiedkundige Beschouwingen over Willem den Derde (1862-68 and 1895) A listing of his works, and many of those articles, are available online in the Digital library for Dutch literature (see External Links). Knoop died almost eighty-three years old in 1894.

After being threatened with demolition in the 1970s, the Plaza Substation was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Construction of the substation In May 1903, Henry Huntington, owner of the Los Angeles Railway, announced plans to build a new substation near the old plaza. The Los Angeles Times reported: \\"Another mammoth electricity substation is to be constructed by the Los Angeles Railway Company. Its location will be on the Plaza, and its completion will mean a long step forward toward the perfection of a system that already is surpassed by few in this country.\\" By 1905, the substation was operating, and the Times ran an article detailing the relationship between the railway's four substations and its central power station at Sixth Street and Central Avenue. The Times described the role of the Plaza Substation this way: > \\"From this place of manufacture, so to speak, the current is distributed to > four other substations scattered over the city, known respectively as the > Plaza, University, Westlake and South Park substations. In these there are > no oil furnaces, boilers, or steam engines; only the electric current itself > has to be dealt with, so that there is economy on the score both of plant > and of labor. The central station, besides generating the electricity, also > performs the work of a substation. It sends out about 40 per cent of the > power used for the operation of the street cars on the Los Angeles Railway > Company's system. The Plaza station, distributes the next 40 per cent used, > while the three others combined account for the remaining 20 per cent.\\" Closure of the Yellow Car system When the Yellow Cars stopped running in 1963, the building located along the city's old Mexican marketplace, Olvera Street, was converted to other uses. However, critics of the structure argued it was out of keeping with the pre-1900 flavor of Olvera Street and sought to remove it. In 1971, the Pueblo park's historian, Dr. Doyce Nunis, issued a report stating that the substation had \\"no identifiable historic value\\". Dr. Nunis wrote: \\"There was no identifiable distinguished architect involved (and) the design was commonplace.\\" Hand-Carved Window Covering Debate over preservation After receiving the historian's report, the city's Recreation and Parks Commission (with the support of Mayor Tom Bradley) voted 4-1 to demolish the building and replace it with a Mexican market and storage facility. At that point, Los Angeles Times architecture writer John Pastier published an article titled: \\"How Do You Make a Historical Monument? Tear Down a Historic Building?\\" Pastier noted that the Plaza Substation was the largest and most distinctive of the three surviving Yellow Car substations and urged the city to adapt the utilitarian structure into a tasteful tourist attraction as San Francisco had done with Ghirardelli Square and the Cannery. The State Park Department's director also stepped in opposing what he called the city's plan to turn the historic park into an amusement park. However, even the writers at the times were divided over preservation of the substation, as another columnist sided with the city and wrote: > \\"Saving the MTA Powerhouse in the Plaza is another debatable project. Is it > worth a continuing place along Olvera Street because it was a substation for > our early transit system? Because it survives as a sturdy example of good > contractor's performance? Because it sits near so much important history? I > think the substation is an excellent example of the way conserving can > become a disease.\\" A group called Californians for Preservation Action filed a lawsuit seeking to prevent the building's demolition, and a state court judge issued a restraining order halting the demolition. Ultimately, the Plaza Substation was saved, and funds set aside for its rehabilitation, as part of a settlement agreement reached in 1978. Historic designation The substation is one of the two buildings in the Los Angeles Plaza Historic District that is itself separately listed in the National Register of Historic Places, having been so listed in September 1978.

Mejía is a Spanish surname. Several theories exist as to its origins and etymology. The prevailing belief is that the name has Galician origins. The surname is most common in Spain and Latin American countries, including Colombia and Mexico. Etymology The surname may have originated as a toponym for the town of Muxia in Galicia, an autonomous community in north-western Spain.https://www.geni.com/surnames/mejiahttp://www.houseofnames.com/xq/asp.fc/qx/mejia- family-crest.htm Another idea is that the word \\"Mexia\\" used to mean \\"medicine\\" in an old variant of Spanish, and that this is where the surname came from. One common belief is that the name may have Sephardic origins, from when the Spanish Kingdom forced Jewish settlers to change their surname to Castillian. The translation of the surname for \\"Messiah\\" would then become the name \\"Mesía\\".https://www.scribd.com/doc/6078304/Apellidos-Sefarditas However, the Spanish people who travelled to the Spanish colonies in South America were not allowed to be Jewish or to have any Jewish or Muslim ancestors, and thus this explanation may not account for the popularity of the surname in modern-day Latin America. Note that Mexía is the older Spanish spelling of the name. In the modern orthography of Spain, the spelling is Mejía, though in Mexico the older orthography is still considered correct. (Similarly, until recently Spaniards rendered the country name Méjico rather than México, though this has reversed in recent decades out of deference to Mexico). Geographical distribution As of 2014, 23.7% of all known bearers of the surname Mejía were residents of Mexico (frequency 1:450), 16.2% of Colombia (1:253), 14.4% of Honduras (1:53), 8.0% of Guatemala (1:172), 6.5% of the Dominican Republic (1:138), 6.3% of the United States (1:4,915), 6.3% of El Salvador (1:86), 4.7% of Peru (1:583), 2.9% of Ecuador (1:475), 2.8% of Nicaragua (1:185), 2.5% of the Philippines (1:3,461), 2.0% of Venezuela (1:1,266) and 1.8% of Bolivia (1:510).

It is characteristic of the cuisines of the Egypt, Levant and the broader Middle East, along with South Caucasus, Balkans, the Maghreb and Central Asia. Etymology The word baklava is first attested in English in 1650,Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd edition a borrowing from Ottoman Turkish . The name baklava is used in many languages with minor phonetic and spelling variations. Historian Paul D. Buell argues that the word \\"baklava\\" may come from the Mongolian root ' 'to tie, wrap up, pile up' composed with the Turkic verbal ending -v; baγla- itself in Mongolian is a Turkic loanword. Sevan Nişanyan considers its oldest known forms (pre-1500) to be baklağı and baklağu, and labels it as being of Proto-Turkic origin.Nişanyan, Sevan (2009) (in Turkish). Sözlerin Soyağacı - Çağdaş Türkçenin Etimolojik Sözlüğü [Words' Family Tree - An Etymological Dictionary of Contemporary Turkish]. İstanbul. http://nisanyansozluk.com/?k=baklava Another form of the word is also recorded in Persian, ('). Though the suffix -vā might suggest a Persian origin,Marks, Gil, Encyclopedia of Jewish Food, John Wiley and Sons, 2010, , ; page 38. the baqla- part does not appear to be Persian and remains of unknown origin.\\"a derivation from balg, a common dialect form of barg \\"leaf\\", or from Ar. baql \\"herb\\" is unlikely\\", W. Eilers, Encyclopædia Iranica, s.v. 'bāqlavā' Linguist Tuncer Gülensoy states that the origin of baklava is bakl-ı (feed) in proto-Turkish and suffixes -la-ğı are added. The word changes as bakılağı > bakılavı > baklava. The Arabic name ' likely originates from Turkish, though a folk etymology, unsupported by Wehr's dictionary, connects it to Arabic 'bean'. History Although the history of baklava is not well documented, its current form was probably developed in the imperial kitchens of the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul.Perry 1994, 87 The Sultan presented trays of baklava to the Janissaries every 15th of the month of Ramadan in a ceremonial procession called the '. There are three proposals for the pre-Ottoman roots of baklava: the Roman placenta cake, as developed through Byzantine cuisine, [ Patrick Faas (2003). Around the Roman Table: Food and Feasting in Ancient Rome. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p. 185f.] the Central Asian Turkic tradition of layered breads,Perry, Charles. \\"The Taste for Layered Bread among the Nomadic Turks and the Central Asian Origins of Baklava\\", in A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East (ed. Sami Zubaida, Richard Tapper), 1994. , page 87 or the Persian lauzinaq. The oldest (2nd century BC) recipe that resembles a similar dessert is the honey- covered baked layered-dough dessert ' of Roman times, which Patrick Faas identifies as the origin of baklava: \\"The Greeks and the Turks still argue over which dishes were originally Greek and which Turkish. Baklava, for example, is claimed by both countries. Greek and Turkish cuisine both built upon the cookery of the Byzantine Empire, which was a continuation of the cooking of the Roman Empire. Roman cuisine had borrowed a great deal from the ancient Greeks, but ' (and hence baklava) had a Latin, not a Greek, origin—please note that the conservative, anti-Greek Cato left us this recipe.\\" Andrew Dalby identifies this, and surrounding dessert recipes in Cato, as coming from a \\"Greek tradition\\" and cites Antiphanes (fl. 3rd century BC) as quoted by Athenaeus. Several sources state that this Roman dessert continued to evolve during the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire into modern baklava.John Ash, A Byzantine Journey, [ page 223] In antiquity the Greek word ' () was also used for Latin ',placenta, Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary, on Perseus and the American scholar Speros Vryonis describes one type of plakous, koptoplakous (Byzantine Greek: κοπτοπλακοῦς), as a \\"Byzantine favorite\\" and \\"the same as the Turkish baklava\\",Speros Vryonis The Decline of Medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor, 1971, p. 482 as do other writers.[ Rena Salaman, \\"Food in Motion the Migration of Foodstuffs and Cookery Techniques\\" from the Oxford Symposium on Food Cookery, Vol. 2, p. 184] Indeed, the Roman word placenta () is used today on the island of Lesbos in Greece to describe a baklava-type dessert of layered pastry leaves containing crushed nuts that is baked and then covered in honey.ΠΟΛΙΤΙΣΤΙΚΟ ΙΔΡΥΜΑ ΟΜΙΛΟΥ ΠΕΙΡΑΙΩΣ, ΜΑΓΕΙΡΕΥΟΝΤΑΣ ΜΕ ΛΑΔΙ ΚΑΙ ΑΛΛΑ ΣΤΗΝ ΑΓΙΑ ΠΑΡΑΣΚΕΥΗ ΛΕΣΒΟΥ Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi was a compiler from the Abbasid period who described lauzinaq, a dessert said by some to have been similar to baklava, though others say it was not like baklava.Perry, Charles. \\"What to Order in Ninth Century Baghdad,\\" in Rodinson, Maxime, and Arthur John Arberry. \\"Medieval Arab Cookery.\\" (2001). p. 222 \\"As for lauzinaj, it was not much like baklava.\\" Lauzinaq, which derives from the Aramaic word for almond, refers to small pieces of almond paste wrapped in very thin pastry (\\"as thin as grasshoppers' wings\\") and drenched in syrup.Perry, Charles. \\"What to Order in Ninth Century Baghdad,\\" in Rodinson, Maxime, and Arthur John Arberry. \\"Medieval Arab Cookery.\\" (2001). p. 223 Al-Baghdadi's cookbook, , was written in 1226 (in today's Iraq) and was based on a collection of 9th century Persian-inspired recipes. According to Gil Marks, Middle Eastern pastry makers developed the process of layering the ingredients; he asserts that \\"some scholars said they were influenced by Mongols or Turks\\". The only original manuscript of al- Baghdadi's book survives at the Library in Istanbul (Turkey) and according to Charles Perry, \\"for centuries, it had been the favorite cookbook of the Turks,\\" though Perry also notes that the manuscript has no recipe for baklava. A further 260 recipes had been added to the original by Turkish compilers at an unknown date retitling it as ', and two of its known three copies can be found now at the Topkapı Palace Library in Istanbul. Eventually, Muhammad ibn Mahmud al-Shirwani, the physician of the Ottoman Sultan Murad II prepared a Turkish translation of the book, adding around 70 contemporary recipes. Another recipe for a similar dessert is güllaç, a dessert found in the Turkish cuisine and considered by some as the origin of baklava. It consists of layers of filo dough that are put one by one in warmed up milk with sugar. It is served with walnut and fresh pomegranate and generally eaten during Ramadan. The first known documentation of ' is attested in a food and health manual, written in 1330 that documents Mongol foods called Yinshan Zhengyao (飮膳正要, Important Principles of Food and Drink), written by Hu Sihui, an ethnic Mongol court dietitian of the Yuan dynasty.Paul D.

However, the recipe there is for a filling of nuts and honey, with a top and bottom layer of honey and ground sesame similar to modern ' or ', and no dough, certainly not a flaky dough.Charles Perry, \\"The Taste for Layered Bread among the Nomadic Turks and the Central Asian Origins of Baklava\\", in A Taste of Thyme: Culinary Cultures of the Middle East (ed. Sami Zubaida, Richard Tapper), 1994. . Preparation baking sheets are used for preparing baklava. Baklava is normally prepared in large pans. Many layers of filo dough, separated with melted butter and vegetable oil, are laid in the pan. A layer of chopped nuts—typically walnuts or pistachios, but hazelnuts are also sometimes used—is placed on top, then more layers of filo. Most recipes have multiple layers of filo and nuts, though some have only top and bottom pastry. Before baking (, 30 minutes), the dough is cut into regular pieces, often parallelograms (lozenge-shaped), triangles, diamonds or rectangles. After baking, a syrup, which may include honey, rosewater, or orange flower water is poured over the cooked baklava and allowed to soak in. Baklava is usually served at room temperature, and is often garnished with ground nuts. Baklava, cut in a lozenge shape Regional variations Several types of Baklava Azerbaijanian Baklava Iranian Baklava In Turkey, baklava is traditionally made by filling between the layers of dough with pistachios, walnuts or almonds (in some parts of the Aegean Region). In the Black Sea Region hazelnuts are commonly used as a filling for baklava. Hazelnuts are also used as a filling for the Turkish dessert Sütlü Nuriye, a lighter version of the dessert which substitutes milk for the simple syrup used in traditional baklava recipes. Şöbiyet is a variation that includes fresh cream in the filling, in addition to the traditional nuts. The city of Gaziantep in southeast Turkey is famous for its pistachio baklava. The dessert was introduced to Gaziantep in 1871 by Çelebi Güllü, who had learned the recipe from a chef in Damascus. In 2008, the Turkish patent office registered a geographical indication for Antep Baklava, and in 2013, or was registered as a Protected Geographical Indication by the European Commission. In many parts of Turkey, baklava is often topped with or ice cream. Armenian ' is spiced with cinnamon and cloves.The flower of paradise and other Armenian tales by Bonnie C. Marshall, Virginia A.

In Lebanese, Syrian, Jordanian, Iraqi, Egyptian, Israeli and Palestinian cuisines, baklava prepared from phyllo dough sheets, butter, walnuts and sugar syrup is cut into lozenge-shaped pieces. In the Maghreb, mainly Libyan, Tunisian, Algerian and Moroccan cuisines, the pastry was brought (along many others) by the Ottomans, and is prepared differently depending on the regions and cities. In Iranian cuisine, a drier version of baklava is cooked and presented in smaller diamond-shaped cuts flavored with rose water. The cities of Yazd and Qazvin are famous for their baklava, which is widely distributed in Iran.N. Ramazani, \\"Bāqlavā\\", Encyclopaedia iranica, Volume 3, Issues 5–8, page 729. Persian baklava uses a combination of chopped almonds and pistachios spiced with cardamom and a rose water-scented syrup and is lighter than other Middle Eastern versions.Batmanglij, Najmieh, A Taste of Persia: An Introduction to Persian Cooking, I.B.Tauris, 2007, , 9781845114374; page 156.Food and Booze: A Tin House Literary Feast, Michelle Wildgen, Nicole J.

In the 6th century BCE the most prominent family in the city's political life was the Scopadae,Helly, Bruno. (1995). L'État thesalien, Aleuas le Roux, les tétrades et les tagoi, pp. 107-112 whose numerous flocks and herds grazed in the fertile plain surrounding the city.Theocr. 16.36. Diactorides, one of the Scopadae of Crannon, was a suitor for the hand of the daughter of Cleisthenes of Sicyon. Simonides of Ceos resided some time at Crannon, under the patronage of the Scopadae; and there was a celebrated story current in antiquity respecting the mode in which the Dioscuri preserved the poet's life when the Scopadae were crushed by the falling in of the roof of a building.Cicero de Orat. 2.86. In the first year of the Peloponnesian War (431 BCE) the Crannonians, together with some of the other Thessalians, sent troops to the assistance of the Athenians. In 394 BCE they are mentioned as allies of the Boeotians, who molested Spartan king Agesilaus II in his march through Thessaly on his return from Asia. In 369 BCE the Aleuadae conspired with the inhabitants of Larissa to overthrow the tyrant Alexander of Pherae. They convinced the king of Macedon Alexander II to help them. While the tyrant was busy with the recruitment of troops, Alexander II presented himself with his army in Larissa and seized the city. He then took the acropolis and, afterwards Cranon was won for his cause, and Alexander II presumably established a garrison at Cranon. That garrison was probably withdrawn as was a similar one from Larissa when Pelopidas at the head of the Boeotian forces invited by the Thessalians arrived to liberate their cities and overthrow the tyranny of Alexander of Pherae. After the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BCE), the Phocians fought in Lamia and in the Battle of Crannon against Antipater and his army. This was the decisive battle of the Lamian War between Macedon and Athens with its allies. In 191 BCE, Crannon was taken by Selecuid king Antiochus III. It is mentioned again in the war with Perseus of Macedon. Catullus speaks of it as a declining place in his time (first century BCE): \\"Deseritur Scyros: linquunt Phthiotica Tempe, Cranonisque domos, ac moenia Larissaea.\\"Catullus, 64.35. Its name occurs in Pliny. In a stele of the first century BCE, an inscription related to a certain Polixenus, son of Minomachus, appears in an act of emancipation at Cranon as a strategos and as a manumitor. As he liberates a slave in this city and the inscription does not specify his ethnicity, Bruno Helly deduces that he was from Cranon,Bruno Helly. “Le groupe des monnaies fédérales thessaliennes avec Athéna «aux pompons».” Revue numismatique, 6e série - Tome 8, (1966), pp. 11-12. contradicting the opinion of Friedrich Stählin,F.

Archaeology There are ruins of Cranon at a place called Palealarissa, in the modern municipal unit of Krannonas. At an indeterminate date Cranon was a walled and fortified city, but almost nothing is known about the urban centre and the acropolis, except for a possible temple of Athena Polias erected on it.Arvanitopoulos. (1922-1924) Περί τῶν ὲν Κραννὦνι Θεσσαλίαϛ δοκιμαστικὦν, p. 37 There were also temples of Aesclepius, Apollo, Poseidon and Zeus.IG ix.2.461. The city minted silver coins in the fifth century BCE (480-400 BCE) and bronze coins in the fourth century BCE. Drachmas, tetrobols, triobols, obols and hemiobols of the Aeginan type have been preserved, with the legend ΚΡΑ or ΚΡΑΝ or ΚΡΑΝΟ.Rogers, E. (1932). The Copper Coinage of Thessaly, pp. 179-204.

This is critically important because it allows farmers and geneticists to predict whether a crop or animal will have a desired trait, and to what extent the trait will be expressed. He developed mixed model equations to obtain best linear unbiased predictions of breeding values and, in general, any random effect. He invented three methods for the estimation of variance components in unbalanced settings of mixed models, and invented a method for constructing the inverse of Wright's numerator relationship matrix based on a simple list of pedigree information. He, with his Ph.D. student Shayle R. Searle, greatly extended the use of matrix notation in statistics. His methods are widely used by the domestic livestock industry throughout the world and are a cornerstone of linear model theory. Henderson obtained his B.Sc., M.Sc.(nutrition) and Ph.D.(breeding) degrees at Iowa State University, where he was a student of Professor L. N. Hazel. Henderson joined the faculty of the Department of Animal Science at Cornell University in 1948, and headed the Animal Breeding division for nearly 30 years until he retired in 1976. After retiring from Cornell, he was a visiting professor at the University of Guelph and University of Illinois until his death. He completed his book in 1984 at the University of Guelph.

Over the course of the conflict, Kurdish factions from Iranian and Turkish Kurdistan, as well as Iranian, Iraqi and Turkish state forces, were drawn into the fighting, with additional involvement from American forces. Between 3,000 and 5,000 fighters and civilians were killed. Background Autonomy in Iraqi Kurdistan was originally established in 1970 as the Kurdish Autonomous Region following the agreement of an Autonomy Accord between the government of Iraq and leaders of the Iraqi Kurdish community. A Legislative Assembly was established in the city of Erbil with nominal authority over the Kurdish- populated governorates of Erbil, Dahuk and As Sulaymaniyah. As various battles between separatist Kurds and Iraqi government forces continued until the 1991 uprisings in Iraq, the safety of Kurdish refugees led to the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 688 which was used as a justification to implement Operation Provide Comfort, a US-led multinational military operation that ensured the security of the Iraqi Kurdish region through the use of air power while simultaneously providing humanitarian aid to refugees fleeing persecution.L. Fawcett, Down but not out? The Kurds in International Politics, Reviews of International Studies, Vol.27, 2001 p.117 While the no-fly zone covered Dahuk and Erbil, it left out Sulaymaniyah and Kirkuk. This led to a further series of bloody clashes between Iraqi government forces and Kurdish troops. Shortly thereafter, an uneasy balance of power was reached, and Iraq withdrew its military and government officials from the region in October 1991. From that point on, Iraqi Kurdistan had achieved de facto independence under the leadership of the region's two principal Kurdish parties – the Kurdish Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan – free from the control of Baghdad. The region then adopted its own flag and national anthem. Iraqi Kurdistan held parliamentary elections in 1992. The KDP gained an absolute majority of the votes in the governorates of Dohuk and Arbil, whereas the PUK garnered the broad support of the Sulaymaniyah governorate as well as the Kurdish portions of Diyala (specifically the Kifri and Khanaqin Districts). As a result of the election, the Kurdish parliament was split between Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and Massoud Barzani's Kurdish Democratic Party. After withdrawing its forces from Kurdistan in October 1991, the Iraqi government imposed an economic blockade over the region, restricting its oil and food supplies.M. Leezenberg, Iraqi Kurdistan: contours of a post-civil war society, Third World Quarterly, Vol.26, No.4-5, June 2005, p.636 The United Nations embargo on Iraq also significantly affected the Kurdish economy, preventing trade between the Kurds and other nations. As such, all economic dealings between Iraqi Kurdistan and the outside world were done through the black market. In March 1994 Turkish Armed Forces began Operation Steel, a cross-border military incursion into northern Iraq against the PKK. On May 3 a delegation from the KDP agreed to not allow the PKK to have a base in northern Iraq. On May 4, Turkish Armed Forces left northern Iraq. 1994 PUK–KDP clashes Fighting broke out between the two factions in May 1994. The initial clashes left around 300 people dead and over the next year, around 2,000 people were killed on both sides. According to former CIA officer Robert Baer, members of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps provided limited support to the PDK and allowed the PDK to launch attacks from Iranian territory, attacking Penjwin and Qaladze on two separate occasions, as until 1996 the PDK had closer relations with Iran than the PUK, before Iran started supporting the PUK after they had allowed them to bombard Iranian Kurdish parties residing in Koya. Planned assassination of Saddam Hussein In January 1995, CIA case officer Robert Baer traveled to northern Iraq with a five-man team to set up a CIA station. He made contact with the Kurdish leadership and managed to negotiate a truce between Barzani and Talabani. Within days, Baer made contact with an Iraqi general who was plotting to assassinate Saddam Hussein. The plan was to use a unit of 100 renegade Iraqi troops to kill Saddam as he passed over a bridge near Tikrit. Baer cabled the plan to Washington but did not hear anything back. After three weeks, the plan was revised, calling for an attack by Kurdish forces in northern Iraq while rebel Iraqi troops leveled one of Saddam's houses with tank fire in order to kill the Iraqi leader. Baer again cabled the plan to Washington and received no response. On 28 February, the Iraqi Army was placed on full alert. In response, the Iranian and Turkish militaries were also placed on high alert. Baer received a message directly from National Security Advisor Tony Lake telling him his operation was compromised. This warning was passed on Baer's Kurdish and Iraqi contacts. Upon learning this, Barzani backed out of the planned offensive, leaving Talabani's PUK forces to carry it out alone. The Iraqi Army officers planning to kill Saddam with tank fire were compromised, arrested and executed before they could carry out the operation. The PUK's offensive was still launched as planned, and within days they managed to destroy three Iraqi Army divisions and capture 5,000 prisoners.Robert Baer speech at World Media Association Despite Baer's pleas for American support of the offensive, none was forthcoming, and the Kurdish troops were forced to withdraw. Baer was immediately recalled from Iraq, briefly investigated for the attempted murder of Saddam Hussein, but exonerated. Battle of Erbil (1996) Although the Kurdish parliament ceased to meet in May 1996, the fragile cease-fire between the PUK and KDP held until the summer of 1996. During this period, the Iraqi government was permitted by the KDP to establish a smuggling route through the Khabur River basin for the transportation of illegal petroleum exports. Barzani and his associates seized the opportunity to impose taxation on this trade, giving them an income of several million dollars per week. This led to a dispute with the PUK over who should benefit from this money. Although the two parties reached an agreement where the Iraqi–Turkish smuggling routes would be divided evenly between them, the KDP continued its attempts to exert greater control over the movement of goods through Iraqi Kurdistan. Talabani established an alliance with Iran, permitting it to conduct a military incursion into northern Iraq aimed at the Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran on 28 July. In response, Barzani asked for assistance from the Iraqi government who, seeing an opportunity to retake northern Iraq, accepted. On 31 August, 30,000 Iraqi troops, spearheaded by an armored division of the Iraqi Republican Guard, attacked the PUK-held city of Erbil, which was defended by 3,000 PUK Peshmerga led by Korsat Rasul Ali, in conjunction with KDP forces. Erbil was captured, and Iraqi troops executed 700 PUK and Iraqi National Congress prisoners of war in a field outside the city. This attack stoked Kurdish fears that Saddam intended to launch a genocidal campaign against the Kurds similar to the campaigns of 1988 and 1991. The Clinton administration, unwilling to allow the Iraqi government to regain control of Iraqi Kurdistan, began Operation Desert Strike on 3 September, when American ships and B-52 Stratofortress bombers launched 27 cruise missiles at air defense sites in southern Iraq. The next day, 17 more cruise missiles were launched from American ships against Iraqi air defense sites. The United States also deployed strike aircraft and an aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf region, and the extent of the southern no-fly zone was moved northwards to the 33rd parallel. After installing the KDP in control of Erbil, Iraqi Army troops withdrew from the Kurdish region back to their initial positions. The KDP drove the PUK from its other strongholds, and with additional Iraqi Army help, captured Sulaymaniyah on 9 September. Jalal Talabani and the PUK retreated to the Iranian border, and American forces evacuated 700 Iraqi National Congress personnel and 6,000 PUK members out of northern Iraq. On 13 October, Sulaymaniyah was recaptured by the PUK, allegedly with support of Iranian forces. Turkish intervention Fighting continued throughout the winter between the KDP and PUK. Complicating matters, PKK was present in Iraq. PKK was allied with the PUK which later led KDP attack the PKK. According to some sources, the PKK began to fight against all who supported KDP, including some Assyrian and Arab groups. Turkey which saw the Kurdish Civil war as an opportunity, allied with KDP and launched Operation Hammer in May, in a violent attempt to force the PKK to leave Iraqi Kurdistan. This operation caused heavy PKK casualties but was unsuccessful. PKK succeeded to keep their camps in Northern Iraq. On 25 September 1997, Turkish forces re-entered Iraqi Kurdistan and attacked PUK and PKK positions in an attempt to force the PKK to leave Iraqi Kurdistan. However, according to Turkish sources, it was an attempt to bring a cease-fire between the factions. The operation resulted in heavy PKK and PUK casualties. Later a cease-fire was negotiated between the PUK and KDP after the US decision to support a cease-fire. Despite the cease- fire, renewed fighting broke out along the armistice line between the KDP and PUK in October and November. In this round of fighting, 1,200 combatants were killed on both sides and 10,000 civilians fled their homes. On 24 November 1997, the KDP declared a unilateral cease-fire. The PUK, although not declaring a cease-fire officially, said their group would respect the truce, despite alleging that the KDP had violated the truce by attacking PUK positions on 25 November. Aftermath Division of Kurdistan after the civil war In September 1998, Barzani and Talabani signed the U.S.-mediated Washington Agreement establishing a formal peace treaty. In the agreement, the parties agreed to share revenue, share power, deny the use of northern Iraq to the PKK, and not allow Iraqi troops into the Kurdish regions. The United States pledged to use military force to protect the Kurds from possible aggression by Saddam Hussein. At the same time, implementation of the U.N. Oil-for-Food Programme brought revenue to northern Iraq, allowing for increased standards of living. Iraqi Kurdistan became a relatively peaceful region, before the small terrorist group Ansar al-Islam entered the Halabja region in December 2001, bringing renewed conflict that would end in 2003 immediately prior to start of Iraq war, which mainly affected non-Kurdish areas of Iraq. Around a month later, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act into law, providing for military assistance to Iraqi opposition groups, including the PUK and KDP. The KDP estimated that 58,000 of its supporters had been expelled from PUK-controlled regions from October 1996 to October 1997. The PUK says 49,000 of its supporters were expelled from KDP- controlled regions from August 1996 to December 1997. The PUK and KDP later co-operated with American forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, routing Iraqi forces with the help of American air power and overrunning much of northern Iraq including the cities of Kirkuk and Mosul. After the invasion, Massoud Barzani was later elected president of Iraqi Kurdistan while Jalal Talabani was elected President of Iraq.

Other than one appearance for the Players in 1931, all his games were for Worcestershire. Before beginning his first-class career, Nichol had played at minor counties level for Durham. He also had a trial for Surrey, Obituary. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 1934. but in 1928 (having not yet qualified to play in the County Championship) he made his first-class debut for Worcestershire against the touring West Indians at Worcester. Nichol achieved the feat of a hundred on debut by hitting 104, sharing in a stand of 207 with Harold Gibbons. From 1929 onward, Nichol could play regularly for his county, and in that first full year he managed over 1,400 runs including two centuries and eight fifties. However, 1930 was to prove a more successful season: over the course of the summer he hit five hundreds and seven fifties, including what was to remain the highest score of his career, an unbeaten 262 against Hampshire at Dean Park, Bournemouth. By 1931 there was talk that he might become good enough to play for England, and indeed he was twelfth man at the Lord's Test against New Zealand that summer, although he never actually gained a Test cap. He did, however, appear for the Players—also at Lord's—though he failed, making just 4 in his only innings. Although he made more than 1,300 runs in 1931, he struck only one century, and that winter he was struck down with pneumonia and was in hospital for several weeks. Although he returned to play in the 1932 season, his form was (perhaps understandably) poor, and he made only five half- centuries and well under 800 runs in the summer. 1933 was another matter entirely, and proved to be Nichol's best. He hit eight hundreds and 11 fifties, and passed 2,000 runs for the season for the only time, finishing with 2,154 at an average of nearly 44. After a string of frustrations in August, when he repeatedly got a start only to be dismissed before making a really large score, he ended the summer in splendid style, scoring centuries in his last three innings. The sequence began with 116 against Hampshire, and this was followed by 165 not out versus Glamorgan. Finally, he hit 154 against Yorkshire. 1933 was also the only year in which Nichol's bowling counted for anything much: he took 16 of his 21 wickets that season bowling googlies. The 1934 season began rather poorly for Nichol, and after four matches and eight innings he had totaled only 57 runs. He was not to get the chance to make amends: on the second day of the game against Essex at Chelmsford he was found dead in his bed in the Saracen's Head Hotel. His death was discovered by a chambermaid of the hotel at nine in the morning. Nichol had played golf on the previous day (which, being a Sunday, was a rest day) and engaged in wrestling with fellow players till about midnight. On the next day, the players wore black armbands. Before the start of play, the teams assembled in the ground. The players and the crowd stood bareheaded and in silence for two minutes before the match resumed at 11:30. Five Durham cricketers acted as his pall- bearers. At the inquest his death was put down to heart disease, following double pneumonia two years earlier. A post-mortem examination disclosed an abnormally large heart that the doctor said made it almost unbelievable that Nichol lived such a long active life. Nichol was engaged to be married to Dorothy Ayers. NotesReferences Martin Williamson, Absent ..

Kamenjak peninsula is 3400 m long, wide between 500–1200 m and includes 30 km of coastline, beautiful bays and beaches, many protected and endemic plant and animal species such as: endemic orchids, butterflies, Mediterranean monk seal, crabs and more. The best evidence about the ancient history of Premantura Kamenjak are the 146 dinosaur footprints found on Kamenjak that are more than 90 million years old.

The group was originally constructed by Grigorchuk in a 1980 paper and he then proved in a 1984 paper that this group has intermediate growth, thus providing an answer to an important open problem posed by John Milnor in 1968. The Grigorchuk group remains a key object of study in geometric group theory, particularly in the study of the so-called branch groups and automata groups, and it has important connections with the theory of iterated monodromy groups.Volodymyr Nekrashevych. Self-similar groups. Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, 117. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2005. . History and significance The growth of a finitely generated group measures the asymptotics, as n \\\\to \\\\infty of the size of an n-ball in the Cayley graph of the group (that is, the number of elements of G that can be expressed as words of length at most n in the generating set of G). The study of growth rates of finitely generated groups goes back to the 1950s and is motivated in part by the notion of volume entropy (that is, the growth rate of the volume of balls) in the universal covering space of a compact Riemannian manifold in differential geometry. It is obvious that the growth rate of a finitely generated group is at most exponential and it was also understood early on that finitely generated nilpotent groups have polynomial growth. In 1968 John Milnor posed a questionJohn Milnor, Problem No. 5603, American Mathematical Monthly, vol. 75 (1968), pp. 685-686. about the existence of a finitely generated group of intermediate growth, that is, faster than any polynomial function and slower than any exponential function. An important result in the subject is Gromov's theorem on groups of polynomial growth, obtained by Gromov in 1981, which shows that a finitely generated group has polynomial growth if and only if this group has a nilpotent subgroup of finite index. Prior to Grigorchuk's work, there were many results establishing growth dichotomy (that is, that the growth is always either polynomial or exponential) for various classes of finitely generated groups, such as linear groups, solvable groups,John Milnor. Growth of finitely generated solvable groups. Journal of Differential Geometry. vol. 2 (1968), pp. 447-449.Joseph Rosenblatt. Invariant Measures and Growth Conditions, Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, vol. 193 (1974), pp. 33-53. etc. Grigorchuk's group G was constructed in a 1980 paper of Rostislav Grigorchuk,R. I. Grigorchuk. On Burnside's problem on periodic groups. (Russian) Funktsionalyi Analiz i ego Prilozheniya, vol. 14 (1980), no. 1, pp. 53-54. where he proved that this group is infinite, periodic and residually finite. In a subsequent 1984 paperR. I. Grigorchuk, Degrees of growth of finitely generated groups and the theory of invariant means. Izvestiya Akademii Nauk SSSR. Seriya Matematicheskaya. vol. 48 (1984), no. 5, pp. 939-985. Grigorchuk proved that this group has intermediate growth (this result was announced by Grigorchuk in 1983). More precisely, he proved that G has growth b(n) that is faster than \\\\exp(\\\\sqrt n) but slower than \\\\exp(n^s) where s=\\\\log_{32}31\\\\approx 0.991. The upper bound was later improved by Laurent BartholdiLaurent Bartholdi. Lower bounds on the growth of a group acting on the binary rooted tree.

The precise asymptotics of the growth of G is still unknown. It is conjectured that the limit :\\\\lim_{n\\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\log_n \\\\log b(n), exists but even this remains a major open problem. Grigorchuk's group was also the first example of a group that is amenable but not elementary amenable, thus answering a problem posed by Mahlon Day in 1957.Mahlon M. Day. Amenable semigroups. Illinois Journal of Mathematics, vol. 1 (1957), pp. 509-544. Originally, Grigorchuk's group G was constructed as a group of Lebesgue-measure-preserving transformations on the unit interval, but subsequently simpler descriptions of G were found and it is now usually presented as a group of automorphisms of the infinite regular binary rooted tree. The study of Grigorchuk's group informed in large part the development of the theory of branch groups, automata groups and self-similar groups in the 1990s-2000s and Grigorchuk's group remains a central object in this theory. Recently important connections between this theory and complex dynamics, particularly the notion of iterated monodromy groups, have been uncovered in the work of Volodymyr Nekrashevych.Volodymyr Nekrashevych, Self-similar groups. Mathematical Surveys and Monographs, 117. American Mathematical Society, Providence, RI, 2005. . and others. After Grigorchuk's 1984 paper, there were many subsequent extensions and generalizations.Roman Muchnik, and Igor Pak. On growth of Grigorchuk groups.

Definition The infinite binary tree T2. Its nodes are labeled by strings of 0s and 1s. Although initially the Grigorchuk group was defined as a group of Lebesgue measure-preserving transformations of the unit interval, at present this group is usually given by its realization as a group of automorphisms of the infinite regular binary rooted tree T2. The tree T2 is realized as the set \\\\Sigma^* of all finite strings in the alphabet \\\\Sigma = {0, 1} plus the empty string \\\\varnothing which is the root vertex of T2. For a vertex x of T2 the string x0 is the left child of x and the string x1 is the right child of x in T2. The group of all automorphisms Aut(T2) can thus be thought of as the group of all length-preserving permutations σ of \\\\Sigma^* that also respect the initial segment relation, that is such that whenever a string x is an initial segment of a string y then σ(x) is an initial segment of σ(y). The Grigorchuk group G is then defined as the subgroup of Aut(T2) generated by four specific elements of Aut(T2): : G = \\\\langle a, b, c, d \\\\rangle \\\\leqslant \\\\text{Aut}(T_2), where the automorphisms a, b, c, d are defined as follows (note that \\\\varnothing is fixed by all automorphisms of the tree): :\\\\begin{align} a(0) = 1, \\\\qquad a(1) = 0, \\\\qquad \\\\forall x \\\\in \\\\Sigma^*\\\\quad &\\\\begin{cases} a(0x) = 1x \\\\ a(1x) =0x \\\\end{cases} \\\\ [6pt] \\\\begin{align} &b;(0) = c(0) = d(0) = 0 \\\\ &b;(1) = c(1) = d(1) = 1 \\\\end{align} \\\\qquad \\\\forall x \\\\in \\\\Sigma^*\\\\quad &\\\\begin{align} &\\\\begin{cases} b(0x) = 0a(x) \\\\ b(1x) = 1c(x) \\\\end{cases} \\\\ &\\\\begin{cases} c(0x) = 0a(x) \\\\ c(1x) = 1d(x) \\\\end{cases} \\\\ &\\\\begin{cases} d(0x) = 0x \\\\ d(1x) = 1b(x)\\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} \\\\end{align} The action of the standard generating set of the Grigorchuk group on the tree T2. The triangles denote the infinite subtrees that remain unchanged. We see that only the element a is defined explicitly and the elements b, c, d are defined recursively. To get a better picture of this action we note that T_2 has a natural gradation into levels given by the length of the strings: :\\\\begin{align} &\\\\ell = 0 \\\\qquad \\\\varnothing \\\\ &\\\\ell = 1 \\\\qquad 0, 1 \\\\ &\\\\ell = 2 \\\\qquad 00, 01, 10, 11 \\\\ &\\\\qquad \\\\cdots \\\\end{align} Now let T[n] denote the union of all vertices with level \\\\leqslant n. This means: :\\\\begin{align} T[0] & = {\\\\varnothing} \\\\ T[1] & = {\\\\varnothing, 0, 1} \\\\ T[2] &= {\\\\varnothing, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11 } \\\\ &\\\\quad \\\\cdots \\\\end{align} Since automorphisms of the tree are length-preserving, T[n] as a set is fixed by \\\\text{Aut}(T_2) for all n \\\\geqslant 0. With this in mind we write: : T_2 = 0\\\\Sigma^* \\\\sqcup T[1] \\\\sqcup 1\\\\Sigma^*. We call 0\\\\Sigma^* (resp. 1\\\\Sigma^*) the left (resp. right) branch and denote it by T_L (resp. T_R). With this notation we see that: : a(T_L) \\\\subseteq T_R, \\\\quad a(T_R) \\\\subseteq T_L. Now we can also write the action of the elements b, c and d in terms of the disjoint union as follows: : \\\\begin{align} b :=(a,c) \\\\quad &\\\\Longleftrightarrow \\\\quad b(x) = \\\\begin{cases} a(x) & x \\\\in T_L \\\\ c(x) & x \\\\in T_R \\\\end{cases} \\\\ c :=(a,d) \\\\quad &\\\\Longleftrightarrow \\\\quad c(x) = \\\\begin{cases} a(x) & x \\\\in T_L \\\\ d(x) & x \\\\in T_R \\\\end{cases} \\\\ d :=(\\\\text{id},b) \\\\quad &\\\\Longleftrightarrow \\\\quad d(x) = \\\\begin{cases} x & x \\\\in T_L \\\\ b(x) & x \\\\in T_R \\\\end{cases} \\\\end{align} Similarly we have: : aba = (c, a), \\\\quad aca = (d, a), \\\\quad ada = (b, \\\\text{id}). Properties The following are basic algebraic properties of the Grigorchuk group (seePierre de la Harpe. Topics in geometric group theory. Chicago Lectures in Mathematics. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. ; Ch. VIII, The first Grigorchuk group, pp. 211-264. for proofs): *The group G is infinite. *The group G is residually finite. Let \\\\rho_n : G \\\\to \\\\text{Aut}(T[n]) be the restriction homomorphism that sends every element of G to its restriction to the finite tree T[n]. The groups Aut(T[n]) are finite and for every nontrivial g in G there exists n such that \\\\rho_n (g) eq 1. *The group G is generated by a and any two of the three elements b,c,d. For example, we can write G = \\\\langle a, b, c\\\\rangle. *The elements a, b, c, d are involutions. *The elements b, c, d pairwise commute and bc = cb = d, bd = db = c, dc = cd = b, so that \\\\langle b, c, d \\\\rangle \\\\leqslant G is an abelian group of order 4 isomorphic to the direct product of two cyclic groups of order 2. *Combining the previous two properties we see that every element of G can be written as a (positive) word in a, b, c, d such that this word does not contain any subwords of the form aa, bb, cc, dd, cd, dc, bc, cb, bd, db. Such words are called reduced. *The group G is a 2-group, that is, every element in G has finite order that is a power of 2. *The group G has intermediate growth. *The group G is amenable but not elementary amenable. *The group G is just infinite, that is G is infinite but every proper quotient group of G is finite. *The group G has the congruence subgroup property: a subgroup H has finite index in G if and only if there is a positive integer n such that \\\\ker(\\\\rho_n) \\\\leqslant H. *The group G has solvable subgroup membership problem, that is, there is an algorithm that, given arbitrary words w, u1, ..., un decides whether or not w represents an element of the subgroup generated by u1, ..., un. *The group G is subgroup separable, that is, every finitely generated subgroup is closed in the pro-finite topology on G.R.

Retitled Wowser, the series aired in 1989 on The Family Channel. The dub changed the names of the characters and replaced the original music and also had some scenes removed or edited due to their violent or sexual manner, such as one scene in \\"The Hip Hippos\\" where Dingy beats Wowser on the head, and another scene in \\"Slap Happy Birthday\\" where a chicken attacks Beatrice, causing her to crash and rip and ruin her dress. In \\"Self-Cleaning Machine\\", when Dingy's vaccum backfires when Linda's clothes fly out the window and land in parts of town, a bra lands on a male statue's chest and he covers himself. The whole scene was censored with the statue covering himself. In the UK, it aired on ITV and later on Channel 4 in the early and mid 1990s, and two videos of the series were released in two volumes. In the U.S. in 1990 and 1991, the videos of the Wowser series were released in four volumes, and also in episodes of the running time of 30 minutes and 60 minutes. In Canada, it aired on YTV between 1990 and 1993. The series were also dubbed to Arabic in Jordan, and released throughout many countries of the Arab world. This version was named Ka'abool (Arabic: كعبول). The series was also dubbed in Euskera, titled as \\"Dommel artzain txakurra\\" (Dommel the Shepherd Dog). The series was also dubbed in Dutch, titled as Dommel and aired by BRT, VARA and Kindernet from 1989 to 2003 and when Kindernet relaunched as Nickelodeon Kindernet on Comedy Central (Netherlands) from May 2011 up until the block ended on 31 October 2013.

Born in Wood Green, England, he served with Royal Air Force in World War II before competing in the 10,000 metre event at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Unable to participate in the 1950 British Empire Games, he returned to the Olympics in 1952, although he did not complete his event, the marathon, due to the flu. At the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games, he suffered a sunstroke and collapsed within two miles (3 km) of the finish. He retired from running in 1956, but continued to work with UK Athletics for several years and was due to participate in the ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics. Early life Cox was born on 15 July 1918 in Wood Green, England and began his professional running career in 1939. During World War II, he served in Iraq with the Royal Air Force. After returning to competition shape and qualifying, Cox was only allowed two days off work for the 1948 Summer Olympics, one to observe the opening ceremonies and a second actually to compete. Olympic career In 1948, Cox was the British six mile (10 km) champion, with a time of approximately 29 minutes. In the Men's 10,000 metres competition, he did not receive a medal, placing 7th. He later claimed that he was told by 1924 Olympian Harold Abrahams that he had run an extra lap due to confusion caused by Emil Zátopek, and should have placed 5th instead. In 1952, he was due to compete in the marathon event, but after riding in a drafty aeroplane to the competition, he awoke the day of the race with a paralysed left side. It was later discovered that he was suffering from the flu. Cox was a Great Britain International from 1939–1956. He had qualified for the 1950 British Empire Games, but his employers threatened to fire him if he attended, so he remained at home. He did, however, compete in the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games in the marathon event, but did not receive a medal. During the race he, along with fellow athlete Jim Peters, was afflicted with severe hyperthermia and was taken to hospital after running into a post, with only two miles remaining. His personal best time in the marathon was 2 hours and 18 minutes. Later life After retiring from running in 1956, he worked as a judge with British Amateur Athletics Association. During his tenure at this job, he was hit by a javelin while judging the throw of another competitor, an incident that nearly killed him. Cox, who lived in Felixstowe for nearly 30 years, was seeking to take an active part in the 2012 Summer Olympics and a campaign began to make him a participant in the games' ceremonies. He led a weekly walk group to remain fit and active, walking an average of four miles (6 km) a day, until a year before his death on 27 June 2012.

On leaving school Everett became an organiser with County Wicklow Agricultural Union, which later merged with the ITGWU. He was a member of Sinn Féin and served as a justice in the Republican courts for Kildare and Wicklow from 1919. He was first elected to Dáil Éireann in 1923 as a Labour Party TD for Wicklow. Everett was one of the six TDs who left the Labour Party in 1944 because of its alleged infiltration by communists, and formed the National Labour Party. Everett became the leader of the new party.  Career  In 1948 the National Labour Party joined the Cabinet of John A. Costello in the First Inter-Party Government and Everett was appointed Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. In 1950 Everett, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs became involved in a bizarre incident known as the \\"Battle of Baltinglass.\\" Everett appointed Michael Farrell as sub-postmaster in the local post office. The office had been run by Helen Cooke for her invalid aunt, whose family had held the position since 1870. Local feeling ran high in support of Cooke, with telegraph poles being cut to prove their point. Allegations of political jobbery were denied but Everett's actions became a national issue. Farrell resigned in December 1950 and Everett bowed to the pressure and appointed Cooke. It is believed that the Baltinglass affair contributed to the downfall of the Inter-Party government in 1951.A Dictionary of Irish History, D.J.Hickey & J.E.Doherty, Gill and Macmillan, Dublin, 1980. Pp. page 25. Also in 1950, during the First Inter-Party Government's tenure, the Labour Party and the National Labour Party reunited. Everett served in government again between 1954 and 1957 as Minister for Justice and in that capacity he granted Albert Luykx Irish citizenship. Everett died aged 78, during the 1967 Dáil Christmas Recess, when with 44 years service as a TD, he was joint Father of the Dáil with Frank Aiken and Paddy Smith.

Licensed to Celina, Ohio, United States, the station serves the Lima area. The station is currently owned by The Sonshine Communications Corporation. In December 2006, the station changed to the current classic hits format from its former adult contemporary format.  History  The station was founded in 1960 as WMER, a reference to MERcer County, making it the county's first commercial radio station, transmitting with only 740 watts from its studios located above The Celina Music Store at 128 West Fayette Street in downtown Celina. The music store's owner at the time was also the original owner of WMER. As the weak signal and short transmitting tower in back of the music store barely covered Mercer County with neighboring Auglaize County being the fringe area, there was a demand for a more powerful station, hence WCSM AM and FM later emerged as a competitor in 1964 along with the former WERM located west of Wapakoneta at Moulton (which is now WFGF \\"The Frog\\" with studios in Lima.) The Fayette Street studios remain in use today. The station changed ownership several different times during the 1970s; it was a sister station to WDRK in Greenville (now WRZX) from 1968 until 1972 under the ownership of Lee Rutherford and Ron Rumley airing Drake-Chenault's \\"Hitparade\\" adult contemporary automation tapes. Later in that same year, the station was later owned by the Hildebrand family (as WMER Incorporated) and played Top 40 music. Scott Hillebrand (air name: Scott Allen) managed the station and was chief DJ. Despite the owner's good intentions, it fell into receivership in 1973 (possibly due to financial problems coupled with its then-low power signal and limited coverage area), prompting a sale. A group of area business people formed a partnership called Grand Lake Broadcasting in an effort to purchase the station and tentatively move it to a newer building on State Route 703 near Grand Lake St. Marys and apply for a power increase with a more efficient tower but the deal fell through with the partnership quickly dissolved. By the spring of 1974 it was finally sold, with the new owners Keith and Jackie Balfour (previously with WCSM) flipping the format to adult standards. 1978 brought another ownership change, this time being Michigan-based Mid-America Radio Inc. with another format change (to country music), and a change in calls to WKKI. The \\"K-94\\" nickname was first used for the country format until 1979, which brought yet another format change, to a soft AC daytime/album oriented rock nighttime mix. In 1979 the station was finally upgraded to a much more powerful 3,000 watts and the transmitter moved to a higher tower near the West Ohio Branch Campus of Wright State University at Grand Lake St. Marys (which is also the transmitting tower of W17AA, the Celina translator of Dayton's public television station WPTD). The station switched to a full-time album-oriented rock format in 1983 by a new owner, Cage Media, headed up by Chris Cage, a former WING \\"Lively Guy\\" and University of Dayton graduate. The station was heavily involved with bringing concerts to the Ohio Theater in Lima. The format also gave the station opportunities to promote major concerts at other venues. Branded as \\"94-KKI\\", the AOR format lasted until early 1983 when the K-94 branding was revived and used, this time as the local affiliate of Transtar, one of the first satellite format programming services, again airing Adult Contemporary music. The K-94 branding remains today under its present owner with a mix of classic and contemporary rock and roll as its current format in addition to local high school sports coverage.

She began her career as operatic soprano Margaret Fitzgibbon with the Tivoli Circuit in 1946 before graduating to radio 2GB with Jack Davey. Around 1950 she started developing as a solo cabaret performer in Sydney's main night clubs and during this period she changed her performing name to Maggie. She was spotted there by Sir Frank Tait of J.C. Williamsons, who offered her the featured role of Bianca in the 1952 Australian production of Kiss Me Kate, in which she appeared with Hayes Gordon. Maggie then left for the United Kingdom and was soon cast as Principal Boy in the Aladdin pantomime at Blackpool, opposite Hylda Baker who played Widow Twankey. Then came a twelve months tour with Flanagan and Allen in The Crazy Gang. Her own cabaret act followed at The Astor, The Stork Room, The Pigalle Club and, in 1956, Winston's Club with Danny La Rue. More cabarets, stage musicals and plays came along (including playing the role of Jane in a 1960 London revival of Rudolf Friml's Rose Marie, for which she recreated the role in a studio cast recording the following year) until, in 1961 she appeared opposite Max Bygraves in the musical Do Re Mi. Fitzgibbon appeared on various British television dramas such as Danger Man. The BBC cast her in the starring role of Vivienne Cooper in their TV series The NewcomersNostalgia Central - The Newcomers which ran from 1965 to 1969. This led to her own show for London Weekend Television Maggie's Place and with guest appearances such as Benny Hill and Morecambe and Wise. She also played a leading role as Adelaide in LWT's 1970 26-part wartime drama Manhunt, and appeared in the 1972 film Sunstruck opposite Harry Secombe. She returned to Australia briefly in 1963 to star in Noël Coward's Australian production of his musical Sail Away, then returning to London to star with Bob Monkhouse and Ronnie Corbett in the Drury Lane production of The Boys from Syracuse (Luce).London Cast Recording. The Boys from Syracuse. Decca Record Company Limited, 1963. LK 4564. Her final West End appearance was in Side By Side By Sondheim after which she retired to farm in Australia, making only occasional guest appearances, mainly on the concert stage. In 2002 she was awarded an OAM for services to the community. Fitzgibbon was featured in the Victorian Jazz Archive exhibition entitled The Fitzgibbon Dynasty.

It was demolished for building materials in 1805 and almost nothing of it remains today. It lay south of Chinon and west of Sainte- Maure de Touraine, just south of what is now Richelieu, Indre-et-Loire, surrounded by mostly agricultural land. Built between 1631 and 1642 on the site of the former du Plessis family mansion, the château was at the heart of a several-hectare park located south of the current city. The site was designated a historical monument in September 1930. History The château, along with a new model village ( \\"new town\\"), was built at the order of Richelieu, who had spent his youth there and bought the village of his ancestors; he had the estate raised to a duché-pairie in August 1631. He engaged the architect Jacques Lemercier, who had designed the Sorbonne and the Cardinal's hôtel in Paris, the Palais Cardinal (now the Palais-Royal). With the permission of King Louis XIII, Richelieu created from scratch a walled town on a grid arrangement, and, enclosing within its precincts the modest home of his childhood, an adjacent palace (the Château de Richelieu proper)The château was engraved (see illustration below) by Jean Marot, La magnifique chasteau de Richelieu, about 1660; it is unlikely that essential changes had been made since the Cardinal's death. The château was described, on the basis of Marot's engraving, by H. Carrington Lancaster, \\"The Chateau de Richelieu and Desmaretz's Visionnaires\\" Modern Language Notes 60.3 (March 1945:167-172) on which the present description is based. surrounded by an ornamental moat and large imposing walls enclosing a series of entrance courts towards the town and, on the opposite side, grand axially-planned formal vista gardens of parterres and gravel walks, a central circular fountain, and views reaching to an exedra cut in the surrounding trees and pierced by an avenue in the woodlands extending to the horizon. The pleasure grounds were enclosed in woodland;SMarot's engraving preserves the layout of the gardens in detail. since their innovative example was followed and extended at Vaux-le-Vicomte and in the gardens of Versailles, and since André Le Nôtre's father was employed at Richelieu in 1629, it is not improbable that the young boy was employed as well.Derek Clifford, A History of Garden Design 1963 fig. 26 facing p. 65. Construction took place between 1631 and 1642 – the year of the Cardinal's death – and employed around 2,000 workers. At the Château de Richelieu, the Cardinal maintained one of the largest art collections in Europe and the largest collection of ancient Roman sculpture in France. After a period of decline, the Château de Richelieu was dismantled in the 19th century — not for any great political reasons, but by an estate agent. It was sold, stone for stone, as building material. Elements of the fabric appear to have been reused on farms in the area. Description=The châteauThe grounds The château was approached by a long double avenue of trees forming one of three avenues that met at a patte d'oie before the outer gates, which curved inwards to form half of a circle on the ground that was completed by the pattern formed by the three approaching approaches through the town; this nodal feature, with its flanking pavilions, survives, in the town's Place du Cardinal. In the two spandrel shapes enclosed behind the outer walling were matching enclosed outer service courts. Through the arched central gateway the visitor entered the vast basse cour, with common stabling for a hundred horses in a flanking courtyard to the left, with barns and lodgings for gardeners and estate workers, and to the right, an identical courtyard with elite stabling, bakehouse and other offices. Continuing along the axis one passed through a smaller cour d'honneur enclosed by matching ranges each with a central dome and end pavilions. There was a central fountain. Beyond was the rectangular moat that surrounded the château itself, with its inner court, reached across a central draw-bridge leading to the grand domed gatehouse, a handsome structure with Hercules and Mars in niches on either side and a statue of Louis XIII above, with a statue of Fame crowning the dome. The inner court was about two-thirds the width of the avant-cour. The main corps de logis was domed; its left-hand range enclosed the modest house of Richelieu's youth. Wings enclosed the court on either side; once again they had end pavilions with squared domes. On the façades of the piano nobile there were niches in the piers between windows, containing statues, and niches in the ground floor containing busts. The garden front looked onto a square parterre that was itself surrounded by moats and reached by a central bridge. Like the two outer courts, it was divided in four plats with a central feature. To either side a major cross-axis extended the patterned gardens. Ahead, at the terminus of the main axis, the woods drew back in an exedra. The site today The walled gardens of the château remain and are open as a public park. A few fragments of the palace buildings remain, such as the bridges over the moats, the \\"Honour Gateway\\", and some buildings from the service ranges; one of the latter is in use as a kind of museum or information centre and includes pictures and models of the palace as it once was. This building is covered in carved graffiti from visitors to the site, dating back at least as far as 1905, and including dated initials from the periods of both World War I and World War II, plus some graffiti from bearers of the Richelieu name. There is a small shop and management office at the entrance, and a car park between that and the town.

Formed in 1994, they released five albums, headlined the major SA festivals, spawned a crop of radio hits, toured Australia on the Big Day Out tour and picked up a couple of SAMA awards. The band’s eclectic brand of soulful rock/electronica avoided easy comparisons and elevated them to the status of media darlings. They received five South African Music Awards (SAMA) nominations of which they won three. Composed of Paul Flynn (vocals and guitar), Michael Westwood (guitar), Gavin Wienand (bass) and Garth McLeod (drums), Sugardrive began their existence playing riff-heavy alternative rock, but later their sound shifted more towards pop, incorporating elements of electronica, dance music and jazz. Their debut album, Belly Full Under was released on cassette in 1993, and saw the band gain some attention in South Africa. The release in 1995 of the follow-up, Hey God, It's Me helped to build on their reputation. In 1996, the Snapshots EP was released, heralding a change in direction for the band. The EP saw Sugardrive move more into the trance-pop territory pioneered by Portishead, and the album following this, Sand.Man.Sky - expanded on this new direction. In 1999, Sugardrive returned with When I Died I Was Elvis, their most popular album to date. In April 2001 the band decided to split up, with the band members each deciding to work on their own solo projects. In 2008 lead singer Paul E.

The third generation of Ford Taurus was the first to be completely redesigned from the ground up, and used a rounded, oval-derived design that was very controversial at the time, considered to be the main reason for this model's downfall in the market. It was designed to appeal to buyers of the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord — both of which were similarly styled — as well as to make Ford a design leader in the North American market, a title that was attributed to the Chrysler Corporation. Among the most controversial features of the design were both the front fascia that was composed of separate circular headlights, circular turn signals and the oval shaped rear window (the Sable, unlike the Taurus, had a more conventional window). This generation of Taurus was released for sale in late 1995 to mixed reactions from consumers. It managed to retain its status as the best selling car in America through the 1996 model year; however, this was achieved through heavy sales to car rental companies: only 49% of Taurus sales in 1996 were to private customers. Because of this, the Taurus lost its bestseller status in 1997 to the Toyota Camry. It was replaced by the more conservatively styled fourth-generation Ford Taurus in 1999. Third generation development Development for the third-generation Taurus began in 1991, and its designers and engineers believed that they were faced with a daunting task; they compared completely redesigning the Taurus to repainting the Mona Lisa. Like the first-generation Taurus, the new Taurus was developed by a team effort, in which the exterior and interior designers, engineers, and marketing staff had input on the new car. Many designs were considered during the development process, from designs that resembled the second generation cars, to more radically styled cars. They eventually decided on a radical new styling scheme based upon oval derived design elements in April 1992 (final approval), which would prove to be the car's Achilles heel in the marketplace. Chief designer Jack Telnack, who oversaw the development of the first and second generation Taurus, said that his Taurus was designed the way it was to stand out in the marketplace, and that the use of the oval was becoming the new global design theme for Ford. Breaking down and testing competing cars, as well as listening to customer input played a large part in the development of the third- generation Taurus, just like it did during the development of the first generation. Many competing cars were broken down and extensively tested in order for the Taurus to be designed to be superior to them in terms of comfort, performance, and refinement. Most notably, the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord were extensively tested, and the Taurus' suspension was designed to emulate these cars' ride and handling techniques. Customer input played a large part into the design of the third generation Taurus' interior. The dashboard's design originated from a large number of complaints from customers that the previous Taurus' radio and climate control modules were cluttered with many small and similar feeling buttons, as well as small graphics, which caused the driver to have to look away from the road to be able to operate them properly. As a result, a large portion of the third generation's dash was devoted to the radio and climate control, with each button on these modules containing a unique design, making it easier for the driver to operate the radio and climate control without taking their eyes off the road. This would eventually lead to the creation of the Integrated Control Panel. Making the new Taurus pleasing to the senses was a recurring theme throughout the third- generation Taurus' development. Ford's engineers specially tuned every panel and component, so that every sound that the Taurus made, from the doors closing to the engine running, was acoustically pleasing. Ford's trim designers specially selected every one of the Taurus' interior materials, so that every surface, as well as every button and control, was pleasing to the touch. Reception Controversial oval rear window The third-generation Taurus and Sable sedans were unveiled at the Cobo Center during the 1995 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, and garnered more attention from journalists and publications than any other car at the show. The wagon was unveiled on February 9, 1995 at the Chicago Auto Show, and garnered similar amounts of attention. After their respective unveilings, both vehicles became among the most anticipated new cars of the 1996 model year, similar to the first generation Taurus. The first third-generation Taurus rolled off the assembly line on July 12, 1995 at the Chicago Assembly Plant. Ford Chairman Alexander Trotman, who took part in the ceremonies, was joined by state and local politicians and union and plant officials in dipping their hands in yellow paint to \\"autograph\\" the hood of the first Taurus off the line. The hood is earmarked for permanent display at the plant. The Taurus was released to showrooms on September 24 of that year, and sales began a week later on October 1. The Taurus was released almost a week later than the Sable, as Ford designers consulted a $500 Sherman Oaks, California astrologer to figure out the best solstice date to release the car. Reception to the new Taurus by automotive publications was generally positive. Road & Track gave the Taurus a good review upon its release, and found its handling and refinement impressive. Motor Trend also gave the Taurus a positive review, although they found the oval styling awkward at first glance. Despite this, they found it to have many redeeming qualities. However, unlike the first-generation Taurus, it fell short of their Car of the Year award, which was instead awarded to the redesigned 1996 Dodge Caravan. Consumer reaction was mixed, however. Detractors of the new design pejoratively refer to this generation as the \\"Bubble\\" Taurus or \\"Submarine\\" Taurus based on the window shaping and broad curves used in the front end being seen as a negative. Ford had hoped the radical redesign would lead to the same success it had with the 1986 Taurus, and went as far as predicting that the new Taurus would continue the outgoing model's record of selling over 400,000 units a year. Sales were somewhat slow at first, prompting Ford to add a low priced \\"G\\" model mid-year 1996. Ford also offered incentives such as a six-month lease for Toyota Camry and Honda Accord owners, a $250 Cash Allowance on lease renewals, and a $50 dinner certificate for test driving the vehicle. It managed to keep its position as the best selling car in the United States in 1996, although this was because of heavy sales to rental fleets, which comprised 51% of all Taurus sales for that year. This is opposed to the Toyota Camry, of which the bulk of its sales were through retail outlets to individual customers. In 1997, the Taurus lost its bestselling title, as it slipped to #3 behind a redesigned Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord. Overview=Exterior The exterior of the third- generation Taurus was completely redesigned for 1996. It used a controversial new shape that chief designer Jack Telnack claimed was penned to make the Taurus stand out to sedan buyers, and compared the current Taurus to the likeness of a pair of slippers. This shape was based upon that of an oval, which was perhaps inspired by that of Ford's own logo, and while the previous Taurus used a flat, streamlined shape, this Taurus used a rounded shape similar to that of the Chrysler Concorde. The heavily-contoured sides took their cue from the Lincoln Mark VIII. Station wagons also got new sheet metal, although from the firewall back, the Taurus and Mercury Sable wagons again shared the same panels, with all station wagon doors being the same as those used on the Sable sedans. As the new-generation Taurus was aimed at a more mature, affluent customer base, its exterior contained many upscale styling touches. For example, the LX came with chrome alloy wheels, chrome dual exhaust tips, and the \\"Taurus\\" badge on the back was written in script, as opposed to the block letters used in previous generations. 1998–1999 Taurus sedan In 1998, the exterior of the Taurus received a slight redesign to make the shape more mainstream, in order to appeal to a wider customer base. The front bumper was redesigned to have a full-length opening, as well as moving the Ford logo down onto a chrome bar mounted in the grille, similar to that of the third-generation Taurus SHO. These years were also fitted with different front turn signal lenses, featuring completely clear lenses and a multi- reflector surface in the rear of the housing, around the bulb. The rear turn signal lenses were also changed from amber to red, to match the rest of the lightbar assembly. Interior The interior was also completely redesigned for the 1996 model year. Like that of the previous two generations, the interior was designed to be user-friendly. The gauges were placed in an oval podhttp://www.curbsideclassic.com/blog/curbside-analysis-1996-ford-taurus- misguided-styling-creates-the-biggest-automotive-fumble-of-the-modern-era/ while the dashboard wrapped slightly around the driver; all of the main controls were placed within easy reach, and were designed to be recognizable by touch and to be operated by drivers without taking their eyes off the road. The controls for the radio and climate control (some of which, like the preset buttons, were oval shapedhttps://www.drivechicago.com/reviews/1996-ford- taurus-dold-new-direction_43) were combined into an oval-shaped \\"Integrated Control Panel\\" mounted in the center of the dash, which was created in response to many complaints from Taurus owners that they couldn't easily operate the main controls of the radios and climate control systems without taking their eyes off the road. The \\"Integrated Control Panel\\" either came with a manual climate controls, or automatic climate controls.http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Ford/1996%20Ford/1996%20Ford%20Taurus%20Pocket%20Guide/image6.html Gone was wide and couch-like front row bench seating of previous generations. Another innovation was the \\"Flip-Fold\\" center console on cars not equipped with a standard floor console. It was a seat in between the bucket seats that could be transformed into a console, reducing the seating count by one. The seat cushion folded out into a console with a lockable storage bin and cupholders, resting against the dashboard. The seatback also folded down to become an armrest. A traditional center console with a floor-mounted shifter was installed on cars equipped without the flip fold console. This generation's interior wasn't as configurable as that of the first two generations. The G and GL models (see below) were only available with steering column-mounted shifter, along with a cloth front bench seat and the \\"Flip- Fold\\" center console. The LX, on the other hand, came standard with bucket seats that could be ordered with either cloth or leather upholstery, along with a center console and floor-mounted shifter. However, a column-mounted shifter and a cloth front bench was available as a no-cost option. In 1999, the interior was again available in three configurations, like that of the first-generation Taurus; a front bench seat with a column-mounted shifter, front bucket seats with a center console and floor-mounted shifter, or front bucket seats with a center console and a column-mounted shifter. Each configuration was offered in both Taurus models (see below). The Ford Taurus has many seating options, ranging from 5 people to 8 people. On wagons and sedans equipped with the floor mounted shifter, it seated 5 people standard, and wagons could seat up to 7 people, with a bench in the third row. Also, models equipped with the flip fold console could seat either 6 or 8 people, depending on whether the wagons had a third row bench or not. The sedans could seat a maximum of 6 people with the flip fold console, and 5 people with a regular console. Models and engines Taurus wagon At its launch, the Taurus was available in two models, the GL, which was the entry level/value model, and the LX, which was the top of the line model. The GL was basic, and didn't have many optional features, while the LX came with many standard features and was highly configurable. To close the price gap between the Taurus and the Ford Contour, as well as to increase sales, an entry-level G model was added midway into the 1996 model year, as essentially a slightly de- contented GL. For the 1998 model year, the models of Taurus were completely changed. The G and GL were dropped, and the LX became the entry-level/value model. The SE model from 1995 was revived, and it became the top-tier model. The SE was offered with two special packages; the Comfort package which added chrome wheels carried over from the LX, automatic climate control, the Duratec engine V6 (see below), and bucket seats with a center console and a floor- mounted shifter, or the Sport package, which contained all of the features in the comfort package, but substituted the chrome wheels for 5-spoke alloy wheels. The 1996 model year was the first time that the Taurus did not have an optional engine. The base G and GL had the 3.0 L Vulcan V6, which was a carryover from the previous model. The top of the line LX, however, got the new 3.0 L DOHC Duratec 30 V6, which produced and was developed specifically for this model. When Ford rearranged the Taurus models for 1998, the Vulcan became the standard engine, and the Duratec became optional on all models. However, it was only available on the SE for 1999. Vulcan-equipped models came with the 4-speed AX4S automatic transmission, while Duratec equipped models got the 4-speed AX4N transmission. However, some Vulcan-equipped models randomly received the AX4N transmission for no apparent reason. Ford also deleted some features for the 1999 model year, in order to lower the price about one thousand dollars, and possibly boost sales. Some deleted features included the floor courtesy lamps and glove compartment lamp. Variants=Mercury Sable Third-generation Mercury Sable GS Third-generation Mercury Sable The Mercury Sable, a sister model of the Taurus aimed at a more upscale audience, was also redesigned for the 1996 model year. As with previous generations, the Sable used the same mechanical parts as the Taurus with a unique body. However, the 1996 Sable ditched the unique styling cues of the previous generations, specifically the front light bar, wrap-around rear glass and skirted rear fender, in favor of a design theme that more closely resembled that of the Taurus. For the first time, the Sable didn't get a unique interior design, instead sharing all of its interior components with the Taurus with the exception of branded parts and unique woodgrain trim. Trim levels were carried over from the previous generation: A base model GS and high-end LS, with a base G model briefly offered during the second half of the 1996 model year. The Sable had the same powertrains and most features as the Taurus, though no counterpart to the high performance SHO was offered. Prices increased, corresponding with the increase in price of the Taurus. While the design of the Taurus was polarizing, the more conservative design of the Sable was praised; Automobile Magazine selected the Sable as its 1996 design of the year.1996 Sable advertisement Unlike the Taurus, sales of the Sable stayed steady with the previous model, and styling revisions for 1998 were limited to a new grille and headlamps. The Taurus and Sable were produced concurrently through the 1999 model year. Ford Taurus SHO Third-generation Ford Taurus SHO As with the Taurus, a new model of Taurus SHO was launched for 1996. Although it contained less aggressive styling than its predecessors, it still differed from the normal Taurus with different seats, wheels, bumpers, drivetrain, as well as a fin being put on the driver's side windshield wiper, to keep it on the windshield at high speeds. A aluminum 3.4 L V8 engine with heads from Yamaha and block from Cosworth was specified for the SHO model, but it was given the same 4-speed transmission as the LX: the manual gearbox option was no longer offered on the SHO. This was partly because this model of SHO was designed for comfort instead of performance. This model of SHO gained a reputation of being trouble-prone due to a large number of engine failures at around the 50,000-mile mark due to separation of the camshaft from its sprocket. However, this problem can be rectified by having the camshafts welded. Possibly because of this, this generation of SHO sold substantially worse than its predecessor, with sales peaking at 9,000 in 1997. As a result, the SHO was discontinued outright after the 1999 model year. Export Models 1996–1998 Ford Taurus Ghia sedan (Australia) In addition to being sold in the North American market, third-generation models were exported to many other countries, in left and right-hand drive configurations. However, this action proved unsuccessful. Export models wore Mercury Sable headlamps and a unique front bumper cover to conform to these countries' regulations regarding automotive lighting. Right-hand-drive versions used a hand-operated parking brake in the center console instead of a foot-operated parking brake as in North America. Australians tended to stay away from the Taurus, due to their high price; a well-equipped, larger-engined rear-wheel drive Ford Fairmont cost around the same amount. Australian buyers could only opt for a single-spec sedan, known as the Taurus Ghia. However, in New Zealand the Taurus was quite popular. While Australia only saw the sedan model and was sold in 1998, both the sedan and station wagon models were available in New Zealand. Launched while Japan was in a recession following the 1991 collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble, this generation Taurus was exported to Japan in limited numbers, and sold at Japanese auto dealerships called Autorama (a joint venture with Mazda), where the sedan and wagon versions with right-hand driving positions until 1997. To Japanese buyers, it was regarded as a luxury vehicle as the exterior dimensions and engine displacement exceeded Japanese Government regulations, and buyers in Japan were liable for additional taxes. The engine displacement also put operating costs for Japanese owners in a higher annual road tax obligation. Replacement Fourth-generation Ford Taurus Fourth-generation Ford Taurus In 1999, Ford launched the fourth-generation Ford Taurus to replace the third generation. Although the doors and mechanical parts were carried over, this generation was designed with a more conservative design in hopes of increasing its appeal to customers. This new shape contained a more upright trunk and rear roof panel, of which increased headroom and trunk space substantially. This generation also contained a redesigned interior that sported a more conservative look, while retaining many features offered in the third generation. However, this model of Taurus is most notable for offering a special system that Ford called the \\"Personal Safety System\\". This system had sensors in the seat that detected a passenger's weight and position, and inflated the airbags to match. This generation of Taurus was sold from 1999 through the beginning of the 2007 model year, in which it was discontinued with the entire Taurus nameplate. However, the Taurus nameplate would later be revived in a matter of months due to the insistence of then-new Ford CEO Alan Mulally.

'𓊖' (the determinative O49) is used to designate the term for 'country, inhabited/cultivated land', called the niw.t (a political designate). It is a circle with a cross which represents a street, 'town intersection'.Gardiner 2005 (1957): 498. 𓆎), the symbol to the right of the bottom-most cow, identifies it as \\"Black\\".

A small summary of the entries, and their referenced works follow: The last three of four entries ending the 27 entries deal with black stones, or powders and black plants, or seeds; (all small multiple, plural, grains-of, items). They are preceded by entries 21 and 22, a \\"buckler\\", or \\"shield\\", and \\"black wood\\". Entry 26 is an image, or statue, using the vertical mummy hieroglyph gardiner A53, (\\"in the form of\\", \\"the custom of\\"). These last six entries are unreferenced. The first 4 of 5 entries, kam, kam-t, or kamkam all deal with items coming to an end. (Entry four is untranslated and is from Pap. 3024, Lepsius, Denkmaler-(papyrus).)

The other hieroglyph word entries of entry 9 to 20, have about fifteen further references, all starting with the km hieroglyph. On the other hand, the works of Budge have not held up well in terms of recent hieroglyph scholarship since the 1930s. Even during Budge's own lifetime, many Egyptological scholars disputed Budge's interpretation of glyphs and texts.D. Forbes 1997: 79 Today, no modern Egyptological scholar relies upon the works of E. A. W. Budge as evidence of proper glyph rendering, by either his translation or transliteration (his transliteration system was unique to Budge alone as most Egyptologists then (and today) relied upon the transcription and transliteration system developed by the Berlin School which issued the master compendium of Egyptian hieroglyphic language in 1926, Wörterbuch der Aegyptischen Sprache (7 Vols.),Bierbrier 1995: 72 and which is detailed in the publication by A. H. Gardiner, Egyptian Grammar: Being an Introduction to the Study of Hieroglyphs (1957)). As such, references to Budge's dictionary and within Budge's dictionary are considered highly suspect by most Egyptologists today, as they do not actually relate back to the terms as he defined them. Shield \\"Shield\\", ikm and another word with an approximate km cognate, 'khm starting with the vowel ( ' ), 'khm, meaning to put to an end are the possible words related to the origins of the crocodile skin, and the 'verb of action', of items coming to an end. The second word 'khm has nine entries in the Budge dictionary,Budge, An Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary, p. 135B, p. 136A. shield, ikam, has two entries.Budge, Ibid., p. 94A.

Other animals, such as cats and dogs, do not play a role in transmission. Head lice feed only on human blood and are only able to survive on human head hair. When adults, they are about 2 to 3 mm long. When not attached to a human, they are unable to live beyond three days. Humans can also become infected with two other lice – the body louse and the crab louse. To make the diagnosis, live lice must be found. Using a comb can help with detection. Empty eggshells (known as nits) are not sufficient for the diagnosis. Possible treatments include: combing the hair frequently with a fine tooth comb or shaving the head completely. A number of topical medications are also effective, including malathion, ivermectin, and dimethicone. Dimethicone, which is a silicone oil, is often preferred due to the low risk of side effects. Pyrethroids such as permethrin have been commonly used; however, they have become less effective due to increasing pesticide resistance. There is little evidence for alternative medicines. Head-lice infestations are common, especially in children. In Europe, they infect between 1 and 20% of different groups of people. In the United States, between 6 and 12 million children are infected a year. They occur more often in girls than boys. It has been suggested that historically, head lice infection were beneficial, as they protected against the more dangerous body louse. Infestations may cause stigmatization of the infected individual. Signs and symptoms Adult male (left) and female (right) head lice Head lice are generally uncomfortable, but typically do not constitute a serious condition. The most common symptom is itching of the head, which normally worsens 3 to 4 weeks after the initial infestation. The bite reaction is very mild, and it can be rarely seen between the hairs. Bites can be seen, especially in the neck of long-haired individuals when the hair is pushed aside. Swelling of the local lymph nodes and fever are rare. Itching may cause skin breakdown and uncommonly result in a bacterial infection. In Ethiopia, head lice appear to be able to spread louse-born epidemic typhus and Bartonella quintana. In Europe, the head lice do not appear to carry these infections. Cause Head lice are generally spread through direct head-to- head contact with an infested person. Transmission by sharing bedding or clothing such as headwear is much less common. The cause of head lice infestations is not related to cleanliness. Neither hair length nor how often the hair is brushed affect the risk of infection. Body lice are spread through direct contact with the body, clothing, or other personal items of a person already carrying lice. Pubic lice are most often spread by intimate contact with an infested person. Head lice occur on the head hair, body lice on the clothing, and pubic lice mainly on the hair near the groin. Lice cannot burrow into the skin. Other lice that infest humans are the body louse and the crab louse. The claws of these three species are adapted to attachment to specific hair diameters. Diagnosis Head louse crawling on a hairbrush Lice comb (Bug Buster) wet combing with conditioner for diagnosis and treatment. Head lice can be seen in foam. The condition is diagnosed by finding live lice in the hair. Finding empty eggs is not enough. This is made easier by using a magnifying glass or running a comb through the child's hair. In questionable cases, a child can be referred to a health professional. However, the condition is overdiagnosed, with extinct infestations being mistaken for active ones. As a result, lice-killing treatments are more often used on noninfested than infested children. The use of a louse comb is the most effective way to detect living lice. With both methods, special attention should be paid to the area near the ears and the nape of the neck. The use of a magnifying glass to examine the material collected between the teeth of the comb could prevent misdiagnosis. The presence of nits alone, however, is not an accurate indicator of an active head louse infestation. Generally, white nits are empty egg casings, while brown nits may still contain viable louse larva. One way of determining the nit is to squeeze it between two fingernails; it gives a characteristic snapping pop sound as the egg bursts. Children with nits on their hair have a 35–40% chance of also being infested with living lice and eggs. If lice are detected, the entire family needs to be checked (especially children up to the age of 13 years) with a louse comb, and only those who are infested with living lice should be treated. As long as no living lice are detected, the child should be considered negative for head louse infestation. Accordingly, a child should be treated with a pediculicide only when living lice are detected on their hair (not because he/she has louse eggs/nits on the hair and not because the scalp is itchy). Prevention World War II-era American poster, created to prevent outbreaks of pediculosis among servicemen Examination of the child's head at regular intervals using a louse comb allows the diagnosis of louse infestation at an early stage. Early diagnosis makes treatment easier and reduces the possibility of infesting others. In times and areas when louse infestations are common, weekly examinations of children, especially those 4–15 years old, carried out by their parents, will aid control. Additional examinations are necessary if the child came in contact with infested individuals, if the child frequently scratches his/her head, or if nits suddenly appear on the child's hair. Keeping long hair tidy could be helpful in the prevention of infestations with head lice. Clothes, towels, bedding, combs, and brushes, which came in contact with the infested individual, can be disinfected either by leaving them outside for at least two days or by washing them at 60 °C (140 °F) for 30 minutes.Kidshealth.org – Head lice, page-3 This is because adult lice can survive only one to two days without a blood meal and are highly dependent on human body warmth. An insecticidal treatment of the house and furniture is not necessary. Treatment There are a number of treatments effective for head lice. These methods include combs, shaving, medical creams, and hot air. Medical creams usually require two treatments a week apart. Head lice are not justification to keep children home from school as the risk of spread is low. Mechanical measures Shaving the head can effectively treat lice. Wet combing a few times a day for a few weeks may also get rid of the infestation in half of people. This requires the use of a special lice comb with extra fine teeth. This is the recommended method for infants and women who are pregnant. Another treatment is the use of heated air applied by a hair dryer. This can be of special use in early stages of an infestation, since it has very high mortality for eggs. Medications There are many medications which can kill lice. Dimethicone is between 70 and 97% effective with a low rate of side effects, and thus is seen as the preferred treatment. It works by physical means and there is no evidence of pesticide resistance. Ivermectin is around 80% effective, but can cause local skin irritation. Malathion has an effectiveness around 90%, but there's the possibility of toxicity. Pyrethroids such as permethrin, while commonly used, have lower rates of effectiveness due to the resistance among lice. Effectiveness varies from 10 to 80%, depending on the population studied. Medications within a lotion appear to work better than those within a shampoo. Benzyl alcohol appears effective but it is unclear if it is better than standard treatments. Abametapir was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2020. Alternative medicine Tea tree oil has been promoted as a treatment for head lice; however, there is no clear evidence of its effectiveness. A 2012 review of head lice treatment recommended against the use of tea tree oil for children because it could cause skin irritation or allergic reactions, because of contraindications, and because of a lack of knowledge about the oil's safety and effectiveness. Other home remedies, such as putting vinegar, isopropyl alcohol, olive oil, mayonnaise, or melted butter under a shower cap, have been disproven. The CDC states that swimming has no effect on lice, and can decrease the effectiveness of some treatments. Environment After treatment, people are often instructed to wash all bedding and vacuum all areas the head may have been, such as car seats, coat hoods, and sofas, but this is not always necessary, since adult lice will die within 2 days without a blood meal, and newly hatched lice die within minutes of hatching. Combs and brushes may be deloused in boiling water for 5–10 minutes. Items may also be frozen for 24 hours well below the freezing point of water to ensure that ice crystals form within the cells of the lice. Epidemiology The number of cases of human louse infestations (or pediculosis) has increased worldwide since the mid-1960s, reaching hundreds of millions annually. It is estimated between 1 and 20% of specific groups in Europe are infected. Despite improvements in medical treatment and prevention of human diseases during the 20th century, head louse infestation remains stubbornly prevalent. In 1997, 80% of American elementary schools reported at least one outbreak of lice. Lice infestation during that same period was more prevalent than chickenpox. About 6–12 million children between the ages of 3 and 11 are treated annually for head lice in the United States alone. High levels of louse infestations have also been reported from all over the world, including Israel, Denmark, Sweden, U.K., France, and Australia. The United Kingdom's National Health Service report that lice have no preference for any type of hair be it clean, dirty, or short. The number of children per family, the sharing of beds and closets, hair washing habits, local customs and social contacts, healthcare in a particular area (e.g. school), and socioeconomic status were found to be factors in head louse infestation in Iran. Other studies found no relationship between frequency of brushing or shampooing. The California Department of Public Health indicates that chronic head lice infestation may be a sign of socioeconomic or family problems. Children between 4 and 13 years of age are the most frequently infested group. In the U.S., African-American children have lower rates of infestation. Head lice (Pediculus humanus capitis) infestation is most frequent on children aged 3–10 and their families. Females get head lice twice as often as males, and infestation in persons of Afro-Caribbean or other black descent is rare because of hair consistency. But these children may have nits that hatch and the live lice could be transferred by head contact to other children. Society and culture *To a Louse (on a lady's bonnet). Perhaps the most widely known cultural reference to pediculosis capitis, occurring in a noted poem by Robert Burns. Other animals Lice infestation in general is known as pediculosis, and occurs in many mammalian and bird species. Lice infesting other host species are not the same organism as that which causes head lice infestations in humans, nor do the three louse species which infest humans infest any other host species.

The range of the Southwestern dialects on the territory of Bulgaria includes most of west central and southwestern Bulgaria. The Southwestern dialects border on the Northwestern dialects to the north, the Transitional dialects to the northwest and the Balkan dialects and the Rup dialects to the northeast and southeast, respectively. If the Macedonian language is regarded as a third literary form of Modern Bulgarian, then the Southwestern dialects extend west and southwest to include the Slavic dialects in Vardar Macedonia and the western half of Greek Macedonia. Should the Macedonian language be counted as a separate language, then the southernmost dialect of the group, the Blagoevgrad-Petrich or Pirin dialect, along with the corresponding variety on the Macedonian side of the border, the Maleshevo dialect, constitute a transitional dialect between Bulgarian and Macedonian. A defining characteristic of the Southwestern dialects is the gradual transition from one dialect to another, as well as to dialects which belong to other dialectal groups. For example, the Dupnitsa dialect is transitional to both the Samokov dialect and the Blagoevgrad-Petrich dialect, the Botevgrad dialect is transitional to the Eastern Bulgarian Balkan dialects, and especially to the Pirdop dialect, etc. etc. Phonological and morphological characteristics * Old Church Slavonic ѣ' (yat) is always pronounced as ' vs. formal Bulgarian я/е (~) – бел/бели (white, white pl.) * щ~жд (~) for Proto-Slavic ~ (as in Standard Bulgarian) - леща, между (lentils, between). The future tense particle is, however, different in the different dialects: ще, ше, че, к҄е, к҄у The diacritic ◌҄ indicates palatalization. Map of the Bulgarian dialects within Bulgaria * The reflex of Old Church Slavonic ѫ (yus) is generally a, with the exception of the Sofia dialect where it is ъ ('): каща vs. formal Bulgarian къща (house) * The reflex of Old Church Slavonic ъ gradually shifts from north to south from only a to both a and o. The northern dialects (e.g. the Vratsa dialect) have only a, the central ones (e.g. the Ihtiman dialect) have mostly a with occurrences of o only in certain suffixes and prefixes, the southern ones (e.g. the Maleševo-Pirin dialect) have only o in suffixes and prefixes and some roots and a in other roots * Preserved transition of o into e after ж , ш , ч : ножеве vs. formal Bulgarian ножове (knives) * Single masculine definite article -o (as in the Moesian dialects) or a (as in the Balkan Pirdop dialect), depending on the dialect: гар'бо/гар'бa vs. Standard Bulgarian гър'бът (the back). * Widespread formation of past passive participles with -н: чуен vs. formal Bulgarian чут (heard) * Suffix -чки instead of -шки for formation of certain adjectives: човечки vs. човешки For the phonological and morphological characteristics of the individual dialects included in the dialectal group, cf. individual articles.

As an activist, he is a founding member of the New Afrikan People's Organization and the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement.Professor Akinyele K. Umoja gsu.edu In April 2013, New York University Press published Umoja's book We Will Shoot Back: Armed Resistance in the Mississippi Freedom Movement. Currently, he is a Professor and Department Chair of the Department of African-American Studies at Georgia State University (GSU). Early life and education Akinyele Omowale Umoja was born in Los Angeles, California, in 1954, and spent much of his childhood in Compton, California. He graduated from high school in 1972. Umoja received his BA in Afro-American studies from California State University, Los Angeles, in June 1986. He earned his M.A. in August 1990 at the Institute of Liberal Arts at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. While a Ph.D. candidate at Emory under Robin Kelley, his dissertation topic was “Eye for an Eye: Armed Resistance in the Mississippi Freedom Movement.” Career=Early activism in California Umoja has been active in the liberation struggle of Afrikan people, particularly working with the New Afrikan Independence Movement. After beginning to attend UCLA in 1972, as a freshman, he began to write for the student newspaper NOMMO and also joined the Muhammad Ahmad (Max Stanford) Defense Committee (MADC). When activist Ahmad was held on conspiracy charges, Umoja organized petitions and fundraisers to secure Ahmad's release. He dropped out of UCLA, also joining the African People's Party and the House of Umoja. Two years later, he was a founding member of the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement and the New Afrikan People's Organization. Umoja has since represented both organizations nationally and in international forums in the Caribbean, Africa, and Europe. From 1972 until 1982, Umoja was on the staff of Soulbook: The Revolutionary Journal of the Black World, founded by Mamadou Lumumba. He was also very active in activism in Los Angeles during this time, where he organized security and assistance for several of Malcolm X’s associates. He was also active with the Coalition Against Police Abuse (CAPA) in Los Angeles. In 1979, Umoja was in a committee of the National Black Human Rights Coalition, which produced a document “detailing the Black liberation movement’s demand for self-determination, reparations and a call to release political prisoners.” It was presented to the Secretary General of the United Nations at that time, who was Salim Salim of Tanzania. Career in education Umoja has varied experiences as an educator. He has taught in secondary schools, alternative schools, and colleges and universities, as well as developed Afrikan-centered curriculum for public schools and community- education programs. In the late 1980s, he taught social studies in Atlanta's public schools, where he also taught African-American history from 1986 until 1991 at the Atlanta Metropolitan College. In the early 1990s, he began teaching in the history department of Clark Atlanta University, where he lectured until 1996. He then became a professor at the Department of African American Studies at Georgia State University (GSU), and is also department chair. Writing and recent appearances Umoja's writing has been featured in scholarly publications as The Journal of Black Studies, New Political Science, The International Journal of Africana Studies, Black Scholar, Radical History Review and Socialism and Democracy. Umoja was one of the contributors to Blackwell Companion on African American History, The Black Panther Party Reconsidered, Liberation, Imagination, and the Black Panther Party, and Malcolm X: A Historical Reader. In April 2013, New York University Press published Umoja's first single-authored book, which was titled We Will Shoot Back: Armed Resistance in the Mississippi Freedom Movement. A review in The Clarion-Ledger in 2015 described the book as following “confrontations in communities across the state through the end of the 1970s, demonstrating how black Mississippians were ultimately able to overcome intimidation by mainstream society, defeat legal segregation, and claim a measure of political control of their state.” He was honored for the book in 2014 in Oakland. Umoja has been a contributor to commercial and popular documentaries on black history. Umoja was a featured commentator on the American Gangster episode “Dr. Mutulu Shakur,” which aired on November 8, 2008. He also appears in Bastards of the Party (2006) and Freedom Archives’ Cointelpro 101 (2010). In recent years, he supported movements in Guyana and Haiti, and, in August 2010, he led a Black August delegation of the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement to Haiti to investigate conditions after a recent earthquake. In 2013, he lectured in Mississippi on the 1965 boycott by black citizens. In 2014, he offered the solemn libations in honor of his late friend Chokwe Lumumba at the mayor's funeral in Jackson, Mississippi. Awards and recognition He earned the Patricia Harris Fellowship from 1990 until 1993, and, in 1994, he was named in Who’s Who in America’s Teachers. In 1995, he was an honorary member of the National Golden Key Honor Society.

It has smooth bark, lance-shaped or curved adult leaves, flower buds usually in groups of three, white flowers and cup-shaped, cylindrical or barrel-shaped fruit. Description Corymbia dallachiana is a tree that typically grows to a height of , sometimes more, and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth white to cream-coloured and pinkish bark that is shed in thin patches. Sometimes there is a short stocking of rough grey bark at the base of the trunk. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leathery elliptical, later egg-shaped to lance-shaped leaves that are long, wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are the same shade of green on both sides, lance-shaped or curved, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils on a branched peduncle up to long, each branch of the peduncle usually with three buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering has been observed in November and December and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped, cylindrical or barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with the valves enclosed in the fruit or at rim level. Taxonomy and naming Dallachy's ghost gum was first formally described in 1867 by George Bentham who gave it the name Eucalyptus tessellaris var. dallachiana and published the description in Flora Australiensis. In 1995 Kenneth Hill and Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson raised the variety to species status as Corymbia dallachiana in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (dallachiana) honours John Dallachy. Distribution and habitat Corymbia dallachiana grows in grassy woodland on plains and on creek levees east of a line from Coen to Jericho and south from Bathurst Bay to Rockhampton and Emerald.

He established an international reputation before the War, while he was professor at the University of Vienna. His work on race and culture was serviceable to the German nationalist movement of the 1930s. At the time of the Anschluss he served as Minister of Education in the cabinet formed by Arthur Seyß-Inquart. He avoided indictment as a war criminal and resumed his career in Argentina after the war.This article is based on a translation from the German Wikipedia, August 2008.  Life  Menghin was born in Meran, Tyrol. He qualified for inauguration as an academic lecturer in 1913, for his work Urgeschichte des Menschen (The Proto- History of Mankind). After the death of Moritz Hoernes he emerged as university professor of the Protohistorical Institute of the University of Vienna from 1917 until 1945, and furthermore he was from 1930 to 1933 professor at the University of Cairo. From 1919 to 1926 Menghin was a member of Secret Nazi Society Deutsche Gemeinschaft (the German Fellowship), in which he got to know Arthur Seyß-Inquart. In 1932 he participated in the First International Congress of Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences in London in 1932 with Hugo Obermaier and others. In 1934 he published Geist und Blut. For the academic year of 1935/36 he was appointed Rector of the University of Vienna. After numerous unsuccessful attempts there followed in 1936 his election as a regular Member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. From July 1936 to June 1937 he was a member of the governing council of the Viennese National (Vaterländische) Front. On 11 March 1938 he became Education Minister in the so-called Anschluss-Cabinet of Seyß-Inquart. During his term with the Party down to the end of May, there occurred not only the decree of the Anschluss itself, but also the so-called \\"Cleansing\\" of the University of Vienna. This meant that a fixed ratio of 2% was brought in for Jewish students, and about 40% of the teaching body were dismissed on account of \\"Jewish origins\\" proportionately on \\"political grounds\\". In August 1938 Menghin went back to the University of Vienna. He was friends with Adolf Mahr In Catholic circles he was considered a traitor from March 1938 onwards, and was discharged (excluded) from his Cartellverband (Catholic Union-group), the Rudolfina Wien (which like all Catholic unions had been banned), at a formal underground meeting held on 12 November 1938. After the War he was included, as a member of the Seyß-Inquart regime, on the primary list of war criminals. He was however not indicted, but came to an American internment camp, where he made statements. 1948 was the year in which he went over to Argentina, where he became University Professor in Buenos Aires, and from 1957 also at the University of La Plata. Proceedings against him were dropped in 1956. In 1959 he became a corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. He died, aged 85, on 29 November 1973 in Buenos Aires in Argentina.

Designed by noted American architect H. H. Richardson, it was one of the last of the railroad stations he designed in the northeastern United States to be built. The station, built in 1884–85, served as a major stop on the B&A; Main Line as well as a hub for branch lines to Milford, Mansfield, Fitchburg, and Lowell. After years of deterioration, the station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975 as the Framingham Railroad Station, and restored a decade later. In 2001, MBTA Framingham/Worcester Line and Amtrak operations were shifted to a new set of platforms nearby, which have high-level sections for handicapped-accessible boarding and a footbridge for crossing the tracks. This new station is among the busiest on the MBTA system, with 41 daily MBTA and 2 Amtrak trains on weekdays. The H. H. Richardson-designed station building remains largely intact and is currently used as a restaurant. History 1848-built station photographed in 1861 1848-built station, moved from its original location and converted to a freight house, in 1959 Boston and Worcester Railroad The Boston and Worcester Railroad, which had opened from Boston to Newton in April 1834, opened to South Framingham in August 1834. The village's first major station, a 2-story wooden Dutch Colonial structure, was constructed in 1848. After being replaced, it was moved slightly west and converted to a freight house – a function it served until it was demolished in the 1960s. Over the next several decades, South Framingham became an important regional rail hub. The Boston and Worcester built its 12-mile Milford Branch from South Framingham to Milford via Holliston in 1848. The next year, the B&W; built a short branch to Framingham Center, which the B&W; mainline had bypassed. This line, later called the Agricultural Branch Railroad, was realigned near Framingham Center and extended to Pratts Junction in Sterling in 1855. Franklin Street was built on the former branch right of way. The Agricultural Branch and the Framingham & Lowell (which branched off it at Framingham Center) were the northernmost section of the Old Colony Railroad, which took over the lines in 1879. The Old Colony's access to South Framingham was the Mansfield & Framingham, which opened in 1870 and was also acquired in 1879. By the time of the Old Colony takeover, South Framingham featured the 1848-built station, a freight house, a car house, and three separate engine houses serving the various branch lines. Through service on the mainline operated as far as Albany; the B&W; had joined with the Western Railroad in 1867 to become the Boston and Albany Railroad. Framingham began to be used occasionally as a short turn terminus for Boston-bound commuter trains in the early 1860s and continuously as such after 1864. , a small number of Framingham/Worcester Line trains are short-turned at Framingham. H. H. Richardson depot H. H. Richardson depot under construction in 1885 Interior of the station in 1959 Beginning in 1881, the Boston & Albany began a massive improvement program that included the building of over 30 new stations along its main line as well as the Highland Branch, which it bought in 1883. Famed architect H. H. Richardson was hired to design nine of these stations, including South Framingham which was commissioned in October 1883. The $62,718 station, built in 1884–85 by the Norcross Brothers company, was the largest and costliest of the nine. The station is a prime example of the Richardsonian Romanesque style, built of rough-hewn granite with contrasting details. The dominant roofline, dormers, arched bow window, and wooden interior are typical of the style. Like many of Richardson's designs, the station was well-praised; Henry- Russell Hitchcock called it a \\"better and somewhat more personal work\\" in The Architecture of H. H. Richardson and His Time. A small square baggage room was built in the same style just east of the station, near the Concord Street (Route 126) grade crossing. The station's importance remained through the first half of the 20th century. After the Boston & Albany was acquired by the New York Central Railroad in 1900, third and fourth tracks were extended in 1907 to South Framingham from Lake Crossing station in Wellesley. In 1911, the NYC considered laying third rail on the main line as far as South Framingham, as well as on the Highland Branch, to allow more frequent electric service on the lines. This would have been the only electrified commuter service directly into Boston, as neither the later-electrified Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad nor experimental electric service on the South Shore Railroad went directly to downtown. However, the plan was abandoned because the infrastructure cost would have exceeded the annual savings on fuel. (In 1959, the Highland Branch received catenary wire and was turned into the Green Line D branch). Due in no small part to the presence of the station, South Framingham eclipsed Framingham Center in size; on January 8, 1915, the station was renamed Framingham. Traffic on the B&A; and its various branch lines, though, decreased after World War I. In 1919, Agricultural Branch trains were cut to Framingham, requiring a transfer to continue Boston or Mansfield. The line was cut back to Marlborough in 1931, and passenger service ended in 1937. Passenger service on the Mansfield & Framingham ended in 1933. The Milford Branch lasted the longest of the Boston & Albany branch lines; it was cut to one daily trip in 1953 and terminated in April 1959. MBTA era An MBTA train at Framingham in 1977 The Lake Shore Limited at Framingham in 1977 In January 1960, the New York Central planned to end all service on the line, due to the opening of the Green Line D branch to Riverside in July 1959. However, that April, following public outcry over the planned discontinuation of service, the railroad was ordered to continue limited service, leaving Framingham with 8 daily round trips. When the extension of the Massachusetts Turnpike to downtown Boston began in 1961, the third and fourth tracks were removed. The NYC merged into Penn Central in 1968; by 1969, Framingham saw just 4 daily round trips. The MBTA began subsidizing service as far as Framingham in January 1973; the last Worcester round trip ended on October 27, 1975, leaving Framingham as the terminus of the line. The modern Amtrak Lake Shore Limited was established 4 days later, and has provided intercity service via Framingham ever since. From 1996 until their 2004 discontinuation, Amtrak Inland Route trains also stopped at Framingham. By the 1970s, the station had fallen into disrepair; part of the roof collapsed in 1978. On January 17, 1975, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places as Framingham Railroad Station. The building was restored in 1985, and has been occupied by various restaurants since. The original interior is no longer extant, but the exterior is mostly complete. The small baggage office east of the station building has been converted into a bank ATM. When the Needham Line was closed in October 1979 for Southwest Corridor construction, service on the Framingham line was increased considerably as partial compensation. By April 1984, the MBTA operated 12.5 daily round trips from Framingham. Service was restored to Worcester on September 26, 1994 as mitigation for delays in reopening the Old Colony Lines (the first two of which finally opened in September 1997) – the first time in 19 years that commuter rail service extended beyond Framingham. New station 2001-built accessible mini-high platforms and fence to prevent pedestrians from crossing the tracks The restored 1885 depot is now a local restaurant The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 mandated that all new construction on transit stations including making the stations handicapped accessible. Because the 1885 depot is very close to the tracks, such upgrades at the old station location would have been difficult. Construction of accessible platforms and expanded parking was originally approved by the MBTA Board in May 1992. New platforms, with mini- high platforms on their west ends for level boarding, were built just west of the former station. A footbridge with two elevators was built to allow passengers to reach the outbound platform without crossing the tracks, which carry slow-moving CSX freight service as well as MBTA and Amtrak trains. The new platforms opened in early 2001, but the elevators were not yet open by that July. Framingham currently sees 21 weekday MBTA round trips to Boston, with 8 to 9 round trips on weekends. On weekdays, Framingham is the only station west of Lansdowne station at which all trains stop. Most trains run to/from Worcester, but some terminate at Framingham instead. Average weekday ridership is 1,130 passengers, making Framingham the second-busiest station on the line outside Boston (after ). Framingham also has Amtrak intercity service via the daily Lake Shore Limited, which runs to Chicago's Union Station via Albany–Rensselaer. In October 2016, the MetroWest Regional Transit Authority (MWRTA) took over management of the station from the MBTA under a lease agreement. The agreement relieves the MBTA from the cost of maintaining the station, while allowing the MWRTA to use parking revenue to construct bus shelters and additional parking areas. An additional parking lot was opened inside the wye on the north side of the station in August 2017. Other Framingham stations Map of current and former railroad stations in and around Framingham Framingham Centre station around 1900 Nobscot station around 1910 Saxonville station with a train in 1880 Besides the main depot at the South Framingham junction, Framingham has been served by a number of stations inside or just outside its borders. The Agricultural Branch included three of these stations. One, variously known as Montwait, Mt. Wayte, and Lakeview, was located just north of Mt. Wayte Avenue at the north end of Farm Pond. The station served the Montwait neighborhood as well as the Montwait Camp Ground, a worship camp used by Methodist, Chautaqua, and later Pentecostal groups from the 1870s to the 1910s. The Framingham Centre station – at times known simply as Framingham – located at Maynard Street adjacent to Route 9. It was opened in 1849 when the branch to Framingham Center was completed. A new station was built in 1855 when the branch was realigned and extended. It also served the Framingham & Lowell after that line opened in 1871. A freight house and coal shed were located nearby to the north. Fayville station was located just over the Southborough border in the Fayville village and also served the western reaches of Framingham. The station was placed at Central Street between Route 9 and Route 30 at or after the 1855 opening of the line. The three stations closed with the end of passenger service on the branch in 1937; none of the buildings remain. The Framingham & Lowell shared the South Framingham and Framingham Centre stations after its 1871 opening. An additional station, variously known as North Framingham and Nobscot, was located between Water Street and Edgell road, near the modern Nobscot Shopping Center. The station closed with the end of passenger service in the 1930s and was later destroyed. The former Nobscot post office and library building, which also served as a railroad ticket sales office, has been restored near its original site. The Saxonville Branch – the only line in Framingham not connected to South Framingham – opened from Natick to Saxonville in July 1846. Two stations on the branch line were in Framingham. Cochituate station was at Commonwealth Road (Route 30) on Framingham's eastern border with Natick. The terminus station at Saxonville was a \\"typical B&A; granite station\\" located off Concord Street north of School Street (Route 126). The lightly-used line never saw more than three daily round trips; in 1936, passenger service was discontinued. A \\"bus\\" – in reality, a car driven by the Saxonville station agent – ran to Natick station until 1943. Neither station is extant, but the Saxonville roof may have been reused on a nearby carriage house which still stands. No stations other than the South Framingham hub were located on the Boston & Albany mainline within Framingham. The stations in Ashland (still- extant downtown station closed in 1960; nearby park-and-ride station opened in 2002) and West Natick (opened 1982) serve some peripheral sections of Framingham. Bus connections Eight of the 17 bus routes operated by the MetroWest Regional Transit Authority (MWRTA) serve Framingham station. Five routes (2, 3, 4, 7, Framingham Commuter Shuttle) stop at the \\"banana lot\\", a curved parking lot on the north side of the tracks. The Westborough Commuter Shuttle stops on Concord Street at Howard Street, while route 5 and 6 stop on Waverly Street on the south side of the tracks: The central hub for the MWRTA is the Blandin Hub in Framingham, to the east. Six of the MWRTA's numbered routes plus the Boston Hospital Shuttle serve Blandin Hub. Three numbered routes, all five commuter shuttles, and the Boston Hospital Shuttle serve Waverly Hub, to the east of the station. Station layout The station consists of two high level side platforms serving the two tracks. A footbridge near the end of the platform allows for commuters to easily switch between the platforms while still staying within the station site. A medium-sized parking lot is adjacent to the station, offering a total of 170 parking spaces. Grade crossings Concord Street grade crossing near the station Unlike most other mid-sized cities in Massachusetts, Framingham still has significant level crossings in the downtown area. The crossings at Beaver Street and Concord Street (Route 126) near the station are the first grade crossings on the Worcester Line heading westbound; there are only three others on the largely grade-separated line east of Worcester. The Concord Street crossing was one of the last in the state with a crossing guard; he was replaced by an automated system with grade crossing signals and road gates as warning devices in 1986. The crossing is problematic because passing freight trains often result in delays both on Route 126, as well as Route 135 which crosses it just south of the tracks. The frequent blockage of the crossing by passing trains reduces capacity in the intersection by 21% during the morning rush and 16% in the afternoon, resulting in delays and traffic jams in the downtown area. Increased service levels planned by the MBTA would result in morning capacity reduction of 34% and afternoon reduction of 28%. The first discussion of improving the intersection and grade crossing was a study in 1898, since which there have been about three dozen more. The most recent, a 2009 study of the downtown area, examined the possibility of depressing Route 126 under the grade crossing and intersection as well as several other alternatives including bypasses. The Route 126 depression was deemed to create barriers to walkability downtown, and the recommended alternative was to depress Route 135 under the intersection to prevent it from being affected by trains passing through the grade crossing. Funds have not yet become available for final design and construction. South of the station platforms, the remaining rarely- used stub of the Milford Branch crosses Waverly Street (Route 135) at grade. East of Concord Street, the Framingham Secondary also crosses Waverly Street at grade. Both crossings are only used by slow-moving freight trains; they have flashing signals but no gates.

It is one of the largest breeds, and jacks (donkey stallions) were bred to mares of the Poitevin horse breed to produce Poitevin mules, which were formerly in worldwide demand for agricultural and other work. The Baudet has a distinctive coat, which hangs in long, ungroomed locks or cadenettes. The Baudet developed in the former province of Poitou, possibly from donkeys introduced to the area by the Romans. They may have been a status symbol during the Middle Ages, and by the early 18th century, their physical characteristics had been established. A studbook for the breed was established in France in 1884, and the 19th and early 20th centuries saw them being used for the production of mules throughout Europe. During this same time, Poitou bloodlines were also used to develop other donkey breeds, including the American Mammoth Jack in the United States. Increasing mechanization in the mid-20th century saw a decline in the need for, and hence population of, the breed, and by 1977, a survey found only 44 members worldwide. Conservation efforts were begun by a number of public and private breeders and organizations, and by 2005 there were 450 purebred Poitou donkeys. History A Poitevin mule The exact origins of the Poitou breed are unknown, but donkeys and their use in the breeding of mules may have been introduced to the Poitou region of France by the Roman Empire. The Baudet de Poitou and the Mulassière (mule breeder) horse breed (also known as the Poitevin) were developed together for the use of producing superior mules. In the Middle Ages, owning a Poitou donkey may have been a status symbol among the local French nobility. It is not known when the Poitou's distinctive characteristics were gained but they seem to have been well-developed by 1717 when an advisor to King Louis XV described: > There is found, in northern Poitou, donkeys which are as tall as large > mules. They are almost completely covered in hair a half-foot long with legs > and joints as large as a those of a carriage horse. In the mid-1800s, Poitevin mules were \\"regarded as the finest and strongest in France\\", and between 15,000 and 18,000 were sold annually. In 1884, a studbook was established for the Poitou donkey in France. During the first half of the twentieth century, the mules bred by the Poitou and the Poitevin continued to be desired throughout Europe, and were called the \\"finest working mule in the world\\". Purchasers paid higher prices for Poitevin mules than for others, and up to 30,000 were bred annually in Poitou, with some estimates putting the number as high as 50,000. As mechanization increased around World War II, mules became outmoded, and population numbers for both mules and donkeys dropped dramatically. Poitou donkey and mule breeders were extremely protective of their breeding practices, some of which were \\"highly unusual and misguided.\\" Jacks were kept in closed-in stalls throughout the year once they had begun covering mares, in often unhygienic conditions. Once the mares had been covered, a folk belief held that if they were underfed, they would produce colts, which were more valuable, rather than fillies. This often led to mares being starved during their pregnancies. Colostrum, vital for foal development, was considered unhealthy and withheld from newborns. A lack of breeding records resulted in fertility problems, and there was a significant amount of foal mortality, due to jacks being used to cover horse mares before jennies of their own kind, resulting in late-born foals that were vulnerable to cold fall and winter temperatures. Despite these husbandry issues, one author, writing in 1883, stated that \\"mule-breeding is about the only branch of agricultural industry in which France has no rival abroad, owing its prosperity entirely to the zeal of those engaged in it.\\"  Conservation efforts  A breed census in 1977 found only 44 Poitou donkeys worldwide, and in 1980 there were still fewer than 80 animals. Conservation efforts were led by several public and private groups in France. In 1979, the Haras Nationaux, (the French national stud) and the Parc Naturel Regional du Marais Poitevin, working with private breeders, launched an effort to improve the genetics of the Poitou, develop new breeding techniques and collect traditional knowledge on the breed. In 1981, 18 large donkeys from Portugal were acquired for use in breeding Poitou donkeys. This preceded the creation of the Asinerie Nationale Experimentale, which opened in Charente-Maritime in Dampierre-sur-Boutonne in 1982, as an experimental breeding farm. The Parc also works to preserve the Poitevin horse breed. In 1988, the Association pour la Sauvegarde du Baudet du Poitou (SABAUD) was formed as a breeder network that focuses on marketing and fundraising for the breed, and in 1989 became the financial support arm of the Asinerie Nationale Experimentale. The Association des Éleveurs des Races Équine, Mulassière et Asine, Baudet du Poitou is the registering body for the Poitou donkey. The early conservation efforts were sometimes sidetracked as some breeders sold crossbred Poitous as purebreds, which are worth up to ten times as much. Forged pedigrees and registration papers were sometimes used to legitimize these sales. However, by the 1990s, DNA testing and microchip technology began to be used to identify and track purebred animals. Adult bourailloux Poitou The conservation efforts in the latter decades of the 20th century and the early years of the 21st were successful, and a 2005 survey revealed 450 purebred registered animals. This number dropped to just under 400 by 2011. The French studbook for the breed is split into two sections. The first, Livre A, is for purebred animals with documented Poitou parentage on both sides of their pedigree. The second, Livre B, is for animals with one purebred Poitou parent. The American Livestock Breeds Conservancy lists the Poitou as \\"Critical\\" on its Conservation Priority List, a category for breeds with less than 2,000 animals worldwide and less than 200 registrations annually in the US. In 2001, scientists in Australia successfully implanted a Poitou donkey embryo created by artificial insemination in the womb of a Standardbred mare. Worries that joint problems might prevent a healthy pregnancy in the foal's biological mother led to the initiative. The resultant foal became one of three Poitou donkeys in Australia. The procedure was unusual because it is often difficult for members of one Equus species to accept implanted embryos from another species in the same genus. In the United States Poitou donkey on a museum farm Nordhorn. Historical records exist of several sets of exports of Poitous from France to the US during the 19th and early 20th centuries, including a 1910 import of 10 donkeys. Most of these were integrated into the generic pool of donkey bloodstock, rather than being bred pure. During this time, Poitous were used in the creation of the American Mammoth Jack breed. Due to high purchase and transportation costs, the breed played a smaller role in the development of the Mammoth Jack than some breeders would have preferred. Imports to the US continued until at least 1937, when a successful breeding jack name Kaki, who stood high, was brought to the country. The 1940s through the 1960s saw a dearth of Poitou imports, and only a few arrived between 1978 and the 1990s. By 1996, there were estimated to only be around 30 Poitous in North America. In 1996, Debbie Hamilton, an American, founded the Hamilton Rare Breeds Foundation on a farm in Hartland, Vermont, to breed Poitou donkeys. As of 2004, she owned 26 purebred and 14 partbred Poitous, making hers the largest Poitou breeding operation in the United States, and the second largest in the world, behind the French government-sponsored experimental farm. Hamilton works with French officials toward the preservation of the breed, and has received praise from French veterinarians, who appreciate her technical and financial contributions to the breed. Techniques for using cryopreservation to develop a sperm bank for Poitou donkeys have been in development in France since at least 1997, but Hamilton has pioneered the use of artificial insemination using frozen semen in the breed, in order to use genetic material from France to improve Poitou herds in the US. The North American Baudet de Poitou Society, organized by the American Donkey and Mule Society, is the American registry for the breed, coordinating with French officials for inspections and registrations of American-bred Poitou stock.  Characteristics  The Baudet is a large breed; among other European donkeys only the Andalucian donkey reaches a similar size. In order to breed large mules, the original breeders of the Poitou chose animals with large features, such as ears, heads and leg joints. The ears developed to such an extent that their weight sometimes causes them to be carried horizontally. Minimum height is for jacks and for jennies. They have large, long heads, strong necks, long backs, short croups and round haunches. The limb joints and feet are large, and the legs strong. The temperament has been described as \\"friendly, affectionate and docile\\". In Poitou, the coat of the Baudet was traditionally – and deliberately – left ungroomed; with time, it formed , long shaggy locks somewhat like dreadlocks. These sometimes became so long that they reached the ground; a Baudet with such a long coat was termed or . The shaggy coat is such a dominant trait that even a 1/8 Poitou donkey may exhibit it. The coat is dark bay, ranging from dark brown to black; it may also be , in which the silver-grey surround of the mouth and eyes has a reddish border. The underbelly and the insides of the thighs are pale. It may not display either rubican markings (\\"white ticking\\"), nor a dorsal mule- stripe.  Use  The Baudet was traditionally used only for breeding mules; the word means \\"donkey sire\\", but it used to describe the breed as a whole. With the decline of mule-breeding, some may be used for agricultural work, for driving or for riding.

ASAN advocates for the inclusion of autistic people in decisions that affect them, including: legislation, depiction in the media, and disability services. ASAN has protested Autism Speaks for promoting policies that are harmful to autistic people, for promoting stigma against autistic people, and for systematically excluding autistic people from debates about issues that affect them. ASAN has also protested the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center, a school for autistic and special needs students that has been condemned by the United Nations for torture. ASAN is based in Washington, D.C., where it advocates for the United States government to adopt legislation and policies that positively impact autistic people.  Services  The Autistic Self Advocacy Network provides community organizing, self-advocacy support, and public policy advocacy and education for autistic youth and adults, as well as working to improve the general public's understanding of autism and related conditions. The organization is \\"run by and for autistic adults\\". ASAN's mission statement says that autistic people are equal to everyone else, and important and necessary members of society. ASAN also maintains a network of 25 local chapters based in different states, with three chapter affiliates in Canada and Australia.  History  The Autistic Self Advocacy Network was co-founded on November 13, 2006, by its former president, Ari Ne'eman, and former Board of Trustees member and Vice Chair of Development, Scott Michael Robertson. By 2009, ASAN had 15 chapters. ASAN's early work mostly focused on fighting the use of aversives, restraint, and seclusion in special education; in December 2007, they spoke out publicly against Autism Speaks, and against the NYU Child Study Center's Ransom Notes ad campaign, which compared autism, ADHD, OCD, and eating disorders to kidnappers holding children hostage. This counter-campaign put ASAN on the public's radar and has been referred to as the neurodiversity movement's coming of age. ASAN continues to protest Autism Speaks. On July 18, 2016, Ari Ne'eman announced that he would resign as president of the Autistic Self Advocacy Network, to be replaced by Julia Bascom in early 2017. Bascom now holds the title of ASAN President. In 2020, ASAN published a statement supporting the FDA's ban on the electric skin shock devices used to torture children and adults with disabilities at the Judge Rotenberg Center.  Activism  The Autistic Self Advocacy Network promotes autism awareness and acceptance through public policy initiatives, research reform and cross- disability collaboration, community outreach, college advocacy, publishing, and employment initiatives. ASAN has also supported initiatives to raise the minimum wage. ASAN has opposed federal contractors paying disabled people sub- minimum wage in 2014. Their campaign to prevent workers from being paid sub- minimum wage by federal contractors was successful. In addition, ASAN has also been involved in helping businesses hire autistic individuals. Scientific issues ASAN is the Autistic community partner for the Academic Autistic Spectrum Partnership In Research and Education (AASPIRE). The AASPIRE project brings together the academic community and the Autistic community, in a research format called community-based participatory research, to develop and perform research projects relevant to the needs of Autistic adults. ASAN has been critical of statements made which falsely link vaccines and autism. According to ASAN, research suggests that autism has always existed at its current levels in the population. In 2018, ASAN published an open letter to American Speech–Language–Hearing Association opposing their position statement that facilitated communication (FC) and rapid prompting method (RPM) are scientifically discredited, claiming that more research on those methods is worthwhile. ASAN also lists two facilitated communication users as members of its Board of Trustees. Special calendar events ASAN's chapters work collaboratively with the national branch on nationwide projects; an example of this is Day of Mourning, an event on March 1 where local chapters of ASAN, as well as independent groups, host candlelight vigils in remembrance of disabled people murdered by their caregivers. The first campaign was suggested by Zoe Gross of California, who had heard of a case where a young autistic man was murdered by his mother, who later committed suicide. The vigils honor people with all kinds of disabilities. In April 2013, as part of Autism Acceptance Month – a counter-movement against the cure-focused Light It Up Blue and Autism Awareness Month movements – ASAN launched an Autism Acceptance Month web site. Publications ASAN published a book for autistic people in college, called Navigating College Handbook. The book was considered \\"the first of its kind\\". In 2012, ASAN began the annual Autism Campus Inclusion (ACI) Summer Institute, a week-long workshop teaching Autistic students to engage in activism and advocacy on their campuses. Disability rights activist Lydia Brown is an alumn of the leadership program.Baldwin, Amy (2015). \\"The job prob: How learning to lead can help you succeed\\". Student Health 101. The Loud Hands Project, a transmedia publishing effort for curating and hosting submissions by Autistic people about voice, has also been active during 2012, in the form of a Kickstarter campaign and an anthology, both founded and organized by Julia Bascom. Later in 2012, ASAN also published the anthology Loud Hands: Autistic People, Speaking, which features several dozen essays by autistic neurodiversity activists including Jim Sinclair and Ari Ne'eman. Work with Sesame Workshop In 2015, ASAN worked with Sesame Workshop to create an autistic character for Sesame Street, named Julia. In August 2019, ASAN announced it had ended its partnership with Sesame Street after it began to associate with Autism Speaks. ASAN described the materials produced is association with Autism Speaks as \\"incredibly harmful information [mixed] with useful information with little to no distinction\\", including theories and narratives about autism that are not scientifically supported, and medical advice not backed by scientific research. ASAN reports that it discussed the harmful implications of these ideas with the producers of \\"Sesame Street\\", and that the producers acknowledged that the ideas were harmful but would not reconsider their collaboration with Autism Speaks. Opposition to Kevin and Avonte's Law ASAN opposed Kevin and Avonte's Law, which would have provided money to fight wandering behavior in autistic children. ASAN was originally neutral, but after several modifications were made, including an amendment that would have allowed for the installation of tracking devices on people with disabilities, ASAN and several other disabilities rights groups opposed the proposed law over privacy concerns. Additionally, Ne'eman said that \\"The use of the 'wandering' label on adults will enable abuse and restrict the civil rights of Americans with Disabilities\\" and that it would \\"make it easier for school districts and residential facilities to justify restraint and seclusion in the name of treatment.\\" As a result, Congress did not pass Kevin and Avonte's Law. Later, a revised version of Kevin and Avonte's Law passed which did not include the language ASAN had objected to.  Protests = Autism Speaks  In 2009, ASAN and over 60 other disability advocacy groups condemned Autism Speaks for lack of representation, and for exploitative and unethical practices. Before 2015, John Elder Robison was the only autistic person ever to server on Autism Speaks board of directors. He later resigned in protest against the organization. In 2015, Autism Speaks made a commitment to provide better representation by appointing two autistic people to its 26 member board of directors. ASAN criticized this move insufficient, citing: continues systematic exclusion of autistic people from positions of leadership at Autism Speaks; continued misuse of funds, particularly to support research for a cure rather than to support for autistic people; and continued use of harmful messages in advertising campaigns designed to promote stigma against autistic people. ASAN stated: \\"Until Autism Speaks makes significant changes to their practices and policies of fighting against the existence of autistic people, these appointments to the board are superficial changes.\\"  Judge Rotenberg Center  ASAN has strongly opposed the Judge Rotenberg Center, a school that has been condemned by the United Nations for torture. In 2012, they published a seven part series called \\"The Judge Rotenberg Center on Trial\\", which covered a civil lawsuit brought against the center by the mother of Andre McCollins, a students who was abused there. In 2020, ANAN supported the FDA's ban on the Graduated Electronic Decelerator, an electric shock device that the Judge Rotenberg Center used to torture its students. ASAN has also been critical of organizations that have supported the practices of the Judge Rotenberg Center, such as the Association for Behavior Analysis International.  Criticism  In response to a local chapter which protested billboards in Seattle that advocated \\"wiping out\\" autism, Arzu Forough of the organization Washington Autism Alliance & Advocacy claimed that coverage of this event could have misled people about the effects of autism. She claimed that ASAN promoted the idea that autistics have trivial difficulties, obscuring the level of support that some autistics need. In 2017, supporters of ASAN criticized actor William Shatner for his support for Autism Speaks. Shatner responded by claiming \\"I supported an awareness day hashtag that appears to be scorned by a group that doesn't want awareness.\\" Shatner described his views on ASAN's activism by stating that instead of making defeating Autism Speaks their main goal, ASAN should advocate for its own views. Bruce Hall, a legally blind photographer, has opposed cuts to disability services that were endorsed by ASAN, claiming that more services are needed.

Due to various historical anomalies, several stations and properties that are officially part of Queensland are south of the 29 degrees south parallel, marking the official border. Three of these can be seen easily on Google Maps near Cameron Corner,Google Maps view of the area where the New South Wales Lands Department surveyor John Brewer Cameron, who spent two years from 1880 marking the border between NSW and Queensland, erected a post in September 1880. The cause of this has been traced to surveyors' errors, variously due to differences between the Francis Edward Roberts and Isaiah Rowland survey between 1863 and 1865 and other surveys performed since then. The first discovery of incorrectly allocated land was in 1884 when surveyor Johnson was instructed to survey a Conditional Purchase (No. 83–10) adjacent to the border at Tweed Heads for the NSW Government.See Page 11 The area he surveyed had already been allocated and marked by the QLD Government surveyors. Other issues include historical land grants. Areas surveyed by F. E. Roberts were discovered, in the 1930s to have been allocated incorrectly by the QLD Government. After attempts in 1933 to have the area resumed by NSW, the NSW government decided that as the incorrect survey had been accepted by both governments, it was unlikely to win in any court case, and accepted these areas as part of QLD. The Queensland Government resumed 20 areas from 10 titles totalling approximately 4 hectares of land that extended across the 29 degrees south parallel.Only available on MicrofilmSee Page 12 Due to the rural area and small size of these encroachments (20 acres), this hasn't caused any significant or legislative issues as has occurred previously with other border encroachment issues globallyBhutan accuses China of EncroachmentSaudi Arabia and Yemen Encroachments or nationally, such as the South Australia-Victoria border dispute.

A candlestick telephone is also often referred to as a desk stand, an upright, or a stick phone. Candlestick telephones featured a mouth piece (transmitter) mounted at the top of the stand, and a receiver (ear phone) that was held by the user to the ear during a call. When the telephone was not in use, the receiver rested in the fork of the switch hook protruding to the side of the stand, thereby disconnecting the audio circuit from the telephone network. Design and features Candlestick telephones were designed in a great variety of styles with varying features. Most recognizable, candlesticks featured a base with a vertical cylindrical neck extending upright for up to in length. At the top of the stand was mounted a carbon microphone (transmitter) to speak into, and a switch hook extending sideways upon which an ear piece (receiver) was hung. In order to make or answer a telephone call, the user lifted the receiver off the switch hook, thereby activating an internal switch connecting the telephone to the telephone line. Candlestick telephones required the nearby installation of a subscriber set (subset, ringer box), which housed the ringer to announce incoming calls and the electric circuitry (capacitor, induction coil, signaling generator, connection terminals) to connect the set to the telephone network. When automatic telephone exchanges were introduced, the base of a candlestick also featured a rotary dial, used for signaling the telephone number of an intended call recipient. Production Candlestick telephones were produced in various models by many manufacturers. The main producers of these telephones were Western Electric (a unit of AT&T;), Automatic Electric Co. (later acquired by GTE), Kellogg Switchboard & Supply Company, and Stromberg-Carlson. The first tube shaft candlestick telephone was the Western Electric #20B Desk Phone patented in 1904. In the 1920s and 1930s, telephone technology shifted to the design of more efficient desk top telephones that featured a handset with receiver and transmitter elements in one unit, making the use of a telephone more convenient. However, despite ceasing new production, many candlestick telephones remained in operation, maintained by the telephone companies, throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s. Many retro- style versions of the candlestick telephone were made long after the original phones were obsolete by companies such as Radio Shack and the Crosley Radio company. Successor telephones When Western Electric had sufficiently developed modern handset design in the 1920s, the Western Electric candlesticks were superseded by a series of new desktop models, starting with the A1 mount in the mid 1920s. This was essentially a candlestick telephone that had its vertical tube-shaft shortened to about in height above the round base, and had a cradle on top of it, designed to hold a combined handset with both the receiver and the transmitter in the same unit. The cradle contained a plunger that operated the hookswitch in the base below. The A1 was only distributed for a very short time until the B-type telephone mount (model 102 telephone) was completed in 1927, a streamlined design that replaced the tube- shaft with a sculpted cone shape. By 1930 this round base was redesigned into the oval-footprint D-mounting to avoid instability of the unit when dialing. At the same time the electric circuitry was upgraded to produce the model 202 telephone, which reduced the strong sidetone characteristic of earlier designs. Accessories The Hush-A-Phone was like a mini megaphone created in 1920 for slipping over the candlestick phone. Later design influences The Ericofon, or Cobra Phone is a plastic one-piece telephone, in the candlestick/upright style, created by the Ericsson Company and marketed throughout the second half of the 20th century. It was the first commercially marketed telephone design to incorporate the dial and headset into a single unit. Because of its styling, and influence on future telephone design, the Ericofon is considered one of the most significant industrial designs of the 20th century and is in the collection of Museum of Modern Art.

Yacht transport is an alternative to the traditional passaging (sailing or motoring) to reach desired destinations around the globe. Transport when compared to passaging is cost-effective, safer and improves availability. For many dedicated sailors, passaging or an ocean crossing is a rite of passage, but it comes with many risks and expenses. For many serious cruisers, financial, business and family considerations argue against the long-term full-time dedication that ocean crossings require. Yacht transport becomes an alternative when the destination and cruising (maritime) is more important than the passaging. Yacht transport generally eliminates costly, time-consuming, and dangerous difficult ocean crossings, opening up cruising to more people. Container cruising, one approach to yacht transport, is significantly less expensive and has greater flexibility with respect to timing and destinations. The drawback to container cruising is that there are a limited number of yachts that have the necessary to fit in the standard container. Transport methods=Overland transport Small boats being transported short distances are often moved using private or commercial trailers. As the boat size and the over-land distances increase, commercial trailer services are typically employed by boat owners to move vessels. Insurance coverage, transport permits, trailer safety and proper preparation and loading of the vessel and contents are aspects commercial boat/yacht services provide. Semi-submersible ships (SSS) Semi-submersible ships were developed to move large (project) cargoes, but have now been adapted for yacht shipping. These ships are semi-submersible. This means that by ballasting, they can submerge their cargo holds. Yachts motor under their own power into the flooded cargo holds to load. Once all the yachts are in position and secured, divers weld hull supports into place. The ship deballasts and sails away. At discharge port arrival, the process is reversed, with the ship ballasting, allowing the yachts to exit. Semi-submersible shipping is arranged by the owners. Deck cargo Yachts can be shipped as deck cargo. Yachts are loaded directly from the water or from shore. Yachts are loaded by ship or by shore cranes in cradles either supplied by the carrier or the owner. For conventional deck cargo shipping, the rigging is left intact. Deck cargo shipping is normally arranged directly with the shipping lines or with brokers who specialize in yacht deck cargo shipping. Container shipment Yachts are also transported by container ships. Because container freight is sold on the basis of total enclosed volume, efforts are made to decrease that volume, including de-rigging the boat. If a yacht meets the restrictions imposed by container sizing, typically x x , container shipping is an alternative. Container shipping is arranged through freight forwarders. Costs include the cost of preparation, cradles, documentation, and customs and other government fees. Container shipment costs are almost independent of distance shipped and depend more on imbalances in container locations. Scheduling The Semi-submersible ships travel on fixed schedules over popular routes such as to and from the US, Europe, the Caribbean, and Pacific Ocean destinations. While in theory, deck cargoes can be arranged between any two ports and at any time, costs are reduced if a number of yachts are shipped together. Because most ships are non-US flag carriers, they are forbidden by law to transport cargoes between US ports. To comply with the law, they load or discharge in Canada, the Bahamas or Mexico. Container shipping offers complete flexibility with respect to ports and timing. Security The locked and sealed container provides the best overall security. Since the semi-submersible ships are dedicated to yacht transport, they also offer a secure environment. In addition to theft, another potential problem is partial or total losses at sea. Probability of losses is low, reflected by the lower cost of insurance. The increasing cost of fuel, the convenience, and the ability to go anywhere make yacht transport an attractive alternative.

It was redesignated the 628th Tank Battalion after the end of the war, and today exists as the 103rd Armor Regiment. Early service What would become the battalion was formed on 10 July 1941 as the 28th Infantry Division Provisional Antitank Battalion, and on 15 December was redesignated as the 628th Tank Destroyer Battalion (constituted 3 December 1941 in the Army of the United States), in line with the reorganization of the anti-tank force. On 7 March 1942, the battalion was redesignated as a National Guard unit and allotted to the Pennsylvania National Guard. During training, in 1943, the battalion provided a cadre to form the nucleus of the 648th Tank Destroyer Battalion. The 628th remained in the United States until January 1944, when it was shipped to the United Kingdom aboard the Aquitania. From 11 April to 5 July, it operated three marshaling camps in southern England, providing accommodation and administration for combat troops of the 1st and the 29th Divisions being prepared for the Normandy landings. France M10 and crew in Dreux, c. 16 August The battalion landed in Normandy on 30 July, equipped with M10 tank destroyers. After a brief period in camp, it was attached to the newly arrived 5th Armored Division, and began operations on 2 August, with first contact with an enemy force on 4 August. In order to co-operate more closely with the 5th Armored, the battalion was split up, with one company going to each of the division's Combat Commands. The force moved south through Avranches and then southwest to Le Mans, before pushing north on 10 August to help close the Falaise Pocket. On 11 August a Panzer IV was destroyed, the first of the battalion's tank kills, and the same night, the rearguard of Company A encountered a German column, and in a close-range action accounted for eight vehicles and 240 enemy troops; a sergeant of the company received both the Silver Star and the Croix de Guerre for this action, giving the battalion its first tank kill and its first combat decoration on the same day. The battalion headed eastwards on 15 August, briefly crossing the Eure River on the 17th. The commanding officer, Lt. Col. Hernandez, was killed on 20 August whilst observing indirect fire, and succeeded by his executive officer, Major Gallagher; in the same action, two Panzer V tanks were destroyed for the loss of one M10, the first tank destroyer lost in action by the battalion. After operating along the Seine for several days, the battalion withdrew southeast to rest on the 25th. On 27 August, 5th Armored was detached from the XV Corps and ordered to drive east to the Belgian border; the battalion left camp on the 30th and, passing through Paris, arrived on the border late on the night of 2 September. The battalion was reorganized and attached in its entirety to Combat Command R, before the division moved south to Sedan and eastwards to Luxembourg, crossing the border on 9 September and arriving at the German border on the 11th. Siegfried Line Tank Destroyer Battalion (SP) Structure - March 1944 On the 13th, the division began to push against the Siegfried Line fortifications around Wallendorf, aiming to push through to Bitburg. The first elements of the battalion crossed onto German soil on the 13th, with the remainder of the battalion crossing on the 15th and establishing a command post six miles inside Germany. The battalion came under a strong counter- attack on the 17th, with Lt. Rennbaum of B Company receiving the Distinguished Service Cross for his work in evacuating his platoon under heavy fire. The 19th saw further intensification of the fighting, with artillery fire rising to the point where it was decided to withdraw all units back across the river into Luxembourg; the last element of the battalion left Germany at 5 am on the 20th. In this final day of combat, eleven German tanks were definitely destroyed by the battalion, with a further seven probably destroyed but not confirmed. Through October and November 1944, the battalion remained in defensive positions, moving northwards to Faymonville in eastern Belgium in early October. Throughout this time, it mostly carried out indirect fire missions; Company C, attached to Combat Command B, was deployed for the attack on Aachen, but not committed to combat. The battalion moved eastwards into Germany, billeted near Kalterherberg, in late October; shortly thereafter, on 1 November, the battalion was re-equipped with new M36 tank destroyers. In late November, Combat Command R, along with Company C, was detached from the 5th Armored to provide support to the 8th Infantry Division in the Battle of Hurtgen Forest; on 3 December, Combat Command A, with Company A, was likewise attached to the 4th Infantry, with both very heavy fighting – at one point, Company C was reduced to only one M-36 out of twelve able to operate. The battalion was strafed by Bf 109s on the 3rd; two were downed by anti-aircraft fire, the first aircraft the battalion had destroyed. On the 8th, plans were made to pull the battalion out of the line to prepare for a crossing of the Roer River, with companies B and C remaining in action for the time being. Battle of the Bulge On 17 December, the scale of the German offensive in the Ardennes was becoming clear; the battalion was immediately ordered to provide anti-paratroop patrols along the divisional supply lines, and on the 19th was detached from the 5th Armored and attached to the 78th Infantry Division in XIX Corps, north of the main offensive area. On 23 December, when it became apparent that the line north of the \\"bulge\\" was stable, the battalion was detached from the 78th Division and attached to 3rd Armored Division in VII Corps, deployed on the northern side of the German salient; it arrived in place in the early afternoon of the 24th, and took up defensive positions. After a brief encounter with German infantry on the 24th, combat began in the early hours of Christmas Day; a tank destroyer of Company B knocked out two Panther tanks at 25 yards range, causing the opposing force to withdraw and avoid the area. The battalion remained on the defensive until the 3rd Armored was withdrawn into reserve, and on 1 January was attached to the 82nd Airborne Division for eleven days to help clear the area west of the Salm River; during this period, the battalion lost four M36s and fourteen men, destroying six tanks – including two Tiger II tanks. Advance into Germany On 11 January the battalion was attached to the 75th Infantry Division, but left them on the 16th, without having made contact with the enemy, and moved into XVIII Airborne Corps Reserve. On 27 January the battalion was once again attached to its old partner, the 5th Armored Division, and joined them to rest and prepare for a crossing of the Roer River; Company A was detached to join the divisional artillery, and during the four weeks of preparations fired two thousand rounds of indirect fire. On 23 February the attack began, with Company B crossing the Roer at Linnich on the 25th, and the remainder of the battalion following the next day. The division then swung northwards through the Rhineland, reaching the west bank of the Rhine on 10 March. From the 13th to the 29th, the battalion fired 1500 rounds of harassing fire at targets in the Ruhr, on the far bank. On 30 March the companies were assigned to combat commands in preparation for offensive operations, and crossed the river on the 31st, over a pontoon bridge at Wesel; the final breakout had begun. On 2 April, the division bypassed Münster, arriving at the Wesser River shortly thereafter and pausing until 8 April, when the river was crossed at Hamelin. The division moved north-east, passing to the south of Hannover and reaching the River Elbe on the 11th. Whilst the division was consolidating its position on the west bank, intelligence reports suggested that the Clausewitz Panzer Division had broken out from the Berlin area, and was heading south in order to cut American supply lines and join up with other units in the Harz Mountains. In order to counter this threat, the division moved west, leaving Combat Command A (with Company A) to cover the Elbe. A divisional supply train was ambushed on the 16th, losing several vehicles; among them was a truck from the battalion, carrying the unit standard. This, however, was recaptured the next day. On the 23rd, a Panzer V tank was knocked out, the fifty-sixth and final tank destroyed by the battalion. After two weeks of mopping-up operations, the region was deemed clear, and the companies reverted to battalion command on 25 April; the following day, the battalion moved to take up occupation duties in the Peine region of Lower Saxony, where it was located at the end of the war. By the end of the war, the Battalion had accounted for 60 tanks and self-propelled guns, as well as 30 pieces of artillery and over a hundred other vehicles, with over 1200 enemy killed and 1500 prisoners taken. Later service The battalion was inactivated on 14 November 1945. In May 1946 it was reactivated and redesignated as the 628th Tank Battalion, under which title it saw service in Europe for three years during the 1950s. In 1959 it joined with elements of the 110th Infantry Regiment and the 108th and 166th Field Artillery Battalions to form the 103rd Armor Regiment, a parent regiment in the Combat Arms Regimental System.

It gives the Susquehanna recreational depth south of the Taylor Bridge. Turbulence downstream of the dam contrasts sharply with the usually placid, lake-like river above the dam. In spite of the dam the Susquehanna is often just a few feet deep at Harrisburg, and it is possible (although not necessarily advisable) to walk from one shore to the other—a distance of nearly a mile—while keeping one's head well above water. Proposals have been made to raise the height of the dam in order to enhance the river’s navigability and recreational potential, although the suggestion remains controversial. The present structure has been criticized as creating currents downstream that can draw small boats upstream into the dam, an effect that has been cited in at least seventeen drownings. Solutions have been proposed, including the piling of stone or concrete debris south of the dam to disrupt the current, but have not been implemented.

While mechanically similar to its 1996-1999 predecessor, major revisions to the bodyshell of the sedan were done to alter its controversial styling as well as add interior room; it was available in four-door sedan and five-door station wagon models. The fourth-generation Taurus would be the final derived from the original 1986 model line. In 2004 and 2005, as part of its effort to increase the use of globally sourced platforms, Ford introduced the Volvo-developed Five Hundred and Mazda- developed Fusion to fill the slot of the Taurus in the Ford line (for non- fleet buyers, the Five Hundred also served as a replacement for the Crown Victoria). The Taurus nameplate returned in 2008, as Ford renamed the Five Hundred to increase its sales. Overview=Exterior 2000–2003 Ford Taurus SES sedan When the third-generation Taurus debuted, it was hurt by criticism of its design, which was formed from oval derived design elements. The design was very controversial, and it strongly limited the appeal of the car. As a result, for the fourth generation Taurus, Ford designed it with a more subdued, angular design, as part of Ford's New Edge styling, in hopes of increasing the car's appeal. Instead of sloping back, this car's trunk stood upright in a more traditional shape, which greatly increased trunk space. The roof was also raised into a more upright stance to increase headroom, which can be seen by the thicker C-pillar and larger area between the tops of the doors and the top of the roof. The front and rear clips were also redesigned on the Taurus and Sable sedans; all body panels were brand-new except the doors. Station wagons received the new front clips but from the firewall back they were essentially the same as the 1996-1999 wagons. The Taurus now had the turn signals integrated into the headlamps, similar to that of the previous generation Sable. The front bumper was also redesigned to include a larger front grille which, like the previous generation, contained a chrome bar running through the middle containing the Ford logo. The rear clip was redesigned with a larger trunk and trunklid, as mentioned above, as well as giving the Taurus two large taillights as opposed to the rear lightbar used in the previous generation cars. Mounted on the trunklid was a large chrome bar containing the Ford logo, like in the front. In 2003 for the 2004 model year, the front clip was slightly redesigned, and the Taurus got a new front bumper and grille. The grille was made smaller, with the chrome bar removed, replaced by just a large Ford logo in the center. The taillights were slightly redesigned, originally to include amber turn signals, but this was cancelled at the eleventh hour. Instead, the rear was given larger reverse lights, and the chrome bar above the license plate bracket was deleted. Interior As with the exterior, the interior was completely redesigned with a more conservative style, although some features from the previous cars were carried over. The dashboard had a more linear appearance, instead of curving around the driver. The \\"Integrated Control Panel\\" was carried over but enlarged, reshaped, and placed in the center of the dash instead of being tilted toward the driver. The Flip-Fold center console was also carried over but it was revamped as well. When folded out, it now rested against the floor instead of the dashboard, and had different cupholders and storage areas. Unlike previous Tauruses, this one offered rear cupholders that either slid or folded out of the front console, depending on which console the car was equipped with. This Taurus' interior was available in two configurations; a front bench seat with a column-mounted shifter and the Flip-Fold center console, or bucket seats with a traditional console and a floor-mounted shifter. The configuration for a steering column-mounted shifter and a center console, which made a brief return for 1999, had been dropped. The interior also contained many new safety features; side airbags, tether straps, and a glow in the dark trunk release mounted inside of the trunk. This interior also contained a new system which Ford called the \\" Advanced Personal Safety System\\". This system, at the time of a collision, would detect the driver and passenger's positions as well as seatbelt usage, and would inflate the airbags to match, possibly preventing airbag-related injuries. For 2004, the interior got a minor revision. This included a new steering wheel with a center airbag pad that was shaped like an upside-down taco and new gauges with a diagnostic center that would tell if there were any problems with the car, as well as average fuel economy. It also was able to perform a \\"system check\\" at the driver's request to make sure that the engine was functioning properly. Models and engines 2000-2003 Ford Taurus Rear View 2004 Ford Taurus sedan 2000–2003 Ford Taurus wagon The two 1999 models were carried over, and two more were added. The most basic model was the LX, with the SE as the mid priced model. Two new trim levels were offered for 2000: the SE Special Value Group and the top-end model SE Comfort. These new trim levels were renamed the following year to SES and SEL respectively. The SES and LX models were dropped in 2005, leaving the SE and SEL. The SEL line received a few upgrades for 2003, to give it a more upscale image. Among the changes were a new instrument cluster, wheels, as well as a slight redesign of the dash, with woodgrain replacing the black trim. It also got woodgrain on the steering wheel rim and around the power window switches on the front doors. Also in 2003, Ford created a Centennial Edition Taurus to celebrate Ford's 100th anniversary. This special Taurus included many extras, such as lighter wood trim, special leather seats, headlights with black accents, special wheels, a special leather case for the owner's manual, a leather jacket that said \\"Ford: 100 Years\\", a similar watch, and a letter from William Clay Ford, Jr. Production was limited to 4,000 units. For 2002, 2003 and 2004, the SES model received a \\"Sport\\" package, which consisted of five- spoked rims known as \\"slicers\\", and the Duratec engine standard. In addition, the exterior of the vehicle received Sport badging on the front quarter- panels, the chrome bar on the grille was changed to body color, the interior received two-toned cloth seats, a two-toned dash applique, special \\"Sport\\" floor mats, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. This model was only offered in four colors. The engines were carried over from the previous generation, with the Vulcan being the only available engine on the LX and SE, producing and of torque, and as the base engine on the SES. The Duratec engine was optional on the SES and standard on the SEL, producing . For 2005, with the LX and SES models being dropped, the Duratec was only available on the SEL, and in 2006 the Duratec was dropped altogether, with the Vulcan becoming the standard and only engine available on the SEL. Some pre-2004 Vulcans were mated to the four speed AX4S automatic transmission; all other Tauruses of this generation received the AX4N transmission. Variants=Mercury Sable 2000–2003 Mercury Sable 2004 Mercury Sable wagon The Mercury Sable, the sister model of the Taurus aimed at a more upscale audience, was also redesigned for 2000. Like with previous generations, the Sable shared all mechanical components with the Taurus with a unique body. The new Sable was also largely carried over from the previous model, with changes limited a new front fascia, rear fascia, wheels, a taller roof and trunk, and a new interior, though the interior was the same design of the Taurus with added woodgrain trim. Like with previous generations, the Sable offered the same powertrains and equipment as the Taurus. The Sable was again offered in GS and LS models in wagon and sedan body styles, with a new top-of-the-line LS Premium trim. An LS Platinum edition was also briefly offered. The Sable was updated in 2004 with a new grille, front bumper, steering wheel, instrument cluster, wheels and taillamps. The Sable was discontinued in 2005 and replaced by the Mercury Montego (which would be renamed as the Sable in 2008) and Mercury Milan. This generation of Sable was not sold in Canada, as the Mercury nameplate had been discontinued there by the 2000 model year. Initial discontinuation and nameplate revival This generation of Taurus saw a significant sales slump compared to its predecessors. Having already lost its status as the best selling car in America when it was surpassed by the Honda Accord and Toyota Camry in 1997, by 2005 it has fallen to fourth-place behind the Nissan Altima, which made Ford decide to discontinue the entire Taurus line.http://www.edmunds.com/car-reviews/top-10/top-10-best-selling-vehicles- for-2005.html Production of the Taurus wagon was discontinued on December 8, 2004; sedan retail sales halted after a short 2006 model year, and the Taurus became sold exclusively to fleets in the United States, while still being sold to retail customers in Canada. Production ended on October 27, 2006, as Ford idled the Atlanta plant, as part of its \\"The Way Forward\\" restructuring plan. The last Ford Taurus rolled off the assembly line around 7:00am, destined for delivery to S. Truett Cathy, owner of Chick-fil-A. Mr. Cathy's original restaurant was located across from the Ford Atlanta plant. There was no official event or function of any kind to mark the end of production. The Taurus was replaced in Ford's lineup by the Five Hundred and Fusion sedans, while the Taurus wagon was replaced by the Freestyle crossover SUV. The last Taurus sedan was an SEL model like this one. The 2008 Ford Five Hundred prototype, which was renamed \\"Taurus\\" upon Alan Mulally's request The discontinuation of the Taurus sparked debate given its once-strong position in the market and Ford's well-publicized financial problems at the time. Analysts, customers and some interviewed Ford employees criticized the company for failing to invest in the car and keep it competitive, instead focusing all of its resources on developing and marketing trucks and SUVs. A USA Today editorial entitled \\"How Ford starved its Taurus\\" noted that the Taurus' death was part of a broader trend of the Detroit Big Three willingly abandoning once-successful nameplates and divisions in search of \\"the next big thing\\", while their foreign competitors have been gaining market share by continuously improving their veteran nameplates. This criticism was echoed by Autoblog, which held the Taurus up as an example of how Ford abandoned its successful products to chase emerging trends to varying degrees of success, a practice they blamed for Ford's struggles at the time. The Truth About Cars similarly lamented how Ford neglected the Taurus to the point where it became a \\"rental car\\". Newly-hired Ford CEO Alan Mulally expressed similar opinions, telling the Associated Press the decision \\"perplexed\\" him when he learned about it; he recalled asking subordinates, \\"How can it go away? It's the best selling car in America!\\" As the successor Five Hundred was struggling in the marketplace, Mulally viewed the decision to discontinue the Taurus as a \\"mistake that needed to be fixed\\", noting, \\"The customers want it back. They didn’t want it to go away. They wanted us to keep improving it.\\" At the time, Ford had already unveiled a face-lifted Five Hundred at the 2007 North American International Auto Show, which had revised styling and a more powerful engine. Partially blaming the Five Hundred's struggles on its name, Mulally decided that the revised vehicle should be marketed as the Taurus, the name he believed the Five Hundred sedan should have used from the beginning as he believed Ford was better off continuing to use its older nameplates that maintained decent brand equity rather than trying to build up new ones. The revised Five Hundred and Freestyle were showcased as the Taurus and Taurus X, respectively, at the 2007 Chicago Auto Show and went on sale that summer.

(May 24, 1943 – July 30, 2005), born Carl Edward Migwans, made Canadian art history as the first artist of Native Ancestry (Ojibwe), to have his work purchased by the National Gallery of Canada as Contemporary Art. A major retrospective of his work, mounted by the National Gallery of Canada, was exhibited in 2010, recognizing Beam as one of Canada's most important artists. He worked in various photographic mediums, mixed media, oil, acrylic, spontaneously scripted text on canvas, works on paper, Plexiglas, stone, cement, wood, handmade ceramic pottery, and found objects, in addition to etching, lithography, and screen process.  Personal life  Carl Beam was born Carl Edward Migwans on May 24, 1943, in M'Chigeeng First Nation, to father Edward Cooper and mother Barbara Migwans. His mother is the daughter of Dominic Migwans, who was the Chief of the Ojibways of West Bay (later renamed M'Chigeeng First Nation) when Beam was born. \\"The Beam family's true name derives from miigwaans which means little feather or bird.\\"Virginia Eichorn, It's All Relative Catalog, 2005, p. 5 His father was an American soldier from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania , in the 77th Armor Regiment during World War II; he died as a prisoner-of-war in Bad Soden, Nazi Germany.Ann Beam He recounted to his daughter, artist Anong Migwans Beam, that he was predominantly raised by his grandparents.Ann Beam in conversation with Anong Beam, Manitoulin Island, 2008 His exceptional qualities were observed by his elders, and he was given the name \\"Ahkideh\\", derived from the Ojibwe language word for \\"one who is brave\\".\\"Ann Beam in conversation with Anong Beam, Manitoulin Island, 2008 He was sent to Garnier Residential School, in Spanish, Ontario, from the age of ten until eighteen. Beam married his first wife in the early 1960s. They had five children, Clinton, Veronica, Laila, Carl Jr., and Jennifer. The marriage was later annulled. Beam married Ann Elena Weatherby, and they hade daughter Anong. Beam died on July 30, 2005, in his home on M'chigeeng Reserve on Manitoulin Island, Ontario from complications due to diabetes. Education After working at a variety of jobs, from construction work on the Toronto subway, to working as a millwright in Wawa, Ontario, Beam entered Kootenay School of Art (1971). He went on to earn a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Victoria in 1974, and entered into post-graduate studies at the University of Alberta, (1975–76). He left the University of Alberta over a dispute about his thesis on native art, and returned to Ontario. Early work The direction of Carl Beam's visual style was firmly established by the late seventies. In 1979 Beam met and married his wife, Ann Beam. \\"In developing his work over the years, Beam has been accompanied by his wife, Ann, herself an artist and a former teacher at the Art Gallery of Ontario. Often they have worked as collaborators\\".Joan Murray, The Whale of Our Being Catalogue, 2002, p.4 At this time he incorporated multiple photographic images onto a single picture plane. \\"He disregarded the illusory deep space of Renaissance depiction, in favour of a flat tableau, where a dialogue of multiple images could take place\\". At this time his photographic imagery was achieved primarily via screen process, photo-etching, Polaroid instant prints, and a solvent transfer technique also used by Robert Rauschenberg. Living in the Southwestern United States In 1980, Beam and his wife, Ann, and daughter, Anong, moved to Arroyo Seco, New Mexico to live and work. \\"We developed a dialogue together in everyday living, politics, world events, ceramic technique, painting, and all things art, that would continue for the next 26 years\\".Ann Beam, in conversation with Anong Beam, Manitoulin Island, 2008 Said Beam of the time \\"It was in the southwest years later with Ann and Anong, who was a baby, that I saw my first Mimbres bowl, or rather a cupboard full of Mimbres bowls in a gallery on the square in downtown Santa Fe, New Mexico. Some were completely intact, some had been restored, but all shared a bold adventurous design. When I discovered they were done 1,000 years ago, I was completely surprised.\\"Carl Beam, It's All Relative Catalogue, 2005, p.8 Beam and his wife Ann exhibited their ceramic work together in The Painted Pottery of Ann and Carl Beam at the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM. Ceramic works and pottery Beam minored in ceramic pottery at the Kootenay School of Art. Despite having received top notch training, he found he lacked the ability to express himself as compared to with canvas or paper. Beam abandoned pottery as an art form but only temporarily. Years later in 1980 while living in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Beam again became interested in handmade pottery via his exposure to Santa Clara pottery and Mimbres bowls as were made by the Anasazi who lived in the area centuries before. In the words of Ann Beam, \\"It was the Santa Clara blackwares that got us first\\" \\"It's All Relative\\", Exhibition Catalogue, Virginia Eichorn, October 2003. Beam became excited with the adventurous and bold designs he observed in these works. Eventually he met Rose Montaya who further exposed him to her techniques and those passed down from her mother. Having learned much from Rose, Beam was able to find his own clay and paint stones, fire outside with dried dung or wood, and experiment extensively – about 70% of the early works were lost due to trial and error – all works were handmade without a wheel, often unglazed and polished with a stone. Figure 1 - Inside of handmade pottery by Carl Beam Figure 2 - Outside of handmade pottery by Carl Beam His Mimbres bowls were fabricated as a modern version of the ancient Anasazi ones - on the interior they were generally cream colored and quite smooth whereas the exterior appeared almost disregarded and less important (see Figures 1 and 2). Having studied all available exemplars found in museums, art galleries, shops, books, and otherwise, Beam's contemporary versions were largely influenced by the materials and sophisticated art dialogue present in the Anasazi works he saw. Also in the Anasazi tradition, Beam's bowls typically featured a bold design around the rim with his own unique images placed in the center. The result of his and Ann's early work was an exhibition in 1982 entitled \\"The Painted Pottery of Ann and Carl Beam\\" at the Maxwell Museum of Anthropology of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque,Joan Murray, The What of Our Being catalog, 2002 with other shows to follow later. Beam preferred the Mimbres bowl because it was a form conducive to his creative expression: \\"Finally, one form I could use to be absolutely creative in … the hemispherical quality of a large bowl still excites me like no cup, tea pot, plate or other clay shape can do…it is a universe unto itself where anything can happen – the designs are limitless.\\" Beam continued to work on and off in pottery, creating bowls, snake pots and other handmade creations almost always decorated with his designs and images. The raven is featured prominently in many of his works – \\"Migwans\\", Beam's family name, means \\"feather\\" or \\"bird\\". His works also feature news events (such as the Anwar Sadat assassination) or self-portraits or the shaman figure and family, a theme often returned to (seen in Figure 1) Beam also shared the techniques learned and developed with others including his cousin David Migwans, now an accomplished artist living in M'Chigeeng First Nation, Manitoulin Island. Return to Canada Although he had achieved a level of success in the United States, with art dealers in both Taos, and Santa Fe, Beam returned to Canada, where he felt his work had an important contribution to make. \\"A return to Canada in 1983 at first meant no change in format: one ceramic work by Beam of a shaman family, in the collection of the Woodland Cultural Centre in Brantford, Ontario, has the central image Beam favoured in New Mexico, though now one that represents his current situation. Here a shaman figure holds the hands of a figure to either side, likely a veiled reference to his wife, Ann, and his daughter, Anongonse, born in 1980.\\"Joan Murray, The What of Our Being catalogue, 2002, p.5 The family moved to Peterborough, Ontario, and in 1984, Beam was commissioned to make an art work for the Thunder Bay Art Gallery. He titled the piece Exorcism. This became part of a \\"breakthrough exhibition\\" for him, which had a catalogue, and was titled Altered Egos the Multi-media Artwork of Carl Beam. It was curated by Elizabeth McLuhan. Living in the east end of Peterborough, Ontario, Beam created an early set of large format etchings, consisting of nine prints. There are many signature images in this print collection, which Beam later used to form the image backbone of his iconic work The North American Iceberg. This work was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada, making Beam the first artist of Native ancestry to have his work purchased into the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Canada as contemporary art. Mature style By the mid-1980s, Beam was working with new techniques for incorporating photo-imagery into his work. He utilized a heat transfer technique learned from fellow artist Ann Beam, with his work on paper and Plexiglas. He also began working with photo emulsion and mixed media on paper and large-scale canvas works. The works contained various juxtapositions of imagery from the spiritual, the natural, and political world, and incorporated his own poetic inscriptions and math equations. \\"My works are like little puzzles, interesting little games. I play a game of dreaming ourselves as each other. In this we find out that we're all basically human.... My work is not fabricated for the art market. There's no market for intellectual puzzles or works of spiritual emancipation\\"Carl Beam in conversation with the author. In Allan J. Ryan, The Trickster Shift: Humour and Irony in Contemporary Native Art, Vancouver and Seattle, UBC Press and University of Washington Press, 1999, p. 151. The Columbus Project The subject matter of his work turned toward the rapidly approaching 500th anniversary in 1992 of Christopher Columbus, and his arrival in North America. He found in this event, a rich source for a discussion on the nature of culture, as well as revisions and versions of history. He created at this time (1989–1992) a body of work entitled The Columbus Project. Its first stage had exhibition venues in Peterborough, Ontario at both ArtSpace (curated by Shelagh Young), and also the Art Gallery of Peterborough. The second phase of the Columbus Project was an exhibition at The Power Plant in Toronto, curated by Richard Rhodes entitled the Columbus Boat. The exhibition continued on to venues in Italy and the United States. Beam's imagery for the Columbus Project was cross- culturally vast, and contained the primary images of Columbus, and Native peoples, but also images of Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy, Albert Einstein, and Abraham Lincoln, Italian Christian iconography, diverse animal species, self-portraits and technology (stop lights, rockets). There were two sculptural elements, Voyage a partial reconstruction of the Santa Maria, and the Ampulleta, a hourglass, with one obstructive stone within the sand, as well as several installations, and a video performance of Beam in the Dominican Republic, making a representational graveyard on the beaches where the landing could have taken place. In 1992 Carl Beam and Ann Beam built an adobe house on Manitoulin Island. \\"Their adobe house became to a certain extent, a large-scale project which evolved naturally out of their earlier experiences with Native American pottery and the building vernacular of the American southwest.\\"Virginia Eichorn, It's All Relative Catalog, 2005, p.6Their life experience was incorporated in his exhibition Living in Mother Earth, and her exhibition Sub-division Suite/Earth Builder's Narrative. The Whale of Our Being Beam entered the new millennium with the body of work entitled The Whale of Our Being, in this work \\"Beam examines the calamitous moral fallout from what he perceives as a profound spiritual absence in contemporary society, symbolized by a great whale of primordial proportions\\".Allan J. Ryan, 2005 Governor General's Awards for Excellence in Visual and Media Arts Catalog, p.18,21, Featuring large photo emulsion works on canvas, constructions, large-scale paper works, and ceramics. \\"Compared to earlier work, The Whale of Our Being exhibits a positively baroque complexity, a dizzying assortment of references, sometimes printed in overly saturated, fluorescent colour. Mystery, for instance, is pink-Day-Glo-coloured pink. The colour in Summa ranges from Day-Glo yellow-green to orange; the images from Einstein and the Hubble Telescope, and astronaut, and Sitting Bull to and image of the First Nations, and more besides.\\"Joan Murray, The Whale of Our Being catalogue, 2002, p.3 His imagery had become vast and all inclusive, in The Whale of Our Being \\"He re-examines the media construction of violence and infamy and the public fascination with celebrity\\".Allan J. Ryan, 2005 Governor General's Awards for Excellence in Visual and Media Arts Catalog, p.21 Said Beam at a panel discussion for the Beyond History exhibition in 1989, \\"If an artist has a legitimate premise, there is nothing which isn't within their field of enquiry\\".Carl Beam, panel discussion, Beyond History exhibition, Vancouver, 1989 Crossroads His last body of work was in process until the time of his death in 2005. It was titled Crossroads from the blues song by Robert Johnson. The work included images of pop stars, gangsters, scientists, native leaders, politicians, writers and poets, musicians (Robert Johnson, Bob Dylan, Marilyn Manson, Jerry Garcia, Britney Spears, John Lennon), TV personalities (Martha Stewart), animals, and birds. He had completed Plexiglas works, and 22\\"x 30\\" paper works for Crossroads and was in the middle of a suite of etchings at the time of his death. It's All Relative exhibition In 2004, the Canadian Clay and Glass Gallery in Waterloo, Ontario, created a traveling exhibition, curated by Virginia Eichhorn, of 50 ceramic pieces by Carl Beam, Ann Beam, and Anong Migwans Beam. This marked the first time all three exhibited together. It was his last exhibition during his lifetime. It continues to tour. Legacy Carl Beam was the first artist of Native ancestry to have his work purchased by the National Gallery of Canada as contemporary art (1986), thus opening the door for a generation of Native artists to enter. \\"Despite Beam's reluctance to be defined as a \\"Native Artist\\", his art deals with the struggles of his people.\\"Dierdre Hanna, NOW magazine, Vol.9, #26, 1990 Beam brought an innovative approach to all the media he worked in. \\"Technically Beam is regarded as an innovator for his intentional blurring of diverse art practises, thereby enabling certain methodologies and techniques to acquire new contexts. His innovative techniques, in fact, have been emulated by a new generation of artists-Native and not.\\"Virginia Eichorn, It's All Relative Catalog, 2005, p.5 \\"He evolved his own unique techniques as needed in photo-etching and photo based painting, to name a few, and his passionate discourse on all things political and practical inspired many people.\\"Ann Beam in discussion with Anong Beam, Manitoulin Island, 2008 A major retrospective of his work, mounted by the National Gallery of Canada, was placed on exhibition starting October 22, 2010, thus recognizing Beam as one of Canada's most important artists. The exhibition, curated by Greg A. Hill, Audain Curator and Head of the Department of Indigenous Art,was accompanied by a catalogue with essays by Ann Beam, Greg Hill, Gerald McMaster, Virginia Eichhorn, and Alan Corbiere with Crystal Migwans, including paintings, photo-based collage works, constructions, ceramics and videos.Newsletter: On TOUR National Gallery of Canada and Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography Travelling Exhibitions Newsletter No. 16 - June 2008 On May 24, 2020the 77th anniversary of his birthdaythe Art Canada Institute posted that it will be publishing a book on Beam, written by his daughter, Anong Beam.

She was captured by the Royal Navy in 1759 and became the fifth-rate HMS Arethusa. She remained in Royal Navy service for twenty years until she was wrecked after being badly damaged in battle. French service The ship was constructed at Le Havre for privateer warfare as Pélerine. Soon after her launch, she was purchased by the King and commissioned as Aréthuse on 21 January 1758. In June, under captain Vauquelin, she sailed through the British blockade of Louisbourg. She helped defend the site before departing, again forcing the blockade. On 18 May 1759, she was in transit from Rochefort to Brest, under the command of Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis of Vaudreuil, when she was intercepted near Audierne Bay (Baie d'Audierne) by three Royal Navy ships – , and . She attempted to escape but after two hours, she lost her topmasts and was overtaken by her pursuers. Thames and Venus engaged her with heavy fire, causing 60 casualties before she surrendered. Royal Navy service She entered service with the Royal Navy. For the rest of the war, she was in service in British home waters and was responsible for the capture of several French privateer cutters. In 1777, a Scotsman James Aitken, widely known as John the Painter, was hanged from her mizzenmast for burning the Rope House at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard on 7 December 1776, to aid the cause of American independence . The mast was struck from the ship and re-erected at the dockyard entrance so as many people as possible could watch the execution. This was the only execution for arson in royal dockyards. On 17 June 1778, she fought a famous duel against the French 36-gun frigate, . Belle Poule was on a reconnaissance mission, along with the 26-gun , the corvette and the smaller Coureur when she encountered a large British squadron that included Arethusa at a point south of The Lizard. Admiral Keppel, commanding the British fleet ordered that the French ships be pursued.Syrett (1998), p.36 The captain of Belle Poule refused the order to sail back to the British fleet. The British fired a warning shot across his ship's bow, to which he responded with a full broadside. This began a furious, two-hour battle between the two ships that resulted in the deaths of the French second captain and 30 of the crew. However, Arethusa was crippled by the loss of a mast and withdrew, allowing Belle Poule to escape.Syrett (1998), p.38 This battle was the first between British and French naval forces during the American Revolutionary War and took place around three weeks before the formal declaration of war by France. The battle was widely celebrated in France as a victory, even inspiring a hair- style in court circles that included a model of Belle Poule. It was also viewed as a victory in Britain and became the subject of a traditional Sea shanty, The Saucy Arethusa (Roud # 12675). Arethusa is also the subject of a song on the Decemberists' album Her Majesty the Decemberists. On 18 March 1779, under captain Charles Holmes Everitt, Arethusa engaged the French Aigrette, under Lieutenant Mortemart, sustaining considerable damage in the fight. Arethusa was wrecked the next day off Ushant, at a point . It was apparently the fame of this Arethusa which induced the Royal Navy, during the following two centuries, to bestow the name on a further seven consecutive individual ships (see ) and two consecutive classes of cruisers (see Arethusa- class cruiser).

He has published several books and essay collections on topics in British and European literatures. He is a leading Rebecca West scholar and has edited or co-edited a number of Rebecca West’s previously unpublished and uncollected works. In 2003, he founded the International Rebecca West Society in New York and was the second president of the Society. In 2013, Schweizer founded another scholarly organization, the International Society for Heresy Studies, whose vice-president he currently is. Heresy studies is designed to provide an intellectual platform for philosophers, literary critics, theologians, historians, and artists who are interested in the dialectic between heterodoxy and orthodoxy, and who want to explore dissenting and heretical ideas outside of both confessional and anti- religious frameworks. Schweizer is a proponent of sympathetic approaches to heterodox, rebellious, and challenging ideas expressed in literature and culture, and his most influential book to date, an interdisciplinary work titled Hating God: The Untold Story of Misotheism is devoted to humanists who believe in God yet deny that he is benevolent. Schweizer's most recent book, Christianity and the Triumph of Humor: From Dante to David Javerbaum traces the development of Christian religious comedy through the ages to show that humor was able to conquer all conceivable Christian taboos while delivering significant artistic and intellectual benefits. Using history, literary criticism, theology, philosophy, and social science, Schweizer demonstrates that what begun with grotesque scenes in Dante's hell ended with unfettered comical irreverence in the work of David Javerbaum. Schweizer is a naturalized American citizen, born in Switzerland. His education included elementary schooling at the Waldorf School in Biel, Switzerland, an apprenticeship in health care, autodidactic study for the federal Swiss baccalaureate, backpacking around the world, two years of college study at the University of Lausanne, a B.A. in English earned at the University of Minnesota (Twin Cities Campus), and a Ph.D. in English literature from Duke University in 1997.

It honors the contributions of the slain leaders Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. The memorial, which features King and Kennedy reaching out to each other, was designed and executed by Indiana artist Greg Perry. The bronze portraits were created by Indianapolis sculptor Daniel Edwards. On April 4, 2018, the memorial was designated as the Kennedy-King National Commemorative Site. Background On April 4, 1968, Robert Kennedy flew to Indianapolis for a planned inner-city rally promoting his presidential campaign, and was informed upon landing about King's assassination. Kennedy was told that riots had broken out in other cities and was advised not to make the speech, but he proceeded to address the gathered crowd at 17th and Broadway, near the site where the memorial now stands. Instead of a campaign stump speech, he delivered a five-minute improvised statement informing the crowd of King's death and urging racial reconciliation.\\"Symbol of peace unveiled\\", South Bend Tribune, October 1, 1995. No riots took place in Indianapolis, a fact many attribute to the effect of Kennedy's speech.Glory-June Greiff, Remembrance, Faith, and Fancy: Outdoor Public Sculpture in Indiana (Indianapolis: Indiana Historical Society Press, 2005), 28.  History  The idea to create the Landmark for Peace was originally suggested by Indiana Democratic politico Larry Conrad. Before his death Conrad befriended Steve Mannheimer, an Indianapolis Star art critic and Herron School of Art professor. They once spoke at length about the need to commemorate the events of April 4, 1968, and Robert Kennedy's speech to a crowd gathered near the corner of 17th and Broadway streets in Indianapolis. At the time Conrad was an executive with the Simon Property Group, the Indianapolis-based shopping mall developers, and a close friend of Herb Simon and his wife Diane, who had been a worker in RFK's campaign at the time of his speech. Conrad suggested that should a memorial be created, the Simon family would offer its support. In 1994 Donnie Walsh, president and CEO of the Indiana Pacers, owned by the Simon brothers, decided to start the Pacers Foundation to support worthy community initiatives. Walsh discussed his plans with Mannheimer, who recounted to Walsh the earlier conversation with Conrad. Walsh immediately seized on the idea of a memorial as an ideal project to launch the Foundation and asked Mannheimer to work with Pacers executive Kathryn Jordan on the project. Together Mannheimer and Jordan developed a plan to hold a national design competition to create a memorial to Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. The Pacers and the Pacers Foundation led community fundraising efforts for the project; beginning with Diane Simon donating $30,000 to the project. Jurors for the competition included Bret Waller, director of the Indianapolis Museum of Art, and Harry Robinson, professor of architecture at Howard University. From a national field of over 50 entries, the jury selected the proposal by designer Greg Perry, a 33-year- old artist from Franklin, Indiana.Diane Penner, The Indianapolis Star, January 15, 1995. Perry's design featured two half-figures—one of King, the other of Kennedy—emerging from solid walls flanking a pathway to reach toward each other. It was an inspired design that captured the historical importance of these two great Americans and powerfully expressed the spirit of reconciliation and the striving for peace people still found in the story of their lives—and deaths. Before the actual construction of the memorial began, a ceremonial groundbreaking was held on May 14, 1994. This event attracted President Bill Clinton, Senator Ted Kennedy, RFK's widow Ethel Kennedy, two sons of King, Dexter Scott King and Martin Luther King III, as well as other Indiana and national dignitaries. As the memorial construction got underway, the jury suggested modifications to make Perry's original design more open and inviting. These included shortening and some physical piercing of the walls to allow greater visual penetration of the entire structure. Perry worked with Mannheimer and Daniel Edwards, who sculpted and oversaw casting of the figures of King and Kennedy, to fine-tune the design. To relieve the monolithic solidity of the steel walls, the three conceived the idea of openings contoured to suggest shadows cast by the half-figures. After several attempts to shine bright lights on the half-figures to create actual shadows, Mannheimer drew the desired contours in chalk on the steel walls, which were laser cut and smoothed to create the cut-outs. The total cost of creating and installing the memorial, including two markers with bronze plaques, approached $200,000. One of the plaques contains the text of Kennedy's speech, parts of which were later inscribed on his own memorial at Arlington National Cemetery after the senator's assassination later that year. A marker near the actual spot from which Kennedy spoke contains remnants of guns confiscated by the Indianapolis police or collected as part of a city amnesty program created in conjunction with the Indiana Pacers. The contest required the confiscated weapons to be used in the memorial's design.Mary Beth Schnieder, \\"President Clinton's visit commemorates the night blacks, whites come together to rise above the potential violence\\", The Indianapolis Star, May 14, 1994. The City of Indianapolis contributed significantly to the project by completely redesigning the southern half of King Memorial Park where the sculpture would stand. This effort amounted to a $350,000 addition to the total project and was overseen by the Indianapolis Parks and Recreation Department and its landscape architecture staff. The unveiling of the Landmark for Peace memorial on September 30, 1995, attracted nearly 3,000 people.Marcella Fleming, \\"'It Refreshes My Soul'\\", The Indianapolis Star, October 1, 1995. On April 4, 2018, exactly fifty years after King's assassination and Kennedy's speech, President Donald Trump signed into law the Kennedy-King National Commemorative Site Act designating the Landmark for Peace Memorial as the Kennedy-King National Commemorative Site.  Expansion  In April 2009, a $3 million expansion was planned for the memorial. Components of this expansion would include an eternal flame incorporated into the site, an amphitheater to seat 75 to 200 people, and twin elliptical walkways along a wall that abruptly end to symbolize the sudden end of the lives of King and Kennedy.Diana Penner, \\"Building on a Dream\\", The Indianapolis Star, March 30, 2009.

If society is intrinsically informational, and the analyst is inescapably part of the society, so too must the analyst and the analysis be informational, as tied up with and characterized by the nature of information as every other social entity or phenomenon. As Lash repeatedly insists, “The critique of information is in the information itself” (p. 220); “Information critique must be critique without transcendentals” (p. 9). Andersen (2005/2008) equates information criticism with the criticism of the functionality and legitimacy of knowledge organization systems such as bibliographies, classification systems, thesauri, encyclopedias and search engines — all systems that in some way or another mediate the recorded part of society and culture. Such knowledge organization systems are also the professional tools of librarians. Literature * Andersen, Jack (2008). Information Criticism: Where is it? In: Questioning Library Neutrality.

It was released as the second single from the album, reaching number nine on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Like the first single from the album, \\"Brilliant Disguise\\", \\"Tunnel of Love\\" reached number one on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and reached the top twenty in Canada peaking at number seventeen. The music video received five MTV Video Music Awards nominations, including Video of the Year and Best Male Video. History Like much of the Tunnel of Love album, \\"Tunnel of Love\\" was recorded in Springsteen's home studio, called Thrill Hill East, between January and May 1987 with several members of the E Street Band. On this song, Springsteen played several instruments and is backed by Roy Bittan on synthesizers, Nils Lofgren on lead guitar and Max Weinberg on drums. Springsteen's future wife, Patti Scialfa, provided backing vocals. Effects on the song include the sounds of a family riding a roller coaster in Point Pleasant, New Jersey. The song uses a fairground funhouse ride as a metaphor for marriage. The relationship described in the song has three principals - the singer, his wife, and all the things they are scared of. The singer feels that marriage should be simple (\\"man meets woman and they fall in love\\"), but recognizes that along the way the ride can become difficult and unpredictable. The characters in the song laugh when they see each other in the funhouse mirrors, but it is not clear if they are laughing out of humor, or laughing at each other in derision. The song notes that it is all too easy for two people to lose each other on the \\"funhouse ride\\" of marriage. The music of the song echoes the lyrics. The music is complex and has half of the E Street Band playing on the song. Lofgren's surging guitar sound has been likened to the sound of the bickering couple, and the percussion and synthesizer add to the carnival atmosphere. The chanted vocal bridge at 3:40 in the song borrows the melody from the bridge of the Moody Blues' song \\"New Horizons\\" (from their 1972 album Seventh Sojourn). The song was later released on the compilation album The Essential Bruce Springsteen. The aggregation of critics' lists at acclaimedmusic.net did not place this song in its list of the top 3000 songs of all time, but rated it as one of the 1980 songs \\"bubbling under\\" the top 3000. The song has also been listed as the #20 Best Rock and Roll single of all time by Jimmy Guterman in 1992 and as one of the 7500 most important songs from 1944 through 2000 by Bruce Pollock. It was also ranked as the #10 single of 1987 by the Village Voice and the Single of the Year in 1987 by Rolling Stone. Music video Like several other videos from the Tunnel of Love album, including \\"Brilliant Disguise\\", \\"One Step Up\\" and \\"Tougher Than the Rest\\", the video for \\"Tunnel of Love\\" was directed by Meiert Avis. The video narrative reflects the fun house described in the song. The video was later released on the VHS and DVD Video Anthology / 1978-88. Live performance history Despite the personal nature of the song, it has occasionally been performed live. Between the Tunnel of Love Express Tour that supported the initial release of the album through July 2005, the song received 71 live performances in concert. It received renewed attention on the 2007–2008 Magic Tour as a showcase for Patti Scialfa's singing and Nils Lofgren's guitar work.

Geography Logan Village is a low density semi-rural suburb. The area has remained remote with few commercial or retail outlets. The Logan River passes through the middle of the suburb as does the disused Beaudesert railway line from Bethania to Beaudesert and the Waterford-Tamborine Road. The name derives from the river which was named by Ralph Darling, the Governor of New South Wales, after Captain Patrick Logan. The township was referred to by various names in the colonial era, including Village of Logan, Town of Logan, and Logan Town. History In 1827 Captain Patrick Logan, commandant of the Moreton Bay penal colony, made an expedition to Mount Barney. The expedition is believed to have camped beside the Logan River near present-day Logan Village; Logan notes in his journal, \\"June 19th.—…at two o’clock arrived at the Logan, not fordable; stopped for the night;\\". On the first accurate map of the region compiled by the surveyor Robert Dixon and published in 1842 (This map of Moreton Bay), the Logan River is shown with a navigation limit marked near the locality of Logan Village. The label \\"Boats to here\\" is placed at up river from the site now occupied by the township. The area was initially subject to settlement restrictions. Until 1842 a exclusion radius for the penal colony prohibited free settlers. Apart from escaped convicts it was timber, especially cedar, that brought the first European activity to the Albert and Logan catchments. After 1842, with closure of the penal colony, land north of Beaudesert towards Brisbane was opened for leasehold only, to facilitate planning and cropping; unlike further south in the Upper Logan where squatters occupied large runs or stations. Freehold settlement European settlement at Logan Village itself originated in its location as the head of navigation on the Logan River, and with the Logan Agricultural Reserve being proclaimed in 1862 for freehold selection. The first constructions were a wharf and store for the cotton plantation at ‘Townsvale’ (Veresdale) owned by Robert Towns. Town of Logan, Logan Village, 19th centuryThe locality became part of the Agricultural Reserve when it was extended the following year in 1863 by a further . The 1863 plan of extension for the Reserve shows the proposed township as portion no. 184, designated RES (reserve), along the east side of the Logan River with an area of . The township was surveyed in 1865, with town lots of around . The first recorded burial in the Logan Village cemetery occurred on 30 October 1878. However, it was not until 1 February 1879 that the reserve for the cemetery was gazetted and the trustees were appointed on 14 March 1879. On 2 September 1976, the Beaudesert Shire Council took over control of the cemetery. A lawn graves section was established on 15 April 1981. The Village of Logan Provisional School opened on 1 March 1872, becoming the Logan Village State School in February 1901. The Beaudesert railway line opened from Bethania to Logan Village on 21 September 1885. Its extension to Beaudesert was completed on 16 May 1888. The town was served by Logan Village railway station (). The first bridge built at Logan Village over the Logan River opened in 1897. Swept away by flood in 1903, it was 93 years before it was replaced with a new bridge in 1996 which was named after the Beaudesert Shire Engineer, Geoff Philp. A railway from Logan Village to Canungra was first proposed in 1900 with a survey commissioned in 1908. In 1911 the Queensland Government decided to construct the Canungra railway line from Logan Village railway station on the Beaudesert railway line to Canungra. Construction began in 1913 and the line opened to Canungra on 2 July 1915.\\"The Canungra Branch\\" Australian Railway History January 1993 pp12-19 In the 1920s, Rifle Range no. 98 was located along Miller Road for the Logan Village Rifle Club. World War 2 During the Second World War Camp Cable, an army training base, extended from Logan Village in the north to the Albert River in the south-east. Memorials relating to the camp were relocated from its former entrance to the grounds of the Logan Village RSL in 2012. Local council amalgamations Formerly in the Shire of Beaudesert, Logan Village became part of Logan City following the local government amalgamations in March 2008.

Across Cesar Chavez Avenue from Union Station, the Mission Revival and Spanish Colonial Revival building of Terminal Annex, which was designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Construction and opening Terminal Annex in 2008 Designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood, the Terminal Annex was built by the Sarver & Zoss contracting firm from 1939 to 1940. The building was built for the purpose of processing all incoming and outgoing mail in Los Angeles. Though its purpose was principally utilitarian, Underwood sought to keep the building's design in keeping with the city's Union Station, which opened across the street in May 1939. The original building was a three-story structure with two towers and of floor space. The $3 million postal annex opened in May 1940 with 1,632 postal clerks, carriers and laborers responsible for the processing of 2 million pieces of mail per day. The facility, which was kept open 24 hours a day, was equipped with the latest facilities for rapid handling of mail, including conveyors, chutes, weighing machines, cancelling machines, and sorting and facing tables. At the time of its opening, it was considered \\"the most modern and efficient\\" post office in the nation. At the formal dedication ceremony in June 1940, the postmaster called the annex a symbol of the achievements of democracy, opening at a time when the monuments of Europe were \\"being ground in the dust.\\" Expansion to meet increased volume Only ten years after its opening, the demands of the city's mail had already outgrown the facility. Accordingly, the Post Office announced plans in 1950 for a $12 million expansion, including an adjoining five-story parcel post building and other structures as well. Scandals and tragedies During nearly 50 years as the city's central postal processing facility, the Terminal Annex suffered a number of scandals and tragedies, including the following: *In 1954, two veteran postal employees were charged with being the ringleaders of two large bookmaking operations operating out of the Terminal Annex. Investigators alleged that 10-15 other employees were involved in the operations. *In 1970, a postal supervisor was shot and killed at the Terminal Annex by a disgruntled postal clerk. After the supervisor ordered the clerk to leave work for intoxication, the clerk waited outside the annex and shot the supervisor in the back three times as the supervisor ran toward the security desk, calling for help. *In 1978, a pipe bomb, wrapped in a package, exploded in a sorting room at the Terminal Annex, slightly injuring six postal workers. *In 1985, a malfunctioning voltage line in the basement of the Terminal Annex caused an 8-1/2 hour power blackout that halted operations at the facility. The power outage resulted in a one-day delay in the delivery of 1.5 million pieces of mail and was front-page news in the Los Angeles Times. *In 1986, 12 postal workers employed at the Terminal Annex were charged as alleged pushers of both powder and rock cocaine. Insufficient space leads to construction of South Los Angeles facility By the 1980s, the operations had outgrown even the expanded facilities at the Terminal Annex. The facility's volume had grown by the mid-1980s to 14 million pieces of mail per day, and the annex was plagued by inadequate space, overcrowding and inadequate work areas. Accordingly, the Postal Service Board of Governors in 1984 approved the construction of a new $151 million general post office in South Los Angeles. Almost 50 years after Terminal Annex became the city's main mail-processing facility, the new processing facility in South Central opened in 1989. The site is currently used as a data center. As of December 2015 the lobby level houses a postal counter with stamp sales and provides mail pick-up for customers who rent mail boxes. Filming locations When the Postal Service moved out of the building in 1995, it was used as a film location for the motion picture Dear God in 1995 and for the CBS television series EZ Streets in 1996. Producers used the lobby, decorated with WPA murals, to represent City Hall. It was also turned into a hospital, complete with an emergency room entrance, for the movie City of Angels. Data center Most of the building has been leased to CoreSite as their LA2 data center.http://www.coresite.com/data-centers/los-angeles/la2 Like all data centers, it is a secure facility, and not open to the public. Murals The lobby includes twelve Federal Art Project murals painted by Boris Deutsch during 1941 to 1944.

(Dopamine in the periphery only causes side effects, no antiparkinson effect.) COMT inhibitors block the second way. An aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (synonyms: DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor, Extracerebral decarboxylase inhibitor, DDCI and AAADI) is a medication of type enzyme inhibitor which inhibits the synthesis of dopamine by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC, AAAD, or DOPA decarboxylase). It is used to inhibit the decarboxylation of L-DOPA to Dopamine outside the brain, i.e. in the blood. This is primarily co-administered with L-DOPA to combat Parkinson's disease. Administration can prevent common side-effects, such as nausea and vomiting, as a result of interaction with D2 receptors in the vomiting center (or cheomoreceptor trigger zone) located outside the blood–brain barrier. Examples of extracerebral decarboxylase inhibitors include Carbidopa and Benserazide. Indications Peripherally selective DDCIs incapable of crossing the protective blood–brain barrier (BBB) are used in augmentation of L-DOPA (levodopa) in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) to block the conversion of L-DOPA into dopamine outside the brain, for the purpose of reducing adverse side effects. Combined L-DOPA and DDCI therapy does not inherently decrease peripheral cardiovascular side effects of L-DOPA administration; however, combined therapy potentiates the central effects of L-DOPA by decreasing the dose-dependency 4-5 fold, therein allowing for effective Parkinson's disease treatment without cardiovascular risk associated with high peripheral dopamine.Cotzias, G.

After graduation, he was appointed lecturer on anatomy and physiology at Bowdoin Medical College at Concord, New Hampshire, and there he undertook also the editorship of the New Hampshire Medical Journal which he conducted successfully for nine years. In 1853, on being called to the chair of physiology and pathology in the New York Medical College, Parker left Concord and established himself in practice in New York City, his confrères in the college being Peaslee and Barker. During the three years that Parker held this professorship he established the Medical Monthly (1854), which he continued to edit personally for many years with great ability and success, and was co-editor of The Journal of Medicine, Concord, in 1850. In 1854 he received the degree of A. M. from Trinity College, and in 1858, by the solicitation of many friends and patients, was induced to remove to Poughkeepsie, New York, where he practiced nearly up to the time of his death, a period of some forty years. Parker was elected president of the Medical Society of the State of New York in 1862; and held a commission in the corps of volunteer surgeons provided by the state under Governors Edwin D. Morgan and Horatio Seymour; and was also one of the medical board of Vassar Brothers Medical Center in Poughkeepsie. He died in Poughkeepsie in 1896.

It is unknown if rolled oysters were actually invented by the Mazzonis, or if the recipe was brought over from Italy with them. During prohibition, Mazzoni's remained open by selling these oysters in their new restaurant and it became a popular food item all over town.

Marking the return of the nameplate after a hiatus of less than a year, the revived Taurus is a mid-cycle revision of the Ford Five Hundred full-size sedan. After its retail withdrawal following the 2007 model year, the Crown Victoria was replaced by this generation of the Taurus, making it the flagship Ford sedan for the first time. Along with the revived Taurus, the Ford Freestyle wagon/CUV was rebranded the Taurus X. In a similar rebranding, the Mercury Montego adopted the Sable nameplate; no Mercury version of the Taurus X was marketed, nor any Lincoln version of the fifth-generation Taurus. As with the Five Hundred, the fifth-generation Taurus was sold exclusively as a sedan. For the first time, all-wheel drive was offered as an option. The fifth-generation Ford Taurus was assembled in Chicago, Illinois (Chicago Assembly) along with the Mercury Sable. The fifth-generation Taurus was marketed in North America, South Korea, Mexico, and the Middle East. Outside the United States, Canada, and South Korea, it retained the previous Ford Five Hundred branding. For the 2010 model year, the sixth-generation Taurus made its debut, which would become the final generation produced (outside of China). Design As a rebranded and modified Ford Five Hundred, the 5G Taurus featured an engine with 30% more power; a front facelift; chrome-trimmed, fender-located faux engine vents; revised tail lights; and increased sound absorption measures, including foam pellets expanded into the A-pillars and a new sound-absorptive material, marketed as Sonosorb, used throughout the body. The 5G Taurus used a new 6-speed automatic transmission (the GM-Ford 6-speed automatic transmission, jointly developed with General Motors), in contrast to the Aisin 6-speed used in the Five Hundred, and was no longer equipped with the CVT. Handling was revised by re-engineering the front end – transferring the weight of the engine from the sub-frame directly to the chassis via hydraulic mounts – increasing front suspension travel by 10mm (10%) and retuning the suspension. Exterior The Fifth-generation Taurus was an upgraded and rebranded Five Hundred. The exterior of the 5G Taurus is largely carried over from the Five Hundred, apart from a revised front fascia with a three bar grille, headlights, and fog lights; revised tail lights; roof-mounted Satellite radio antenna; and chrome-trimmed, fender-located faux engine vents. Each trim level features new wheels. Ford's chief designer Peter Horbury noted that the Five Hundred's styling had been problematic and said of the front and rear facia modifications: \\"when we did the face lift, and it became the Taurus; it didn’t set the world on fire, either. If you remodeled either end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, I’m sure you’d still know what it was.'\\" Interior As with the exterior, the interior of the 5G Taurus is largely carried over from the Five Hundred with subtle differences such as darker simulated woodgrain and new steering wheel. Ford relocated the wiper switch from the left hand side (as with the Five Hundred) to the turn signal stalk on the right hand side, as has been the design of every Taurus since its 1986 introduction. The interior featured a revised radio faceplate with chrome trim around the buttons, a new double-tiered bin in the center console, and a new shifter design. Notably the 5G Taurus features Ford's SYNC system, developed by Microsoft, which accepts voice commands and can connect the driver's cell phones and MP3 players to the car, while organizing personal information. Models and Engines The 5G Taurus was offered in SE, SEL and Limited trim levels. The SE retailed at approximately $24,000 US$, with the middle option SEL at US$26,000 and the Limited at US$30,000. This generation of Taurus uses the 263 hp 3.5 L Duratec 35 V6 which replaces the Duratec 30 3.0 L V6. The Five Hundred/Freestyle's ZF-Batavia CVT, which had a maximum torque capacity of , is also replaced with a Ford-GM joint venture six-speed automatic capable of withstanding the Duratec 35s additional torque. The Aisin AW six-speed automatic that was used on FWD Five Hundred and Montegos was also replaced by the GM-Ford 6-speed automatic transmission. Taurus nameplate The fourth- generation (4G) Ford Taurus was manufactured concurrently with a larger, new front-wheel drive sedan, the Ford Five Hundred and was discontinued in late 2006 for model year 2007. After discontinuation of the 4G Taurus, the Five Hundred, which did not perform to expectations, was rebranded as the 5G Taurus. Autoblog and The Truth About Cars expressed disappointment that Ford let the Taurus nameplate decline. MSNBC interviewed many Ford workers who felt that Ford unjustly abandoned the car that had done so much to revitalize Ford and the US industry. In an October 25, 2006 USA Today editorial, \\"How Ford starved its Taurus\\", it was noted that while the Japanese stick with their popular models and keep them up to date and competitive, (such as the Toyota Corolla, which has been in continuous production since the 1960s), the Detroit automakers regularly abandon established models in search of \\"the next big thing\\". After taking position as CEO at Ford Alan Mulally said in an interview with the Associated Press that he was baffled the Taurus had been discontinued, saying he believed discontinuing the Taurus was a mistake, and that the Five Hundred should have been named \\"Taurus\\" from the beginning. In mid 2007, revamped versions of the Five Hundred and Freestyle were unveiled as \\"Taurus\\" and \\"Taurus X\\" at the 2007 Chicago Auto Show. In a later interview, Mulally said the Taurus name was well known and had positive brand equity, something that would take time and money to give to the Five Hundred. Variants=Mercury Sable 2008 Mercury Sable For the 2008 model year, the Mercury Montego received the same mid-cycle update as the Ford Five Hundred; in line with the revival of the Ford Taurus, the Montego was renamed the Mercury Sable. Receiving the same 3.5L V6 and 6-speed automatic as the Taurus, cosmetic updates to the Sable were more extensive, with a redesigned front and rear fascias, larger grille, and clear-lens taillamps. The redesigned interior adopted several changes, including two-tone leather seating, with hydrographically printed woodgrain in multiple color patterns. As part of the closure of the Mercury brand, the Sable ended production after the 2009 model year; no Mercury Sable counterpart of the sixth-generation Taurus entered development. Ford Taurus X 2008 Ford Taurus X SEL Alongside the mid-cycle update to the Ford Five Hundred/Mercury Montego, for 2008, the Ford Freestyle crossover SUV received a similar update, adopting the Ford Taurus X nameplate. Sharing the powertrain of the Taurus/Sable, the Taurus X adopted a revised front fascia, similar to the Taurus sedan. In line with larger Ford SUVs, the Taurus X offered an outdoors-themed Eddie Bauer edition for the first time. Following lower than expected sales, the Taurus X ended production on February 27, 2009; while not an official replacement, the Ford Flex is also a crossover SUV based upon the D3-platform Ford Taurus.

Emmanuel Cole's efforts forced the British to provide improved conditions of service to Sierra Leonean soldiers of the Royal West African Frontier Force and for other RWAFF soldiers throughout British West Africa. Early life Emmanuel Cole was born in 1908 in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone to poor Creole parents. After he graduated from secondary school in 1926, he immediately joint the Royal West African Frontier Force at the age of eighteen. He was attached to the Royal Artillery at the heavy battery in Murray Town Barracks in Freetown. Protest In January 1939, Cole convinced a group of his fellow Sierra Leonean soldiers to join him in sending a letter of protest to their British commanding officer, complaining that their pay was not enough to meet expenses. Cole and his fellow soldiers also demanded to be treated in the same way as British soldiers of the same rank and most of all they demanded boot and other forms of footwear. The British Inspector-General of the West African Frontier Force had recommended boots for the soldiers as early as 1903, but the British officers on the sport preferred the African soldiers to remain barefoot to suggest their inferiority to British troops. When the commanding officer ridiculed the soldiers' demands, Cole asked bluntly: \\"Is our flesh different from that of the white gunners?,\\" and when their demands received no consideration, Cole organised a strike. They refused to dress properly or to come to parade until given a fair treatment. The British decided to deal with Cole and the others in the harshest possible way, and they charged them with mutiny, a crime carrying severe punishment under the military code. Throughout the court martial proceedings, Emmanuel Cole was coolly defiant. The British officers sentenced Emmanuel Cole to fifteen years in prison and his fellow soldiers to period ranging down to eighty-four days, but Labour MPs in Britain agitated until Cole and the others were pardoned. Soon after the mutiny, the British were finally forced to provide boots and improved conditions of service to Sierra Leonean soldiers and other soldiers throughout British West Africa. Emmanuel Cole's efforts had brought increased dignity to thousands of his fellow West Africans.

It is part of a set of seven stamps showing places of interest and landmarks in the Philippines, at that time a United States territory. It is a postage stamp design error printed in the United States and intended to display an image of Pagsanjan Falls, a tourist attraction in Laguna province in the Philippines. However, the image on the stamp is actually of Vernal Fall in Yosemite National Park, California. The error has made the stamp the most sought after in the set: the 2008 Scott catalogue value for a very fine mint never-hinged copy of the stamp (Scott #357) is US$25.00, while no other stamp in the set exceeds US$1.00. The rest of the set comprises 2¢ – Mount Mayon, 4¢ – the Manila Central Post Office, 12¢ – Pier No. 7, Manila, 20¢ – planting rice, 24¢ – rice terraces and 32¢ – Baguio zigzag. Description The postage stamp design is of an upright rectangular form, a shape chosen so that the waterfall could be displayed in its entirety, and is printed in yellow and orange inks. The textural elements are at the top and bottom of the stamp; the base panel reads \\"United States of America\\" with 18 centavos denomination corner box on either side. Above this is a small banner that reads \\"Pagsanjan Falls\\" while a panel at the top of the stamp are the words \\"Philippine Islands\\" in an arc. The picture illustrates a large waterfall with trees growing at the top and a few boats nearby. The colors are bright so as to render the picture highly visible. Additional design elements frame the image on both sides. Error Vernal Fall Although the inscription reads Pagsanjan Falls, the waterfall on the stamp is Vernal Fall, a waterfall in Yosemite National Park in California. The error came about because the engraver, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, used a photograph of Vernal Fall as the basis for the image on the stamp because the wrong image had been supplied by the post office in Manila. At the time, July 1941, it was estimated that one and a half million copies had been printed even though a recall was considered. No stamp was issued with a corrected image.

Career Foamansa Matturi was born in 1855 in the village of Jaima in Kono District in the Eastern Province of British Sierra Leone to parents from the Kono tribe. His father was a prominent village elder in Jaima and his mother was a local Kono trader. As a young boy, Matturi quickly rose as the most dominant warrior of Jaima village. For years, the region of Kono was unstable because of frequent attacks by its neighbours. Many of the people living in Jaiama were forced to flee in the wake of such raids, and hide in caves in the Nimini hills before migrating secretly northwards towards Kuranko country. Jaiama then was one of the regions controlled by the great Mende ruler, Nyagua. When Ndawa, a professional warrior, attacked the territories of Nyagua's father in the Upper Mende region, Nyagua called for assistance from the Kono people. Matturi, the leader of the Kono responded swiftly by mobilising his Kono warriors on behalf of Nyagua. He was put in charge of all the fighting forces, and he carried out his task effectively, returning with spoils of victory for Nyagua. Nyagua rewarded Matturi by giving him all of Southern Kono and by promising to protect the region from enemy attacks. Stability in Kono With peace and stability in the region, those who had fled returned and Matturi urged his people to re-build the town. This move towards reconstruction was abruptly interrupted when Samori Toure's Mandinka warriors attacked Kono in 1893 and occupied the villages of Tecuyama and Levuma. Matturi immediately informed Nyagua who, in turn, reported to the British Governor to Sierra Leone who was based in Freetown that his region had been invaded. However, by the time the British sent in their troops to repel the invaders, Matturi with the assistance of Nyagua had already succeeded in driving the Mandinka warriors from Kono. Paramount Chief Matturi's military success in defeating Samori Toure's warriors greatly enhanced his reputation both among his subjects and the Freetown-based Colony Government. When Sierra Leone was declared a Protectorate in 1896, Foamansa Matturi was crowned the first Paramount Chief of Kono District. During his rule, Foamansa Matturi initiated several development projects in his chiefdom, and the British authorities commended him for embarking on a road construction project linking the town of Jaiama to the other main towns in the Kono District. Foamansa Matturi died at an old age in 1936.

Resorte participated in festivals and multiple concerts for thousands of people. In September 1999, the group released their second album XL. Its release represented a new push for the band and it was then when Resorte got its first taste of real fame, receiving radio and television play and reaching the Top 10 on MTV. By then they were opening concerts for internationally known bands such as Limp Bizkit and Papa Roach. Resorte took a short break in 2001 to work on new material eventually to become Versión 3.0. Carlos \\"Charal\\" Sánchez, the band's drummer and co- founder, had already left the band to be with his family. The label Manicomio shut down operations and Resorte was forced to find another recording label. Resorte eventually signed with Warner Bros. to release its third album, Rebota (f=k x) in 2002, with the addition of a new vocalist, \\"Pato\\" Elizalde, a member of the hip hop group Control Machete. This work represented Resorte's peak in musical quality, having been recorded in two major studios in the U.S. \\"Pato\\" returned to his previous group Control Machete after record sales were not as high as expected. In May 2006, Resorte performed in the Vive Latino festival and in November in Corona Music Fest. In late 2007, Tavo participated in the song \\"Chinga los Racistas\\" of the Mexican hip-hop group Cartel de Santa and was a special guest on the third album of Argentinian rapcore band Timmy O' Tool. Cristian Machado, vocalist of Ill Niño, said: \\"One of my biggest influences are the two Resorte's vocalists, who are like the Mexican Rage Against the Machine\\". In 2009, Resorte were chosen as the opening act for Metallica shows in Mexico City at the Foro Sol and for Avenged Sevenfold in the World Magnetic Tour '09. After intermittent activity, Resorte released their new single \\"Re-conecta2\\" in September 2014, released through all major digital platforms.

Scott Fitzgerald featured in the Saturday Evening Post on August 9, 1930. The story is based on Ludlow Fowler's brother's, Powell Fowler, May 1930 Paris wedding. It is Fitzgerald's first story dealing with the stock market crash, and celebrates the end of the period when wealthy Americans colonized Paris.  Summary The story begins in Normandy, sometime around May. The main character, Mike Curly, is introduced, along with the news that his ex-girlfriend, Caroline Dandy, whom he dated for two years, is engaged and will be getting married in Paris. It explains that the two broke up because of Michael's lack of money. He was devastated and could not let go, evident by his insecurity and the fact that he carried around photographs of her. He also stayed away from other girls, that she would do the same with men. One day outside of a shop, he encounters Caroline and her fiancé, Hamilton Rutherford. Rutherford invites Michael to a string of events, including his bachelor dinner, a party and tea. As they talk, his feelings for her resurge. As they parted ways, Michael feels he will never be happy again. At his hotel, the concierge delivers a telegram, which states that his grandfather died, and that he would be inheriting a quarter of a million dollars. Because of his newly found fortune he seemingly out of nowhere inherited a sum of confidence,so he decides he will try to win Caroline back. When he attends one of the parties, he meets Hamilton's father, and as more people arrive, he feels increasingly inadequate. When he finds Caroline, he is reluctant to tell her about his inheritance. They eventually dance together, and she explains how she is over him and that he should do the same. She says she feels sorry for him, and that she needs someone like Hamilton to make all the decisions. Gathering enough nerve, Michael writes to Hamilton to confront him about his intentions and asks him to meet in the bar of a hotel. Michael arrives and overhears Hamilton talking to another man about how easy it is to control a woman, and that you cannot stand for any nonsense—adding, there are hardly any men who possess their wives anymore and that he is going to be one of them. Michael becomes outraged and questions his out of date attitude. Hamilton strikes back, saying that Michael is too soft. Eventually Hamilton says goodbye and leaves. Michael rolls up at the next party with new clothing. A woman, Marjorie Collins, shows up and demands to speak to Hamilton, threatening to cause a scene. Michael avoids the drama and goes to see Caroline at her hotel. They argue about how Hamilton treats her, and Michael eventually confesses his love for her. He tries to explain to her he has money now and that his love for her is true and how he can't survive without her. Caroline does not seem to care and she notices he has new, expensive clothes. At this point, Michael tells her about his inheritance. \\"I have the money, my grandfather left me about a quarter of a million dollars.\\" quoted from Michael. \\"How perfectly well! I can't tell you how glad i am... you were always a person who ought to have money.\\" quoted from Caroline. Hamilton returns from the party and explains that the woman who tried to blackmail him gave him a secret code to a telegram. As he opens a telegram, he discovers that all of his fortunes are gone, because he had stuck with a mistake for too long. At the point when Caroline could decide to stay with Hamilton, or leave him for a newly rich Michael, she surprisingly chooses Hamilton. Michael attends the ceremony, and he learns from an acquaintance, George Packman, that a man had offered Hamilton a substantial salaried job right before the wedding. As the reception carries on, Michael realizes that he has not thought of Caroline for hours, and that he was cured from his inability to move on. He is no longer bitter, and the story concludes with him wondering which bridesmaid he has made a date with for that night. Historical Parts The Jazz Age represented a break with tradition, due to the feeling of disconnect created by modernity. It was the \\"decade of prosperity, excess and abandon, which began after the end of World War I and ended with the 1929 stock market crash.\\"\\"F. Scott Fitzgerald Criticism.\\" http://www.enotes.com/short-story-criticism/fitzgerald-f-scott (accessed July 24, 2008). Fitzgerald was included in the Lost Generation, a group of U.S. writers who grew up during the war and created their literary reputations in the 1920s. They were \\"lost\\" because in the postwar world, the values that were passed on to them seemed irrelevant. They possessed a spiritual alienation from a country that appeared to be \\"provincial, materialistic and emotionally barren.\\"\\"Lost Generation.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica, 2008. As James L. West, Penn State Fitzgerald scholar, said, \\"He [Fitzgerald] saw with considerable accuracy, the excesses and gaudiness of American society in the modern era—but he saw the great willingness of the heart that's also deeply American.\\"Blackwell, Jon. \\"1920: Fitzgerald's Own 'Paradise'.\\" http://www.capitalcentury.com/1920.html (accessed July 26, 2008). Criticism One life event relatable to \\"The Bridal Party\\" occurred when his then-fiancée, Zelda Sayre, broke off their engagement because of Fitzgerald's poor economic status.\\"A Brief Life of Fitzgerald.\\" http://www.sc.edu/fitzgerald/biography.html (accessed July 23, 2008). After his novel This Side of Paradise was published, it provided him with almost instant success, and a week later he married Zelda. Around 1930, he was drinking \\"heavily, when Powell Fowler was married in Paris—there was a round of parties from which he never sobered up.\\"Larson, Thomas. \\"F. Scott Fitzgerald's Babylon Revisited: A Long Expostulation and Explanation.\\" http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~tdlarson/fsf/babylon/chap_1.htm (accessed July 24, 2008). Like his life at that time, The Bridal Party focuses on themes such as the Great Depression, and whether one should marry for love or money. Although this was one of the earliest examples of biographical correlations found in Fitzgerald's work, his novels This Side of Paradise, Tender is the night, and many others contain more similarities to his life—particularly the tumultuous relationship he had with his schizophrenic wife Zelda. Growing up during the Great Depression and between world wars, Fitzgerald provides a romantic and economic parallel in \\"The Bridal Party\\". Michael Curly's statement, \\"I don't want to live—I used to dream about our home, our children,\\" accurately reflects the mindset of American people during and after the stock market crash of 1929. For those who lost their homes, life savings and notions of the American dream, it was hard to find a way out of their predicament. The turning point for the protagonist in this story can be seen as the sunlit door from which his newlywed ex-girlfriend exits, \\"forward to the future.\\" \\"The Bridal Party\\" is Fitzgerald's first story that touches on the dramatic effects of such a devastating event as the stock market crash. Though other themes are evident throughout the story, such as the effects of wealth on society, and excessive parties set in the roaring twenties, the relationship between Mr. Curly and his ex, Caroline can easily be compared to the stock market crash. The news of her engagement delivers a sudden grim reality to Michael, much like the Great Depression itself. It is assumed that Michael and his ex-girlfriend had a great relationship before their separation, but the reader finds that he \\"lost her slowly, tragically, uselessly, because he had no money.\\" This must have been how stock traders on Wall Street felt as they watched the value of stocks decline and tried to sell them in a panic on Black Thursday, October 24, 1929. \\"Great Depression.\\" Encyclopædia Britannica, 2008. When he discovers that she is going to marry another, richer, man he pessimistically thought, \\"I will never be happy at all any more.\\" It is obvious that he is overreacting to horrible news and did not know what to think about the situation. Even Michael's view of Caroline's appearance as \\"strained and tired—shadows under her eyes\\" is reminiscent of Dorothea Lange's documentary photographs from the Great Depression. Her subjects, like those seen in Migrant Mother, are abandoned and desperate with little hope in their faces. Caroline later says that she feels sorry for the way they were, but she was over him, and he should move on as well. His depression was intensified by feelings of inadequacy, due to a lack of money. Seeing his ex with another man only made his misery worse. His situation is similar to that of Americans during that time because neither had experienced such widespread economic failure. As pompous and misogynistic as her fiancé was, he rightfully says, \\"your affair was founded on sorrow, it seems to me that a marriage ought to be based on hope.\\" Perhaps the same hope that people needed during the thirties to recover from the Great Depression. Luckily, Franklin D. Roosevelt's plans for a New Deal and the economic resurgence provided from World War II pulled the country out of its rut. After Michael \\"floats in an abyss of helplessness\\", he finally gains the ability to let go. A simple change in his attitude causes the \\"bitterness to melt out of him,\\" and he is finally able to move on. Though Michael is initially heartbroken, his \\"New Deal\\" is finding inner peace by realizing how happy the two are and that he would not be able to have a good future by dwelling on the negative past. While this story possesses significant ties to the stock market crash and Great Depression, it is relevant today because of the current concerns about recession.

First built in 1814, two years after the county itself was established, it is the second-oldest county courthouse still in use in the state after Fulton County's. In 1847 it was renovated extensively. At that time the Classical Revival portico and columns were added. Architect James Townsend used commercially available (although inexact) copies of the Corinthian capitals from the Monument of Lysicrates in Athens. For this and its historic importance in the county's history it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Building The courthouse is a two-story, 5-by-8-bay rectangular gable-roofed frame building, with clapboard siding on the north and south sides and horizontal planks on its west (front) facade. The pedimented gable is supported by the four Corinthian columns, behind which is the main entrance, with molded classical detail. Similar ornamentation can be found on the window lintels. The two front corners have large pilasters; the original stone plinth blocks have been replaced with concrete copies and the astragals taken down to help prevent dry rot in the columns. The stone walls of the original county jail are still visible on the south side. A two-bay east wing, added later, extends from the rear. A cupola is atop the roof. History After the New York state legislature divided Putnam County from Dutchess to its north in 1812, it required the creation of two courts. Trials were held in Carmel's Baptist meeting house until a courthouse could be built. After three months, one state legislator who had voted for Putnam County's creation, Robert Weeks, sold it a one-half acre (2,000 m²) lot in the middle of Carmel. A local builder and iron miner, General James Townsend, was hired for the job. He finished it two years later for just under $4,000, using some of his locally mined ironwork, which still remains in the jail section. It opened for court on February 15, 1815. The county grew, and by the 1840s the original courthouse could not handle its workload. Officials initially decided to build a second one in Cold Spring, at the other end of the road that became Route 301, on the Hudson River where much of the county's population was. But a deed restriction in the original land acquisition forbade the county from building its courthouse anywhere but the original land, and so the existing courthouse was renovated and expanded into today's structure. The Corinthian column capitals, popular in pattern books of the time, were likely carved in New York City and shipped to Carmel, as they were for many other buildings in the lower and mid-Hudson where similar capitals have been found. In 1855 another jail wing was built to replace the one on the northeast corner. The county sheriff began living in the building at this time, and it became a tradition for his wife to cook food for the jail inmates. Another jail wing was built in 1907. A fire in 1924 destroyed most of the upper story, but it was rebuilt to its original appearance. Repairs could do nothing about the building's age, however, and by the later 20th century some degradation was becoming apparent. The sheriffs and their wives moved out in 1966, and eleven years later the jail itself was closed. In December 1988, it was closed for repairs, ending 174 years of continuous use. The repairs took six years, longer than expected, due to many problems encountered during the process. Since it reopened in 1994, it has been home to two of the county's judges and their chambers. The old jail cells have been used mainly as storage space. A newer, more modern court facility was built behind the Putnam County Office Building and opened January 2, 2008.

As the executive of a newly independent state which helped to form Malaysia, Ningkan faced many challenges from within the state and from Sarawak's neighbour, Indonesia. Personal life and education Ningkan was born on 20 August 1920 in Betong, Sarawak which was then administered under the Second Division of Simanggang. He was a student of St Augustine's school. Kalong Ningkan was of mixed Iban and Chinese parentage and his Chinese name was Mok Teck Boon. Ningkan's grandfather, Mok Ban Seng was born in Foshan, Guangdong, China in 1870. At 6 years old, he took Ningkan to China for several years so that Ningkan could learn the culture and the way of life there. However, his grandfather died on 20 October 1963 at the grand old age of 93, a few months after Ningkan took office as chief minister. Ningkan's mother, Kuni anak Karong, died of stomach complications on 14 June 1969 at the old age of 71. Hobbies and interests Ningkan learnt the Japanese language during the Japanese Occupation in Sarawak. The Japanese song, Kuni No Hana (Flower of the Nation) was one of his favourites. He was also spotted for singing Terang Bulan in various government and family functions. Ningkan was a fan of P. Ramlee and Sgt Hassan was one of his favourite movies. Early career After he completed his education, he worked as a Rubber Fund clerk from 1938 to 1939. He resigned his job to join the Sarawak Constabulary from 1940 to 1946. He was the Police Constable in the year 1942. In 1944, he joined Service Reconnaissance Department, an underground movement based in Jesselton (now Kota Kinabalu). He became a teacher in his former school in Betong from 1947 to 1950. He then worked at a Shell Company hospital in Kuala Belait, Brunei for several years. He also took up law via correspondence from Regent Institute and Metropolitan College at St Albans, London respectively. At the hospital, he was the chairman of the Shell Dayak Club. He became the Founder and President of the Sarawak Dayak Association from 1958 to 1960. Political career He returned to Betong and established the Sarawak National Party (SNAP) on 10 April 1961 by uniting the Iban people of Saribas. Although he initially did not accept Tunku Abdul Rahman's proposal on the formation of Malaysia, he eventually became a strong supporter of the federation. Ningkan never completed his law degree because he had to focus on his political activities and his post as the first chief minister of Sarawak. He also insisted that his party should be multiracial, given his background of having a Chinese grandfather and friends of various races. In October 1962, as the secretary-general of the SNAP party, Ningkan launched the Sarawak chapter of the Alliance Party which consisted of Parti Pesaka Sarawak (PESAKA), Barisan Ra'ayat Jati Sarawak (BARJASA), Parti Negara Sarawak (PANAS) and Sarawak Chinese Association (SCA) in anticipation of the 1963 district council elections. In the election, SNAP under the Sarawak Alliance managed to get the majority of local council seats (i.e. after the support of one independent winner from Binatang by the name of Jimbat Anak Intan from Meradong Scheme B tipped the balance of the number of seats won by the Sarawak Alliance and the opposition pact of SUPP and PANAS). This crucial support plus other independents enabled the Alliance to appoint a majority of divisional, state assembly and parliamentary members. This earned Ningkan the trust to become the first Sarawak Chief Minister. Appointment as Chief Minister Stephen Kalong Ningkan was appointed as the first chief minister of Sarawak on 22 July 1963 by the then Governor, Sir Alexander Waddell. Ningkan had a strong anticommunist stand during his tenure as chief minister. He also opposed the National Language and Education policy. 1966 Sarawak constitutional crisis Stephen Kalong Ningkan tried to initiate a land reform law that allowed the natives to acquire full title of Native Customary Land. However, with the alleged backing of the federal government, the Sarawak state assemblymen started to pass a motion of no confidence against him. The then prime minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman pushed for Ningkan's resignation. On 16 June 1966, Ningkan was ousted when the state Governor showed him a letter of no confidence issued by 21 out of 42 legislators and asked Ningkan to resign as Chief Minister. Ningkan refused, saying the letters were not tantamount to a vote of no confidence in the Council Negri (now Sarawak State Legislative Assembly). He was sacked by the governor but eventually reinstated by the Borneo High Court on 7 September 1966, which saw the necessity of a formal vote of no confidence. In his judgement, Justice Harley ruled that the Governor can only dismiss the Chief Minister when both these conditions are satisfied: (a) The Chief Minister has lost the confidence of the House, and (b) The Chief Minister has refused to resign and failed to advise a dissolution. Ningkan tried to initiate a dissolution of Council Negri upon his reinstatement of chief minister to seek a fresh mandate from the voters; but the Malaysian government decided to impose a state of emergency in Sarawak, citing chaos in the state. The Malaysian government also amended the Sarawak Constitution to give the power to the Sarawak governor to commence the Council Negri meeting. A vote of non-confidence was passed on 23 September 1966, and this has resulted in the removal of Ningkan from the chief minister office for the second time.Milne, R.S. and Ratnam K.J. (2014).

Plot A young woman wanders barefoot in the lush Aokigahara (青木ヶ原), also known as the Sea of Trees (樹海 Jukai) region of Mount Fuji, and suddenly falls into a cavern, awakening in an icy cave full of large eggs. When one of the eggs start to hatch, she goes into hysterics and flees until she is discovered by a construction crew. Before falling into a coma, the girl babbles about what she saw to a reporter. Her story airs on a televised news report that is seen by geologist Takashi Ashizawa. Upon hearing about the fossilized egg, Takashi sets off to Mount Fuji to find it. When he arrives at the small village bordering Fuji's Saiko Lake, Takashi immediately heads into the heavily forested Jukai when a sudden earthquake occurs and he is knocked out. He later awakens in his father's old cabin near Saiko Lake, and discovers that he was rescued by Shohei Muku, an old friend of the family. Takashi quickly gets back to fossil-hunting and heads toward the Jukai once again. As he cruises through the nearby village, he greets two women named Akiko, a former lover of his, and Junko. Meanwhile, other bizarre things start happening around the Saiko Lake community. A young couple in a paddle boat disappear without a trace, an injured diver is pulled from the lake and livestock begin to mysteriously vanish. Takashi begins developing a theory that a dinosaur is alive and well in Saiko Lake. His theory gains credence when Junko stumbles upon a headless horse-corpse lying in the road, and Takashi later finds it lodged in a tree while taking photographs of some strange tracks in the mud. The following day, Takashi sits in his father's cabin and develops a possible theory as to what type of creature could have killed the horse and placed the remains in a tree for safekeeping. He decides that the creature must be a living Plesiosaurus and shares his minimal proof and hypothesis with a very skeptical Shohei. His theory proves correct when a Plesiosaurus really does appear and devours some local pranksters during a festival outside. The creature continues to subtly terrorize the community and devours two more women, including Junko, whose death is witnessed by Akiko and their pet dog. Takashi and Akiko soon discover the presence of another prehistoric beast, a Rhamphorhynchus, which also proceeds to menace the community. Eventually, the two prehistoric beasts come face-to-face, with the Plesiosaurus eventually gaining the upper hand against the Rhamphorhynchus, despite losing an eye. Mount Fuji then finally erupts, sending the reptiles into a fiery chasm below as the ground gives way. Akiko almost falls to her death, before Takashi is able to grab her by the hand. The film then ends, leaving the two protagonists' fates ambiguous.

After serving as head of Japanese delegations at overseas film festivals and trade fairs, he formed business relationships with executives of Western-style distribution companies. Studying the styles of Western filmmaking, he ordered a screening of Jaws at the Toei Studios. Okada determined that American film trends would gain popularity in Japan, and that Japanese filmmaking should adopt those trends. Based on the success of Jaws, he determined that similar “monster movie” films would be successful. Production began in December 1975, the same month that Jaws was released nationwide in Japan. It also coincided with a resurgence of reports of Nessie in Loch Ness. With a view to the world market, the film was to include Mt. Fuji (as a symbol of Japan) and the similar theme of a mysterious lake- dwelling monster. The script incorporated other elements of Japanese culture such as dragon legends and myths. In the spring of 1976, an early title for the screenplay was “The Giant Monster Bird vs. The Giant Dragon God\\" (大怪鳥対大竜神, Dai kaisho tai Dai ryujin).The final script was completed on September 3, 1976 with filming starting on October 12.Toei Video DVD Software \\"Legend of Dinosaurs and Birds\\" (DSTD002415) Commentary/ Kazuyoshi Otsu Interview Filming ended after six months, on March 21, 1977, between locations at Toei Studios and Mt.Fuji. Production costs totaled 東映ビデオDVDソフト『恐竜・怪鳥の伝説』（DSTD002415）解説書より (Toei Company) (),; this included ¥150 million for special effects, ¥45 million for film equipment and ¥20 million for models/animatronics. A 24-meter pool was also built for water scenes within Toei’s Kyoto Studio. Model work was supervised by actor/director Fuminori Ohashi, as his final studio work before retirement. Four different kinds of ¼ scale Plesiosaurus props were created, along with life-size heads and fins, over a four-month period. A ¼ scale model of the Rhamphorhynchus was also created, as were a life-size head and feet. Release Advertising expenses for the film reached ¥100 million. Legend of Dinosaurs & Monster Birds was released in Japan on April 29, 1977, where it made ¥240 million. The film was never released theatrically in the United States. It was released to television by King Features Entertainment in 1987 with an English-language dub, and later featured in an early episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000. Box office Upon its release in the Soviet Union in 1979, it became the 19th highest-grossing foreign film of all time at the Soviet box office, with 48.7million admissions. This was equivalent to approximately million Soviet rublesMoscow Prime Time: How the Soviet Union Built the Media Empire that Lost the Cultural Cold War, page 48, Cornell University Press, 2011 (), or adjusted for inflation. Toei president Okada stated that, despite significant pre-sales at the Milan and Tehran International Film Festivals in October–November 1976, the film was not a significant success overseas. Trivia Despite the title, there are actually no dinosaurs nor \\"monster birds\\" in the film. The Plesiosaurus is a member of Sauropterygia, a unique family of reptiles only very distantly related to dinosaurs; and Rhamphorhynchus is a pterosaur, a group that had nothing to do with birds. In fact as a fellow archosaur, the Rhamphorhynchus is closest to a dinosaur out of the two. Because the movie was the only Japanese monster film available in the Soviet Union, regularly airing on the movie channels, it obtained a cult-following in Russia.

His greatest fame came as coach of Seattle Pacific University where he led the team to five NCAA Division II championships. He was the 1978 NSCAA Coach of the Year and retired ranked second on the all time collegiate coaching wins list with 597 wins.NCAA Men’s Coaching Records McCrath grew up in Michigan as an avid hockey fan. He had originally intended to attend Michigan State to play hockey, but attendance at a revival changed his mind and he entered Wheaton College in 1954.Seattle Pacific Soccer Coach a Kick in Every Sense That year, he saw soccer played for the first time. Intrigued, he tried out for the team his sophomore year.McCrath out as coach at SPU Despite his late introduction to the game, he quickly rose to the top of the collegiate ranks when he was named an Honorable Mention (third team) All American in 1957. He graduated in the spring of 1958 and remained at Wheaton that fall to coach the team. McCrath was inducted into the Wheaton College Athletic Hall of Fame in 1979.Wheaton Hall of Fame In 1960, Gordon College in Wenham, Massachusetts hired McCrath. Over seven seasons, he took the NAIA Fighting Scots to a 52–26–2 record, four post season tournaments and the 1966 NAIA semifinals. That year, he graduated with an MDiv from the Gordon Divinity School. In 1967, he moved to Spring Arbor College where he inherited a mediocre team. In his first season, he went 4–4–0, but quickly improved as the Cougars went to the NAIA post season in 1968 and 1969. In 1969, he again took his team to the semifinals. This brought him to the attention of David McKenna, president of Seattle Pacific University, a sister school to Spring Arbor. McKenna was looking to upgrade the SPU soccer program and consequently hired McCrath. McCrath’s team again had a poor first season, going 0–7–3. However, the next year, he took the Falcons to a 7–3–4 record and the regional post-season tournament. He improved in 1972 as the Falcons made it into the NCAA post-season tournament. At the time, an investment group began laying the foundation for the establishment of a North American Soccer League franchise in Seattle, eventually to be known as the Seattle Sounders. They approached McCrath about coaching the team, but he declined. Instead, he worked with the team ownership to hire John Best as the team’s first coach. McCrath then did much of the early work scouting players and assembling a roster. Once the team began playing in 1974, he worked as a color commentator for local broadcasts of Sounders’ games.Sounders Keep Open Cup Hopes Alive Against Calgary He did not slight his collegiate coaching duties and took Seattle Pacific to the NCAA Division II championship game in 1974, 1975 and 1977. Each time, the team finished as runner-up. In 1978, the Falcons finally took the title and McCrath was named the National Coach of the Year. The Falcons won the championship again in 1983, 1985, 1986 and 1993 and finished as runner-up in 1984 and 1990. In 2007, the Falcons finished 7–6–7.

The Institute became affiliated with the K. W. Society for the Advancement of Science () in 1924. In 1928 a new building of the institute was opened at 2 Kraepelinstrasse. The building was financed primarily by a donation of $325,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation. Under the leadership of department heads Walther Spielmeyer, Ernst Rüdin, Felix Plaut, Kurt Schneider and Franz Jahnel, the Institute gained an international reputation as a leading institution for psychiatric research. Rudin, a student of Kraepelin's, took over the directorship of the Institute in 1931, while also remaining head of genetics. As well as fostering an international scientific reputation, the Institute developed close ties with the Nazi regime. Rudin (along with Eugen Fischer of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute of Anthropology, Human Heredity, and Eugenics) joined expert government committees. Rudin wrote the official commentary endorsing the forced sterilization laws. He was such an avid proponent that colleagues nicknamed him the \\"Reichsfuhrer for Sterilization\\".Science and Inhumanity: The Kaiser-Wilhelm/Max Planck Society William E. Seidelman MD, 2001 Felix Plaut (in 1935) and Kurt Neubürger were dismissed from the Institute due to their Jewish origin.

The Institute was divided into an Institute of Brain Pathology and a Clinical Institute, both at 2 Kraepelinstrasse. Twelve years later in 1966, the Institute was renamed as the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry. In the same year, a new research clinic was opened in Kraepelinstrasse 10. In 1984 the theoretical part of the Institute moved to a new building in Martinsried, west of Munich. The Departments of Neurochemistry, Neuromorphology, Neuropharmacology and Neurophysiology were moved there. The Clinical Department, the Departments of Ethology and Psychology remained in Kraepelinstrasse. The independent Research Center of Psychopathology and Psychotherapy were closed. In 1989 the Institute's building in Kraepelinstrasse was renovated and enlarged with the addition of a new laboratory wing. In 1998 the theoretical part and the clinical part of the Institute segregated. The theoretical division of the Institute became the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology and the clinical part kept the name \\"Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry\\". Research The Institute is one of the leading research centers on psychiatry. Physicians, psychologists, and natural scientists conduct research on psychiatric and on the development of diagnosis and treatment. Many patients participate in different clinical trails each year. Extensive phenotyping of the patients with analysis of blood and fluid samples, clinical psychopathology and neuropsychological testing, neurophysiological methods, neuroimaging techniques, and protein and gene analyses form the basis to investigate the causation of complex psychiatric and neurological diseases. The concept of the Institute is based on a suitable balance between clinical and laboratory research. Research groups work on topics such as stress, anxiety, Posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, psychopharmacology, sleep, and other topics. The Institute consists of a 120-bed clinic equipped with laboratories for research on sleep physiology, several special wards, a dayclinic for depression and psychiatry and various laboratories for cell and molecular biology. Medical services The Institute provides medical service for psychiatric and neurological disorders. It has a hospital, dayclinic for depression and psychiatry and several outpatient clinics. The hospital consists of four psychiatric and one neurological ward with 120 beds. It treats about 2000 inpatients per year. The Institute provides treatment for depression, anxiety disorder, sleep disorders, multiple sclerosis, Morbus Parkinson.

P.\\" Elkin CMG (27 March 1891 – 9 July 1979) was an Anglican clergyman, an influential Australian anthropologist during the mid twentieth century and a proponent of the assimilation of Indigenous Australians. Early life Elkin was born at West Maitland, New South Wales. His father, Reuben Elkin, was an English Jew and worked as a salesman; his mother, Ellen Wilhelmina Bower, was a seamstress of German ancestry. His parents were divorced in 1901, his mother died the next year and he was then brought up by his maternal grandparents as an Anglican. He went to school at Singleton and Maitland East Boys' High School. After finishing school he worked at banks in New South Wales, but then won a theological scholarship to St Paul's College, University of Sydney, where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1915.  Clerical and anthropological career  From 1916 to 1919 Elkin worked in the Anglican diocese of Newcastle and he then became a teacher at St John's Theological College, Armidale, under Ernest Henry Burgmann. Elkin became interested in Australian Aboriginal culture and although no anthropology was taught in Australia at the time, his master's thesis—which he completed successfully in 1922—was on this subject and he lectured on it at St John's. In 1922 he married Sara (Sally) Thompson, an Irish nursing sister whom he had met during an influenza epidemic. He was Anglican rector of Wollombi from 1922 and 1925 and during this period he also lectured for the University of Sydney in the Hunter Region on Aboriginal culture. In 1925, Elkin resigned from his post at Wollombi and began studying anthropology at University College, London under Grafton Elliot Smith, where he earned a PhD in 1927. In 1927 the anthropologist Alfred Radcliffe-Brown helped Elkin to gain Rockefeller funding in order to work on Australian culture in the Kimberley, Western Australia. In 1928, he was appointed as Anglican rector of Morpeth on the basis that he could continue with his anthropology. He also became co-editor of St John's Theological College's Morpeth Review. He also became editor of Oceania from its founding in 1931 until his death. He visited many missions in Western Australia, including the Mount Margaret Mission, part of the Australian Aborigines Mission (later United Aborigines Mission) in 1930 on behalf of the Australian National Research Council. p.188S Preston Walker, 'Enriching Australia through educating indigenous people', S Preston Walker, Camp Hill, QLD, Australia, 2008, , (United Aborigines Mission missionary 1940-1955). Elkin became an activist for the amelioration of Aboriginal Australians, whom he saw as best served by being assimilated into European society. In 1934 he successfully lobbied for the reprieve of Dhakiyarr (Tuckiar) Wirrpanda, a Yolngu man who had been sentenced to death for murder. Professor of anthropology Following Radcliffe-Brown's resignation from Sydney University Elkin was appointed lecturer-in-charge of the anthropology department in late 1932 and he was promoted to professor in December 1933. Until his retirement in 1956, he effectively dominated Australian anthropology, advised governments, trained administrators sent to Papua New Guinea, while also continuing his field research. He was president of the Association for the Protection of Native Races from 1933 to 1962. He was vice-president of the Aborigines Protection Board of New South Wales, (renamed Aborigines Welfare Board in 1940).Dawn, Aborigines Welfare Board of NSW After his retirement in 1966, Elkin was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1966 Birthday Honours. In 1970 he received an honorary doctorate of letters from the University of Sydney. He died at a meeting at the University, survived by his wife and two sons.

Australia subsidizes fossil fuel energy, keeping prices artificially low and raising greenhouse gas emissions due to the increased use of fossil fuels as a result of the subsidies. The Australian Energy Regulator and state agencies such as the New South Wales' Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal set and regulate electricity prices, thereby lowering production and consumer cost. According to a report by The Institute for Sustainable Futures (ISF) at University of Technology Sydney, titled: \\"Energy and Transport Subsidies in Australia\\",Energy and Transport Subsidies in Australia\\" accessdate=2008-08-04 format=pdf roughly 70% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions are caused by the energy and transport industries. The uptake of renewable energy in these sectors is slow because of subsidies to fossil fuels and the high cost of acquiring the sophisticated technology required to produce cleaner fuels. Furthermore, fossil fuels are easier to transport and use, compared to renewable energy, which often require sophisticated instruments to acquire and store. The report revealed that for the 2005–2006 financial year, transport subsidies were measured to reach up to $10.1 billion, of which 74% related to transport, 18% to electricity and 4% to renewable and efficient energy. These subsidies help energy generation companies increase their profits, therefore encouraging the building of additional coal-fuel power plants. Investing in other, more sustainable, types of electricity generation plants would have cost less than continuing to subsidize the building of these power plants.Public purse props up fossil fuel industries accessdate=2008-08-04 format=html On a positive note, alternative transport fuels such as natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas are excused from fuel excise/tax. Tax calculated for the use of a company car is calculated as such: the further the person drives the car, the higher the business use and the lower the personal use. Since tax is calculated based on personal use, drivers tend to drive longer distances to lessen the amount of tax that they have to pay. This leads to a higher consumption of vehicular fossil fuels and, subsequently, higher greenhouse gas emissions. Dr Hal Turton, the Group Leader of the Energy Economics Group at Swiss research establishment, the Paul Scherrer Institute, discussed in his report for Canberra-based think tank The Australia Institute titled: \\"The Aluminium Smelting Industry: Structure, Market Power, Subsidies and Greenhouse Gas Emissions\\",The Aluminium Smelting Industry: Structure, Market Power, Subsidies and Greenhouse Gas Emissions accessdate=2008-08-04 format=pdf that the yearly electrical use subsidy for the use of the six aluminium smelters in Australia is at least A$210 million. According to the report, Australia's aluminium smelting industry is party to one of the most subsidized electricity charges as compared to other similar establishments. The ISF report found that removing electrical subsidies would bring up electricity prices by 3.9%, which would lead to a fall in demand of electricity by 1.4% in the long run. Reducing transport subsidies would increase prices by 32%, which would lead to a fall in demand worth 18%. It suggests that subsidies should be removed gradually so as not to hurt drivers who have no choice but to use petrol (due to the lack of alternatives), and that taxpayer's funds be channeled to subsidize the sustainable energy industry instead. The National Roads and Motorists' Association (NRMA) is pushing for Australian petrol consumption to be reduced by 50% by 2050. It is advocating a move towards greener transport, and has called for a reduction of the A$10 billion subsidies given to the nation's fossil fuel industry.Fossil fuel industry's $10bn subsidy accessdate=2008-08-04 format=html Details of subsidies Coal power industries are subsidized under the Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program (GGAP).Australian Government Greenhouse Gas Abatement Program (GGAP) accessdate=2008-08-19 Jamison Report The Jamison Report was published by the NRMA in July 2008, and focused on alternative fuels and reducing emissions from motor vehicles. It was written by the Jamison Group, a team of four well-respected academics in the transport and energy fields, namely: CSIRO energy advisor David Lamb, University of New South Wales environmental science professor Mark Diesendorf, Macquarie University management professor John Mathews and Monash University Honorary Senior Research Fellow, Graeme Pearman. The report was titled: \\"A Roadmap for Alternative Fuels in Australia: Ending our Dependence on Oil\\".A Roadmap for Alternative Fuels in Australia: Ending our Dependence on Oil accessdate=2008-08-04 format=pdf The report suggests a 12-step 'roadmap' to address the issue of fossil fuel usage in motor vehicles. #Reduce oil dependence in Australia by 20 percent by 2020; 30 percent by 2030; and by 50 percent by 2050. This would complement the National Emissions Trading Scheme. #Promote and develop alternative fuels #Compulsory fuel consumption and carbon dioxide standards #Further compulsory emissions standards. This point suggests that the authorities bring emissions standards for greenhouse gases such as carbon monoxide on par to world standards in order to align the country's policies to international best practice. #Alternative fuel market mandates. The Group recommends that voluntary targets be scrapped in favour of \\"mandated targets of five percent in 2010; 15 percent in 2015; and 20 percent in 2020\\". According to the report, the targets are required to fuel growth of investment in sustainable fuel industries, and wrest the grip of the energy market away from the small group of large oil and coal companies that dominate the industry. It goes on to say that: \\"Mandates beyond 20 percent will not be needed as market forces will take over beyond that point\\". #Tax incentives for vehicles running on alternative fuels or propulsion systems. The Group suggests that tax incentives be given to producers of greener cars, and to consumers who purchase such vehicles. #Tax incentives for alternative fuels and infrastructure. The group suggests that tax intensives should be given to any establishment that comes up with clean fuels or constructs the infrastructure required to develop the industry. Also, it suggests giving exemptions to fuel tax for those who use alternative fuel. #Wind back subsidies that reinforce oil dependence. This is in particular reference to the A$10 billion worth of subsidies handed out to producers and users of fossil-fuel transport fuel. #Use of Green Car Fund. This is in reference to the federal government's pre-election promise to provide a Green Car Fund for the country's motor industry. #State governments to play their role. Here, the Group suggests that state governments adjust their taxes and tariffs. For example, consumers who drive vehicles that consume lesser amounts of fuel should be made to pay lower registration fees. #Allow carbon credits to grow alternative fuel industries. The idea is that to encourage growth in the alternative fuels industry, the government should allow carbon credits to be awarded to players in that industry. #Foster urban public transport and sustainable mobility options. Here, the group calls for improved public transport infrastructure and for better facilities for walking and cycling. Types of financial subsidies The International Energy Agency defines an energy subsidy as: \\"...any government action that concerns primarily the energy sector that lowers the cost of energy production, raises the price received by energy producers or lowers the price paid by energy consumers.\\" Carrots and Sticks: Taxing and Subsidising Energy accessdate=2008-08-04 format=html There are six types of financial subsidies practiced: #Direct financial transfer: This is usually the simplest type of subsidy to recognize since governments normally declare these in yearly budget reports. Such subsidies can come in the form of rebates, direct subsidies, grants or low- interest loans. #Tax expenditure: These are incentives, rebates, exemptions and benefits offered by the tax system. #Energy related services provided by the public service at lower than the actual cost: Items that fall under this category are: Government spending in energy infrastructure and services, public grants for studies conducted on energy-related subjects and subsidies given to run facilities and services that fall below reaching the supposed return on investment. #Capital cost subsidies: These include subsidies on interest rates, debts, and liability guarantees. #Trade restrictions: These include restrictions such as embargoes, quotas and increased production cost. #Energy sector regulation: These include price controls, market protection policies and demand guarantees. Public opinion According to a survey conducted by Australian polling and market research company Newspoll in March 2008:Government subsidies: Full Newspoll results accessdate=2008-08-05 format=pdf #60% of all respondents from all states said that they would like to see a lot more resources pumped into subsidising renewable energy, while another 30% said that they would prefer if both fossil fuel energy and renewable energy were given equal funding. #29% feel that the federal government provides more subsidies to fossil fuel energy compared to renewable energy. A further 26% are of the view that there is an equal level of funding, while 36% do not know. #56% of those who wanted to see equal or more funding for renewable energy want the federal government to kick in subsidies immediately, while a further 28% wanted action to be taken within the year.

The true history of the creation of Sloan Lake may never be officially known, but during the settlement of the Denver area in the mid to late 19th century, the lake did not exist. Since spring 1859, South Golden Road connecting Denver and the western suburb of Golden crossed through where Sloan Lake is now. In December 1866, under the newly enacted Southern Homestead Act, Thomas M. Sloan received a patent for the land from US President Andrew Johnson to use the land for agricultural purposes, farming, and cattle-raising.

The area surrounding the lake was once home to an amusement park and swimming facility known as Manhattan Beach. Opened to the public 27 June 1881, it was the first amusement park to be built west of the Mississippi River (it burned down in 1908 and was rebuilt as Luna Park later that year); mishaps, and competition from other such attractions in the vicinity (Elitch Gardens and Lakeside Amusement Park), led to its closure in 1914. Cooper Lake, a separate body of water just southeast of Sloan's Lake, fell under the jurisdiction of the federal Works Projects Administration in the 1930s, and a plan was developed which involved building channels beneath the surface of the water on both lakes.

Wildlife and Habitat  Sloan's Lake is a seasonal and year-round home to a variety of birds, fish and other wildlife. Birds include white pelicans, mallard ducks, Canada geese, seagulls, barn swallows, house finches, and common night hawks. Cormorants and herons find refuge from shore-based predators in colonies on Cooper Island and feed on black crappie, carp and trout stocked by Colorado Parks and Wildlife agency. The lake’s muddy flats and shallower waters provide habitat for wading birds such as avocets and semi-aquatic rodents including native muskrats and non-native nutria. Predators include fox and coyote, which are occasionally seen around the lake. Cottonwood trees, cattails and bluegrass grow along the shoreline, and the lake waters support duckweed, algae and other native and invasive aquatic plants. Sloan's Lake Park Sloan's Lake facing west, with the foothills of the Rocky Mountains in the background. At , Sloan's Lake Park is the second largest park in Denver (after City Park). Typical activities at the park include hiking, jogging and bicycling on the trails and sidewalks that surround the lake, and fishing and boating on the lake itself. There are basketball and tennis courts located in the park. An annual event known as the Dragon Boat Festival attracts thousands of visitors each summer, celebrating Asian American culture and civilization. Sloan's Lake neighborhood The neighborhood of Sloan's Lake has undergone rapid gentrification in recent years, with a corresponding appreciation in real estate values: the average price for a single family home in 2017 was $543,400, compared to the 2009 average of $259,000. According to the 2000 census, the average household income was $48,300; as of 2017, it is $66,618. The Average Price per Square foot for a home in June, 2017 was $311.16. The housing stock in Sloan's Lake is diverse with a wide range of housing and styles including 1920s brick bungalows to new, post-modern architecture. More than 66 percent of Sloan's Lake residents own their home, an above average figure for Denver. A construction boom has also characterized the Sloan's Lake neighborhood in recent years, with a flurry of both single family homes and apartment units being built. The closure of St. Anthony's Hospital, which encompassed a seven- block radius to the south of the park, has allowed for an ambitious residential redevelopment that will include a 12-story condominium tower, a 369 unit apartment building, and a bevy of restaurants and shops.

Clockwork Girl tells the tale of a nameless robot girl who has recently been given the gift of life from her creator. While she explores the wonders of an ordinary world she meets an amazing mutant boy and they share a friendship that must overcome their warring families. In 2008, Telefilm Canada announced that they had funded the property for a possible future film adaptation. The film, The Clockwork Girl, has been released. Characters=Main characters * Tesla, the Clockwork Girl: (protagonist) is a young robot girl learning how to live in a world of adults. She looks at strangers like a kid in a candy store and wants to know everything about this new world around her. The character's name was inspired by inventor Nikola Tesla, and Kevin Hanna's earlier zine \\"Clockwork Girls hate Electronic Boys\\". * Huxley the Monster Boy: the unruly creation of Doctor Dendrus, is brash and adventurous. This often gets him into predicaments that only his foolhardy adolescent fearlessness can get him out of. In his own mind he has always been cool and in control, which is to say until Tesla the Clockwork Girl turned his life upside-down. The character was named after author Aldous Huxley, and not \\"Darwin's bulldog\\" Thomas Huxley as many have assumed. * Maddox: Huxley's best friend, who got almost killed by T-Bolt ((Scroll down for info)) and caused Wilhelm and Dendrus to trust each other. * Wilhelm The Tinkerer: a wild eyed eccentric egomaniac and the world's most brilliant machine scientist. He blames the natural sciences for holding back the machine age with a zealous fervor and believes the Clockwork Girl is his key to Dendrus's undoing. He views the Clockwork Girl as his greatest accomplishment. It's not until she is threatened that he realizes that she is so much more. * Doctor Dendrus: an offbeat father trying to keep up with his unconventional and untamed son, Huxley. He cares for his son a great deal but is overly protective and shelters him as much as he can. Dendrus is the Tinkerer's former friend, his chief rival and the world's greatest biologist. Supporting characters * T-Bolt: The Tinkerer's first machine man and biggest failure. Named after Tybalt of Romeo and Juliet. * The Marmokeets: Vicious mutations that infest the city like rats. They are pygmy marmoset/parakeet hybrids. Locations All of the events of the books take place (for the most part), in the city of Harfang. Each Scientist's castle are at opposite ends of the city. *The Mechanized Castle: The Tinkerer's mechanized fortress *The Living Castle: Dendrus' living castle *The Great Cypress: A giant tree that Huxley shows Tesla on their first day out together, which she later hides in for shelter.

Originally raised as a militia formation in 1912, the 5th Brigade was re-raised for overseas service in 1915 as part of the Australian Imperial Force during the First World War. The brigade then served during the Gallipoli Campaign and on the Western Front. During the inter-war years, it was re-raised as a part-time formation as part of Citizens Military Force. It undertook garrison duties in Australia during the Second World War, but was not deployed overseas before being disbanded in 1944. Following the war, the brigade was re-raised in 1948 once again and it is currently a Reserve combined arms formation based in New South Wales and forms part of the 2nd Division. History The 5th Brigade traces its origins to 1912, when it was formed as a militia brigade as part of the introduction of the compulsory training scheme, assigned to the 2nd Military District. At this time, the brigade's constituent units had training depots located around New South Wales including Mosman, Neutral Bay, North Sydney, Chatswood, Hunter's Bay, Hornsby, Granville, and Parramatta.Australian Military Forces 1912, p. 18. Following the outbreak of the First World War, the 5th Brigade was re-raised in mid-1915 as part of the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) from volunteers for overseas service. Upon formation it consisted of four infantry battalions—the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th Battalions. Assigned to the 2nd Division, the majority of its personnel were drawn from men that had previously served in New Guinea with the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force.Bean 1941, p. 806. After formation, the brigade departed Australia, embarking for Egypt, in May 1915, and after a period of training, were dispatched to Gallipoli in August as reinforcements for the 1st Division, which had been there since April. The brigade subsequently took part in the August Offensive, as the Allies sought to break the deadlock that had descended on the peninsula. After the offensive failed, the 5th Brigade remained at Gallipoli, undertaking mainly defensive tasks until they were evacuated in December 1915 and withdrawn back to Egypt. In early 1916, the brigade was sent to France as part of the large-scale transfer of the AIF's infantry divisions to the European battlefield. For the next two-and-a-half years the 5th Brigade fought on the Western Front, taking part in numerous battles. In July 1916, they were committed to the Battle of Pozières, after which the brigade was moved to Belgium before returning to the Somme. In May 1917, as the Germans withdrew to the Hindenburg Line, the brigade took part in the Battle of Lagnicourt in April 1917 and then the Second Battle of Bullecourt in May. Later in the year they were heavily committed, joining actions at Menin Road in September 1917 and Pelcappelle in October. In early 1918, the Germans launched the Spring Offensive, during which the 5th Brigade fought a series of defensive actions in the Somme Valley, before taking part in the final Allied offensive that eventually brought about an end to the war. During this time they were involved in the battles at Amiens in August, Mont St Quentin in September, and Montbrehain in October. Following the end of the war, the 5th Brigade was disbanded, however, it was re-raised in 1921 as part of the Citizens Military Force when Australia's part-time military forces were reorganised to replicate the structure of the AIF. Based in New South Wales, and headquartered in Sydney,McKenzie-Smith 2018, p. 2063. at this time it consisted of the 4th, 20th, 36th and 54th Battalions, and was once again force assigned to the 2nd Division. During the Second World War, the brigade was reduced to three infantry battalions after the Australian Army adopted the British brigade structure—initially the 20th, 54th and 56th Battalions—although its composition changed several times during the war, with various other units including the 44th Battalion joining the brigade. It was mobilised for full-time defensive service in December 1941 following Japan's entry into the war and concentrated at Bathurst. It undertook defensive duties in New South Wales and Western Australia throughout the war. In January 1944, the brigade moved to Queensland to begin preparing for operations in New Guinea. These plans were not enacted and the brigade was disbanded in June 1944 as part of the reallocation of manpower and resources undertaken by the Army at the time to reinforce operational units that were already deployed.Grey 2008, p. 188.McKenzie-Smith 2018, pp. 2063–2064. In 1948, the CMF was established once more, albeit on a limited scale and the 5th Brigade was re-raised as part of the 2nd Division.Palazzo 2001, p. 238 In 1960, with the introduction of the Pentropic divisional structure, the brigade ceased to exist as it was decided to move away from the traditional triangular formation. The Pentropic structure was abandoned in 1965, however, and the Army returned to the previous tropical establishment. The brigade was reformed at this time, albeit under the guise of the \\"5th Task Force\\", and consisted of three battalions—3 RNSWR, 4 RNSWR and 17 RNSWR. In 1982, it reverted to the designation of \\"5th Brigade\\" and in 1987 all Reserve formations were reduced to two infantry battalions. Today, 5th Brigade is a combined arms formation of the Australian Army Reserve, based in New South Wales and it is one of six brigades of the 2nd Division. Under Plan Beersheba the reserve 5th and 8th Brigades are partnered with the regular 7th Brigade. The 8th Brigade was later re-roled as a training brigade, after which many former 8th Brigade units, including its engineers, were transferred to the 5th Brigade. Current composition The brigade's subordinate units are as follows: *Headquarters 5th Brigade (located at Holsworthy Barracks, Sydney) *1st/15th Royal New South Wales Lancers (located at Lancer Barracks, Parramatta) *1st/19th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (located at Orange) *4th/3rd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment (located at Sutherland) *2nd/17th Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment *41st Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment *5th Engineer Regiment *5th Combat Service Support Battalion *8th Combat Service Support Battalion NotesReferences  * * Category:Brigades of Australia Category:Military units and formations established in 1915 Category:1915 establishments in Australia ","title":"5th Brigade (Australia)"},{"id":"18710866","text":"is a Japanese song by Kome Kome Club released on April 8, 1990.

The film was screened retrospective on 13 August 2016 at the Independence Day Film Festival jointly presented by the Indian Directorate of Film Festivals and Ministry of Defense, commemorating 70th Indian Independence Day. Summary Udham Singh was born and brought up in a Kamboj Sikh family in Punjab, India, during the time when the British ruled India. Enraged at the massacre of over 20,000 men, women, and children at the hands of Brigadier General Reginald Edward Harry Dyer (Tom Alter) in Jallianwalla, (now known in History books as the Jallianwalla Bagh Massacre) Udham Singh swears vengeance. He sets about creating obstacles for the British, and is soon on wanted lists by the authorities. On one occasion he is shielded by a courtesan, Noor Jehan (Juhi Chawla). In order to achieve his vengeance, he travels to the United Kingdom, befriends the local Indians, as well as Irish Freedom Fighter, Irene Rose Palmer (Charleen Carswell). He kills Michael O'Dwyer (Dave Anderson), the Lieutenant Governor of the Punjab in 1919 who had authorised Dyer's use of force, during a presentation at Caxton Hall in London. He is quickly apprehended, and jailed. He refuses to cooperate with the authorities, nor is he willing to accept that he is mentally incapable. During his trial, he is offered the opportunity to state his case for acquittal but his remarks were deemed incendiary by the judge, who forbade the press from publishing them. He was hanged on 31 July 1940 at Pentonville Prison in north London.

Dowd, 359 U.S. 394 (1959), was a United States Supreme Court case.. It involved an escaped convict's (Leslie Irvin) denial of appeal. The convict sought a federal writ of habeas corpus. Irvin v. Dowd was one of the first of many cases to underscore the \\"swing vote\\" role played by Justice Potter Stewart, who recently had come to the Supreme Court and was caught between the two warring camps of justices—the liberal camp of Justices Earl Warren and William Brennan, and the conservative one headed by Justice Felix Frankfurter. Stewart was in the ideological center of the Supreme Court at the time. Factual background The Irvin case centered on a series of murders in Evansville, Indiana, from 1954 to early 1955. In April 1955, local police arrested Leslie Irvin, announcing he had confessed to the crimes.. Irvin's lawyers sought a change of venue for the case to avoid local biases, but they lost; a third of the jury was seated despite statements showing they had prejudged the defendant to be guilty. Irvin was sentenced to death in January 1956; he soon escaped from jail, leaving a note maintaining his innocence and alleging police misconduct and public prejudging of his case, as well as asking his lawyer to appeal.. Irvin was soon recaptured, and the Indiana Supreme Court would reject his motions for appeals.. Irvin's lawyer came to the Supreme Court asking for a writ of habeas corpus. Legal issues The case came to the Supreme Court to decide the question of whether Irvin's escaping from custody forfeited his right to appeal. Beyond that, the justices on the court prone to judicial restraint (Frankfurter, Harlan, Clark, and Whittaker) were usually not supportive of the idea of a federal court issuing a writ of habeas corpus in a state prosecution case. Brennan and Warren were concerned with the jurors who were allowed to sit on the case despite having prejudged the outcome. Justice Stewart at first felt that court precedent, especially the case of Brown v. Allen, precluded the Supreme Court from getting involved in the state prosecution.. Brennan managed to distinguish the Brown case and convinced Stewart to vote with him, bringing about a 5-4 majority for the liberals. Brennan wrote an opinion forcing the state of Indiana to consider Irvin's appeal on the basis of the jury issue; he did not reach the matter of Irvin's escape. Outcome Justice Brennan wrote an opinion holding that Irvin's exhaustion of state remedies did not bar a federal court's granting habeas corpus. Stewart issued a one-line concurrence distinguishing the case from Brown v. Allen. The four judges in the minority, Frankfurter's bloc, saw the case as an example of the Court overreaching. Frankfurter resented the interposition of federal court review over state criminal actions. Aftermath Though Justice Brennan had begun his Supreme Court career voting with Justice Frankfurter about half the time, the Irvin case marked the end of a meaningful relationship between the two justices.. Frankfurter convinced a distinguished Harvard Law professor, Henry M. Hart, Jr., to focus on the case in the law school's Harvard Law Review as a means of character-assassinating Justice Brennan.. Despite ideological divides, when the case came back to the Supreme Court nearly two years later, the Court managed to write a unanimous opinion again remanding the case to state court, due to the original trial depriving Irvin of Fourteenth Amendment due process. Justice Clark's majority opinion underscored the need for impartiality in the jury: \\"In essence, the right to jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair trial by a panel of impartial, 'indifferent' jurors.\\" Justice Frankfurter wrote a concurrence on the media and its coverage's way of preventing jurors from delivering impartial verdicts.

The project was developed by Meridian Energy from 2006 to 2012 at a cost of $8.9 million. It had a proposed capacity of up to 630MW, at the time making it the largest wind farm project in the southern hemisphere. The proposed farm would have covered an area of approximately 92 km², used up to 176 wind turbines and cost up to $2 billion. Meridian initially won resource consent for the project in 2007, but these were overturned by the Environment Court in 2009, and Meridian eventually announced it was withdrawing its application for consent in January 2012. The project was named after engineer Eben Ernest Hayes (1851–1933), founder of the Hayes Engineering Works in Otago. He developed a windmill to power his engineering works from 1910 to 1927, and manufactured windmills for pumping water on farms.  Resource consent process  In May 2006, Meridian announced three public consultation days to explain Project Hayes. Between July and October 2006, Meridian lodged applications for resource consents with the Central Otago District Council and with Otago Regional Council. Resource consents for Project Hayes were granted in 2007, however the decision was appealed to the Environment Court. The project was opposed by a number of people, including the former All Black Anton Oliver who is also opposing the nearby Mahinerangi Wind Farm. The respected painter Grahame Sydney and poet Brian Turner also opposed the wind farms. Meridian spent more than NZ$7.6 million on the consenting process. In November 2009, the Environment Court declined the consents as they concluded that the project did not achieve sustainable management under the Resource Management Act 1991 because the substantial adverse impacts, principally on the outstanding natural landscape, outweighed the positive factors, principally the large quantity of renewable energy. Meridian stated that the Environment Court, in requiring a comprehensive and explicit cost-benefit analysis including hypothetical projects, had effectively created a new legal test for projects to overcome. Consequently, Meridian appealed the Environment Court decision to the High Court. In August 2010, the High Court allowed Meridian's appeal and sent the case back to the Environment Court to be reconsidered, with Meridian to present further evidence on alternative locations. The opponents of the project (the Maniototo Environmental Society, Upland Landscape Protection Society, John and Sue Douglas and Ewan Carr) filed notice to appeal the High Court Decision to the Court of Appeal. Meridian's lawyers asked the High Court to clarify its decision in respect of the Central Otago district plan landscape categories. As of February 2011, no dates had been set for the next round of court hearings. In January 2012, Meridian announced it had withdrawn the applications for resource consent. Meridian Chief Executive Mark Binns stated \\"... other projects now are a higher commercial priority than Project Hayes\\".

Wunderlichs were designed to be used as full-wave detectors in AM radio receivers. However, because of their unusual design, they were rarely used in commercially manufactured receivers. The tube is named for its inventor, Norman Wunderlich. Structure The Wunderlich tube is a twin medium-mu triode. The tube has two identical control grids that operate in tandem with a common heater, indirectly heated cathode and plate. Function Typically, the two grids are connected to opposite ends of the center-tapped secondary of the final IF transformer. The center tap of the secondary is then connected to ground through a parallel-connected resistor and capacitor circuit. This causes the tube to act as a full-wave grid leak detector. In some circuits, the center tap also provides AVC bias voltage to the converter and/or IF amplifier. Some Wunderlichs, like the Wunderlich B, have a diode plate or a second grid that provide AVC bias voltage. External links *Schematic of the Mission Bell model 19 car radio.

As well as being human cannonballs, the brothers were also wire walkers, tumblers, trapeze artists and riders.

Calculations were made to ensure the safety of those flying; sometimes, the cannon had to be readjusted in the performance city. Much of the calculation testing consisted of trial and error. Air pressure and windiness were factors that effected the projectile of the cannon. Although the cannon could be adjusted to account for these factors, there was no way to guarantee a safe flight. Edmondo and Hugo both suffered various injuries throughout the years. Edmondo broke his leg five times as a result of the act and had to have many surgeries. After the fifth break, he resorted to becoming the guy to press the button while Hugo shot out of the cannon. Hugo also suffered from a back injury after nearly missing the landing net.https://books.google.com/books?id=-ycDAAAAMBAJ&pg;=PA86&dq;=zacchini+brothers&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI2cy4x4PCyAIVRBk- Ch2ESw4k#v=onepage&q;=zacchini%20brothers&f;=false \\"Death-Defying Stunts of Dare-Devils.\\" Popular Science Aug. 1933: 24-87.

Subject of the book Although the book deals frankly with her often difficult relationship with her parents, Tin Pan Alley composer Milton Ager and his wife, columnist Cecelia Ager, in interviews author Alexander maintained she wanted to avoid writing a lurid, tell-all Mommie Dearest-type of celebrity confessional but rather “to tell this difficult story and to make a memorial to them. They were a remarkable couple, spanning a rich history of show business. And by the end they really did become my best friends.” Mary Alice Kellogg, “Shana Alexander Takes On the Toughest Subject, Her Family”, The New York Times, November 12, 1995. “When you write about your parents you have to find a balance and be truthful without sacrificing any dignity,” she said. “I feel I described my parents in a careful refinement of words.” Clyde Noel, “Shana Alexander Talks About Her Family”, The Los Altos (California) Town Crier, May 27, 1996. Although used to writing about difficult subjects and complicated, tough people (her previous books had included Anyone's Daughter, about Patty Hearst; Very Much a Lady about Jean Harris, the headmistress convicted of murdering Scarsdale diet author Dr. Herman Tarnower; and The Pizza Connection about Mafia drug dealing), in interviews, Alexander maintained that the look at herself and her own family, especially the complex, sometimes baffling relationship between her parents and her relationship with them was a daunting task. Alexander researched the book for five years and found difficult the fact that her parents, the primary subjects, refused to reveal key facts. \\"We were an allegedly open family, but our parents never told us anything,\\" Ms. Alexander said. \\"I had to do a lot of detective work to uncover the truth about my parents' lives. I knew almost nothing about them as people.\\" In the book, Alexander reveals a perplexing contrast between her parents public and private lives. On the surface, her parents lead glamorous lives and were the toast of the town. Her father Milton was a noted and highly successful composer whose songs included \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\", \\"Ain't She Sweet\\", and \\"I'm Nobody’s Baby\\"; her mother Cecelia wrote columns in Variety, was a Hollywood screenwriter, and Manhattan movie critic. Friends like George and Ira Gershwin, the Marx Brothers, Sophie Tucker, and Dorothy Parker were some of the frequent visitors to their homes in New York and Hollywood. Yet, in their private lives, the couple, who often lived in hotels, were temperamentally opposites, slept in separate rooms, and essentially led separate lives. Alexander describes her mother as cold and unattached and writes of her inability to express love to either her daughters or her husband. However, the marriage lasted 57 years. The book’s title, \\"Happy Days\\", taken from one of her father’s most famous songs, \\"Happy Days Are Here Again\\" is ironic “because my childhood was anything but,” Alexander said. Critical reception The book was praised for its craftsmanship and its intriguing subject matter, particularly around the unanswered questions concerning Alexander’s parents’ lives Delia Ephron, New York Times Book Review, November 5, 1995 and as a “moving autobiography of a life damaged by the chilly Cecilia’s inability to love her and her sister Laurel, and her beloved father’s inability to help.” “Picks and Pans”, People, December 4, 1995, Vol. 44, Issue 23 While noting the glittery atmosphere created by appearances of the many celebrities who were the Ager’s friends, Publishers Weekly summed up the book’s main achievement: “But ultimately what will stay with readers the most is Alexander's moving account of her parents, her relationships with them, and their relationship with each other.” John Smothers, Publishers Weekly, November 15, 1995.

The player-character Gomez receives a fez that reveals his two-dimensional (2D) world to be one of four sides of a three- dimensional (3D) world. The player rotates between these four 2D views to realign platforms and solve the game's puzzles. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments to restore order to the universe. The game was called an \\"underdog darling of the indie game scene\\" during its high- profile and protracted five-year development cycle. Fez designer and Polytron founder Phil Fish gained celebrity status for his outspoken public persona and his prominence in the 2012 documentary Indie Game: The Movie, which detailed Fez final stages of development and Polytron's related legal issues. Fez met critical acclaim upon its April 2012 release for Xbox Live Arcade. The game was ported to other platforms following the expiration of a yearlong exclusivity agreement. Reviewers commended the game's emphasis on discovery and freedom, but criticized its technical issues, in-game navigation, and endgame backtracking. They likened the game's rotation mechanic to the 2D–3D shifts of Echochrome, Nebulus, Super Paper Mario, and Crush. Fez won awards including the Seumas McNally Grand Prize and Eurogamer 2012 Game of the Year. It had sold one million copies by the end of 2013, and it influenced games such as Monument Valley, Crossy Road, and Secrets of Rætikon. A planned sequel was canceled when Fish abruptly left the indie game industry.  Gameplay  alt=A four-minute video of Fez footage shows a multicolored, floating cube guide an unclothed, bright white Gomez with small black eyes and a red fez navigate a tower though a screen rotation game mechanic. Gomez jumps between platforms cut into the tower and lined with grass. He also climbs vines and collects pieces of a golden cube, which each make a sound. Fez is a two- dimensional (2D) puzzle platform game set in a three-dimensional (3D) world. The player-character Gomez lives peacefully on a 2D plane until he receives a red fez and witnesses the breakup of a giant, golden hexahedron that tears the fabric of spacetime and reveals a third dimension. After the game appears to glitch, reset, and reboot, the player can rotate between four 2D views of the 3D world, as four sides around a cube-like space. This rotation mechanic reveals new paths through the levels by connecting otherwise inaccessible platforms, and is the basis of Fez puzzles. For example, floating platforms become a solid road, discontinuous ladders become whole, and platforms that move along a track stay on course. The object of the game is to collect cubes and cube fragments, which accrete to restore order to the universe. In search of these cubes, Gomez traverses the game environment by jumping between ledges. Other platforming elements change with the level themes, including crates that activate switches, bombs that reveal passages, and pistons that launch Gomez airborne. The exploratory parts of the game feature a series of arcane codes and glyphs, treasure maps and chests, and secret rooms. Players are left without guidance to determine whether game elements are decipherable subpuzzles or simply false signals. These sorts of puzzles include hidden warp gates, enigmatic obelisks, invisible platforms, sequences of tetrominos, a ciphered alphabet, and QR codes. One of the game's recurring themes is an ancient civilization that attempted to make sense of their dimensionality, as told through artifacts. Fez has no enemies, bosses, or punishments for failure—the player-character quickly respawns upon falling to his death. The game's designer described Fez as a stop and smell the flowers' kind of game\\". It prioritizes puzzle-solving and patience over the platforming genre's traditional interest in dexterity. Fez features a pixelated art style and a limited color palette reminiscent of the 8-bit era. Its homage includes Tetris tetrominos inscribed on the walls and in the sky, The Legend of Zelda treasure chest animations, Super Mario Bros. mushroom levels, travel by pipe, and floating platforms. The game's settings include forests, factories, a coastal lighthouse, an urban city, and a library. Fez New Game Plus mode adds a first- person perspective feature and lets the player revisit areas to collect \\"anti- cubes\\" from harder puzzles. This second half of the game is more challenging and focuses on code cracking.  Development  Fez five-year development cycle is known for its protracted length and amount of public exposure. Nathan Grayson of VG247 likened its rocky history to \\"an indie Duke Nukem Forever\\", and Polygon reviewer Arthur Gies noted its standing reputation as an \\"underdog darling of the indie game scene\\". Its designer, Phil Fish, became renowned in a way unusual for game developers due to his prominence in the 2012 documentary Indie Game: The Movie. Apart from Fez, which was released to wide acclaim, Fish himself became known for his outspoken and acerbic public persona. Fez began as a collaboration between Canadian indie developers Fish and Shawn McGrath. They worked on McGrath's idea for a puzzle game in which a 3D space was viewed from four 2D angles. Though their partnership broke down due to creative differences, the entirety of Fez design, story, and art descends from this game mechanic. Fish continued to work on the project in his spare time and solicited for a programmer on DeviantArt, where he found Renaud Bédard. Fez was first announced in July 2007 on The Independent Gaming Source. It was nominated for two awards at the 2008 Game Developers Conference Independent Games Festival (GDC IGF). When Fish's employer did not permit him time off to attend the awards, he quit. Fish later recalled this moment as \\"when [he] became indie\\". The game won \\"Excellence in Visual Art\\", and its presence created a surge of public interest in Fez that rode a concurrent swell of interest in indie game development as a whole. Fish received a Canadian government loan to open Polytron Corporation as a startup company and began full-time work on Fez. In July 2009, Polytron announced that Fez would launch in early 2010 as an Xbox Live Arcade exclusive. Development continued with an experimental spirit until the company ran out of money. Fish borrowed from friends and family to keep the company open and considered canceling the project before the nearby Québécois developer-publisher Trapdoor offered to help. Fish felt that the Trapdoor partnership rescued the game. Fez won multiple awards in 2011 and was a \\"PAX 10\\" selection at the 2011 Penny Arcade Expo. Fish is shown preparing for Fez booth at PAX East 2011, an earlier show, in the 2012 documentary film Indie Game: The Movie. The film chronicles the game development stories of several indie developers. As a subplot, the film presents Fish amidst a legal dispute with a former business partner that jeopardizes Fez future. Game Informer called Fish the film's \\"most memorable developer\\", and Rock, Paper, Shotgun wrote that Fish is portrayed as theatrical in a way that exacerbates his already outspoken reputation. Eurogamer said that the part when Fish resolves to kill himself if he does not release his game is \\"the film's most startling moment\\". Near the end of Fez development, Fish told a Gamasutra reporter that he had received positive feedback from IGF Chairman Brandon Boyer and Braid designer Jonathan Blow, but that he felt \\"burnt out\\". The final game included almost none of the original work from the first two years of development. After several delays, Fez was submitted for certification in February 2012. alt=Four males from the development team stand with an atom-like trophy with a GDC backdrop. From left to right, Vreeland has long, messy hair, rectangular glasses, a TV static-like sweater, and is unshaven. His arm is around Fish, whose brown hair is combed back. He wears thick black glasses frames and a black shirt underneath a gray cardigan. McCartin has brownish-red hair and a goatee, and wears a Fez logo T-shirt underneath a red zippered hoodie. Bédard is a head taller than the bunch, and has short, brown hair, rectangular glasses, and is unshaven. He wears a black and white checkered dress shirt, a black tie, and a zippered, black hoodie. Fez was released on April 13, 2012, and sold 200,000 copies during its yearlong exclusivity to the Xbox Live Arcade platform. Fish rebuked Polytron's co-publisher, Microsoft Studios, for botching the game's release by way of lackluster publicity. Several months later, Polytron entered a high- profile dispute with Microsoft over the cost of patching Fez. Nearly a year after Fez launch, Fish announced a Windows PC port for release on May 1, 2013. OS X and Linux ports debuted on September 11, 2013, and PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita ports by BlitWorks debuted on March 25, 2014. Ouya and iOS ports were also announced; the iOS release began development in April 2017 and was released in December 2017. No Android release is planned. Bédard stayed to port the Windows release before joining Toronto's Capybara Games. He credited Polytron's long development cycle to his own inexperience in game development (compounded by the team's small size and difficulty in setting reasonable milestones), the game's scope, and Fish's perfectionism. Fish had hoped that players would discuss Fez nuances online after its release. Players collaborated online for a week to solve the final \\"monolith\\" puzzle by using a cryptanalytic attack known as brute force. Ars Technica described the apparent end to Fez harder puzzles as \\"anticlimactic\\", but Fish told Eurogamer in March 2013 that hidden in-game secrets remain to be found. More than three years after its digital launch, Fez received a physical release designed by Fish and limited to a signed edition of 500 in December 2015. The deluxe package included the soundtrack and a stylized red notebook with gold foil inlay. Though Bédard had moved on to another company, he continued to work on the game in secret. In August 2016, he released a final patch for the computer releases of Fez that included performance improvements, as a result of a unified codebase under an open source software library, and features such as a speedrun mode.  Design  alt=McGrath gesticulates with both hands while looking to the left. He wears aviator sunglasses, a black T-shirt with a sunglasses graphic, and has a long, brown beard. He is in an outdoors, camping setting. Bédard wrote Fez in Microsoft Visual C# Express and XNA Game Studio Express. He coded the level editor and the game engine, Trixel, which converts 2D tiles (\\"triles\\") into four-sided 3D voxels (\\"trixels\\"). Fish made 2D pixel art in Photoshop for each side of the trixel, which Bédard's custom software compiled into 3D game assets. Fish would then design levels in the level editor by extruding surfaces, a process he found \\"overwhelming\\" but akin to playing with Lego blocks. In their workflow, Fish first proposed ideas that Bédard would implement. The two would then discuss and fine-tune the addition—they worked well together. The game came to adopt Metroidvania mechanics, with \\"secret passages, warp gates, and cheat codes\\". Fish cited Myst as an inspiration and compared its open world, nonlinear narrative, and \\"obtuse metapuzzles\\" to Fez own alphabet, numeric system, and an \\"almost unfairly hard to get ... second set of collectibles\\". He was also inspired by the Nintendo Entertainment System games of his youth (particularly those of the Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda series), Hayao Miyazaki's signature \\"open blue sky\\", \\"feel-good\\" atmosphere, and Fumito Ueda's Ico. Fish sought to emulate Ico feeling of nostalgic and isolated loneliness, and Ueda's development philosophy wherein all nonessential game elements are removed (\\"design by subtraction\\"). Fish made a personal challenge of designing a game without relying on \\"established mechanics\\". As such, Fez was always a peaceful game that never contained an antagonist.  Music  alt=Vreeland's face is close-cropped and bright with a harsh flash. He is in a very dark, indoors setting, and wears a red and black plaid shirt. He is white and has short, dark hair, some stubble, and no glasses. alt=This medley begins with the roll of the ocean and eases into a synthesizer sequence with heavy fuzz and distortion. Rich Vreeland, also known as Disasterpeace, composed the game's chiptune-esque electronic soundtrack. Despite his background in chiptune, Vreeland limited his use of that genre's mannerisms in the score. He worked with soft synth pads and reverb to push the score closer to a 1980s synthesizer sound. He also reduced reliance on percussion and incorporated distortion techniques like bitcrushing and wow. Vreeland opted for slower passages with varying tempos that could \\"ebb, flow, and breathe with the player\\". He left some portions of Fez without music. Vreeland worked on its soundtrack at night for about 14 months while scoring Shoot Many Robots, and Brandon McCartin of Aquaria contributed the game's sound effects. Vreeland's first composition for the game (\\"Adventure\\") became the soundtrack's first track. He wrote it after meeting Bédard but before discussing the soundtrack with Fish, and based the composition on Fez audio created prior to his arrival. Vreeland wanted to use tape recorders for their distinctive sound, but potential audio synching issues with this method led him to employ digital recording. Portions of the soundtrack dynamically change between several dozen constituent elements and react to the game environment. For example, the \\"Puzzle\\" track's elements change musical key based on the in-game time of day. Certain tracks were intended to imitate real-world sounds, such as those of bats, thunderstorms, taiko, and water falling from stalactites. Other tracks expanded from improvisations. Vreeland was also inspired by the Lord of the Rings Shire theme, 1980s horror media, the soundtrack of demoscene game Jasper's Journeys, the Legend of Zelda dungeon music, the Mass Effect soundtrack, Tangerine Dream, and Steve Reich. \\"Continuum\\" is a synthesized rendition of Frédéric Chopin's Prelude, Op. 28, No. 4. Instruments used in recording include the Sonic Charge Synplant, minimoog, \\"synthetic flute\\", and Boomwhacker. The soundtrack was released in a digital format on April 20, 2012. Pre-orders for the soundtrack topped the Bandcamp charts. Kirk Hamilton of Kotaku wrote that Fez sound effects evoked Jim Guthrie's Superbrothers: Sword & Sworcery EP audio. Janus Kopfstein of The Verge called the work \\"fantastic\\" and described it as a cross between a \\"1980s Vangelis synth odyssey\\" and a submerged vinyl record from an arcade. Game Informer Matt Miller wrote that the soundtrack contributed to Fez \\"80s Nostalgia vibe\\". Eurogamer described the music as \\"lush, spooky, and electrifying\\", and Edge compared it to \\"Holst put through a Mega Drive\\". Oli Welsh of Eurogamer wrote that the music matched the game's themes of \\"hidden depth\\". Welsh heard influences of 1960s English psychedelia (Pink Floyd, Soft Machine), 1970s Krautrock (Tangerine Dream and Kraftwerk), 1980s synth (Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis), and Erik Satie. He added that the soundtrack's contribution to Fez was \\"incalculable\\". Damian Kastbauer of Game Developer used Vreeland's soundtrack to show that a retrogaming aesthetic in sound and visuals could be both \\"futuristic and nostalgic\\" and provide the \\"right 'voice' to support the game's design intentions\\". Game Developer listed Vreeland in their 2012 Power 50 for his work on the soundtrack, which they described as \\"atmospheric, pensive, and maybe even a little bit melancholy\\". In keeping with Fez theme of secrets, images visible only through spectrogram were embedded into the soundtrack audio. Vreeland released a remix album, FZ: Side F, a year later on April 20, 2013. It features tracks from other artists, including Jim Guthrie. Vreeland later released another remix album, FZ: Side Z, and all three albums were included in the August 2013 Game Music Bundle 5.  Reception  Reviews upon Fez original release were \\"generally favorable\\", according to review aggregator Metacritic. Later releases received \\"universal acclaim\\". Each release was consistently among the top-rated releases for each platform's year. GameRankings ranks Fez within its top 100 highest-rated Xbox 360 games, top 20 PC games, and top 20 PlayStation 4 games. While in development, Fez had won the 2012 GDC Independent Games Festival's Seumas McNally Grand Prize, the 2011 Indiecade Best in Show and Best Story/World Design, the 2011 Fantastic Arcade Audience Choice Award, and the 2008 GDC Independent Games Festival's Excellence in Visual Art. Eurogamer gave Fez their highest rating and named the \\"perfect, wordless sci-fi parable\\" their 2012 Game of the Year. Digital Spy listed Fez eighth in its Best Games of 2012, ahead of high-budget games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 and Halo 4. Fez was chosen as the 2012 game of the year by Diamond Trust of London developer Jason Rohrer and Halo 4 lead game designer Scott Warner. The Windows PC port was Metacritic's tenth best- reviewed video game of 2013. The New York Times called Fez Fish's \\"tribute to 1980s gaming ... lovingly, almost excessively, devoted to the golden age of Nintendo\\". Arthur Gies of Polygon described its aesthetics as \\"so retro it hurts\\", citing its pixelated look, chiptune soundtrack, and ways of clueing the player without explicit guidance. Gies felt that though \\"8-bit nostalgia\\" was outmoded, Fez showed an understanding of its influences and was the \\"most authentic\\" of the style. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com called the game's minimalism \\"admirable\\" and likened its art style to that of Cave Story. Kotaku described Fez nostalgic manner as \\"the video game aesthetic\\". Oli Welsh of Eurogamer lamented how \\"retro pixel art\\" became an indie game cliché during the game's development, but felt that Fez transcended such stereotypes through its dedication to the wonderment of early Nintendo titles. \\"Fish clearly worships the Nintendo of his boyhood\\", he wrote. Welsh likened Fez to a 1970s, peace- loving, surrealist version of 2001: A Space Odyssey as imagined by Shigeru Miyamoto, and foresaw its social status as \\"the darling of a certain indie clique\\" with \\"studied hipster cool\\". Edge described the game as \\"a place built from gaming's history\\", whose playfulness makes it \\"an unexpected heir to Super Mario Bros.\\" with levels like well-crafted toys, and IGN video review said the game \\"drags the 8-bit era into the future\\". Journalists likened Fez rotation mechanic to the 2D–3D shifts of games like Echochrome, Super Paper Mario, and Crush. Early in development, Fish himself said that the idea is \\"nothing mind-blowing\\" and that the game could have been made \\"at any point in the last 15 years\\". Polygon Gies preferred how Echochrome used the perspective mechanic, and Tom McShea of GameSpot considered Fez mechanic a gimmick. Matt Miller of Game Informer thought that Fez realized the mechanic's potential better than other perspective-shifting games, and further commended Fez puzzle design and pacing up until the endgame. Miller also compared its story to that of the novella Flatland, whose protagonist similarly discovers the complexities of another dimension. 1UP.com Parish said that Fez rotation mechanic was deeper than that of Super Paper Mario and not as dependent on M. C. Escher themes as Echochrome. Edge felt that the mechanic was \\"far less self-conscious\\" and \\"more harmonious\\" than in Echochrome and Crush. The magazine wrote that Fez indoor puzzles were its best. Eurogamer Welsh compared the game's \\"wraparound platforming\\" to the 1980s game Nebulus and described the rotation mechanic as among the console generation's \\"most unusual technical challenges\\". Secrets of Rætikon took inspiration from Fez Reviewers commended the game's emphasis on discovery and freedom, but found its reliance on backtracking, particularly in the endgame, tedious. Parish of 1UP.com wrote that open-world action games like Metroid Prime all have these issues. Edge compared Fez esoteric tricks to an older age of game development that packed games with Easter eggs, secrets, and codes, citing titles such as Exile and Jet Set Willy. The magazine also came to appreciate the 3D map. IGN's Mitch Dyer contrasted the game's riddles to the Metal Gear Solid codec frequency puzzle. Jeffrey Matulef of Eurogamer related his experience to the feeling of first playing the 1994 Myst, and The New York Times called Fez \\"a Finnegans Wake of video games\\" for its codebreaking that \\"makes the player feel like John Nash as portrayed by Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind\\". Game Informer recommended Fez for completionists who seek challenges. Polygon Gies was uncertain as to whether the game's technical frame rate issues were intentional, and described this dilemma as having a \\"certain genius\\". Other reviewers noted its technical faults: Game Informer as minor, and 1UP.com as \\"easily the glitchiest game I've played on my 360\\". Fez sold 20,000 copies in its first day, 100,000 in less than two months, 200,000 within a year, and, after the Humble Bundle, one million by the end of 2013. It was Xbox Live's 13th best-selling Arcade title of 2012. Fez was cited as an inspiration for 2014 indie games Monument Valley, Crossy Road, and Secrets of Rætikon.  Canceled sequel  Fez 2 was announced as \\"one more thing\\" at the end of the June 2013 Horizon indie game press conference, held during the annual Electronic Entertainment Expo. The project was canceled a month later following a Twitter argument between Fish and video game journalist Marcus Beer. In an episode of Beer's GameTrailers show Invisible Walls, the journalist criticized Fish's response to questions about Microsoft's Xbox One self-publishing policy change. Fish replied on Twitter with condemnation for the industry's negativity and, in a final tweet, announced both Fez 2 cancellation and his exit from the industry. The news came as a surprise to the rest of his company, which has not commented on upcoming projects other than ports since the sequel's cancellation. Polygon listed Fish in their top 50 newsmakers of 2013 for the social power of his \\"caustic use of Twitter\\".

He weighed about six tons and was over ten feet tall.Andrea Friederici Ross. Let the Lions Roar. Brookfield, Illinois: Chicago Zooological Society, 1997. 62. After attacking and nearly killing his keeper in 1941, Ziggy was chained to the wall of an indoor enclosure, and remained there for nearly three decades. His confinement became a cause célèbre in the late 1960s, when school children and other animal enthusiasts began campaigning for his release. Ziggy was briefly allowed to go outside in 1970, and a year later, the zoo completed a new outdoor facility specifically designed for the elephant. However, Ziggy only enjoyed a few years of freedom before dying in 1975. Early years Born in Asia, Ziggy was named after Florenz Ziegfeld, who purchased the elephant from John Ringling in 1920. Ziegfeld thought the elephant, then a 250-pound youngster, would be a good birthday present for his six-year-old daughter. However, the elephant was sold back to Ringling after the animal reportedly trampled through the Ziegfelds' greenhouse.Edward Baumann. \\"Brookfield's rebel, Ziggy, dies quietly\\". Chicago Tribune. October 29, 1975. A1. Ringling, in turn, sold the elephant to Singer's Midget Circus. While touring with Singer's troupe, Ziggy bonded with a dwarf named Charles Becker, who taught the elephant how to dance, play a harmonica, and smoke cigarettes.Ross, 63. At the San Diego Exposition Children's Circus in February 1936, Becker fell ill, and Ziggy was paired with a new handler, Johnny Winters. However, the elephant did not respond well to Winters, and fled from the grounds. Ziggy was later found in Balboa Park, and Becker was called from his sickbed to coax the elephant out.\\"Midget's whistle brings back Ziggy, runaway elephant\\". Chicago Tribune. February 22, 1936. 2. Some reports claimed that Ziggy had killed a trombone player in the midst of his escape, but this was never verified.Michael Sneed. \\"What ever happened to ???\\" Chicago Tribune. January 10, 1983. A16. In any case, the circus decided it could no longer keep the elephant, and sold him to Brookfield Zoo. Ziggy arrived at Brookfield in July 1936 and became a popular attraction for visitors. Attack on Slim Lewis At Brookfield Zoo on April 26, 1941,Kevin Brown. \\"Mixed Up Elephant\\". Chicago Tribune. May 12, 1957. C8. Ziggy suddenly turned on his keeper, George \\"Slim\\" Lewis. The elephant first struck Lewis to the ground with his trunk and pulled him beneath his head. Ziggy then tried to gore Lewis, but the keeper dodged each attack by slipping between the elephant's tusks. Eventually, Ziggy lunged so hard that his tusks became lodged in the ground for several seconds. Sensing his chance to escape, Lewis pulled himself up by grabbing onto Ziggy's ear, then punched the elephant in the eye. With Ziggy momentarily stunned, Lewis jumped into the moat around the elephant's enclosure and climbed to the other side.Ross, 76. Despite his ordeal, Lewis was an animal lover, and he begged zoo director Robert Bean to spare Ziggy's life. Bean decided that the animal would not be killed, but would be kept inside the Pachyderm House at all times as a safety precaution. Later that day, Lewis returned to Ziggy's yard and, with the help of another elephant, led the animal indoors. For the next few decades, the animal would remain alone in a stall, attached to a wall with a chain of variable length.Michael Sneed. \\"Rogue elephant roams no more\\". Chicago Tribune. March 2, 1969. S15. Years later, Lewis explained that Ziggy was in the midst of his musth period on the day of the attack. Musth is a time of high testosterone levels in male elephants, leading to aggressive behavior, and Ziggy may have been agitated because keepers had been urging him to mate with a female elephant.\\"Pachyderm still chained to wall after 28 years\\". Chicago Tribune. May 31, 1970. SCL5. Campaign to free Ziggy In March 1969, Michael Sneed of the Chicago Tribune called attention to Ziggy's confinement, writing, \\"Ziggy's six-foot tusks, which once grew so long they crossed each other, now are decayed and broken. The once frequent majestic blasts from his huge trunk wail very rarely.... Ziggy refuses to face his visitors and turns toward the back wall, swaying back and forth, occasionally picking up stray articles of food thrown at him.\\" The article caused a sensation, and Brookfield Zoo was inundated with letters about Ziggy.Michael Sneed. \\"Story brings response; appeals filed for 'Ziggy'\\". Chicago Sun-Times. March 13, 1969. S3. Peter Crowcroft, who had recently become the zoo director, announced that he wanted to let Ziggy go outdoors again. However, he explained that the zoo would need to build a new $50,000 facility to accommodate the elephant, something they could not afford at the time.Michael Sneed. \\"Special zoo fund\\". Chicago Tribune. March 20, 1969. W1.Michael Sneed. \\"$4,000 toward new home\\". Chicago Tribune. June 26, 1969. NA1. In response, people throughout the Chicago area, particularly schoolchildren, began collecting money for the \\"Ziggy Fund\\". Many elementary schools and high schools organized fundraisers, and the Bellwood Boys' Club made a five-foot-tall papier-mâché statue of Ziggy, which they paraded through the streets while collecting quarters. A number of donations also arrived from overseas, including several from American soldiers who had been stationed in Vietnam.Ross, 144. In August 1970, the zoo received a major boost when William Sitwell, president of the Chicagoland Buick-Opel Dealers Association, pledged to match the money raised from individual sources.\\"Zoo elephant may get new outside area\\". Chicago Tribune. August 25, 1970. 2. As the Brookfield Zoo came closer to its $50,000 target, zoo officials decided they should see how Ziggy would react to being outdoors before building a new facility for the elephant. On September 23, 1970, Ziggy saw the sun for the first time in nearly thirty years when he was allowed to walk through a barricaded portion of his old yard.Sara Jane Goodyear. \\"Ziggy ends 29-year sentence\\". Chicago Tribune. September 2, 1970. A10. Slim Lewis traveled from Seattle, Washington, to escort the elephant outside. Ziggy stood at the doorway for about thirty minutes, then slowly came out and starting eating a bale of hay. After exploring the yard for an hour and a half, Ziggy went back inside. Ziggy's new outdoor facility was completed during the summer of 1971. Most of the $50,000 was spent on a remote control door, which would allow the elephant to go inside and outside without human intervention.Ross, 144-145. Ziggy finally entered his new home on August 28, 1971, in front of more than one thousand cheering people.Sara Jane Goodyear. \\"At last, sun shines for Ziggy\\". Chicago Tribune. August 29, 1971. 1. Over the next few months, the zoo added a wading pool to Ziggy's yard and refurbished his indoor stall.Michael Sneed. \\"Ziggy's winter love gets cold shoulder\\". Chicago Tribune. December 20, 1972. B13. Later years The next few years were generally quiet for Ziggy. In March 1975, however, Ziggy fell into the moat around his enclosure while trying to poke a zookeeper with his trunk. The elephant survived the fall, but broke a tusk and scraped his head. Workers poured 84,000 pounds (42 tons) of gravel into the moat to give Ziggy a ramp to climb. The elephant would not move for 31 hours, but when a zookeeper (Leroy Woodruff) opened a nearby door to a female elephant's enclosure, Ziggy decided to pull himself out. Once free, however, he ignored the female elephant and simply went toward his food.Weldon Whisler and Barbara Reynolds. \\"Ziggy free; forgets everything but food\\". Chicago Tribune. March 25, 1975. 3. A few months later, Ziggy laid down to rest in his indoor stall, rolled onto his side, and died while being bathed by Lewis. Zoo spokespeople said Ziggy had mainly died of old age, explaining that the animal's health had been declining long before he fell into the moat. Legacy Ziggy's remains were given to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago,Richard Phillips. \\"Field Museum opens the door on the secrets of nature\\". Chicago Tribune. September 24, 1982.

Anatomy and appearance  The holotype is four centimeters in length. It has a deep, oblong-shaped body, a deep, but short head, a long tail composed of 27 caudal vertebrae, a long, crest-like dorsal fin, a long, banner-like anal fin with 29 to 30 rays running from the posterior region of the body down the entire length of the tail, and two enormous, wing-like pelvic fins. The holotype (and only known specimen) was originally described as the remains of a larval (\\"youthful\\") form due to its small size and due to its strong similarity to the larval form of trachypterid ribbonfish.  Taxonomic Status  B. elegans' taxonomic has been debated since its description in 1983. Because it appeared to combine features of both taeniosomid lamprids (i.e., its larval form resembles those of oarfish and ribbonfish), and of bathysomid lamprids (the anatomy of the pelvis is extremely similar to that of sailfins), it was attributed to an incertae sedis position within Lampriformes. Further research placed it within Zeiformes, another group of acanthomorph teleosts.

He participated, most notably, as a newly minted 2nd lieutenant in the American Civil War, and later the Spanish–American War, where he served as executive officer of the 1st Marine Battalion during the 1898 landing at Guantanamo Bay, as well as the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, where he was involved with the China Relief Expedition commanding the 1st Regiment of Marines. At the time of his death in 1913, he was on the retired list as holding the rank of brigadier general. Service history During the Civil War, then Lieutenant Cochrane accompanied President Abraham Lincoln as a member of his guard at the dedication ceremony for the new Gettysburg Battlefield Cemetery where Lincoln delivered his famed Gettysburg Address. Assigned to the steam-sloop USS Plymouth, North Atlantic, West Indies and Centennial Exposition of 1875–78, commanding captain Edward Barrett on the cruise of USS Plymouth five hundred miles up the Mississippi River to Vicksburg, in the spring of 1877. In the latter part of the 19th century, Henry Clay Cochrane became an ardent advocate for reform within the antiquated Marine Corps. Among other things, his recommendations for changes to the Marine uniform, which had not been updated in 12 years, partly resulted in the adoption of the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor as the new Marine emblem in 1868, a uniform device which is still in use today. Photo of Alexandria, Egypt after the bombardment and fire of July 11–13, 1882 As a captain serving as the fleet Marine officer on board the sloop-of-war USS Lancaster, flagship of the European Station, he was present at the bombardment of Alexandria, Egypt, by the British Fleet in July 1882. During the operation, he accompanied a landing party along with Lieutenant Littleton W. T. Waller consisting of a mixed bluejacket and Marine force to suppress looting and to protect the U.S. consulate. The Naval landing force of sixty-nine sailors and sixty-three Marines was formed, with Lieutenant Commander Charles Goodrich in command and Captain Cochrane as executive officer. Two companies comprised the force, the sailors under Navy Lieutenant Frank L. Denny and the Marines under Lieutenant Waller. The timely arrival of the ships of the European Squadron and their landing forces gave protection to the American consulate and to American citizens and interests caught up in the fighting and also afforded a refuge for the citizens of other nations who had been displaced from their homes or businesses. Advancing cautiously through the burning and rubble strewn streets, the Americans reached the Grand Square of Mehmet Ali, the heart of the city. The American Consulate was here, and it became the headquarters of the force. Although the French troops had abandoned the city and cautiously returned to their ships, the Marines secured the Grand Square and began to patrol the streets of the European Quarter, as the international business and consular area was called. Cochrane, Waller and their Marines were assigned to Lord Charles Beresford’s British force for the protection of the European Quarter. The anticipated rebel counterattack never came, and a ten-day standoff ended with the arrival of the four thousand-man British relief force. According to the Times of London: \\"Lord Charles Beresford states that without the assistance of the American Marines he would have been unable to discharge the numerous duties of suppressing fires, preventing looting, burying the dead, and clearing the streets.\\" Cochrane was also present at the coronation of Czar Alexander III at Moscow in May, 1883. In 1898, then Major Cochrane was appointed second in command of the 1st Marine Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Robert W. Huntington and participated in the landing at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, during the Spanish–American War. During the Boxer Rebellion of 1900, he commanded the 1st Marine Regiment as part of the China Relief Expedition. Henry Clay Cochrane retired from active duty as a colonel in 1905, bringing to an end 42 years of service in the Marines. In 1911, he was promoted to brigadier general on the retired list. General Cochrane died on April 27, 1913, at the age of 71 in Chester, Pennsylvania.\\"The U.S. Marine Corps, An Illustrated History\\" by Merrill L. Bartlett and Jack Sweetman, Chapter 6, \\"At Sea in the Gilded Age\\" Memberships After the Civil War, Cochrane was elected as a Veteran Companion the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States and was assigned insignia number 455. In 1898, following his service in the Spanish-American War, he became a Companion of the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of Foreign Wars and was assigned insignia number 171.
