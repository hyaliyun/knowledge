He is the Principal Investigator for the Atmospheric Oxygen Research Group at Scripps and is the director of the Scripps Program, http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/personnel/ralph_keeling.html the measurement program behind the Keeling curve, which was started by his father Charles David Keeling in 1958. Ralph Keeling has developed precise instruments and techniques for the measurement of atmospheric oxygen and anthropogenic in the ocean, and for the analysis of land and ocean carbon sinks. Education Ralph Keeling, one of five children of Charles David and Louise (Barthold) Keeling, grew up in Del Mar, California. Ralph Keeling received a B.S. in physics from Yale University in 1979. He received a Ph.D. in applied physics from Harvard University in 1988 for developing a novel technique for the accurate measurement of atmospheric oxygen. Research Keeling developed his first scientific instrument, a light-gauging interferometer for the accurate measurement of atmospheric oxygen, as part of his Ph.D. research. By October 25, 1986, Keeling had developed a working prototype, a stainless steel box about seven feet tall, with a glass front. Inside the box, light beams shine through the gas molecules of air samples. Keeling's interferometer measures the speed of light at different wavelengths and determines the specific composition of the air and its oxygen content based on tiny variations in speed. The instrument Keeling developed was able to measure oxygen at a far more precise level than anything previously created, detecting differences of a few molecules per million. Keeling's Interferometric Oxygen Analyzer has enabled Keeling and many others to study atmospheric composition, the global carbon cycle, ocean biogeochemistry, paleoclimate and climate change. Keeling has collected data since 1989, leading to fundamental discoveries about the carbon cycle. His data indicates that atmospheric oxygen levels are dropping, in a curve that resembles the inverse of the Keeling curve for . However, the rate at which oxygen levels are decreasing is not as great as would be expected given the increase in . In a \\"landmark study\\" in 1996, Keeling demonstrated that land and ocean carbon sinks could be compared by examining the partial pressures of atmospheric oxygen and . Keeling's data supports the view that the land operates as a major carbon sink. Keeling also discovered that the land, trees and plants are absorbing at a higher rate than they have in the past. Although the land is releasing millions of tons of as a result of deforestation, thawing of permafrost, and other global warming-related phenomena, plants are growing faster and taking up more in response. This trend is not enough to counter rising levels in the atmosphere, but it is slowing their increase. Keeling is active in studying ocean warming, stratification of the upper ocean, and ocean deoxygenation. Ocean models predict declines in oxygen, and significant deoxygenation has been observed over the last fifty years in both North Pacific and tropical oceans. Keeling has studied Antarctic ice and glacial with Britton B. Stephens, modeling concentrations of atmospheric during both glacial and interglacial periods. With Stephens and others, Keeling hypothesizes about oceanographic processes that may have stabilized and destabilized the oceans over time, in particular about possible thermostatic effects of Antarctic ice. He studies Thermohaline circulation and circulation patterns in the Southern Ocean to better understand oceanic warming. Keeling is also involved in monitoring of local emissions over Los Angeles, including methane. Keeling is a strong proponent of ongoing measurement of atmospheric factors such as oxygen and carbon dioxide. He has appealed to government and to the public for continued funding to ensure that data continues to be recorded for the Keeling Curve and other scientific measures that monitor the air, land, and oceans. He is also a proponent of improved monitoring of the oceans. Awards and honors Keeling received the Rosenstiel Award in 1992, was an H. Burr Steinbach Visiting Scholar at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1998, and received the Humboldt Research Award in 2009 in recognition of his career achievements.

Curtis by the then Consolidated Shipbuilding Company of Morris Heights, New York. The name is taken from the historic name of his estate, Lyndon, in Wyncote, Pennsylvania. After Curtis' death in 1933 the yacht was purchased by Pan American Airways, converted to a floating hotel for use in the south Pacific and renamed Southern Seas in a shuttle service from Noum√©a to Australia. At the outbreak of World War II the vessel was taken over by the U.S. Army for use as a passenger and cargo ship until grounded on a New Caledonian reef. The ship was salvaged by the U.S. Navy, repaired in New Zealand, commissioned 23 December 1942 as USS Southern Seas and designated as a Patrol Yacht (PY-32). Yacht Lyndonia Lyndonia was named \\"Yacht of the Year\\" in the May 1920 issue of The Rudder and described as the largest and most completely fitted vessel of the kind since World War I had put a stop to such construction. She was launched 3 April 1920 with Curtis and a large party of friends as witnesses, including Curtis' captain, A. W. Rich. The ship was expected to be fitted out and ready for the season by 1 June. The yacht had three decks with the Jacobean style dining saloon, the early Tudor style smoking room and some accommodations on the main deck. Half of the lower deck was reserved for the owner and guest with six guest staterooms. The owner's apartments were created to resemble those found in a fine home ashore. The ship had a number of boats, the owner's 30-foot launch and a 24-foot crew's launch, two 22-foot life boats and an 18-foot dinghy. She was powered by four Seabury boilers with two oil burners to each and two triple-expansion steam engines with cruising speed of about 16 knots and range of 3,000 miles at that speed or 6,000 at 12 knots. Electricity was furnished by a 15 kW and a 30 kW General Electric generating set. She was fully equipped for navigation and had a ship stabilizer as well as gyrocompass built by Sperry Gyroscope Company. In 1925 the steam plant was replaced with two diesel engines. The ship had a crew of 39, and Curtis spent considerable time and did much of his business aboard. In a 1922 interview with New York Times reporter Rose C. Feld, Curtis stated \\"Yachting is not a hobby with me. It is a necessity. I spend half my time on this ship.\\" He noted that most of his meetings with his staff or directors were held in the Lyndonia's dining room and that he stationed the ship to facilitate meetings. Comparing his use, and its position as his second home, he told the reporter \\"Most yacht owners show an annual run of three thousand miles. Ten thousand miles of cruising is no unusual figure for the Lyndonia. The yacht spent winter months in southern waters with many references to its Florida visits in social pages and returned to Camden for summer with her whistle on arrival signaling \\"summer\\" to some. After Curtis' death on June 7, 1933, the ship was laid up much of the time until sold to Pan American Airways in 1940. Records related to the later sale of the vessel to the U.S. Army in 1940 mention \\"Corres. re: M. V. Southern Seas, including \\"A narrative relating to purchase and operation of the M.V. Southern Seas\\"; Bill of Sale from Mrs. Curtis (wife of owner of The Saturday Evening Post) to Pan American Airways, Inc.\\" Southern Seas Pan American Airways Pan American Airways acquired the ship and made modifications for use as a \\"hotel\\" ship and surface link for its Clipper service based in Noum√©a to Australia before it acquired landing rights in Australia. By September 1940 the ship was in Sydney for overhaul. The combination air-sea link between San Francisco and Sydney, made necessary by early British air lines' opposition to landing rights, was to be on a seven-day schedule with the ship's twenty luxurious staterooms providing the sea link for forty passengers at a cost of about ¬£24 Australian. The war in Europe was intruding with the German raider Orion having sunk ships and been active off New Caledonia in mid August 1940 and even flying a reconnaissance aircraft over Noum√©a that observed pro-de Gaulle and anti-Vichy crowds in public areas. Changed plans were indicated by early September with reports in connection with a report of high level visitors, including Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney, chairman of Pan American's directors, arriving by Clipper in Auckland by way of Noum√©a that the yacht was purchased as a \\"floating air base\\" and not as a surface connection to Australia. The tense political situation contributing to these decisions is noted in a report of Mr. Vanderbilt's description of Noum√©a with crowds demonstrating in favor of General de Gaulle under the guns of a Vichy warship, the Dumont d'Urville. By mid September 1940 agreement had been reached on sharing routes, part of Pacific defense plans reached at a Wellington, New Zealand conference, resulted in plans for the ship's surface shuttle being replaced by its use as a floating transit hotel in Noum√©a's harbor while the wartime political situation on the French island was resolved with the September 19 arrival of de Gaulle's representative Henri Sautot backed by HMAS Adelaide. Pan American Clipper at Noum√©a, 1941. By May 1941 the ship was described, in contrast to a somewhat shabby but free Noum√©a, as lying a half mile out in the harbor, a \\"dazzling white motor yacht\\" the \\"embodiment of smartness and comfort\\" with American officers and drink stewards, Melanesian deck hands and Japanese waiters that make passengers feel like millionaires at least for a night. The political situation's resolution in Noum√©a resulted in the ship and routes being under Free vice Vichy French control of the Pan American air link until U.S. entry into the war. U.S. Army After 7 December 1941 Pan American abandoned its commercial facilities in the Pacific war zone and requested they be taken over by the U.S. military. Southern Seas, along with other company property, was taken over by the U.S. Army and the seaplane base was kept operational by two Army Engineers, Captain MacCasland and Lieutenant Sauer, after Pan American evacuated its employees shortly after 7 December. On 30 Dec. 1941 the M.V. Southern Seas was purchased from Pan American Airways Inc. by the U.S. Army District Engineer (Hawaii) for the sum of one dollar while settlement was reached on value of the ship. The ship had been recommended for use as a transport supporting U.S. Army construction of South Pacific air ferry route airfields by Leif J. Sverdrup with some work surveying islands for suitable field locations. The Southern Seas was being used in February 1942 for accommodating airbase construction personnel in Noum√©a harbor with a meeting aboard described by Captain Norman Miller in I Took The Sky Road between himself, a Lt. Colonel Rich and 'Jack' Sverdrup, in charge of constructing airfields on a number of the islands, during a stop in Noum√©a harbor on the return flight of XPBS-1 from Java: > The luxury of the Southern Seas was a far cry from the cramped quarters of > the old XPBS, and I remained aboard over night, reveling in comforts > previously enjoyed by Pan Am's customers. But the yacht was of no further > use to Pan Am. Their service to New Zealand had been discontinued. The yacht > was to be turned over to Sverdrup to serve him as a floating office which > could follow him around among the islands. In the meeting they decided Sverdrup would fly from Noum√©a to Suva, Sverdrup's headquarters, with the former yacht following. On 22 July 1942 in Taruia Pass while en route to Penrhyn Island on an island charting assignment, the ship struck an uncharted reef and her engine rooms were flooded. U.S. Navy The Navy salvaged Southern Seas, towed the ship to New Zealand and made repairs before formally acquiring and commissioning the ship as USS Southern Seas (PY-32) on 23 December 1942. The ship was used as a quarters ship in Auckland, New Zealand, New Caledonia, Noum√©a, Gilbert Islands, Marshall Islands and the Marianas where she was located at Guam at the end of the war. She was dispatched to Okinawa where she arrived with the 15 September typhoon. During typhoon \\"Louise\\" of 9 October 1945, in which twelve ships were sunk, two hundred twenty-two grounded and thirty-two damaged beyond crew's capability to repair, Southern Seas suffered collisions with five other vessels before sinking with loss of thirteen crew.

He was the co-founder (with Ellendea Proffer) of Ardis Publishers, the largest publishing house devoted to Russian literature outside of the Soviet Union, and co-editor of Russian Literature Triquarterly (1971‚Äì91). A major force in Russian-American literary relations from 1969 until his death, Carl R. Proffer was at first known as a Slavic scholar. He received a PhD at age 25, and became a tenured professor at 34. He taught at Reed College, Indiana University and University of Michigan. A dedicated, accessible teacher, he took part in many aspects of university life, including by giving public lectures and organizing conferences. Proffer's first books were The Simile in Gogol‚Äôs \\"Dead Souls\\" (1968), a study of Nikolai Gogol's style, Letters of Nikolai Gogol (a translation) (1968), and Keys to \\"Lolita\\" (1968), the first study of Nabokov‚Äôs novel as serious literature. A reviewer in the TLS referred to these works as ‚Äúprofferized‚Äù: 'that is, exciting, energetic with the critic's own liveliness and enthusiasm pulsing through a scholarly apparatus formidable.... To have published these three studies within the space of a year is an astonishing achievement for a previously unknown scholar.' The book on Nabokov's novel and Proffer's memoirs, The Widows of Russia (1984), were published in Russian. Proffer went on to do numerous and translations, and edited many anthologies of Russian writing. Proffer wrote a series of articles about Soviet writers and censorship, several published in The New York Review of Books, and gave many radio and television interviews, believing that informing the public about culture under the Soviets was beneficial to both sides. In 1969, he and his wife traveled to the Soviet Union for six months, which proved to be the stimulus for the creation of Ardis Publishers. In spring of 1971, Ardis began with reprints of works in Russian by Mandelstam and Bulgakov and the first issue of Russian Literature Triquarterly (RLT) (1971‚Äì1991), which centered on Akhmatova, Mandelstam, Bulgakov and Joseph Brodsky. RLT was meant to reveal the many sides of Russian literature, focusing in particular on the writers little known in the West and repressed in the Soviet Union. It featured many photographs, translations and a texts and documents section in which Soviet scholars could publish important works under pseudonyms, to avoid persecution by the Soviet authorities. The last issue, published in 1991, was devoted to Nabokov, and was the occasion for tributes to the effect RLT had had on the field. Ardis and RLT made every effort to be literary rather than political, but this became harder as the seventies wore on. In 1972, Proffer and his family were in Joseph Brodsky's room when the poet was called in by the authorities and encouraged to leave before Nixon's visit to the Soviet Union. Proffer immediately told Brodsky, who at this time was little known in America, that he would get him a job as poet in residence at the University of Michigan. Proffer met Brodsky's plane in Vienna and after enormous effort got him an American visa and a place at the University of Michigan. Ann Arbor became a stop on the Russian literary underground railway, as a stream of prominent writers came to visit Ardis or teach at the university. Proffer mentored numerous √©migr√© writers, arranging for them to go into academia. Proffer made yearly trips to the Soviet Union until 1979, when the publication of the politically controversial anthology Metropol‚Äô caused him to be banned from the Soviet Union. Diagnosed with cancer in 1982, he would never see Russia again; he died in 1984, at the age of forty-six. He is survived by his wife and four children‚ÄîAndrew, Christopher, Ian and Arabella. A memorial evening in honor of Carl Proffer was held at the New York Public Library on April 1, 1985. Attending were Arthur A. Cohen, Sasha Sokolov, Joseph Brodsky, Susan Sontag and many other notable Russian and American literary figures. In his speech, Joseph Brodsky expressed his deep gratitude to Proffer for his many kindnesses as a friend and as a publisher. Through Ardis, Brodsky said, Proffer had done for Russian literature what Russia could not do for itself.

The Middle East and South Asia 2015-2016 Early history In the Palestinian legislative elections on 25 January 2006, Hamas emerged victorious and nominated Ismail Haniyeh as the Authority's Prime Minister. However, the national unity Palestinian government effectively collapsed, when a violent conflict between Hamas and Fatah erupted, mainly in the Gaza Strip. After the Gaza Strip was taken over by Hamas on 14 June 2007, the Authority's Chairman Mahmoud Abbas dismissed the Hamas-led unity government and appointed Salam Fayyad as Prime Minister. Though the Fatah-led government claimed authority over all West Bank and Gaza Strip, Hamas's control of the Gaza Strip limited its authority de facto to the West Bank. The Fatah-led government's budget derived mainly from various aid programs and the Arab League, while the Hamas government in Gaza was mostly dependent on Iran until the onset of the Arab Spring in 2011. Later history Since 2007, the Fatah government had continued to oversee the Palestinian-controlled territories in the West Bank, while the Hamas government has continued to control the Gaza Strip. A reconciliation agreement to unite their governments, signed in Cairo in 2011, was ratified by the 2012 Hamas‚ÄìFatah Doha agreement. Renewed tensions between them, however, plus the effects of the Arab Spring (especially the crisis in Syria) have postponed its implementation. In 2011, representatives of the Authority failed to have their United Nations (UN) status upgraded, although their UNESCO status was upgraded to state representation. In July 2012, the Hamas government in Gaza was reported as considering a declaration of the independence of the Gaza Strip, with the support of neighboring Egypt. A unity government was sworn in on 2 June 2014.

Truant was one of the most successful of Britain's undersea prowlers during that war. Background Haggard, only son of Admiral Sir Vernon Harry Stuart Haggard and his wife Dorothy Booker Ellis Haggard, was born on 21 June 1908 in Stock, Essex, England. His father was Commander-in-Chief of the America and West Indies Station. Hugh Haggard was the nephew of diplomat Sir Godfrey Digby Napier Haggard, who served as British Consul General at New York during World War II. He was also the grandnephew of prolific author Sir Henry Rider Haggard, who attained literary fame with his romances King Solomon's Mines and She: A History of Adventure. Naval career At , Haggard was one of the tallest submarine officers in the Royal Navy. By 15 September 1925, he had become a cadet and was serving in the battleship , of the Atlantic Fleet. He was a midshipman by 15 May 1926, and aboard the battlecruiser by 3 December 1926. By 1 September 1928, Haggard was an acting sub-lieutenant. That year, he attended the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. On 1 July 1929, Acting Sub- Lieutenant Haggard was promoted to sub-lieutenant and, in 1931, he served aboard the cruiser . On 2 December 1931, he became a lieutenant, continuing to serve on the Cardiff. By 17 May 1934, he was a lieutenant on the submarine , which had just been launched that year. By 1937, Haggard was serving as lieutenant aboard the submarine of the 4th Submarine Flotilla. Haggard assumed command of the H-class submarine in 1939, which he retained until 1940. In December 1939, he was promoted to lieutenant commander. Haggard assumed command of HMS Truant in the spring of 1940, succeeding Lieutenant Commander Christopher Haynes Hutchinson. In September 1940, Truant became one of the first T-class submarines to arrive in the Mediterranean. Truant, under the command of Lieutenant Commander Haggard, sank Provvidenza on 22 September 1940, during the course of her first Mediterranean patrol. In December of that year, an Admiralty communiqu√© indicated that: \\"His majesty's submarine Truant (Lieut. Com. H. A. V. Haggard) has been operating with great success against the Italian sea communications off the south of Italy.\\" The vessel had sunk at least one of the enemy supply ships in an escorted convoy off Cape Spartivento on the night of 13‚Äì14 December 1940. Two nights later, Truant successfully torpedoed an Italian tanker, which sank off the Calabrian coast. From her arrival in September 1940 to her departure from the Mediterranean in December 1941, at which time the vessel headed for the Far East, Truant completed eleven Mediterranean patrols. During that time, the submarine sank eight merchant vessels and a small destroyer, which totalled 27,553 tons. In addition, Truant was credited with a naval auxiliary weighing 1,080 tons, which was said to have \\"died of fright\\" and run aground (Truant's torpedoes never made contact with the ship.) In May 1941, Admiral Sir Andrew Cunningham indicated that \\"the operations of HMS/M Truant have been a model of daring and enterprise, tempered with just the right degree of caution.\\" Lieutenant Commander Haggard was twice mentioned in despatches, on 14 January 1941 and 14 October 1941. That same year, on 12 August 1941, he was the recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross. On 17 March 1942, he was appointed as a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order \\"for bravery and enterprise while serving in H.M.S. Truant during successful Submarine patrols.\\" In December 1942, Truant, commanded by Haggard and described at that time as \\"the most successful British submarine,\\" returned to Britain after an 80,000-mile, two and a half-year mission in which the vessel was credited with sinking or damaging at least 20 Axis ships. The vessel flew the Jolly Roger, with four stars and sixteen white bars, representing vessels successfully attacked with guns and torpedoes, respectively. Truant had seen action in the Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean, and Java Sea. On 31 December 1942, Lieutenant Commander Haggard was promoted to commander. He was in command of the Truant until 1943, when he transferred to the Elfin. By January 1945, Haggard served on the submarine depot ship Medway II. He was a commanding officer for submarines with another submarine depot ship, , from September 1945. He was executive officer of from 16 March 1947. Commander Haggard retired from the Royal Navy on 19 November 1953 for medical reasons. Later life Haggard married Lydia Constance Watson in 1957. In 1973, he served as master of the Clothworkers' Company. He was widowed on 11 March 1984. Retired Commander Hugh Haggard died in November 1991 in Northamptonshire.

The film stars Anson Mount, Xander Berkeley, and Ryan Donowho and deals with the effects of the addiction to the drug methamphetamine on a Texas family. In an interview appearing on indiewire.com, Pomes stated: \\"The story began about people who I have been around, living outside of civilization, out in the woods, down a dirt road with all the old stereotypes: the roof caving in and the tires in the front yard. The story is about that group of people, and the family trying to be a family in the backwoods environment. Crystal meth was always out there. I was never at any crystal meth parties or anything like that, but there were always people where I lived outside of Houston.

There is so much out there. People on meth like to talk about it. They like to take about the process of making it, the problems they have with it. There are tons of blogs out there, websites, people write songs and poetry about it [laughs]. Not in a good way necessarily, or a glorifying way, but just how it‚Äôs affected there lives. There‚Äôs recipes out there, you don‚Äôt just have to make it one way. There‚Äôs a bunch of different ways to do it.

She was built for Cyrus Curtiss of the Curtis Publishing Company by Cramp Ship and Iron Works, Philadelphia, in 1920 at a cost of two million dollars. She was christened the Motor Yacht Lyndonia. __TOC__ In Pan American Aviation Company service In 1939, Pan American Aviation Company bought Lyndonia and changed her name to MV Southern Seas. She was used in the South Pacific by Pan American to supplement their passenger service. In United States service  When the United States entered World War II in December 1941, the ship was sold by Pan American to the Army Corps of Engineers for $600,000. The US Army used her in the South Pacific to transport troops and also to chart islands and locate air fields. While she was doing this work for the Army, the ship hit an uncharted reef on July 22, 1942 in the vicinity of New Caledonia. As a result of this mishap the Southern Seas had both engine rooms flooded and various holes in the hull. After the collision, the US Navy salvaged Southern Seas and towed her from New Caledonia to New Zealand, where she was docked while the holes in the hull were patched and repairs were made on the main engines. The home port and navy yard of the Southern Seas was Pearl Harbor, but she had never been there due to her extended operations in the forward areas. When the ship was first commissioned, Commander South Pacific Fleet, who at that time was Admiral Halsey, considered the possibility of using her as his flagship; however, he decided against it, and from that time on Southern Seas was used as barracks ship for transient officers and enlisted men. On 12 January 1943, Southern Seas got underway from Auckland, New Zealand, for Noumea, New Caledonia. The ship remained there until June 1943, when she left for Tarawa, Gilbert Island by the way of Funafuti, Ellice Islands. At Tarawa she again served as s barracks ship and was attached to Commander Aircraft Pacific Fleet at this time. In February 1944, the Southern Seas departed for Kwajalein Island by the way of Makin, where she again assumed the duties of a barracks ship. On 25 June 1944, Southern Seas departed from Kwajalein en route to Eniwetok, Marshall Islands in company with SS Pacific Sun and USS YMS-388, where she arrived on 27 June 1944. On 8 August 1944, Southern Seas was ordered to Saipan, Marianas Islands, where she again served as a barracks ship in the forward area. The ship remained at Saipan until 1 January 1945, when she departed for Guam, Marianas Islands. At Guam, the ship was attached to Commander Submarines Pacific Fleet and was moored alongside . On 7 September 1945, Southern Seas was ordered to Okinawa to work directly under Rear Admiral J. D. Price, U3 Navy, who was Commander Naval Operating Base, Okinawa. Southern Seas arrived in Okinawa on 15 September 1945 just in time for Typhoon Louise. She was sunk on 9 October 1945 with a loss of thirteen lives out of a complement of five officers and forty-seven men. During the time that Southern Seas served as barracks ship, accommodating officials of the United States Government and newspaper correspondents, she compiled an impressive guest list including two vice admirals, thirty rear admirals, fifty-three captains, one lieutenant general, four major generals, six brigadier generals, forty-five newspaper correspondents, the Honorable Mr. Nash, New Zealand Minister to the United States, and Mr. Warren Atherton, National Commander of the American Legion.Bureau of Naval Personnel, December 28, 1945, William A.

The exact date of establishment of the party is unknown, while its main newspaper \\"Trudovaya mysl\\" declared for its appearance for the first time in February‚ÄìMarch 1918. Unlike Borotbists, the Ukrainian Party of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries was created out of its Russian counterpart the Left SRs long after the revolution and after the occupation of Ukraine by the Russian Red Guards forces. Program * Organization of the Soviet power in region * Call for the 2nd All-Ukrainian Congress of Soviets * Free federative union with the Soviet Russia * Conducting social reforms such as socialization of land Historical background Soon after its establishment the party members emigrated to Moscow due to occupation of Ukraine by the armed forces of Central Powers. In June 1918 the party returned to Odessa for an underground resistance. The main interests of the party were terrorists actions against the regime of Hetman of Ukraine, creation of the party's insurgent squads, revolutionary committees, and cooperation with the Bolsheviks in the so-called \\"The Nine\\". The party was proud in organization of the Hermann von Eichhorn's assassination along with its Russian counterparts. Beside that action the party was preparing assassination of the Hetman, Minister of Land Affairs, and other German and Austrian generals. The 1st Party Congress that took place in September 1918 has officially separated the Ukrainian party from the Russian Left SRs. Other Ukrainian political parties for a long time did not realize in existence of the party. Individual terror against the government officials and representatives of the German command they viewed as unacceptable and non-allowable form of fighting. Therefore, all Ukrainian political parties reacted sharply negatively to killing Eichhorn. Even the Ukrainian press wrote about the incident as the action of Russian SRs alone. Boris Donskoy commemoration was promoted by Borbysts as a decisive moment in downing of the Hetman regime. The party was organizing its own peasant insurgent squads and created its own Military=Revolutionary Headquarters announcing a major uprising on October 15, 1918. However with the start of the Ukrainian Civil War the party's forces joined the Ukrainian uprising forces, but were instructed to turn the uprising from \\"pro-Petliura\\" to \\"anti-Petliura\\".

A barber living and working in Bristol, Stephens started performing stunts to support his family, which included his wife, Annie, and their 11 children. Charles moved to Ferndale in the Rhondda Valleys where he worked as a barber. After calling the stunt a \\"cool commercial proposition\\", Stephens went over the Horseshoe Falls in an oak barrel, using an anvil for ballast; this proved to be fatal.

DeLaby was assigned to the Belles in March 1949, but being a high school teacher in Fox Lake, Illinois, she did not report until the close of school in the month of June. Then she was released after pitching two innings in an exhibition game against the Kenosha Comets, before returning to her work as a teacher. Afterwards, DeLaby moved to Homosassa, Florida in 1989, where she developed into a dedicated and enthusiastic volunteer for the Florida State Parks Service, beginning at Fort Cooper State Park in Inverness, Florida, while traveling the state encouraging and supporting volunteers. As a result, she contributed with more than 27,000 hours to the park system, becoming the first Florida parks volunteer to surpass the 10,000 volunteer hours mark. In 1992, when Hurricane Andrew hit Florida severely, DeLaby was instrumental in forming the first-ever Friends of Florida State Parks association, and then in 2000, she received the National Volunteer Service Award from the National Recreation and Parks Association.Homosassa Springs volunteer gains national notice.

He represented sulphur interests in Texas. Early life As a boy, he worked as a soda jerk and had three newspaper routes in Houston, until he finished high school as valedictorian at age 15. He attended University of Chicago on a scholarship, waited tables, and tutored other students. He was among six lower division students to win a University Prize for excellence in declamation (summer, 1901) and took part in the Freshman Sophomore debate on whether England was right in the Second Boer War (March 15, 1902). He finished his four-year curriculum in three years. After college, he was a reporter (and railroad editor) at the Houston Post. From about 1905 he was an advertising and immigration agent for Kleberg's St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway. In that capacity, he ran special trains every other week to promote the sale of farm land along the railroad. From 1907 to 1911 he ran another Kleberg business, The Caller, as its editor. Civic booster Roy Miller was elected mayor of Corpus Christi at age 29. During his term of office (1913-1919) the city made major improvements in water supply and paving roads. Not long after his unsuccessful bid for reelection, Miller headed the relief committee after the 1919 hurricane struck Corpus Christi. His lobbying efforts, aided by his friendship with U.S. Representative John Nance Garner, led to Corpus Christi's designation as a deep water port and federal appropriations to build the port. Lobbyist He was renowned in Austin as a lobbyist who supplied members of the Texas State Legislature with bourbon, beefsteak, and blondes. In Washington, he had a reserved table in the House Restaurant where members could eat at his expense. He was a successful lobbyist in New Deal Washington, though he was privately contemptuous of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his policies. Among the Miller group were Representative Martin Dies, Jr., Rep. Richard M. Kleberg, GE lobbyist Horatio H. \\"Rasch\\" Adams, Rep. Nat Patton, James P. Buchanan, and Rep. Hatton W. Sumners. He enjoyed carte blanche access to Rep. Kleberg's office on Capitol Hill. When Kleberg opposed the \\"socialistic\\" and \\"radical\\" 1933 Agricultural Adjustment Administration bill, Miller and Lyndon Johnson persuaded him to vote yes because it was politically expedient. He represented Texas Gulf Sulphur, a company that needed deep harbors on the Gulf Coast. He was personally close to Joseph J. Mansfield, Chairman of the House Committee on Rivers and Harbors.

Consisting mainly of translations into English of magazine and news articles originally published in Japanese, Japan Echo was launched with the support of Japan's Foreign Affairs Ministry \\"to enable people abroad to learn what the Japanese themselves are thinking and writing about the issues of the day.\\"Takeshi Mochida, \\"Japan Echo: A Journal of Opinion to Bridge the Communication Gap,\\" The Japan Foundation Newsletter, August‚ÄìSeptember 1978, 28. Though independently published, the Japanese government provided most of Japan Echo's funding for the duration of its existence. In 2010 budget cuts compelled the magazine to rebrand itself as Japan Echo Web, a purely online magazine published on a website operated by the Foreign Affairs Ministry. However, two years later the Japanese government shut it down and replaced it with a similar project called the Japan Foreign Policy Forum. Origin and content Japan Echo was the brainchild of Kazutoshi Hasegawa, an employee at the Overseas Public Relations Division of the Japanese Foreign Affairs Ministry, who was disturbed by what he perceived to be misinformation and misunderstandings about Japan printed in the foreign press.Kazutoshi Hasegawa, \\"In Memoriam: Seki Yoshihiko,\\" Japan Echo, October 2006, 59-60. Hasegawa recruited Yoshihiko Seki, a social scientist teaching at Tokyo Metropolitan University, to be the first editor of the new journal, which was to be published independently by a new company called Japan Echo Inc. founded in June 1974 by Jiji Press reporter Takeshi Mochida.Joji Harano, \\"From the Publisher: The Final Issue of Japan Echo,\\" Japan Echo, April 2010, 68. Most of Japan Echo's contents were translations, sometimes abridged, of Japanese language essays.Bill Katz and Linda Sternberg Katz, Magazines For Libraries: For the General Reader and School, Junior College, College, University and Public Libraries (New Providence, New Jersey: Bowker, 1997), 178. For each issue the journal's editors selected what they considered the best articles published in major Japanese magazines on topics which were of Japanese or international significance at that time. For instance the first issue of November 1974 included eighteen articles from periodicals including Ch≈´≈çk≈çron, Shokun!, Jiy≈´, Sh≈´kan Gendai, Bungeishunj≈´, and Seiron grouped into topics like the oil crisis, the Solzhenitsyn case, Japanese relations with southeast Asia where Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka's state visits had been greeted by mass protests, and the case of Lieutenant Hiroo Onoda.\\"Contents,\\" Japan Echo, November 1974, 3. The editors of Japan Echo said that they desired to \\"faithfully reflect a spectrum of responsible and informed Japanese opinion\\", though most of its editors were considered to be politically right-of- center.Hiroshi Fujita, \\"English-Language Periodicals In Japan,\\" Japan Quarterly, July‚ÄìSeptember 1994, 302-304. Japan Echo was at first released on a quarterly basis, but switched to a bimonthly format from 1997 and onward.Takashi Shiraishi, \\"From the Editor,\\" Japan Echo, April 2010, 2-4. It also had a French language edition which existed from 1979 and 2009 and a Spanish language edition from 1988 to 2009. Sumiko Iwao, a member of the editorial board from 1985 until 2007, also served as the magazine's editor-in- chief from 1997 until her retirement in 2007. Sources of funding and support At the magazine's founding the Japanese Foreign Affairs Ministry promised Japan Echo Inc. CEO Takeshi Mochida that it would not interfere with the selection of articles, but even so Japan Echo was always highly reliant on support from the Japanese government. Throughout the journal's existence the Japanese government bought 70 percent of its print run, amounting to 50,000 copies annually, and distributing it free of charge to its embassies and consulates and then in turn to universities, libraries, and researchers. The Economist magazine concluded that the Foreign Affairs Ministry continued to sponsor Japan Echo because it presented \\"a view of the country that the Japanese government likes the world to see.\\"\\"Sweet Fruits, Sour Thoughts,\\" The Economist, August 29, 1981, 39. However, Japan Echo magazine also earned revenue from other sources including private subscriptions, bulk sales to Toyota Motors and Japan Airlines, and from the independent translation services provided by Japan Echo Inc.Peter McGill, \\"Japan's War Role Defended Anew,\\" The Globe and Mail, March 20, 198, 15. Praise and criticism The reference book, Magazines for Libraries described Japan Echo as an \\"excellent quarterly\\" which was \\"particularly valuable because it presents the Japanese in their own terms, unmediated by foreign 'experts'.\\" \\"Controversial topics\\", the book noted, \\"are not avoided.\\" Japan Echo was also praised by Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau for its quality and readability. Its 1987 special edition on Tokyo was described by a The Japan Times columnist as \\"one of the best pieces ever done\\" on the subject and its coverage of the controversy over the Nanking Massacre was endorsed by the newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun for its \\"focus on facts, rather than getting caught up in emotional bluster.\\"\\"Book Takes Coolheaded Look At Nanjing Incident,\\" Yomiuri Shimbun, April 12, 2008, 3. Many scholars supported the magazine including Hugh Cortazzi, although he also condemned one issue from 2006 which reprinted an interview between Sh≈çichi Watanabe and Tar≈ç As≈ç in which Watanabe denied the Nanking Massacre and advocated Japanese exceptionalism. In the same vein The Globe and Mail was highly critical of a 1984 issue in which a series of authors seemed to be watering down Japan's responsibility for World War II by arguing that \\"Japan, simply to assure its own survival, was given little choice but to wage war with the United States.\\" Roy Andrew Miller's book Japan's Modern Myth includes an extended criticism of Japan Echo, which he accuses of being a \\"public-relations organ\\" promoting the same discredited ideas of Japanese linguistic and cultural uniqueness found in the Kokutai no Hongi.Roy Andrew Miller, Japan's Modern Myth: The Language And Beyond (New York: Weatherhill, 1982), 18, 140‚Äì142. End of the print magazine To deal with Japan's mounting fiscal deficits, the newly elected government of Yukio Hatoyama formed the Government Revitalization Unit in 2009 to look for areas where the budget could be trimmed. The Unit recommended that the government cease purchasing and distributing foreign language periodicals like Japan Echo. The government initially followed through with this recommendation but the move was widely disapproved of by scholars of Japanese affairs including Cortazzi and thanks in part to their protests the Foreign Affairs Ministry eventually agreed to revive Japan Echo as an online magazine, which would be produced on an annual basis by whichever company put forward the best bid. Japan Echo Web Japan Echo Inc. won the first competitive bid to publish Japan Echo Web in 2010. The new online magazine would be released bimonthly in English and Chinese on a website owned by the Japanese Foreign Affairs Ministry, though as before the editors of Japan Echo Inc. had the final say over its contents \\"in order to keep the publication from being government propaganda.\\" The launch of the new magazine was praised in the journal Asian Politics & Policy for eschewing propaganda and providing \\"up-to-date, reliable information on current events\\".Daniel P. Aldrich, \\"Japan Echo Web,\\" Asian Politics & Policy, July 2011, 489‚Äì490. In 2011 Japan Echo Inc. concluded that annual bidding for its status as publisher of Japan Echo Web was \\"not a sustainable business model\\" and broke with the Japanese government after 37 years of cooperation. Japan Echo Inc. became the Nippon Communications Foundation which today has its own online magazine Nippon.com \\"driven by the same spirit that inspired the journal Japan Echo\\". A new group called The Japan Journal took over the magazine for the next fiscal year, after which the government terminated the Japan Echo brand for good and replaced it on November 26, 2012 with an official successor called Japan Foreign Policy Forum.

However, this often comes at the cost of environmentally unsound practices. Developing nations with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent environmental regulations, and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards. Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest environmental standards or weakest enforcement. Three scales of the hypothesis #Pollution control costs have an impact at the margins, where they exert some effect on investment decisions and trade flows. #Pollution control costs are important enough to measurably influence trade and investment. #Countries set their environmental standards below socially- efficient levels in order to attract investment or to promote their exports. Scales 1 and 2 have empirical support, but the significance of the hypothesis relative to other investment and trade factors is still controversial. One study found that environmental regulations have a strong negative effect on a country's FDI, particularly in pollution-intensive industries when measured by employment. However, that same study found that the environmental regulations present in a country's neighbors have an insignificant impact on that country's trade flows. Formula and variations :Yi = Œ±Ri + XiŒ≤I + Œµi In the above formula, Y is economic activity, R is regulatory stringency, X is an aggregate of other characteristics that affect Y and Œµ is an error term. Theoretically, by changing your value of R, analysts will be able to calculate the expected effect on economic activity. According to the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, this equation shows that environmental regulations and economic activity are negatively correlated, because regulations raise the cost of key inputs to goods with pollution-intensive productions and reduce jurisdictions' comparative advantage in these goods. This lack of comparative advantage causes firms to move to countries with lower environmental standards, decreasing Y. There is also an expanded formula, as shown below: :Yit = vi + Œ±Rit + Œ≥Tit + Œ∏RitTit + X‚ÄôŒ≤it + Œµit This expanded formula takes into account whether trade liberalization (i.e. the level of trade barriers that exist in a country, labeled as T) increases the negative correlation between economic activity (Y) and regulatory stringency (R). Some authors claim that trade barriers disproportionately effect the environment, and this equation attempts to quantify the interaction between trade barriers and regulatory stringency, and the corresponding effect with respect to output in an economy.  Connection with the environmental Kuznets curve  A simple recreation of the Environmental Kuznets Curve, made using Microsoft Excel. The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) is a conceptual model that suggests that a country's pollution concentrations rise with development and industrialization up to a turning point, after which they fall again as the country uses its increased affluence to reduce pollution concentrations, suggesting that the cleaner environment in developed countries comes at the expense of a dirtier environment in developing countries. In this sense, the EKC is potentially a reflection of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, because one of the factors that may drive the increase in environmental degradation seen in pre-industrial economies is an influx of waste from post-industrial economies. This same transfer of polluting firms through trade and foreign investment could lead to the decrease in environmental degradation seen in downward-sloping section of the EKC, which models post-industrial (service) economies. This model holds true in cases of national development, but cannot necessarily be applied at a local scale. Real-world example Spent batteries that Americans turn in to be recycled are increasingly being sent to Mexico, where the lead inside them is extracted by crude methods that are illegal in the United States. This increased export flow is a result of strict new Environmental Protection Agency standards on lead pollution, which make domestic recycling more difficult and expensive in the United States, but do not prohibit companies from exporting the work and danger to countries where environmental standards are low and enforcement is lax. In this sense, Mexico is becoming a pollution haven for the United States battery industry because Mexican environmental officials acknowledge that they lack the money, manpower, and technical capacity to police the flow. According to The New York Times in 2011, 20% of spent American vehicle and industrial batteries were being exported to Mexico, up from 6% in 2007, meaning that approximately 20 million batteries would cross the border that year. A significant proportion of this flow was being smuggled in after being mislabeled as metal scrap. e-waste dump sites added in 2013. The world map shown here illustrates how e-waste dump sites (or sites where citizens or multinational corporations of industrialized nations dump their used electronic devices) along with the GDP PPP per-capita of those countries.Shows an estimated amount of Used EEE and E-Waste imported into Kyoto Protocol Non-Annex 1 countries, with the E-Waste generated by each country's own domestic supplies. While GDP PPP per-capita is not a perfect indicator of economic development, and e-waste dump sites are only one small facet of what could be a greater pollution haven, this map does illustrate how e-waste dump sites are often located in poorer, relatively pre-industrial nations, which provides some rudimentary support for the Pollution Haven Hypothesis. Areas of controversy  The first area of controversy with respect to the Pollution Haven Theory has to do with the formulas above. Finding an appropriate measure of regulatory stringency (R) is not simple, because we want to know how much more costly production is in a given jurisdiction relative to others due to that jurisdiction's environmental regulations. The compliance costs stemming from these regulations, however, could come in the form of environmental taxes, regulatory delays, the threat or execution of lawsuits, product redesign, or emissions limits. This proliferation of cost styles makes R hard to quantify. Another major critique of the second formula is that it is difficult to measure regulatory stringency and trade barriers because the two effects are likely endogenous, so few studies have attempted to estimate the indirect effect of trade liberalization on pollution havens. Furthermore, governments at times engage in inefficient competition to actually attract polluting industries through weakening their environmental standards. However, as per conventional economic theory, welfare-maximizing governments should set standards so that the benefits justify the costs at the margin. This does not mean that environmental standards will be equal everywhere, as jurisdictions have different assimilative capacities, costs of abatement, and social attitudes regarding the environment, meaning heterogeneity in pollution standards is to be expected. By extension, this means that industry migration to less stringent jurisdictions may not raise efficiency concerns in an economic sense. A final area of controversy is whether the Pollution Haven Hypothesis has empirical support. For example, studies have found statistically significant evidence that countries with poor air quality do have higher net factor exports of coal, but the magnitude of the impact is small relative to other variables. Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning economist, is skeptical as to whether pollution havens have empirical support in economic theory, as he writes, \\"At this point it's hard to come up with major examples of industries in which the pollution haven phenomenon, to the extent that it occurs, leads to international negative externalities. This does not, however, say that such examples cannot arise in the future.\\" Scale 3 above has had empirical arguments made specifically against it, especially in the last 20 years. Some economists argue that once higher environmental standards are introduced in a country, larger multinational firms present in the country are likely to push for enforcement so as to reduce the cost advantage of smaller local firms. This effect would make countries with strict environmental standards a haven for the large companies often associated with higher levels of pollution, meaning the polluting agents may be smaller companies, rather than the larger MNCs as theorized by other proponents of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis.

Ottumwa teams played as emebers of the Illinois-Iowa League (1890‚Äì1891), Eastern Iowa League (1895), Western Association (1898‚Äì1899), Iowa State League (1904‚Äì1907), Central Association (1908‚Äì1912, 1913‚Äì1914, 1916) and Mississippi Valley League (1922‚Äì1928). Baseball Hall of Fame member Burleigh Grimes played for the 1913 Ottumwa Packers. History History of the nickname Ottumwa was host to multiple minor league teams using a few different names, with the first known squad appearing in 1890 and the last playing in 1928. The Packers nickname, which first appeared in 1907, was the most commonly used. It was initially used through the 1910 season, when the team changed its name to the Speedboys for 1911 and 1912. It resumed use of the Packers nickname in 1913, using it until the team moved to Rock Island, Illinois to become the Rock Island Islanders partway through the 1914 season. 1915 was the first season since 1900 that Ottumwa did not field a professional team and the first since 1912 that a team called the Packers did not play. However, in the middle of the 1916 season, the Burlington Pathfinders moved to Ottumwa, and the Packers name was once again put into use. The team did not last long, folding following the season. Minor league baseball returned to Ottumwa in 1922, with the Packers nickname returning in 1926. It was used through 1928, when the last professional team to date was fielded in the city. League championships The Ottumwa Coal Palaces won the Illinois-Iowa League championship in 1890 under Manager Stancliffe. Ottumwa finished 63‚Äì43 in the eight‚Äìteam league, 4.5 games ahead of the 2nd place Monmouth Maple Cities. The Ottumwa Snappers won back-to-back Iowa State League Championships in 1904 and 1905, both under namesake Manager Snapper Kennedy. Ottuwa finished 70‚Äì36 in 1904, 6.5 games ahead of the 2nd place Waterloo Microbes. In 1905, the Snappers finished the season with a 74‚Äì45 record, 2.5 games ahead of the Fort Dodge Gypsumites in the eight‚Äìteam league. In 1911 and 1912, the Ottumwa Speedboys won back-to- back Central Association Championships, both under Manager Ned Egan, who led the team to a third consecutive championship in 1913, when they played at the Ottumwa Packers. The Speedboys finished 87‚Äì41 in 1911, 4.5 games ahead of the 2nd place Burlington Pathfinders. Ottumwa repeated as champions in 1912, finishing 79‚Äì50, 3.0 games ahead of the Kewanee Boilermakers. The Ottumwa Packers won the 1913 championship, their third consecutive Central Association Championship under manager Ned Egan. Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Burleigh Grimes pitched for the 1913 Packers, where he had a 6‚Äì2 record with a 1.93 ERA at age 19. The 1926 Packers won the Mississippi Valley League Championship under manager Pat Harkins. In neither year was a league championship series played, however the Packers finished in first both seasons, making them champions. The ballpark From 1890 to 1899, Ottumwa teams played at Green Street Park. Green Street Park was possibly located at Myrtle & Green Streets, Ottumwa, Iowa. Beginning in 1904, Ottumwa teams played at Riverside Park. The ballpark was located on South Wapello Street in the park district.

They were created by the ordonnance of Montil-l√®s-Tours on 28 April 1448, which prescribed that in each parish an archer should be chosen from among the most apt in the use of arms; who was to be exempt from the taille and certain obligations, to practise shooting with the bow on Sundays and feast-days, and to hold himself ready to march fully equipped at the first signal. Under Charles VII the francs-archers distinguished themselves in numerous battles with the English, and assisted the king in driving them from France. The Francs-archers deficient combat performance, indiscipline and unreliability led Louis XI in 1480 to train a professional army under Marshal Philippe de Cr√®vec≈ìur d'Esquerdes and abolish the militia a year later, ordering their equipment to be put in store in the parishes. The cost of this permanent force was too great for the kingdom's finances, with the standing army being disbanded in 1483‚Äì1484 after Louis XI's death. In 1485 the franc-archer system was re-established and they were employed again in the Flanders campaign of the Mad War under Esquerdes. During the Italian Wars, the francs-archers were primarily used for frontier defense. In May 1513 Louis XII raised 22,000 of them for such a purpose. They occasionally served in the field during campaigns such as in 1522 and 1523. They were levied for the last time after the French defeat at Pavia. The francs-archers were definitively disbanded in 1535.Arthur Augustus Tilley, Medieval France: A Companion to French Studies, Volume 5 (CUP Archive, 1964), pp. 159-61. Recruitment and composition A Franc-archer was recruited in every parish of France. The parish was obligated to choose an archer and supply him with the specified equipment. The archer would train himself on feast-days and holidays. They were free from all taxes (hence the name) and were paid four francs for every month of service. The Francs-archers were predominantly older men, with the average age being 32. They often had to be re-equipped after service, breeding resentment among the villagers. They would also misuse their position to oppress the peasantry, while pretending to be simply obeying the king's will. Organization and equipment During the Hundred Years' War the francs-archers fought in companies of 200‚Äì300 men. The companies were led by nobles and were later put under the command of 4 captains-general. The 1448 ordonnance specified the equipment of the archer as a sallet helmet, dagger, sword, a bow, a sheath of arrows, a jerkin and a coat of mail. In 1466 they used the pike for the first time and by the late 1470s some companies were employing Swiss-style pikemen. During the Mad War in 1488, Esquerdes took 12,000 francs-archers for his campaign in Flanders. In 1513, the 22,000-strong francs-archers levy was raised for 18 months and was organised into 44 ensigns of 500 men, each led by five centeniers. In 1510 Machiavelli noted that each franc-archer was required to have a horse. The Decree of 17 January 1522 listed the updated equipment of the franc-archer as comprising a corselet, a mail gorget, arm-pieces, a mail skirt and a helmet. Two-thirds were to be pikemen and the rest would be armed with halberds, crossbows and arquebuses. Service The Francs-archers were primarily used for frontier defense against foreign enemies and against bandits in the interior such as the aventuriers. They were also used in field battles, though their combat effectiveness against professional troops was low, such as against the Germans at Guinegate. In addition, they were prone to desertion, treason and capitulation. During the reign of Louis XI the francs-archers performed poorly at the battle of Guinegate while under the command of Marshal Joachim Rouault. Lacking any unit training or discipline, they lost 6,000 men killed in action and many of them looted the enemy camp instead of fighting.  Franc-archers in literature The franc-archers was a stock figure of fun in literary satire as early as the late 15th century. In these satires the franc-archer is portrayed as vainglorious, cowardly and militarily useless. Fran√ßois Rabelais mocked the francs-archers as cowards in his 1542 edition of Pantagruel.

NEHTA‚Äôs five strategic priorities that define their role in adoption and implementation are: # Deliver, operationalise and enhance the essential foundations required. # Coordinate the progression of priority eHealth initiatives. # Manage the delivery of key components of DOHA‚Äôs PCEHR Programme. # Accelerate national adoption of eHealth. # Lead the further progression of eHealth in Australia.  Supporting the Australian Health System  NEHTA aims to develop Health Care in Australia by adopting eHealth systems. Electronic health information (or eHealth) systems‚Äô ability to securely and efficiently exchange data can drastically improve the ways in which clinical and administrative information is communicated between healthcare professionals. In delivering this, NETHA will support the Australian health system by: * Improving the quality of healthcare services, by enabling authorized clinicians to access a patient‚Äôs integrated healthcare information and history, sourced directly from clinical notes, test results and prescriptions using standardized clinical data formats and terminologies. * Streamlining multi-disciplinary care management, enabling seamless handovers of care by ensuring efficient electronic referrals; authorised access to up-to-date clinical opinions and patient healthcare histories via shared patient health records; and fast, secure mechanisms for directly exchanging important notifications between healthcare providers. * Improving clinical and administrative efficiency, by standardising certain types of healthcare information to be recorded in eHealth systems; uniquely identifying patients, healthcare providers and medical products; and reforming the purchasing process for medical products. * Maintaining high standards of patient privacy and information security. Infrastructure NEHTA is leading a national approach to eHealth to support private, national, state, and territory reforms by developing a national e-health infrastructure to enable connected health today, and the future. NEHTA turned on the eHealth record system on 1 July 2012. This included laying the foundations and developing eHealth solutions, such as Healthcare Identifiers, the Australian Medicines Terminology, SNOMED CT, and Secure Messaging. Australia is the first country to have assembled such a large scale, integrated piece of national infrastructure. Security A critical aspect in electronically coordinating patient care across the healthcare sector is to ensure that healthcare information can be securely accessed and shared amongst healthcare providers, when and where it is required. To ensure the security of patient information NEHTA has created the National eHealth Security and Access Framework. The National eHealth Security and Access Framework have been developed as a control mechanism to ‚Äòincrease certainty that health information is created and accessed in a secure and trustworthy manner‚Äô. It aims to ensure: * Access to consumer health information is consistently controlled and monitored as it transitions through independent organisations, business processes and systems in the Australian Health Sector. * The provenance of all electronic health information is traceable from its creation at a verifiable trusted source through its transition and possible augmentation en route to its destination. Privacy Privacy is a key priority of NEHTA in leading the widespread adoption of eHealth in Australia. Privacy compliance is a fundamental principle for NEHTA, both in terms of meeting legal obligations and community expectations. NEHTA has developed a privacy management framework that aims to ensure that privacy considerations are integrated into the design, management and policies created with eHealth initiatives across NEHTA. In the media  17 May 2013  On 17 May 2013 The National E-Health Transition Authority (NEHTA) was successful in an eHealth trial of secure messaging. NEHTA claims that Australian healthcare professionals will soon be able to share clinical information through online messaging. The trial included five healthcare messaging vendors: Argus Connect, Global Health, Healthlink, LRS Health and Medical Objects. The vendors successfully sent and received secure messages from each other, showing the interoperability of the messaging system. :The progress that has been achieved by this Project will mean any medical practitioner ‚Äì be they a public or private GP, specialist or surgeon ‚Äì will be able to share information over time through online secure messaging ... We can see that this technology is available, it does work and all healthcare providers will have the ability over time to connect across a wide range of clinical information systems. It will increase electronic clinical information exchange between healthcare professionals, decrease the use of paper based communication and importantly provide more timely and accurate patient health information. \\\\- Dr Mukesh Haikerwal (Head of Clinical Leadership and Stakeholder Management.

The building underwent extensive renovation and expansion between 1899 and 1901 and again in 2000, when it was co-owned by Terence Conran. Hyatt has owned the hotel since 2006, operating it under the Andaz brand. Our 5 Star Boutique Hotel in London Andaz Hotels; accessed 2013.04.18. The hotel has been listed Grade II on the National Heritage List for England since March 1993. History The Victorian building that houses the hotel is built on the site of England‚Äôs first hospital for the mentally ill, the Bethlehem Royal Hospital, which opened in 1247 and became known as ‚ÄòBedlam‚Äô. Before a major refurbishment of the hotel in the 1990s, a plaque mentioning this historical reference was visible near the main entrance. The hotel was designed by the brothers Charles Barry, Jr. and Edward Middleton Barry. An additional section, the Abercorn Rooms, was added a decade later by Robert William Edis. The hotel's clientele included business people who could avoid City traffic by staying near the railway station. By 1908 the hotel was operating as the Liverpool Street Hotel and produced postcards advertising its proximity to the London Underground. A daily supply of fresh sea water for bathing was brought in by train. The building is notable also for its inclusion of two Masonic Temples‚Äîan Egyptian temple in the basement and a Grecian temple on the first floor. Caledonian Lodge No 134, an English lodge for Scottish Masons in London, met at the Great Eastern from 1920 to 1947. By the second half of the twentieth century the hotel was due for refurbishment and, following the redesign and improvement of the railway station in the 1980s, it was expected that an investor would be found to accomplish a similar task with the adjacent hotel. The Manser Practice, which had already achieved success with the planning and construction of a Hilton Hotels & Resorts brand hotel on the south side of London Heathrow Airport, was awarded the refurbishment contract in 1996. A new lobby was created by removing several existing guest rooms, and the capacity was increased to 267 rooms by reusing attic space. The Manser design was informed by the practice of daylighting, realised by providing lightwells in the ceiling of the lobby and in the main dining room and by providing as many views of London as possible in the bedrooms. Since 2006 the hotel has been owned by Hyatt, which operates it as Andaz London Liverpool Street, a 5 star lifestyle hotel. Facilities The building (including the Abercorn Rooms) is of red brick with stucco and stone ground floor and mildly classical style dressings. Of the 267 rooms, 15 are suites. Seven bars and restaurants are available on property, as well as a fitness center and steam room. In literature The Great Eastern is where vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing stays during his first visit to London in Bram Stoker's Gothic fiction horror novel Dracula. The narrator of W. G. Sebald's Austerlitz meets the titular character in the bar of the Great Eastern after a twenty year separation; Austerlitz recounts details of the building including the Grecian temple.

The two hit it off immediately and became close friends. After returning to Japan, Mikawa asked Kiuchi to design a house for him as proof of their friendship, and the result is what is now known in English as Mikawa House.

History 189x189px The Dwarf Hotot is one of the more recent breeds to be recognized by the ARBA, gaining acceptance in 1983. It has never been without a strong following, but also has never been among the most popular breeds. There's an unusual story behind this breed's development. The much larger Blanc de Hotot was produced in the early 1900s in an effort to produce a black-eyed white rabbit for meat and fur. In that era, large rabbits were valued for their commercial value. But in later years, big bunnies went out of style and people started pursuing dwarf breeds. In the 1970s, one breeder in East Germany and one in West Germany started working on a Dwarf Hotot, completely independent of one another. One crossed a REW Netherland Dwarf to a Blanc de Hotot; the other didn't use a standard Hotot at all, but crossed a black Netherland Dwarf to a Dutch and bred out markings until only the eyebands remained. The two strains were eventually united to produce the breed we know today. This ‚Äúeye of the fancy‚Äù is of compact type and has a gentle rollback coat. Unlike the Polish, which as similar body type, the shoulders are supposed to be as wide as the hips, and not show any taper. The head set is not as high on the shoulders as that of a Netherland Dwarf, but should not rest on the table either. The head is bold and broad. Ears are carried in an upright V shape, and are disqualified if over 2 ¬æ inches in length. The eyes are encircled with narrow bands of colored fur. Ideal eyeband width equals the thickness of two pennies, and the bands of color are even all around the eye. Weak or streaky eyebands are faulted, but a complete break in the band is disqualified. For many years, the only accepted variety was white with black eyebands. In the year 2006, chocolate banded Dwarf Hotots were accepted by the ARBA. The black and chocolate banded bunnies are shown together, but the color must be specified on the registration forms. Blue-band Dwarf Hotots have also been in development, and are currently in the process of being accepted by the ARBA. The Dwarf Hotot is strictly a fancy breed. At 3 pounds max, they are too small to be of commercial value. Temperaments can range from outgoing to moody, but as a rule they are friendly rabbits and well suited to a pet life.

He was killed in action near Jerusalem during the latter. Early life Al-'As was born to a family of modest financial means in Hama, central Syria,Provence 2005, p. 40. in 1889.Quilliam, 1999, p. 89. He graduated from the Ottoman Military School in Damascus and later the Ottoman Military College (Maktab Harbiye) in Istanbul. Ottoman rule in Syria ended in 1918 with their defeat by British and Sharifian forces in World War I. Following the war, al-'As was among the group of former Ottoman officers who allied with the Sharifian commander Emir Faisal. Faisal served as king of the Kingdom of Syria until 1920, when the kingdom was dissolved by French forces after they defeated Faisal's army in the Battle of Maysalun. Al-'As participated in that battle. Afterward, the French Mandate of Syria was established.Provence 2005, pp. 45‚Äì46. Al-'As then left for Amman in the Emirate of Transjordan, where he lived in exile.Provence 2011, p. 220. Role in the Great Syrian Revolt In the mid-summer of 1925, after three prominent Druze leaders were invited to Damascus by the French authorities, only to be arrested and imprisoned, Sultan Pasha al-Atrash rallied his Druze warriors in Jabal al-Arab and declared a revolt against French rule in Syria. After scoring a number of victories against the French Army, al-Atrash's rebellion inspired Syrian nationalists throughout the country to take up arms and the uprising spread throughout the country. A meeting of exiled rebel leaders in Wadi al-Sirhan in Saudi Arabia, October 1929. Sultan Pasha al- Atrash is seated in the middle of the bottom row, and al-'As is seated second to his right Al-'As became a prominent leader of the rebellion, moving between the Ghouta countryside of Damascus and the Jabal in the Hauran. In a 26 November meeting of rebel leaders in Saqba, a village near Damascus, al-'As was chosen as the general leader of the rebellion. His position was reconfirmed in another meeting of the rebel leadership in Saqba on 5 December. In the latter meeting al-'As contested the leadership of his rival Nasib al- Bakri. Al-Bakri's closest rebel ally, Hasan al-Kharrat, had detained an important rebel leader from Deir ez-Zor, Ramadan al-Shallash, and along with al-Bakri, accused him of levying illegitimate taxes against villages to enrich himself. Although several officers disapproved of al-Kharrat's procedures against al-Shallash, a judgement was made expelling al-Shallash from the rebellion. Before the judgement could be exercised, French aircraft bombarded Saqba and amid the bombing al-'As had al-Shallash released.Provence, pp. 135‚Äì137. As the revolt came to an end in 1927, al-'As departed from the al- Nabk region where he and other rebel leaders had been recruiting volunteers. Al-'As then headed for Deir ez-Zor, located along the Euphrates River in the Syrian Desert. From there, he and Fawzi al-Qawuqji left for Baghdad in the Kingdom of Iraq, which at the time was under a degree of British military administration. In Iraq he served under King Faisal, who had previously been forced out of Syria in 1920. Together, al-'As and al-Qawuqji helped to train and organize the Royal Iraqi Army.Provence, 2005, pp. 142‚Äì143. Commander in Palestine When the Palestinian Arab revolt against British rule and increased Jewish immigration to Palestine erupted in 1936,Talhami, 2001, p. 18. hundreds of Arab volunteers arrived to support the uprising, including some 200 Syrians, many of whom were inspired by Izz al-Din al-Qassam,Sulaiman, 1984, p. 49. a Syrian guerrilla leader who struggled and died fighting the British in Palestine a year earlier. Al-'As was among them and was one of their two leaders, according to Palestinian historian Basheer M. Nafi. The other commander was Muhammad al-Ashmar.Nafi, p. 227. Al-'As served as the overall commander of Arab fighters in the vicinity of Jerusalem and his second-in-command was Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, a Palestinian commander from a prominent Jerusalemite family.Nafi, 1998, p. 246. Death and legacy Al-'As was killed in a confrontation with British forces in the Jerusalem area on 6 October 1936. Al-Husayni was severely wounded in the clash, which ended his military activities for the remainder of the year. However, he emerged as al-'As's successor in the Jerusalem sector between 1937 and the end of the revolt in 1939. In 1935, al-'As had Safahat min al-ayyam al-hamraa, a collection of his memoirs on the Great Syrian Revolt, published. The book was later republished by his grandson. From the perspective of the Ba'athist governments of Hafez al-Assad and Bashar al-Assad, al-'As's nationalist credentials are relatively strong, but he was not honored like some of the other prominent leaders of the revolt, such as Sultan Pasha al-Atrash or Hasan al-Kharrat. The reason behind this was the posthumous adoption of al-'As as a \\"nationalist saint\\" by the Syrian Social Nationalist Party (SSNP) of Antun Saadeh. The SSNP and the Ba'ath Party had an acrimonious relationship, and the former was banned in Ba'athist-run Syria.Provence, 2005, pp. 180‚Äì181.

It is believed to have been discovered in Alexandria, Egypt at the site of Cleopatra's sunken palace on the island of Antirhodos. The bust was purchased by the ROM's founder Charles Trick Currelly while on expedition in Egypt in the early 20th Century. The Bust of Cleopatra VII can be found on Level 3 of the ROM in the Galleries of Africa: Egypt along with almost 2000 other Egyptian artifacts on display. Identification history 1960s Egyptologist: Bernard Von Bothmer of the Brooklyn Museum, was the first expert to attempt to identify the piece and published his findings in an exhibition catalogue from 1960. On the subject of identification of such statues, Von Bothmer said \\"each sculpture has to be judged by style, rather than by attributes and accoutrements.\\" :*Neckline: Von Bothmer noted that \\"with exceptions, the thin garment indicated by the neckline is more common in early than in late Ptolemaic Sculpture.\\" :*Facial Features: When examining the features of the sculpted face, Von Bothmer was of the opinion \\"the expression is dry, bland, and non-commital.\\" He felt as though \\"there is a mystery in the face, and the puzzling element is probably Hellenistic.\\" Based on closer analysis, he thought that the piece ought to be \\"distinguished from more traditional sculptures of the early Ptolemaic Period.\\" With no other previous scholarly literature available on the sculpture at the time, Von Bothmer concluded that: \\"If the date suggested (about 240-200 BC) is correct, we may have in this queen either Berenice II or Arsinoe III.\\" A close-up picture of the round facial and neckline features of the statue 1980s Robert S. Bianchi, also of the Brooklyn Museum, suggested the bust was either of a Queen or Goddess because \\"the appearance of the uraeus on the hair band is an attribute common to both.\\" Bianchi thought a more precise identification would have been possible \\"had the annulets on the crown of the head been preserved.\\" :*Neckline: Bianchi decided to focus on other sculpted features of the bust \\"for the chronological criteria.\\" He made note of the \\"concave, raised neckline\\" on the statue and compared the features of the neckline with other Ptolemaic statues of women from the Mus√©es royaux d'art et d'histoire in Brussels, Belgium (English: Royal Museums of Art and History) and the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, Connecticut. The statues Bianchi used to compare with the ROM's piece were both dated between 200-100 BC. :*Facial Features: Bianchi also identified the bust's time period using the sculpting style of the facial features. He noted \\"The face is modeled in broad planes without the addition of linear adjuncts, and the treatment of the eyes, with a creased upper lid which passes over the lower, recalls features common to sculptures assigned to 3rd and 2nd centuries BC.\\" With this research, evidence began to suggest that the statue belonging to the ROM had different characteristics when compared with other Ptolemaic statues from the 240-200 BC period. Bianchi's research challenged the first commonly accepted identification of the statue by dating the fragment to between 200 and 100 BC, and by giving merit to the possibility that the statue in fact depicts a goddess. 2000s - present Notice the large back pillar protruding from the back of the sculpture and base of the crown on the top of the head Sally- Ann Ashton of The Fitzwilliam Museum focuses on \\"the unusual extended back pillar with crown and the rounded portrait features, which on closer examination echo but do not exactly match those of early Ptolemaic period\\" in dating the statue. :*Facial Features: While examining the statue's face, Ashton noted \\"in profile, the face appears flat and almost angular, a feature typical of Roman-era copies of Ptolemaic sculpture.\\" She adds, \\"the pronounced modelling around the eyes is typical of Roman-period sculptures and can be found on numerous sphinxes and portraits of the emperor as pharaoh.\\" ::The Roman copying of Ptolemaic sculpting traditions may be due in-part to a policy introduced by Cleopatra VII. As Ashton writes \\"research undertaken for the British Museum's Cleopatra of Egypt exhibition, scholars had discovered Cleopatra VII had a policy of associating herself with Arsinoe II.\\" This policy \\"included copying the sculptures of Arsinoe's day (early Ptolemaic period) who remained a popular goddess into the Roman period.\\" ::In reference to the past attempts at identification based on facial features Ashton remarked, \\"it is not surprising then that some earlier-style features found their way into the Roman-Egyptian repertoire of Cleopatra's time, which also explains why scholars have struggled to place the ROM's piece.\\" :*Back Pillar and Crown: Ashton made a connection between the statue at the ROM and an almost identical piece from the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, University College, London, \\"which shares the unusual pillar and crown, is also linked to the 1st century BC and to Cleopatra herself.\\" ::The back pillar usually \\"extended beyond the statue's head only in colossal statue's to support the headdress.\\" The ROM and the Petrie sculptures were \\"smaller than life-size\\" yet both shared the back pillars defining characteristic. While the piece at the ROM does not have any identifying inscriptions, the sculpture at the Petrie Museum does and reads \\"king's sister and king's wife.\\" The inscription on the Petrie sculpture identifies the piece to be of Cleopatra VII sometime between 46-47 BC. ::The crown of the statue (now broken) provided another link to identifying the statue. \\"In form, the ROM and the Petrie sculptures are the same; both have the crown carved from the same block of stone as the statue's.\\" The differences in the two crowns can be found on the statue's headdress. The ROM's statue has one uraeus (cobra) sculpted into the headdress, while the Petrie piece has three. One cobra was usually indicative of being \\"associated with Arsinoe II\\" a queen we now know Cleopatra VII was synonymous with, through policy. Three cobras was the usual distinction Cleopatra VII would use in motifs. With this in mind, Ashton hypothesized that \\"the ROM statue may thus be a missing link-a very early representation of the queen, at a time before she had adopted the three cobras, perhaps during her early reign with Ptolemy XIII. This would date the statue from 51 to 47 BC. Currently, the artifact label for the Royal Ontario Museum's statue of Cleopatra VII reads as follows: Cultural analysis left Ancient Egyptian Roberta Shaw, Assistant Curator of World Cultures at the Royal Ontario Museum suggest, \\"the statue probably stood outside some important municipal building. Perhaps a temple, perhaps the famous Alexandrian Library.\\" The object's meaning within Ancient Egyptian culture stems from its role as a municipal statue. The small-sized nature demonstrates the statue would have been seen on a daily basis for the late Ptolemaic Egyptians; it would have been displayed at a level where the public could easily identify it as Cleopatra VII. In contrast, the Roman busts of Cleopatra that have survived, including the Berlin Cleopatra in the Altes Museum and the Vatican Cleopatra in the Vatican Museums (excluding the now disputed British Museum bust of Cleopatra thought to be a Roman woman imitating her hairstyle), depict the queen as a Hellenistic Greek monarch with a royal diadem and \\"melon\\" hairstyle of her Ptolemaic Greek ancestors Arsinoe II and Berenice II. A Hellenistic bust in the Archaeological Museum of Cherchel, Algeria again shows Cleopatra wearing the royal diadem, symbol of Greek kingship, but with a different hairstyle than the Berlin and Vatican busts. Another Parian-marble Roman bust of Cleopatra exists in the Capitoline Museums of Rome, but it features her wearing an Egyptian-style vulture headdress instead of a diadem. Modern day The modern day significance of the statue can be found in its rarity and its academic properties. In regards to rarity, Roberta Shaw states that \\"the ROM's statue of Cleopatra VII forms part of a pair,\\" and is believed that \\"the sister statue resides in Alexandria.\\" This pair is one of a kind, as no other unique pair of related statues of this iconic ancient queen during the period 69 - 30 BC have been discovered (although other sculptures of her exist). For this reason, the ROM's statue gives all the opportunity to examine Ptolemaic/Roman egyptianizing style of sculpture, establish a timeline to other period sculpture, and as Ashton states it \\"likely shows us the earliest representations of Cleopatra in two roles: queen and goddess of Egypt.\\" See also *Cleopatra VII *Ptolemaic Dynasty *Ptolemaic Kingdom *Ancient Egypt *Arsinoe II References Category:1st-century BC sculptures Category:1900s archaeological discoveries Category:Archaeological discoveries in Egypt Category:Cultural depictions of Cleopatra Category:Collections of the Royal Ontario Museum Category:Granite sculptures in Canada Category:Ptolemaic Kingdom Category:Collection of the Brooklyn Museum Category:Hellenistic sculpture Category:Busts in Canada Category:Sculptures of women in Canada Category:Busts (sculpture) ","title":"Bust of Cleopatra"},{"id":"39077711","text":"Deka Lake is a freshwater body of water located in the Cariboo region of British Columbia.

Distribution From approximately the 22nd to 18th centuries , it occupied an area stretching from the Don to Moldavia, including Dnieper Ukraine, Right- bank Ukraine, and part of the modern Ternopil Oblast, and was bordered by the Volga to the east. Origins KMK succeeded the western Catacomb culture. Characteristics In 1929, the archaeologist Ya. Brik studied four kurgans of this culture near Ostapye village, Podvolochisk raion, Ukraine. He found ceramics, flint tools, bone and bronze decorations. Bottoms, walls and ceilings of the graves are layered with rocks. Skeletons are laid in contracted position towards the east. The name of this culture is related to its ceramic goods, such as pots, which were decorated with multiple strips of clay (cordons) before firing. The culture also featured various other distinctive ornaments KMK tribes practiced herding and made widespread use of chariots. Physical type The physical type of the Multi-cordoned Ware culture has been designated as dolichocephalic. Ethnicity Circumstantial evidence links KMK to the spread of one or more Indo-European languages. Leo Klejn identifies its bearers with the early Thracians. Other scholars suggest that KMK may have been connected to the Bryges and/or Phrygians. Successors It was increasingly influenced, assimilated and eventually displaced by the Timber grave or Srubna/Srubnaya culture.–í–∞–ª–∏–∫–æ–≤–æ–π –∫–µ—Ä–∞–º–∏–∫–∏ –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞ // –ë–†–≠. –¢.4. –ú.,2006.–ö–∏–º–º–µ—Ä–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–µ—Ä–∏–æ–¥ // –ë–†–≠. –¢.13. –ú.,2008.–ö–∏–º–º–µ—Ä–∏–π—Ü—ã // –ë–†–≠. –¢.13. –ú.,2008.–ï–≤—Ä–∞–∑–∏–π—Å–∫–∞—è —Å—Ç–µ–ø–Ω–∞—è –º–µ—Ç–∞–ª–ª—É—Ä–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –ø—Ä–æ–≤–∏–Ω—Ü–∏—è // –ë–†–≠. –¢.9. –ú.,2007.

Her death has been attributed to online distribution of photos of an alleged gang rape that occurred 17 months prior to her suicide, in November 2011. On a Facebook page set up in tribute to her daughter, Parsons' mother blamed the four boys who allegedly raped and released images of her, the subsequent constant \\"bullying and messaging and harassment\\", and the failure of the Canadian justice system, for her daughter's decision to commit suicide. In response to Parsons' suicide, Nova Scotia enacted a law in August 2013 allowing victims to seek protection from cyberbullying and to sue the perpetrator. Background In November 2011, Rehtaeh Parsons, then 15, allegedly went with a friend to a home in which she was reportedly raped by four teenage boys. The teenagers were drinking vodka at a small party. Parsons had little memory of the event, except that, at one point, she vomited while a boy was allegedly raping her. The incident was photographed and the photo became widespread in Parsons' school and town in three days. Afterwards, many in school called Parsons a \\"slut\\" and she received text messages and Facebook messages from people requesting to have sex with her. The alleged rape went unreported for several days until Parsons broke down and told her family, who contacted an emergency health team and the police.\\"Rape, bullying led to N.S. teen's death, says mom\\", CBC News, April 9, 2013, URL accessed April 13, 2013. According to an RCMP report, in March 2013, six boys, including some of Parsons' accused rapists, had an angry argument with three other boys. One of the three boys, who was a friend of Parsons, was stabbed and treated for a \\"non-life- threatening injury\\".\\"Rehtaeh Parsons Case Connected To Stabbing?,\\" The Huffington Post Canada, April 16, 2013, URL accessed April 16, 2013. Investigation A year following the alleged rape, the RCMP concluded an investigation stating, \\"[an] investigation into an earlier sexual assault was completed, and in consultation with the Crown, there was insufficient evidence to lay charges\\". According to the family, the boys were not questioned and their phones were not reviewed for the photograph of the rape in progress. Instead, the police called it a \\"he said, she said\\" case and also decided the photo was not criminal, in spite of Parsons being a minor. Likewise, there were no arrests for the March 2013 stabbing incident. Following the suicide, the RCMP announced they were reviewing the case. On April 12, the RCMP announced the case was being reopened in light of \\"new and credible information\\" that they said did not come from the Internet.\\"Rehtaeh Parsons case to be reopened by police,\\" CBC News, April 12, 2013, URL accessed April 13, 2013. In September 2014, one of the boys, by then 20, pleaded guilty to a charge of making child pornography in relation to the photo of Parsons. Citing the offender's age at the time of the crime and Canada's Youth Criminal Justice Act, the Crown had advised the Judge that the only possible penalties in this case were either probation or a conditional discharge. In November 2014, the first defendant to plead guilty was sentenced to a conditional discharge with 12 months' probation. With a conditional discharge, his criminal record will not show a conviction in this case, unless he breaches the terms of his probation. Also in November 2014, the second person charged, then 19, pleaded guilty to a charge of distributing child pornography, in relation to the photo of himself and Parsons. He was sentenced on January 15, 2015, to one year of probation and required to submit a sample to a DNA database. In an unusual move for a case involving minors convicted of a crime, the judge ruled that this conviction would be kept in his criminal record for a period of five years. Milton‚ÄìPepler inquiry On June 14, 2013, the 56-page report of Penny Milton and Debra Pepler, two education experts from Ontario, was released.CH: \\"Rehtaeh Parsons report: Review IWK, Capital Health programs\\", June 14, 2013.therecord.com: \\"Rehtaeh Parsons cyberbullying report calls for hospital review\\", June 14, 2013.ottawasun.com: \\" Rehtaeh Parsons report calls for changes to Nova Scotia curriculum\\", June 14, 2013. The provincial government of Darrell Dexter requested the report, which is entitled \\"External Review of the Halifax Regional School Board‚Äôs Support of Rehtaeh Parsons\\". One conclusion of the report was that Nova Scotian schools \\"need to do a better job preventing harassment and sexual aggression\\".theobserver.ca: \\"Rehtaeh Parsons report calls for changes to Nova Scotia curriculum\\", June 14, 2013. Significantly, the authors recommended an external review of the IWK Health Centre, the Halifax hospital where she was a patient for five weeks after she had a breakdown and became suicidal. Canning said that Parsons was strip-searched by two men while receiving treatment in 2012 at the IWK, while the IWK denied the allegations. The authors met with 111 people, including school board staff, Ministerial staff, school staff, youth, police, health-care workers and others. The authors received more than 150 submissions from the general public, but curiously failed to interview Parson's friends or her teachers. Among the 13 recommendations made by the authors were: * involving young people in advisory roles; * ensuring that students help develop policies that affect them; * clarifying the process for transferring students between schools; * engaging parents; * removing barriers between government bodies that serve students and their families; * stronger anti-bullying and anti-sexual aggression policies in schools; * restorative justice to help students \\"learn from their mistakes\\"; * more young people in government advisory roles; * better school engagement with parents; * a curriculum that includes \\"intellectual, ethical, social-emotional, and physical development for all students\\"; * schools should ensure harassment allegations are thoroughly investigated and perpetrators punished. The report traced Parson's history through the school system. She was transferred from Cole Harbour District High School, to Dartmouth High School, to Prince Andrew High School to Citadel High School. It recommended that the Halifax Regional School Board clarify the transfer approval process between schools, in order to stamp out any inconsistencies between policy and practices. School boards need to share more information when kids transfer schools, as Parsons did to escape harassment. \\"The school to which Rehtaeh transferred received no information about these events and did not get to know Rehtaeh well,\\" the report noted. Segal inquiry The Parsons case also prompted an external inquiry into the conduct of the Crown Prosecutor's office. This inquiry, which was requested by the Dexter government in August 2013 and released on October 8, 2015, during the government of Stephen McNeil, was performed by Murray Segal, a former chief prosecutor in Ontario.macleans.ca: \\"Review: Crown decision in Rehtaeh Parsons‚Äô case was reasonable>, October 8, 2015.cbc.ca: \\"Rehtaeh Parsons report makes 17 recommendations\\", October 8, 2015.globalnews.ca: \\"Rehtaeh Parsons report prompts review of how school boards deal with police>, October 15, 2015.ctvnews.ca: \\"Report provides validation for family of Rehtaeh Parsons\\", October 9, 2015. The report was delayed until legal proceedings involving two men charged with child pornography offences in the case concluded. Segal made 17 recommendations, and found the system \\"failed\\" on just about every level; a series of improvements to policies, procedures and actions relating to cyberbullying, sexual violence, investigations and prosecutions was contained in the report, but significantly Segal wrote that it was reasonable of the Crown Prosecutor's office to conclude there was no realistic prospect that sexual assault charges would result in conviction, and thus \\"the decision not to lay charges of sexual assault was understandable.\\" Significantly, the Segal report found that school board officials prevented a police investigator from talking to students at Parsons‚Äô school. The police investigator \\"made an attempt to attend at the school to interview as many students as possible about the photo... This attempt was apparently thwarted by school authorities.\\" Segal found that it was \\"important that either police or school authorities\\" speak to the students. Segal continued: \\"Some work has also been done to clarify how schools and police interact, (but) we were informed that there is a lot of mystique around police investigations from the schools‚Äô perspective: school authorities are loath to act when they are aware of an active criminal investigation, because they do not want to influence the evidence or prejudice the investigation.\\" Education Minister Karen Casey said one week after the report's release that \\"each of the province‚Äôs school boards has its own protocol when it comes to dealing with police investigations on school property.\\" Other recommendations include that: * the Halifax Regional Police and the RCMP revise their sexual assault and child abuse policies; * police should create a policy for interviewing underage victims of sexual assault; * an integrated police sex crimes unit that works more closely with the sexual assault investigation team be created; * police and Crown prosecutors be given specific training as soon as they are assigned to deal with such crimes; * more Crown prosecutors with specialized training be available; * a memorandum should be written when the Crown decides there are insufficient grounds to lay a charge or feels there is no realistic chance of a conviction. Segal made it clear that Parsons' complaint of sexual assault and cyberbullying was mishandled, and as early as one day later there were calls to implement his recommendations. \\"Simply making the report doesn't guarantee it happens. You need to have a number of people holding [the government] to account and seeing what's actually done\\", said Dalhousie law professor Wayne MacKay. Reactions Following the suicide, Rehtaeh Parsons's mother, Leah Parsons, went public with the story and started a memorial Facebook page called \\"Angel Rehtaeh.\\" The blog of Rehtaeh's father, Glen Canning, also went viral. The story drew international attention and sparked outrage on the Internet, with CBC reporting the phrase \\"Nova Scotia\\" was \\"trending on Twitter worldwide.\\"\\"Rehtaeh Parsons' mom calls for vigilantes to stop,\\" CBC News, April 10, 2013, URL accessed April 13, 2013. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper commented on the case, saying he was \\"sickened\\" by the story and that the online bullying was \\"simply criminal activity.\\"\\"Stephen Harper 'sickened' by Rehtaeh Parsons story,\\" CBC News, April 11, 2013, URL accessed April 13, 2013. Rehtaeh's funeral on April 13 was attended by 500 people, including Nova Scotia Premier Darrell Dexter, who said he came \\"first and foremost as a father trying to imagine what kind of incredible, unfathomable grief could be visited upon a family.\\"\\" Friends, family, dignitaries attend Rehtaeh Parsons funeral,\\" CBC News, April 13, 2013, URL accessed April 13, 2013. There are reports that members of the hacker group Anonymous involved itself in tracing the alleged perpetrators of the incidents Parsons suffered. In its news release, Anonymous blamed the death on \\"school teachers, administrators, the police and prosecutors, those who should have been role models in the late Rehtaeh's life.\\" Later, Anonymous announced it would not publicize the names of the individuals it believed to be the rapists, in respect of the Parsons family's wishes.\\"'Anonymous' won't release names of Rehtaeh Parsons suspects,\\" CBC News, April 12, 2013, URL accessed April 13, 2013. Leah Parsons had called for the case to be settled legally rather than by vigilantes. Parsons' suicide and the circumstances surrounding it have been compared to those of British Columbian Amanda ToddTu Thanh Ha and Jane Taber, \\"Bullying blamed in death of Nova Scotia teen,\\" The Globe and Mail, April 9, 2013, URL accessed April 26, 2013. and with Audrie Pott, a fifteen-year-old girl from Saratoga, California, United States, and appear to show highly similar characteristics. New laws are being considered after these events. Parsons has been described as a \\"victim of sexting\\". After her suicide, posters appeared locally in support of the boys who allegedly attacked Parsons. The RCMP expressed concern that the posters might lead to vigilantism, although they did not name the accused. On April 26, 2013, Christie Blatchford wrote in the National Post that a problem in the case was that one of Parsons' friends claimed Parsons was \\"flirtatious\\" on the night the photo was taken, was seen laughing in bed with two boys and also there were \\"accounts from Rehtaeh herself and independent evidence, including retrieved online messages, that supported the suggestion the sex that took place was consensual.\\" Blatchford also wrote the photo did not show Parsons' face.Christie Blatchford, \\"Why there may never be a case against the alleged Rehtaeh Parsons rapists ,\\" National Post, April 26, 2013, URL accessed April 26, 2013. In response, Parsons' father, Glen Canning, accused Blatchford of victim blaming and argued, \\"The two boys involved in taking and posing for the photograph stated Rehtaeh was throwing up when they had sex with her. That is not called consensual sex. That is called rape.\\"Allison Cross, \\"'It‚Äôs always about the victim': Rehtaeh Parsons' father responds to Christie Blatchford's column,\\" National Post, April 26, 2013, URL accessed April 26, 2013.  Legislative impact  In August 2013, Nova Scotia enacted a law allowing victims of cyberbullying to seek protection, including help in identifying anonymous perpetrators, and to sue the individuals or the parents in the case of minors. The law was passed in response to Parsons' suicide. That law was quashed in 2015 by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court who ruled the law's definition of cyberbullying was too wide and infringed on Charter rights and freedom of expression. A replacement law, the Intimate Images and Cyber- protection Act, was passed in 2017BILL NO. 27 / Intimate Images and Cyber- protection Act. NSLegislature.ca. Retrieved July 30, 2019. and came into force in 2018.  Publication ban  Canadian media reports about criminal trials involving child pornography are subject to a publication ban under the Criminal Code: they must omit any information that would identify any minor who was involved in or witness to the case, including the victim, or be subject to fines. In November 2014, the Halifax Chronicle Herald violated the ban by publishing the name and photo of Parsons on its front page and online; the story was accompanied by an editor's note, stating: \\"We've decided to publish the name of the victim in this story, despite a court-ordered ban. We believe it's in the public interest in this unique case, given the widespread recognition of [her] name, and given the good that can come, and has already come, from free public debate over sexual consent and the other elements of her story.\\" Noting that her name and photo had been widely disseminated prior to the trial, both the victim's parents and the trial's judge objected to the ban. The Chronicle Herald became the subject of investigation for its actions following complaints by police, although other media outlets have been investigated in Halifax for violating the ban but have not been subject to any charges. In December 2014, Nova Scotia's attorney general announced that she was directing the province's Public Prosecution Service to pursue breaches of the publication ban in Parsons' case only if the breach is derogatory of Rehtaeh Parsons. The ban remains technically in place but unbiased reports about the case will not be subject to prosecution.

Background   Iran Air Tours Flight 962  On that day, EP-ITD, loaded with 119 passengers and 12 crew, lifted off from runway 29R at Tehran's Mehrabad Airport on a non-scheduled domestic flight to Mashhad International Airport in Mashhad. The aircraft was flown by an unnamed Russian captain who had 12,000 flight hours (the info on the remaining flight crew is unknown). After takeoff the aircraft was instructed to climb to .  Sukhoi Su-24  At the same time, five IRIAF Sukhoi Su-24 fighter jets were on approach to Mehrabad's runway 29L using visual flight rules (VFR). They would later be performing special maneuvers for the Iranian Revolution Commemoration Ceremony. These fighter jets were flying in a westerly heading and were placed at an altitude of by Mehrabad air traffic controller (ATC) Faramarz Sarvi.  Collision  Flight 962 was climbing in the direction of runway 29R, and at the same time, while the five Su-24's were descending to land on runway 29L. All five of them were separated one mile apart. One of the Su-24's, piloted by a crew of two, turned left 4 miles west of the tower but did not have enough visibility as it was performing an orbit. At this point, Flight 962 was nearing this Sukhoi aircraft. Flight 962 and the Su-24 did not obtained visual sight of each other. At about 14:16 IRST, the two aircraft collided in mid-air; the rear engine and tail of the Tupolev aircraft were torn off, and the flight crew lost control. Both aircraft crashed into an army depot in the town of Shahr-e Qods, near Tehransar, about 9.4 miles from Mehrabad. All 131 people aboard the Iran Air Tours airliner and both military pilots died.  Investigation  Investigators determined that the pilot of Flight 962 followed exactly the instructions. Iran's Civil Aviation Authority concluded that the causes of the collision were: errors made by the military pilots of the Sukhoi Su-24 and air traffic controller error. The primary causes were: # The air traffic controller's decision to allow Flight 962 to climb while the Sukhoi Su-24's were descending. # The controller's failure to inform Flight 962 about the Sukhoi Su-24's entering their airspace. # Failure to notify the military pilots about take-off of a Tupolev at the same time as the Sukhoi turns left. # The controller did not express concern about the distance between the two aircraft. # The Sukhoi pilots's failure to maintain the altitude requested by ATC, which caused the two aircraft to collide.

History  The Accademia Antoniana as it was first called, was founded in 1458, but its origins dates back to 1443 in an academic circle around the Neapolitan scholar and poet Antonio Beccadelli. This circle met informally in the Castel Nuovo of Alfonso V of Aragon. After the death of Beccadelli in 1471 these meetings were overseen by Giovanni Pontano, hence the name Accademia Pontaniana. During its centuries-old history, the Academy was closed twice. The first closure was in 1542 by the Spanish viceroy of Naples Pedro √Ålvarez de Toledo, Marquis of Villafranca, as part of his harsh policy of \\"spagnolizzazione\\" (\\"Spanish-ization\\").

Demolition avoided an annual property tax of $10,788 on an assessed valuation of $372,000.Bangor and Aroostook Railroad Historical and Technical Society The BAR Newsletter December 1976 volume III, issue IV, pages 5-7 The station site is now occupied by the Penobscot Plaza Shopping Center. Construction The station was built for the Maine Central Railroad under the supervision of Elbridge A. Johnston of the University of Maine class of 1902. The station building was long and wide with a by wing and a separate by building for baggage, mail and express rooms. The station with a clock tower on the front was built of buff-colored brick with brownstone trimmings and base. The clock tower was capped with a steeply peaked roof above an open octagonal cupola. The principal entrance was defined by a porte- coch√®re opening into an vestibule to a by waiting room with an adjoining dining room, kitchen and store room. A women's retiring room and toilet were located to the right side of the vestibule, and the ticket office, agent's office, news stand, smoking room, and men's toilet were of the opposite side of the vestibule. Marble flooring was used in the entrance, waiting room, dining room, smoking room, and women's retiring room. The station included a train shed covering 8 tracks. Location The station was built on the west bank of the Penobscot River estuary just upstream of the confluence with Kenduskeag Stream. The train shed extended upstream from the station covering tracks between the station and the Penobscot River. Three tracks ran through and the remaining five were stubs extending downstream. The Maine Central Eastern Division main line extended upstream from the station to connect with the Canadian Pacific Railway to the Maritimes at Vanceboro, Maine. Maine Central Eastern Division branch line trains to Calais, Bar Harbor, or Bucksport required backing moves to cross the Penobscot River bridge approach upstream of the station.

She is also known for her career as music teacher in the Chicago Public Schools system, most notably at Kenwood Academy. Early life McLin was born in Atlanta, Georgia. At the age of five she was sent to live with her uncle, Thomas A. Dorsey. She attended the Pilgrim Baptist Church as a child, where she was exposed to gospel music and served as an accompanist to her uncle's choir. McLin has a bachelor's degree in music, specializing in piano and violin, from Spelman College, and a graduate degree in music from the American Conservatory of Music. Career Teaching McLin taught in Chicago at Hubbard High School, Harlan High School, and Kenwood Academy. At Kenwood she taught Mandy Patinkin, Deitra Farr, and Kim English. Her other students have included R. Kelly, Tammy McCann, Chaka Khan, Da Brat, Mark Rucker, Robert Sims, and Jennifer Hudson. She was called \\"the woman who launched a thousand careers\\" by art critic Howard Reich of the Chicago Tribune. R. Kelly has stated that it was McLin that convinced him to pursue a career in music over basketball, that he considers McLin his \\"second mother\\", and that she has remained an influence in his career continuously since his high-school days. With her encouragement, R. Kelly wrote his first song, about poverty in Africa. Mclin officially retired from teaching high school in the mid-1990s but continued teaching voice lessons. She taught for 36 years, all at Chicago area public schools. She has also given lectures at the Peabody Institute. McLin published the book Pulse: A History Of Music in 1977. She also has a library of choral works published by the Neil A. Kjos Music Company. Music McLin founded the McLin Ensemble in the 1950s, during which time she was serving as the public relations director of the Park District Opera Guild. She and the ensemble made their operatic debut in November 1960 at the Abraham Lincoln Center in Chicago, with a performance of The Cloak. McLin and her husband Nathanael also founded the McLin Opera Company in the mid-1950s, funded with their own money. The company was named the \\"nation's leading small opera company\\" by the Washington Afro-American in 1965. Under her direction the company performed on state, as well as on radio and television networks. McLin's own opera Oh Freedom was played at Carnegie Hall in 1983. She has composed a wide range of music, including cantatas, masses, and rock operas. Her work has built from both European classical traditions and tradition African-American music, and \\"works large and small that, in essence, merged European and African-American languages\\", according to Reich. She also fronts the gospel group Lena McLin & the McLin Singers.

Early on February 11, 2007, a zone of disturbed weather formed east of Madagascar. Four days later, Favio was named as intensified to a moderate tropical storm while moving southwest. On February 18, the storm was upgraded into a severe tropical storm. Then, it turned west in the general direction of Mozambique. Continuing to intensify, Favio was upgraded to a tropical cyclone early on February 19\\\\. Subsequently, the storm began to undergo rapid deepening; the small storm reached intense tropical cyclone status the next day before peaking in intensity. However, the cyclone had weakened somewhat prior to making landfall on February 22 in the Inhambane Province in Mozambique. It rapidly weakened over land and dissipated the next day. While strengthening, Favio brought heavy rains to southern Madagascar. After making landfall, Intense Tropical Cyclone Favio brought widespread damage to Vilanculos in Mozambique, where the cyclone killed four people and injured at least 70 in the town. About 80% of the town was destroyed. Overall, a total of ten people were killed by the storm and nearly 100 others were injured, and combined with an earlier flood, the storm caused $71 million (2007 USD) in damage. Around 130,000 homes suffered damage and 130 schools were leveled by the tropical cyclone. Across the nation, a total of 33,000 people were left homeless during the system. Cyclone Favio destroyed of crops. In Zimbabwe, 400 electricity poles were downed. During the aftermath of the storm, a number of agencies provided assistance to victims of Cyclone Favio in Mozambique. One agency donated $626,500, helping transport 50,000 mosquito nets to the devastated area. A total of 5,500 bars of soap, 1,600 buckets, 50 baths, and over 180 latrines were distributed to the victims of the devastated area. In all, the government was praised for how well they handled the disaster. Meteorological history Cyclone Favio originated from a zone of disturbed weather that was first classified by the M√©t√©o-France office on R√©union (MFR) at 1200 UTC February 11, 2007. Twelve hours later, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued their first advisory on the system. Midday on February 12, MFR upgraded the system into a tropical disturbance and noted that its rating at that time on the Dvorak technique was 2.0. According to the JTWC, an area of convection developed south-southwest of Diego Garcia. Initially, however, the convection was not very concentrated near the center. However, sea surface temperatures in the area were somewhat warm so gradual intensification was predicted and the storm was projected to become a severe tropical storm within 48 hours. Situated in an environment of low wind shear and good outflow, thunderstorm activity soon increased and thus started to consolidate around the storm's atmospheric circulation. Continuing to encounter more favorable conditions, the JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) on February 14. Meanwhile, MFR upgraded the system into a tropical depression. Eighteen hours later, the system was named Favio by the Meteorological Services of Mauritius as the system; according to MFR, had intensified into a moderate tropical storm. Moving very steadily southwest, the storm gradually intensified. Early on February 15, the JTWC announced that that system had intensified into a tropical storm. After intensifying slightly (based on JTWC data) that evening, the storm briefly weakened overnight, only to re-intensify the next morning. On February 16, Favio turned southwest in response to a large subtropical ridge. Despite low wind shear, Favio remained a moderate tropical storm for several days; however, on February 18, MFR announced that Favio had intensified into a severe tropical storm. Subsequently, the storm turned west as the ridge merged with another one centered over South Africa. Two days later, the agency then upgraded the system into cyclone status. At 0000 UTC that day, on February 19, the JTWC upgraded the system into a Category 1 hurricane-equivalent on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) though not much additional intensification was predicted. Cyclone Favio at landfall in Mozambique. Upon becoming a hurricane, thunderstorm activity began to develop around an eye. Favio turned west-northwest, traversing the Mozambique Channel while beginning to deepen. At 0000 UTC February 20, the JTWC declared that Favio had intensified into a Category 2 hurricane-equivalent on the SSHWS. Several hours later, Favio was then upgraded into an intense tropical cyclone by MFR as the system developed a very small eye. Simultaneously, Cyclone Favio was upgraded into a Category 3 hurricane on the SSHWS via the JTWC. During the afternoon hours of February 20, the JTWC reported that Favio had developed winds equivalent to Category 4 intensity. That evening, MFR noted that Cyclone Favio had peaked in intensity, with winds of , becoming the most intense tropical cyclone south of the 25th parallel over the Mozambique Channel since the satellite era began. Six hours later, the JTWC announced that Favio had peaked in intensity, with winds. This made Favio equal to a mid-level Category 4 hurricane. At the time of its peak, Favio had developed a well-defined eye. Shortly after its peak, Cyclone Favio began to weaken; the core of the storm started to become disrupted on the northwestern quadrant. The JTWC expected Favio to continue to weaken, and dissipate within 48 hours over land. The eye disappeared off of satellite imagery, though by early February 22, this feature had re-developed. That afternoon, the storm was estimated to have made landfall in southern Mozambique. At that time, the JTWC reported winds of , a Category 2 system on the SSHWS. On the other hand, MFR estimated winds of (an intense tropical cyclone). Upon making landfall, it did so on the seventh anniversary of the last intense tropical cyclone, Eline, to strike Mozambique. Favio was also the first tropical cyclone to hit the country since Cyclone Japhet did during the 2002‚Äì03 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone season. By early February 23, winds had dropped below hurricane-force according to the JTWC, while the storm dissipated later that day. Around that time, MFR stopped monitoring the system as well. Preparations Prior to the arrival of Favio, flooding swept over Mozambique weeks earlier, forcing 163,000 persons to seek shelter. The floods started in late December 2006 when the Cahora Bassa Dam overflowed its banks. The floods escalated in February 2007 when the Zambezi River broke its banks, flooding the surrounding areas in Mozambique. A total of 80,600 people were evacuated from their homes in the Tete, Manica, Sofala and Zambezia provinces on February 14. Twenty-nine people were confirmed dead due to the pre-Favio flood. While at peak intensity, the storm threatened Mozambique and forcing authorities to put the country on high alert. The British Foreign Office also issued a travel warning to Britons who were planning visits along the Bazaruto Archipelago. Additionally, the South African disaster management team was on full alert in the eastern portion of Mpumalanga. In addition, thousands of volunteers were placed on stand by. Some residents of Vilankulo attempted to flee the area carrying belongings and children as the government urged residents to seek shelter on higher ground further inland before the storm hit. They evacuated many of the people who remained, taking them to tent camps. Officials said that Favio could also bring heavy rains to Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Authorities in the latter issued a flood warning. Because of the topography of the region, meteorologists noted the potential for flooding in Zimabawe. Impact Madagascar While intensifying, Cyclone Favio brushed the southern tip of Madagascar while bringing heavy rains to the nation. Along the southeastern portion of the nation, road access was reduced. Favio disrupted relief operations to 582,000 people, who were struggling to cope with a drought in the southern portion of the nation. Moreover, the cyclone disrupted relief efforts during an aftermath of flood that killed three persons and displaced 33,000 people throughout the country. Overall, the cyclone was one of several storms to affect the nation during the season. Mozambique Map of Mozambique About 130,000 homes suffered damage and 130 schools were leveled by the intense tropical cyclone in Mozambique. In all, a total of ten people were killed by the storm and nearly 100 others were injured. Combined with an earlier flood, Favio caused $71 million (2007 USD) in infrastructural damage. About 64,000 people moved to tents during the storm, and 33,000 people were displaced during the storm. Cyclone Favio destroyed of crops, primarily in Vilanculos, Inhassoro, Govuro, and Masinga districts in Inhambane Province. Overall, 160,000 people were affected by the storm. Favio damaged the court in the resort town of Vilanculos in Southern Mozambique. Uprooted trees caused by the cyclone also blocked roads, cutting off access for rescuers to some homes. Power was also cut off to the city. The cyclone killed four people and injured at least 70 in the town, and thousands of homes were destroyed along with the hospital, where a total of 120 patients were evacuated. Additionally, 600 prisoners escaped when the local jail was demolished. About 80% of the town was destroyed. A total of 73,000 people were affected by the cyclone in Vilanculos. Elsewhere, the storm damaged trees and blew off rooftops in Pontagea, a highly populated suburb in the port city of Beira. Cyclone Favio was responsible for widespread damage in Tofo Beach, where the storm uprooted palm trees and destroyed electric services. Elsewhere, an airplane was crushed in an airport. Elsewhere In its formative stages, Favio dropped beneficial rainfall on Rodrigues island, reaching at Port Sud Est. Wind gusts on the island reached . In Zimbabwe, the Bvumba Mountains received heavy winds and rain. Throughout the country, damage was minimal and was mostly due to the uprooting of trees and not nearly as bad as Cyclone Leon‚ÄìEline, which devastated the nation seven years prior. However, electricity supplies were severely damaged. In one location, 400 wooden electricity poles were knocked down. Alongside moist air from the Intertropical Convergence Zone, Favio produced significant rains across much of Malawi, peaking at in Mimosa. Furthermore, the remnants of the low struck southern Tanzania. Cyclone Favio also destroyed 56 houses in Hai. Aftermath During the aftermath of the storm, South Africa offered helicopters to Mozambique to deliver food to shelters and to help Mozambican officials assess the situation aerially. The disaster management minister of South Africa flew into Mozambique to survey the damage. Due to the concern for potential disease epidemics including those of malaria and cholera, health officials raised public awareness through theaters and radio. A joint coalition of the United States Agency for International Development and the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided $626,500, enabling transportation of 50,000 mosquito nets to the devastated area. Oxfam International distributed of clean water per day for 15,000 displaced people in the Caia and Marromeu districts and housed 8,000 residents in Chupanga, where they also distributed 5,500 bars of soap, more than 3,000 mosquito nets, and 1,600 buckets. The agency also built 50 baths and over 180 latrines. In Calia, Oxfam also distributed 1,400 nets. Marromeu was also supplied 900 mosquito nets via Calia. The agency also agreed to provide drinking water to the victims of Favio for four months. The nation's president flew into the destructed area, lifting survivors' spirits. Within 48 hours following Intense Tropical Cyclone Favio, roofs were being repaired, and power lines were gradually being restored. Hundreds of local red cross staff and volunteers were utilized; they worked around the clock to assist survivors. Thirty-one recovery centers opened, hosting 400 first aid volunteers. According to a South African website, the government was praised for how well and quickly they handled the crisis. Key food items (rice, beans, corn meal, cooking oil, soap, and sugar) were distributed to the affected areas. On March 5, a plan was launched to provide victims for a total of $71 million worth of aid, of which $773,000 was expected to be directed towards the health. Meanwhile, water levels began to recede throughout the affected region. Moreover, a total of of aid were distributed through the central part of the nation, and provided clean water for 6,000 people. About 200 tents were provided for victims whose roofs of their homes were blown off. Furthermore, concerns rose about the potential outbreak of diseases like HIV. Within three months after the cyclone, 85% of homes had used the aid they were given.

They took the prime minister hostage during a handover ceremony for the US dredge Manhattan and brought him aboard the Navy's flagship HTMS Sri Ayudhya. However, they were met by the combined forces of the Royal Thai Army, Air Force and Police. Heavy fighting ensued, and Sri Ayudhya was sunk despite Phibun's presence on board; the prime minister had to swim ashore along with the ship's crew. The event led to the Navy being stripped of most of its power and influence. It also showed that political power actually lay with commanders of the Armed Forces rather than the prime minister. Events On 29 June 1951, a group of junior naval officers seized Phibun at gunpoint while he was attending the transfer ceremony of the US Navy dredge Manhattan to the Thai navy at Ratchaworadit Pier on the Chao Phraya River in Bangkok. Phibun was forcibly taken aboard the Thai navy flagship HTMS Sri Ayudhya and held hostage. General stations were called, and the ship began to make way downstream towards the Naval Ordnance Department in Bang Na. However, the coup plotters failed to secure the opening of the Memorial Bridge, so the warship could not continue downstream. Fighting quickly ensued, and the naval units that sided with the rebels became heavily outnumbered by the army, police, and air force, who were loyal to the government. Fighting subsided during the night of 29 June, but resumed and intensified early the next morning. Sri Ayudhya joined the fight, but its engines were soon disabled and the ship became dead in the water in front of Wichaiprasit Fort. It was heavily fired upon from the eastern bank by guns and mortars, and, by afternoon, was also bombarded by AT-6 trainer planes. Heavy fires broke out, and the order was given to abandon ship. Phibun had to swim ashore along with the sailors, but was uninjured. The fires continued throughout the night and into the next day, when fighting ceased. The heavily damaged Sri Ayudhya finally sank on the night of 1 July. The struggle led to the deaths of 17 military personnel, eight police officers, and 103 civilians. More than 500 people were wounded. Property damage amounted to 15 million baht and the loss of the navy's most powerful warship. In the aftermath, the navy's leadership was immediately fired, including Admiral Sindhu, its top commander. Seventy other officers were relieved of duty. More than 1,300 sailors suspected of joining or aiding the rebellion were arrested. All naval combat aircraft were handed over to the air force. Heavy naval weapons were confiscated. Naval bases in Bangkok were relocated to outer provinces such as Chonburi and Samut Prakan. The Thai Marines was downsized and placed under army command. The naval submarine fleet was decommissioned. The wreck of Sri Ayudhya was later salvaged for scrap, as it had become a navigational hazard. The ship was officially struck from the naval register on 8 October 1959 in Ministerial Order 350/21315.

The park is formed from 6 historical farm plots, with portions set aside for the Langley Tree Farm and scout Camp McLean. It contains a vast number of hiking, walking and equestrian trails as well as function facilities such as picnic shelters. The park is also the location of the Metro Vancouver Regional Parks East Area offices, located at the northwest corner of the park. Trails Within the park there are 29 kilometres of trails, all unpaved, 14 km of which are designated for equestrian use and 1 km of which is set aside solely for pedestrian and bicycle use. More bicycle trails have become available since the 2009 construction of the perimeter trail. Facilities There are two main entrances to the park and one main equestrian entrance. The two main entrances are the North Valley Entrance along 16th Avenue and the South Valley Entrance on 8th Avenue. The equestrian centre and parking lot are located on 208th Street, south of 16th Avenue. Other entrances include the entrance to Camp Coyote, a Metro Vancouver group camping site. Drinking water is available at both the North and South Valley Entrances. Shelter is available at the South Valley Entrance. Also at the South Valley Entrance is the Nature House, a visitor centre which provides occasional insight into the ecology of the park. It is located near a small pond and a gazebo. History Annand/Rowlatt Farmstead and Lochiel Schoolhouse The Southern end of the park is home to both the Rowlatt Farmstead and the historical Lochiel Schoolhouse. Both landmarks predate 1924. The Rowlatt Farmstead is occupied by a family and, although the fields and grounds are public, the fenced lawn around the house is private. Lochiel schoolhouse is occasionally opened upon reservation. Lochiel Schoolhouse is the namesake for √âcole √âl√©mentaire Lochiel, an all- French immersion elementary school which was closed by the school district in 2001. Logging In the late 19th century and the early 20th century, many logging companies took advantage of the temperate rainforest in the area and clearcut the entire park. During this time, logging railways wound throughout the park. The route of one such rail line is clearly visible today along the Ravine Trail at the South end of the park. The routes of the railways are marked on park maps. Throughout the second-generation rainforest, which has successfully recovered, many stumps of the fallen trees are left, some in excess of two metres across. These stumps bare the scars from springboards, the name for platforms that loggers would cut into the large trees to reach a narrower section of the trunk. Langley Speedway 304x304px An old paved racing oval is located in the eastern section of the park and is maintained by the Langley Speedway Historical Society. In the past, it was host to local and NASCAR racing events. Celebration of Nature On the third weekend of September, an annual two-day commerce fair is held at the Rowlatt Farm, which is a showcase of the local lifestyle and economy. Many artisans, confectioners and musicians showcase their skills at this event.

The match took place at the King of the Ring pay-per-view on June 28, 1998, at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It set the standard for future Hell in a Cell matches. During the bout, Foley received numerous injuries and took two dangerous and highly influential bumps. Journalist Michael Landsberg called it \\"maybe the most famous match ever.\\" Events leading up to the match Upon debuting with the World Wrestling Federation in 1996, Mankind immediately began feuding with The Undertaker, debuting the night after WrestleMania XII when Mankind interfered in The Undertaker's match with Justin Hawk Bradshaw. For the next few months, Mankind ambushed and cost The Undertaker several matches.2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \\"Wrestling‚Äôs historical cards\\" (p.95) The feud intensified, and they began taking their battles into crowds, backstage areas, and in the boiler rooms of different arenas. Mankind cost the Undertaker the Intercontinental Championship at In Your House 8: Beware of Dog, assisting champion Goldust to victory. The following month at King of the Ring saw Mankind defeat the Undertaker when the Undertaker passed out while Mankind applied the mandible claw on him. Both wrestlers continued to feud with each other during the summer months, and as a result, the first-ever Boiler Room Brawl was booked between the two at SummerSlam. During the match, when Undertaker reached for Paul Bearer's urn, Bearer hit him with it, betraying The Undertaker and allowing Mankind to \\"incapacitate\\" The Undertaker with the Mandible claw, giving him the win. After Bearer's betrayal, The Undertaker took his rivalry with Mankind to a new level, resulting in a Buried Alive match in the main event of In Your House: Buried Alive. The Undertaker won the match after a chokeslam into the open grave, but after interference from The Executioner, as well as the help of several other superstars, The Undertaker was ultimately \\"buried alive\\". After being buried alive, The Undertaker returned at Survivor Series, again pitting him against Mankind, but with a unique stipulation; hanging above the ring was Paul Bearer, enclosed in a steel cage. If Undertaker won the match, he would be able to get his hands on Bearer. Even though The Undertaker won the match, interference from The Executioner enabled Bearer to escape The Undertaker's clutches.PWI Staff. 2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \\"Wrestling‚Äôs historical cards\\" (p.96‚Äì97) With no manager, Undertaker developed a more humanized incarnation, with a different, gothic and rebelling attitude ‚Äî perhaps to better fit him to The Attitude Era, a more adult-oriented programming content period of World Wrestling Federation ‚Äî, proclaiming himself to be \\"The Lord of Darkness\\". After The Undertaker attended to other feuds and won the WWF Championship at WrestleMania 13, the feud with Mankind temporarily ended after one more match at In Your House: Revenge of the Taker, won by The Undertaker. In the following year, The Undertaker would either hold the WWF Championship or be in contention for it while Foley would gradually bring out his \\"Three Faces of Foley\\": Mankind, Dude Love, and his old gimmick from World Championship Wrestling and Extreme Championship Wrestling, Cactus Jack. Prelude to the match On the June 1, 1998, edition of Raw is War, Foley would revert to his Mankind character, who began wearing an untucked shirt with a loose necktie and restarted the feud with The Undertaker. Mankind reunited with Paul Bearer, the father and manager of Undertaker's (kayfabe) brother Kane, and the new alliance challenged Undertaker and WWF champion Stone Cold Steve Austin to the second Hell in a Cell match on the June 15 episode of Raw. That bout ended with Steve Austin and the Undertaker winning after the show had gone off the air. This set up the double main-event for King of the Ring; Austin and Kane in a First Blood match for the title, while Undertaker and Mankind would then be booked for a one-on-one inside Hell in a Cell. This match would be the third overall Hell in a Cell match and the second one on Pay Per View in 8 months. Before this match, Foley and Terry Funk were discussing the previous year's Hell in a Cell at Badd Blood: In Your House that featured the Undertaker backdropping and slamming Shawn Michaels onto the chain-link ceiling of the cage. Foley and Funk were brainstorming ideas about how to top that match when Funk said, \\"laughing, 'maybe you should let him throw you off the top of the cage.'\\" Foley: When presented with the idea of throwing Foley off the top of the cage, Undertaker was a little more hesitant, even going as far as to ask Foley, \\"Mick, do you want to die?\\" Ultimately, Undertaker reluctantly agreed to perform the spot. Fittingly for Foley, King of the Ring was scheduled to take place that year at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh. Foley himself trained to become a professional wrestler at Dominic DeNucci's wrestling school in nearby Freedom, Pennsylvania, only from Pittsburgh, bringing his career full circle.Foley, Have A Nice Day!, pp. 66‚Äì67, 78 Match details Foley came out first and once he reached the cell, he threw a chair on top of the structure and began to climb up to the top. The Undertaker then made his way to the ring, saw Foley on top of the cell, and also climbed to the top. Both wrestlers then began to fight on the roof of the cell. The first bump Foley would take came as both wrestlers were brawling on top of the cell, and the Undertaker threw Mankind from the top of the structure from a height of , if including the angle of the fall, and sent him crashing through the Spanish commentators' table, which triggered commentator Jim Ross to famously shout, \\"Good God almighty! Good God almighty! That killed him!\\" and \\"As God as my witness, he is broken in half!\\" Foley remained motionless underneath debris, while the Undertaker remained on top of the cell staring down. Foley's longtime friend Terry Funk was the first person on the scene, followed by WWF's resident doctor, Dr. Francois Pettit, and various others, including Vince McMahon, who broke character by looking legitimately worried about someone (Foley) that, on-air at least, he was supposed to dislike. Foley was placed on a stretcher and began to be wheeled out of the arena. Moments later, there was commotion on the entrance ramp as Foley got up from the stretcher and proceeded to make his way back to the cell, climbing to the top of the structure, with the Undertaker doing likewise (this time they both climbed the cell surprisingly quickly despite Foley having suffered a dislocated shoulder due to the fall, and the Undertaker wrestling with a broken foot that night). With both men back on the top of the cell the match resumed. Earlier as both were walking on the chain-link mesh which comprised the cell's ceiling, the metal fasteners were snapping off causing the roof to sag and partially give way under their combined weight. According to Terry Funk, the prop guy had purposely designed it that way, except it was never meant to give way completely. In the second huge bump of the night, the Undertaker chokeslammed Mankind atop the chain-link mesh cage, causing one panel to give way completely, resulting in Foley falling through and hitting the ring canvas hard below. In response, announcer Jim Ross shouted, \\"Good God...Good God! Will somebody stop the damn match? Enough's enough!\\"; along with color commentator Jerry Lawler adding, \\"That's it. He's dead.\\" The cage giving way completely was unplanned by both Foley and the Undertaker. The Undertaker later said that he thought Foley was dead following the second fall, yet he was able to stay in character.Foley, Have A Nice Day!, p. 480 Foley was genuinely knocked unconscious for a few moments from the impact, but was able to come around. Terry Funk wrote in his autobiography, \\"Watching from the back, I thought he was dead. I ran out here and looked down at him, still lying in the ring where he'd landed. His eyes weren't rolled back in his head, but they looked totally glazed over, like a dead fish's eyes.\\" Foley later said that the only reason he survived the fall was because he did not take the chokeslam properly, as he had been too exhausted to lift his body weight in response to the chokehold. In his memoir Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks, Foley called it both the best and worst chokeslam he ever took, saying that despite its looks, he would have likely died if he had landed properly. He also cited the fact that the ring onto which he landed had a harder surface than that of modern rings, which stopped his momentum once he landed. Foley would later explain that the roof of the cell was supposed to sag sufficiently so that Undertaker could kick him through, allowing him to dangle by his feet and eventually fall in a rotation to land on his front. Years later, The Undertaker would note that just before executing the chokeslam, he had been standing with his left foot on the same panel that Foley fell through, but at the last second decided to instead place it on the support bar the panel was attached to so that he would have more stability for lifting Foley; had he not done that, he would have fallen through and probably landed at least partially on Foley, thus potentially injuring Foley (and himself) far worse. Some time after getting up and being attended to again by the aforementioned personnel, TV cameras showed a lingering shot of Foley smiling through his profusely bleeding mouth and lips, with a loose tooth hanging beneath his nose; the tooth having been knocked out due to being struck by the chair which had fallen through the cage and landed on his face, dislocating his jaw.Foley, Have A Nice Day!, p. 657 The match continued for a while longer, ending with Foley being chokeslammed by the Undertaker onto a pile of thumbtacks, which Foley himself had strewn onto the ring canvas, and The Undertaker executing the Tombstone Piledriver to end the match and the feud as planned. Aftermath and legacy Both wrestlers received a standing ovation for the match. Foley has said that although this match grew in legend, the reality was that his career remained \\"somewhat sluggish\\" for sometime afterwards until Foley further developed the Mankind character, and fans began to catch on.Foley, Have A Nice Day!, p. 666 Foley would go on to become a three-time WWF Champion after the match, and would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 6, 2013, while Undertaker would develop his 'Streak' and win five more world championships. In the storyline; the cell reappeared that night, as both Undertaker and Mankind interfered in the Austin/Kane First Blood match. Kane won the WWF title, although the match is not considered an official Hell in a Cell match, and Austin won back the belt one night later on the June 29 episode of Raw. The fourth Hell in a Cell match took place on Raw is War two months later, between tag team champions Mankind and Kane, concluding their alliance. This bout, like the second cell match which was also televised on Raw, involved interference from Undertaker and Austin. Three official Hell in a Cell matches transpiring in the summer of 1998 made this particular four-way feud unique, as well as the WWF championship title changing hands within its confines. Many future matches attempted to replicate some of the spots from the match at King of the Ring. In his autobiography Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks, Foley wrote that he could not remember much of what happened, and he had to watch a tape of the match to write about it. The match was voted Pro Wrestling Illustrateds Match of the Year for 1998. Although many fans regard the match as a classic, it has generated controversy as well. Critics charge that the falls in the match were so extreme and they set the bar for further bumps so high that the inevitable attempts to equal or surpass them would be very dangerous for any wrestlers involved. While WWE continues to have Hell in a Cell matches‚Äîand even now has an annual pay-per-view featuring the match‚Äîthe match itself has been toned down somewhat in the wake of WWE's move towards more family-friendly programming since 2008. Foley himself acknowledged in 2014 while being interviewed about the Monday Night Wars that had the match taken place today, WWE would have immediately stopped the match after the first fall off the top of the cage \\"and rightfully so.\\"Monday Night War: WWE vs. WCW Have a Nice Day! Foley said in his first book that his wife cried during a post-match phone conversation between the two, and this made Foley strongly consider retiring from wrestling,Foley, Have A Nice Day!, pp. 663‚Äì664 something that Foley did eventually do on a full-time basis in 2000. Fittingly, his last match as a full-time wrestler was also a Hell in a Cell match at No Way Out in February 2000; Foley decided to replicate his fall through the roof of the cell during the match and proper precautions were taken to ensure his safety performing the stunt. After the match, Vince McMahon said to Foley, \\"You have no idea how much I appreciate what you have just done for this company, but I never want to see anything like that again.\\" He also made mention in the book of a rather humorous exchange he and Undertaker had while being checked out more thoroughly by Dr. Pettit in the backstage area. Foley, still somewhat dazed from the concussion he sustained, turned to the Undertaker and asked \\"Did I use the thumbtacks?\\", which was a staple of a number of Foley's early matches. The Undertaker looked at him and rather sternly replied \\"Look at your arm, Mick!\\", at which point Foley discovered a significant number of thumbtacks still lodged in his arm. In 2011, this incident was named as the number one \\"OMG!\\" incident in the WWE history. Both participants have said that the original Hell in a Cell match, between The Undertaker and Shawn Michaels at Badd Blood: In Your House on October 5, 1997, was superior; The Undertaker named the Badd Blood contest as his favorite match,The Undertaker interview (Part 2). The Score. April 10, 2003. while Foley called it the greatest Hell in a Cell bout ever. In 2019, Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter wrote that \\"with 20 years of perspective\\", this match \\"was a terrible thing because of all the stunt bumps it encouraged and how guys got into the business thinking they could get over by doing that stuff rather than wrestling.\\" Meltzer also wrote that New Japan Pro Wrestling's match of Kota Ibushi versus Tetsuya Naito at Dominion 6.9 in Osaka-jo Hall was the modern successor of Undertaker-Mankind in lacking safety for the wrestlers, but is \\"probably going to be copied and admired\\".

He was the longest serving member, later termed Father of the House, from 1729 to 1730. Early life Justinian Isham II was born on 11 August 1658 to Sir Justinian Isham, 2nd Baronet of Lamport, and his wife Vere Leigh, the daughter of Thomas Leigh, 1st Baron Leigh of Stoneleigh, Warwickshire. He matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford in 1674, but did not take a degree. and was admitted at Lincoln's Inn in 1677. He succeeded unexpectedly to the baronetcy of Lamport and Lamport Hall, Northamptonshire on 26 July 1681 with the sudden death of his brother Sir Thomas Isham from smallpox. He married, on 16 July 1683, in Stoke Rochford, Lincolnshire, Elizabeth Turnor (1666-1713), the only daughter of Sir Edmund Turnor (1619-1707) of Stoke Rochford Hall in Kent, and his wife Margaret Harrison (1623-1679), the daughter of Sir John Harrison (1589-1669).Brainard (1938), p. 62-63. Lamport Hall, Northamptonshire Career Isham was returned as Member of Parliament for Northampton at the 1685 English general election. He was returned again at the 1689 English general election, but was defeated at the 1690 English general election. He was returned unopposed, through an electoral pact, for Northampton at a by- election on 9 March 1694 and was returned again at the 1695 English general election. He was ready to stand again for the borough at the 1698 English general election, but with four days notice, he was called upon by the local gentry to stand for Northamptonshire. Although not prepared to put himself out because of the short notice, he was returned in a contest as MP for Northamptonshire. He was classed as Country Party but was frequently absent from Parliament, probably for domestic reasons. He was returned again at the first general election of 1701, and was blacklisted for opposing the preparations for war. He was returned again at the second general election of 1701 and in 1702 supported the motion vindicating the Commons‚Äô late proceedings in impeaching the Whig ministers. He topped the poll at the 1702 English general election. He did not vote for the Tack on 28 November 1704 and was identified as a 'sneaker'. At the 1705 English general election he was returned in another contest for Northamptonshire at the top of the poll, despite a lackluster campaign. He voted against the Court candidate for the Speaker and in support of his cousin, William Bromley on 25 September 1705. At the 1708 British general election he was returned unopposed as Tory MP for Nothamptonshire. Domesticity and ill-health led to absence from Parliament, but he was able to vote against the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. He was returned unopposed again at the 1710 British general election and was listed in April 1711 as a ‚ÄòTory patriot‚Äô who voted for the peace, and as a ‚Äòworthy patriot‚Äô who helped expose the mismanagements of the previous administration. He also appears to have played a part in organizing the October Club. By 1713 he was suffering from gout but his wife was seriously ill, and died in August 1713. Isham was returned unopposed for Northamptonshire again, but after the shattering blow to his domestic contentment, was in severe depression for a year. He finally returned to public life in August 1714. Isham was returned again for Northamaptonshire at the 1715 British general election and from then on voted consistently with the opposition. He was returned again at the 1722 British general election and at the 1727 British general election. Death and legacy Isham died on 13 May 1730 at 72 years of age and was buried at Lamport next to his wife who had predeceased him by several years. They had several children, ten of whom survived, including the three sons listed below. * Sir Justinian Isham (1687-1737), who succeed his father as the 5th Baronet of Lamport * Sir Edmund Isham (1690-1772), who became the 6th Baronet of Lamport upon the death of his brother * Euseby Isham (1697-1755), who became the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University.

It follows South Zhongshan Road and No. 2 East Zhongshan Road, crosses Yan'an Road, a major east-west artery (with a major exit to and from Yan'an Road), then follows East No. 1 Zhongshan Road through the Bund.

William Ury, negotiator and author of Getting to YES helped found the project at Harvard University's Program on Negotiation. Ury's TED Talk speaks about the beginnings of the path and the vision behind the Initiative. Ury says that every culture has an origin-story, and that the origin-story of the Middle East is about how a man and his family walked the Middle East about four thousand years ago. The Abraham Path Initiative is endorsed by the United Nations World Tourism Organization, the United Nations Alliance of Civilizations and other international partners . The initiative is a non-profit, non-religious and non-political organization, whose mission is to support local partners in developing the Abraham Path as: * a catalyst for socioeconomic development and sustainable tourism. * a place of meeting and connection between people from the Middle East and people around the world. * a creative space for stories that highlight the unique culture, heritage and hospitality of the region.

While on a relief trip to Haiti, Jackson saw the poor living conditions of many of the country's children, and decided to open an orphanage for street children in Haiti. In 2004, they opened a home for seven children in Port-au-Prince. As of 2013, Planting Peace is operating four orphanages in Haiti and two in India. In 2005 Jackson began an effort to provide de-worming medicine to children in Haiti. As of 2013, Planting Peace has provided de- worming medicine to over 13 million children worldwide, including the Dominican Republic, Republic of the Sudan, North Korea, and Haiti. In 2009, Planting Peace purchased of rain forest land in Peru. The group has also planted over one million moringa tree seeds in Haiti as part of reforestation efforts. In 2012, Planting Peace purchased a home across the street from Westboro Baptist Church, an anti-LGBT hate group in Topeka, Kansas. * * The Westboro Baptist Church is known for extreme ideologies, especially those against gay people.  It was headed by Fred Phelps and consists primarily of members of his family; in 2011, the church stated that it had about 40 members. The church is headquartered in a residential neighborhood on the west side of Topeka about three miles (5 km) west of the Kansas State Capitol.

As the load is increased, a critical value will be reached at which time the crack becomes open. Crack closure occurs from the presence of material propping open the crack faces and can arise from many sources including plastic deformation or phase transformation during crack propagation, corrosion of crack surfaces, presence of fluids in the crack, or roughness at cracked surfaces.  Description  Crack closure effect (example of R=0) During cyclic loading, a crack will open and close causing the crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) to vary cyclically in phase with the applied force. If the loading cycle includes a period of negative force or stress ratio R (i.e. R < 0), the CTOD will remain equal to zero as the crack faces are pressed together. However, it was discovered that the CTOD can also be zero at other times even when the applied force is positive preventing the stress intensity factor reaching its minimum. Thus, the amplitude of the stress intensity factor range, also known as the crack tip driving force, is reduced relative to the case in which no closure occurs, thereby reducing the crack growth rate. The closure level increases with stress ratio and above approximately R=0.7, the crack faces do not contact and closure does not typically occur. The applied load will generate a stress intensity factor at the crack tip, K producing a crack tip opening displacement, CTOD. Crack growth is generally a function of the stress intensity factor range, \\\\Delta K for an applied loading cycle and is :\\\\Delta K = K_\\\\text{max} - K_\\\\text{min} However, crack closure occurs when the fracture surfaces are in contact below the opening level stress intensity factor K < K_\\\\text{op} even though under positive load, allowing us to define an effective stress intensity range \\\\Delta K_\\\\text{eff} as :\\\\Delta K_\\\\text{eff} = K_\\\\text{max} - K_\\\\text{op} which is less than the nominal applied \\\\Delta K.  History  The phenomenon of crack closure was first discovered by Elber in 1970. He observed that a contact between the fracture surfaces could take place even during cyclic tensile loading. The crack closure effect helps explain a wide range of fatigue data, and is especially important in the understanding of the effect of stress ratio (less closure at higher stress ratio) and short cracks (less closure than long cracks for the same cyclic stress intensity).  Crack closure mechanisms   Plasticity-induced crack closure  The phenomenon of plasticity-induced crack closure is associated with the development of residual plastically deformed material on the flanks of an advancing fatigue crack. The degree of plasticity at the crack tip is influenced by the level of material constraint. The two extreme cases are: #Under plane stress conditions, the piece of material in the plastic zone is elongated, which is mainly balanced by an out-of-the-plane flow of the material. Hence, the plasticity-induced crack closure under plane stress conditions can be expressed as a consequence of the stretched material behind the crack tip, which can be considered as a wedge that is inserted in the crack and reduces the cyclic plastic deformation at the crack tip and hence the fatigue crack growth rate. #Under plane strain conditions and constant load amplitudes, there is no plastic wedge at large distances behind the crack tip. However, the material in the plastic wake is plastically deformed. It is plastically sheared; this shearing induces a rotation of the original piece of material, and as a consequence, a local wedge is formed in the vicinity of the crack tip.  Phase-transformation-induced crack closure  Deformation-induced martensitic transformation in the stress field of the crack tip is another possible reason to cause crack closure. It was first studied by Pineau and Pelloux and Hornbogen in metastale austenitic stainless steels. These steels transform from the austenitic to the martensitic lattice structure under sufficiently high deformation, which leads to an increase of the material volume ahead of the crack tip. Therefore, compression stresses are likely to arise as the crack surfaces contact each other. This transformation-induced closure is strongly influenced by the size and geometry of the test specimen and of the fatigue crack.  Oxide-induced crack closure  Oxide-induced closure occurs where rapid corrosion occurs during crack propagation. It is caused when the base material at the fracture surface is exposed to gaseous and aqueous atmospheres and becomes oxidized. Although the oxidized layer is normally very thin, under continuous and repetitive deformation, the contaminated layer and the base material experience repetitive breaking, exposing even more of the base material, and thus produce even more oxides. The oxidized volume grows and is typically larger than the volume of the base material around the crack surfaces. As such, the volume of the oxides can be interpreted as a wedge inserted into the crack, reducing the effect stress intensity range. Experiments have shown that oxide-induced crack closure occurs at both room and elevated temperature, and the oxide build-up is more noticeable at low R-ratios and low (near-threshold) crack growth rates.  Roughness-induced crack closure  Misfit of fracture surfaces in roughness- induced crack closure Roughness induced closure occurs with Mode II or in- plane shear type of loading, which is due to the misfit of the rough fracture surfaces of the crack‚Äôs upper and lower parts. Due to the anisotropy and heterogeneity in the micro structure, out-of-plane deformation occurs locally when Mode II loading is applied, and thus microscopic roughness of fatigue fracture surfaces is present. As a result, these mismatch wedges come into contact during the fatigue loading process, resulting in crack closure. The misfit in the fracture surfaces also takes place in the far field of the crack, which can be explained by the asymmetric displacement and rotation of material. Roughness induced crack closure is justifiable or valid when the roughness of the surface is of same order as the crack opening displacement. It is influenced by such factors as grain size, loading history, material mechanical properties, load ratio and specimen type.

First presented by Ruth E. Fassinger in 1996 as a model of lesbian identity development, it was validated for men the following year.  Research  In 1991, Susan R. McCarn, a colleague of Fassinger's, studied identity development among a group of thirty-eight lesbians diversifying in age, education, race, ethnicity, and occupation. The analysis of the results of this study lead to the establishment of two processes and four phases, in 1996. In 1997, Fassinger and Brett A. Miller explored a similarly diverse group of gay men, validating the theory for men.  Theory  Fassinger proposed two processes of identity development: Individual sexual identity relating to one's internal awareness and acceptance of self, and group membership identity relating to one's role in the gay/lesbian community. Both processes consist of four sequential phases, in which an individual can reside in a different phase for each process: # Awareness: perceiving oneself as different from other people # Exploration: investigating feelings of attraction for individuals of the same sex # Deepening/Commitment: internalizing the sense of self as a gay or lesbian person # Internalization/Synthesis: incorporating one's sexual identity into one's overall identity Individuals can repeat phases as new environmental contexts occur, and development in one process can influence development in the other. For the group membership identity process, Fassinger offers specific markers for the demonstration of each phase: # Awareness of the existence of people with different sexual orientations # Exploration of one's relationship to the gay and/or lesbian community # Commitment to the gay and lesbian community, including an acceptance of the potentially negative consequences # Internalizing the minority group identity across contexts  See also  * Cass identity model * Gender identity  References  Category:1996 in LGBT history Category:Interdisciplinary subfields of sociology Category:Stage theories Category:Sexual identity models Category:Homosexuality ","title":"Fassinger's model of gay and lesbian identity development"},{"id":"39078789","title":"Joana Valle Costa"},{"id":"39078795","text":"The Bloss Mansion is a historic house located at 1020 Cedar Ave. in Atwater, California.

Plot  A young man upon finishing college announces to his publisher father that he wants to become a priest. The father who wants his son to take over the family business does not like this idea at all. He proposes a yacht trip to his son that will give them the chance to spend a few days together and maybe find a middle ground. Dad also invites his mistress without telling his son. During the trip there is a lot of sexual tension between the young man and the mistress. Despite the fact that she is his father's mistress the young man sleeps with her. The next day he asks for his father's forgiveness. After the trip the young man visits the company where he comes across a bizarre incident. One of the employees who was falsely accused of embezzlement commits suicide. Seeing that his father was responsible for the suicide, the young man feels sick and decides he has no place in such a company. Later on he meets his father's mistress who informs him that she was hired by his father to come along on the yacht trip. It was all a ploy by the father to corrupt his son and make him change his mind about priesthood. The last scene shows the young man staring at a dancing crowd of carefree and handsome young people . He is no longer certain about himself.  Themes Main themes are middle class guilt, and conflict between the spiritual and physical world. Purity versus Decadence. There are also suggestions concerning the latent homosexuality of the main character.

The siege, which was carried out by the combined allied forces of the Kingdom of Castile and the Taifa of Baeza, commanded by Ferdinand III of Castile and Abd Allah Ibn Muhammad Al-Bayyasi of Baeza against the defending Taifa of JayyƒÅn (ÿ¨ŸäÿßŸÜ) whose forces were commanded by the notable Christian knight, √Ålvaro P√©rez de Castro. The battle resulted in a JayyƒÅnese victory as the Castilian forces did not capture the city. Areas around the city were totally devastated as a result of the siege. The siege occurred as a part of Ferdinand III's first campaign which occurred roughly from 1224 to 1230 and was undertaken before the Siege of And√∫jar that same year.  Context  The taking of Ja√©n was perceived as being fundamental to let Kingdom of Castile expand into the Baetic Depression. The difficulty in this conquest were the notable Walls of Ja√©n which had been built by the Almohad Caliphate. They had been instrumental in repulsing an attack on the city by Alfonso VII of Le√≥n and Castile from 1151 to 1152, and another attack by the Almohads in 1162. Taking this into account, in 1224, Ferdinand III of Castile attacked the surrounding lands in what today is the province of Ja√©n, establishing their base of operations at Baeza with their Muslim ally, Abd Allah Ibn Muhammad Al- Bayyasi, the king of the Taifa of Baeza. This first campaign was essentially a probe to test the defenses of Ja√©n.  The Siege  The strong Castilian army accompanied King Ferdinand III of Castile from Toledo. On its march to Ja√©n, it was joined by Ferdinand III's vassal, the King of the Taifa of Baeza, Abd Allah Ibn Muhammad Al-Bayyasi and his forces. Ferdinand III's army approached the city with the intention of probing its defenses to find if it could be captured. During the siege, besieging Castilian camps were established in all the areas around Ja√©n, encircling the city completely. The soldiers in these camps were instructed to carry out a campaign of attrition on the surrounding countryside which they effectively plundered of all its resources, destroying any buildings. The major action of this siege occurred during one instance of such raids, which provoked defending troops of Ja√©n to raid the camps. The Castilians responded by assaulting the city walls in a failed attack. The siege was lifted shortly after this was realized, and the Castilian army moved instead on And√∫jar which they captured later in the same year, 1225.  Consequences  The siege by Castilian forces failed to take over the city, as the Castilian army did not have the siege equipment necessary to mount a prolonged siege. The Cr√≥nica de √Åvila, a contemporary source, does however recount the use of trebuchets at the battle. The defense of Ja√©n was led by 160 Christian knights who supported the Muslim defenders under the command of the Castilian magnate, √Ålvaro P√©rez de Castro el Castellano, head of the House of Castro and grandson of Alfonso VII of Le√≥n and Castile, the king of Castile and Le√≥n. According to the Christian chronicles, 3,000 knights and 50,000 foot soldiers defended the city in addition to the 160 Christian knights under Castro.

She was tried for war crimes at the Belsen Trial in L√ºneburg in 1945. Camp service and postwar trial Kohlmann was born in Hamburg to Margret and Georg Kohlmann, a Masonic leader. On April 1, 1940, she became a member of the NSDAP but until November 1944 worked as a streetcar conductor. On 4 November 1944, Kohlmann joined the SS Women's Auxiliary and was appointed as Aufseherin at the Neugraben subcamp of the notorious Neuengamme concentration camp system using prisoner forced labour in various locations across northern Germany. In March 1945, she was transferred to slave-labor camp in Hamburg-Tiefstack. Soon after the liberation she was arrested on the grounds of Bergen-Belsen after her former victims from Neugraben and Tiefstack identified her wearing prisoner clothes. She was kept in Celle prison until her trial. Kohlmann was found guilty of repeatedly whipping inmates including pregnant women across the face, kicking until they lost consciousness, condemning at least one female prisoner to punishment of 30 lashes for a piece of stolen bread, and sexually exploiting younger women. She was sentenced to only two-year prison term due to her short service in the SS and the defense claim that she did not kill anyone. After serving her sentence (cut in half by time spent in jail before trial) Kohlmann remained in Hamburg. She moved to West Berlin in 1965. On September 17, 1977 Kohlmann died in Berlin at the age of 56.

Brent Donnellan (born June 19, 1972) is a professor of psychology at Michigan State University. He is known for research on social psychology and personality psychology. Biography M. Brent Donnellan was born June 19, 1972 in Springfield, Ohio. Donnellan completed his undergraduate career at the University of California, Davis in 1994, receiving his bachelor's degree in Psychology. In 2001, he received his Ph.D. in human development from Davis. He joined the faculty of the Department of Psychology at MSU, Michigan State University. in 2003. Donnellan received tenure and a promotion from MSU in 2009. He currently holds the rank of professor of psychology. He previously taught at Texas A&M; University, where he served as Associate Department Head from January 2016 to August 2017. Donnellan has a long-standing affiliation with the Family Transitions Project, which follows participants as they make the transition from adolescence to adulthood. He is the author or co-author of 130 journal articles (out or in press), one edited book, 21 book chapters and one book under contract. Research Donnellan's research has encompassed various areas, including personality trait development, self-esteem development, personality and romantic relationships, and various methodological issues. His primary focus of research typically focuses on the development of personality throughout the lifespan as well as how characteristics vary from environment to environment. One aspect of the adolescence-adulthood transition that Donnellan has primarily focused on is self-esteem. He researched the pros and cons of high and low global self- esteem, which reflects a person‚Äôs overall evaluation of personal value and adequacy in relation to their ideal perception of who they are as a person.Donnellan, M.B., Kenny, D. A., Trzesniewski, K. H., Lucas, R. E., & Conger, R. D. (2012). Using trait-state models to evaluate the longitudinal consistency of global self esteem from adolescence to adulthood. \\"Journal of Research in Personality, 46\\", 634-645. Individuals with high self-esteem benefit from having well-rounded coping mechanisms and display behaviors that facilitate productive achievement, such as occupational success and academic achievement. They are typically able to avoid mental and physical health problems, substance abuse and antisocial behavior. They are also more likely to have healthy social relationships, persevere during difficult situations, have a positive sense of personal well-being, and receive positive opinions by peers.Trzesniewski, K. H., Donnellan, M.B., Moffitt, T. E., Robins, R. W., Poulton, R., & Caspi, A. (2006). Low Self-Esteem During Adolescence Predicts Poor Health, Criminal Behavior, and Limited Economic Prospects During Adulthood. \\"Developmental Psychology, 42\\" (2), 381-390.Trzesniewski, K. H., Donnellan, M.B., & Robins, R. W. (2003). Stability of Self-Esteem Across the Life Span. \\"Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 84\\" (1), 205-220. On the other side of the spectrum, individuals with low self-esteem suffer from poorer mental and physical health, including depressive symptoms and health problems; experience worse economic prospects, occasionally illustrate antisocial behavior and tend to exhibit higher levels of criminal behavior during adolescence. The research that Donnellan and his colleagues have done points to various macro factors in determining the correlation between low self-esteem and externalizing problems in a negative aspect. One suggestion is that low self-esteem weakens ties to society, thus decreasing conformity to social norms and increasing delinquency. Another suggestion is that a lack of unconditional positive self-regard, and/or low self-regard is linked with psychological problems, which includes aggression.Donnellan, M.B., Trzesniewski, K. H., Robins, R. W., Moffitt, T. E., & Caspi, A. (2005). Low Self-Esteem Is Related to Aggression, Antisocial Behavior, and Delinquency. \\"Psychological Science, 16\\" (4), 328-335. They have also taken a micro focus point of view in determining the relationship between low self-esteem and delinquent behavior. One point of view was to study the developmental processes involving person-environment transactions. It could be that an environmental or social influence forced the individual to act in certain ways, and it‚Äôs the environment that needs to be changed to have an eventual positive effect on the individual. Subsequently, there is also a parental support component that researchers have briefly looked at as a starting point for future instances of low self-esteem.

His contingent was the first to reach the Bazar Hotel. Afterwards, he participated in the seizure of the sappers‚Äô barracks in Wilda. On January 6, 1919, he took part in the seizure of the airbase in ≈Åawica in Pozna≈Ñ.  Activity after the Greater Poland Uprising  In April 1919, when the Greater Poland Uprising was over, Antoni Wysocki was nominated to the commander of II baon Stra≈ºy Ludowej (The Second Contingent of the People's Guard). Following the organizational changes, he moved to Obrona Krajowa (Domestic Defense). In June, he was nominated to the rank of second lieutenant. In the years 1919-1922 he served in the second contingent of the Domestic Defense and later formations of this contingent. Between 20 and 25 August 1920 he participated in the Second Silesian Uprising. On March 5, 1921, he was nominated to lieutenant. Between May 3 and July 5, 1921, he participated in the Third Silesian Uprising. In 1935 he was a junior department- officer in the department of control in the Greater Poland Military Museum in Pozna≈Ñ. He was a deputy director of Karol Marcinkowski and a very active member of the Greater Poland Uprising veterans‚Äô organizations. He published Zarys historii Towarzystw Powsta≈Ñc√≥w (‚ÄòThe Outline of the History of Insurgents Associations‚Äù) in Jednodni√≥wka Powsta≈Ñca Wielkopolskiego (The Insurgents Magazine).

W. Kellogg Company. Kellex was formed in 1942 so that Kellogg's operations relating to the Manhattan Project could be kept separate and secret. \\"Kell\\" stood for \\"Kellogg\\" and \\"X\\" for secret. The new company's goal was to design a facility for the production of enriched uranium through gaseous diffusion. In gaseous diffusion, isotopes of Uranium-235 could be separated from Uranium-238 by turning uranium metal into uranium hexafluoride gas and straining it through a barrier material. History The M. W. Kellogg Company, headquartered in Jersey City, NJ, specialized in chemical engineering projects. A year before the Manhattan Project began, the S-1 Section of the Office of Scientific Research and Development asked Kellogg to work with John R. Dunning and other scientists at Columbia University to ascertain the feasibility of gaseous diffusion. The pilot project at Kellogg was led by Percival C. \\"Dobie\\" Keith, vice-president of engineering at Kellogg, with A. L. Baker as Project Manager, and J. H. Arnold as Director of Research and Development. The work that Kellogg and Keith were doing on the pilot project made them obvious choices when the Manhattan Project looked for a company to create a production level processing plant. The newly formed Kellex company was headquartered in the Woolworth Building in Lower Manhattan, co-located with the New York Area Engineers Office, which oversaw the contract and the nearly one hundred Special Engineer Detachment personnel which had been assigned to the firm headquarters. Kellex facilities were also located at Columbia University's Nash Garage Building in New York City, in Decatur, Illinois, in Kellogg's Jersey City plant, and at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The K-25 building of the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant Kellex was charged with developing processes and equipment and to design the plant. Several technical challenges needed to be met before gas extraction techniques could be effectively applied to separation of uranium. Such a system would need an adequate porous barrier, a workable gas pump, and a pipe that could resist the corrosive effects of uranium hexafluoride gas. Scientists developed and tested different possible processes for uranium extraction at various locations. These included a pilot gaseous diffusion plant built at Columbia University in the Nash Garage Building at 3280 Broadway, New York, NY. Scientists and engineers were developing technology for the proposed production plant at the same time that architects were designing a building to house it. The project was known as K-25; \\"K\\" stood for Kellex while \\"25\\" was a common designation for uranium-235 during the Manhattan project. The K-25 production plant at the Clinton Engineer Works was built by the J. A. Jones Construction Company. The mile-long, U-shaped plant covered , was four stories high and contained hundreds of miles of specially coated, hermetically sealed pipes and equipment. The K-25 plant was the single most expensive facility of the Manhattan Project. Once built it was operated by the Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Corporation. In 1950, Kellex Corporation was acquired by Vitro Corporation.

HMS Powerful captured her during the Action of 9 July 1806. The British Royal Navy took her into service as HMS Bellona. Later, the Navy renamed her HMS Blanche. She was broken up in 1814.  Career   French privateer  Bellone was designed as a powerful privateer and was launched at Bordeaux in 1797. She was commissioned (or recommissioned) in November 1797 and under the command of one Pierre or Michel Destebetcho. =Atlantic= On 24 October Bellone encountered the American merchantman Washington at . Bellone attacked although Washington hoisted American colours. (This may have been a consequence of the Quasi-War.) The vessels exchanged fire over a four-hour period, including more than two hours of intense combat, with the result that both vessels sustained extensive damage to masts, sails, and rigging. Washington lost one man killed and had two men wounded. She went into Lisbon for repairs. There she found out that on the 27th or the 28th, Bellone had come into A Coru√±a for repairs after having unsuccessfully attacked an American ship. Bellone had suffered 37 dead and 28 wounded. The casualty disparity is surprising as Washington never was able to deploy more that 23 guns and had only 62 crew, whereas Bellona had twenty-six brass 12-pounder guns and four 32-pounder carronades, and 240 men.Leslie (1860), pp.2-14. Two of Washingtons 6-pounder guns were unavailable (one was stowed and one was foul), and in an initial exchange of broadsides, recoil dismounted five or six carronades; these the crew were able to remount during a lull in the engagement.Naval Documents... (1936), pp.315-8. However, throughout the engagement Bellona fired at Washingtons rigging, while Washington fired at Bellonas hull. =Indian Ocean= Bellone operated from Ile de France from 1801. In April 1801 she sailed on a cruize under the command of Jacques Fran√ßois Perroud. On his cruise he captured Amboina, Porcher, Tay, Saleh, John, Traveed, Farquhar, Mage, Pedro, and Farquhar.Piat (2007), p.99. On 3 April 1802 she returned to Port Louis. Farquhar had arrived the day before. Farquhar had a cargo of saltpetre, rice, cotton, sugar, indigo, Madeira wine, and muslin.Piat (2007), p.95. On 9 August 1803, Bellone captured Diamond as Diamond was returning to England after having delivered slaves to Havana. However, recaptured Diamond on 12 August and sent her into The Downs.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4378. On 14 August Bellone met the large East Indiaman Lord Nelson and managed to capture her by boarding. In June 1805 Bellone captured the whaler , Dunn, master, in a fight off Saint Helena. Coldstreams crew were landed there.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4245. Bellone captured the whaler near the Cape of Good Hope later in 1805, but gave her up.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4253. On 28 November 1805 Bellone attacked the East Indiaman , Captain George Saltwell. Saltwell dressed some of his seamen as soldiers, and rigged anti-boarding nets. In the ensuing single-ship action the French vessel was able to damage Admiral Gardners rigging and inflict casualties: Admiral Gardner had 10 men wounded, three severely. However, Bellone did not press the attack and by the next day she had disappeared. Bellones captain later told another EIC captain that he had veered off because he did not wish to risk his vessel being crippled. Bellone had 36 guns and 200 men to Admiral Gardners 26 guns and 120 men.Biden (1830), p.214. In the Action of 9 July 1806, the 74-gun ship of the line attacked Bellone. Bellone attempted to flee for almost two hours, trading shots with the much more potent opponent, before striking her colours. British casualties were two men killed and three wounded; French casualties were one man killed and six or seven men wounded. Perroud was commended for his spirited defence against overwhelming odds; William James, notably, described Perroud's actions as \\"extraordinary\\".James, p. 246  Royal Navy ship  After her capture, Bellone was incorporated in the Royal Navy as HMS Bellona, armed as a sixth- rate frigate of 28 guns.Naval Database Bellona was renamed HMS Blanche in 1809.

Background MacKenzie was born to Douglas MacKenzie and Lydia Ann Addison in Woodbridge, Ontario (today a district in the City of Vaughan) on a farm (Lot 5 Concession 7) that was originally a land grant to his great-grandfather (and settled by his grandfather William MacKenzie (1819-1904) in 1842). He was educated in Woodbridge and then worked at a variety of jobs across the country. In 1914, at the start of World War I, he enlisted in the 4th Battalion, Canadian Mounted Rifles and quickly rose to the rank of Major, due to his previous experience serving in the militia (The Governor General's Body Guard). During the Battle of the Somme, MacKenzie led a reconnaissance party to observe the effects of the artillery fire and later led his men and assaulted the Germans positions. His efforts that day would earn him the Military Cross. The citation read: \\"For conspicuous gallantry in action. He carried out a daring reconnaissance of the enemy's wire in daylight. Later he led his Company with great courage and determination, greatly assisting the bombers by sniping the enemy as they brought up reinforcements.\\" MacKenzie went on to participate in the Battle of Vimy Ridge, leading the 4th company. During the action he was hit by shrapnel from an artillery shell and was seriously wounded. After the battle, he praised the men of his command, \\"What I say about our Toronto boys is true in every other branch of the army. We fought Monday, not for cities, but for Canada. Every Canadian battalion did well.\\" His wounds were serious enough that he spent the rest of the war behind the front lines. He returned to farming after the war. Every Thanksgiving he held a turkey dinner for his neighbours. Politics He developed an interest in politics and served on Woodbridge Town Council before running for provincial office. He ran as the Progressive Conservative candidate in York North in 1943 but was defeated by CCF member, George Mitchell. In 1945 he ran again, this time defeating Mitchell. He served as a backbench member of the house for the next 22 years, finally retiring in 1967. He was not known as a strong speaker having made only two speeches but was remembered as a strong advocate for his riding constituents. Later life After retiring from politics, MacKenzie sat on the Board of the Metropolitan Toronto Conservation Authority and he was a charter member of the Woodbridge Horticultural Society. Just before his death he was on his way to Peel Memorial Hospital when his ambulance was slowed by a parade. Upon learning who was in the ambulance, the marching pipers insisted on escorting him to the hospital. In recognition of his long public serve, Major MacKenzie Drive, a main east-west thoroughfare in York Region, and Alexander MacKenzie High School, in Richmond Hill, Ontario, were named after him, as is Royal Canadian Legion Branch 414, in Woodbridge, Vaughan.

History  The exhibition of the Slovene Amateur Photographers' Club in the Jakopiƒç Pavilion in 2011 Jakopiƒç financed the construction of the building at his own expense, because he was convinced that an artist needs a constant contact with the public. Fabiani arranged plans for it gratuitously, and the city of Ljubljana leased him the estate at a symbolic price. The pavilion was built in the Vienna Secession style. It had a foyer with the great hall, on the left side it had a room for permanent exhibitions and a small studio, and on the right side it housed a drawing and painting school. The building was solemnly opened on 12 June 1909 with the 3rd Slovene Art Exhibition, which presented 172 paintings and 20 statues of 22 artists. The following year Jakopiƒç organised a survey exhibition titled 80 Years of Visual Arts in the Slovene Lands. Due to the lack of money, the pavilion was bought in 1923 by the city, which gave it to the National Gallery of Slovenia. In 1954 the pavilion was renovated.Bogo Zupanƒçiƒç.

The Free Cossacks are seen as precursors of the modern Ukrainian national law enforcement organizations such as the National Guard of Ukraine or the Internal Troops of Ukraine. The primary purpose of those militia formations was to provide security and civil order for the local population. The consolidation process of various smaller units started sometime in April near the town of Zvenyhorodka, Kiev Governorate during the local assembly of the Free Cossacks which created the Zvenyhorodka Kosh (battalion). The assembly elected Semen Hryzlo the Kosh Otaman, who became the otaman of Kalnyboloto Kurin (company). Under this title, he was delegated to the 2nd All-Ukrainian Military Congress in Kiev in June 1917. Hryzlo was also one of the organizers of the 1st All-Ukrainian Congress of the Free Cossacks that took place on October 3, 1917 in the former Cossack capital of Chyhyryn. The congress elected the Hetman of All Ukraine, who became General Pavlo Skoropadskyi. Hryzlo was elected as the General Yesaul. The Free Cossacks units distinguished themselves during the Ukrainian-Soviet War (particularly from December 1917 to April 1918) and were disbanded around May and June 1918. In January-April 1918 the Ukrainian government tried to create the Free Registered Cossack Troops for county security, but after the April coup-d'etat led by Pavlo Skoropadsky all Free Cossacks formations were officially dissolved.

It is located in the southwestern part of the Bispebjerg district. Although there are no clear borders nor any official demarcation, it is broadly recognized as the area covered mostly by the Danish postal code 2400 K√∏benhavn NV (NV being shorthand for Nordvest),Radio broadcast 2400 NV, sent 2011-01-31 20:03 on DR P1 in Danish although some areas lie outside this postal code. As of 2005, 44,177 people resided in the area.  History  A large area of the current Nordvest previously formed part of the Br√∏nsh√∏j-R√∏dovre municipality, which consisted mostly of low-density housing and small businesses. In the early 20th century, the Copenhagen municipality annexed the area from the Br√∏nsh√∏j-R√∏dovre municipality in order to construct a \\"socially democratic ideal where one can live from cradle to grave without moving more than a few blocks.\\" Consequently, in the following years a large number of social housing units and homeless shelters were constructed and soon populated by evicted residents from central Copenhagen (which was undergoing a housing \\"sanitization\\" during this time). Along with the construction of social housing, the area's readily available workforce also built small and large industrial complexes in the unused areas between the houses. This gave rise to the construction of different kinds of housing, such as the typografernes hus (lit.: typographer's housing), a type of housing in which residents live in the above-ground area and old, functional printing presses are housed in the basement. Throughout the 1980s, the Nordvest was increasingly characterized as an area for apartments, which were relatively inexpensive compared to those in the surrounding areas of Copenhagen. In 1980, the area was designated by the community psychiatric authorities to house people with mental health diagnoses in the community. However, soon thereafter there was a spike in vandalism and assaults. In 1993, the Ministry of Housing, the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the Copenhagen municipality agreed on a \\"holistic effort in the Nordvest\\" to improve the situation. This would later serve as a model and precursor for later area improvement projects elsewhere in Denmark. By 2013, the area had experienced a partial urban regeneration, characterized by an ethnically diverse population and a wide range of small businesses, while the industrial complexes were largely renovated and converted to modern housing. A film on the subject was directed by Michael Noer.  Characteristics and attractions  The area is bordered (from the north, clockwise) by the remaining part of Bispebjerg, the districts √òsterbro and N√∏rrebro, the municipality of Frederiksberg, and the districts Vanl√∏se and Br√∏nsh√∏j-Husum. The major roads Tagensvej, Frederiksborgvej, Tuborgvej/Tomsg√•rdsvej/Hjulg√•rdsvej, Borups All√©, and Hiller√∏dgade all cut through Nordvest. Two large green areas can be found in the area: Utterslev Mose is the northwest border of the area, and the Bispebjerg Kirkeg√•rd cemetery is near the center. Smaller green areas include the Emaljehaven (lit.: the Enamel Garden), a renovated green area that previously housed a large metal workshop, R√∏dkilde park (lit.: The Red Source park), which hosts the R√∏dkilde Nature Playground and the Nordvestparken (lit.: the North West park), constructed in 2009, which won the Danish Light Award in 2010. The earlier social housing and industrial buildings have undergone a transformation: while many of the old buildings are still standing, they have been repurposed. Most of the old buildings have not been modernized, and only some have been partially modernized. With the relocation of much of the industry to less populated areas, the old industrial complexes provide an opportunity for modern housing and activities. One such example of the modernization of the old Ungdomshuset area was the creation of a large cultural creativity space, Boljefabrikken (lit. the candy factory), housed in an old smithy and plumbing factory. The area's rugged image persists, and because of this it has acquired the nicknames Nordv√¶rst (North Worst) and Nordl√¶dervest (North Leather Vest). As a result, housing costs are comparatively lower than other areas of Copenhagen; in the neighboring district of √òsterbro and the neighboring municipality of Frederiksberg, housing prices are on average 50% higher than in Nordvest. Crime rates, however, are the same as in most of urban Copenhagen. Even though the area is formally a part of the district Bispebjerg, the Nordvest is often associated with the district N√∏rrebro, and Copenhagen municipality is actively creating a more pervasive integration of Nordvest and N√∏rrebro.

Tory Higgins and Arie Kruglanski who are interested in the development of goal-pursuit as well as motivation. The theory depicts two main approaches to situations using locomotion and assessment. Background The regulatory mode theory depicts how people approach situations to achieve the goal. This theory is part of E. Tory Higgins research in motivation theories and goal pursuit theories. People can either use the locomotion or the assessment method for goal-pursuit. E. Tory Higgins states, \\"When people self-regulate they decide what they want that they don‚Äôt currently have. They then figure out what they need to do to get what they want, and then they do it.\\" People who are geared towards the locomotion mode are focused on moving and getting things done. In contrast, those that are strong in assessment will compare different goals and analyze different options. Locomotion and assessment A study done by Pierro, Giacomantonio, Pica, Kruglanski, and Higgins (2011) examined the ways locomotion and assessment affects procrastination and how people manage time. The study found that assessment is positively related to procrastination and locomotion is negatively related to procrastination. To reach a certain goal, assessors have to analyze and compare a large amount of work. However, the locomotors were generally quicker to make decisions and act on them. The study emphasized that assessment orientation evaluates and analyzes in such detail that they delay making the decision quickly. Yet for the assessment-oriented individuals, they were more accurate in their decisions even though they took a longer time. These two regulatory modes reflect motivational styles for goal-pursuit. The motivation behind the assessment mode is accuracy and for locomotion mode it is action. Promoting value A person's regulatory mode is correlated with regulatory fitness. They display their optimal level of performance in addition to valuing the end goals. In Avnet and Higgin's study (2004), the participants paid more for the book-light when their decisions were based on their regulatory orientation‚Äîeither locomotion or assessment. They demonstrated that the value of the book-light is dependent on their approach systems. Motivation Consequently, locomotion can be very efficient in maintaining attitude, creating intention, and facilitating behavior. Mannetti, Pierro, Higgins, and Kruglanski (2012) investigated peoples' commitment to exercising at the gym and how regularly they went. They evaluated the participants' regulatory mode using a questionnaire and then their attendance was recorded in a 6-month period. Results show that when the people had high locomotion concerns and they had positive attitudes about physical exercise, their intentions to engage in physical exercise were high. They would proceed to actually engage in physical exercise within the 6-month period. Since locomotion runs on the motivation to do and to act, the positive effects of making a behavior happen can be expanded to other areas.

Of the book and her writing in general, Perkins has stated that she wears a different scent for each book that she writes and that she wore lychee rose while writing Anna and the French Kiss. Plot Anna Oliphant is a senior in high school who is forced by her father to attend the fictional boarding school 'School of America in Paris' ‚Äì nicknamed SOAP by students. She is heavily against having to leave Atlanta for Paris, specifically due to leaving her best friend, Bridgette, and Toph, her almost boyfriend, who worked with her in a multiplex and the two shared a kiss before her leaving for Paris. Anna wants to become a film critic, being a major movie fan. On her first night at SOAP, she meets her neighbor Meredith (Mer), who consoles her after finding Anna crying in her room. After Anna leaves Meredith's room, she bumps into a beautiful boy who introduces himself as √âtienne St. Clair, and has an English accent. The next morning at breakfast, Mer invites Anna to sit with her and her friends; Rashmi and boyfriend Josh, as well as √âtienne from the night before ‚Äì he is known by everyone as St. Clair. St. Clair has a girlfriend, Ellen, who used to be in the group before she graduated SOAP. Anna can neither read nor speak French, and feels inferior among her classmates, leading to St. Clair's assistance in ordering breakfast. She notices St. Clair's popularity amongst the students, mainly as a result of his natural charm. St. Clair and Anna are appointed as lab partners for the remainder of the year. Anna discovers she is the only senior in Beginning French, except for a junior named Dave. Anna learns that Mer has a crush on St. Clair on which she can't act, because of his girlfriend. After a week in SOAP Josh, Rashmi, St. Clair and Mer is surprised to learn that Anna hasn't yet gone out of campus to explore Paris. She is more than happy when St. Clair takes her out to explore Paris. They talk, laugh, visit point zero of France and bond more. St. Clair learns about Toph, and Anna meets his girlfriend \\"Ellie\\" for the first time. she reminds herself despite of her attraction towards St. Clair that he's taken and nothing can happen between them. Over the next few weeks Anna and St. Clair become best friends, he doodles on her homework, sits next to her at every meal, teases her about her sneakers, asks about her favorite films, and conjugates her French homework. But Anna knows she wants more... and St. Clair doesn't seem to be denying that there is something growing between them, something more than friendship. One day, when the group was hanging out in a cemetery, St. Clair learns that her mother is dying due to cervical cervical cancer, and his father doesn't want him to meet her. St. Clair gets drunk later that night, and confesses her liking for Anna. Anna worries about St. Clair and seeing a cheerful and kind boy go quiet makes her heart sink. The group tries to cheer him up, and Anna lies to St. Clair when he asked if he said something to her when he was drunk. All the students and their friends leave for Thanksgiving, leaving Anna and St. Clair alone, because their Fathers refused to have them home. Anna tries her best to cheer a bed stricken St. Clair to celebrate Thanksgiving and stop sulking by convincing him that her mother wouldn't want to see him like that. Her efforts worked out, and St. Clair relaxed a bit with her company. At night, he requested Anna to let him sleep with her, not wanting to be alone. The duo never grew intimate, fearing it will ruin their friendship. Anna goes back to Atlanta, and St. Clair meets her mother. She comes to know her best friend Bridge and Toph had been secretly dating each other and neither cared to tell her that.

Soon, St. Clair's mother announced that she is Cancer free, much to his delight. The group went out to celebrate, where Anna and St. Clair kissed in the Park. But things didn't go well when Mer saw them kissing each other, St. Clair running back to Ellie and Anna's fight with Amanda when she abused Mer. She yelled at St. Clair before he could explain, and stopped talking to the group, assuming that everyone hates her. Coincidentally, when Anna and St. Clair were put together for detention he explains Anna that he went back to Ellie to break up with her. Anna determined to set things right, sends a letter to her best friend Bridge, reconciles with her friends, apologise to Mer, who says she and St. Clair is perfect for each other and she was just in denial to admit this to herself. Later, Anna goes to Notre dame where √âtienne follows her all the way up, despite his fear for heights, to confess that he's in Love with her. He confronted Anna asking her why did she lie when he asked her about that night he drunkenly confessed his feelings.

At a young age, he was very naughty and did not focus in school. In order to get into secondary school, he had to pass an exam, making it a hindrance to him. Nevertheless, he persevered and passed the exam on the sixth attempt. When he was around fourteen years old in 1958, he moved to Hong Kong and continued his studies.Chan, Wai Man (2012-12-08). Obsession with Paper. (Á¥ôÈÜâÁîòËø∑ÔºöÊåáÈÅéÁ¥ôÁôÆ) Apple daily. Right after graduating from a secondary school, he studied business administration for a year and moved to Chinese literature. Eventually, he ended his undergraduate studies because his family objected to it, and he began to work. At first, he worked at his cousin's watch company. He then worked as a quality control checker in a garment factory, followed by a debt collector in a stationery wholesale company, then a delivery courier. It was during this time that he started doing paper-tearing. According to him, working as a local delivery courier was toilsome, but delighting. He usually gave out his paper-tearing artwork to the companies while delivering goods to them. Of course, he was very pleased to see the companies decorating their offices with his creations. Wat Charlotte (2009, p.2). Tear out a new. Soon he became famous for paper-tearing. Consequently, he resigned the job of delivery courier due to increasing paper- tearing lessons, performances and voluntary work, and he started to concentrate on promoting paper-tearing art. 1983-1999: paper-tearing Uncle Man's work During the Lunar New Year's Eve in 1983, Uncle Man created his first paper-tearing work. It was composed of the two Chinese characters \\"Dai Kat\\" (Â§ßÂêâ), which means an expectation of a great fortune. Remarkably, he made it out of boredom with no one teaching him. Although the artwork was appreciated by his relatives, he did not have great affections towards paper- tearing at that moment. It was only after he created his second paper-tearing piece during his work as a delivery man that he started to practice his skill. His second work was interpreted as \\"A million gold pieces\\". Afterwards, he started giving his artwork to his friends as gifts. Uncle Man tears paper according to the order of strokes of the word. He practices by adding symmetrical features to words, figures and even three-dimensional words. In fact, in order to promote paper-tearing skills, he made a lot of effort to decrease the number of steps and have fun at the same time, so that even a two-year-old child can both learn and enjoy making them. \\"Lifetime art\\" Ëóù‰º¥‰∏ÄÁîü [JET] 2012-06-01 P132-153 FEATURE STORY Lap Wong He usually uses recycled paper for his artwork in the hopes of protecting the environment and making paper-tearing popularized.

He found out that the Kowloon Walled City Park is a nice place for him to perform the paper craft art since there are a lot of tourists.Lifetime Art(Ëóù‰º¥‰∏ÄÁîü ) [JET] 2012-06-01 P132-153 FEATURE STORY Lap Wong The staff in the park encouraged him to apply for a stall demonstration in Tsim Sha Tsui, which was organized by the Hong Kong Cultural Centre. The application was successful and he eventually started working there. On his first day of the demonstration, he displayed his first masterpiece. It was composed of four Chinese characters \\"ÁÑ°Ë®ÄÊÑüÊøÄ\\", representing his speechless gratefulness to the staff of the park due to their unlimited support, as well as the opportunity to promote the paper-tearing art. Consequently, his artwork has attracted more and more public attention; more people and media have come to find him and learn more about his work. Others also conducted interviews with him and invited him for performances. He has performed and demonstrated paper craft art in Kowloon Walled City, Hong Kong Cultural Center, Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong, and Star Ferry, as well as in various restaurants, schools, hospitals and community centers.

Built in 1928, the hotel is the largest building in Merced. The hotel's architecture reflects the transitional design common in 1920s hotels, which were moving away from the Classical Revival designs used in hotels in the past. In addition, the building boasted Merced's first neon sign. The Tioga Hotel was a grand hotel which hosted prominent guests, including Eleanor Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge, Mary Pickford, and various foreign royalty. During World War II, the hotel played a role in the war effort; the U.S. Air Force used a floor of the building for offices, and various organizations held wartime fundraisers in its lobby and ballrooms. After the war, manager Gyle Miller returned the hotel to its former prominence; in the following decades, the hotel hosted film stars and served as a center for agricultural trade. The rise of automobile travel ultimately led to the hotel's decline, and it was converted to a residential apartment building. The Tioga Hotel was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 3, 1980. In 2011, financial discrepancies were discovered resulting in a discovery of an embezzlement operation and the arrest of the property manager, James M. Hiestand. After being taken over by new management In 2012, it was revealed that a massive cockroach infestation had taken over the hotel prompting residents to form a union and threaten a lawsuit if nothing was done. In response, the hotel temporarily seized the renewing of any leases for residents as well as the leases of the neighboring shops who rent space on the ground floor. In April 2018, a $15 million renovation project began that will transform the building back into the hotel it once was.

It was a key component of Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom.  Prelude  At the Battle of Svensksund, the Swedes broke the naval stalemate with their Russian opponents and won a spectacular victory by engaging the Archipelago fleet, a flotilla of galleys, prams and gunboats. With the French Navy weakened by the Glorious First of June, a strategic victory with a crushing tactical cost, and incapable of challenging the Royal Navy head-on since the Croisi√®re du Grand Hiver, the concept of a rush across the English Channel to invade England gained traction. The plans of the ships designed by Chapman were transmitted to Forfait by JJ.Muskeyn in 1796. On 10 October 1794, the Committee of Public Safety created a first draft of the flotilla. On 25 December 1797, the French Directory appointed General Napol√©on Bonaparte to the head of the Arm√©e d'Angleterre.  The Flotilla  In a decree of 12 July 1801, the flotilla was organised into nine divisions.Gallois, p.352 It comprised several types of ship: * the bateau canonnier, a small two-masted Fore-and-aft rigged gunboat carrying one large gun Projet de construction Bateau Canonnier de la flottille de Boulogne 1803Contexte historique Bateau Canonnier de la flottille de Boulogne 1803 * the chaloupe canonni√®re (or simply \\"canonni√®re\\"), a small brig * the Balancelle * the \\"Prame\\", a flat-hulled barge In the summer, the British under Horatio Nelson launched a series of Raids on Boulogne, with a first attempt on 4 August, and another on 15‚Äì16. French admiral Latouche-Tr√©ville organised a successful defence that derailed the attacks. The Treaty of Amiens of 25 March 1802 suspended the activity of the flotilla, but it was reactivated at the outbreak of the War of the Third Coalition in May 1803. Bonaparte reorganised the flotilla, which was regularly attacked by British forces with little effect ; on a background of constant harassing actions between small French and British ships, the flotilla achieved some limited victories against larger British units, such as the Capture of HMS Minerve on 2 July 1803 off Cherbourg, or the Action of 15 July 1805. On 3 October 1804, a British force under Lord Keith attempted to destroy the flotilla using 25 fireships, which were repelled.Gallois, p.427 The attempt was renewed on 9 October 1806 using Congreve rockets, and the next days by gunfire, with no effect.Gallois, p.461  Sources and references   Notes   References   Bibliography  * Category:French military units and formations of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom Category:Armies of Napoleonic Wars ","title":"Flottille de Boulogne"},{"id":"39079497","text":"Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Putrajaya Presint 8 (1) is a secondary school situated in Putrajaya, Wilayah Persekutuan, Malaysia.

One of the brightest examples of the phenomenon known as \\"village otamans\\". He and his people from time to time conflicted almost with all major military-political forces of that day Ukraine. Biography Early years Danylo Ilovych Terpylo was born on December 28, 1886 in Trypillia, where he was educated first by the church- parish school and then at a Zemstvo school. During the 1905 Russian Revolution he became a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party. Terpylo was first arrested in 1907 and stayed in prison for three months. He was arrested a second time on September 22, 1908, for anti-government activity, and sent to the Arkhangelsk Oblast for three years. In 1914-1917 he was mobilized into the Russian army, participating in the First World War. He served on the Western Front at the headquarters of the XXXV Corps. During the February Revolution, he returned to Ukraine. In 1917 he studied at the Zhytomyr school of ensigns.Renata Field. Memories of the Cossacks After the October Revolution, the Trypillians recognized the authority of the Central Rada. The Trypillian organization of socialist-revolutionaries had a great influence on the outskirts of Trypillia, Chernyakhiv, Hermanivka and Obukhiv. At that time, Danylo and his comrades were laying the network of the future insurgent movement: the structure of the army, the weapons, the places of assembly and everything else that is included in the concept of mobilization readiness. Against the hetman In March 1918, the German Empire and troops of the Ukrainian State came to Trypillia. The liberal-minded Ukrainian intelligentsia took a stance against the imperialist-backed Hetmanate, as did Terpylo. In November 1918, he participated in the rebellion against the Hetmanate in Trypillia. On November 21, Terpylo's troops defeated the Trypillian hetman. At that time, his detachment was made up of 4000 peasants. In November 1918, he created a three-thousand-strong rebel division, which together with the troops of Petliura and the Sich Riflemen, occupied Kiev in December 1918. Against Petliura However, once victorious, Petliura ordered Terpylo to dissolve his division. Instead, he revolted, refusing to continue fighting for the Ukrainian People's Republic. At the beginning of January 1919 factions emerged from among the parties that were part of the Government of the Directory: from the independentist Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party to the Left SRs, who favoured closer ties to the USSR. Though they all recognized Soviet power in Ukraine. In Trypillia, at the peasant cossack congress, Terpylo stated that his aspirations were at odds with the Directory's policy and he was confronting it. After the congress, the rebels of the surrounding townships began to gather in Trypillia. A few days later, a second congress was convened, to which 80 delegates arrived. The congress elected a county executive committee and elected Terpylo as commander of the Green Army. On January 22, 1919, a detachment of Sich Riflemen was sent from Kiev to suppress Terpylo's rebellion. After Trotsky ordered the reorganization of Green units along the undemocratic structure of the Red Army, Terpylo turned against them too. Against the Bolsheviks On February 5, 1919, the Bolsheviks occupied Kiev. In April 1919, relying on the support of the population, Terpylo began a fight against the Russian occupying power, which in March declared the Green movement outlawed. The Green army occupied Trypillia and killed the Bolshevik agitators there. Terpylo formed part of the underground All-Ukrainian Revolutionary Committee and became the military commissioner of the Revolutionary War. In his address \\"To the peasants and workers of Ukraine\\", Terpylo emphasized: \\"We are striving for this: Ukraine must be independent...\\". On April 8-10, 1919 Terpylo briefly occupied Kiev, supporting a socialist uprising against the Bolsheviks, largely paralyzing the Bolshevik structures in the city. The Green detachments were named ‚ÄúFirst Kiev Soviet Division‚Äù. And already in the summer the rural areas surrounding Kiev completely passed into the hands of the rebels. In early May, the Green Army was defeated by the Bolsheviks in Chernihiv. In May 1919, Bolshevik authorities threw a rebel detachment of 21,000 Red Army soldiers against the rebels. The Reds launched even the Dnieper Flotilla against the rebels. By May 14-16, Terpylo was expelled from the area, and his army dispersed - reduced to two thousand, and broken up into small detachments. At the end of May 1919, the Council of People's Commissars of Ukraine announced a reward for Terpylo's head, dead or alive, in the amount of 50 thousand rubles. At the beginning of June 1919, Green moved to the left bank of the Dnieper, where they fought a guerilla war against the Bolsheviks. In Pereyaslav, on July 15, 1919, in the presence of the local people and his army, Terpylo canceled the Pereyaslav Agreement for \\"reunification\\" with Moscow. At this time, his strength was measured by about 30 thousand Cossacks. Terpylo's troops committed numerous pogroms. Elias Heifetz estimates that Zelenyy's troops killed about 2,000 people in 15 pogroms.Elias Heifetz, The Slaughter of the Jews in the Ukraine in 1919, pp. 177-178. Against Denikin On August 31, 1919, Denikin's White Army captured Kiev. On September 17, 1919, Terpylo arrived at Kamyanets- Podilsky with one of the detachments, he personally met with Symon Petliura. The rebels demanded the provision of ammunition and the immediate start of the offensive against Denikin. Afterwards, Terpylo held an assembly with his troops, which approved the recognition of the Ukrainian Directory. Throughout the autumn, the Terpylo fought with the Denikinites, leading a large guerrilla army that numbered up to 30,000 soldiers. The area of activity of the guerrilla green detachments was the Chyhyryn, Cherkasy, Kaniv and Zvenigorod counties. The Greens kicked Denikin out of the area, and on October 11, 1919, they again managed to capture Kiev for a while. In October 1919, the Greens entered into a battle with the Whites near Kanev and were badly wounded. Danylo Ilkovych Terpylov died on the way back to Trypillia, where he was buried along the bank of the river Donets. His tomb was not preserved.

It was created in 1996 in Kentucky to provide an alternative to the traditional religiously affiliated summer camps, for the children of nontheistic, humanist or freethinking families as well as children from a religious upbringing. Camp Quest currently consists of 13 affiliated camp groups and its current Executive Director is Kim Newton. Formation In 1995, at a meeting of the Council of Democratic and Secular Humanism in upstate New York, in response to the exclusion of non-religious children from the Boy Scouts of America and their camps, the idea for a secular summer camp for children of non-theistic and atheist families was proposed. Edwin Kagin, attending the meeting as a representative of the Free Inquiry Group of Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky (FIG), brought the idea back to FIG and the group determined to actually do it, the planning committee chaired by Vern Uchtman.http://www.campquest.org/history Kagin was selected to become the camp's first director due to his having been an Eagle Scout when younger. Kagin's wife Helen Kagin and other members of FIG also took various roles at the camp. The name Camp Quest was chosen, the letters representing http://www.campquest.org\\"Question, Understand, Explore, Search, Test.\\" The Morse Code for CQ (wireless call for \\"Seek You') also became a symbol on caps and shirts for the camp. On August 11, 1996 the first camp took place in premises owned by Bullittsburg Baptist Church in Boone County, Kentucky with 20 children attending. In 1999 Camp Quest moved to a nearby YMCA camp in Ohio, Camp Kern, at which the Northern Kentucky Baptist Association then sought the legal right to restrict the use of their campgrounds based on religious beliefs. At their request, then-Kentucky Representative Tom Kerr sponsored legislation (House Bill 70) exempting religious organizations from anti- discrimination requirements of public accommodation laws. His legislation was not successful and the bill was passed over in 2000. Camp Quest Inc. In 2000 Camp Quest expanded with independent camps operating across the United States with the same mission statement, becoming Camp Quest Inc., an independent educational non-profit organization, in 2007 with Fred Edwords as its first president. Camp Quest Inc. now serves as an umbrella group for all Camp Quest affiliates in North America. Edwin and Helen Kagin continued as co- directors of the original Camp Quest based in Ohio until their retirement in 2005. The original Camp Quest moved to 4-H Camp Graham in Clarksville, Ohio, its current location. The first affiliated group to begin operating a second Camp Quest summer camp session was the Rationalists of East Tennessee, which hosted its first camp session in Tennessee under the name Camp Quest of the Smoky Mountains in 2002. in 2009 Camp Quest expanded outside North America with Camp Quest UK launching in the United Kingdom. Current Camp Quest UK director, Samantha Stein, became a volunteer for the organisation at a camp in Michigan and was prompted to start a camp in the UK with a group of volunteers. The first UK camp was supported by a grant from the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, and was held in Somerset. Stein fielded a considerable amount of press interest when the Sunday Times broadsheet newspaper ran a front-page article on Camp Quest UK with the headline 'Dawkins sets up kids‚Äô camp to groom atheists'. The Times later went on to include it in their Best kids camps in Britain and 10 best kids' adventure holidays. CQUK also received support from the Humanists UK. Camp Quest Norway launched in 2011 followed by Camp Quest Switzerland in 2013. Camp Quest Ireland was held as a two-day gathering in Dublin in 2010. Programs and activities Most camps' activities include traditional summer camp events: campfires, singing, crafts, games, swimming, canoeing and archery. Other activities explore science and nature and might include meteorology, astronomy, evolution or building rockets. Campers are also encouraged to explore mythology and philosophy, including discussing ethics in a camp version of Socrates Cafe. Campers might also learn American Sign Language, do drama or learn to build a radio. All the programs aim to introduce campers between the age of 8 and 17 to critical thinking, logic and freethought. As of 2017 Camp Quest has expressed that it will not segregate activities by gender and has introduced policies to accommodate non binary gender and transgender campers and staff. Invisible unicorn challenge During Camp Quest attendees are tasked with the invisible unicorn challenge, aimed at showing that a negative cannot be proven. The task is one of the ways used to encourage children to exercise logic and explore ideas about the burden of proof and challenges the children to prove that invisible unicorns do not exist. The children are told that two invisible unicorns exist at Camp Quest and that there is a valuable book proving their existence which has been passed from generation to generation but no one is allowed to read. Any camper who can prove that the unicorns do not exist will win a godless one-hundred dollar bill (issued before 1957, the year the U.S. Congress mandated that \\"In God We Trust\\" be printed on American fiat currency.) In the UK the prize is a ¬£10 note signed by Richard Dawkins. Since first offering this challenge in August 1996, the prize remains unclaimed.

It covers the Penmachno Valley, through which runs the Afon Machno, and includes the villages of Penmachno and Cwm Penmachno. To the south west borders Gwynedd, and is located south of Betws-y- Coed, north west of Corwen, and south of Conwy. The whole of the community is within the Snowdonia national park, while much of it forms part of Gwydir Forest. According to the 2011 census, the population of the Bro Machno Parish was 617, of whom 342 (55%) were able to speak Welsh and 214 (34%) had no skills in Welsh. T≈∑ Mawr T≈∑ Mawr, a 16th-century farmhouse now owned by the National Trust, was the birthplace of William Morgan, who in 1588 first translated the whole Bible into Welsh. The building is Grade II* listed. Also listed is Coed-y-Ffynnon Farmhouse, where the poet Huw Machno died in 1637, Benar Farmhouse, below Penmachno and dating from the 16th century, Fedw Deg, a 16th-century old house in the north of the community, and Pen-y-Bryn Farmhouse, a 17th-century building overlooking the village. The Penmachno Document was drawn up by Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294, at the height of his rebellion against Edward I of England. It is the only surviving document issued by one of the Welsh leaders during the revolt, and in it Madog styles himself Prince of Wales, Lord of Snowdonia. At the head of the valley stands the village of Cwm Penmachno, above which Penmachno and Rhiwbach slate quarries opened at the start of the 19th century. By the 1860s, underground quarrying was being developed, later covering eight levels. Horses carried the slate down the Penmachno and Conwy valleys to Trefriw, until the Rhiwbach Tramway opened in 1863, when all the slate from the Rhiwbach quarry was transported to Blaenau Ffestiniog, to be carried by the Ffestiniog Railway to the harbour at Porthmadog. The Penmachno quarry continued to ship its slate out by road until it closed in 1962. Because of the remoteness, and inaccessibility during bad weather, of Rhiwbach quarry, the workers lived on site, and a small village developed, including a shop and school, in addition to family accommodation and a barracks for single men. Extensive remains of the village can still be seen, along with the ruins of the engine house which provided the power to haul the slate up the incline to the tramway. At the opposite end of the valley stands the former Penmachno Woollen Mill, a 19th- century water-powered fulling mill. The community is part of the Uwch Conwy ward for elections to Conwy County Borough Council.

As a result of the Greek War of Independence, which had begun in 1821, and the Great Powers' intervention in the conflict after the Treaty of London in the Battle of Navarino (1827), the creation of some form of Greek state in southern Greece had become certain. In 1827, the Greek Third National Assembly entrusted the governance of the fledgling nation to Ioannis Kapodistrias, who arrived in Greece in January 1828. Alongside his efforts to lay the foundations for a modern state, Kapodistrias undertook negotiations with the Great Powers as to the extent and constitutional status of the new Greek state, especially during the Poros Conference of the Great Powers' ambassadors in September 1828. Although the ambassadors recommended a broad territorial basis for the new Greek state, in November 1828, disregarding the ambassadors' recommendations, the Great Powers agreed on the first London Protocol, which created an autonomous Greek state, which would be tributary to the Sultan and limited to the Peloponnese (Morea) and the Cyclades islands. This left out Central Greece, Crete, and other islands which had participated in the Greek uprising and/or were at the time under Greek control. In the event, the Protocol was amended on 22 March 1829 by the signature of the second London Protocol, which largely accepted the Poros Conference's recommendations.

The firm specialised in rolltop desks and was granted seven patents related to the desk's mechanism. The company was known as 'Cutler & Son' by the 1870s and exhibited some desks at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition. By the early 1900s, the firm was known as the 'Cutler Desk Co.' In 1930 it was taken over by the Sikes Chair Co., also of Buffalo.http://deepinthewoods.me/doc/Tree041812/wc09/wc09_403.htm The US Patent Office issued a patent for the first American-made rolltop desk to Abner Cutler of Buffalo, NY in 1882.https://www.google.com/patents/US260950?dq=Cutler&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjlxuOlxtTWAhVGKyYKHZCODO8Q6wEIKTAA Similar desks had been seen in the United States and Europe before Cutler's patent. The cylinder desk was a predecessor of the rolltop, and had been in use in Europe in the 1700s, but warping of the top was common as it was made from a single piece of wood. The tambour desk may also be considered an early rolltop even though the work surface was only partly covered by the top. The rolltop became a standard item of the Victorian office. Cutler's company flourished until around 1919, when the rolltop design declined in popularity and was replaced by Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles. Abner Cutler was born at Paris, Oneida County, N. Y., in 1802 and was the sixth child of Joseph and Dothea Judd. He spent his childhood on a farm and when sixteen years old was apprenticed for three years to Silas Sikes, a cabinet maker of Clinton, New York. After this he was employed by Thomas Constantine in New York where he learnt the trade of cabinet-making. From there he worked in Chittenango, New York, and in 1824 started out on his own. He went into partnership with a Mr. Stearns of Mendon, New York, and they established themselves as cabinet makers at Black Rock near Buffalo, and were soon marketing \\"fall-leaf\\" tables.https://archive.org/stream/cutlermemorialge00cutl/cutlermemorialge00cutl_djvu.txt Marriage and children The founder of the firm, Abner Cutler (1802 - 29 May 1891, Buffalo, New York), was the son of Joseph Cutler (1748-1827) and Dothea Judd (1760-1833). His first wife, whom he married on 21 January 1828 in Paris, New York, was Lydia Grey (1808-1873) and their son Frederick Hudson Cutler (1843-1897), one of seven children, was a partner in the firm.

Following a review, new electoral division boundaries were introduced for this election, increasing the number of councillors from 80 to 81. All locally registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) who were aged 18 or over on Thursday 2 May 2013 were entitled to vote in the local elections. Those who were temporarily away from their ordinary address (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) were also entitled to vote in the local elections, although those who had moved abroad and registered as overseas electors cannot vote in the local elections. It is possible to register to vote at more than one address (such as a university student who had a term- time address and lives at home during holidays) at the discretion of the local Electoral Register Office, but it remains an offence to vote more than once in the same local government election.

Electoral Review For these elections the number of seats in the Council increased from 80 to 81 implementing, with a minor change, recommendations of the 2010 review by the Local Government Boundary Commission for England.lgbce.org All reviews: South East: Surrey. Retrieved 2013-05-05 During the consultation the Council in November 2010 recommended no change to the number of councillors and most submissions recommended a reduction in the number of councillors, including a representation from Surrey Heath District Council to reduce the number of councillors to 60. However, when the Council drafted its boundary proposals it realised that allocation of 8 members to Waverley District would mean: Therefore, although the threshold for electoral inequality is 10% variation from the average, which must be reached in 33% of divisions to trigger a boundary commission review, the Council relied in evidence on the fact that Waverley's projected electorate in 2016 would be the most disparate above the quota. Others were over-represented falling below the quota and opponents argued for instead, their removal. Determined to keep a minimum of 80 councillors, Surrey County Council stated that Waverley would be, in its view, unacceptably under-represented and so advocated 81 seats in its final, modified size submission of March 2011.lgbce.org \\"Surrey Council size submissions.\\" Retrieved 2013-05-05 The LGBCE accepted this argument. The boundary review resulted generally to minor revisions all of which were only to a minority of divisions, with consequential name changes in a few instances.

He was the youngest decorated soldier in the Army of Republika Srpska. Life Gostiƒá was born on 14 August 1978 in Doboj, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia. He attended elementary school in Maglaj but due to the outbreak of war in Bosnia, he didn't graduate. At a very young age he was left without his father. In 1992 (the first year of the war), he lived with his mother Milena in the village of Joviƒái near Maglaj. The village was surrounded with smaller towns with a majority Bosniak population. Gostiƒá thus found himself on the front-lines. In April 1992, his mother died so he went to live with his grandmother. His grandmother was killed in September 1992 during the bombing of the village by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). As a soldier Shortly after this, Gostiƒá joined the Army of Republika Srpska, where he started off as a military courier. After this he was transferred to the duty of delivering food to soldiers on the front-lines. While going about his duties upon horse, he fell into a mine field. The horses succumbed to the mines but Gostiƒá was not seriously wounded. He would later go on to be wounded again. In the ARBiH offensive on mount Ozren, the local population retreated from Joviƒái but Gostiƒá remained with a few soldiers to defend the village. In March 1993, during the bombing of the checkpoints of the Serb army, five soldiers were killed and Gostiƒá was seriously wounded. Gostiƒá died of his injuries on 20 March 1993 in Joviƒái on mount Ozren at the age of 14. He was buried along with his fallen peers in the cemetery in Gornji Uli≈°njak.

Our sister killjoy. London: Longman, 1977\\" (review), World Literature Written in English, Volume 17, 1978 - Issue 1, pp. 55‚Äì57; via Taylor & Francis Online. It has been called \\"a witty, experimental work whose main point is a stylish dismissal of characteristic attitudes of both the white world and the black middle class.\\"Faith Pullin, British Book News; quoted in Hans M. Zell, Carol Bundy & Virginia Coulon (eds), A New Reader's Guide to African Literature, Heinemann Educational Books, 1983, p. 128. It was described by one reviewer as \\"a strikingly unusual and pertinent commentary on the African encounter with the West, on European soil.... Without being a conventional narrative or biography, it is a text that uses the framework of an account of a state-sponsored visit to Germany by a young Ghanaian woman (the 'Sister' of the title, usually addressed as 'Sissie') to analyse what Europe is and does to those Africans whom it 'sponsors' and educates.\\"Annie Gagiano, \\"Our Sister Killjoy\\" (review), LitNet. Summary Our Sister Killjoy is about a young African woman named Sissie who goes to Europe to \\"better\\" herself (with European education) as described by her African counterparts. The novel revolves around themes of black diaspora and colonialism, in particular colonization of the mind. Sissie observes the other Africans who have emigrated (also for education and the desire for a better life in Europe) and sees them as \\"sell-outs\\" who have forgotten their culture and their motherland. Aidoo touches on the effects of post-colonialism and how the traditions and thoughts of the colonizer are instilled into the minds of the colonized. Sissie in the novel represents the need to have a connection to one's past. Aidoo is critical of Africans' adulation of Europeans. The first thing Sissie notices upon going into the town in Germany are shiny and glittery material possessions. Aidoo critiques the way some Africans buy into the notion of white superiority, by turning to Europe when they are looking for the \\"best,\\" whether in education or material possessions. The orientation toward Europe and the investment in whiteness begins in Africa and continues and is reinforced when Africans migrate to Europe. After colonialism, places such as Ghana and Nigeria are left with European institutions and frameworks and they continue to operate within them post-independence. Aidoo positions \\"Our Sister\\" as a radical to stand in strong opposition to those black people whose minds do not seem to be filled with thoughts of their own, such as Sammy, the first black person we are introduced to other than Our Sister. While in Germany Sissie befriends Marija. Although speaking different languages, they build a strong understanding. As Sissie's time in Germany nears an end, Marija makes a pass at her. Sissie has mixed emotions, never having been attracted to a woman before, and it makes her think deeply on same-gendered relationships. Later in the novel, Sissie goes to England and is surprised at the number of Africans she sees. She is shocked at their \\"wretched living conditions\\"; they live in basement flats and wear ugly, worn- in clothing. Sissie is shocked at the women who, had they been in Africa, would have worn the most beautiful, luxurious clothing, and have now ruined their own beauty. Sissie describes their position in England as \\"running very fast just to remain where they are\\".Aidoo, Ama Ata. Our Sister Killjoy: Or, Reflections from a Black-Eyed Squint. London: Longman, 1988, p. 89. Structure The book is split into three different sections and, in its form, the novel switches between two voices: verse and prose. Some portions of the book are structured as poetic verse. These sections sometimes suddenly interrupt the prose sections; in one way, this draws out the plot more slowly, but it also allows the reader to gain a sense of Sissie's inner thoughts and the main themes of the book. The verses tend to have an angry tone, are more retrospective, and generally serve to fill in the gaps and comment on the themes of colonialism and diaspora. The parts to the book that are in prose are used in a more standard way to give basic information about the characters and the plot. Switching unexpectedly between the two voices also creates a sense of tension that reflects the tension Sissie feels during her time in Europe.

Distribution Curculio occidentis is native to the western side of North America. Its range includes British Columbia in Canada, California, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah in the United States, and Mexico. Ecology The female Curculio occidentis lays small batches of typically two to four eggs in a developing acorn. The resulting larvae feed on the kernel and when fully developed, tunnel out of the nut, fall to the ground and dig themselves a small chamber. They may wait one or two years before pupating. Together with larva of the filbertworm moth (Cydia latiferreana), the filbert weevil feeds on the acorns of several species of oak tree. In British Columbia, up to 66% of acorns from garry oak (Quercus garryana) were infected with these larvae. These acorns are still able to germinate, but the germination rate is lower than for uninfected nuts.

Early life Born about 1772, he was son and heir of John Sawrey Morritt, who died at Rokeby Park in Yorkshire on 3 August 1791, by his wife Anne (died 1809), daughter of Henry Peirse of Bedale., M.P. for Northallerton. Both parents were buried in a vault in Rokeby Church, where their son erected to their memory a monument with a poetic inscription. Morritt, who had been in Paris during 1789, and was educated at St John's College, Cambridge where he was admitted later that year. He graduated B.A. 1794 and M.A. 1798. He inherited a large fortune, including the estate of Rokeby, which his father had purchased from Sir Thomas Robinson, 1st Baronet in 1769. On tour Early in 1794, Morritt set off east, and spent two years in travelling, mainly in Greece and Asia Minor. One consequence of his journeying was the wide adoption in English of the term Balkan Mountains by English speakers, in place of the classical name Haemus Mons. The use of Balkan peninsula for south-east Europe came a little later, with August Zeune (1808). Morritt travelled from Vienna to Istanbul, where the embarrassed Robert Liston found the British embassy was in no state to lodge him. On a quest for Troy, he arrived, with James Dallaway and other Englishmen, from Lesbos on 6 November 1794, landing about twenty miles below Cape Lectum, in the Sinus Adramyttenus. There he made a survey of the supposed scene of the Iliad. In politics A conservative in politics, Morritt was returned to parliament by the borough of Beverley at a by-election in 1799. There he had the support of Lord Yarborough and Sir Christopher Sykes.historyofparliamentonline.org, Morritt, John Bacon Sawrey (1771‚Äì1843), of Rokeby, Yorks. He was defeated at the dissolution in 1802. In 1806, Morritt served as high sheriff of Yorkshire, and in 1807 he made a speech at the nomination of William Wilberforce for Yorkshire. In 1814 he was elected on a by vacancy for the constituency of Northallerton, which he represented until 1818, and he sat for Shaftesbury in Dorset from 1818 to 1820. Associations Morritt paid Sir Walter Scott a visit in the summer of 1808, and was again his guest in 1816 and January 1829. Their friendship was never broken. Scott, on his return from London in 1809, spent a fortnight at Rokeby, which he admired. In December 1811 he told Morritt his intention of making it the scene of a poem, and received in reply a letter on its history. Scott's second stay in autumn 1812 resulted in Rokeby, praised for its local descriptions. It was dedicated to Morritt, who was entrusted with the secret of the authorship of the Waverley novels. Scott's visits were renewed in 1815, 1826, 1828, and in September 1831 on his last journey to London and Italy. Letters which passed between them are included in John Gibson Lockhart's Life of Scott; others are in Familiar Letters of Sir Walter Scott (1894). Morritt, on Scott's invitation, became an occasional contributor to the Quarterly Review, and his poem \\"The Curse of Moy, a Highland Tale\\" appeared in the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border (5th edit. iii. 451). Rokeby Venus, c. 1647‚Äì51. 122cm x 177 cm (48in x 49.7in). National Gallery, London. It was on the advice of his friend Thomas Lawrence that Morritt bought the Rokeby Venus, for ¬£500 from the dealer William James Buchanan. He was also acquainted with Stewart Rose, Richard Payne Knight, Sir Humphry Davy, and Robert Southey who visited Rokeby in 1812 and 1829. He was elected a member of the Dilettanti Society on 2 June 1799, and his portrait as \\"arch-master\\" of its ceremonies, in the long crimson taffety-tasselled robe of office, was painted by Sir Martin Archer Shee for the society in 1831‚Äì2. Morritt was one of the founders and a member of the first committee of the Travellers' Club, in 1819. Sir William Fraser mentioned him as a brilliant raconteur. Death Morritt died at Rokeby Park, 12 July 1843, aged 71. He had married, by special license, at the house of Colonel Thomas Stanley, M.P., in Pall Mall, on 19 November 1803, Katharine (d. 1815), second daughter of the Rev. Thomas Stanley, rector of Winwick in Lancashire. He was buried by his wife's side in a vault under Rokeby Church, where a marble tablet, surmounted by a bust of him, was placed in their memory. Works When Jacob Bryant argued that no such city as Troy had existed, Morritt's local knowledge of Turkey led him publish A Vindication of Homer and of the Ancient Poets and Historians who have recorded the Siege and Fall of Troy (1798). This produced from Bryant Some Observations in 1799, and when William Vincent reviewed Morritt's work in the British Critic early in 1799, and issued the criticisms in a separate form, Bryant rushed into print with Expostulation addressed to the \\"British Critic\\" (1799). Morritt retaliated with Additional Remarks on the Topography of Troy, in answer to Mr. Bryant's last Publications (1800). An account of his expedition to Troy was given by Dallaway in Constantinople, with Excursions to the Shores and Islands of the Archipelago, and to the Troad (1797), and his opinions were supported in Remarks and Observations on the Plain of Troy, made during an Excursion in June 1799, by William Francklin. In 1810 Morritt published a pamphlet on the state of parties, Advice to the Whigs, by an Englishman. In 1826 he gave Sir Walter Scott a copy of a printed Letter to Richard Bethell, in favour of Catholic emancipation; Scott noted in his diary that twenty years previously Morritt had entertained other views. Replies to this letter were published by the Rev. William Metcalfe of Kirk Hammerton, and Henry Hall. An essay by Morritt on the History and Principles of Antient Sculpture formed the introduction to the second volume of Specimens of Antient Sculpture preserved in Great Britain issued by the Dilettanti Society in 1835. A volume of Miscellaneous Translations and Imitations of the Minor Greek Poets was published by him in 1802. He composed the inscription on the monument in York Minster to William Burgh. His widow left him a miniature of John Thurloe (but then thought to be of John Milton), painted by Samuel Cooper.

Life  Visitor information at Burke's grave at Smythesdale cemetery Thomas Burke was born in 1826 in Normandy to a military family based in County Galway, Ireland. His parents were Captain John Burke of Her Majesty's 16th Lancers, Tiaquin, County Galway, and Jane Lowe. Burke emigrated to Australia in 1858 from Ireland, where he had been working for the Provincial Bank of Ireland at Limerick. He arrived during the Victorian gold rush, moving first to Melbourne where he worked for the Bank of Australasia, before becoming manager of the Smythesdale branch of the bank around 1860. Smythesdale in the 1860s was a prosperous gold-mining town on the Woady Yaloak River in an area which supported a large though itinerant population of miners and other workers. Burke married Louisa Blake, the daughter of Sir Thomas Edward Blake of Menlough Castle, Galway, at St John‚Äôs Church in Melbourne in 1862. The couple had two young children at the time of Burke's death in 1867. Burke was according to accounts of the day a popular and respected member of the community. He was a Justice of the Peace and in 1861 was elected president of the Smythesdale Mechanics' Institute and also elected to Smythesdale Council.  Murder  One of Burke's tasks as bank manager was to travel throughout the Woady Yaloak diggings buying gold from miners. By this stage gold transports were no longer accompanied by armed escorts. Early on 10 May 1867, Burke collected a horse and buggy from the Smythesdale coach-builder and traveled to the Break O‚Äô Day area (now Corindhap, Victoria), arriving at the nearby town of Rokewood at 1130 am. He bought gold at Rokewood and Break O‚Äô Day, then left to make the return journey to Smythesdale, stopping at hotels along the way to buy more gold. George Searle, a publican at Break O‚Äô Day, and Joseph Ballan, his employee, left on horseback shortly afterward with the intention of robbing Burke. They travelled cross-country and intercepted Burke at what is now the intersection of the Pitfield-Scarsdale Road and the Old Pitfield Road. While Searle distracted Burke with conversation, Ballan walked behind him and shot him in the back of the head. Burke died instantly. Searle and Ballan secured the gold and cash that Burke was carrying, moved the buggy containing Burke's body into scrub beside the road, and released his horse. Louisa Burke raised the alarm when her husband failed to arrive home. Burke's body was discovered the next day.  Investigation and trial  The Woady-Yaloak area was relatively densely populated in 1867, and several witnesses saw Searle and Ballan moving cross-country around the time of Burke's murder. The murder weapon and stolen gold were soon discovered stashed near Searle's hotel at Break O' Day. The pair were arrested and charged with murder. During their trial, Searle admitted to the robbery but sought to have his charge of murder reduced because it was Ballan who had shot Burke. Searle and Ballan were tried at Ballarat by Judge Redmond Barry, who convicted them both of murder and sentenced them to death. Searle and Ballan were hanged at the Ballarat Gaol on 7 August 1867 and buried in the grounds. They were two of thirteen men executed at this prison before the abolition of capital punishment in Australia. The murder achieved notoriety and the trial and execution were widely reported in newspapers around Australia. The courthouse was crowded during the trial and demand to attend the hanging was high.  Aftermath of Burke's murder  Memorial to Thomas Ulick Burke near Smythesdale Burke was buried in the Scarsdale General Cemetery. The plot is easily accessible today and is accompanied by a tourist information sign (see photo at top of page). The murder caused distress among local business people, some of whom who felt it was no longer safe to travel unescorted. An employee of the Union Bank in Smythesdale asked the Police Superintendent at Ballarat for a police escort to be provided when he was carrying money, but the request was refused due to lack of resources. Burke's existing children, Elly Elizabeth and John Lambert, survived to adulthood. Louisa was pregnant at the time of Burke's murder and a third child was born and named Ulick Thomas in December 1867. Louisa remarried in 1872, to John King, with whom she had more children. Elly married William Saunders in Fitzroy, Melbourne in June 1889. John married Minnie Aikenhead at West Devonport, Tasmania, in February 1891. Ulick moved to Tasmania and then to Queensland, where he ran a dairy farm and served in the Australian infantry in World War I. In 1972 a monument was erected near the site of Burke‚Äôs murder by Smythesdale residents (see photo above). In 2001 an alternative monument was erected beside it by a descendant who disagreed with the description of the murderers as \\"bushrangers\\". Both monuments are accessible beside the Pitfield-Scarsdale Road between Scarsdale and Rokewood, about 100 meters south of Old Pitfield Road intersection, at . In 2002 geologist and historian Laurie Moore published a book on the Burke murder. \\"Shot for Gold: The murder of Thomas Ulick Burke at the Woady Yaloak goldfield\\" is available from the Woady Yaloak Historical Society which is headquartered in Smythesdale.

He is currently MD of Relentless Records, which was re-launched as a stand alone division of Sony Music in January 2012. Early Life And Career Beginnings Born at Mbale in Uganda on 19 September 1967, his father a Hindu factory manager and mother an Ismaili Muslim, Jobanputra was forced to leave Uganda in 1972 when Idi Amin expelled the country‚Äôs Asian population. On arrival in the UK, he lived for a year in a refugee camp at West Malling in Kent, before his family were resettled in a council flat in St John‚Äôs Wood, North London. After captaining London‚Äôs schools cricket team and opening the bowling for Middlesex Colts, he began to establish a presence on the capital‚Äôs dance music scene while still studying for a degree in history and politics at the University of East Anglia. DJing at house parties and for pirate stations including LWR led him to his first job in the music industry - as a junior partner with Simon Goffe‚Äôs Heavyweight Management from 1992-4, where he worked with UK chart hip-hop producers Double Trouble and Rebel MC and the Stoke Newington drum and bass band Shut Up And Dance among others. Outcaste Records After starting his own PR company Media Village, which helped Sony records launch the UK careers of The Fugees and Jamiroquai by adapting the US promotional innovation of ‚ÄòStreet Teams‚Äô to the domestic market, Jobanputra co-founded (with college friend Paul Franklyn) the Outcaste label in 1995. Established as a joint venture with the New York hip-hop label Tommy Boy, Outcaste's ‚ÄòAsian Beats‚Äô manifesto both reflected and amplified the increased visibility and confidence of British Asian culture in the mid and late 1990s. The label's first signing Nitin Sawhney went on to be nominated for the Mercury Prize and win a South Bank Show Award for his 1999 album Beyond Skin. Relentless Records Originally set up (in 1999) as a joint venture with Ministry of Sound, Relentless was at first conceived as a vehicle for one-off dance singles The label's debut release - Artful Dodger featuring Craig David‚Äôs \\"Re-Rewind\\" - sold 700,000 copies and marked the point at which the UK Garage genre moved from the underground into the pop mainstream. Subsequent hits included as Daniel Bedingfield‚Äôs \\"Gotta Get Thru This\\" and So Solid Crew‚Äôs \\"21 Seconds\\". In the course of its subsequent evolution, first as part of EMI (from 2003 to 2009) and now Sony, Relentless broadened its musical base to launch the careers of Joss Stone and KT Tunstall among others. And in the 2009-11 period, when the label was sold to Virgin and Shabs Jobanputra became president of Virgin UK, artists he signed to the label included Emeli Sande, Professor Green, Swedish House Mafia and Deadmau5. During this three year timespan, Jobanputra also co-wrote an international top 10 hit - Jay Sean‚Äôs \\"Eyes on You\\" - with Norwegian production team Stargate, and launched a legal challenge to Coke over rights to the Relentless brand name.

Monger, announced that the state government would not introduce legislation to continue state pooling but that the new pool scheme would commence operating independently. The pool had sources adequate finance from the Commonwealth Bank to pay advances and had negotiated with pools in the eastern states to reduce competition. Participants in the scheme were sent a circular by the pool trustees: A. J. Monger (chairman), B. L. Murray, C. W. Harper and J. S. Teasdale. The circular outlined details of chartering ships, delaying construction of bulk handling facilities in Fremantle, construction of holding sheds in other areas, negotiations with the Mill Owners Association and quashing rumours that contracts were not binding. For the 1923 harvest, the pool collected 9.75 million bushels of wheat. Over the course of the 1924‚Äì1925 harvest, the pool received over 14 million bushels with a return to growers of a little over 6s per bushel, not including rail freight. Mr H. E. Braine was appointed as the secretary of the pool prior to 1925 and found himself defending the pool against complaints from farmers who claimed they had been given advice to store their grain and contributing to the pool later hoping the price would rise. The quantity of wheat collected the next season was only just over 6 million bushels; the 1926‚Äì1927 season resulted in 17.93 million bushels being collected by the pool. Following crop failures in India through 1928, the pool supplied over 14.25 million bushels to cover the short fall at prices as described by H. E. Braine as being \\"very satisfactory\\". A record cargo of wheat for the port of Geraldton in 1930 was loaded by the Pool aboard the SS Avala; the vessel was loaded with 80,426 bags, a mass of about . In 1932, the state government was approached by the Pool to confer upon the trustees sole acquiring rights of the land needed to set up bulk handling facilities. Initially the scheme was strongly opposed, and the bill introduced into the parliament was defeated as it was seen to grant a monopoly. In 1933, the bill was reintroduced after a two-season trial in the Wyalkatchem area. The Premier of Western Australia, Philip Collier, revealed that leases of land at 48 country railway sidings had been awarded to Cooperative Bulk Handling. The general manager of the Pool at this time was Mr. J. Thomson. By 1935 the pool had estimated a harvest of over 27 million bushels after good rains had been recorded in July; the estimates were later downgraded to 20 million after a dry spell prior to harvesting. The marketable harvest from the 1942‚Äì43 harvest collected by the pool was 18 million bushels. An early estimate of the following year's production was about 19 million bushels, of which 16.5 million was likely to be marketable.

The church registers date from 1838 for baptisms, 1839 for burials and 1851 for marriages. The church was originally built by R. Potter. In 1953 a south aisle designed by George Pace was added and the east end and chancel were extended. A new vestry and choir vestry were also added. In 1981 a north aisle, north gallery, rear stairs and turrets were added, designed by Ronald Sims. It became Grade II listed on 28 June 1973. The land for the first vicarage in Stumperlowe Lane was again donated by Phoebe Silcock with the cost of construction being covered by public subscription in 1839. Silcock's generosity was remembered in the church's original east window which represented acts of charity. The window was removed during the 1953 enlargement and there is now a copper tablet near the pulpit commemorating Silcock as the foundress of the church.\\"More Of Mayfield Valley With Old Fulwood\\", Muriel Hall, J.W.

Life Eckermann was the fourth child of the justice-councillor Rudolf Eckermann (1824-1904) and his wife Marie (1840-1873). He was born in Ratzeburg, but in 1864 his parents moved to Flensburg then in 1867 to the naval town of Kiel. From 1869 to 1881 he attended the Kieler Gelehrtenschule, moving to the Abitur in 1881 and finally enrolling as a naval cadet on 12 April 1881. His first postings were to , and as well as to the Marineschule in Kiel. After being made a Seekadett (midshipman), he was posted to , remaining with it for two years on its posting to the Far East. After returning home from that trip, he was promoted to Unterleutnant zur See in November 1884 and posted to the officer-training course at the Marineschule. A series of short postings to training ships followed, taking him to the West Indies and the Mediterranean as well as the North Atlantic. He then travelled to North and South America and the West Indies for 18 months on board . He was then sent on a longer posting to the Marinedetachement and the Artilleriepr√ºfungskommission in Berlin. During this time he was temporarily in command of the torpedo boat V 6, travelling between Berlin and Potsdam on the rivers Elbe, Havel and Spree and remaining on standby to transport the Kaiser. In this position he fired a torpedo on the Havelsee in front of the imperial family and received his first decoration, the fourth class of the Order of the Crown, presented personally by the Crown Prince. His Berlin posting was followed by a series of shorter postings to training ships in the Matrosendivision and in the Torpedoabteilung in Wilhelmshaven, as First Officer on the , the fishery protection on the North Sea and as commander of torpedo boats at various training and active divisions. In April 1894 Eckermann was promoted to Kapit√§nleutnant and travelled to South America on the steamer M√ºnchen to join as its navigation officer. This posting lasted eighteen months in South America and the Far East, during which he later moved to . After returning home, Eckermann was made Kompanief√ºhrer in the III. Marine-Artillerie-Abteilung in Lehe bei Bremerhaven. In 1897 he married Marie Luise Stadtlander, daughter of the Prussian vice-consul, ship-owner and ship-broker Johann Stadtlander and his wife Rebecca - Eckermann and his wife had two children. In the years which followed he was ordered to join the Reichsmarineamt in Berlin and served as First Officer of the . From March 1902 to June 1903 he commanded - his first trip with this ship was up the Rhine to D√ºsseldorf for the World Exhibition there. He and the ship then sailed to the West Indies and South America, where the ship sank the Haitian gunboat Cr√™te-√†-Pierrot (which had hijacked the German steamer Markomannia). Joined the naval blockade of Venezuela and carried out a lengthy bombardment of the Venezuelan Fort San Carlos in 1903. The battle started when the fort's gunners opened fire on Panther when she was crossing the sandy bar of Maracaibo lagoon. The captain Eckermann replied the fire but the shallow waters prevented Panther from making an effective bombardment. Inside the fort, two of the gunners managed to score several hits at Panther with their 80-millimeter Krupp gun, causing considerable damage to the ship. After half an hour of exchanging fire, the Panther retreated. The president Cipriano Castro claimed this as a victory, and in response the German commander sent the with heavier weapons to destroy the fort. From 1903 to 1906 he was back at the Reichsmarineamt in Berlin. He next commanded , (1907‚Äì08) and (1908‚Äì10). In autumn 1910 he became Oberwerftdirektor of Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven, holding that position until March 1914. From March to August 1914 he was inspector of the torpedo force at Kiel. Shortly after the start of World War One, from 12 to 31 August 1914, he was commander of the 6th Squadron. On 13 October 1914 he was promoted to vice admiral. A special friend of von Tirpitz, Eckermann was an unconditional supporter of offensive warfare and unrestricted submarine warfare and disliked the restraint imposed on the German Navy early in the war. He tirelessly worked to change this - its first offensive operations, the bombardment of the English coast, were on his initiative. From 12 September 1914 to 3 February 1915 he was chief of staff to the German High Seas Fleet and from 16 February to 19 June 1915 commander of the I Battle Squadron. He then fell seriously ill and retired on 10 July 1915. He died on 13 January 1916 in Kiel, one day after receiving the Iron Cross first class.

Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans (PAAIA)/Zogby, December 2008. Retrieved April 11, 2014. Citizens of the Islamic Republic of Iran are officially divided into four categories: Muslims, Zoroastrians, Jews and Christians. This official division ignores other religious minorities in Iran, notably the agnostics, atheists and Bah√°'√≠s. Within Iran There is a historical context to opposing organised religion and not having faith in Islam throughout the centuries in Iran. In the 10th century AD, the famous Persian scientist Rhazes famously opposed religion and the divine revelation of prophets in his treatises Fƒ´ al-NubuwwƒÅt (On Prophecies) and Fƒ´ ·∏§iyal al- Mutanabbƒ´n (On the Tricks of False Prophets). Further skepticism of the ideas of God could be seen in the quatrains of Khayyam where the compassion of God and the ideas of afterlife are continuously questioned. This work was also written in the 10th century. Under the Pahlavi dynasty from 1925 until the Iranian revolution of 1979, even though atheism was not officially accepted, it was tolerated. With the advent of communism in Russia (the northern neighbour of Iran) and the huge popularity of communist parties in Iran, such as the Tudeh Party especially in the late 1940s and 1960s, atheism grew in popularity. For example, Karo Derderian, the Armenian-Iranian poet and brother to the famous singer Viguen, famously wrote poetry rejecting both God and religion. Although atheism was tolerated by the successive governments, socially the vast majority of people in Iran have been religious. When the revolution in Iran succeeded, given that the Islamic faction of revolutionaries succeeded in gaining total control over the political landscape of the country, irreligion became a political issue. Mehdi Bazargan noted \\"to view Islam as an opposition to Iranian nationalism is tantamount to destroying ourselves. To deny Iranian identity and consider nationalism irreligious is part and parcel of the anti-Iranian movement and is the work of the anti-revolutionaries\\". According to the Ali Reza Eshraghi, religious pressure and inadequate governing from the Iranian government have made Iranian people less religious. Some Iranian feminists have also been noted as being irreligious and atheistic. Irreligious Iranian youth aim to moderate Iranian government policy, and the Iranian youth are among the most politically active among the 57 nations of the Islamic world. As the most restive segment of Iranian society, the young also represent one of the greatest long-term threats to the current form of theocratic rule. After the 2009 presidential election, youth was the biggest bloc involved in the region's first sustained ‚Äúpeople power‚Äù movement for democratic change, creating a new political dynamic in the Middle East. Iran is one of the most tech-savvy societies in the developing world, with an estimated 28 million Internet users, led by youth. Most young Iranians are believed to want to be part of the international community and globalization. Persecution Iran was reported by The Washington Post to be among the thirteen countries where atheism can attract capital punishment. The last noted legal execution for apostasy in Iran was in 2014, when Mohsen Amir-Aslani was convicted and executed for making \\"innovations in religion\\" and insulting the Prophet Jonah. Furthermore, many people, such as Youcef Nadarkhani, Saeed Abedini have been recently harassed, jailed and sentenced to death for apostasy.

Putnam, the average Iranian-American is slightly less religious than the average American. Iranian-Americans are distancing themselves from Islam, having accepted the negative characteristics associated with the religion. This is due to Islam being imposed on the Iranians through conquest, equating to authoritarianism, brutality and corruption. In the book, Social Movements in 20th Century Iran: Culture, Ideology, and Mobilizing Frameworks, author Stephen C. Poulson adds that Western ideas are making Iranians irreligious. Nearly as many Iranian Americans identify as irreligious as Muslim, and a full one-fifth are Christians, Jews, Bah√° º√≠s, or Zoroastrians. Additionally, the number of Muslim Iranian-Americans decreased from 42% in 2008 to 31% in 2012.

Leipzig was a German flush-deck steam corvette, the lead ship of the , named after the 1813 Battle of Leipzig. She was built for the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) in the 1870s, being laid down in early 1875, launched in September that year, and commissioned into the fleet in May 1877. She had one sister ship, . Intended for long cruises abroad, the ship was fitted with a full ship rig to supplement her steam engine if coal was unavailable. She carried a battery of twelve guns. Leipzig went on two overseas cruises as a training ship for naval cadets early in her career. The first, in 1877‚Äì1878, went to Central America and East Asia; while in Central American waters, she was involved in an international dispute between Germany and Nicaragua. The second cruise, which took place from 1882 to 1884, also went to East Asia. While on the way back to Germany, she stopped in the newly-proclaimed colony of German Southwest Africa, where she participated in the flag-raising ceremony. From 1885 to 1888, Leipzig was extensively modernized and reconstructed for use as a squadron flagship overseas. In 1888, Leipzig embarked on a major overseas deployment, first to German East Africa, which was in the midst of the Abushiri revolt. Leipzig and several other warships formed a cruiser squadron that bombarded rebel troops and sent landing parties ashore to suppress the rebellion, which was defeated by 1890. Leipzig and the rest of the squadron went to East Asia, but in 1891 they were reassigned to Chilean waters to protect German interests during the Civil War of 1891. After the fighting subsided, Leipzig alternated between East Africa and East Asia before being recalled to Germany in 1893 after a refit in Cape Town revealed a significant deterioration in her condition. Found to be not worth repairing, she was converted into a barracks ship and training hulk, a role she filled until 1919, when she sank unexpectedly. She was raised in 1921 and subsequently broken up in 1921. Design After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871, the newly formed Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) began an expansion program to strengthen the fleet. The naval command determined that modern steam corvettes were necessary for scouting purposes, as well as overseas cruising duties to protect German interests abroad. The two Leipzig- class corvettes were ordered as part of the fleet plan of 1873, which called for a total of twenty unarmored corvettes, twelve of which were already either in service or under construction. Leipzig was the first iron-hulled corvette of the German fleet; originally designed with a forecastle, the ship was completed with a flush deck instead. Leipzig was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 39 officers and 386 enlisted men. She was powered by a single marine steam engine that drove one 2-bladed screw propeller, with steam provided by ten coal-fired fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of at . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . Leipzig was equipped with a full ship rig to supplement her steam engines on long-distance cruises. Leipzig was armed with a battery of twelve breech-loading guns, two of which were 25-caliber (cal.); the other ten were shorter 20-cal. weapons. Two of the guns were in the bow as chase guns, with the rest on the broadside. Later in her career, she had four Hotchkiss revolver cannon installed, along with four torpedo tubes. These were all above-water launchers, with two in the bow and one on each side. Service history Leipzig was laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in 1875. Her completed hull was launched on 13 September 1875, and her launching ceremony was attended by the Chief of the Kaiserliche Admiralit√§t (Imperial Admiralty), General Albrecht von Stosch, who christened the ship Leipzig after the 1813 Battle of Leipzig. After fitting-out work was completed, she was towed from Stettin to Swinem√ºnde on 31 May 1877 and was commissioned into the fleet the following day, though she had not yet had her armament installed. The Oberburgermeister of Leipzig, Otto Robert Georgi, and Field Marshal Prince Friedrich Karl of Prussia attended the commissioning ceremony; Georgi gave the ship its flags as a gift from the city of Leipzig. Leipzig then began initial sea trials that lasted until 12 June. The ship then had her guns installed, after which she began further trials starting on 13 September under the command of Korvettenkapit√§n (KK‚ÄîCorvette Captain) Carl Paschen. A week later, she accidentally ran aground off Kleverberg outside Kiel and had to have some of ballast removed before she could be refloated. She was then towed to the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel by the shipyard tugboat Notus. Sea trials were completed on 5 October, and the following day, Leipzig was ordered to begin her first overseas cruise. First overseas cruise Leipzig with the frigate and the corvette off Nicaragua in March 1878 Still under Paschen's command, Leipzig was to be employed as a training ship for naval cadets. She embarked men from the Crew of 1876, which included the future admirals Erich G√ºhler, Wilhelm Schack, and Adolph von Bassewitz. Paschen's orders instructed him to proceed to East Asia, where he would serve as the commander of German warships in the region. On 17 November, Leipzig departed Germany and crossed the Atlantic Ocean, stopping first in Central American waters. While there, she was temporarily assigned to a German squadron tasked with protecting German interests in Nicaragua during the so-called \\"Eisenstuck Affair\\". A pair of German merchants, Paul and Christian Eisenstuck, were reportedly attacked in the country and the Nicaraguan government did not investigate the incident quickly enough for German satisfaction, and so Bernhard Ernst von B√ºlow, the foreign minister, ordered a flotilla of warships to enforce German demands for an indemnity. In early 1878, Leipzig and five other vessels that had gathered off the coast landed men at Corinto to seize weapons in the event that Nicaragua chose to resist German demands, though the government quickly acceded. On 11 April, Leipzig resumed her voyage to East Asia. After rounding the southern tip of South America and entering the Pacific Ocean, she stopped in Honolulu in the Hawaiian Islands, where she was visited by King KalƒÅkaua. She then visited several ports in Mexico and the United States, before proceeding across the Pacific. She arrived in Yokohama, Japan on 5 July, where she relieved the corvette , which then departed for Germany. At the time, the East Asia Squadron also included the gunboats and , though Albatross was soon replaced by , and the corvette joined them later. On 7 October, Paschen was promoted to the rank of Kapit√§n zur See (KzS‚ÄîCaptain at Sea); at that time, all four ships of the squadron rendezvoused in Nagasaki, Japan. Over the following five months, Leipzig remained in Japanese waters. In April 1879, she sailed to China, where she met her sister ship and the corvette , which had been sent to replace Leipzig and Freya, respectively. On 28 May, Leipzig departed Shanghai and began the voyage back to Germany, stopping in Singapore, Anjer in the Dutch East Indies, Mauritius, Cape Town, South Africa, and Plymouth, Great Britain, before arriving in Kiel on 27 September. There, she was decommissioned. Second overseas cruise Leipzig remained out of service until late 1882, and during this period she underwent an extensive overhaul that included moving the bridge further aft, replacing the rudder with a more effective one, and installing the four 35 cm torpedo tubes. On returning to service in October 1882 under the command of KK Otto Herbig, she embarked the 1881 Crew, which included Franz von Hipper. The ship departed Germany on 19 October and after encountering severe storms in the North Sea, stopped in Plymouth and Yarmouth to wait for the weather to improve. She thereafter followed the same route to East Asia as she had in 1877, though she did not stop in Central America while en route. She reached East Asia in June 1883, where she joined the corvette , the flagship of Konteradmiral (KAdm‚ÄîRear Admiral) Louis von Blanc. In August, Leipzig visited Vladivostok, Russia, and in October, she carried the German Consul General from Shanghai to Chemulpo, so he could sign a trade agreement between Germany and the Kingdom of Korea. Poor weather conditions compelled Leipzig to stay in Korea through December, and during this period Herbig, four officers, and the ship's band went to visit King Gojong of Korea in Seoul. On 15 December, Herbig was promoted to the rank of Kapit√§n zur See. In early March 1884, Leipzig received orders to begin the voyage back to Germany. The ship stopped first in Manila in the Philippines before sailing through the Sulu Sea to northern Borneo, where she stopped in Sandakan. From there, she sailed to Singapore for repairs that lasted from 19 April to 10 June. During this stay, a major outbreak of fever rendered 6 officers and 230 sailors seriously ill, and they had to be transported home, with a replacement crew sent to bring Leipzig back to Germany. While in Cape Town, Herbig received new orders directing him to take Leipzig to German South West Africa, which had recently been declared a German protectorate. Leipzig sailed to L√ºderitz Bay on 18 July, where she was joined by the screw frigate on 6 August. Elisabeths captain read the formal proclamation announcing the German protectorate, and Leipzig remained in the area to patrol the new colony. On 30 August, she went to the island of Fernando Po, where she met the gunboat , which had the German Commissioner Gustav Nachtigal aboard. On 5 September, she sailed to Porto Seguro in Togoland. Leipzig then left West African waters and returned to Germany by way of Cape Verde, Madeira, and Plymouth. She reached Wilhelmshaven, Germany, on 9 October. Refit Leipzig in dry dock in 1885 during an extensive refit The Admiralit√§t issued orders on 18 February 1885 to heavily rebuild the ship, which on 25 November 1884 had been re-designated as a \\"Kreuzerfregatte\\" (Cruiser-Frigate). She was to be modified for service as a permanent cruiser squadron flagship, able to remain abroad for extended periods of time. At that time, the German navy did not possess a ship suited to that purpose, and opposition in the Reichstag (Imperial Diet) prevented the construction of a new vessel to fill the role. Leipzig was stripped down to her iron hull and almost completely rebuilt with new wood planking, the installation of additional transverse bulkheads to increase the number of watertight compartments, a new propulsion system, and a reorganization of the interior spaces to accommodate an admiral and his staff. The new boilers installed in the ship necessitated the addition of a second funnel, which was fixed, as opposed to the original funnel that could be retracted. Work was finished by late 1886, and the ship was recommissioned under the command of KK Herbing for sea trials, which lasted from 1 September to 20 October. Speed tests demonstrated that the ship was not fast enough for her intended duties, and attempts to increase her speed by fitting a different rudder to reduce drag failed to rectify the problem. She therefore went back into the shipyard, and during this period, electrical generators were installed to provide electric lights for the entire ship. She was recommissioned again on 12 October 1887, again under Herbing's command, for additional trials that lasted until 12 November. Her speed still proved unsatisfactory, and during the tests she suffered an accident with her propeller. On 6 April 1888, she was again ready for trials, now under command of KK Eduard Hartog. She was still too slow, so she returned to the shipyard yet again, though she remained in commission during this last period, and in early June she was finally declared ready for service. Third overseas cruise =1888‚Äì1890= Map of German East Africa from 1890 Leipzig embarked on her next deployment abroad on 14 June to replace the corvette . The new squadron commander, KAdm Karl August Deinhard, was travelling independently by passenger ship. Leipzig stopped in Aden on 16 July, where she formally relieved Bismarck as the squadron flagship, and proceeded to Zanzibar, where she arrived on 2 August. There, she joined the corvette ; the latter vessel's commander, KzS Franz Strauch was serving as the squadron's interim commander while Deinhard was still en route, and so he transferred to Leipzig and Hartog took his place aboard Olga. Deinhard arrived on 31 August and took command of the squadron in Manda Bay, Kenya. At the time, the squadron consisted of Leipzig, Olga, M√∂we, and from 31 December the unprotected cruiser and from 5 January 1889 the aviso . The squadron, which was intended to operate in the South Pacific, had instead to remain off German East Africa due to the Abushiri revolt, a major rebellion against German rule; this was indeed the reason Schwalbe and Pfeil were sent to reinforce the squadron. The operations conducted off German East Africa were the largest and longest sustained action of the German fleet before World War I. On 8 September, Leipzig, Olga, and M√∂we sent troops ashore at Tanga. Leipzig then went to Bagamoyo where she shelled rebel troops. Starting on 2 November, the German ships enforced a blockade of the coast in concert with the Royal Navy, and a month later the Italian and Portuguese warships in the region joined the effort. From 5 to 6 December, Leipzig again bombarded rebel forces in Bagamoyo; she remained there for the rest of the month and was joined there for subsequent battles by the corvette . Leipzig then went to Dar es Salam, which she helped to defend from 11 to 16 January 1889. On 3 February, she went to Bagamoyo to defend the port from renewed rebel attacks. Leipzigs marines took part in the occupation of Kunduchi on 27 March 1889, in a campaign led by Major Hermann Wissmann. On 8 May, men from Leipzig, Carola, and Schwalbe attacked a rebel camp outside of Bagamoyo, and two days later Leipzigs detachment attacked Mbegani and Mwangoni. Leipzig, Pfeil, and Schwalbe shelled Saadani on 6 June and sent men ashore to attack rebels there. In July, Leipzig operated off Pangani and Tanga and participated in the blockade effort. By the end of July, the insurrection was all but over; Dar es Salam and Bagamoyo had been successfully defended and Wissmann's troops had retaken Tanga and Saadani. In August, Schwalbe was detached to rest her crew in Mauritius and M√∂we was sent home. On 13 August, Leipzig left East Africa to undergo an overhaul in Cape Town. The work lasted into September, and while Leipzig was away, her place as squadron flagship was taken by Carola. On 4 September, while Leipzig was still in the drydock, Deinhard received instructions that he was to take his ship as soon as was possible to the Mediterranean Sea, where he was to brief Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was cruising there in his yacht Hohenzollern with the Armored Training Squadron. By early October, work on Leipzig had proceeded to the point where the ship was again seaworthy and she was able to steam north to the eastern Mediterranean, which she reached on 28 October. She rendezvoused with the Armored Training Squadron off the island of Mytilene on 1 November; Hohenzollern was at that time in Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire, and she arrived five days later. Deinhard delivered his report on 6 November, after which all of the German ships steamed to Italy and Leipzig went into the drydock in Venice on 12 November to complete the overhaul begun in Cape Town. =1890‚Äì1891= The overhaul was finished on 15 December, allowing Leipzig to return to East Africa, stopping in Malta and Port Said on the way; while in the latter port, the ship's crew celebrated Christmas and New Year's Day, 1890. The ship then proceeded to Aden, where she received orders to proceed to East Asia, rather than East Africa. The rest of the squadron was to remain in East African waters, while Leipzig proceeded independently to China. While on the way across the Indian Ocean, she stopped in Kochi, India, before reaching Hong Kong on 20 March. There, she joined the other warships on the East Asia station, the corvette and the gunboats and Wolf. By this time, Deinhard had been promoted to the rank of Vizeadmiral (VAdm‚ÄîVice Admiral) and recalled to Germany; his replacement, KAdm Victor Valois, began the voyage out to take command of the squadron. Leipzig began a tour of Japanese ports, and while in Nagasaki on 20 May, Valois reached the ship. Leipzig then cruised south to Singapore via Hong Kong and Manila, after which she toured the Dutch East Indies, sailed through Dampier Strait, and then visited the Bismarck Archipelago. The voyage ended in Sydney, Australia on 16 September, where she met the corvette , which then joined the squadron. Leipzig went into drydock in Sydney for repairs, and in November the squadron sailed to New Zealand and then to Apia in Samoa. In January 1891, the ships of the East Asia Squadron left Apia and returned to Hong Kong, at times sailing independently. Leipzig arrived there on 14 February and beginning in mid- March, she began a tour of Chinese ports, which included Nanking. While in the Wusung Roads she ran aground, but was able to free herself at high tide. Valois received instructions ordering him to take his corvettes to Chile, but the grounding delayed his departure. He had taken Leipzig to Yokohama to have the ship's hull inspected for damage, and while there he received another set of orders stressing the need to proceed to South America as soon as possible. Chile was embroiled in the Civil War of 1891, and the conflict threatened German interests in the country. The German chancellor, Leo von Caprivi, initially opposed sending warships to join the international fleet that had begun to assemble off Chile to protect foreigners in the country, but after an extended debate in the Reichstag, he relented and ordered Valois to Chile. The second order he had received was worded so harshly that he instructed his ship's captains to skip replenishing their coal stocks to avoid any further delay, hoping instead to use favorable winds to cross the Pacific as quickly as possible. As the ships crossed the Pacific, they did not find the winds to be strong enough to propel them as quickly as Valois had hoped, and so they had to resort to their steam engines. But Leipzig, which notoriously burned through coal at a prodigious rate, ran out of fuel while en route. Sophie and Alexandrine had to take her under tow for the rest of the voyage, which covered some over the course of 97 hours. The ships initially went to San Francisco, United States before proceeding south to Valparaiso; they arrived on 6 July, but remained outside of the harbor for three days. At the time, fighting had not yet spread to the city, and so from late July to late August, he took his ships further north to Iquique and Coquimbo. Valois returned to Valparaiso on 20 August, and by that time, rebel forces had advanced on the city. He negotiated with Captain Jorge Montt, a Chilean Navy officer that supported the rebel Congressist faction, to allow a German landing party of 9 officers and 291 sailors to go ashore to protect Germans in the city. This effort was done in cooperation with a party from the British corvette . While the men were ashore, they set up a hospital under the supervision of Leipzigs doctor. On 30 August, the rebel forces under Colonel Estanislao del Canto had taken control of the city. With the fighting in the city over, the landing party returned to their ships on 13 September. Shortly thereafter, the Chilean president, Jos√© Manuel Balmaceda, killed himself, which effectively ended the conflict. Valois's ships remained in Chile for another three months but there were no further incidents in the country. =1891‚Äì1893= In mid-December, Valois received orders from Berlin to leave the region. The ships passed through the Strait of Magellan on 1 January 1892 and arrived in Montevideo five days later. Valois expected to be instructed to return home at this point, but he was instead ordered to cross the Atlantic to Cape Town. While en route, they stopped in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The ships reached Cape Town on 21 February; two days later, KAdm Friedrich von Pawelsz arrived to relieve Valois as the squadron commander. The ships underwent repairs in Cape Town before sailing north to Delagoa Bay on 22 March, where Pawelsz traveled overland to the South African Republic to pay a visit to the president, Paul Kruger. The ships then continued on to German East Africa, where they joined Schwalbe and M√∂we. The situation there was calm, so the squadron continued on to East Asia, leaving behind Sophie, as she was scheduled to return to Germany in June. Her place was taken by the corvette . Leipzig and Alexandrine continued on to Colombo, where they embarked replacement crews for Iltis and Wolf. The two corvettes then steamed to Hong Kong. They thereafter toured Chinese ports in September and October, during which time Alexandrine left for Japan. While Leipzig was in Shanghai, Pawelsz received orders to return to East Africa, as the succession of Ali bin Said of Zanzibar threatened to destabilize the region. Pawelsz recalled Alexandrine and the two ships rendezvoused in Hong Kong; they departed on 16 November to return to East Africa. The ships reached Zanzibar on 5 January 1893; a month later, on 6 February, Arcona joined them. The corvette , which had been stationed in Central American waters, was also assigned to Pawelsz's squadron. Schwalbe and M√∂we were also still in East Africa, bringing the total number of vessels available to respond to any crises resulting from bin Said's accession to the throne to six. The transition proved to be uneventful, and so on 3 March Leipzig went to Cape Town for an overhaul; she was joined there by Arcona and Alexandrine later in the month. It was planned that the squadron would return to East Asia once repairs were completed, but it was discovered that Leipzig had deteriorated significantly in her years abroad. Wear on her propulsion system proved to be too extensive for the shipyard in Cape Town, and so VAdm Friedrich von Hollmann, the State Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (RMA‚ÄîImperial Navy Office), ordered her to return to Germany. On 29 March, Pawelsz received instructions to return home with Leipzig and to dissolve the squadron; the other ships were to proceed elsewhere independently. Leipzig sailed north through the Atlantic, stopping in Saint Helena, Cape Verde, and Madeira on the way. She was greeted in the Schillig roadstead by Admiral Max von der Goltz and her old commander, VAdm Valois, who was now the Chief of the Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea Naval Station). Fate On arriving in Wilhelmshaven, Leipzig was decommissioned to be examined thoroughly in the Kaiserliche Werft there. The inspection determined that the ship's hull was still in good condition, but it would not be economical to repair her machinery for another overseas deployment. The RMA therefore decided to convert the vessel into both a hulk for engine-room training and a barracks ship. In these capacities, she would replace the old frigate . Allocating the funds for the work proved to be controversial in the Reichstag, and so they were not approved until the 1895‚Äì1896 budget. Leipzig continued to serve for another twenty-five years in this capacity. The first wireless telegraphy school for the German navy was set up aboard the ship, and during World War I she was used for initial training for U-boat crews. On 5 November 1919, the ship suddenly sank in port for unknown reasons. She was later raised in 1921, sold to Hattinger Co., and broken up in Wilhelmshaven.

Formal definition More precisely, a functional encryption scheme for a given functionality f consists of the following four algorithms: *(\\\\text{pk}, \\\\text{msk}) \\\\leftarrow \\\\textsf{Setup}(1^\\\\lambda): creates a public key \\\\text{pk} and a master secret key \\\\text{msk}. *\\\\text{sk} \\\\leftarrow \\\\textsf{Keygen}(\\\\text{msk}, f): uses the master secret key to generate a new secret key \\\\text{sk} for the function f. *c \\\\leftarrow \\\\textsf{Enc}(\\\\text{pk}, x): uses the public key to encrypt a message x. *y \\\\leftarrow \\\\textsf{Dec}(\\\\text{sk}, c): uses secret key to calculate y = f(x) where x is the value that c encrypts. The security of FE requires that any information an adversary learns from an encryption of x is revealed by f(x). Formally, this is defined by simulation. Applications Functional encryption generalizes several existing primitives including Identity-based encryption (IBE) and attribute-based encryption (ABE). In the IBE case, define F(k,x) to be equal to x when k corresponds to an identity that is allowed to decrypt, and \\\\perp otherwise. Similarly, in the ABE case, define F(k, x) = x when k encodes attributes with permission to decrypt and \\\\perp otherwise. History Functional encryption was proposed by Amit Sahai and Brent Waters in 2005 and formalized by Dan Boneh, Amit Sahai and Brent Waters in 2010. Until recently, however, most instantiations of Functional Encryption supported only limited function classes such as boolean formulae. In 2012, several researchers developed Functional Encryption schemes that support arbitrary functions.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History The castle was first mentioned in the historic record as castrum Wissenowe in 1298. It is unclear whether it was built by the Lords of Rotenfluh (Unspunnen) and then given in fief to the Freiherr of Weissenau or if it was built by the Weissenau family as the center of their estates. The castle was built on what was an island at the mouth of the Aare river into Lake Thun. In the intervening centuries, the waterway silted up and the island became connected to shore. The market town of Widen grew up across the channel from the castle and in 1362 was connected to the castle by a bridge. Around 1334, the Freiherr of Weissenau joined other local nobles in a war against the growing power of the city of Bern. After the defeat of the nobles, Weissenau was forced to sell the castle and Widen to Interlaken Abbey to pay his debts. In 1365, the Abbey moved the weekly markets and yearly fair away from Widen and to the village of Aarm√ºhle (which is now Interlaken). Losing the market devastated Widen and it began to decline. In 1528, the city of Bern adopted the new faith of the Protestant Reformation and began imposing it on the Bernese Oberland. The Abbey and its villages joined in an unsuccessful rebellion against the new faith. After Bern imposed its will on the Oberland, they secularized the Abbey and annexed all the Abbey lands. Weissenau Castle and the small village of Widen became a part of the Bernese bailiwick of Interlaken. The castle was used as a prison into the 16th century, but began to fall into disrepair and eventually collapsed. In 1655 and again in 1700 the bailiwick made plans to renovate and repair the castle. However, neither plan was implemented. Castle site Today only ruins remain of the castle. The castle residence and tower, portions of the castle building and the curtain wall are all still standing.

Established in 1863, Nagpur Central Museum is one of the oldest museums in India and Maharashtra.Nagpur City Museum/ Nagpur Central Museum It holds important artifacts such as dinosaurs' fossils, coins, ancient inscriptions, sculptures, arms, tribal artifacts from per-historic to the modern time. The Nagpur Central Museum is the oldest and largest museum in the Central India region.  History  The idea of founding a museum at Nagpur was first recommended by the antiquarian society of the Central Provinces in 1862. Under instruction of Sir Richard Temple, then the Chief commissioner of the Central Province, a committee was constituted for establishment of museum and library at Nagpur. Based on the committee's plan, Nagpur Central Museum was established in 1863. Spearheaded by Sir Richard Temple, the royal families in the central India, native chiefs, landlord and all the district holders took a great interest in collection of the rare objects for the newly formed museum. The collections were enriched by acquiring exhibits from the exhibitions held at Nagpur and Jabalpur in 1865-66. Collection in the museum was sourced from Chhattisgarh, Vidarbha, Madhya Pradesh and even some parts of Western Maharashtra. After its inception the museum was under care of the Director of Public Instruction of the Central Province; but in 1883, it was transferred to the Director of Agriculture. In 1919, the museum was again transferred to the department of Industries. Since the independence in 1947, the museum activities are mostly directed towards reorganizing of the galleries on the modern line. Presently, the museum is under control of the Director of Archaeology and Museum, Government of Maharashtra. Recently, the Central Museum has undergone a major renovation work, which include provisions for gardens and a cafeteria. As a part of digitization drive, 10 interactive information kiosks are now installed in the museum. The Central Museum is the first museum in Maharashtra to install Quick Response (QR) Code in display galleries, which provide information about artifacts in Marathi, Hindi, English and 13 foreign languages. However, due to inadequacy of display facilities and galleries several important artifacts are still locked within the reserve collection. The building The museum is situated in a huge colonial style building designed by Capt. Cobbe in Civil lines area of Nagpur. The museum galleries have over 8,000 square feet of display space. Collections The museum is spread over eleven galleries, each with different themes. Natural history collection This gallery has a rare collection of dinosaurs‚Äô fossils, mineral stones, antlers, reptiles, fish and invertebrates specimen. One of the dinosaur's fossils is almost 67.5 million years old. The fossil belongs to Jainosaurus (a large Titanosaurian dinosaur of India and wider Asia) which was excavated in the Jabalpur district of Madhya Pradesh back in 1932-33. This gallery showcases glimpse of flora and fauna of Central India through its huge collection of stuffed animals and birds.  Nagpur heritage collection  A special gallery dedicated to the history of Nagpur is also designed in the museum. Here, tourists can see antiquities from the chalcolithic sites of Sarasvati‚ÄìIndus and Kaundinyapura excavations, megalithic sarcophagus, stone and copper plate inscriptions, coins of different ages, and metals, etc.  Sculpture collection  This gallery has a collection of stone sculptures of Buddha, Vishnu and other mythological figures from Maurya period to Maratha time.  Arm and armor collection  This gallery has a rich collection of arms used by the Tribal, Mughals, Marathas and British rulers.  Tribal art collection  The tribal art gallery showcases objects used by tribal communities like boomerangs, tobacco boxes, tools, musical instruments etc.  Painting collection  The Nagpur Central Museum also has an art gallery, which houses some unique paintings from the Bombay School of Art. Museum library The museum houses a reference library with rare ancient inscriptions, manuscripts, books and publications.

Q is the anelastic attenuation factor or the seismic quality factor, a measure of the energy loss as the seismic wave moves. To obtain a solution when we make computations with a seismic model we always have to consider the problem of instability and try to obtain a stabilized solution for seismic inverse Q filtering. Basics When a wave propagates through subsurface materials both energy dissipation and velocity dispersion takes place. Inverse Q filtering is a method to restore the energy loss due to energy dissipation (amplitude compensation) and to correct the time-shift of the data due to velocity dispersion. Wang has written an excellent book on the subject of inverse Q filtering, Seismic inverse Q filtering (2008), and discuss the subject of stabilizing the method. He writes: ‚ÄúThe phase-only inverse Q filter mentioned above is unconditionally stable. However, if including the accompanying amplitude compensation in the inverse Q filter, stability is a major issue of concern in implementation.‚ÄùWang 2008 p.64 Hale (1981)Hale, D, 1981 Q-adaptive deconvolution: SEP report 30. p.140 found that the inverse Q filter overcompensated the amplitudes for the later events in a seismic trace. Therefore, in order to obtain reasonable amplitude, the amplitude spectrum of the computed filter has to be clipped at some maximum gain to prevent undue amplitude at later times. On basis of this concept Wang proposed a stabilized inverse Q filtering approach that was able to compensate simultaneously for both attenuation and dispersion.‚ÄùWang 2008 p.66 The unclipped version of Wang‚Äôs solution is presented in the wikipedia article seismic inverse Q filtering. The solution is based on the theory of wavefield downward continuation. In this outline here I will compute on a clipped version by introducing low-pass filtering. Both Hale and Wang introduced low- passfiltering as a method for stabilization. Calculations We have the equation for seismic inverse Q filtering from Wang: :U(t+\\\\bigtriangleup t,w)=U(t,w)\\\\exp \\\\bigg(\\\\frac{w}{w_r}^{-\\\\gamma} \\\\frac{w\\\\bigtriangleup t}{2Q(w)}\\\\bigg) \\\\exp \\\\bigg( i\\\\frac{w}{w_r}^{-\\\\gamma} w\\\\bigtriangleup t\\\\bigg) \\\\quad (1) : \\\\gamma =(\\\\pi Q_r)^{-1} Time is denoted œÑ, frequency is w and i is the imaginary unit. Qr and wr are reference values representing damping and frequency for a certain frequency. To demonstrate stability we can simply bypass using a reference frequency and get a more simple equation: :U(t+\\\\bigtriangleup t,w)=U(t,w)\\\\exp \\\\bigg( \\\\frac{w\\\\bigtriangleup t}{2Q(w)}\\\\bigg) \\\\exp \\\\bigg( i w\\\\bigtriangleup t\\\\bigg) \\\\quad (2) The sum of these plane waves gives the time-domain seismic signal, :U(t+\\\\bigtriangleup t) =\\\\int_0^\\\\infty U(t+\\\\bigtriangleup t,w)dw.\\\\quad (2.b) On figure 1 is presented the solution of (2/2.b) for a seismic model for different Q-values, which clearly indicates the numerical instability. Number on top of figure 1 corresponds with the Q number, 1=Q1, 2=Q2 etc. The results are close to the results presented in Wang‚Äôs book (each trace is scaled individually, so artefacts are stronger on trace 5 than on trace 4). However, Wang also considered phase compensation. Computations here are for amplitude only inversion since the phase compensation is unnecessary to demonstrate instability because it is always stable. File:Qfilter3.pngFigure 1. Inverse Qfiltered traces Q1=400,Q2=200,Q3=100,Q4=50,Q5=25 Low-passfiltering and inverse Q-filtering In practice, the artefacts caused by numerical instability can be suppressed by a low-pass filter. Hale wrote that the unclipped IQF of a seismogram amplified the Nyquist frequency by a factor 7x106 when we had the ratio t/Q=10 and concluded that for typical seismograms with lengths longer than 1000 samples and Q value around 100, data is seldom pure enough to warrant the use of unclipped IQF. Wang introduced a cutoff frequency to set up a criterion for the stabilization by a mathematical formula. However, considering Hales‚Äô article it could be sufficient to simply remove the Nyquist frequency. That means to let the frequency close to Nyquist frequency be the cutoff frequency. On fig.2 we see a seismic model giving us benchmark data for inverse Q-filtering (red graph). We will see that IQF of this model will amplify the Nyquist frequency by a factor little less than 5x106. File:Qfilter4.pngFigure 2. Seismic benchmark data model. Green graph is undamped and red graph is damped impulse response Q=50 Figure 3 is the amplitude-only inverse Q filtered trace of figure 2 for Q=50 (trace 4). The result clearly indicates the numerical instability. Artefacts are seen through the whole trace. File:Trace6.pngFig.3. Model from fig.2. with applied invers Q-filter Q=50. We will try to remove the artefacts by applying a low-pass filter on the trace of figure 3. We used MATLABS signal processing tool and created a low-passfilter (Zero-phase IIR-filter) on fig.4 with cutoff frequency at 120 Hz. The amplitude response of the filter is in blue and the phase in green. File:Low-pass filter 2.png Fig.4. Low-pass filter The result of filtering trace on fig.3 with the low-passfilter of fig.4 is shown on fig.5. All artefacts are removed and we are left with the impulse response that can be compared with the original model on fig.2. File:Qfilter6.pngFigure 5. Filtered impulserespons where all unstable energy are removed. Frequency-response A study of the frequency response of the trace of figure 3 (unclipped) and figure 5 (clipped) will give more insight into the filtering process. Figure 6 shows the magnitude of the frequency response as a function of digital frequency before filtering. This representation gives a good picture of what happens around the Nyquist frequency when filtering with the low-pass filter is done. Unstable energy is accumulated close to the Nyquistfrequency. After filtering the unstable energy around the Nyquist-frequency is completely removed, and fig.7 give the frequency response of the impulse response of fig.5. File:Qfilter7.pngFigure 6. Frequency-response with digital frequency before filtering. File:Qfilter8.pngFigure 7. Frequency-response with digital frequency after filtering.

Diplomatic career From 1990 to 1992, Lekiƒá served as ambassador of the SFR Yugoslavia in Mozambique, Swaziland, and Lesotho. From September 1992 to December 1995, he was the minister of foreign affairs of the Republic of Montenegro. Subsequently, he became Yugoslav ambassador to Italy and Malta for two terms (1995-1999 and 2001-2003). Between 1999 and 2001 he worked for the United Nations's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). During his second term he received a wide media attention for his strong criticism of NATO intervention in Yugoslavia during the Kosovo War, most notably in Porta a Porta talk show. Academic career in Italy In 2003, Lekiƒá fell out with the new Montenegrin president Milo ƒêukanoviƒá and left the Yugoslav diplomatic service. He became a lecturer at the LUISS Guido Carli in Rome. He taught comparative politics from 2003 to 2004, international negotiation technique from 2004 to 2012 and diplomacy from 2012 to 2013. At the same time, he lectured international relations and negotiation technique at the faculty of humanities, Sapienza University of Rome from 2005 to 2007. Return to Montenegrin politics In 2011, he founded the Center for International Policy and European Integration (CEMP) in Podgorica. In 2012, he became the leader of the opposition alliance Democratic Front formed by the Movement for Changes (PzP) and the New Serb Democracy (NOVA). He led the alliance's list in the parliamentary election of October 2012. Lekiƒá ran in the 2013 presidential election, supported by both his Democratic Front and the Socialist People's Party. According to the electoral committee's report, he was narrowly defeated by incumbent Filip Vujanoviƒá. However, many independent observers insisted that Vujanoviƒá's victory came about as the result of an electoral fraud, which resulted in a number of demonstrations of Lekiƒá's supporters. Following internal disagreements within the coalition, Lekiƒá split from DF and formed the new political party - Democratic Alliance (Demos) on 18 May 2015, announcing its two main goals: making Montenegro into a legal and decriminalised country and unifying the opposition parties.

The development of the village is connected to the saline springs. These were used to produce brine and salt for some hundred years.  Geography  S√ºlbeck lies in southern Lower Saxony between the Harz and Solling Mountains. It is located 1 km west of the river Leine, at the western edge of the Leine Graben.Hansj√∂rg K√ºster: Geschichte der Landschaft in Mitteleuropa: von der Eiszeit bis zur Gegenwart. C.H. Beck. 1995, p. 26 (online) The village is immediately west of the nature reserve that is located in the flood retention basin Salzderhelden.  History  Upper Drilling Derrick built 1865 Prehistoric settlements in the vicinity of the salt springs is proven: \\"From the S√ºlbecker mountain originate some tools that have been manufactured from Neanderthals resting there\\".Einbecker Geschichtsverein (ed.): Einbecks D√∂rfer - Bilder aus vergangenen Zeiten, Duderstadt 1995, p. 132 f. During the development of a new housing area \\"Am Bohrturm\\" (At the Derrick) in the 1980s further archaeological investigations were carried out which showed that the settlements date back to about 5000 BC. The first written source is to be found in a deed of the monastery Amelungsborn from the year 1210. The deed talks about the \\"Salinis\\" at Siburgehusen. On 26 April 1686 the Elector Ernst August of Hanover Calenberg ordered, that in S√ºlbeck salt works including a graduation tower were to be built. The history of the salt works is the main difference between S√ºlbeck and its neighbor farming villages.  History of the saltworks  The Duchy of Brunswick-L√ºneburg was seeking possibilities for more income and therefore a proposal was made by the administrative head of the county of Salzderhelden, to which S√ºlbeck belonged, to build salt works in S√ºlbeck. The project was driven by Otto Friedrich von Moltke, the last resident of the castle Heldenburg, now ruined.Georg Schambach, Wilhelm M√ºller: Nieders√§chsische Sagen und M√§rchen, 1855, p 360 Due to the high salinity of the brine with 9,4 %Gernot Schmidt: Das l√∂bliche Saltzwerck zu S√ºlbeck. Deutsches Bergbau-Museum. Bochum 1995, 20. it was planned to boil the brine directly.Solhaus Yet exact calculations showed that the costs for the wood used as fuel would have been prohibitively high. So the project was greatly expanded to include a graduation tower to increase the salinity of the brine to about 20%. This first graduation tower was about 166 m long and stretched south from the current S√ºlbeck village square, Dorfplatz. In 1686 the first main brine well was ready plus two smaller wells. To pump the brine out of the soil and supply the graduation tower pumps were needed. The only apparent source of power at the time was water, which was in short supply on site. Thus a canal had to be dug to provide water supply from the river Leine, some kilometers upstream from S√ºlbeck. Water was tapped off the Leine at Hollenstedt, about 6,5 km upwards and following the rim of the Leine valley around the villages St√∂ckheim and Dr√ºber. At the edge of the current village square the canal made a 90¬∞ bend from south to east and the water flowed back into the river Leine about 1 km downstream. About 100 soldiers dug the canal, called \\"Salzgraben\\" (salt canal) by the locals at a total construction time of two years. A large undershot waterwheel, installed on the current village square, drove the pumps. A stylized water wheel is now an integral part of the local coat of arms. Also at the present village square in S√ºlbeck a brine supply tower was built, from which the brine flew onto the graduation towers. In 1689 the industrial plant started operation.Gernot Schmidt: Das l√∂bliche Saltzwerck zu S√ºlbeck. p. 22 Very soon more buildings were added such as a second graduation tower.  Remaining buildings  The Upper Drilling Derrick is located in a half timbered building and was restored by a local initiative from 2006 until 2009 and is a Museum since. The Lower Drilling Derrick, directly adjacent to the Brine Reservoir, is still operating and is pumping brine. A small timbered structure was erected over the first brinewell in 1668 which survived until the 1960 and was taken away than to make room for a wider road intersection at Solstra√üe and Severshuser Weg. It was called \\"Solhaus\\" and reconstructed a few meters from the original site in 1992. Administration building \\"Faktoreihaus\\" from 1694 The old administrative building, Faktoreihaus, of the than state owned salt works was constructed in 1694. It is located on Solstra√üe and survives in only slightly altered form. On the right hand side of the building is the chapel used for church services until today (2014). The protruding part of the office building was made so that the officers had a good view of the works area. The building got it¬¥s present form after a rebuild in 1910.Gernot Schmidt: Das l√∂bliche Saltzwerck zu S√ºlbeck, p. 173 There are a few other buildings around Salinenplatz which have been erected in conjunction with the salt works.  Infrastructure connected with the Saltworks   Harbour  The transport of the fuel necessary to boil the brine, at first wood, was performed with horse cart. The supply of fuel was the biggest cost element in the operation. Wood was transported from as far as the Harz Mountains. Later the salt works were privatized and used coal as fuel. It had by then access to the newly built railway line which connects Hannover with Kassel, about 3 km away. Consequently, in 1883 the canal was widened east of the present village square in S√ºlbeck to build a little harbor.Gernot Schmidt: Das l√∂bliche Saltzwerck zu S√ºlbeck. p. 91 The area has been built over since 2010. At first the barges were hauled up the canal by horses. In 1886 a small tug was obtained that towed the barges loaded with coal from Salzderhelden to S√ºlbeck. Two locks were built on the Salzgraben to bridge the height difference between Leine and Salzgraben close to the outflow back into the Leine river. Later the first tug \\"Theodor\\" was exchanged against the stronger \\"Grubenhagen\\". After an arial cableway had been built the traffic with barges was given up. The rudder of one of the barges is preserved in the museum. The Salzgraben was filled in during the 1970s during the construction of the flood retention basin Salzderhelden. Brine Reservoir, built in 1882  Arial cableway  During 1908 construction began for an arial cableway to transport coal from the railway station of Salzderhelden to S√ºlbeck.Gernot Schmidt: Das l√∂bliche Saltzwerck zu S√ºlbeck. p. 92 The cableways starting point was close to the railway station in Salzderhelden. From there it ran through the meadows between Salzderhelden and S√ºlbeck and reached its end point at the current village square in S√ºlbeck after crossing the Salzgraben very close to its end point. This cableway remained in service until the Salt works closed operation in 1950 after a bankruptcy. After that many of the buildings were dismantled. The concrete foundations of the cableway can be seen in the meadows as of 2013.  Electricity and telephone  In 1899 a small hydroelectric power station with two turbines was installed in S√ºlbeck which used the water of the Salzgraben. In the villages S√ºlbeck and neighbouring Dr√ºber electricity was supplied from December 22, 1899 onwards. Shortly after Vogelbeck on the other side of the river Leine was connected, on Juli 1, 1903 St√∂ckheim followed. The city of Northeim received electric power only in 1912. In 1894 a telephone line was installed between Hollenstedt and S√ºlbeck, the first in the area. It was used for communication about the regulation of water supply through the Salzgraben between the two villages.  Narrow gauge field railway  On some of the pictures tracks of a narrow gauge field railway can be seen with a railroad switch on one end. When it was built and later removed is unknown.Gernot Schmidt, Das l√∂bliche Saltzwerck zu S√ºlbeck, pp. 177, 178, 179, 157  Recent history  On 1. March 1974 the village was incorporated into the city of Einbeck.  Politics   Village Council Dr√ºber/S√ºlbeck  Mayor of the village is Rolf Metje (SPD). The current legislative period runs from 1. November 2011 until 31. October 2016. There is a joint Village Council with Dr√ºber. The by-election on 20. January 2013 due to the incorporation of the former city of Kreiensen into the city of Einbeck brought the following results for the Village Council: *SPD 6 Seats *W√§hlergemeinschaft Dr√ºber-S√ºlbeck 3 Seats  Coat of Arms of S√ºlbeck  The coat of arms shows the water wheel of the former salt works and the Salzgraben that supplied the water to it.  Culture and Points of Interest   Buildings  The two Drilling Derricks of the historical salt works built in 1865 and 1882 and the brine reservoir built in 1882 are technical monuments since 1984.  Culture  Since 1989 a local initiative from the south of Lower Saxony organizes a series of concerts, which is known under the name of \\"Kultur im Esel\\". Esel (donkey) is the name of a former local pub. It is one of the longest running series of concerts in Lower Saxony. In the series the organizers try to give a stage to relatively unknown artist of different music styles. There are 10 ‚Äì 15 concerts per annum. During the season 2013 artists as Chris Kavanagh, Sally Barker, Vicki Genfan amongst others, are performing. The non-profit trust \\"Kultur im Esel\\" operates an event hall with more performances. There is regularly a \\"Low German Afternoon\\", where only the local vernacular, Low German, is spoken. S√ºlbeck has many clubs including a sports club, a brass band, a carnival club, and a choir. Heimatverein cares for the Upper Drilling Derrick and was instrumental in preserving it.  Economy  Brine is still produced from a well in S√ºlbeck.

After publishing a novel, The Gab Boys, in 1967, Duodu went on to a career as a journalist and editorialist.Anderson Brown, \\"Duodu's Gab Boys\\", 8 July 2008.

The Gab Boys (1967) and creative writing In 1967, Duodu's novel The Gab Boys was published in London by Andr√© Deutsch. The \\"gab boys\\" of the title ‚Äì so called because of their gabardine trousers ‚Äì are the sharply dressed youths who hang about the village and are considered delinquent by their elders. The novel is the story of the adventures of one of them, who runs away from village life, eventually finding a new life in the Ghana capital of Accra.Hans M. Zell, Carol Bundy & Virginia Coulon (eds), A New Reader's Guide to African Literature, Heinemann Educational Books, 1983, p. 133. According to one recent critic, \\"Duodu simultaneously represents two currents in West African literature of the time, on the one hand the exploration of cultural conflict and political corruption in post-colonial African society associated with novelists and playwrights such as Chinua Achebe and Ama Ata Aidoo, and on the other hand the optimistic affirmation of African cultural strengths found in poets of the time such as David Diop and Frank Kobina Parks. These themes come together in a very compassionate discussion of the way that individual people, rich and poor, are pushed to compromise themselves as they try to navigate a near-chaotic transitional society.\\" In June 2010 Duodu was a participant in the symposium Empire and Me: Personal Recollections of Imperialism in Reality and Imagination, held at Cumberland Lodge, alongside other speakers who included Diran Adebayo, Jake Arnott, Margaret Busby, Meira Chand, Michelle de Kretser, Nuruddin Farah, Jack Mapanje, Susheila Nasta, Jacob Ross, Marina Warner, and others.\\"Empire and Me: Personal Recollections of Imperialism in Reality and Imagination 16th to 18th June 2010\\".

It will be carried on Triomphant-class submarines. The TNO is intended to replace the currently deployed TN 75 warhead. Its commissioning was planned for 2015, when France's newest submarines, either Le Terrible or Le Vigilant, will be one of the first to carry the warhead.  Yield  The TNO has a yield that is estimated to be 100 kilotons of TNT (kt). The warhead's charge is called \\"robust\\": less optimized than the TN 75 but with an improved reliability and life-span. Development of the technology in the warhead has benefited from the final series of French nuclear tests conducted in 1995-1996 in Moruroa, French Polynesia. The warhead's design and functionality were ultimately validated through simulation, particularly with DAM's Tera 100 supercomputer, Megajoule laser, and radiographic equipment. Production of the TNO is estimated to be complete, although it is not yet in France's operational stockpile of nuclear weapons.

Created in honor of the 15th anniversary of the Tekken game series and is available with permission from Bandai Namco in the online version of the magazine Ultra Jump. March 19, 2010 published the first printed volume manga. Story based on the manga storyline in Tekken 6, but with some differences. For example, in the early chapters focuses more on Asuka Kazama and Lili, and Mishima family is mentioned only in the first chapter. In addition, there are elements in the manga such as fan service and comedy scenes.  Story  Jin Kazama, the owner of the powerful Japanese corporation Mishima Zaibatsu, declares war on the entire world. Nations that sided with the corporation merged into one independent nation, destroying any opposition. A year later, the Mishima Zaibatsu organization opens \\"The King of Iron Fist Tournament\\", declaring that the victor will be guaranteed a great prize. However, the tournament is interrupted by the appearance of Asuka Kazama who attacks Jin and demanded that he must stop his despotic ambitions carried out through Mishima Zaibatsu. Jin then orders guards‚Äîled by Eddy Gordo‚Äîto remove her from the premises. Little does Asuka know that her actions eventually lead to very unexpected consequences later on...  Characters  In contrast to the game series, the characters and the connection between certain characters in the manga changed. For example, Lili is more than silly and whimsical, Leo is her servant rather old Sebastian and Alisa Bosconovich from the beginning manga acting on the orders of Jin Kazama.  Publication  The first six chapters manga were published on the official website of the journal Ultra Jump, starting from October 19, 2009 and published monthly (except for the first two chapters, which were published together, October 19, 2009). March 19, 2010 in Japan, published the first volume of manga, including the first 6 chapters.

The three digits of 969 \\"symbolise the virtues of the Buddha, Buddhist practices and the Buddhist community\\". The first 9 stands for the nine special attributes of the Lord Buddha and the 6 for the six special attributes of his Dharma, or Buddhist Teachings, and the last 9 represents the nine special attributes of Buddhist Sangha (monastic community). Those special attributes are the Three Jewels of the Buddha. In the past, the Buddha, Sangha, Dhamma, the wheel of Dhamma, and \\"969\\" were Buddhist signs. The movement has inspired strong reactions within and beyond Myanmar. In the international media it has received criticism. The Straits Times reported that Ashin Wirathu, the movement's leader, responded to recent anti-Muslim violence with pledges to work for peace but critics remain sceptical. Various media organizations have described the movement as being anti-Muslim or \\"Islamophobic\\". The movement's Myanmar Buddhist supporters deny it is anti-Muslim, with Bhikkhu Wirathu stating it is a protective movement about targeting \\"Bengalis who are terrorizing ethnic Rakhine (Buddhists)\\". Alex Bookbinder, in The Atlantic, links the movement's origins in a book written in the late 1990s by Kyaw Lwin, a functionary in the Ministry of Religious Affairs, and its precepts are rooted in a traditional belief in numerology. Across South Asia, Muslims represent the phrase \\"In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate and Merciful\\" with the number 786, and businesses display the number to indicate that they are Muslim-owned. 969's proponents see this as a Muslim plot to conquer Burma in the 21st century, based on the premise that 7 plus 8 plus 6 is equal to 21. The number 969 is intended to be 786's cosmological opposite. Wirathu Wirathu is regarded as the movement's highest protector. It has been reported that he advocates the boycott of shops owned by Muslims. Wirathu has himself stated that the movement has been treated as a scapegoat by being unfairly blamed for events like the 2012 Rakhine State riots, and maintains that \\"969 is not violent\\". The Asia Times Online has described him as a \\"complex figure\\" who demonises Muslims, but also protests police violence. An article in The Straits Times says a source indicated that Wirathu had changed his tone and \\"pledged to promote peace among religious communities\\". The cover story of the 20 June 2013 issue of Time magazine called Wirathu \\"The Face of Buddhist Terror\\". \\"You can be full of kindness and love, but you cannot sleep next to a mad dog\\", Wirathu said, referring to Muslims. \\"If we are weak\\", he said, \\"our land will become Muslim\\". \\"Some people misunderstood the title [of the Time article] ... seeing it as an insult to religion\\", said Dr. Yan Myo Thein, a political analyst. \\"They believe it‚Äôs equating Buddhism with terrorism\\". After the publication of the Time article, Wirathu denied responsibility for anti- Muslim violence. Shortly after, the June 2013 issue of Time featuring Wirathu was banned in Myanmar. Burma's government has objected to the magazine article. Authorities deny they are defending the monk, Wirathu, but said they were concerned the article could create problems after recent unrest between Buddhists and Muslims. Burmese President Thein Sein, however, has defended Wirathu, saying the monk's order was striving for peace and prosperity and that the report undermined efforts to rebuild trust between faiths. \\"The government is currently striving with religious leaders, political parties, media and the people to rid Myanmar [Burma] of unwanted conflicts,\\" he added. Wirathu has said that the Time article was not against Buddhism, just against him. In an interview with The Irrawaddy magazine, he also alleged Muslim extremists were behind the article and planning to wage jihad against Burma. Hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Yangon early in the afternoon on 30 June 2013 in a peaceful demonstration against Time magazine's article on senior monk U Wirathu and the 969 movement he leads. Marching monks held a banner proclaiming that U Wirathu is \\"Not The Terrorist, But The Protector of Race, Language and The Religion\\". Speaking to Mizzima News, one demonstrator, a 51-year-old office manager, said, \\"TIME Magazine is wrong. He [Wirathu] is peaceful. Every monk is a peacemaker. The Buddhist religion wants brotherhood with everyone.\\" In September 2014 Ashin Wirathu attended a \\"Great Sangha Conference\\" in Colombo organised by Bodu Bala Sena. Ashin Wirathu said that his 969 Movement would work with the Bodu Bala Sena. Initiatives The movement is seeking to draft a law that would forbid Buddhist women from marrying non-Buddhist men without the permission of local officials. Dhammapiya, a senior monk who helped write the original proposal for the laws, said they were meant to encourage peace between different faiths and to \\"protect\\" Buddhist women from being forced to convert to Islam when they married Muslim men. Government religious regulatory authorities, while supporting the protection of the Buddhist faith from perceived Islamic threats, reject the legal initiatives of the 969 movement and \\"prohibited the creation of formal organisations\\" based on 969 principles.

He was a member of the Janissary corps of the Ottoman army. In 1679, he was promoted to be the commander of the Janissaries (Agha of the Janissaries). Two years later, he was given the title of vizier. Beginning in 1683, the Ottoman Empire entered a long and disastrous war called the Great Turkish War. After the execution of Kara Mustafa Pasha in 1683 because of his failure, other pashas were appointed to that post in rapid sequence.Nicolae Jorga: Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches Vol IV: ,tr:Nil√ºfer Ep√ßeli, yeditepe Yayƒ±nalrƒ±, istanbul, 2009, , p. 199 Bekri Mustafa was the fourth grandvizier after Mustafa Pasha. He succeeded Aya≈ülƒ± Ismail Pasha on 30 May 1688 during the reign of S√ºleyman II (reigned 1687‚Äì91). The first problem he had to solve was a rebellion, which was aimed to reenthrone the former sultan Mehmet IV (1648-1687). With the support of the Janissaries, he defeated the rebels. According to historian Nicolae Iorga, 6,000 people lost their lives during the clashes between the grand vizier's army and the rebels. However, Bekri Mustafa Pasha was not successful against the advancing army of the Holy Roman Empire, and he was heavily criticized for being inattentive to state affairs.

Antisemitic boycotts are often regarded as a manifestation of popular antisemitism. 19th and early 20th century boycotts In Hungary, agitation for boycotts began in 1875 with an antisemitic speech from Gy≈ëz≈ë Ist√≥czy in the Hungarian House of Representatives. From the 1880s there were calls in some of the Catholic press for Jews to be boycotted. The government passed laws limiting Jewish economic activity from 1938 onwards. In Russia, after a series of anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire following the assassination of Tsar Alexander II, towards that end in 1880 they were forbidden from purchasing land or taking mortgages (see the May Laws). Quotas limited Jewish access to educational institutions and from 1892 they were banned from participation in local elections and could constitute no more than 10% of company shareholders. Nazi SA paramilitaries outside Israel's Department Store in Berlin, holding signs saying: \\"Germans! Defend yourselves! Don't buy from Jews\\" In 19th century Austria, Karl Lueger, an antisemitic mayor of Vienna who inspired Hitler,Fareed Zacharia, The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad, Norton, 2003, 2007, p. 60 campaigned for a boycott of Jewish businesses as a last resort for his party. Jews were only allowed to live in Vienna from 1840. An organization called the Antisemitenbund campaigned against Jewish civil rights since 1919. Austrian campaigns tended to heighten around Christmas and became effective from 1932.Bruce F. Pauley, \\"From Prejudice to Persecution: A History of Austrian Anti-Semitism,\\" (North Carolina, 1992), page 201. In Ireland, Father John Creagh in Limerick campaigned against the town's small Jewish community in 1904, leading to a boycott of Jewish businesses and the departure of the Jewish population from the town.Jews in Twentieth Century Ireland by Dermot Keogh, Chapter 2 In the Ukraine, there was a boycott of Jews in Galicia, alleging Jewish support for Poland, while Poles in Galicia boycotted Jews for supporting Ukraine. In 1921, the German student union, the Deutschen Hochschulring, barred Jews from membership. Since the bar was racial, it included Jews who had converted to Christianity. The bar was challenged by the government leading to a referendum in which 76% of students voted for the exclusion. In Quebec, French-Canadian nationalists organized boycotts of Jews in the thirties.  Fascist boycotts  The Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses in Germany took place on 1 April 1933 as a response to the Jewish boycott of German goods which had started soon after Adolf Hitler was sworn in as Chancellor on 30 January 1933.Berel Lang, Philosophical Witnessing: The Holocaust as Presence, p.132 It was the first of many measures against the Jews of Germany, which ultimately culminated in the \\"Final Solution\\". It was a state-managed campaign of ever-increasing harassment, arrests, systematic pillaging, forced transfer of ownership to Nazi party activists (managed by the Chamber of Commerce), and ultimately murder of owners defined as \\"Jews\\". In Berlin alone, there were 50,000 Jewish owned businesses. By 1945 they all had Aryan owners. In Poland, the Endeks (founded by Roman Dmowski) organized boycotts of Jewish businesses across Poland. Polish universities placed growing limits on the number of Jews allowed to attend,No Way Out: The Politics of Polish Jewry, 1935-1939. Hebrew Union College Press, 1997. Page 6.

In the USA, Nazi supporters, such as Father Charles Coughlin (an Irish immigrant), agitated for a boycott of Jewish businesses.

Political Situation and Capital Luhuti was a region of uncertain political status, known primarily from Assyrian inscriptions, and the stele of Zakkur king of Hamath. Luhuti is never attested as a kingdom of its own or as having a single central authority, although it did constitute an independent interconnected region. The Assyrian inscriptions that describe Luhuti as a country with many cities and troops. Luhuti had many cities. Shuksi was the maritime center, But the most important center and capital was the city of Hazrik (modern Tell Afis, Known as Hatarikka to the Assyrians), located 45 kilometer south of Aleppo. History Zakkur Stele Discovered at Hatarikka Luhuti was first attested in 870 BC. The inscriptions of Ashurnasirpal II record his conquest of its neighbour Pattin, then his use of Pattin's subordinate city of Aribua as his military base for operations against Luhuti. Ashurnasirpal devastated the country, impaled Luhuti soldiers on stakes outside their captured cities. By 796 BC Luhuti was incorporated into Hamath, forming the northern province of the kingdom. King Zakkur of Hamath titled himself King of Hamath and Luhuti. Zakkur was besieged in Hatarikka by a coalition of Syrian kings incited by Ben-Hadad III of Aram- Damascus, and led by a king descended from Gusi identified as the king of Bit Agusi, Zakkur survived the siege and commemorated the event by commissioning the Stele of Zakkur. Luhuti was attacked by Shalmaneser IV in 765 BC and Ashur-dan III in 755 BC. It was finally incorporated into Assyria as a province by Tiglath-Pileser III in 737 BC. Royal Family Hypothesis Hittitologists Trevor R. Bryce and especially John David Hawkins believe Zakkur to be a usurper, The Stele of Zakkur does not mention any royal ancestors. Hawkins believes that Zakkur was an Aramean usurper local to Luhuti who replaced the old Hittite dynasty ruling in Hamath.

Manicaland Province mobilized communities for cattle production in an effort to increase the national herd after devastating droughts and the country‚Äôs economic crisis. This would also address poverty issues in communities and enhance food security. Sadomba Project in Nyanga was one project identified by the province and was started by 29 members (19 women and 7 men) in Ward 24. Sadomba is a village in Nyanga District in Manicaland Province. The village is about 20 kilometres west of Nyanga town. Beginnings Community members came together and contributed one animal each to the project with the idea of starting a cattle fattening project. The members are newly resettled farmers who took advantage of their white neighbor farmer who was running a successful cattle project in the area. At provincial level, the Ministry of Women Affairs felt all the need to support the group for members had shown commitment after realizing a herd of 98 from such humble beginnings. The Ministry with various stakeholders like Agritex.Agritex Department of Livestock, Local Government, International Rescue Committee etc. held several meetings with the group in trying to assist members. Scaling up It became exciting to the province because all efforts to the projects were in line with the Rural Women‚Äôs Day. Theme of Poverty and Hunger Eradication. which recognizes rural women‚Äôs importance in enhancing agricultural and rural development which is exactly what the Project is aiming to achieve Head office visit The head office visit was an eye opener for the Permanent Secretary who had once visited a cattle project in the Victoria Falls by Allan Savory. She suggested the provincial team get a learning tour of Allan Savory‚Äôs project in Victoria Falls. A visit by the provincial team of Ministry officers, Officers from Agritex, project members (the rural Women) and local leaders was arranged for 10‚Äì14 August 2011 at the Holistic management center in Victoria falls. This was funded by the Ministry and IRC with the understanding that communities benefits when women actively participate in decision-making about community development priorities. After a week of learning Holistic Management by Allan Savory (at the Savory Institute) the Province decided to adopt the same concept for Sadomba cattle Project for they identified a lot of benefits coming with Holistic Management. Village set-up The Sadomba people are newly resettled farmers who were settled under the Zimbabwe land reform programme.Land reform program in Zimbabwe Many people have been settled in Sadomba under government's A.1 land resettlement scheme.  Benefits of holistic management  The Sadomba Community has since engaged itself in implementing holistic management as the programme is now being implemented in three villages. The whole idea for the Sadomba Community is now to have the best approach to managing resources that builds biodiversity, improves production, generates financial strength, enhances sustainability, and improves the quality of life for the community. The Province has cascaded this concept to all Districts in the Province.  Conclusion  This concept is now targeting the whole community and not only those women who started the cattle project.

His career is devoted to presenting the dynamic and complex world of astronomy to the general public, both as semi-fictional novels of past scientists and as popularised astronomy articles. Short biography Clark holds a first class honours degree and a PhD in astrophysics. He is a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and a former Vice Chair of the Association of British Science Writers. On 9 August 2000, UK daily newspaper The Independent placed him alongside Stephen Hawking and the Astronomer Royal, Professor Sir Martin Rees, as one of the 'stars' of British astrophysics teaching. Currently he divides his time between writing books and, in his capacity of cosmology consultant, writing articles for New Scientist. He writes for the European Space Agency where he was Senior Editor for Space Science for some time. Over the years Clark has written for amongst others: BBC Sky at Night, BBC Focus, The Times, The Guardian, The Economist, The Times Higher Education Supplement, Daily Express, Astronomy Now and Sky and Telescope. Until 2001, Stuart was the Director of Public Astronomy Education at the University of Hertfordshire. There he taught undergraduates, postgraduates and the general public, whilst researching star formation, planetary habitability and the origins of life. In a paper published by Science in 1998, he helped develop the current paradigm that the left-handed amino acids necessary for the origin of life on Earth were synthesized in star-forming regions spread throughout the Galaxy. In 2001, Stuart decided to increase his part-time writing to a full-time occupation. He remains a Visiting Fellow promoting the University and contributing to observatory open nights. Having crossed from mainstream science into science journalism, he now spends his working life translating astronomy, space research and physics into comprehensible language for the general public. Stuart has also been the accompanying astronomer on a cruise ship and on an eclipse tour to China. He frequently lectures to the public up and down the UK and, increasingly, across the world.

They also depended upon the support of some elements of the region's labor movement. From the 1910s through the 1970s, labor and civil rights were linked in complicated ways, with some unions and radical organizations providing critical support to struggles for racial justice, while others stood in the way. Seattle‚Äôs nineteenth century American population grew from a single person in 1858 to 406 women and men by 1900. Thee pioneers set forth the first black churches, businesses and civil rights organizations. History Segregationist Past For most of its history, Seattle was a segregated city, as committed to white supremacy as any location in America. People of color were excluded from most jobs, most neighborhoods and schools, and many stores, restaurants, hotels, and other commercial establishments, even hospitals. As in other western states, the system of severe racial discrimination in Seattle targeted not just African Americans but also Native Americans, Asian Americans, Pacific Islanders, people of Mexican ancestry, and also, at times, Jews. Individuals of African American descent were treated worse than any other minority based on the fact that there was a smaller number compared. During World War II, thousands of black migrants from the South began arriving in Seattle to find work in munitions factories and shipyards during the Second Great Migration. As a result, the number of African Americans in the city grew from 3,700 in 1940 to 15,000 in 1950 and the NAACP Chapter in Seattle grew from 75 members to 1,500 in 1945. Greater Seattle Housing Council In 1956, Seattle's Civic Unity Committee created the Greater Seattle Housing Council, intending to encourage dialogue between proponents of open housing (i.e. racially integrated housing) and the real estate industry. At this time, talks were fruitless. The following year, Washington State passed an Omnibus Civil Rights Act that provided that housing that had current federal or state government loans could not discriminate on the basis of race. In 1959, this was challenged in King County Superior Court.The Seattle Open Housing Campaign, 1959-1968 - Timeline, Seattle Municipal Archives. Accessed online 24 October 2007. The civil rights campaign in Seattle stepped up in October 1961, when the Seattle Employment Discrimination campaign urged selective buying with campaigns referred to as well a \\"shoe-in\\" and a \\"shop-in.\\" In this same time frame, the NAACP requested an open housing ordinance. The Seattle City Council convened a public hearing on the matter on December 11, 1961, but declined to act, recommending instead that supporters of such a law organize a ballot initiative. Rather than focus immediately on legislation, proponents of open housing pursued a different channel in the short run: in the summer of 1962, 24 organizations created the Fair Housing Listing Service (FHLS) to bring blacks who wished to purchase housing outside of Seattle's historically black Central District together with white homeowners willing to sell to minorities. By the beginning of 1965, FHLS negotiated 50 such sales. On December 17, 1962, the Mayor's Citizen's Advisory Committee on Minority Housing recommended that an open housing ordinance be submitted to city council, but the mayor and council delayed all action for a year. That year would prove eventful. The Urban League and NAACP resigned from the Greater Seattle Housing Council because they believed had been ineffective in housing matters. A new committee was formed, the Central Area Civil Rights Committee (CACRC). 400 people participated in a protest march July 1, 1963, and 35 youth from the interracial Central District Youth Club staged Seattle's first sit-in, a nearly 24-hour occupation of the mayor's office. That very day the city council and mayor proposed a Seattle Human Rights Commission, which was established July 17 (City Ordinance 92191). The commission was authorized to draft open housing ordinance. This did not prevent a July 20 sit-in in the council chambers. Public Schools On August 28, 1963, the same day as Martin Luther King Jr.'s March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, 1,000 demonstrators marched from Seattle's First AME Church to the Federal Courthouse. Also that same day, Seattle Public Schools became the country's first major school system to initiate a voluntary desegregation plan. A week later, September 3, 1963, the Seattle Human Rights Commission recommended an ordinance against discrimination in housing sales, rentals, and financing. Open housing bill An October 20 March in support of open housing drew 1,200 people. Five days later, the city council, meeting as a Committee of the Whole, held a public hearing on the open housing bill recommended by the Seattle Human Rights Commission. The bill was approved 7-2, but was stripped of the emergency clause that would have made a council vote sufficient to turn the bill immediately into law without the possibility of being overturned by a referendum. As would have been the case with or without an emergency clause, the Committee of the Whole sent the bill to the council as such (the same people) for a final vote. The two council votes against the final version of the bill were Wing Luke and Charles M. Carroll, both opposing it because the emergency clause had been taken out. On November 27, 1963 the council approved the bill (as Ordinance 92497) by the same 7‚Äì2 margin, without the emergency clause. On December 9, 1963, Ordinance 92533 submitted Ordinance 92497 to the voters by charter referendum as part of a general election on March 10, 1964. However, prospects did not bode well. On February 12, 1964 voters in nearby Tacoma, Washington defeated similar legislation by a margin of 3-1. On March 7, three days before the referendum vote, over 1,500 attended an open housing rally, marching from several places around the city to Westlake Plaza, but the March 10 election saw the ordinance go down to defeat, 115,627 to 54,448, as J. Dorm Braman, an opponent of open housing, was elected mayor of Seattle, defeating open housing supporter John Cherberg. Congress of Racial Equality In summer 1964, the Freedom Summer was occurring in Mississippi and (on July 2) President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In Seattle, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) initiated the Drive for Equal Employment in Downtown Stores (DEEDS), with a goal that minorities would constitute 24% of new hires in those stores. Through January 1965, these stores were subjected to boycotts. CORE also organized pickets and sit-ins at local real estate industry offices, but a court-ordered injunction terminated the latter protests. Freedom March Thirteen days after Bloody Sunday (March 7, 1965, when the Selma to Montgomery marches in Alabama came under violent attack), more than 600 people in Seattle‚Äîa group slightly larger than the Selma-to-Montgomery march itself‚Äîtook part in a \\"Freedom March\\" in support of the Selma marchers. Marching from the First AME Church to the Federal Courthouse, under the leadership of the NAACP, they demanded open housing legislation and equal job opportunities. Seattle's open housing forces took a blow when, on May 15, 1965, just before the summer of the Voting Rights Act and the Watts Riots, an airplane crash killed Sidney Gerber and city council member Wing Luke. Gerber had founded Harmony Homes, which by that time had built 15 homes for African Americans in previously all-white Seattle neighborhoods.Douglas Shaw Palmer Papers. 2006. 0.03 cubic feet (1 vertical file). Momentum was regained two years later, when on June 8, 1967 the Seattle Urban League initiated the three-year Operation Equality. Operation Equality provided counsel to minorities seeking housing, sponsored educational projects, and worked with fair housing groups to list available housing. It was the second such project in the United States to receive a Ford Foundation grant. Later that year, Sam Smith (politician) won a Seattle City Council seat in the November election, becoming the first African American to serve on the council. Civil Rights Act of 1968 On April 11, 1968, one week after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1968. Fair housing had become federal policy, and Seattle had lost its opportunity to get out in front of the federal government on the matter. Eight days later, on April 19, 1968, the Seattle City Council unanimously passed a fair housing ordinance (Ordinance 96619). This time, sponsored by Smith and five other members of the 9-member council, it passed with an emergency clause, making it impossible to appeal by referendum by the voters. Over the years, the legislation would be broadened further. In 1975, discrimination based on sex, marital status, sexual orientation, and political ideology were outlawed. In 1979, parental status was added; in 1986, creed and disability; and in 1999 gender identity.The Seattle Open Housing Campaign, 1961-1968, bookmark issued by Seattle Municipal Archives.

The hotel was established in 1840 or 1841; at a time when Calcutta, the seat of the East India Company, was the most important city in India. Referred to as \\"the Jewel of the East\\" in its heyday, Great Eastern Hotel hosted several notable persons visiting the city. After India's independence in 1947, the hotel continued its business and later the state government took over the management. In 2005 it was sold to a private company and was reopened in November 2013 after an extensive renovation. History The Great Eastern Hotel (Calcutta) in 1865 The British brought modern hotels to Kolkata. The Oldest was John Spence's Hotel. Spence's, the first ever hotel in Asia was opened to the public in 1830. The Great Eastern Hotel was established in 1840 or 1841 by David Wilson as the Auckland Hotel, named after George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland, then Governor General of India. Prior to opening the hotel, Wilson ran a bakery at the same site. The hotel opened with 100 rooms and a department store on the ground floor (Spence's Hotel, established in 1830 but no longer in existence, is considered to be the first major hotel in Calcutta). The Auckland was expanded in the 1860s and its managing company renamed from D. Wilson and Co. to Great Eastern Hotel Wine and General Purveying Co. It was also amongst the first to have an Indian on its board of directors, in 1859. It became the Great Eastern Hotel in 1915. In 1883 the premises of the hotel were electrified, thus probably becoming the first hotel in India, to be illuminated by electricity. Another image, taken between 1850 and 1870 During its heyday, the hotel was known variously as the \\"Jewel of the East\\" and the \\"Savoy of the East\\" and was prosaically described by Kipling in his short story City of Dreadful Night. It was said of the hotel in 1883 that \\"a man could walk in at one end, buy a complete outfit, a wedding present, or seeds for the garden, have an excellent meal, a burra peg (double) and if the barmaid was agreeable, walk out at the other end engaged to be married\\". The hotel has housed many famous personalities including Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin, Elizabeth II, Mark Twain, Dave Brubeck and possibly Ho Chi Minh. The management of the hotel was taken over by the state government in the 1970's and continued operations for over 30 years. The state sold it to the private group The LaLiT Hotels, Palaces and Resorts in 2005. Until its closure for restoration in 2005, the hotel was the longest continuously operating hotel in Asia. Renovation going on after it was taken over by LaLiT The hotel remained closed for a number of years for extensive renovations. It reopened with a soft launch as The LaLiT Great Eastern Hotel on 19 November 2013. The building is registered as a heritage structure and the renovations maintained essential features of the building, such as its facade and the grand staircase. The hotel has been divided into three parts - Heritage I, Heritage II and New Block.
