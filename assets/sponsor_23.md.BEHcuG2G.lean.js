(This obituary erroneously states that Wasserman received his M.S. in 1951 ‚Äî the correct year is 1950.) Biography After graduating from high school in Schenectady, Wasserman matriculated in June 1943 at Union College, where he studied for three months before joining the Army Specialized Training Program and then the U. S. Army for basic training. In October 1944 he was sent overseas, where in December 1944 his division participated in operations of the Battle of the Bulge. After military service in WWII, he spent a year working on a farm in upstate New York and then matriculated at Cornell University. There he graduated with a bachelor's degree in microbiology in 1949. After a year at Michigan State University, where he graduated in August 1950 with a master's degree in microbiology, Wasserman returned to Cornell University. There he graduated in 1953 with a Ph.D. in nutritional microbiology. From 1953 to 1957, Wasserman was employed at the University of Tennessee's Atomic Energy Commission facility, where he worked on the radiation biology program with Dr. Cyril L. Comar (1914‚Äì1979), the program's director. In spring 1958, Wasserman returned to Cornell University as an associate professor in the New York State College of Veterinary Medicine's newly created Laboratory of Radiation Biology. Comar, who had moved to Cornell, in 1957 was the Laboratory's director. Wasserman was promoted in 1963 to full professor and eventually retired from Cornell as professor emeritus. In the 1990s, his laboratory made pioneering studies using ion microscopic imaging of calcium. He suggested \\"the presence of a vitamin D induced calcium channel in the intestine (later identified as the vitamin D regulated epithelial calcium channel, TRPV6).\\" Wasserman was a member of the editorial boards of the Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine, The Cornell Veterinarian, Calcified Tissue International, and the Journal of Nutrition. He was the author or co-author of more than 360 research articles, including 14 papers in Science and 7 papers in Nature. Wassermann was on sabbatical leave at the University of Copenhagen in 1964‚Äì1965, the University of Leeds in 1972, Woods Hole Marine Biological Laboratory in 1981, and the National Institute on Aging in 1982‚Äì1983. He participated in over 40 international conferences on calcium metabolism, bone health, calcification, and vitamin D. Robert Wasserman married Marilyn Joyce Mintz in 1950 in Ithaca. He was predeceased by his wife after 63 years of marriage. Upon his death he was survived by three daughters and four grandchildren.

A 'pioneer of social groupwork as a vehicle for social education,' her 1946 work Informal Education was the 'first text to deliberately employ the term' and the first solo-authored work on the subject.  Life and work  St Woolos School, Newport, which Josephine Macalister Brew attended as a child. Josephine Macalister Brew was born Mary Winifred Brew in Llanelli, Wales, the daughter of Frederick Charles Brew, a boot and shoe dealer. She studied history at the University of Wales, Aberystwyth, and graduated in 1925, after which she became a history teacher at Shaftesbury High School for Girls, Dorset. In 1932, Brew moved to Cardiff to study for her Doctor of Law. In Cardiff, Brew began her lifelong involvement in youth and community work, working with the Butetown Women and Girls' Club, and South Wales educational settlements. She later became a youth officer in Lincoln, where she acted as secretary of the Lincoln Federation of Girls Clubs. Subsequently, Brew served on the executive committee of the National Association of Girls' Clubs (later the National Association of Girls' Clubs and Mixed Clubs) for whom, following a comparatively short period as youth officer for Oldham, she was appointed Education Secretary in 1942. Among her colleagues there were Eileen Younghusband and Pearl Jephcott. The National Association of Girls Clubs and Mixed Clubs boasted, in 1944, 108,000 affiliated clubs, described as 'a training-ground for citizenship, giving a foretaste of the responsibilities and joys of an adult life, as well as an experience of community life.' Brew herself was a vocal advocate of mixed clubs, arguing for their benefits to young people and the society in which they lived. Brew also played a key role in creating the pilot Girls' Award (launched in 1958), part of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme, initiated two years earlier in 1956. As well as active youth work, Brew was a sought after speaker, and contributor to numerous publications. These included pieces for the Times Educational Supplement, as well as national newspapers. Brew's writing has been described as having 'a characteristic flowing style that moves between erudition and the plain talking of a sensible aunt.'  Philosophy  Brew believed that society had a responsibility to prepare its young people for their role as future citizens in a rapidly changing world. In 'Why Clubs at All?' (1943), she argued that: > They are the citizens of tomorrow, and to them the community has a double > responsibility. Firstly, to provide each one of them with the possibilities > of full and harmonious development, and secondly, to try to ensure that they > are fitted to be members of the community of the future. In her preface to Informal Education, published in 1946, Brew wrote: > Perhaps nothing will matter more in the next fifty years than the ability of > the common man to adapt himself to the changing world - a world in which > material prosperity may be just around the corner, but where there are still > vast acreages of barren land in the intellectual, emotional and spiritual > field. For Brew, the function of youth work was educating 'individual personalities with powers of judgment who will indulge in group living in the service of a social ideal'. She believed that involvement in youth clubs, and opportunities for association with others, would best equip young people for the requirements of active citizenship; that 'it is in the interplay of social relationships that real and full individuality is attained'. This preparation would act as a counterbalance to a society in which, Brew wrote, 'we educate our children for the first fourteen years of their life as though there were no such thing as industry, and then surrender them to industry as though education had never been.' Brew also believed that, in light of 'much social injustice and many intolerable circumstances', the aim of club leaders should be social reform. In Clubs and Club Making, she argued that: > If young people are to become fully alive to their own powers and capable of > being responsible members of society, social conditions must not exist which > make that almost impossible. Thus the club leader must constantly seek to > persuade the wider community to fit itself to be the kind of society in > which these young people can grow up to enter into full citizenship.  Death and legacy  Josephine Macalister Brew died on 30 May 1957 at Woodford Green, Essex. A funeral service was held at the City of London Crematorium on 3 June. In an obituary in Nature, John Wolfenden wrote that 'there can be few people who have lived so fully, so usefully, or so serviceably' as Brew. 'She would', he concluded, 'prefer to be remembered as one who never lost her astringent affection for hundreds of 'crazy mixed-up kids'.' Dame Isobel Cripps described Brew as a 'constructive force', whose 'great gift to us all is that she has built into the fibre of our nation something which will live on in the generations to come.' On 13 June 1957, as part of the Queen's Birthday Honours, Brew was appointed CBE.

It went through various changes in extent before being absorbed into other districts. Congo Free State Article 3 of the decree of 16 April 1887 provided for the Congo Free State to be divided into administrative districts headed by district commissioners, assisted by one or more deputies. The decree of 1 August 1888 divided the Congo Free State into eleven districts, including Aruwimi-Uele District with its headquarters in Basoko. A map of the Congo Free State in 1888 shows the district of Aruwimi and Ouell√© covering the northeast of the colony, bordering Stanley Pool District to the south, √âquateur District to the southwest and Oubandji and Ouell√© District to the west. The borders of the district are mostly straight lines through unexplored territory. The name comes from the Aruwimi River, formed where the Ituri River flowing west from the Lake Albert region meets the Nepoko River, and flowing west to join the Congo in the west of the district, and the Uele River, flowing through the north of the district and feeding the Ubangi River, which defined the boundary between the Belgian and French possessions. In 1895 the number of the districts was increased to fifteen. Aruwimi-Uele was split into two districts: Uele with headquarters in Niangara, and Aruwimi District, still with headquarters in Basoko. Uele was threatened by the Arabs, and was placed under special administration. An 1897 map of the Congo Free State showed the Aruwimi District along the Aruwimi River to the south of Uell√© District and to the north of the huge Stanley Falls District. The Aruwimi District had a long extension to the south of the Congo River along the west bank of the Lomami River, between the Stanley Falls District to the east and the √âquateur District to the west. Belgian Congo By 1910 the eastern arm of the district along the Aruwimi River had been absorbed into the Stanleyville District, apart from the lowest reaches, but to the south of the Congo River the district stretched south along both sides of the Lomami River. The district was bounded by the Bangala District to the northwest, Uele District to the northeast, Stanleyville District to the east, Kasai District to the southwest and √âquateur District to the east. The Aruwimi District became part of the Orientale Province created in 1914. It disappeared with the reorganization of 1933, absorbed into the Stanleyville District in the new Stanleyville Province.

Our contemporary Odysseys are redirected to the Apple Store, the palliative pharmacy, or forays along the River Amazon Prime. Guided by Google, whereby all things are knowable, we wonder why we are so absent-spirited, so lost, and so adrift. We may say that these secular surrogates, these 'isms,' constitute our values, our de facto religions, those in which we most invest our energies.

She is pouring nectar onto his wounds after which a scarlet anemone flower would spring up from his blood to his permanent memory. The nearby chariot is reminiscent of Pluto, representing a symbol of death. The two doves perched thereon are attributes of Venus. The story of Venus and Adonis, as narrated in Ovid's Metamorphoses, was a popular subject in Baroque times as an allegory for death and rebirth and had parallels with the Christian belief in Christ's resurrection.

Both teams compete in the NHL's Eastern Conference's Metropolitan Division. The Capitals and Islanders were rivals during the 1980s and early 1990s. Between 1983 and 1987, the two teams met in the playoffs with the Islanders winning all except 1986. The Islanders won the Division semifinals 3‚Äì1 in 1983, the Division Finals 4‚Äì1 in 1984, and the Division semifinals 3‚Äì2 after being down 2‚Äì0 in 1985. The Capitals defeated the Islanders in 1986 in a three-game sweep. In 1987, the teams had one of the most memorable playoff series in NHL history. The Islanders forced Game 7 after being down 3‚Äì1 in the series, a game which came to be known as the Easter Epic. In overtime, the two goaltenders, Kelly Hrudey for New York Islanders and Bob Mason for Washington went at it save for save, stopping all scoring chance the other team had. Finally, after three scoreless overtimes, Pat LaFontaine scored the winner at 8:47 of the fourth overtime period, giving the Islanders a 3‚Äì2 victory and a 4‚Äì3 series win in a game known as the Easter Epic. Six years later in 1993, the teams met once again, the Capitals finished second in the division with 93 points, six points ahead of the Islanders. Washington won the opener by a score of 3‚Äì1, before the Islanders won the next three games, all in overtime, including a pair in double OT to take a 3‚Äì1 series lead. Washington won game five to stave off elimination, but in game 6, the Islanders won 5‚Äì3 to take the series in 6. But, the win was marred as Pierre Turgeon suffered a shoulder injury of a vicious check by Washington's Dale Hunter after scoring a goal to clinch the game and series for Islanders. As a result, Hunter was suspended for the first 21 games of the 1993‚Äì94 season. Both teams met in the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs, with Washington winning the series 4‚Äì3. Since this series, the rivalry has been fiercely reignited, showing through the remainder of the 2010s into the 2020s. The rivalry became intense in the 2018‚Äì19 season. After the Capitals won the 2018 Stanley Cup, coach Barry Trotz signed for the Islanders, and Capitals' assistant coach Todd Reirden became the teams' head coach. Both teams finished first and second in the Metropolitan Division. Unlike 1988 when the Islanders won the Patrick Division while the Capitals finished second, the Capitals won in the division, and the Islanders finished closed second. The two teams met again in the First Round of the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, where the Islanders won the series 4‚Äì1. Following this series, Capitals head coach Todd Reirden was fired.

Smith (1911‚Äì1987) was an American herpetologist and data archivist and analyst.  Biography  Rozella Pearl Beverly Blood was an only child, born 18 May 1911 in Wichita, Kansas, to Charles Gillman Blood and Sarah Dorothy 'Dollie' Sherman. She died in Boulder, Colorado on 15 December 1987. Rozella Blood enrolled in Wichita High School in 1929 and then became a student at the institution then-called the University of Wichita, earning a B.A. in 1932 and an M.S. in entomology in 1933. She went on to attend the University of Kansas Medical School as a graduate student and assistant instructor in anatomy, neurology and histology, also working as a staff artist, from 1933 to 1937. After earning a teaching certificate in Kansas, she taught science and mathematics for a year at Altoona High School starting in the fall of 1937.  Researcher and teacher  In 1938, she married fellow graduate student and herpetologist Hobart M. Smith in Chicago, Illinois, and changed her name to Rozella B. Smith. They would go on to have two children, Bruce and Sally. Following the wedding, the pair left on a two-year research trip to Mexico, where they gathered more than 20,000 amphibians and reptiles, which were all preserved, tagged and transported to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. After the trip's conclusion, the Smiths moved to Washington for a year to oversee the integration of their specimens into the Smithsonian's collections. At the University of Illinois, she attended classes as \\"an unattached graduate student\\" from 1953 to 1961. Later, in 1963, she earned a second a Master of Science degree, this time in library science. Then, she earned a second teaching certificate so she could lead classes in ancient history for a year at the University High School beginning in 1965. After moving to Boulder, Colorado, in 1968, where she worked at the University of Colorado, she gave \\"guidance to undergraduates, graduates, and faculty members in her own and other departments, and to affiliates of the Center for Computer Research in the Humanities, in techniques of her special forte of fixed-field data processing and retrieval, and of correlation indexing.\\" In August 1982, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree from the University of Colorado in recognition of her work with undergraduate and graduate students.  Data analysis  Smith was working as head cataloger in the library of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, in 1966, when she began customizing new cataloging software on computers that had just been made available. She took on the job of digitizing the large quantity of data and graphics accumulated over nearly 30 years of collecting by herself and her co-author and husband. Throughout this time, supported from 1971 to 1985 with grants from the National Library of Medicine and several National Science Foundation divisions, she created the computational structures, input mechanisms, data analysis techniques and output documents. In so doing she provided essential information to her collaborator, H.M. Smith, who used her analytical results to evaluate his extensive research collection and publish more than 1,600 manuscripts, with many listing Rozella as coauthor.  Taxa  In her honor, several species- group taxa bear the name rozellae, including a subspecies of snake, Tantillita lintoni rozellae, 1940, and a species of lizard, Celestus rozellae, 1942.  Selected works  Rozella Smith was author or co-author of seven books and close to 70 articles, as well as many other projects that remained unfinished and unpublished, such as several data analysis works about Mexican herpetology. * Smith, Hobart Muir, and Rozella B.

The palace was first a castle, built in the early Middle Ages as the seat of the , but then became a Teutonic possession in 1219, and then seat of the . The castle became the residence of the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order in 1527 and remained the headquarters of the Order until 1809. History The history of Mergentheim Palace begins in the 12th century, when the Counts of built a castle on the east side of a village called Mergintaim. This castle was then obtained by the House of Hohenlohe, who expanded it. In 1219 the master of the castle, Andreas von Hohenlohe, joined the Teutonic Knights with two relatives and donated Mergentheim to the Order. This transfer to the was presided over by , Bishop of W√ºrzburg, and confirmed by Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor. Headquarters of the Teutonic Order Following the destruction of Horneck Castle during the German Peasants War and the secularization of the Teutonic state in Prussia in 1525, Grand Master Walter von Cronberg moved the headquarters of the Order to Mergentheim in 1527. 17 Grand Masters would govern the Order and its territories from Mergentheim until its expulsion in 1809. The palace was enlarged with Baroque additions and renovations in the 18th century. Secularization According to the 1797 Peace of Campo Formio, which concluded the War of the First Coalition, France was to annex the Left Bank of the Rhine and the German princes who lost territory to France were to be compensated with ecclesiastical possessions east of the Rhine. This compensation ballooned into the Reichsdeputationshauptschluss of 1802‚Äì03, which erased all ecclesiastical states except the Electorate of Mainz, moved south to Regensburg, the Teutonic Knights at Mergentheim, and the Knights Hospitaller at Heitersheim, all to be governed by German nobles. Just two years later in 1805, at the end of the War of the Third Coalition, the Peace of Pressburg gave Mergentheim fully to Austria. Austrian troops were stationed in the town until in 1809, at the end of the War of the Fifth Coalition, Mergentheim was mediatized to the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. Palace and grounds The palace comprises two ringed complexes, the inner residential and the outer administrative, that together cover an area of . The original structure was a 12th century castle that, beginning in 1568, that was expanded and rebuilt in the prevailing Renaissance style. The palace was again expanded, and remodeled in the Baroque style, by Grand Masters Francis Louis of Palatinate-Neuburg and Clemens August of Bavaria. Over several phases, the disparate buildings of the outer ring were joined into one. The palace is entered through a gatehouse, which is followed in the outer ring by the archive building, then the Trapponei, an administrative building. This is followed by the carriage house, the Bandhaus, the seminary, the rear gate, the Flughaus, riding hall, a barn, and finally the orangery. Gardens The western buildings of the administrative wing seen from the gatehouse Mergentheim Palace has had a garden since at least 1600, when a court garden was laid out on the southern and eastern edge of the palatial grounds. From 1739 to 1745, Grandmaster Bayern had that garden replaced with a French-style garden that included an orangery and a pavilion designed by architect Fran√ßois de Cuvilli√©s. This pavilion was demolished in 1823. In 1791, Grandmaster Maximilian Francis of Austria decided replace the existing gardens with an English landscape garden. The path the garden would be laid out around was completed in 1800, while work on the garden itself was completed by 1804‚Äì05. This garden also included two new pavilions completed in 1802. A portion of the palace gardens lies on the right bank of the Tauber, away from the palace.

Background  Messiaen became acquainted of Charles Quef, the then organist at the Trinit√© in Paris, in autumn 1929, which led him to give two small organ recitals in Tencin, just at the north-east of Grenoble. These were Messiaen's first organ recitals, which took place on September 15 and 22, 1929. The Diptyque was dedicated to two of the most influential composers and teachers of Messiaen: Marcel Dupr√© and Paul Dukas. It was premiered by Messiaen himself in a concert for Les Amis de l'Orgue on February 20, 1930, at the Sainte-Trinit√©, Paris. It immediately caught the attention of fellow musicians and was published shortly after that, in May 1930, by √âditions Durand, followed by some of his other compositions (the Pr√©ludes were released in June and the Trois M√©lodies in October). It was the only piece for pipe organ written by Messiaen published by Durand. Messiaen later became critical of his own earlier style. In an interview with Karin Ernst held on Octuber 24, 1977, Messiaen referred to the Diptyque as a \\"sin\\" of his youth.  Structure  The Diptyque is in one movement, in two sections that are thematically and formally related to one another. It has a total duration of around 13 minutes and is scored for solo pipe organ. The first section is a fast-moving prelude with a repeating seven-note motif. It is marked \\"Mod√©r√©\\" and is in the key of C minor. The time signature is . Unlike Messiaen's later style, neither the tempo nor the time signature present any changes in this section. The first section is meant to express \\"the anguish and useless torment of life\\". The second section, however, is marked \\"Tr√®s lent\\" and has a time signature of . According to Messiaen, it is \\"an adagio in C major, based on a single seren ascending phrase\\", which \\"expresses the peace and charity of Christian paradise\\". The second section of the Diptyque was rearranged for cello and piano for the last movement in Messiaen's Quatuor pour la fin du temps. However, Messiaen decided to use a much slower tempo on Quatuor: he marked it \\"extr√™ment lent\\" and slowed it down to ‚ô™ = 36, much slower than the ‚ô™ = 58 marked on Diptyque.

It went through various changes in extent. Between 1933 and 1963 it had roughly the same extent as the current Tshopo province. Congo Free State An 1897 map of the Congo Free State showed the huge Stanley Falls District where the later Stanleyville and Katanga districts would be created. A 1910 map of the Belgian Congo shows the Stanleyville District along the northeastern border of the colony, with Uele District to the north, Aruwimi District and Kasai District to the west and Katanga District to the south. It covers the region of the Congo River basin upstream from Stanleyville down to the northern border of Katanga, as well as most of the course of the Aruwimi River. Belgian Congo A 1914 map shows the district had been broken into a much smaller Stanleyville District and new Lowa, Maniema, Kivu and Ituri districts. These districts as well as Bas Uele, Haut Uele and Aruwimi constituted the Orientale Province, created in 1914. A map of the colony after the 1933 reorganization into six provinces shows that Stanleyville district was now part of Stanleyville Province, which also contained the reconstituted Uele District and Kibali-Ituri District. Stanleyville District had absorbed Aruwimi District but had lost some territory to Kivu District. Stanleyville Province was renamed Orientale/Oost Province in 1947. A 1955‚Äì1957 map shows Stanleyville District bordered by Mongala District and Bas-Uele District to the north, Haut-Uele District to the northeast, Ituri District and Nord-Kivu District to the east, Maniema District to the south and Tshuapa District to the west. The area was out of a total of for Orientale province as a whole. Post-Independance Orientale Province was broken up in 1963 into Kibali-Ituri, U√©l√© and Haut-Congo provinces. Haut- Congo corresponded to the former Stanleyville District. Orientale Province was reconstituted in 1966. It was renamed Haut-Za√Øre Province from 1971‚Äì1997, then returned to the name of Orientale Province from 1997 to 2015. In 2015 Orientale Province was broken into the provinces of Bas-U√©l√©, Haut-U√©l√©, Ituri and Tshopo. Tshopo roughly corresponds to Haut-Congo Province and to Stanleyville District as it was between 1933 and 1963.

The Unity 2020 ticket will consist of two candidates drafted from the left and the right who have agreed to govern as a team with the president of the ticket being chosen by a coin flip. They would try to make decisions by consensus and the president would only make a decision in a case that there could not be consensus or in the case of an emergency. Unity 2020 has currently selected Tulsi Gabbard and Dan Crenshaw to be the two candidates but neither person has yet to state publicly if they will run on the ticket. The movement planned to gain ballot access in all 50 states by working with third- parties that already have ballot access and running on their ticket. On September 26, 2020, Weinstein announced on his YouTube channel that they could not foresee a path to victory, and that they are pulling the plug on the 2020 presidential election effort, although the Unity movement will continue.  Beginnings  150px Bret Weinstein first proposed Unity 2020 by posting a whitepaper entitled \\"Articles of Unity: A Patriotic Plan To Save Our Republic\\" on the website Medium on June 29, 2020 that outlined the basic tenets of the proposal. The largest announcement was on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast episode #1494 on June 18, 2020  Motivation  According to Weinstein, The Articles of Unity and the Unity 2020 movement stems out of a concern that the current Democratic and Republican parties in the United States are consumed by extreme partisanship and show a lack of leadership at the highest levels of government. In an interview with the National Review, Weinstein argued that many Americans are concerned about corruption, unhappy with the options offered by the two party system, and that that there are a large number of Americans that fall into the ‚Äúexhausted majority‚Äù, which consists of Americans with political opinions between the far left and far right can form the base of support for the Unity 2020 movement for the 2020 United States presidential election.  Concept  Articles of Unity poster on lamp post, Los Angeles, September 2020 Bret Weinstein has discussed the Articles of Unity on multiple media outlets. The concept behind Articles of Unity, as described on its website, is that two candidates would be drafted from the left and the right. A coin flip decides who runs at the top of the ticket as president. When elected they would agree to govern as a team. Only when they do not agree or in the case of war or emergency can the president make a decision without consultation with the vice president. After four years, the president and vice president would trade positions. Bret Weinstein outlines three minimum criteria for the two candidates, although he does not define the qualities in detail: # Patriotic # Highly capable # Courageous The Articles of Unity and the Unity 2020 movement claims that this plan can avoid being a spoiler for the 2020 United States presidential election because it disempowers both Democratic and Republican parties by drawing candidates from both sides of the political divide. There is also a fail safe; if there is no viable path to the presidency for the Unity 2020 ticket then the race will be suspended. They have publicly stated that their ballot access plan for all 50 states involves teaming up with third-party tickets that are already on the ballot and then running on the same ticket.  Articles of Unity and Unity 2020 in the media  Since announcing this on The Joe Rogan Experience, Bret Weinstein has appeared on many media outlets discussing the idea, such as the National Review, Rising, Tucker Carlson Tonight, the Triggernometry podcast, and others. Big Think and Reason have also published content about the idea. In August, Twitter banned the Articles of Unity account.

It is most commonly known as the likely predecessor to the family name of Donald Trump, President of the United States. Talk show host and comedian John Oliver brought attention to the name during an episode of his television program Last Week Tonight. History Author Gwenda Blair researched the Trump family origins, and identified Hanns Drumpf, an itinerant lawyer, who moved to Kallstadt in 1608. The spelling of his last name had changed by the end of the 17th century. Another early Trump ancestor that can be identified as using this alternate spelling is Johann Philipp Drumpft (1667‚Äì1707, parents or place of birth not recorded), who married Juliana Maria Rodenroth. In 2011, the International Business Times repeated an verified claim that President Trump's paternal grandfather Frederick Trump changed his name from Drumpf to Trump, possibly to avoid anti-German sentiment popular at the time. In 2019, German broadcaster DW Akademie reported from the Trump German ancestral home in Kallstadt that there were no more people with the surname, and that according to the city's transportation association, the spelling had likely been changed during the reign of Napoleon around the turn of the 19th century.

Family and life  The Cletcher family (sometimes also spelled Cletscher, Clisser, Clitsert, Clitchert, Cletzer, and van Cletcher) originally lived in Colchester, England. The family emigrated to the Low Countries in the mid-16th century, where Thomas Cletcher sr. registered as a burgher of the city of Antwerp in 1560. As a result of turmoil stemming from the Eighty Years' War between the Dutch and the Habsburg Netherlands, the Cletchers moved north in 1585 and settled in The Hague in the newly founded Dutch Republic. The son of Cletcher sr.‚Äìalso named Thomas‚Äìbecame a wine merchant in The Hague and married Tanneken van Bree in 1597; the couple welcomed their firstborn Thomas Cletcher in 1598 (sometimes styled as Thomas Cletcher jr. to distinguish him from his father and grandfather). Thomas grew up in an upper middle class household with at least one brother, the cartographer, painter and printer Dani√´l Cletcher (c.1599‚Äì1632). He lived with his parents until 1625, when he married Anna Ghijsberti, a jeweller's daughter from Antwerp. After Anna's death in 1638, Thomas married Adriana van der Willigen in 1639, the widow of Hendrick van Wouw, the son of the mayor of The Hague. But Adriana died only one year after the wedding, and Thomas remarried a third time in 1642; this time the bride was Anna Hoeufft, daughter of a Dordrecht noble and merchant. Marriage into the Hoeufft family increased Thomas' reputation, but he would ultimately outlive even his third wife by two years.  Jeweller and goldsmith  The Three Brothers jewel, which Henrietta Maria possibly sold or pawned to Cletcher in the 1640s Thomas Cletcher is known to posteriority mostly through his profession as a jeweller, goldsmith, and gem dealer. In 1626, he designed a piece of jewellery in the shape of a branch of the Polygonatum plant, also known as 'Solomon's Seal'. The piece caught the attention of Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, at the time Stadtholder of The Hague, who agreed to buy it for the large sum of 27,000 guilders. As a result of his prowess, Cletcher became Dean of the Guild of Gold- and Silversmiths in 1630 at the age of only 32, a position which he skillfully leveraged to make connections with various European noble houses. Possibly due to his English ancestry, he developed a long-lasting connection with the English royal house, but was equally sought-after by other monarchs as an appraiser, intermediary in gem trades, and buyer of jewels that they wanted to pawn or sell. Cletcher kept extensive notes on his trades and produced drawings of the most notable objects, the majority of which survived and are held today by the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam. In 1625, Cletcher was the agent of choice when Charles I of England sent his wife Henrietta Maria to the continent to pawn away what she could of the English crown jewels in order to alleviate Charles' financial troubles. Henrietta Maria traded one of England's most impressive pieces of jewellery‚Äìthe hat jewel known as the Mirror of Great Britain‚Äìto Cletcher, who recorded the item in his sketchbook with the note that it had been \\"commissioned by Coninc Jacobus\\" (Charles' predecessor James VI and I). The Mirror consisted of three large diamonds, an equally large ruby, and hanging underneath, one of the largest cut diamonds that existed in Europe at the time, the 55-carat Sancy. While Charles was able to redeem the Sancy some 13 years later in 1639, the Mirror was broken up by Cletcher and never returned to England. Comparison between a copy of the Beau Sancy diamond and Cletcher's 1644 sketch Over the next decades, Cletcher became a major force in the Northern European market for diamonds and jewellery. It has been speculated that Cletcher was the buyer or middleman when Henrietta Maria attempted to pawn the Three Brothers in 1643/44 in an attempt to finance Charles' army in the First English Civil War. The Brothers were a crown jewel that was already 250 years old by then, and which had been owned by Duke John the Fearless, banker Jakob Fugger and Queen Elizabeth I. The jewel is considered lost since 1645, and might have been sold or broken up by Cletcher after acquiring it. In 1644, he engineered the purchase of the 35-carat Beau Sancy diamond‚Äìthe smaller sibling to the Sancy‚Äìfrom the estate of the late Marie de' Medici by Frederick Henry, whose appetite for luxury had grown with the successes of the Dutch Republic. Cletcher brought the Prince in contact with an Italian gem dealer living in Amsterdam, who received 80,000 guilders for the Beau Sancy. Cletcher recorded the transaction with great satisfaction in his notebook, as he believed the jewel to in fact be worth 150,000 guilders, making the sale a true bargain for his benefector Frederick Henry. In 1652, Cletcher sold a pearl necklace to his regular customer Henrietta Maria, who at this point lived in exile in Paris after the execution of her husband Charles I. In addition to his activities as a jeweller, Cletcher was also a skillful investor in schemes such as the draining of marshland in the Poitou region of France, milling in Sweden, and various real estate purchases. While his family assets are recorded as 6,000 guilders in 1627, by 1654 this had grown to over 90,000 guilders.  Public service and later life  The Municipality of The Hague, by Cornelis van Ceulen (1647). Cletcher is sixth from the right. Cletcher received his first appointment to the Hague city council in 1643, which might have been helped by his marriage into the noble Hoeufft family. His first term as alderman of the council began in 1645, a position to which he was reelected several times, before ultimately becoming mayor of The Hague in 1652. The mayorship was a highly prestigious post, and would have been considered the crowning achievement of a burgher's life. Cletcher served as mayor until 1657, when he retired from his business; he moved to nearby Amersfoort in 1659, where his son Thomas was mayor. Cletcher died in Amersfoort on 2 June 1666. From his first marriage with Anna Ghijsberti, Cletcher had five children: * Thomas, later mayor of Amersfoort. * Hendrik, secretary at the Dutch embassy in Sweden. * Robert, painter and member of the Confrerie Pictura in The Hague. * Anna, who married Otto Viglius, the commissioner for the region of Friesland in the States General of the Netherlands. * Jacob, who died as a young man after his marriage in 1647.

He was a younger brother of New York Governor Hugh Carey. Early life Carey was born in Brooklyn, New York on March 23, 1922. He was the second youngest of six sons born to Margaret (n√©e Collins) Carey and Dennis Joseph Carey Sr. Among his siblings were brothers, Edward M. Carey (president of Carey Energy Corporation), Dennis J. Carey Jr. (president of the family firm), Hugh L. Carey (a former U.S. Representative who served as Governor of New York from 1975 to 1982), John R. Carey and George G. Carey. His younger brother, George, a securities analyst, was killed in a plane crash in 1959. He attended St. Augustine's School in the Bronx and St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens before attending St. John's University. In 1942, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy during World War II, where he earned the honor of being the youngest Naval Captain during the war. He served as captain of an oil tanker transporting gasoline for the Army between England and France. Career After returning from the Western Front he attended Fordham University and became a marine manager and joined Peerless Petrochemicals (formerly Peerless Oil Company), the petroleum transport business founded by his parents, eventually becoming a partner and a harbor pilot. Carey later formed his own company, Marine Transport Company, known as MTC, with partner Raymond Connelly. MTC operated two barges and two tugs in the New York harbor. Carey was also the owner of the Petroleum Combustion Corporation, a company he acquired in 1955 that supplies gasoline octane boosters and other additives for heating oil. In 1975, Carey, who was described as short, dark haired and amiable, formed Petroleum Combustion International Inc. with Bruce Biersack to open a string of independent service stations known as Gas Value on Long Island. He also owned various real estate parcels ranging from the Matatuck terminal for petroleum products in Suffolk County and his family's summer home on Long Beach. A trained Operatic tenor, Carey founded the Brooklyn Opera Company. Historic preservation Carey's Winfield Hall in Glen Cove. Carey's Seaview Terrace in Newport, Rhode Island. Along with his wife Millicent, Carey worked to preserve and restore Historic mansions of the Gilded Age on the Gold Coast of Long Island and in Newport, Rhode Island. They bought a 22-room house in Lloyd Harbor, New York before purchasing Winfield Hall set on 16 acres in Glen Cove in 1978. Note: This includes and Accompanying 15 photographs The home, which is also known as the Woolworth Estate, was designed in 1916 by architect C. P. H. Gilbert for Frank Winfield Woolworth, reportedly at a cost of $9 million. Parts of the 25,668 square-foot mansion were heavily damaged by fire in January 2015. In 1974, the Careys paid $270,000 to purchase Seaview Terrace, the fifth-largest mansion in Newport built by Howard Greenley for Edson Bradley. They leased the Ch√¢teauesque main house, gatehouse and former stables to Salve Regina University, which renamed it the Carey Mansion. On August 31, 2009, Salve Regina University terminated the lease with the Carey family and the Careys' daughter began residing in the mansion. The Syfy network featured the mansion in the first season, second episode of its paranormal reality show Stranded on March 6, 2013. In 1975, when his elder brother Edward was asked during an interview about Martin's interests, he replied offhandedly, \\"Oh, he's in real estate and maritime transportation and he was making money renting out his house in Newport to make pornographic movies until the newspapers found out and it was stopped.\\" Apparently, after several neighboring estates, including Rosecliff, had been rented for the filming of The Great Gatsby movie, an agent offered Carey a similar deal. He agreed, but the renter turned out to be Gerard Damiano, the adult film director best known for the 1972 cult classic Deep Throat. Damiano filmed The Story of Joanna at the mansion before the Newport News revealed Damiano's credits and the filming ceased. In 1981, Carey purchased Bogheid, the 1938 mansion in Glen Cove that was designed by Delano and Aldrich in the French Manor style for Helen Porter Pryibil, daughter of New York City banker William H. Porter. He renamed the house to Cashelmara and used it as showcase for interior decorators. Later, the residence became vacant and fell into disrepair. The Society for the Preservation of Long Island Antiquities placed it on their list of endangered historic properties in 2010.

It is situated in the Cascade Range, north of Spirit Lake, and northeast of The Dome. Its closest neighbor is Mount Margaret, to the south, and the nearest higher neighbor is Mount St. Helens, to the south. Whittier is the second-highest peak in the Mount St. Helens area, after Mt. St. Helens. Although modest in elevation, relief is significant as the summit rises 2,000 feet above the head of Coldwater Creek valley in . Precipitation runoff from Mount Whittier drains into tributaries of the North Fork Toutle River. Geology The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity occurred. The lateral blast from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was pointed toward Mount Whittier and stripped the vegetation from its slopes. Due to Mount St. Helens' proximity to Mount Whittier, volcanic ash is common in the area. Mount Whittier and nearby Minnie Peak are composed of resistant granodiorite of the Spirit Lake pluton, which is a complex of once-molten rock that intruded the surrounding rocks approximately 20 million years ago. Patrick T. Pringle, ROADSIDE GEOLOGY OF MOUNT ST. HELENS NATIONAL VOLCANIC MONUMENT AND VICINITY, 1993, pg. 51. Climate Mount Whittier is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.

It is also the ninth book in the Gray Man series. In the novel, main character Court Gentry tracks down a global sex trafficking organization across eastern Europe. To date, One Minute Out is the first Gray Man novel to be written in the first person. One Minute Out debuted at number one on the New York Times bestseller list, making it Greaney's first number one solo entry. Plot summary Freelance mercenary Court Gentry is tasked with assassinating former Serbian general Ratko Babic at his compound in Bosnia and Herzegovina. While infiltrating his house, Gentry discovers that it is also a way station for young girls waiting to be transported east and sold into sex slavery. After killing Babic, Gentry manages to escape with one of the girls named Liliana while taking heavy fire from the general's men, leaving the other girls behind. Liliana informs Gentry about Captain Niko Vukovic, a police chief stationed on the nearby city of Mostar who is Babic's associate. After sending the girl home safely, Gentry goes to Mostar and surveils the police officer, later apprehending Hungarian mobsters sent to kill him. While there, he encounters Talyssa Corbu, a Romanian financial analyst working for Europol. She had embarked on a personal mission to find her sister Roxana, who is missing and presumed dead or sold into sex slavery. They agree to work together to save the trafficked girls as well as Roxana. Gentry snatches Vukovic and tortures him for information. The police officer reveals that the next way station or ‚Äúpipeline‚Äù for the trafficked girls is in Dubrovnik, Croatia, and that he works for a global enterprise called the Consortium, which deals in money laundering and sex trafficking. Gentry and Corbu then proceed to Croatia, where he uses her as bait to attract Consortium men by asking around about the organization. Eventually, Albanian mobsters working for the Consortium kidnap Corbu. Gentry then chases them through the streets of Dubrovnik, eventually saving the analyst and killing her captors. While captive, Corbu overhears of a Consortium hideout near the Croatian coast. They venture there, where Gentry finds a yacht where the young girls are being transported and decides to follow it. The Director of the Consortium, Hollywood-based businessman Kenneth Cage, sends security contractor Jaco Verdoorn and his men to Croatia in an effort to dispatch Gentry and Corbu. The former South African special forces member is also tasked with shepherding the yacht full of trafficked young girls to an auction in Venice, Italy. Meanwhile, Gentry infiltrates the yacht and finds Roxana, who now goes by the name of Maja and is selected as one of the VIPs to be personally delivered to Cage. However, she refuses to be rescued, vowing to help her sister identify the Consortium's top players. Gentry reluctantly leaves her, narrowly escaping the yacht while under pursuit from Verdoorn and his men. Court then tries to enlist the CIA's help for resources. However, his boss Matthew Hanley declines, claiming to have no knowledge about the Consortium and sternly telling him that he is needed stateside. Gentry then asks for help from an Italian crime family he had previously worked with in infiltrating the Venice auction, while he instructs Corbu to travel to the Netherlands and coerce a blackhat hacker into accessing the Consortium's financial records. Unknown to Gentry, Hanley sends a Ground Branch paramilitary team led by his former black ops team leader Zack Hightower into Venice to apprehend the mercenary. They soon get into a gunfight with Verdoorn and his men and are forced to move out. Gentry witnesses this and demands to know how Hanley knew his whereabouts. His boss replies that Cage is an important Agency asset and must not be harmed, but reluctantly allows Court to rescue Roxana and the girls as long as he does not kill the Consortium head. Gentry then joins Hightower and the Ground Branch team as they return to the United States. Corbu travels to the United States as well, where she tracks down a ranch outside Los Angeles where Roxana and the girls are being kept. At Hightower's recommendation, Gentry enlists the services of a group of veterans led by former Delta Force officer Shep Duvall, who used to raid brothels and rescue trafficked girls in the Philippines until they got caught, imprisoned, and later extradited to the United States. Together they storm the ranch, dispatching most of the security and rescuing the girls. However, Duvall is killed in the firefight, and Verdoorn manages to escape with Cage and Roxana. They later regroup to the Consortium head's mansion in the city. The next day, Roxana manages to inform her sister about her whereabouts. Court and Duvall's surviving teammates then stage an assault on the mansion. Gentry eventually kills Verdoorn after a brutal fight and catches up to Cage, who lets Roxana go. Court decides not to kill him and castrates him instead. Roxana and Corbu then reunite, as Gentry is picked up by Hightower and summoned for a new mission.

On how he came up with the plot, the author said: \\"The initial idea for this one began with me picturing the Gray Man on a vengeance mission for something far in the past, but in the process of discovering something unrelated, that‚Äôs bigger and more deadly. I soon decided on focusing on human trafficking after doing some research on the subject.\\" Reception=Commercial One Minute Out debuted at number one in the Combined Print and E-Book Fiction category of the New York Times bestseller list for the week of March 8, 2020, making it Greaney's first number one solo entry. His last number one was with co-author Tom Clancy in his final novel Command Authority (2013). In addition, the book charted at number four in the Hardcover Fiction category of the same list. The book debuted at number three on the USA Today Best-Selling Books list for the week of February 27, 2020. Critical The book received positive reviews. Publishers Weekly called it \\"memorable\\" and continued: \\"Gentry is up to the task. Spy thriller fans will be enthralled.\\" Kirkus Reviews hailed it, stating: \\"Great storytelling about the pursuit of extrajudicial justice.\\" Thriller novel reviewer The Real Book Spy praised the book's first person point of view: \\"Greaney‚Äôs style is unique, and allowing Gentry to speak directly to readers creates a powerful dynamic as fans will love hearing from the super-assassin and seeing the plot through his eyes. It all works incredibly well and is paired perfectly with the dark subject matter at hand.\\" References Category:2020 American novels Category:American thriller novels Category:Novels set in Europe ","title":"One Minute Out (novel)"},{"id":"65002184","text":"What Works Clearinghouse (WWC) is a digital library of educational research which focuses on evidence-based education.

Since the 1970s, Bourdeau has created large camera format images, which he methodically prepares from contemplating a site for a lengthy period before making an extended exposure that allows a maximum of detail. He is known for his technical perfection, and for the unique gold chloride solution that adds a warm tone to his silver gelatin prints. The Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century Photography calls his work remarkable for its rigorous consistency while the Globe and Mail in 2005 called his photographs of abandoned or inactive industrial sites and buildings of the past \\"beautifully precise\\" and \\"immaculate\\". The Calgary Herald, in 1989, said of a show of his work at the Glenbow Museum, that his work is \\"beautiful, meditative, alive with tonal richness and compressed details, and still in atmosphere, all in ways that reward long looking\\". Biography Bourdeau was born in Kingston, Ontario, in 1931. In 1957, he moved to Toronto for a year to attend the University of Toronto, before returning to Kingston. After coming across a copy of Aperture magazine, Bourdeau corresponded with then-editor Minor White in Rochester, New York in 1958, then met him, and for the next ten years, the two men were in contact. Bourdeau soon decided, encouraged by White, that taking photographs was the correct path for him, although he worked in a job as an architecture technologist (1960‚Äì1985). Another mentor was Paul Strand who he corresponded with, then met, in New York in 1965. With these photographers as mentors, he was drawn in his early work to modernism. He has also spoken of Paul C√©zanne and Giorgio Morandi as being influential. At first, his chosen subject was landscape which he photographed in black-and- white. His choice of scenes in Canada, Ireland and elsewhere were presented in luminous detail but gave the viewer not the surface but the spirit of the natural world. His work developed over time to a more measured, meditative view and he introduced architecture into his subject matter, preferably architecture which spoke to an historical time. Generally, his work is marked by a sense of growth and change. Bourdeau says: \\"I hold the conviction that emotional forces generated by a place can be made visible.\\" In 1966, he had his first exhibition in Canada at the National Film Board Still Photography Division and in 1969, the National Gallery of Canada acquired his work for the first time. Another breakthrough occurred in 1980 when Jane Corkin, who had an important photography gallery in Toronto, decided to represent him. Only in 1985 was he able to work at photography full-time. His commitment was crowned by success: in 1990, he had a retrospective at the National Gallery of Canada, Robert Bourdeau: Retrospective. That same year, he began his keynote series of photographs of industrial sites. He has exhibited his work widely throughout North America and Europe. In Canada, he has been included in photographic surveys at the National Gallery of Canada and the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography (now the Canadian Photography Institute or CPI) of the National Gallery of Canada. In 2016, Linda Jansma curated the exhibition Edge of the Visible for the Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa. In 2011, Robert Bourdeau: The Station Point, a comprehensive survey of his work, was published by the Magenta Foundation and Stephen Bulger Gallery. His work is in the collections of the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris; the Smithsonian Institution, Washington, DC; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; and The Renaissance Society, Chicago; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Los Angeles County Museum of Art; the Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto; the National Gallery of Canada, the Canadian Photography Institute, Ottawa; the Robert McLaughlin Gallery, Oshawa; as well as Library and Archives Canada, Ottawa and the Canadian Centre for Architecture, Montreal. Bourdeau taught photography at the University of Ottawa from 1980 to 1994. He currently lives in Ottawa.  Awards and honours  He was elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1983.

During World War II, she operated as the mother ship for a midget submarine during the attack on Pearl Harbor and the attack of Diego-Suarez, conducted a war patrol in the Indian Ocean, and served in the Guadalcanal campaign before she was sunk in February 1943. Design and description The Type C submarines were derived from the earlier KD6 sub- class of the with a heavier torpedo armament for long-range attacks. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of . They had a diving depth of .Bagnasco, p. 192 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater.Chesneau, p. 201 On the surface, the C1s had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . The boats were armed with eight internal bow torpedo tubes and carried a total of 20 torpedoes. They were also armed with a single /40 deck gun and two single or twin mounts for Type 96 anti-aircraft guns. They were equipped to carry one Type A midget submarine aft of the conning tower.Carpenter & Dorr, p. 104 Construction and commissioning Ordered under the 3rd Naval Armaments Supplement Programme and built by the Sasebo Naval Arsenal at Sasebo, Japan, I-18 was laid down on 25 August 1937 with the name Submarine No. 38. Launched on 19 July 1939, she was completed and commissioned on 31 January 1941, by which time she had been renamed I-18. Service history=Pre-World War II Upon commissioning, I-18 was attached to the Yokosuka Naval District, assigned to Submarine Division 2 in Submarine Squadron 1 in the 6th Fleet In the autumn of 1941, she underwent conversion into a mother ship for a Type A midget submarine. The submarines , , , and also underwent the conversion. By 15 November 1941, I-18 was a part of Submarine Division 3 ‚Äî which also included and I-20 ‚Äî in Submarine Squadron 1 in the 6th Fleet. At the Kure Navy Club in Kure, Japan, on 17 November 1941, the commander of Submarine Division 3 briefed the commanding officers of the five converted submarines on the upcoming attack on Pearl Harbor and on the role of their submarines in it. He had been designated the commander of the Special Attack Unit, made up of all five submarines, each of which was to launch a Type A midget submarine off Pearl Harbor so that the midget submarines could participate in the attack. I-22 was to serve as flagship of the Special Attack unit. On 18 November 1941, the five submarines moved from Kure to the Kamegakubi Naval Proving Ground, where each embarked a Type A midget submarine. At 02:15 on 19 November 1941, the five submarines got underway from Kamegakubi bound for the Hawaiian Islands, taking a direct route that took them south of Midway Atoll. While at sea, they received the message \\"Climb Mount Niitaka 1208\\" () from the Combined Fleet on 2 December 1941, indicating that war with the Allies would commence on 8 December 1941 Japan time, which was on 7 December 1941 on the other side of the International Date Line in Hawaii. World War IIPearl Harbor= At 02:15 on 7 December 1941, I-18 launched her midget submarine, No. 17, south of Oahu about from the entrance to Pearl Harbor. No. 17 was depth charged and sunk with the loss of its two-man crew outside the harbor in Keehi Lagoon. Its wreck was discovered resting in of water on 13 June 1960, and the United States Navy submarine rescue ship refloated it on 6 July 1960, finding no human remains inside. At the request of the Government of Japan, the United States returned the wreck to Japan, where it is displayed at the Naval Academy Etajima in Etajima. I-18 and the other four \\"mother\\" submarines proceeded to the planned recovery area for their midget submarines west of Lanai, where they spent the night of 7‚Äì8 December 1941. None of the midget submarines returned. Early on 9 December 1941, I-18, I-20, and I-24 received orders to leave the recovery area. I-18 departed the Hawaiian Islands on 12 December 1941 and arrived at Kwajalein on 22 December 1941. =First war patrol= On 4 January 1942, I-18, I-22, and I-24 departed Kwajalein to begin their first war patrol, assigned patrol areas off the Hawaiian Islands, with the commander of Submarine Division 2 embarked on I-18. I-18 sighted U.S. Navy Task Force 11, including the aircraft carrier , steaming west of Hawaii on 9 January 1942, and on 10 January, while northeast of Johnston Island, she sighted two SBD Dauntless dive bombers from Lexington flying west, allowing her to calculate Lexington‚Ä≤s approximate position and report it. On 18 January 1942, I-18, I-22, and I-24 received orders to depart their patrol areas, the orders calling for I-18 and I-24 to make for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and bombard Midway Atoll. On 24 January 1942, I-18 conducted a periscope reconnaissance of Midway, and on 25 January 1942, the two submarines surfaced in darkness off Midway to begin their bombardment. I-24 opened fire with her deck gun, and United States Marine Corps coastal artillery promptly returned fire, forcing I-24 to submerge after firing only six rounds. I-18 also submerged without ever having opened fire on the atoll. After the bombardment attempt, I-18 and I-24 as well as I-22 set course for Japan. Unknown to them, the U.S. submarine had received Ultra intelligence information alerting her to their activities and routes. She did not sight any of them, but while searching for them she encountered and sank the submarine , which was following the same route, west of Midway on 27 January 1942. I-18 arrived at Yokosuka along with I-22, I-24, and the submarines , , , and on 2 February 1942. =February‚ÄìApril 1942= After her port call at Yokosuka, I-18 moved to Kure, then departed Kure on 18 March 1942. She remained in Japan into April 1942. During I-18‚Ä≤s stay in Japan, the German naval staff in Berlin formally requested on 27 March 1942 that Japan begin attacks on Allied convoys in the Indian Ocean. On 8 April 1942, the Japanese formally agreed to meet this request by dispatching submarines to operate off the coast of East Africa, and that day they withdrew Submarine Division 1 of Submarine Squadron 8 from its base at Kwajalein to Japan. By 16 April 1942 they had created the \\"A\\" detachment within Submarine Squadron 8, consisting of I-18 and the submarines , I-16, I-20, and , as well as midget submarines and the auxiliary cruisers and , which were to operate as supply ships for the submarines. That morning, the commander of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Teruhisa Komatsu, the commander of Submarine Squadron 8, their staffs, and the midget submarine crews paid a courtesy call on the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, aboard his flagship, the battleship , at Hashirajima anchorage. After the visit with Yamamoto, the detachment got underway at 11:00, bound for Penang in Japanese-occupied British Malaya. During the detachment's voyage, 16 United States Army Air Forces B-25 Mitchell bombers launched by the aircraft carrier struck targets on Honshu in the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942. The detachment received orders from the 6th Fleet that day to divert from its voyage and head northeast, passing north of the Bonin Islands, to intercept the U.S. Navy task force that had launched the strike. The detachment failed to find the U.S. ships and soon resumed its voyage. I-30 and Aikoku Maru called at Penang from 20 April to 22 April 1942 before heading into the Indian Ocean to conduct an advance reconnaissance of the \\"A\\" Detachment's planned operating area. The rest of the \\"A\\" Detachment reached Penang on 27 April 1942, where the seaplane carrier ‚Äî which had undergone modifications allowing her to carry Type A midget submarines ‚Äî rendezvoused with it. I-16, I-18, and I-20 each embarked a midget submarine at Penang. =Indian Ocean operation= I-18 and the other \\"A\\" detachment units got underway from Penang on 30 April 1942, headed westward into the Indian Ocean with I-10 serving as the detachment's flagship. The submarines refueled at sea from Aikoku Maru and H≈çkoku Maru on 5, 10, and 15 May 1942. I-18 suffered a mishap on 17 May when her port diesel engine flooded in heavy seas and four of its cylinders seized, damage which prevented her from reaching the launch area for the midget submarines on schedule. I-10‚Ä≤s Yokosuka E14Y1 (Allied reporting name \\"Glen\\") floatplane began reconnaissance flights over ports in South Africa by reconnoitering Durban on 20 May 1942, followed by flights over East London, Port Elizabeth, and Simon's Town over the next week. On the night of 29 May, the plane flew over Diego-Suarez, Madagascar, sighting the battleship among the ships anchored there. The \\"A\\" detachment commander selected Diego-Suarez as the target for a midget submarine attack, scheduled for 30 May 1942. I-16 and I-20 launched their midget submarines off Diego-Suarez on 30 May, but I-18‚Ä≤s midget suffered engine failure and she could not launch it. After the midget submarine attack, the \\"A\\" detachment began anti-shipping operations. I-18 sank the Norwegian 2,158-gross register ton merchant ship Wilford in the Mozambique Channel at on 8 June 1942, then jettisoned her midget submarine on 9 June. On 1 July 1942, she heavily damaged the Dutch 1,805-ton merchant ship De Weert, and De Weert sank on 3 July at . On 2 July 1942, I-18 attacked the British 7,406-ton armed merchant ship Phemius. Her torpedoes detonated prematurely, and Phemius opened fire on I-18‚Ä≤s periscope. I-18 escaped undamaged. She was in the Indian Ocean south of St. Lucia Bay, South Africa, on 6 July 1942 when she torpedoed the 7,341-ton British India Steam Navigation Company steamer , which was carrying a large number of survivors of other ships. She then attacked Mundra with gunfire, sinking her at . One hundred fifty-five men survived Mundra‚Ä≤s sinking, which prompted a large number of Royal Air Force and South African Air Force sorties to find I-18, but I-18 went undetected. I-18 conducted a reconnaissance of Rodrigues on 20 July and of Diego Garcia on 31 July 1942, then proceeded to Penang. As she neared Penang on 2 August 1942, she detected an unidentified enemy ‚Äî probably Royal Navy ‚Äî submarine stalking her, but she arrived at Penang safely later that day. She later set course for Japan, arriving at Yokosuka on 23 August 1942 to undergo an overhaul. =Guadalcanal campaign= By mid-November 1942, the Japanese had decided to organize a system of submarine supply runs to Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands, where Japanese forces had been fighting in the Guadalcanal campaign since August 1942. With her overhaul complete, I-18 got underway from Kure on 17 December 1942 and, after a stop at Truk, proceeded to Shortland Island in the Shortland Islands to begin her supply runs. Early on the morning of 3 January 1943, the submarine sighted I-18 on the surface in the Solomon Sea southwest of Rendova at and launched a torpedo attack. Grayback‚Ä≤s torpedoes detonated, and Grayback‚Ä≤s commanding officer believed she had sunk I-18, but the torpedoes apparently exploded prematurely, because I-18 submerged and escaped unscathed. I-18 made three supply runs to Guadalcanal, in each case dropping her cargo off at Cape Esperance on the island's northwest coast. She delivered 15 tons of cargo in supply drums on 5 January 1943 and 25 tons in supply drums on 11 January 1943. On 22 January 1943, she departed Truk on her last supply run, delivering 18 tons of cargo in a supply container at Cape Esperance on 26 January 1943. On 28 January 1943, I-18 was attached to Submarine Force \\"A\\". She deployed to waters north of Rennell Island and south of Guadalcanal, where she formed a patrol line with the submarines ‚Äî which served as the force's flagship ‚Äî I-16, I-17, I-20, , I-26, , and , targeting any Allied naval forces attempting to interfere with Operation Ke, the Japanese evacuation of their forces on Guadalcanal. On 2 February 1943, Submarine Force A received orders to intercept a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier task force southeast of San Cristobal, but they failed to find the task force. The Japanese completed Operation Ke on 8 February 1943. That day, Submarine Force A received orders to intercept a U.S. Navy force south-southeast of Rennell Island. Two of the submarines, including I-18, found and engaged the American force before losing contact with it. Later that day, the commander of Submarine Force A ordered all its submarines except for I-11 and I-17 to proceed to Truk. =Loss= On 11 February 1943, I-18 reported sighting an American task force in the Coral Sea south of San Cristobal. An OS2U Kingfisher floatplane of Cruiser Scouting Squadron 9 (VCS-9) from the light cruiser sighted her about from the task force, dropped a smoke marker to indicate her location, and summoned the destroyer . Fletcher gained sonar contact on I-18 directly ahead at a range of and dropped depth charges at 15:27. At 15:39, she saw a large bubble of oil and air reach the surface, and she heard a heavy explosion at 15:43. She dropped three more depth charges in the center of the oil slick. After 15:46, she saw cork, wood, and other wreckage rise to the surface in what had become a very large oil slick. It marked the end of I-18, sunk with the loss of all 102 men on board at . The Japanese declared I-18 missing on the day she was sunk. She was stricken from the Navy list on 1 April 1943. After World War II, the U.S. Joint Army-Navy Assessment Committee identified the submarine Fletcher sank on 11 February 1943 as . However, RO-102 conducted patrols from Rabaul after 11 February and reported to Rabaul until 9 May 1943.

The bombing, carried out by officials of the Brazilian Army, was a false flag operation intended to frame left-wing guerrilla as violent and thereby slow the transition to democracy and the end of the military regime that began in 1964. One of the perpetrators of the attack died, while another was injured, from an accidental detonation of one of the bombs involved. A criminal inquiry from the time was inconclusive. There have been renewed investigations since 1999, one of which, conducted by the National Truth Commission, concluded that military authorities were responsible for the planning and execution of the attack. Background In April 1964 a coup d'√©tat overthrew elected president Jo√£o Goulart and installed a military government that went on govern the country until 1985. The first president in this regime, General Humberto Castelo Branco, who represented a moderate wing of the Brazilian military, was sidelined in 1967 by hardline president Artur da Costa e Silva, his successor.Teixeira da Silva, Ch. 9, p. 13 In 1968 president Costa e Silva and his ministers passed the Institutional Act Number Five (AI-5), an executive order that, among other things, suspended the right to habeas corpus and allowed the military to shut down opponents of the regime through force and suspension of political rights.Teixeira da Silva, pp. 13, 14 Under the regime an extensive national security network was established, composed of the National Intelligence Service (SNI) and the Center for Internal Defense Operations (DOI-CODI);Skidmore p. 209 the SNI was instrumental for the government to pursue a repression of opposition.Moreira Alves p. 53 The state DOI-CODI centers and the Center of Information of the Navy (CENIMAR) detained and tortured several regime dissidents as part of the Doctrine of National Security, a policy institutionalized by the army.Moreira Alves p. 128 The late 1970s and much of the 80s saw the rise of redemocratization movements throughout Latin America that sought to end the prevailing military regimes in the region.Teixeira da Silva, p. 2 The democratic cause in Brazil and all of Latin America was in part aided by U.S. president Jimmy Carter's promotion of human rights in his foreign policy. Teixeira da Silva, p. 3 In 1974 the newly-inaugurated Ernesto Geisel administration moved away from the authoritarian repression of president Emilio Garrastazu Medici's government, and towards a restoration of Brazil's rule of law. Additionally, that year the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB), the only legally allowed opposition party, had significant electoral victories. The global economic pressure also led to an internal crisis within the government. The interventionism and developmentalism that characterized the regime led to clashes during the Geisel administration (197479) between the nationalized industry sectors and the private multinationals, and divided the military into liberal and statist wings.Teixeira da Silva, p. 6 These events pressured the military government to slowly begin a strategy to transition Brazil back to a democratic system, a process that is known in Brazilian politics as the abertura (opening).Teixeira da Silva, pp. 3,4 In 1978 the government rescinded the AI-5 effective 1 January 1979, which opened the door for popular movements to protest the government without fear of retaliation.Teixeira da Silva, p. 25 Part of the abertura plan included the Party Reform Bill of 1979, which abolished the ruling pro-military party ARENA and the MDB and allowed the registration of new political parties. The bill was passed under protests by MDB members of congress, since it divided the anti-ARENA block into several parties and thus diluted the opposition.Moreira Alves p. 212 ARENA reorganized into the Social Democratic Party (PDS), while MDB chose to retain their identity by simply adding \\"party\\" to its name, thus forming the PMDB.Moreira Alves pp. 212, 213 Earlier attacks Despite the gradual process to redemocratize Brazil, several groups within the military mounted a resistance to the abertura, mainly those involved in suppressing dissidents through force and espionage.Skidmore pp. 226, 227Teixeira da Silva, p. 6 After Geisel was succeeded by Jo√£o Figueiredo, the last ruler of Brazil's military dictatorship, in 1979, the military made efforts to preserve their power by covering up the violence and tortures committed by the regime from its inception in 1964.Teixeira da Silva, p. 6 Clandestine acts of terror committed by army members and those linked to the military spiked in the late 1970s, 1980 and the early months of 1981.Skidmore p. 227 In 1976 the right- wing Brazilian Anti-Communist Alliance claimed responsibility for ten bombings that happened that year.Moreira Alves p. 221 In 1976 Bishop Adriano Hip√≥lito of Nova Igua√ß√∫, Rio de Janeiro was kidnapped by local members of the military and was targeted in a bombing in 1979. In 1978 and 1979 several terrorist attacks were carried out against members of the opposition in the state of Minas Gerais. According to historian Maria Helena Moreira Alves, the year of 1980 saw 46 acts of right-wing terrorism. Notably, in September 1980, a letter bomb was sent to the Brazilian Bar Association headquarters and left a secretary dead.Moreira Alves p. 222 On the same day the offices of Rio de Janeiro city councillor Ant√¥nio Carlos de Carvalho were destroyed. Timeline The Riocentro convention center, in Rio de Janeiro Throughout the evening of 30 April 1981, the Riocentro convention center in Rio de Janeiro's West Zone hosted a pop music concert organized by Centro Brasil Democr√°tico to celebrate Workers Day. Over 20,000 people were in attendance, and the event was headlined by many famous MPB artists such as Moraes Moreira, Alceu Valen√ßa, Gal Costa, MPB-4, Beth Carvalho, Gonzaguinha, Elba Ramalho and Chico Buarque.Ferron p. 149 On the afternoon of 30 April, Army Colonel and commander of the Rio police force Newton Cerqueira made a phone call to Lt. Col. Fernando Ant√¥nio Pott telling him to suspend policing of the Riocentro event for the evening and to keep 60 officers at the precinct alert for any emergency. At Riocentro, operations manager Maria √Çngela Lopes Campobianco reassigned Lt. C√©sar Wachulec from head of security to the tickets office, claiming he had issues with alcoholism. Outside of Riocentro billboard were graffitied with the acronym VPR (Vanguarda Popular Revolucion√°ria, a left-wing guerrilla group that had not existed since 1973). At around 9 pm, two cars were driven into the Riocentro parking lot, one of them a Puma GTE. In the Puma were two DOI-CODI officers, who planned to detonated a bomb under the stage of the concert. At around 9:15 a bomb went off prematurely in the car, killing Army Sergeant Guilherme Pereira do Ros√°rio, and seriously injuring Captain Wilson Luiz Chaves Machado. Machado was taken to Hospital Miguel Couto, where he requested that Captain Francisco de Paula Sousa Pinto be informed of the accident. Machado underwent surgery all night; according to an early medical report his condition was serious but not life-threatening. At 9:45, another bomb detonated at a nearby power station; the bomb was intended to cut off the electricity provided to Riocentro. Minutes later a Chevrolet Opala left the parking lot, with one of the passengers exclaiming to a security guard, \\"you haven't seen anything yet. The worst is going to happen in there\\". The bomb failed to cause a blackout. Police surrounded the area where the bomb exploded. Agents from the General Department of Special Investigations (DGIE) and the Political and Social Police (DPPS), as well as officers from the 16th and 32nd precincts, inspected the location. Forensic expects of the DGIE and DPPS concluded that the explosion was \\"very violent\\" and that the damage could have been worse had the car not been distant from other vehicles in the parking lot. Even still, a nearby Chevette had its windshield destroyed. The experts claimed that the bomb at the power station was conducted by a different group that had not been yet identified. Breaking news reports on the explosions on radio and television prompted relatives of concert attendees to drive to Riocentro in search of more information, leading to increased traffic and causing a commotion in the surroundings. Reactions and government response At the concert, Gonzaguinha communicated the happenings of that evening to the audience. In a speech he said \\"these two bombs represent exactly a fight to destroy that which we all want, a democracy, freedom\\". He further urged the audience to \\"remember this very well\\" because next's year May Day celebration \\"depend[ed] on [them]\\".Ferron p. 150 Approached after the show ended, Chico Buarque said that if true, the bombing was \\"nameless cowardice\\" and a \\"terrorist attack against the First of May show, against the First of May, [...] and against the Brazilian people, I think, regardless of the music being played\\".Ferron p. 151 On 2 May the Commander of the First Army Division, General Gentil Marcondes Filho, declared that the men were in an \\"information mission, in service of the First Army [Division]\\". When asked if Machado was the victim or author of the explosions, Marcondes Filho answered that he was \\"obviously\\" a victim, \\"unless proven otherwise\\". Marcondes Filho had attended the funeral of Ros√°rio, who was buried with military honors, at the Cemetery of Iraj√°, and later arrived at Hospital Miguel Couto to visit Captain Machado. In an interview at the hospital he said \\"whatever is investigated will be [publicly] disclosed\\". That day, colleagues of Machado and the widow of Ros√°rio revealed to the press that both men worked for the DOI-CODI. Political reactions to the events were swift. On 2 May Minister of Justice Ibrahim Abi-Ackel said the bomb \\"exploded inside the government\\" in a statement repudiating the explosions. Abi-Ackel guaranteed, however, that the incident would not affect the abertura process. In a statement, Minas Gerais Senator Tancredo Neves described the incident as the \\"last rattle of the reaction defeated in the polls and sweeped from [its] ranks\\". PMDB secretary-general and Rio Grande do Sul Senator Pedro Simon expressed his fears that the terrorist violence would go unpunished and bemoaned the \\"incompetence of the government\\" in investigating it. Congressional leaders denounced the act as terrorism and expressed concern that hardliners wanted to sabotage the abertura.Skidmore p. 228 A Planato source spoke of the news of the explosion as a surprise to the administration. On 1 May the First Army Division launched a military police inquiry (IPM) to investigate the incidents at Riocentro. On 3 May the Federal Police also opened an investigation, according to the press secretary of the Ministry of Justice. According to O Globo in 2018, a May 1981 U.S. intelligence document previously located in the State Dept. showed early evidence of the attack being coordinated by the military and not left-wing organizations. The document does not ascribe the attack to President Figueiredo, who did not \\"necessarily need to be involved in any way with the actions of the Army in these incidents\\". The document, kept in the National Archives in Rio, also describes the Figueiredo administration's actions to prevent a crisis by promising to publish results of the investigation and maintain the regular agenda to try and keep stories about Riocentro away from the news media. Legal action In 1999, fourteen years after the redemocratization of Brazil, an inquiry on the attack was opened by federal prosecutor Gilda Berer. It concluded that Ros√°rio and Machado were responsible for the crime, in addition to former National Intelligence directors Newton Cruz and Freddie Perdig√£o. The Superior Military Court moved to shelve the case under Brazilian amnesty law. In April 2014 the National Truth Commission (CNV), established by the federal government in 2011 to investigate human rights violations from 1946 to 1988, released their report on the Riocentro case. CNV concluded that military authorities were not only aware of the attack beforehand, but were also behind decisions to reduce policing that night, lock emergency exits at Riocentro and cover up the subsequent controversy. The report further stated that the attack aimed at \\"obstruct[ing] the political abertura process\\" and was planned to be the \\"largest terrorist attack in the history of Brazil\\", but its failed execution reframed it as an \\"episode that reveals the violence of the dictatorial State against Brazilian society\\". In 2014 five military men and a police chief were charged with first-degree murder and criminal conspiracy for their involvement in the operation, after renewed investigations by Federal Public Prosecution. In September 2019 the Superior Court of Justice of Brazil ruled in favor of archiving the criminal suit against the six men, citing that it was not possible to characterize the attack as a crime against humanity and that the suit was in violation of Article 5 of the Constitution, which prohibits ex post facto enforcement of the law.

It was translated into German by Wilhelm S√ºss as Konvexe Polyeder in 1958. An updated edition, translated into English by Nurlan S. Dairbekov, Sem√´n Samsonovich Kutateladze and Alexei B. Sossinsky, with added material by Victor Zalgaller, L. A. Shor, and Yu. A. Volkov, was published as Convex Polyhedra by Springer- Verlag in 2005. Topics The main focus of the book is on the specification of geometric data that will determine uniquely the shape of a three- dimensional convex polyhedron, up to some class of geometric transformations such as congruence or similarity. It considers both bounded polyhedra (convex hulls of finite sets of points) and unbounded polyhedra (intersections of finitely many half-spaces). The 1950 Russian edition of the book included 11 chapters. The first chapter covers the basic topological properties of polyhedra, including their topological equivalence to spheres (in the bounded case) and Euler's polyhedral formula. After a lemma of Augustin Cauchy on the impossibility of labeling the edges of a polyhedron by positive and negative signs so that each vertex has at least four sign changes, the remainder of chapter 2 outlines the content of the remaining book. Chapters 3 and 4 prove Alexandrov's uniqueness theorem, characterizing the surface geometry of polyhedra as being exactly the metric spaces that are topologically spherical locally like the Euclidean plane except at a finite set of points of positive angular defect, obeying Descartes' theorem on total angular defect that the total angular defect should be 4\\\\pi. Chapter 5 considers the metric spaces defined in the same way that are topologically a disk rather than a sphere, and studies the flexible polyhedral surfaces that result. Chapters 6 through 8 of the book are related to a theorem of Hermann Minkowski that a convex polyhedron is uniquely determined by the areas and directions of its faces, with a new proof based on invariance of domain. A generalization of this theorem implies that the same is true for the perimeters and directions of the faces. Chapter 9 concerns the reconstruction of three-dimensional polyhedra from a two-dimensional perspective view, by constraining the vertices of the polyhedron to lie on rays through the point of view. The original Russian edition of the book concludes with two chapters, 10 and 11, related to Cauchy's theorem that polyhedra with flat faces form rigid structures, and describing the differences between the rigidity and infinitesimal rigidity of polyhedra, as developed analogously to Cauchy's rigidity theorem by Max Dehn. The 2005 English edition adds comments and bibliographic information regarding many problems that were posed as open in the 1950 edition but subsequently solved. It also includes in a chapter of supplementary material the translations of three related articles by Volkov and Shor, including a simplified proof of Pogorelov's theorems generalizing Alexandrov's uniqueness theorem to non-polyhedral convex surfaces. Audience and reception Robert Connelly writes that, for a work describing significant developments in the theory of convex polyhedra that was however hard to access in the west, the English translation of Convex Polyhedra was long overdue. He calls the material on Alexandrov's uniqueness theorem \\"the star result in the book\\", and he writes that the book \\"had a great influence on countless Russian mathematicians\\". Nevertheless, he complains about the book's small number of exercises, and about an inconsistent level presentation that fails to distinguish important and basic results from specialized technicalities. Although intended for a broad mathematical audience, Convex Polyhedra assumes a significant level of background knowledge in material including topology, differential geometry, and linear algebra. Reviewer Vasyl Gorkaviy recommends Convex Polyhedra to students and professional mathematicians as an introduction to the mathematics of convex polyhedra. He also writes that, over 50 years after its original publication, \\"it still remains of great interest for specialists\\", after being updated to include many new developments and to list new open problems in the area.

Rule= First reign  Andrea II Muzaka came from the noble family of Muzaka, who were wealthy in central Albania.

At the beginning of his rule he exercised nominal rule over much of the country of Adriatic sea between Vjosa and Devoll rivers eastwards but in practice this continued to be dominated by the historic Albanian noble families who paid little heed to Muzaka's authority.https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Constantinian_Order_of_Saint_George/GBjRDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv;=1&dq;=andrea+II+muzaka+despot&pg;=PA501&printsec;=frontcover Andrea held alliance both diplomatic and friendship with the Angevins, other noble members of family were always allowed to go to Durr√´s which at that time was held by the Anjou-durrazo family. According to the medieval Albanian historian Gjon Muzaka, Andrea would defeat the King Vukasin in a great battle, therefor in his honor it would be given the second highest tittle below to Emperor, that of Despot by the Emperor of the Byzantine Empire, which he had been a great threat to him and his nominal substantially weakening Empire, as well as the coat of arms of the Muzaka family would be replaced with the new double-headed eagle flag As soon as Andrea II Muzaka had obtained the title of despot, he endorsed an anti-Byzantine revolt (1335-1341) in his domains, and also formed an alliance with the Anjou from Naples on 30 December 1336, whereas he was recognized as a vassal of Robert, Prince of Taranto. As proof of his fidelity to the Capetian House of Anjou, Andrea II Muzaka had to leave one of his sons as hostage in Durazzo.  Resistance against the Serbians  During the period 1341-1347 the Byzantine Empire was going through a deep civil war which lead the Serbians take it as an advantage and start an invasion all over into the southern Balkans. The despot Andrea held great resistance and formed various alliances with other Albanian noble families and with the Anjou as well. In 1336, the short-lived Serbian Empire under Stefan Du≈°an captured Angevin-controlled Durazzo. Although Angevins managed to recapture Durazzo, Du≈°an continued his expansion, and in the period of 1337‚Äî45 he had captured Kanina and Valona (in modern-day southern Albania). Andrea Muzaka waged against the Serbian forces around 1340 when forces of Andrea defeated the Serbian army at the Pelister mountain. Andrea Muzaka with an alliance with the Gropa family would have several other successful campaigns against Dusan, however although in a short period of time his domains like with the other Albanian principalities would eventually be invaded by the Serbian King.  Second reign  After the death of Stefan Du≈°an in 1355 and collapse of the short-lived Serbian Empire, the despot Andrea regained control over parts of the south-eastern modern-day Albania and significantly expanded the principality over northern Greece with Kastoria after the Battle of Marica in 1371 which Andrea II Muzaka had captured from Prince Marko.

Remaining in the military, he took part in the First World War, serving from 1914 and was released into civilian life as a leutnant in October 1919. When discharged, he worked in the Ansbach pension office as senior secretary, was promoted to administrative inspector there in 1927 and worked as a propagandist and organizer for the Deutschv√∂lkischer Schutz- und Trutzbund in Middle Franconia. In 1920 Grimm joined the anti-Semitic German Socialist Party, of which Julius Streicher was a member. This party merged with the Nazis in 1922 and Grimm received membership number 10,134. Nazi career When the Nazi Party was re-established after being outlawed in the aftermath of the Beer Hall Putsch, Grimm rejoined on 27 February 1925. He became Ortsgruppenleiter (Local Group Leader) in Ansbach and in 1926 Kreisleiter (County Leader). In May 1928 he was elected to the Bavarian Landtag. From 1 October 1928 to 1 March 1929 he was Gauleiter for Middle Franconia-West. However, when his Gau was merged with Streicher‚Äôs neighboring Gau (Nuremberg- F√ºrth) he became Deputy Gauleiter for Middle Franconia under Streicher. In February 1932, Grimm was made an Associate Judge of USCHLA, the Nazi Party's investigative and mediation committee, a body that regulated internal party disputes. In January 1934 its name was changed to Oberstes Parteigericht (Supreme Party Court) though it was more of an arbitration and mediation organization, rather than a strictly legal one. From 1 June 1932 Grimm was Chairman of the Second Chamber of USCHLA. In March 1933, he was elected to the Reichstag for electoral constituency 26, Franconia. On 3 June 1933 he was appointed Reichsleiter, the second highest rank in the Nazi Party. Grimm joined the Schutzstaffel (SS) (membership no. 199,823) on 18 October 1933 with the rank of SS-Oberf√ºhrer. He was promoted to SS-Brigadef√ºhrer on 24 December and on 27 January 1934 he was promoted to SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer. He served on the staff of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler from April 1936.

In August 1941, he served briefly in the German army on the Eastern Front as a battalion commander with the rank of hauptmann before returning to Germany in 1943 due to illness. He resumed duties in Himmler's office, working on issues related to the war economy. Grimm died in a car accident on 21 July 1944.

The seas pushed Armada into range of French batteries at Borgidhero; the batteries opened fire but the shots went over Armada. Armada landed her marines who captured the eastern battery and then entered the battery on the point of Borgidhero after the French had tried to blow it up. The marines spiked the guns. The landing party took fire from the nearby town so the frigates accompanying Armada fired on the town while the landing party burnt some vessels on the shore. In August‚ÄìSeptember, Holly was part of a squadron of some 17 vessels that participated in the siege of San Sebasti√°n. Because of the shallowness of the water, only the smaller vessels could approach closely enough to bring their guns to bear on the town's defenses. In 1847 the Admiralty awarded the clasp \\"St. Sebastian\\" to the Naval General Service Medal to all surviving naval participants at the siege. Fate Holly was sailing along the coast of northern Spain on 28 January 1814when the weather deteriorated to the point that Treacher decided to shelter at San Sebasti√°n. During the night the gale parted her anchor cable and drove her onto the rocks under Mount Aguillo. She started to break up almost immediately. Her mainmast fell over onto the rocks and most of the crew were able to use it to escape the wreck. Even so, Lieutenant Treacher and three other men drowned.

Szymanski was promoted to a tenured associate professor in UTK's Department of Psychology in 2010 and earned their Angie Warren Perkins Award. She was also elected a fellow of the APA's Division 44, the Society for the Psychological Study of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Issues. Following her promotion, Szymanski received the APA's Outstanding Major Contribution Award in the Counseling Psychologist for Sexual Objectification of Women for 2012 and was elected the APA's Woman of the Year. At the beginning of 2015, Szymanski began to focus on Breastaurants, sexually objectifying environments, and their long-term impact on women's mental and physical health. She co-wrote an article on The Conversation which detailed the link between negative aspects of waitressing at breastaurants and negative emotions such as anxiety, anger, sadness, depressed mood, confusion, and degradation. This led to the publication of a study in 2017 titled Sexually Objectifying Environments: Power, Rumination, and Waitresses‚Äô Anxiety and Disordered Eating. Along with co-author Renee Mikorski, Szymanski found that women who work in breastaurants are at higher risk for anxiety and eating disorders. As a result of her \\"outstanding contributions in advancing lesbian, bisexual, and transgender women's psychology through research, teaching, practice, and/or activism,\\" she received the APA's 2017 Laura Brown Award. In 2019, Szymanski was appointed the Editor-In-Chief of the Society for the Psychology of Women's (Division 35 of the American Psychological Association) journal, Psychology of Women Quarterly.

She is the first ethnic Assyrian to be elected to the Lincolnwood Board of Trustees and the first Assyrian woman elected to a political office in Illinois. Early life and education Sargon is a first generation Assyrian American. She grew up in Chicago before moving to Lincolnwood with her family at the age of 15. She first attended Theodore Roosevelt High School in Chicago, then transferred to Niles West High School. She earned a B.A. in political science at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. After graduating college, she worked as a legal assistant for a law firm in Chicago. She eventually married and had two children. She also went back to school, earning a M.A in public policy and administration at Northwestern University. Afterwards, she became the first vice president of Lincolnwood School District 74 Parent Teachers Association. Career=Election Sargon's early interest in political activism first came from her parents, who she said volunteered to the local Assyrian community despite also working many hours. She has also cited her grandmother as an early source of inspiration. She briefly put her political ambitions aside due to her job, motherhood, and first vice presidency of the Lincolnwood PTA. In 2017, she was mentored by Illinois Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), who encouraged her to return to politics. She later stated that, despite her political educational background, she had not considered running for office until she met Schakowsky and heard the story of how Schakowsky had entered politics due to her concerns about unsafe practices in the food industry. She was also encouraged to enter politics by Illinois State Senator Ram Villivalam, whose successful campaign she'd previously volunteered with. Schakowsky also encouraged Sargon to attend training at the Illinois Women's Institute for Leadership Training Academy, a program that encourages women to pursue political positions. She completed training with the program in 2019. In 2019, she ran for a position on Lincolnwood's six-member Board of Trustees on the Alliance for Lincolnwood ticket. The other candidates on the ticket were Craig Klatzco and Jesal Patel. She and the other Alliance for Lincolnwood candidates were endorsed by the American Middle East Voters Alliance. On April 2, 2019, she was elected to the Board. Upon being sworn in on May 7 of that year, she became the first Assyrian to hold the position, and the first Assyrian woman elected to a political office in Illinois. She won the election with 1,435 votes. This was seen as a large amount by Lincolnwood standards. The incumbent mayor at the time had received 1,167 votes, and her fellow Alliance for Lincolnwood candidates received 1,329 and 1,328 votes respectively. Their three opponents on the Lifelong for Lincolnwood ticket received 849 votes, 847 votes, and 843 votes respectively. She credited the political engagement of the Assyrian community as a reason for her landslide win. Many canvassing and outreach efforts for her campaign were organized by Vote Assyrian, an organization that aims to increase political engagement among Assyrian Americans. As trustee Aside from her prior support of issues pertaining to ethnic Assyrians, Sargon has taken up several other positions upon the start of her political career. =Campaign= During a public address for her trustee election campaign, Sargon condemned alleged threatening comments made by a preceeding Lincolnwood trustee towards a female colleague. She said that it was a common behavior from their local government that needed to be removed through leading by example. At the same address, she also expressed support for programs that increase diversity advocacy. Sargon was also the subject of personal attacks on social media during the election by one of her Lifelong for Lincolnwood opponents and incumbent Mayor Barry Bass. Bass compared her to Assyrian American Representative Anna Eshoo (incorrectly referring to her as \\"Pamela Isho\\"), alleging she had \\"forgotten her cause\\" in relation to her Assyrian identity after being elected, implying that Sargon would do the same if elected. =Worker protection= Sargon and others on the board proposed a meeting to discuss raising the minimum wage and changing sick time rules for workers in Lincolnwood in September 2019. The meeting was eventually was approved and presented to the rest of the board for a vote in January 2020. She voted in favor of adopting Cook County's sick leave requirements in Lincolnwood. She and two others also voted in favor of raising Lincolnwood's minimum wage beyond the wage set by Cook County. She was quoted as saying: =Supreme Court of Illinois endorsement= Sargon formally endorsed candidate Daniel Epstein during the 2020 Illinois judicial elections for the Supreme Court of Illinois =Council‚Äìmanager government= Sargon has expressed support for the idea of having a workshop in order to explore the possibility of converting Lincolnwood into a council‚Äìmanager government, both during her campaign and after being elected. =COVID-19 response= In March 2020, Sargon and several other board members met to discuss the potential implementation of new rules regarding face masks and coverings amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. She supported the new measures, saying: =Other positions= In June 2019, Sargon voted in favor of a proposal to restripe an area next to a business owned by her fellow trustee and Alliance for Lincolnwood member, Craig Klatzko. The measure itself was controversial due to the potential \\"negative message\\" of restriping an area close to a business owned by a village official. Mayor Barry Bass ended up casting the tie-breaking vote against the measure. Sargon and three other trustees voted against the construction of a video game caf√© in Lincolnwood, citing public discontent, personal concerns about video game addiction, and the close proximity of the proposed caf√© to religious institutions. Assyrian activism Sargon has been involved with Assyrian activism before, during, and after the start of her political career. Early activism As a student at the University of Illinois, she became a founding member of the Assyrian Chaldean Syriac Student Movement. Civic engagement in the Assyrian community Aside from being the first Assyrian woman elected in Illinois, Sargon is a member of the executive board of Vote Assyrian and the advisory board of the American Middle East Voters Alliance PAC. Sargon joined Senator Ram Villivalam as a guest during the Illinois Senate's 101st General Assembly session in April 2019. Senator Villivalam discussed her accomplishments as an Assyrian female activist. He also said that they \\"had been discussing the next steps in her public service career\\" and that \\"she [Sargon] has committed to not running for State Senate, and I [Villivalam] am very appreciative of that.\\" In September 2019, Sargon, along with Senator Ram Villivalam and representatives from Vote Assyrian, addressed the public about the importance of civic engagement among the Assyrian American Community. In July 2020, Sargon joined Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, former Second Lady of the United States Jill Biden, and New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham to represent the Assyrian American community as a co- chair of the 19th Annual Ultimate Women's Power Lunch. Vote Assyrian census project Sargon is a proponent of Vote Assyrian's 2020 census project. The project encourages Assyrian Americans to fill out the 2020 census to get an accurate population count of Assyrians residing in the United States. In an discussion with Borderless Magazine, she stressed the importance of the project, saying: Drug addiction and mental health advocacy In September 2020, Sargon was the moderator of a panel discussion among several Assyrian medical experts hosted by the Assyrian Student Association of Chicago. The discussion focused on drug abuse and mental health. It particularly focused on the stigma that surrounds them, as well as resources that can be utilized, and fostering public education of the issue. Public addresses In May 2020, Sargon was a guest speaker at the Assyrian Student Association of Chicago's class of 2020 virtual graduation ceremony. She specifically addressed the experiences that many Assyrian students endure in the United States. She also discussed the effort that comes with building a reputation in a community, the impact of social media, and the necessity of each person to be a consistent advocate for their causes of interest. Her final message was a word of encouragement for younger Assyrians to be more civically engaged and to find methods of contributing to their community in ways that interest them.

Early life and education  Ellis grew up in Plano, Texas. He is the oldest of three children. Ellis started college at the University of Southern California, where he planned to graduate and be a screenwriter, and study as part of USC‚Äôs Thematic Option program. However, during his freshman orientation he switched his major to aerospace engineering. Ellis and Relativity's other co-founder and CTO, Jordan Noone, both held leadership positions at USC's Rocket Propulsion Lab. With the Rocket Propulsion Lab, Ellis and Noone helped launch the first student-designed and built rocket into space. While at the University of Southern California, Ellis had three consecutive internships with Blue Origin. Ellis holds a BS and a MS in Aerospace Engineering from USC Viterbi School of Engineering.  Career = Blue Origin  After graduation, Ellis joined Blue Origin full time where he worked on 3D printed rocket components and served as a propulsion development engineer on crew capsule RCS thrusters, BE-4, and New Glenn. At Blue Origin, Ellis was credited for bringing metal 3D-printing in-house.  Relativity Space  In 2015, Ellis co-founded Relativity Space with his former classmate, Jordan Noone, with the mission of being the first company to launch a fully 3D printed rocket into orbit. Ellis and Noone received their initial $500,000 in funding from cold emailing Mark Cuban. In April 2018, Cuban told the Los Angeles Times over email that he invested in Relativity because, \\"They are smart, innovative, focused and always learning.\\" Ellis and Noone were also part of Y Combinator in their 2016 cohort.

Elliott (1828-1897) was an American surveyor, cartographer, and railroad promoter. He is credited with creating two important maps surveying the locations of remains on the Gettysburg and Antietam battlefields. Life and career Simon Green Elliott was born in Pittsfield, New Hampshire on March 27, 1828. He was inspired by the Gold Rush to move to California in 1855. He began a career as a surveyor by 1856. Several years later, he successfully completed a survey of a proposed rail route between Nevada and Northern California for the Sacramento, Placer and Nevada Railroad Company, moving him toward the railroad industry. Perhaps related to this project, he produced at least one map of California, a view of \\"Central California: showing the different railroad lines completed & projected\\" published in 1860. In 1863, he was appointed as the chief engineer of the California and Oregon Railroad Company. He was tasked with surveying a route for a track planned between Marysville, California and Portland, Oregon. After several months, however, he and his colleagues had run out of both time and funds. They quarrelled, and Elliott left the team to return south. He decided to travel east to present a claim to Congress and seek land grants and other aid for the project. He departed in late fall of 1863, and arrived in New York City on 18 January 1864. Elliott met with government officials in Washington, D.C. on multiple occasions throughout February 1864. Ultimately, however, he was unsuccessful: the railroad bill before Congress that would have provided funds for Elliott and his colleagues did not pass. During his time in Washington, he created his maps surveying the Antietam and Gettysburg battlefields. Elliott remained on the East Coast through the following spring, when he married Cornelia Blanchard on March 7, 1865, in her hometown of Weymouth, Massachusetts. The following month, he returned to California, arriving in San Francisco on April 2, 1865. He seems to have travelled back and forth between California and Masschusetts for the next decade, and together he and Cornelia had four children. He appears to have been undeterred by his failure to complete his survey of the planned California-Oregon rail line. Several years later, he embarked on a similar venture under the name of the Oregon Central Railroad Company of Salem; this attempted partnership crumbled under Elliott's financial mismanagement and possible fraud, and was taken over by Ben Holladay, who turned it into the Oregon and California Railroad Company. By the mid-1870s, Elliott appears to have retired permanently to Massachusetts, where he died of heart disease on September 19, 1897. Battlefield maps Elliott is remembered for his detailed maps of two Civil War battlefields. While in Washington in the spring of 1864, pursuing his case to Congress, he produced at least two detailed surveys of the Gettysburg and Antietam battlefields. While the full story of how he became involved in this project is unknown, it is likely that he was given access to original surveys of temporary burial sites undertaken by officials at the times of the battles (Gettysburg in July 1863, and Antietam in September 1862). His maps reflect and appear to draw heavily on the eyewitness work done by local officials and community members (such as David Wills of Gettysburg, who had commissioned a survey of burial locations within two weeks of the battle). The Gettysburg map, published in 1864 by \\"S.G. Elliott,\\" shows the location of 8,352 individual burial locations and 345 dead horses. However, it only identifies seventeen of the graves by name. The Antietam map shows 5,800 graves, including the names of 45 deceased soldiers (although it does include some minor errors). The increased detail for the latter map may be a result of the fact that, although the Battle of Antietam took place a year before Gettysburg, its dead were not interred in a permanent cemetery until 1864, after the publication of Elliott's map. The maps were published by H.H. Lloyd, a New York publisher and bookseller, sometime in June 1864, and are known to have been sold at the 1864 Sanitary Fair in Philadelphia, as well as by H.H. Lloyd at their premises in New York. Few copies of the maps are known to survive today, but they have both been digitized (the Antietam map by the New York Public Library and the Gettysburg map by the Library of Congress). The American Battlefield Trust uses Elliott's map of Gettysburg to inform its conservation activities in the Gettysburg area.

She was present at the 1978 conference of Commonwealth non-governmental organisations in Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia, that led to the foundation of the Commonwealth Journalists' Association, and would remain, in the words of Lord Black of Brentwood, chairman of the CPU Media Trust, \\"throughout her lifetime and her distinguished career, a doughty champion of press freedom\\". She served as the Secretariat's Director of Information and the Official Spokesperson for The Commonwealth at international conventions, including Commonwealth Heads of Government meetings, from 1983 to 1994. As described by Victoria Brittain in The Guardian, Robertson was \\"a prominent figure in the historic turning of the tide against Margaret Thatcher's support for apartheid South Africa by the Commonwealth leadership, headed by Sir Shridath (Sonny) Ramphal.\\" According to The Times: \\"Sir Shridath 'Sonny' Ramphal, the Commonwealth's second secretary-general, was the public face of that organisation's long battle against apartheid in South Africa and Britain‚Äôs refusal to join it. Scarcely less important, however, was Patsy Robertson, the Jamaican official behind Sir Sonny, who for nearly three decades used her role as the Commonwealth's spokeswoman to foment international opposition to South Africa's pernicious regime, and to challenge Britain's assertion that it could be reformed, not destroyed.\\" As characterised by Marina Salandy-Brown, \\"It was a war of attrition, led by Patsy behind the scenes, in which we journalists all had a small part to play.\\" After Robertson left the Commonwealth Secretariat in 1994, she joined the United Nations (UN) in the role of senior media adviser to the Secretary-General of the Fourth World Conference on Women held in Beijing, China, in 1995, returning to the UN to fill the same role for the Beijing +5 conference in New York in 2000, and for the General Assembly Special Session on Children in 2001 and 2002. In 2007 she was appointed chair of the Ramphal Institute ‚Äì which was founded as the Ramphal Centre for Commonwealth Policy Studies and formally launched at Marlborough House in 2008 at a celebration to mark the 80th birthday of Sir Shridath Ramphal, Commonwealth Secretary-General from 1975 to 1990 ‚Äì a post she would hold until the time of her death. She was also Chair of Widows Rights International and the Commonwealth Association, and a trustee of several charities including the Thomson Foundation, the Commonwealth Press Union and the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum and, additionally, she was a founder member and President of the Friends of the Georgian Society of Jamaica, a small charity founded in 1994 by her friend Pamela Beshoff, dedicated to \\"the noble task of preserving Jamaica's history and heritage\\" by conserving and promoting awareness of the island's historic structures. In 2015 the Policy Institute at King's College London announced her appointment as a Visiting Professor. Honours and recognition that she received include a Nexus Commonwealth Award in 2013 for her Outstanding Contribution, \\"presented to an individual who has demonstrated long and tireless service to one or more Commonwealth institutions\\". According to former Commonwealth Secretary-General Chief Emeka Anyaoku, Patsy Robertson was \\"a true symbol of the modern Commonwealth who served the organization with passion and unflinching dedication\\", who worked \\"with singular fervor to support its structures, and who never minced words in criticizing actions or pronouncements by governments that she perceived as undermining the principles and values that animate the modern Commonwealth.\\" Personal life She was married to Calum Robertson, who predeceased her. She had three children: John, Sarah and Neil.

It is only known from isolated teeth, but has been found in Europe, Africa, and Asia. It is assumed to be pelagic, occurring more frequently in deeper water deposits, most notably the London Clay and Eocene deposits in Denmark. It is distinguished by its rectangular root and twisted blade, unique among Mackerel shark. It is unclear what this niche this specialized dentition helped exploit. Taxonomy and Affinities The following species have been attributed to Xiphodolamia: *X. ensis *X. serrata *X. eocaena(?) *X. barbadica(?) X. barbadica was described from the Lutetian- aged Scotland Formation of the West Indes, and X eocaena was treated as the Ypresian-aged North American and European representative. X ensis was originally described out of the early-middle Eocene of Central Asia and Jordan. However, X. barbadica and X. eocaeana are not easily discernable from the type species X. ensis, and most recent authors have treated them as junior synonyms. X. serrata is a serrated variety known from the Upper Eocene of Africa and Arabia. It appears to be the culmination of a singular evolving lineage, and thus Xiphodolamia is an example of anagensis. The development of serrations in Xiphodolamia mirrors that of Otodus in the Ypresian, and thus is an example of convergent evolution. This genus is not known to have survived into the Oligocene. Though in the past the genus has been placed in many orders, it is now the consensus Xiphodolamia is an unusual member of the order Lamniformes. However, its placement within Lamniformes is uncertain, especially its relationship to lamnidae and Isurus. Some have placed it in its own family, Xiphidolamnidae. It is unlikely this matter will be resolved until associated material or transitional fossils are found and described. Paleobiogeography Xiphodolamia is widely but thinly spread. The following places have produced Xiphodolamia teeth: North America *Maryland (Nanjemoy Formation) *South Carolina (Santee Limestone) *Barbados (Scotland Beds) *New Jersey Europe *England (London Clay) *Belgium (Tielt Formation) *The Netherlands (Dongen Formation) *Italy *Romania *Slovakia Asia *Kazakhstan (Tologaysor Formation) *Jordan *Iran Africa *Angola *Togo References Category:Lamniformes Category:Fossils of Angola Category:Prehistoric shark genera Category:Eocene ","title":"Xiphodolamia"},{"id":"65003257","text":"Wies≈Çaw Wraga (born 14 August 1963 in Poland) is a Polish retired footballer.Wies≈Çaw Wraga do pi≈Çkarzy Widzewa: \\"Przyszed≈Ç czas, by pokazaƒá jaja\\" lodz.sport.plWies≈Çaw Wraga: S≈Çyszeli≈õmy, ≈ºe przyniesiemy wstyd, a przywie≈∫li≈õmy brƒÖzowe medale laczynaspilka.pl References Category:Living people Category:1963 births Category:Polish footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Association football forwards Category:Widzew ≈Å√≥d≈∫ players Category:Oulun Palloseura players ","title":"Wies≈Çaw Wraga"},{"id":"65003279","title":"List of ambassadors of Iran to Germany"},{"id":"65003281","text":"Shuikou may refer to: *Shuikou, Meizhou, a town in Xingning City, Meizhou, Guangdong Province, China *Shuikou, Yanling, a town in Yanling County, Huzhou, Hunan Province, China *Shuikou, Gutian, a town in Gutian County, Ningde, Fujian Province, China *Shuikou, Dehua, a town in Dehua County, Quanzhou, Fujian Province, China *Shuikou, Kaiping, a town in Kaiping City, Jiangmen, Guangdong Province, China *Shuikou, Longzhou, a town in Longzhou County, Chongzuo, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China *Shuikou, Liping, a town in Liping County, Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Guizhou, China *Shuikou, Suining, a town in Suining County, Shaoyang, Hunan Province, China *Shuikou, Binzhou, a town in Binzhou City, Xianyang, Shaanxi Province, China *Shuikou, Changxing, a township in Changxing County, Huzhou, Zhejiang Province, China See also *Shuikou Dam, Fujian Province, China ","title":"Shuikou"},{"id":"65003291","text":"Reuben Fenton (1819‚Äì1885) was a U.S. Senator from New York from 1969 to 1975.

The Zamindari abolition and communist upsurge in Bihar gave rise to a tug of war between upper and the lower caste. But, the tussle between the Marxist and the proprietors was not divided on caste lines, as some of the middle peasant castes were also proprietors. The decade of 1960 witnessed communist upsurge, which initiated in the Bhojpur region led by Jagdish Mahto under the banner of Communist Party of India.While the 1990s saw dreaded caste wars. The contenders were Dalits and poor peasantry of middle peasant castes, who were fighting for their rights with the supporters of status-quoism i.e. upper castes as well as affluent section of the middle peasant castes viz Yadav, Kurmi and Koeri. Its first mass leader was Jagdish Mahto, a koeri teacher who had read ambedkar before he discovered marx and started a paper in the town of arrah called Harijanistan(\\"dalit land\\"). Religious sentiments also becomes the cause of bitter strife many a times. The violence that happened in Bhagalpur is an example. Laxmanpur Bathe massacre, 1996 Laxmanpur Bathe massacre was a sanguinary act of the Ranvir Sena, a militia dominated by Bhumihar caste. In the village called Laxmanpur Bathe, nearly 56 Dalits including women and the children were killed. The trial which followed the massacre revealed the implicit involvement of some of the major political parties and the leaders of the Bihar. It was also claimed that the Police force which was deployed there to protect the villagers assisted the Sena members to launch the assault on the Dalits. Dalelchak-Bhagaura massacre 1987 In the Dalelchak-bhagora village of Aurangabad district of Bihar, the dispute over hundreds of acre of land between Yadav and Rajput community was the principal cause of the carnage in which over 50 Rajput were killed by Maoist Communist Centre, which was dominated by Yadavs.The massacre also resulted in the exodus of 40 Rajput families and from the village. Chief Minister Bindeshwari Dubey announced the relief to the victim families in the form of government jobs. Later some of the convicts were given death sentence by the court, while majority of them remained out of reach. Shankarbigha massacre 1999 The infamous massacre led to assassination of 23 Dalit people including men and women of the Shankarbigha village. The prime accused of the carnage were the members of Ranvir Sena, a militia of Bhumihar landlords, while the sufferers were Dalits. In 1999 most of the accused were acquitted by a court based in Jahanabad. Bara massacre 1992 In the \\"Bara massacre\\" the 37 members of Bhumihar caste were slain by the Maoist Communist Centre.According to the report of India Today, Yadav leaders of Janata Dal were accused of provoking the violence against the Bhumihars after killing of 10 Dalits in Barsimha village by \\"Savarana Liberation Front\\", an upper caste organisation. A court later tried the perpetrators. The upper caste retaliated by killing 56 Dalits at Laxmanpur Bathe. Bathani Tola massacre 1996 In \\"Bathani Tola\\", a village located in Bhojpur region of Bihar. The members of Ranvir Sena including people of Bhumihar and Rajput caste killed 21 Dalits. The victims included women, children and infant also. A session court of Ara inflicted capital punishment upon three perpetrators while other were given life imprisonment. The Patna High Court however acquitted all of them citing lack of evidence as the reason. Afsar massacre 2000 Afsar massacre was a part of long running caste wars between Bhumihars and the Kurmi-Koeri caste in Nawada and Sheikhpura region of Bihar. Two rival gangs one led by Akhilesh Singh and another one led by Ashok Mahto were active here, which were aligned on the caste lines and drew support from their respective castes. The war claimed 200 lives in all. In this particular incident 12 relatives of Akhilesh Singh, whose wife was an MLA from the region were murdered by the Ashok Mahto gang. The Mahto gang was also responsible for assassination of Rajo Singh, a member of parliament. Belchhi massacre 1977 In 1970s, the Belchhi village in Bihar witnessed one of the severest massacre of Bihar's history. The root cause of the massacre was caste conflict between Paswan landless peasants and Kurmi landlords. This massacre parted the way between Kurmis and Paswans and made them sceptical of each other's activities in all spheres of life. Mahavir Mahto, the leader of Bhumi Sena was the main accused of the carnage in which Dusadh people were the victim. Senari massacre 1999 In the Senari village(now in Arwal district of Bihar) the dreaded naxalite organisation MCC killed 34 Bhumihars. The naxalite unit was dominated particularly by Yadav and Paswans. The convicts included Bacchesh Singh, Buddhan Yadav, Butai Yadav, Satendra Das, Lallan Pasi, Dwarika Paswan, Kariban Paswan, Godai Paswan, Uma Paswan and Gopal Paswan, who were later tried by the Session court.The victims were killed using blunt objects with utmost severity. Bhojpur Killings (1971‚Äì76) Bhojpur is a historical region in Bihar most often known for its association with Ujjainiya Rajputs. The region is also known for worst form of landlordism which was the cause of popular movement called \\"Bhojpur rebellion\\" led by newly educated backward caste youths namely Jagdish Mahto, Rameswar Ahir, Ramnaresh Ram, Maharaj Mahto who took up arms against the landlord class when mobilised by communists.Between 1971 and 1976 as Santosh Singh estimated a large number of Bhumihar landlords and landlords of other \\"upper castes\\" were killed. After Mahto's death the movement faded away bringing long lasting peace in the region. Chhotan Shukla-Brij Bihari gang wars 1994 Chhotan Shukla was the brother of former MLA of Vaishali, Munna Shukla. He used to operate a gang in the region which was in tussle with the rival gang of Brij Bihari Prasad, an OBC Bania minister in the cabinet of Lalu Prasad Yadav.Prasad was also known for his muscleman image. In an attack by the Prasad gang, Chhotan was killed along with a large number of his associates. In return Prasad was also assassinated. During Chhotan's funeral procession when Gopalganj District Magistrate, G.Krishnaiah was trying to control the furious mob he was beaten up to death by the participants in the procession which are said to be provoked by Anand Mohan Singh and Munna Shukla for doing so. Bhagalpur massacre 1989 In 1989 the ghastly massacre of Muslims in Bhagalpur district of Bihar had its roots originating from the \\"Ram Mandir movement\\" at Ayodhya. The trigger to the weeks long communal riots was the incident of Rajpur village, where a procession of Hindus aimed at garnering support for the temple movement was attacked with a Patrol bomb from the local Muslim community. The provocative slogans like \\"Hindi Hindu Hindustan, Mulla bhago Pakistan\\"(India is for Hindus, Muslims should go away to Pakistan) & \\"Jab jab Hindu jaga hai, tab tab katua bhaga hai\\"(whenever the Hindu has risen, those who are circumcised have run) were shouted by the mob which culminated into the attack finally leading to a long communal strife in which over 1000 people lost their lives. The riots broke out in whole district when rumours of killings of Hindu boys spread. Some of the most affected areas were Logain and Chandheri village, where Muslims were slaughtered and were thrown in wells and buried in cauliflower field respectively. The N.N Singh Committee set up to enquire into the case blamed Chief Minister Satyendra Narayan Singh and his government for not taking required action to save the lives and property.

Description=In literature and legend In Geoffrey Keating's 17th century Foras Feasa ar √âirinn (or 'History of Ireland') in 'An Account of the Death of Connor, King of Ulster' he records the background of the tradition, and a Christianised tale relating to it. According to Keating it was the custom during the period described in the Ulster Cycle for a victorious champion to take the brains of a defeated adversary, and make a ball of them, by mixing it with lime, followed by drying in the sun - such a ball was displayed at important events. In the story told by Keating, two fools in the court of king Conchobar mac Nessa (Connor son of Ness) decided to steal such a brain ball, being from the head of Mesgegra, former king of Leinster - having stolen it the fools then began to play with it. Whilst doing so they were discovered by Cet mac M√°gach of the kingdom of Connacht, he then took the brain ball from the fools. Later the provinces of Connacht and Ulster became at war, and Cet used the ball as a sling stone, wounding Connor greviously in the head - this began the fulfillment of a prophecy that Mesgegra would be revenged on Ulster after his death - King Connor's doctors advised that extreme stress of exertion might open the ball's wound and kill him, and so he lived carefully for seven years. However one day an eclipse occurred and Connor sought his druid on its cause - he was informed that the cause was the murder of Jesus by the Jews - Connor became incensed by this news, and this caused the wound to re-open, bring about his death. Keating notes that Connor died before the death of Jesus, and gives the explanation that the druid must have prophesied Jesus's death. Archaeological evidence (left) Coralline ball, (center and right) proposed Brain balls, rightmost is heavily worn. From Conwell's Discovery of the tomb of Ollamh Fodhla, p.62 In Irish dolmens balls have been fairly common finds, often found in the structure's floor or lower level detritus, and often associated with bones - materials identified as forming the balls include marble (thought to be a slingshot); ironstone ; calcium carbonate; porphyry; and syenite - with sizes recorded were from approximately . Some of the balls found inside dolmen cairns in the region of Slieve na Calliagh in the County of Meath were claimed by E.A. Conwell to be 'brain balls' as described in historical sources and legend. Amongst stone balls discovered in the tombs in Meath Conwell also uncovered some which were initially soft, when discovered in the earth, but hardened on drying out after which it became possible to excavate them. He identified several in two tombs as being 'brain balls'. Of these several had been worn down to a smaller size, but he identified one as being better preserved. William Frederick Wakeman also found objects he ascribed to be 'brain balls' in a tomb in Old Connacht, Bray. Wakemen submitted a sample for analysis - the ball was approximately diameter, light yellowish, and friable, containing some harder material. The harder pieces were thought to be splinters of long bones and or vegetable charcoal on inspection under a microscope. The main body of the ball was made of amorphous cement, which gave an analysis of primarily calcium carbonate, plus calcium phosphate plus traces of iron. The analysis concluded that they were man made, but too soft to be used as weapons, and furthermore did not resemble 'brain balls' made from lime with varying proportions of sheeps brain and or powdered bone. Wakeman came to the conclusion that these balls were coprolites.

Life  Isabel was the third of eight children born to Thomas Fell, a judge and member of Parliament, and Margaret Askew Fell. She was born at Swarthmoor Hall near Ulverston, Lancashire, circa 1637. In 1652, George Fox visited Swarthmoor Hall for the first time. Over the course of his stay, Isabel, her mother Margaret, and many of the family became convinced members of the Quaker faith. Thomas Fell happened to be away during this first visit; he was tolerant of their new views, but did not convert himself. He died in 1658. Isabel married William Yeamans, a Quaker and merchant of Bristol, in 1664. They had four children: William, who died in infancy, Margaret and Rachel, who both died during childhood, and a second son William, the only one who lived to adulthood. The marriage of Margaret Fell and George Fox was held at the Yeamans‚Äô home in Bristol in 1669. Isabel signed their marriage certificate. After death of her husband William in 1674, Isabel moved back to Swarthmoor Hall. Sometime in the early 1680s she agreed to marry Francis Rogers, a Quaker of Cork, but he withdrew his proposal in 1684 citing concerns about Yeamans‚Äô financial situation. Isabel was married a second time in 1689 to Abraham Morrice, a Quaker and merchant of Lincoln. She maintained close relationships with family, including her sisters and her mother, throughout her life. She died in 1704.  Career  Convinced to Quakerism in 1652, by 1660 Isabel was traveling and preaching at meetings throughout England and Scotland, as well as writing to meetings in the North and in Ireland. In Bristol she furthered the work of Fox and Margaret Fell calling for women's rights in Quaker meetings, including working for the establishment of separate women's meetings for business. She was known as a gifted speaker and skilled minister. Isabel sometimes served as a representative of and support for Fox in his travels and work with other Friends. One notable trip was to the Netherlands and Germany in 1677. Isabel joined Fox, William Penn, Robert Barclay, and George Keith and his wife Elizabeth to visit Quaker communities there and to convert others. Isabel hand delivered a letter written by Fox to the Princess Elizabeth of the Palatinate, and spoke with her. Princess Elizabeth expressed admiration for how Isabel expressed herself.

Background SS Khark 5 was built by Sasebo Heavy Industries of Sasebo, Japan, and entered service in October 1975 as Chase Venture. She was long, with a beam of , and measured 384,632 DWT. She was powered by a single steam turbine engine that gave her a service speed of . She sustained damage during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War, when she was bombed three times by Iraqi warplanes. In 1986, she was named Khark 5. Incident On 19 December 1989, Khark 5 was sailing in heavy weather about north of the Canary Islands and west of Morocco when her hull ruptured, triggering an explosion. Two of the ship's fourteen oil tanks were breached, and the 35 crewmembers abandoned ship, later to be rescued by the Soviet Union cargo ship Sarny. Shortly after the explosion, Smit Tak, a Dutch marine salvage company, was engaged to recover Khark 5. The company landed a firefighting team on the tanker, which extinguished fires on board by 21 December but were unable to immediately repair the hull breach, estimated to measure by . Both Spain and Morocco denied requests to tow the vessel into calmer waters off their coasts, which Smit Tak said prolonged efforts to repair the breach in heavy seas, although repeated efforts in December to take Khark 5 under tow anyway resulted in failure when tow cables snapped. French environmental minister Brice Lalonde later said that the operation had also been delayed during this time while Smit Tak negotiated with the Iranian state-owned oil company over payment for their services. During the following weeks, the government of Morocco attempted to contain the leaking oil, but their efforts proved largely ineffective, and on 1 January 1990, Morocco made a public request for aid from Britain, France, Spain, and Portugal. When the government made its appeal, the leading edge of the oil slick was about offshore from the Moroccan coast and was about in area, and Khark 5 was adrift about from shore. During the first days of January, several hundred responders from Morocco and Europe used chemicals to break apart the slick, laid barriers to stop the spread, and pulled oil from the water. Their efforts, combined with natural dispersion of the slick by waves and evaporation in sunny weather, meant that the majority of the oil had dispersed before reaching shore. By 3 January, Smit Tak had taken Khark 5 in tow, and had brought her about off the Moroccan coast, bound southwest towards calmer seas. The company's workers finally sealed the hull breach after an estimated 70,000 tons of oil had spilled from the tanker. After being denied entry to Portuguese waters at the island of Madeira, Smit Tak continued towing Khark 5 towards the Cape Verde Islands. Aftermath In early February, the 190,000 tons of oil remaining on Khark 5 was transferred to the Iranian tanker Shirkuh, and Khark 5 was again taken under tow, this time north towards Europe for repairs. She returned to service and was renamed Koohrang in 1991, and operated under that name until she was broken up at Gadani, Pakistan, in September 2001.

When she was five years old, her family moved to a farm outside of Mexico City. Gardu√±o's father had a strong love for animals and for life in the country. He often took the children on walks and pointed out animals, beautiful flowers, and fruit. It was from him that Gardu√±o developed her appreciation of nature. At age eighteen, Gardu√±o left home to enter the San Carlos School of Fine Arts in Mexico City. For three years, she studied painting and drawing and read poetry, literature, and philosophy. She went to see films, sometimes two in one day. When the teachers went on strike. Gardu√±o was anxious to keep learning, so she signed up to study with the only teacher who was not on strike, Hungarian photographer Kati Horna (1912-2000), in Visual Arts at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. During these studies, Gardu√±o became interested in photography for the first time. In 1979, Gardu√±o quit her studies to assist the Mexican photographer Manuel √Ålvarez Bravo with printing his portfolios in the darkroom for two years.

Gardu√±o has received photography grants from the Swiss government and the Mexican government.

He oversaw the beautification of the grounds, planting many ornamental trees and gardens.  Early life and education  Gulley was born into a farming family in Dearborn, Michigan, on July 15, 1848. He earned his bachelor of science degree from Michigan Agricultural College (now Michigan State University) in 1868 and his master of science degree in 1873. He was one of the first graduates from one of the first agricultural colleges in the United States. Both his degrees were in horticulture. He specialized in fruit farming and ornamentals.  Career  After graduation, Gulley worked in greenhouses and nurseries in Detroit, Rochester, and South Haven for the better part of two decades. He worked as assistant horticulturist at Michigan State from 1890 to 1893 and then taught at the University of Vermont for one year. In the summer of 1894, he began his 23 years of service at the University of Connecticut as professor of horticulture. He was a skilled practical horticulturist and respected teacher, but not a scholar. Gulley served for two years as president of the Connecticut Pomological Society. He was active in promoting Connecticut's fruit growing interests and frequently lectured at gatherings of state farmers. He was an active Freemason.  Gulley Hall  First occupied in 1909, the Horticulture Hall on UConn's Storrs campus was renamed Alfred Gurdon Gulley Hall in Gulley's honor in February 1921.

This may occur through regulation of energy intake (e.g.via increased or decreased appetite) or energy expenditure (e.g. via reduced metabolism or feelings of lethargy). Set point theory explains why it is difficult for dieters to maintain weight loss over time, as calorie restriction may become less effective or more difficult to maintain as regulatory mechanisms in the body actively push the body back towards the set point weight. Set point theory differentiates between active compensation and passive compensation. In active compensation, a regulatory mechanism in the body effects energy expenditure or intake. In passive compensation, a decrease in body fat levels leads to a decrease in energy compensation even without a regulatory mechanism as there is less weight to be carried. Set point theory posits active compensation in addition to passive compensation. Set point theory can be construed as implying weight regulation in a wide or tight range around the set point, in a symmetric or in an asymmetric manner (i.e. treating weight gain and loss either the same or differently), and may apply to regulation of body fat levels specifically (in a multi-compartment model) or to overall body weight. Set point theory applies to both downward and upward adjustment of weight. This return to the pre- change weight occurs faster than would be expected if individuals simply returned to their normal caloric intake and energy expenditure even after accounting for lower energy needs after weight loss, indicating an active response by the body encouraging weight gain. While the set point applies to both deviations driven by weight loss and weight gain, the set point response driving a person to regain weight to regain the set point is stronger than the response to lose weight after gaining weight above the set point, implying that it may be easier to gain than to lose weight.  Evidence  In humans, when calories are restricted because of war, famine, or diet, lost weight is typically regained quickly, including for obese patients. In the Minnesota Starvation Experiment, after human subjects were fed a near-starvation diet for a period, losing 66% of their initial fat mass, and later allowed to eat freely, they reattained and even surpassed their original fat levels, reaching 145% of the pre-starvation fat levels. Evidence for an organism-level set point has been found experimentally in \\"normal\\" rats and in rats with dorsomedial hypothalamic lesions. In addition, in a study with obese and non- obese subjects who lost 10%-20% of their body mass from underfeeding, the energy expenditure of the subjects was found to decrease, while after gaining 10% of their body mass from overfeeding their energy expenditure was found to increase.  Mechanism  As there has not been one unique mechanism identified to be behind weight regulation, it is likely that there are multiple factors reaching a shared equilibrium that result in a stable bodyweight. Leptin is known to play a key role in appetite and thus weight regulation, and may be important in regulating the set point and regulating body weight towards the set point. Changing leptin levels ‚Äì either associated with weight gain or loss, or induced via central or peripheral administration in animal models ‚Äì directly alter feeding behaviour and energy expenditure. Individuals who, due to genetic mutation, are unable to produce functional leptin or who produce leptin but are insensitive to it are prone to develop obesity. This has been confirmed by experimental \\"knockdown\\" of leptin receptors in the lateral hypothalamus in rats, which caused the rats to consume more calories and increase in body weight compared to control rats. However, most human obesity is not linked to failure to normally process leptin.  Criticism and alternatives  While set point theory has been supported in animals and humans, it may not apply to humans eating a western diet, which may be obesogenic to an extent that it overcomes the homeostatic process set forth in set theory. Set point theory does not on its own explain why body mass index for humans, measured as a proxy for fat, tends to change with increasing age or why obesity levels in a population vary depending on socioeconomic or environmental factors (or why weight tends to change for an individual when socioeconomic status and environment change). One alternative to set point theory is settling points. With settling points, an increase (or decrease) in calories consumed leads to an increase (or decrease) or energy expended until an equilibrium is reached; this differs from the set point theory in that the increase (or decrease) in energy expenditure may be driven by an increase (or decrease) in fat or lean mass without regard to a fixed set weigh or fat level and without active regulation to offset the increased (or decreased) consumption. However, the return to normal weight after subjects have their caloric intact strictly limited happens faster than would be expected in a model without active regulation (i.e. subjects return to normal weight faster than if they simply returned to normal eating habits. Another alternative is the dual intervention point model. The dual intervention point model posits that rather than a body weight set point, there is a set range for body weight. Under this model, active compensation happens only outside of upper and lower intervention points, while for weights within the set range environmental factors would have a strong effect on body weight since there would only be passive compensation for changes in weight. Differences in propensity for obesity between individuals would then be explained as individuals prone to obesity having a wide set range that extends into higher weights. In the dual intervention model, the lower and upper limits of the range are independently set, with the lower end of the range set by evolutionary pressure due to the risk of starvation if too much weight is lost and the upper bound set by pressure due to increased risk of predation if too much weight is gained.

Yao Yizhong sent Yao Xiang to lift the siege but before going, Yizhong told his son to promise him that he would capture Ran Min for massacring the Shi clan.(Á•óËàáÈñîÁõ∏ÊîªÔºåÂºã‰ª≤ÈÅ£ÂÖ∂Â≠êË•ÑÊïëÁ•óÔºåÊàíË•ÑÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊ±ùÊâçÂçÅÂÄç‰∫éÈñîÔºåËã•‰∏çÊ¢üÊìíÔºå‰∏çÈ†àÂæ©Ë¶ãÊàë‰πü„ÄÇ„Äç) Book of Jin, Volume 116 Yao Xiang arrived in Yecheng with assistance from Shi Kun (Áü≥Áê®) and Former Yan's general Yue Wan.

As the three forces approached, Ran Min decided to face Yao Xiang outside the city, This proved to be a mistake as Yao Xiang, Shi Kun and Yue Wan attacked Ran Min from three sides while Shi Zhi came out to attack from behind. Ran Min suffered a terrible defeat but managed to escape. Yao Yizhong was angered by this and punished Yao Xiang by a hundred floggings.(Ë•ÑÊìäÈñî‰∫éÂ∏∏ÁõßÊæ§ÔºåÂ§ßÁ†¥‰πãËÄåÊ≠∏„ÄÇÂºã‰ª≤ÊÄíË•Ñ‰πã‰∏çÊìíÈñî‰πüÔºåÊùñ‰πã‰∏ÄÁôæ„ÄÇ) Book of Jin, Volume 116  Flight to the south  Shi Zhi would die the same year after his subordinate Liu Xian (ÂäâÈ°Ø) assassinated him and defect to Ran Min. Yao Yizhong submitted to the Jin dynasty and received a number of titles. Yao Xiang himself received General Who Pacifies the North and a few other positions for himself. The following year, Yao Yizhong passed away. Before his death, he advised his son to join the Jin dynasty now that the Shi clan had been destroyed. Yao Xiang succeeded his father but kept his death a secret. He attacked the counties of Fagan (Áôº‰πæ; present-day Guan County, Shandong), Yangping (ÈôΩÂπ≥; present-day Shen County, Shandong) and Yuancheng (ÂÖÉÂüé; present-day Daming county, Hebei) before stopping at Que'ao Crossing (Á¢ªÁ£ù, in present-day Chiping District, Shandong) to give out appointments. He continued his way down south encountering Former Qin forces and suffered a defeat at Matian (È∫ªÁî∞, east of present-day Luoyang, Henan). In the battle, Yao Xiang's horse died, so Yao Chang gave up his horse to him to allow him to escape but fortunately for the two reinforcements came in time. He arrived at Xingyang, where only then he started mourning ritual for his father.(ÂßöÂºã‰ª≤ÊúâÂ≠êÂõõÂçÅ‰∫å‰∫∫ÔºåÂèäÁóÖÔºåË¨ÇË´∏Â≠êÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÁü≥Ê∞èÂæÖÂêæÂéöÔºåÂêæÊú¨Ê¨≤ÁÇ∫‰πãÁõ°Âäõ„ÄÇ‰ªäÁü≥Ê∞èÂ∑≤ÊªÖÔºå‰∏≠ÂéüÁÑ°‰∏ªÔºõÊàëÊ≠ªÔºåÊ±ù‰∫üËá™Ê≠∏ÊñºÊôâÔºåÁï∂Âõ∫Âü∑Ëá£ÁØÄÔºåÁÑ°ÁÇ∫‰∏çÁæ©‰πüÔºÅ„ÄçÂºã‰ª≤ÂçíÔºåÂ≠êË•ÑÁßò‰∏çÁôºÂñ™ÔºåÂ∏•Êà∂ÂÖ≠Ëê¨ÂçóÊîªÈôΩÂπ≥„ÄÅÂÖÉÂüé„ÄÅÁôº‰πæÔºåÁ†¥‰πãÔºåÂ±ØÊñºÁ¢ªÁ£ùÊ¥•Ôºå‰ª•Â§™ÂéüÁéã‰∫ÆÁÇ∫Èï∑Âè≤ÔºåÂ§©Ê∞¥Â∞πËµ§ÁÇ∫Âè∏È¶¨ÔºåÂ§™ÂéüËñõÁìö„ÄÅÁï•ÈôΩÊ¨äÁøºÁÇ∫ÂèÉËªç„ÄÇË•ÑËàáÁß¶ÂÖµÊà∞ÔºåÊïóÔºå‰∫°‰∏âËê¨È§òÊà∂ÔºåÂçóËá≥ÊªéÈôΩÔºåÂßãÁôºÂñ™„ÄÇ) Zizhi Tongjian, Volume 99  As general of Jin = Yin Hao's northern expedition  Yao Xiang sent five of his younger brothers to the Jiankang as hostages. The court accepted them and stationed Yao Xiang at Qiao (Ë≠ô; present- day Bozhou, Anhui). The southlands were quick to be charmed by Yao Xiang's personality and respected him. Around this time, Yao Xiang visited the Jin official Xie Shang at Shouchun.

Xie Shang was defeated at Chengqiao (Ë™†Ê©ã; near Xuchang) at Ying river causing him to retreat to Huainan. Yao Xiang abandoned his baggages to escorted Xie.

Yin Hao then sent a general named Wei Jing (È≠èÊÜ¨) to surprise attack Yao Xiang but he was killed by Xiang. With his plans to kill him both failing, Yin Hao decided instead to move Yao Xiang somewhere else.

When Yin Hao heard of Yao Xiang betrayal, he quickly rushed to stop him just as Yao wanted. The results were devastating for Jin as Yao Xiang killed thousands of their forces and claimed their supplies that they had abandoned.

It was first recognised as a virus that caused transmissible gastroenteritis in pigs in 1965. It was originally named Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus in 1976. After subsequent discovery of Canine cornavirus in dogs and Feline coronaivirus in cats, the three viruses were merged into a single species in 2009.  Discovery  In the mid-1940s there was an outbreak of pig disease in US, called transmissible gastroenteritis, which was characterised mainly by diarrhoea and vomiting. It was suspected to be a viral infection and was highly fatal among young pigs. Leo P. Doyle and L. M. Hutchings reported the case in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association in 1946. The virus was identified and isolated by A. W. McClurkin in 1965. The International Committee for the Nomenclature of Viruses (ICNV, later renamed International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, ICTV, in 1975) accepted the scientific named Transmissible gastro-enteritis virus of swine in its first report in 1971, but renamed it Porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (PTGV) in its second report in 1976. There was another case of coronavirus infection in cats in 1966. The virus caused inflammation of the abdomen (peritonitis) and was highly fatal. The virus was identified in 1968, and was named as Feline infectious peritonitis virus by ICTV in 1991. It was again renamed Feline coronavirus in 1999. In 1974 there was an outbreak of viral infection among US military dogs. The virus was identified as a coronavirus and the formal name Canine coronavirus was adopted by ICTV in 1991. As the molecular and antigenic relationship of the three viruses were later established in the late 1980s, ICTV merged them into a single species Alphacoronavirus 1 in 2009.

It established an Iron and Steel Corporation which acquired certain iron and steel companies. In a departure from earlier nationalisations the Corporation only acquired the share capital of the companies, not the undertakings themselves. The individual companies continued to operate under management Boards appointed by the corporation. The Iron and Steel Act 1949 was one of a number of Acts promulgated by the post-war Labour government to nationalise elements of the UK's industrial infrastructure; other Acts include the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946; the Electricity Act 1947; Transport Act 1947 (railways and long-distance road haulage); and the Gas Act 1948.  Background  The involvement of the UK government in the iron and steel industry began in the interwar period with the establishment of the British Iron and Steel Federation to represent companies in the industry, and which fixed prices, production quotas, levies, and closed redundant works under Government supervision. The iron and steel industry came under the control of the Ministry of Supply during the Second World War. In 1945 the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Sir Oliver Franks, published a report on the future of the industry. Franks recommended a radical modernisation with the aim of reducing prices to keep British steel competitive on the world market. In 1946 the Labour government established an Iron and Steel Board, to control the price of raw materials, finished products, and steel imports; and to regulate investment, pooling arrangements, and the development of new plant and equipment. Board members were appointed by the Minister of Supply and represented industry employers, workers and consumers. Full nationalisation of the industry, as opposed to government control, had been pledged by the incoming Labour government in 1945; however, this was a controversial issue and was opposed by the iron and steel companies and by the Conservative opposition.  Provisions of the Bill  The Iron and Steel Bill as first drafted comprised 46 Clauses under 8 heads. * National Iron and Steel Board ** Clauses 1 ‚Äì 4: Establishment of the National Iron and Steel Board; its constitution and appointment by the Minister of Supply; its duties; permitted activities; power to establish and liquidate its companies. * Powers of the Minister in relation to the Board ** Clauses 5 ‚Äì 8: General directions; framing of programmes; annual reports and accounts; consultation on the acquisition and disposing of undertakings, * Registration and Licensing of Iron and Steel Undertakings ** Clauses 9 ‚Äì 11: Undertakings to register with the Minister; calling for information; requirement to have a license, * Acquisition of Undertakings by the Board ** Clauses 12 ‚Äì 22: Acquisition notices; securities; representation of shareholders; rights of transferred companies to continue to use assets; efficient operation; limitation of dividends, * Terms of Purchase ** Clauses 23 ‚Äì 25: Compensation for transferred assets, * Financial Provisions ** Clauses 26 ‚Äì 35: Borrowing and raising money; creating and issuing of stock; reserve fund; accounts and annual statement, * Arbitration Tribunal ** Clauses 36 ‚Äì 38: Establishment of tribunal; remuneration; enforcement Orders, * Miscellaneous and General ** Clauses 39 ‚Äì 46: Acquisition of land; terms and conditions of employment; making of Regulations; prohibition of iron ore import; liabilities and penalties; interpretation; application to Northern Ireland. During the passage of the Bill through Parliament the proposed Iron and Steel Board became the Iron and Steel Corporation.  Enactment and provisions  The Iron and Steel Act 1949 (12 & 13 Geo. 6. c. 72) received Royal Assent on 24 November 1949. The Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain was established under the provisions of the Act with effect from October 1950. It brought 94 iron and steel companies into public ownership with effect from vesting day, the 15 February 1951. The 1949 Act also established an Iron and Steel Consumers' Council. This had the duty ‚Äòof making representations to the Minister on such matters affecting the interests of the consumers as the Council think necessary‚Äô.Hansard HC Debate 27 April 1949 vol 464 cc237-85  Operation of the Act  The model of nationalisation enacted by the 1949 Act was different to earlier ones, such as Coal Industry Nationalisation Act 1946. Only the share capital of the companies was acquired, not the undertakings themselves. The individual companies therefore continued to operate under management Boards appointed by the corporation. The mode of nationalisation was distinct because many iron and steel companies undertook other integrated activities, that could not easily be segregated into their individual functions. For example, the manufacturers of motor vehicles, which undertook steel processing, were excluded. About 2,000 iron and steel companies operated outside the nationalised sector.See Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain  Observations on the Act  The 1949 Act has been seen as both the culmination of the Labour government's nationalisation policy and as a major departure from that policy. It completed the list of major industrial infrastructures to be brought into state control and introduced collective ownership, and a certain amount of competition, into a manufacturing industry. It has also been seen as significant as it 'sheds light on the policy of nationalisation'. It has been described as being doctrinally inspired. And 'a highly exceptional measure... pushed through Parliament with great vigour and determination'. It has been seen as ‚Äònationalisation for clearly ideological reasons‚Äô; since the government 'was so persistent with a measure which can fairly be described as in no way popular'. It was argued that the iron and steel industry was progressive and efficient with good labour relations. And that public ownership was necessary to compel the industry to follow a policy in the national interest. Although different to the nationalisation of the coal, transport, electricity and gas industries the method of nationalisation through the acquisition of shares was similar to that used for the Bank of England (1946) and Cable and Wireless Limited (1947).  Government policy and later enactments  Nationalisation of iron and steel production had been strongly opposed by the Conservative opposition. On returning to power in October 1951 they planned to denationalise and return the industry to the private sector. This policy was enacted through the Iron and Steel Act 1953. The Iron and Steel Act 1953 (1 & 2 Eliz. 2 c. 15) received Royal Assent on 14 May 1953. Section 1 of the 1953 Act repealed the Iron and Steel Act 1949 and dissolved the Iron and Steel Corporation. It transferred the corporation's properties, rights, liabilities and obligations to a newly established Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency. The Agency gradually sold the nationalised companies back into the private sector with the exception of Richard Thomas and Baldwins which remained in public ownership until it was absorbed into the British Steel Corporation in 1967. The 1953 act also established a new Iron and Steel Board which began operating on 13 July 1953. The Board had a duty 'to exercise a general supervision over the iron and steel industry... with a view to promoting the efficient, economic and adequate supply, under competitive conditions, of iron and steel products'. The work of the Board and the Agency was thus parallel and complementary. The 1953 Act remained in force until the Labour government re-nationalised the iron and steel industry in 1967 through the Iron and Steel Act 1967.

She sank and ran aground many times, the final sinking being by torpedo in 1917. Triumph first went to China, where she ran ashore in the Yangtze. After being refloated she returned to England, where she was chartered for the New Zealand trade. On her first voyage south she carried 322 emigrants and steerage passengers from Plymouth to Auckland.  1884-1887  After leaving Auckland on 29 November 1883, she ran aground close to a lighthouse, on rocks on an island in the harbour. The Nautical Court concluded that the grounding was due to the quartermaster being given orders to steer with the lighthouse on the port bow, as the captain was feeling tired. In January 1884 George Fraser successfully salvaged Triumph from the shore at Tiritiri Island, having purchased the vessel for ¬£2,100 he had it afloat and in Auckland harbour within weeks. However, Triumph was too long for the dry dock, which was then near Princes Wharf, so a coffer-dam had to be constructed. Repairs to the steamer required 100 tons of plates and angle irons. This dock was situated near the present Prince's Wharf. After the fore part of the vessel had been repaired she was taken out and placed in stern first for repairs to the keel and twisted rudder post. In 1885 Triumph went to Sydney for a survey, prior to a proposed sale as a troopship during the Russian scare. That fell through, so she resumed trade to India and Britain. During this period she stranded at Bluff, but suffered no damage. Hopes of profits from Triumph faded with a mid 1880s recession, so she was sold in Britain in 1888.  1888-1917  In 1888 she sank at the mouth of the Tyne, after colliding with S.S. Rivas, with a cargo of coal, but was refloated, and again, with railway iron on board, she sank in the Clyde. She ran ashore in Norway and was abandoned until again refloated and repaired. Then she was sold to a Spanish firm, being renamed the Gladitano. During the Spanish-American War she sank while anchoring in a Florida port. Yet again Triumph was raised and sold in 1910 to the Matson Navigation Company, to run between Honolulu and San Francisco as the Hilonian, converted as an oil-burner. In 1917 she was sold to Pacific Freighters Co. A German submarine finally sank her in 1917, when in use as a troopship.

It was the decisive engagement during the Battle of Transylvania, and also the largest, involving four armies out of the five fighting in the region: two Romanian, one German and one Austro- Hungarian. German General Erich von Falkenhayn planned to surround and annihilate the entire I Corps of General Ioan Culcer's Romanian 1st Army. Although this failed - the bulk of the Romanian force including almost its entire artillery managing to escape - the battle was still decisive in that it compelled the Romanian abandonment of Transylvania. Midway into the battle, the Romanian 2nd Army tried to relieve the besieged I Corps, attacking both the flank of the German 9th Army and the western flank of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army. Thus, in the second half of the battle, two more armies joined the fray. Background At the onset of the Romanian Campaign, starting on 27 August 1916 with the Battle of Transylvania, the Romanian 1st Army (General Ioan Culcer) consisted of six divisions, of which four comprised the I Corps (General Ioan Popovici). In the middle of September, General Culcer moved the I Corps headquarters to Nagytalm√°cs (TƒÉlmaciu/Talmesch). General Popovici arrived in Nagytalm√°cs along with his staff on 16 September. Popovici had two divisions under his command at Nagyszeben (Sibiu/Hermannstadt): the 13th and the 23rd. While concentrating their forces northwest of Nagyszeben in preparation for the impending battle for that city, the Germans kept the Romanians under artillery fire in order to keep them from sending out patrols that could have discovered the German build-up. Romanian frustration with having to endure this bombardment boiled over, and on 22 September General Popovici ordered his 13th Division to take the heights at Veresmart (Ro»ôia/Rothberg), east of Nagyszeben. Although this action was against Culcer's orders, it was still Culcer himself who decided to appoint Popovici as commander of the two Romanian divisions headquartered at Nagytalm√°cs. Although Popovici's attack failed in its immediate aim, it succeeded in worsening the strategic situation of the Central Powers, driving a wedge between the two divisions of a German-led Cavalry Corps. If exploited, this wedge could ruin the German plans to secure Nagyszeben (Sibiu/Hermannstadt). On the following day (23 September), the German Alpine Corps began their march through the mountains to the Red Tower pass, behind Romanian lines.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 103-107 During the march of the German Alpine Corps, the left of the Central Powers forces - the German column which was to encircle the Romanians from the east - succeeded in forcing the crossing of the Olt River at Kolun (Colun/Kellen), east of Porumb√°k. Thus, an effective barrier was created between the 1st and the 2nd Romanian armies. In its advance across the mountain ridge separating the valleys of the Hortob√°gy (H√¢rtibaciu/Haarbach) and Olt Rivers, this German column was faced with determined resistance. Still, its numerical superiority enabled it to prevail.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 228John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres, p. 233 By the evening of 25 September, Kolun was in German hands.Edmund Glaise-Horstenau, √ñsterreich-Ungarns letzter Krieg 1914 ‚Äì 1918. Vol. 5: Das Kriegsjahr 1916 ; 2 ; Beil, Verl. der Milit√§rwiss. Mitteilungen, Wien, 1932 Falkenhayn's plan On 19 September, Erich von Falkenhayn assumed command of the German 9th Army. This army subsequently started assembling the bulk of its forces near Nagyszeben. Von Falkenhayn divided his forces into three groups: the XXXIX Reserve Corps, the Alpine Corps and Cavalry Corps Schmettow. His plan was bold: the annihilation of the Romanian units around Nagyszeben. Konrad Krafft von Dellmensingen's Alpine Corps Division was to act as an anvil, seizing the Red Tower Pass in order to block a Romanian retreat. Hermann von Staabs's Corps, assembling northwest of Nagyszeben, was to act as a hammer, driving southeast towards the mouth of the Red Tower Pass at Nagytalm√°cs (TƒÉlmaciu/Talmesch). With the Alpine Corps blocking the Romanian line of retreat, the XXXIX Corps would smash the Romanians against the mountains. Von Schmettow's cavalry had to maintain contact with the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army, make sure that none of the Romanians escaped east, and block any reinforcements coming from the Romanian 2nd Army, threatening the 9th Army's flank.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 100 and 102-103 Popovici relied on the mountains to protect his flanks. However, reconnaissance by the German Alpine Corps revealed that it was possible to bypass his western flank, on foot, through the mountains, then reach and cut off the Romanian line of retreat. This made Popovici's corps the most tempting target, and von Falkenhayn stressed as much: all else was secondary to striking a decisive blow at Nagyszeben.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, pp. 341 and 344 Units involved (forces and deployments) On the Romanian side, General Popovici had two divisions at Nagyszeben: the 23rd Division to the south and west of the highway running from Nagyszeben to the Red Tower Pass and the 13th Division to the east of this highway. The 23rd was commanded by General Matei Castri»ô and the 13th by General Ioan Oprescu. The two divisions formed the I Corps, headquartered at Nagytalm√°cs since 16 September. The Romanian divisions occupied a line of 25 miles, a large distance even by Eastern Front standards. General Popovici kept his units in the forward trenches, meaning that - given the length of the front - there were no reserves and no depth. General Culcer - Popovici's superior as overall commander of the Romanian 1st Army - was aware of these issues, but his attempts to get Popovici to shorten his lines and form a reserve were unsuccessful.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 103-104 and 106-107 The Romanian front extended east and west, with Sellenberk (»òelimbƒÉr/Schellenberg) for its center. To the east, the extreme right wing of the Romanian lines reached Porumb√°k (Porumbacu/Bornbach), in the valley of the Olt River. To the west, the Romanian front extended to the Szecsel (SƒÉcel/Schwarzwasser) - Orl√°t (Orlat/Winsberg) - Popl√°ka (Poplaca/Gunzendorf) line. A gap of 15 miles intervened between the extreme right of this front (Porumb√°k) and the vanguard of the Romanian 2nd Army, west of Fogaras (FƒÉgƒÉra»ô/Fogarasch). The left wing of this Romanian group had no connection either to the west or to the south. The two wings extended like the branches of a tree, their trunk being the road and railway going through the Red Tower Pass. Over 10 miles of tall mountains separated this Romanian front from the Romanian border.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 226 The Romanians were supplied by only one railway line, while von Falkenhayn had three supply lines.Lieutenant-Colonel E.

Culcer passed this information on to Popovici, adding that it was confirmed by two other reports. In response to these reports, Popovici sent two battalions into the mountains: one battalion and some guns for the protection of the Red Tower Pass and another battalion was dispatched to protect the regions west of the pass.Michael B.

Mitteilungen, Wien, 1932 On the side of the Central Powers, the XXXIX Corps alone had 35 battalions, each with 500-600 men, as well as 54 artillery batteries. The Romanian I Corps had 25 battalions, each with over 800 men, as well as 16 artillery batteries (including 2 batteries of 120 mm howitzers).Marshall Cavendish, 1984, The Marshall Cavendish Illustrated Encyclopedia of World War I, Volume 5, p. 1600 Of the 54 artillery batteries fielded by the Central Powers, 13 were heavy, whilst of the 16 Romanian batteries, only 2 were heavy.Marshall Cavendish, 1984, The Marshall Cavendish Illustrated Encyclopedia of World War I, Volume 6, p. 1717 Part of the Central Powers artillery came from the Alpine Corps division. The terrain and absence of roads in its area of operations prevented this division from using its artillery, and as such this was sent to reinforce the XXXIX Corps. Instead, this division used two batteries of Austro-Hungarian mountain artillery, 70 mm guns of the M99 type. These could be disassembled and carried on soldiers' backs.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 104-105 The Alpine Corps division totaled 9 infantry battalions.Lieutenant-Colonel E. M. Benitez, Command and General Staff School, 1939, Quarterly Review of Military Literature, Volume 19, Issue 73, p. 9 During this battle, both sides - numerically speaking - were more or less equal, although the Central Powers disposed of vast superiority in artillery.Curtis Brown, Stackpole Books, Feb 1, 1991, Roots of Strategy: Book 3, p. 461 The Romanians disposed of 3 reconnaissance aircraft, but only one was operational, and it failed to spot all the German forces that were assembling.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, p. 341 The Central Powers force that von Falkenhayn managed to assemble was not quite as large as he intended. Following his victory against the Romanians at the First Battle of Petrozs√©ny (18 - 22 September), Falkenhayn pulled out most of the German forces from that sector of the front - 4 battalions out of 6 - leaving only two, along with two batteries. Although he wanted to move these two battalions to Nagyszeben as well, Sunkel told him that this was out of the question. The two battalions along with the 144th Austro-Hungarian Infantry Brigade were defeated by the successful Romanian counterattack launched on 25 September (Second Battle of Petrozs√©ny). In response, von Falkenhayn had to send away further officers, including a general. These comprised the newly formed 301st Division, a headquarters staff without troops whose role was to provide an additional control element. This unit was led by General .Michael B.

The First-third of the New Volumes, Volume 30, p. 916 Battle Course of the battle Northern front (26 - 27 September) The attack of the German 9th army began at dawn on the 26th. Von Staabs had his divisions deployed with the 187th to the West, the 51st Honv√©d in the center and the 76th Reserve Division to the east. In clear weather, the XXXIX Corps got off to a slow start, meeting determined resistance.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 107-108 The Romanians, by then aware of their critical position, had commenced a general retreat to the southeast. Strong rearguards were covering this movement. The 187th Division ran almost immediately into strongly held positions. The villages of Szecsel, Orl√°t, Popl√°ka and Gurar√≥ (Gura R√¢ului/Auendorf) had to be captured one by one, swaying battles being fought in their streets. Gurar√≥ and Popl√°ka in particular were noted by Falkenhayn for their resistance. Although the villages were captured during the evening, the Romanians remained in their strong positions on the Cioara, Valare and Obreju heights. The 51st Honv√©d Division did not advance as it was expecting the 187th Division to prepare the way. The 76th Reserve Division did not actually make it into the battle, being held up by the rough terrain east of Nagyszeben.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 229Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, pp. 344-345 The slow start of the Central Powers on the 26th was due to more than Romanian resistance. Von Staabs had ineffectively distributed his guns among all his units equally, meaning that no unit had the power to breach the Romanian lines. Enraged, von Falkenhayn told him to fix the problem by massing the artillery. After this was accomplished, the attack resumed on the 27th. On that day, the 9th Army continued its drive south, its reorganized artillery blasting gaps in the enemy lines. Von Falkenhayn was exasperated to end the battle, giving von Staabs the army's reserve force: the 89th Division and the 8th Landwehr Brigade. These two units were still unloading at Segesv√°r (Sighi»ôoara/Sch√§√üburg), 25 miles away, too far away to be of help. The German High Command gave von Falkenhayn control of the 89th Division on that same day, 27 September. By nightfall, the Germans had made significant gains against the Romanians.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 107-109 During the 27th, German and Hungarian regiments slowly made their way through Dolm√°ny (Daia/Thalheim), Bong√°rd (Bungard/Baumgarten) and Herm√°ny (Ca»ôol»õ/Kastenholz), also capturing the 601 meters-tall Grigori height (the northernmost Romanian position, northeast of Nagyszeben). Not every detachment received the order to retreat while this was still possible, and the Romanians suffered considerable losses during their withdrawal from the encircled positions.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, pp. 226 and 229 On the 27th, fighting also took place at Nagydiszn√≥d (CisnƒÉdie/Heltau), a local district capital.Birgitta Gabriela Hannover, Trescher Verlag, 2011, Siebenb√ºrgen: rund um Kronstadt, Sch√§√üburg und Hermannstadt, p.122 (in German) The Central Powers troops were surprised to find large numbers of civilians among the dead and wounded in the Romanian trenches. Many locals of Romanian descent had attempted to retreat along with the Romanian Army, but were killed in the German bombardment.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, p. 346 Southern front (26 - 27 September) On the morning of the 26th, the Alpine Corps occupied the Red Tower Pass at several points: on the northern (Transylvanian) side at the village known by the German name of Kaiserbrunnen, and on the southern (Romanian) side at R√¢u Vadului and C√¢ineni railway stations. As fighting on the northern front intensified, the Romanians became aware of the German forces in their rear and undertook some ineffective measures to drive them out. General Popovici sent his 48th Infantry Regiment from the north, but the J√§gers - positioned in the hills above Kaiserbrunnen - decimated the unit with machine-gun fire. The Romanians moved to the east side of the valley, where they could pass safely, being largely out of range. Although the Germans were able to block the road traffic, they could not completely block the pass due to lacking their field artillery, left behind because of the impossibility of moving it through the mountains. Although the Germans had a few Austro-Hungarian mountain guns, these lacked the stopping power of the larger field pieces. On the southern end of the pass, the Romanians fared better. Lieutenant-Colonel Toma Popescu, a staff officer of the 1st Army carrying messages for Popovici, came across the Bavarian Guards of Prince Heinrich's III Battalion at the C√¢ineni bridge. Immediately recognizing the threat, the Romanian officer rounded up 13 day laborers from the village and marched them to the Mayor's office. There, he found some rifles, before sending the now-armed men into the hills above the bridge. Under the leadership of a Police Sergeant and an army straggler, the Romanians put the Germans under fire, with such success that the Bavarians became confused and started searching the east side of the pass. With the Germans distracted by this fruitless task, Popescu headed south and came across a Romanian J√§ger battalion with two howitzers at Brezoiu. Dividing this force into two columns, he sent one north to C√¢ineni and the other west to fall on the Bavarians from the rear. Popescu's attack succeeded, Prince Heinrich's men abandoning the bridge and town as night fell.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 109-110 For the moment, the Romanians were able to prevent the Germans from becoming established.Marshall Cavendish, 1984, The Marshall Cavendish Illustrated Encyclopedia of World War I, Volume 5, p. 1600 On 27 September, the Romanians realized the seriousness of the situation when reinforcements were unable to get through the pass. Popovici sent 5 battalions south and managed to drive the Alpine Corps J√§gers from the northern part of the defile and out of most of R√¢u Vadului as well. But the Germans still remained in the center area, jamming up Romanian convoys in bloody engagements. At the southern end, Prince Heinrich's III Battalion had reoccupied C√¢ineni and Lunci Point. All day long, battalions from the Romanian 20th Division attacked from the south, trading possession of the disputed bridges with the Germans throughout the day. Traffic came to a halt as the Romanians waited for the cover of darkness, when they could move units with greater safety.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 110 On the 27th, 37 men from an advanced section of the 9th Company of the Bavarian Guard Regiment were captured by the Romanians at R√¢u Vadului. The Romanians robbed and mistreated them, avowedly in revenge for the heavy losses that they had suffered in the preceding fighting. During the morning of the next day, the Romanians led them to a nearby riverbed, where they were fired upon by a unit commanded by an elderly officer. Ten of them were killed immediately, twelve more were seriously wounded. Nearby J√§gers, seeing what happened, recklessly attacked. The sudden intervention of German machine-gun fire prevented the massacre of all defenseless prisoners, driving off the Romanians in panic. Supposedly, the executions were authorized by General David Praporgescu (20th Division commander). The Germans spread word about this atrocity, and it became known even in Bucharest. As a result, anger ran high among 9th Army units, who subsequently had little desire to take prisoners.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 118Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, p. 344 Romanian retreat (28 - 29 September) The critical day of the battle had arrived. The morning of the 28th started off well for the Central Powers. The situation continued to deteriorate for Popovici, when the XXXIX Corps started making progress against the main Romanian positions, driving his beleaguered battalions back into the mouth of the Red Tower Pass. Although driven out of its main line of defenses, Popovici's force remained unbroken. The 187th Division advanced steadily. Flanking units also pressed forward as Romanian resistance diminished. The German forces in the Red Tower Pass were involved in heavy fighting everywhere, and the danger of them being wiped out was high. There were multiple signs of a partial Romanian collapse: wrecked guns and vehicles, corpses and dead animals. However, although there was no longer determined resistance, the haul of prisoners remained very small. The main Romanian group remained intact, still disposing of substantial forces despite being clear that it had suffered very heavy losses. As von Falkenhayn himself noted: \\"Seldom in my life, which had not lacked dramatic moments, had I awaited the outcome with such suspense as on the morning of 29 September.\\". Romanian morale plummeted as exaggerated rumors about the situation in the pass reached the front line troops. Exaggerated accounts of German bombing of railway stations and staff headquarters served to further demoralize the Romanians. At 7 p.m., Popovici met with the commander of the 23rd Division - General Castri»ô - who reported that his forces had retreated to their last defensive line. By then, contact with most units was lost, including the 13th Division. Disheartened by the incessant German shelling and believing that no help would reach him, Popovici decided to save what was possible by retreating south down the pass. He formed his units into 3 columns, with a center of supply wagons, ambulances, artillery pieces, livestock and trains, with the infantry on the outside. The 44th Infantry Regiment comprised the vanguard. The 23rd Division was ordered to hold the enemy to the north for as long as possible, the same orders being conveyed to the 13th Division by Popovici's Chief of Staff. Around 10:30 pm, with Popovici in the lead, the column headed south.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 111Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, pp. 346-347Marshall Cavendish, 1984, The Marshall Cavendish Illustrated Encyclopedia of World War I, Volume 5, p. 1600 Popovici had given the strictest orders for silence, but once the Alpine Corps spotted the Romanians and put them under fire, his panicked soldiers shouted and cursed at their animals, which bolted. Military police and gendarmes were unable to keep order. In this chaos, infantry columns stopped and waited for hours, while wagon columns galloped south at full speed. At V√∂r√∂storony (Turnu Ro»ôu/Rothenturm), artillery had to be used to blast away a barricade of dead horses and wagons assembled by the Germans. \\"The cries of the wounded, the machine-gun and rifle fire, the bellowing of the animals and the roaring waters of the Olt all echoed in the narrow passage, adding to the hellishness of the scene.\\". At 5:30 a.m., the wagon column was halted by machine-gun fire coming from the Lunci Point railway station. The vanguard regiment and two artillery batteries did not succeed in dislodging the Germans. The Romanians offered cash prizes to clear the Germans. After an hour, and only after the Romanians assaulted the buildings and bayoneted to death everyone inside, did the shooting cease. The Romanian column resumed its march south. At 2:30 p.m. on the 29th, Popovici's column staggered out of the pass and into C√¢ineni and safety.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 112 For the Romanian infantry, it was a question of infiltrating back by various border paths across the FƒÉgƒÉra»ô Mountains, east of the Olt River.Marshall Cavendish, 1984, The Marshall Cavendish Illustrated Encyclopedia of World War I, Volume 5, p. 1600 Relief attempt by the Romanian 2nd Army (28 - 29 September) As the I Corps remained almost under siege, the leaders of the Romanian Army were compelled to attempt its relief. The 2nd Army - 3 divisions strong at the time - attacked on September 28 and 29, driving against the flank of the German 9th Army among skillfully retreating German and Austro-Hungarian forces.Marshall Cavendish, 1984, The Marshall Cavendish Illustrated Encyclopedia of World War I, Volume 5, p. 1600 During the early morning of the 28th, von Schmettow reported that the Romanians had driven a wedge between his 6th Austro-Hungarian Cavalry Brigade and the 71st Austro-Hungarian Division of the Austro-Hungarian 1st Army. A gap a dozen miles wide was opened and the entire 9th Army was exposed to a flank attack. The 89th Division - von Falkenhayn's last reserve - was coming south from Segesv√°r and began to march into the area between the two armies, but Falkenhayn feared that the Romanians would overwhelm it. Pressure on the extreme western flank of the Austro- Hungarian 1st Army drove back a weak Hungarian cavalry detachment and the battered 71st Division. Falkenhayn was alarmed to receive a message from the usually aggressive Curt von Morgen - whose I Reserve Corps commanded this flank of Arz's 1st Army - that he viewed a further retreat as almost inevitable. The actions of the Romanian 2nd Army contributed to von Falkenhayn's troubled night's sleep that evening. On the 29th, as the battle came to a conclusion, the 2nd Army's 3rd Division drove the 2nd Honv√©d Cavalry Division back north across the Hortob√°gy (H√¢rtibaciu/Haar) Creek. This drive threatened what had become the juncture of the two Central Powers armies.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 111 and 115Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, pp. 346-347 The 2nd Romanian Army executed its movements slowly and with difficulty. An advance along the shortest line in the Olt Valley might have been easily threatened, so the Romanians felt themselves compelled to ensure freedom of movement north of the Olt River. Therefore, the forward sections of the 71st Infantry Division were the first to be pressed back. Then, the 6th Cavalry Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division - standing north of Kissink (Cinc»ôor/Kleinschenk) - was thrown back westwards. Pushing between the 71st Division and the Cavalry Corps, the 89th Division carried out on 28 September a successful attack to the south, temporarily halting the advance of the Romanian troops north of the Olt. However, the Romanians resumed their offensive during the afternoon of that same day, attacking the 1st Cavalry Division north of the Olt and pressing it back to the heights east of the Hortob√°gy. The German reserve, not required at Nagyszeben, was swiftly deployed with heavy motor wagons through the Hortob√°gy Valley to the aid of the heavily engaged Schmettow Cavalry Corps. On the 29th, the Romanians pushed rapidly and violently in the space between the Hortob√°gy and the Olt. To the surprise of the Central Powers, the Romanians did not continue the attack north of the Olt on 30 September.Encyclop√¶dia britannica Company, Limited, 1922, The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: The New Volumes, Constituting, in Combination with the Twenty-nine Volumes of the Eleventh Edition, the Twelfth Edition of that Work, and Also Supplying a New, Distinctive, and Independent Library of Reference Dealing with Events and Developments of the Period 1910 to 1921 Inclusive. The First-third of the New Volumes, Volume 30, p. 917 During its advance on the 28th, the Romanian 2nd Army gained several settlements, most notably the village of Nagysink (Cincu/Gro√üschenk), a district (j√°r√°s) capital within the Nagy-K√ºk√ºll≈ë County.Edmund Glaise- Horstenau, √ñsterreich-Ungarns letzter Krieg 1914 ‚Äì 1918.

Mitteilungen, Wien, 1932 Ultimately, the 2nd Army forced its way as far as Porumb√°k, but by that time the Romanian detachment - which had stood there on the extreme right wing of Popovici's Corps - had been forced to retreat to the east, and the German forces continued to separate the two armies.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 229John Buchan, T.

Nevertheless, his retreat did manage to save the soldiers under his command. The Central Powers captured from the Romanian 1st Army 13 guns, 6 machine-guns, 2 aircraft (out of 3) and 3,000 prisoners. Other losses included 10 locomotives with 700 loaded railway wagons (300 of small arms ammunition, 200 of artillery munitions and 200 filled with baggage), 70 cars and trucks, a hospital train and a paymaster's supplies.Michael B.

Thus, \\"by some miracle\\", almost the entire artillery of the Romanian corps was saved.Marshall Cavendish, 1984, The Marshall Cavendish Illustrated Encyclopedia of World War I, Volume 5, p. 1600 The loss of the 6 machine-guns captured by the Central Powers was more than made up for by Culcer's almost simultaneous offensive further west, during which the Romanians captured 7 machine-guns.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 226 The ground losses of the Romanian 2nd Army are unknown, but it did lose one aircraft along with its pilot. This pilot had been given a message for Popovici, but he landed behind German lines and was taken prisoner on 29 September.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, p. 353 The losses of the Central Powers are mostly unknown. However, during their retreat to C√¢ineni, the Romanians did succeed in capturing 300 prisoners.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, pp. 229-230 Analysis In spite of the heroic efforts of the Alpine Corps in the Red Tower Pass, the bulk of the Romanian force had escaped. The infantry discovered that they could stay outside the effective range of German machine- guns by pressing along the east side of the pass. The wagon column was restricted to the road, thus taking the brunt of the losses.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 113 The Romanians escaped complete destruction by abandoning any attempt to recover the Red Tower Pass, instead marching southeastwards across the Fogaras Mountains, thus turning the pass. Due to a lack of good roads, Falkenhayn had judged such a maneuver impossible.Lieutenant-Colonel E. M. Benitez, Command and General Staff School, 1939, Quarterly Review of Military Literature, Volume 19, Issue 73, p. 9 The strenuous efforts of fresh Romanian forces to clear the Red Tower Pass from the south did not succeed in freeing that highway, though they did much to ensure the Romanian retreat to the southeast.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 229 The German force in the mountains was too weak for its task. It was not strong enough at the beginning of the battle, let alone after the Romanians had been reinforced. It was probably impossible to throw stronger forces against the Red Tower Pass, a decisive victory being therefore beyond Falkenhayn's powers. He was thus unable to reap all the benefits from his successful surprise. Although the Romanian I Corps was thoroughly beaten in this battle, the German forces which operated against its rear were too weak to achieve its annihilation.Curtis Brown, Stackpole Books, Feb 1, 1991, Roots of Strategy: Book 3, p. 461 In consequence, the Romanian troops which defeated the first Central Powers offensive south of the Red Tower Pass in late October were those beaten at Nagyszeben in September.Marshall Cavendish, 1984, The Marshall Cavendish Illustrated Encyclopedia of World War I, Volume 6, p. 1720 Although this victory was not decisive in the sense intended by von Falkenhayn, it was still decisive in that it compelled the Romanian abandonment of Transylvania.C.R.M.F.

Misconceptions Some sources erroneously identify the Romanian general commanding the two divisions at Nagyszeben as Manolescu.Lieutenant-Colonel E. M. Benitez, Command and General Staff School, 1939, Quarterly Review of Military Literature, Volume 19, Issue 73, p. 9 Originally, Popovici's I Corps comprised four divisions instead of two, and it had responsibility for operations in both the Jiu and the Olt valleys. Given the distances involved, this was problematic. Thus, several days into the campaign, General Culcer decided to make the two divisions at the Olt a de facto corps headquarters, with General in charge. In mid-September, Culcer moved the I Corps headquarters to Nagytalm√°cs to assume command of the two divisions located there. Popovici and his staff arrived in Nagytalm√°cs on 16 September. After a tour of the front with Popovici, the distraught General Manolescu announced that his nerves had failed him and he left for Romania.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 103-104 Thus, while a general named Manolescu did command the two Romanian divisions at Nagyszeben, he had been replaced for over a week by Popovici by the time the battle started. Some sources may erroneously refer to the Central Powers attempt at annihilating the Romanian forces north of the Red Tower Pass as a success. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, for instance, states that the Romanian defeat became a \\"complete collapse\\", that it was an \\"annihilating defeat\\", that the bulk of the Romanian 1st Army was destroyed. While this source does acknowledge the \\"relatively small number\\" of 3,000 prisoners, it wrongly states that the whole of the artillery was also captured.Encyclop√¶dia britannica Company, Limited, 1922, The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: The New Volumes, Constituting, in Combination with the Twenty-nine Volumes of the Eleventh Edition, the Twelfth Edition of that Work, and Also Supplying a New, Distinctive, and Independent Library of Reference Dealing with Events and Developments of the Period 1910 to 1921 Inclusive. The First-third of the New Volumes, Volume 30, p. 917 Most sources state otherwise: the bulk of the Romanian forces escaped and almost the entire artillery of the Romanian corps was saved. The core Romanian losses of 3,000 prisoners and 13 guns captured are almost universally agreed upon among the sources.Michael B.

Constructed from 1062 to 1231 CE during the reign of the Chaulukya dynasty, they are noted for their elaborate architecture.  History  Kumbharia was one of the most important Jain centres during the Chaulukya period. It is said that 360 temples once existed in the region but were destroyed due to volcanic activity and only five remain. These five Jain temples were constructed from 1062 to 1231 CE: *Mahavira temple was built in 1062. This is the earliest Jain temple. *Shantinath temple was built in 1082. *Parshvanath temple was built in 1094 by the Chalukyan king Jayasimha Siddharaja. *Neminath temple was built a little later during the reign of Jayasimha Siddharaja. *Sambhavanatha temple was built in 1231. It is however unlikely that volcanism has directly destroyed any temples as there has not been any evidence of active volcanoes in India for over 500 thousand years (except on the Andaman Islands). Earthquake activity in India is however significant and may account for the destruction of such temples.  Architecture  The Kumbharia Jain temples are famous for their elaborate architecture. Along with the Dilwara temples, Girnar Jain temples, and Taranga Jain temple, they are considered excellent examples of Chaulukyan architecture. The Mahavira, Shantinatha, and Parshvanatha temples in the Kumbharia Jain temple complex are some of the most renowned Jain temples in India. These five marble temples vary in size, image carvings, and architectural detail, with each having its own characteristics. Every temple is surrounded by a protective walled courtyard with elaborate porched gateways.  Mahavira temple  Rosette ceiling in Mahavira temple Mahavira temple, also known as Arasana samghacaitya, is the temple of the Jain congregation at Arasana (Aras in Gujarati means marble). This temple's marble ceiling depicts scenes from Bahubali's life. The upper panel has a depiction of a war between Bahubali and Bharata chakravartin, showing both armies' horses, elephants, and soldiers. The lower panel depicts a duel between two brothers. The centre panel has an image of Bahubali in meditation being approached by Bharata and his wife. Another ceiling features carvings of the past and future tirthankara with their parents. The ceiling of the temple's porch houses a depiction of multi-tier Samavasarana.  Shantinatha temple  Shantinatha temple is similar to Mahavira temple. According to inscriptions, Shantinatha temple was originally dedicated to Rishabhanatha. The temple houses an important icon depicting Ashtapad and dating to 1210 CE. The Ashtapad idol is a diamond-shaped altar that depicts the mountain with images of 24 tirthankars facing all four cardinal directions on two levels. The top of the icon depicts the Samavasarana of Rishabhanatha with a chaumukha image of Rishabhanatha.  Parshvanatha temple  The ceiling of Parshvanatha temple bears an image of Parshvanatha with a hood of snakes similar to those of Vimal Vasahi. The temple's stone idol of Ajitnatha stands on a pedestal bearing an elephant symbol. The temple features nine highly decked dev-kulikas. The torana-stambha features carvings of vidyadevi, aparaicakra, Purusudatta, Mahakali, Vajrasnrnkhala, Vajarankusa, and Rohini. The temple contains images of Sarvanha and Ambika as shasan-devata with the hood of a snake overhead.  Neminatha temple  The pillars of the Neminatha temple are ornately carved in a manner similar to those of Vimal Vasahi. This temple contains an image of the Hindu god Ganesha that is similar to that of Luna Vasahi and the Ranakpur Jain temple. The temple includes miniature carvings of vidya-devi like aparaicakra, Vajrasnrnkhala, Sarvastra- Mahajvala, Rohini, and Vairotya, which were popular iconographies in western India during the 11th and 12th centuries. According to an inscription, the munisuvrata-bimba was installed in 1281 CE (VS 1338).  Sambhavanatha temple  The Sambhavanatha temple is a small temple and a typical example of rich Chaulukyan architecture. According to an inscription in the Mahavira temple, the idol was gifted by \\"Pahini\\" in 1085 CE and the temple was originally dedicated to Shantinatha.. The original idol of the temple was later mutilated and replaced with a new idol. The temple has a representation of the Hindu goddess Saraswati on its ceiling.  Conservation  The temples, which have undergone repairs, renovations, and modifications, are managed by the Anandji Kalyanji Trust.

It is situated in the Cascade Range, one mile northeast of Coldwater Lake, and west of Mount Whittier. Its nearest higher neighbor is Mount Venus, to the northeast, Coldwater Peak rises to the south, and Mount St. Helens is to the south. Although modest in elevation, relief is significant as the summit rises 3,000 feet above the Coldwater Creek valley in less than one mile. Precipitation runoff from Minnie Peak drains south into Coldwater Creek, or north into Miners Creek, both of which are part of the North Fork Toutle River drainage basin. This peak's name is derived from the Minnie mining claim nearby along Miners Creek. The primary minerals extracted there were silver and copper.Minnie Alice Prospect, Westernmininghistory.com Geology Summit detail The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity occurred. The lateral blast from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was pointed toward Minnie Peak and stripped the vegetation from its slopes. Due to Mount St. Helens' proximity to Minnie Peak, volcanic ash is common in the area. Minnie Peak and nearby Mount Whittier are composed of resistant granodiorite of the Spirit Lake pluton, which is a complex of once-molten rock that intruded the surrounding rocks approximately 20 million years ago. Patrick T. Pringle, ROADSIDE GEOLOGY OF MOUNT ST. HELENS NATIONAL VOLCANIC MONUMENT AND VICINITY, 1993, pg. 51. Climate Minnie Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Minnie Peak and Coldwater LakeMost weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.

The chemical name is 2-glyceryl-3-octyl ascorbic acid. The isomer in which these two groups are swapped (2-octyl-3-glyceryl ascorbic acid, OG- VC) is also known. It is considered as a new stable amphipathic in the field of aesthetic medicine.  Overview  Vitamin C is rapidly converted to ascorbic acid radicals by UV rays, which causes cytotoxicity and sunburn, but GO-VC improves the stability of conventional vitamin C derivatives, and thus eliminates the problems of these prooxidants. Water-soluble vitamin C derivatives, such as sodium ascorbyl phosphate (APS), which have been used since the 1990s, have a problem of drying the skin in order to the sebum suppression effect. On the other hand, GO-VC has a high moisturizing power due to the binding of glycerin and can prevent the dryness of the skin. In addition, GO-VC has a sterilizing activity of octanol, so it has a sterilizing activity against many bacteria. GO-VC is also used for wound healing and wrinkle prevention because it has a proliferative effect on fibroblasts and a promoting effect on type I collagen production. GO-VC has a stronger melanin production inhibitory effect than arbutin, which is used as a whitening agent, and it was confirmed in clinical trials that even low concentrations of 0.01 to 0.1% (by weight) are effective against acne redness and pigmentation. The water-soluble vitamin C derivatives such as ascorbic acid 2 - glucoside and APPS (trisodium ascorbyl palmitate) can not add to water-soluble polymer gels commonly used in cosmetics such as carboxy vinyl polymer and sodium polyacrylate. This is because the viscosity changes, causing precipitation. On the other hand, GO-VC can be dispersed in water-soluble polymer gel transparently and uniformly or can be stably dissolved for a long time. The Fat-soluble vitamin C derivatives such as ascorbyl tetrahexyl decanoate (VC- IP) are almost insoluble in water, making it difficult to mix in water-soluble formulations such as lotions without the use of surfactants. Fat-soluble vitamin C derivatives causes lipid oxidation problems when lipids are released, and the color of the formulation tends to change. GO-VC can solve these problems almost completely. GO-VC is well absorbed percutaneously due to its amphiphilic nature, and because it is negatively charged rather than completely non-ionic, it can facilitate percutaneous absorption with an iontophoresis device. In addition, GO-VC is amphipathic but does not have a lipid group, so there are few skin toxicity problems due to lipid peroxidation, and it does not have the sticky feeling of conventional vitamin C derivatives and has a good feel.  Stability  When the aqueous solution containing vitamin C and GO-VC was stored at 50 ¬∞C for 90 days, the vitamin C residual amount decreased to less than 30% in 30 days, whereas the residual amount of GO-VC was 90% or more. Moreover, after 90 days, 80% or more of GO-VC was confirmed to remain. It is considered that these high stability are due to the two most reactive hydroxyl groups of vitamin C being capped by glycerin and octanol at the same time. Because the viscosity is stable in the preparation containing GO-VC and the polymer gel too, and it can be kept in a transparent state for a long period of time. Therefore, GO-VC can be added to many preparations such as lotions, creams, serums and gels.  Acne  It was reported that GO-VC is effective against post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH), post-inflammatory erythema (PIE), and atrophic scar (AS), which are important complications in acne. It applied a complex vitamin C derivative lotion containing GO-VC to each of 10 patients with acne twice on the right side twice a day for 3 months, and confirmed the left side without application and its effect. It was reported that there was a marked improvement in PIH, PIE, and AS on the only right side applying lotion containing GO-VC after 3 months.  Pigmentation  Many phenolic compounds, which are conventional whitening agents, react with tyrosinase to induce melanocyte-specific cytotoxicity, and thus there was a risk of developing vitiligo. GO-VC reduced the intracellular melanin content of B16 melanoma cells. GO-VC's pigmentation inhibitory mechanism is shown to act through a novel melanogenesis inhibitory system that does not depend on tyrosinase activity inhibition, indicating that it is a safe and effective pigmentation inhibitor with low risk of vitiligo. GO-VC showed a remarkable effect in an actual pigmentation suppression clinical study, and a gel preparation containing 0.1% GO-VC was applied twice a day in the morning and evening on the entire face after 13 female subjects aged 39.8 years on average. As a result of a 1-5 month study, GO-VC significantly improved post-inflammatory pigmentation. It is reported that GO- VC also showed a clear improvement in pigmentation caused by metal allergy, which was not very effective when applied with hydroquinone.  Skin pore related diseases  Since conventional water-soluble vitamin C does not easily penetrate the skin barrier, an amphipathic vitamin C derivative was developed to improve this. However, since lipids such as palmitic acid were chemical modified to ViraminC derivatives in the past, exposure to ultraviolet light generated free fatty acids, raising concerns about lipid peroxidation. It was thought that GO-VC could avoid the problem of lipid peroxidation because GO-VC is amphipathic with octanol instead of lipid. The effect of 0.05% gel of GO-VC was investigated on skin pore related diseases. As a result, it was confirmed that there were no side effects and the number of abnormal pores decreased to 70% or less within 1 to 2 months after application.

The Crimes That Bind was released on August 20, 2020 on Netflix. Plot summary In this understated film, Alicia, played by Cecilia Roth, the mother of Daniel, played by Benjam√≠n Amadeo, is blinded by her unconditional love for her 35-year-old son, and unable to even consider the possibility that he could be guilty of assault, rape, stalking, and violence against women. The film begins with Alicia hosting her socialite friends in their Buenos Aires, Argentina apartment in one of the capital city's most luxurious neighborhoods, where she lives with her 70-year-old retired engineer husband, Ignacio, played by Miguel √Ångel Sol√°, her live-in maid Gladys, played by Yanina √Åvila, and Gladys's 3-year old son, Santiago (Santi), who calls Alicia Auntie. Gladys has a humble background. Her mother died when she was about three or four years old and she lived with her father, who neglected and abused her in a remote forested area. She became an unpaid servant to her father's second wife and her step-siblings until her teen years, when she escaped to Buenos Aires with the help of a neighbor, where she was hired by Alicia. Both Alicia and her husband are portrayed as dignified and courteous, while Gladys is portrayed as \\"simple\\" and slow. These assumptions are unsettled as the story unfolds involving two court cases and prison sentences. Daniel stands trial and is imprisoned for the attempted murder of his ex-wife, Marcela, played by Sof√≠a Gala Castiglione. Gladys is accused and convicted of murder for suffocating her newborn baby in her living quarters in Alicia and Ignacio's home. For most of the film, Gladys is portrayed as a passive, emotionless prisoner, who remains silent in her own defense, which makes it impossible for her lawyer, Vieytes, to help her. She receives a particularly harsh punishment of 17 years of imprisonment. Alicia is present in both courtrooms. At the conclusion of Gladys's trial, to Vieytes' surprise, Gladys makes a statement in which she apologizes to Alicia for the mistreatment she has been subjected to in court and thanks Alicia for taking such good care of Santi. She asks the court to grant Alicia custody of Santi. In Daniel's court case, evidence against him mounts, and it appears that he will be found guilty. Alicia's wealthier friends abandon her. The administration at Santi's expensive preschool tells her that she should enroll him in a school with more diversity where he would better fit in. In her confusion and in desperation to help her son, who she believes to be innocent, Alicia decides to hire an expensive criminal defense lawyer. Ignacio warns Alicia that the lawyer she wants to hire is unscrupulous. He is known for using expensive bribes and other means outside the courts to win his cases. When she tells Ignacio that she wants to downsize to a less expensive apartment and to cut spending in order to hire this lawyer, Ignacio tells her that he is leaving her. Santi misses his mother, Gladys. Alicia takes him to the prison where Gladys is held. It is her first visit with Gladys since she was imprisoned. Alicia had strongly criticized Gladys for her actions when she testified against her in court. She also lied under oath when she denied warning Gladys that if she got pregnant a second time there would be consequences. Vieytes suggested that Gladys' motivation for killing her own newborn was partly out of fear of losing both her secure job and her housing. During the prison visit, Gladys tells Alicia that Daniel had come to their home during a period in which he had been estranged from his parents. He had asked to come in and Gladys had let him. He then stole money from his parents and raped Gladys, leaving her pregnant. Daniel threatened to hurt Gladys and Santi if she told Alicia or anyone what he had done. The baby she killed was Alicia's grandson, and Gladys wanted Alicia to accept custody of Santi. As part of her inner journey, which leads to accepting that her son is the perpetrator, not a victim in the crimes against his ex-wife, his young child, and Gladys, Alicia begins to understand more about the complexity of violence against women from the psychologist and activist played by Paola Barrientos. As Alicia comes to understand the full implication of what Gladys had told her, she becomes an ally for both of Daniel's victims, Marcela and Gladys. She provides Marcela, and by extension, Gladys, with the crucial evidence Marcela needs to win her case against Daniel‚Äîevidence that Alicia had acquired as part of the $400,000 fee to the lawyer who had succeeded in getting Daniel released from prison by suppressing evidence. In one of the final scenes, Alicia, the psychologist and Vieytes are entering the courtroom where Gladys is appealing her sentence. The film ends with Alicia attending a family gathering with Santi, Marcela, and Alicia's grandson, with Marcela's family and friends, in a much humbler but happier home than that in which the film begins. Reviews A review in Media, Entertainment, Arts, WorldWide (MEAWW), described the film as an \\"enthralling\\" and \\"enticing crime drama\\". According to the Film Affinity site, critic Diego Batlle said it was a \\"remarkable\\", \\"rigorous, ambitious and intelligent\\" \\"judicial thriller\\"; Film Affinity John Serba, in the Decider, said that the setting, characters and theme made it \\"absorbing\\" if not \\"always original or well written\\". A review in the La Nacion called it a \\"solid psychological thriller\\". One The New York Times's review called it a \\"gloomy melodrama\\" and compared it to the 2019 Netflix film The Son, by the same director, Sebasti√°n Schindel.

He is considered the greatest modern contributor to the preservation of the endangered Cherokee language. Early life Feeling was born on April 2, 1946, to Jeff and Elizabeth Feeling in the Little Rock community east of Locust Grove, Oklahoma. Cherokee was his first language; he learned English when he was in the first grade. He began to read Cherokee syllabary when he was 12 years old. Feeling was a Baptist. Feeling graduated from Chilocco Indian School (a Native American boarding school) in 1964 and earned an associate's degree from Bacone College in 1966. He was drafted into the Army in 1967 and served as a door gunner during the Vietnam War. He began to write in Cherokee syllabary when corresponding with his mother while he was in Vietnam. He was awarded a Purple Heart, and he was honorably discharged in 1970. Career Durbin began his work with the Cherokee language when he returned from Vietnam. In 1975, Feeling co-wrote the first Cherokee‚ÄìEnglish dictionary. It remains the \\"standard publication for Cherokee language reference\\". Feeling earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from Northeastern State University in 1979 and earned a master's degree in social sciences from the University of California, Irvine in 1992. Feeling taught Cherokee at universities including the University of Oklahoma, the University of Tulsa, and the University of California. He authored or contributed to many books and research articles about Cherokee. His materials for Cherokee language learners remain widely used, and many Cherokee teachers themselves learned from Feeling. Feeling worked for the Cherokee Nation from 1976 to 2020, including in its language translation and technology department. In the 1980s, he added the Cherokee syllabary to a word processor. He also contributed to the addition of the Cherokee syllabary to Unicode, which allows it to be widely available on computers and smartphones. Impact, death, and legacy For his contributions to the preservation of Cherokee, Feeling was named a National Treasure by the Cherokee Nation and awarded an honorary doctorate by Ohio State University. Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin, Jr. has called Feeling \\"a modern-day Sequoyah\\" (referring to the inventor of the Cherokee syllabary) and said that \\"[e]verything we are doing for language revitalization is because of Durbin.‚Äù In 2019, the Cherokee Nation chose Feeling to be the first signatory of the Cherokee Language Speakers Roll. Feeling died August 19, 2020. The Cherokee Nation's planned language learning center will be named the Durbin Feeling Language Center in Feeling's honor.

After the First world war his family moved to Stryi, as for that moment - Poland. He studied at the Faculty of Law of Lviv University (graduated in 1937) and Stryi branch of Mykola Lysenko Higher Music Institute. He also graduated from the Consular Academy in Vienna in 1939. At the age of 16 he started writing music, at the age of 22 he wrote one of his most popular songs - \\"There will come another time\\" (–ü—Ä–∏–π–¥–µ —â–µ —á–∞—Å). Already the first musical works brought Bohdan Vesolovsky fame. In the 1930s, together with the violinist Leonid Yablonsky and the accordionist Anatoliy Kos-Anatolsky, he was a member of Jablonsky Jazz Chapel (Yabtso-Jazz; the soloist was Iryna Yarosevych). The jazz band was a great success at parties of Lviv youth of the interwar period, in particular at corporate balls. During the World war II he was an officer in Austria-German boundary. Since 1949 lived in Canada. In Canada Bohdan Vesolovsky worked as a chief-editor of Ukrainian version of Radio Canada International in Montreal. In 1960 Vesolovsky was allowed to visit USSR. Vesolovsky died in Monreal were was buried. Upon 20 years reburied in Stryi according to his testament.  Legacy  According to Bohdan Vesolovsky, the immediate impetus of his composing skills was the lack of Ukrainian entertainment music. At that time, Polish music dominated. Only quality could compete with it.Lukanov The song heritage of the composer includes more than 130 works. Songs of the first (Lviv) period are mainly tango, foxtrot, light waltz. The lyrics of these songs was mostly about love. In the following years, the songs acquired a bright civic sound (\\"Fly, sad song\\" and \\"Charm of the Carpathian Mountains\\"). After the World war II songs by Vesolovsky were forbidden in USSR, though were performed anonymously. The revival of Veselovsky's music in Ukraine rises in 2000s.

Born in Bogota, Colombia, Garcia- Velasquez began his musical education through the violin at the age of seven. In 2002, he started studying composition at the Pontifical Xavierian University in Bogota under the mentorship of Harold Vasquez-Castaneda. He obtained his degree in 2006. In 2007, he moved to France to continue his studies at the Conservatoire √† rayonnement regional de Boulogne-Billancourt with Jean-Luc Herv√©. He was later admitted into the Conservatoire de Paris (CNSMDP) in the class of Fr√©d√©ric Durieux, where he graduated in 2013. In 2008, in parallel with his studies in composition, Garcia-Velasquez co-founded Le Balcon ensemble alongside pianist Alphonse Cemin, conductor Maxime Pascal, composer Juan-Pablo Carre√±o and sound engineer Florent Derex. In 2009, he co- founded BabaelScores, a digital music library, alongside composer Lucas Fagin. He has been an artist-in-residence at the Th√©√¢tre de l‚ÄôAth√©n√©e between 2013 and 2018, at the IRCAM and ZKM on 2017, and at the Fondation Singer-Polignac since 2019. In 2016 he received the Prix Pierre Cardin from the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts.  Music composition  Pedro Garcia-Velasquez work has explored the concept of Gesamtkunstwerk on several occasions, and from different angles. The idea of a ‚Äúsynthesis of the arts‚Äù was already present at a very early stage of his creations and it has evolved through time in increasingly complex ways. In 2012, he started a collaboration with scene-artist Nieto in order to conceive Scratched Shadows, a piece with video-stage musicians. This cooperation opened Garcia-Velasquez to new possibilities in terms of what forms of arts, such as video, dance, installation, or sculpture, could be integrated into the composition's creation process. Long-term cooperation with choreographer Tatiana Julien, from 2012 to 2017, brought to life several pieces integrating dance and composition, among them, INITIO in 2018, a co- written choreographic opera for the Th√©√¢tre National de Chaillot. Recently he has been working with artist Marion Flament in the creation of automated sound sculptures integrated into his pieces Un vaso de dicha, for the Fondation Singer-Polignac, and a prelude and interludes for Gustav Mahler‚Äôs Das Lied von Der Erde, for the Festival Saint-Denis 2020. One of his main interests is the creation of immersive sound universes using 3D sound techniques, such as specialized sound and the use of the binaural technique (3D sound on headphones). Sound and space are conceived to bring the spectator into a sensory experience evoking specific landscapes, like forests, or buildings such as churches, alongside music. Lieux Perdus ‚Äì Th√©√¢tre acoustique I, for 4 singers, chamber orchestra and 3D sound system, is a piece that developed this idea of surrounding the spectator. It was produced in collaboration with stage director Benjamin Lazar on 2014 and has a sequel, F√™te dans le vide : Th√©√¢tre acoustique II, for soprano, chamber orchestra, and 3D sound system, produced in 2015.

He held the nobiliary title of Marquis of Albaida.  Biography  Born in Laredo on 14 October 1803. He was a member of the Citizen Militia during the 1820‚Äì1823 Trienio Liberal. Having fought against the invading French army known as the Hundred Thousand Sons of Saint Louis, he exiled to England, returning to Spain after the death of Ferdinand VII, the Felon King. He was elected as deputy in 1844 in representation of Palencia. From then on, he became more salient in the radicalism of his proposals than the mainstream Progressive Party. He advocated the Iberian Union in his 1844 electoral platform. He inherited the Marquisate of Albaida in 1847. He participated in the and stood in the barricades in the . Also a participant in the 1854 revolution, he took part in the intentona of Los Basilios on 28 August, leading to his imprisonment. He actively campaigned in favour of the abolition of slavery in the Cortes of 1854‚Äì1856. He revolted against the O'Donnell-R√≠os Rosas involutionary government in 1856, encouraging the general uprising. Yet again imprisoned, he exiled to France and Belgium. Picture taken in Early 1869 in Madrid, featuring (from left to right) Fernando Garrido, , Jos√© Mar√≠a Orense (seated), √âlie Reclus and Giuseppi Fanelli. A proponent of Iberism, he argued again in favour of such prospect in 1858 in La Discusi√≥n, proposing a conception of the Iberian union based on a community of common interests, to be achieved extending the privileges of the Basque provinces to the rest of Spain, and then undergoing a progressive convergence with Portugal. He returned to Madrid on the occasion of the September 1868 Glorious Revolution, and gave no pause to the provisional government. Following the September Revolution Orense became the president of the after the exit of Salustiano de Ol√≥zaga from the organization. He also presided the meeting of the Democratic Party on 11 October 1868 at the Circo Price during which it was determined that the federal republic shall be the form of government of Spain, followed by the schism between the republicans and the accidentalist . An active campaigner for the Republic, he was elected at the 1869 election to Constituent Cortes. Within the stem of federal republicanism he embraced an individualist strand of workerism associated to romantic humanitarianism and social liberalism (differentiating from other leanings converging into the federal republicanism such as the socialist republicanism of Fernando Garrido and Pi y Margall or the trend represented by the krausists), and in fact, similarly to Giuseppe Mazzini, he ultimately became weary of socialism, as he came to blame it for the demise of the Second French Republic. Cartoon depicting the struggle between those supporting the Unitary Republic and those supporting the Federal Republic (La Flaca, 1873) He participated in the insurrections that took place months after the enactment of the new Constitution in June 1869. He went to Tours and organized the unit of Spanish volunteers (including his son) to help France following the Prusian invasion in 1870, rallying the banner of the Universal Republic and the Latin Federation. He returned to Spain to vote against the candidacy of Amadeo of Savoy to be the head of State of Spain, becoming an active Republican agitator. After the proclamation of the First Spanish Republic in February 1873 and the May 1873 election, he briefly served as president of the Congress of Deputies in June 1873. He moved away from Spain after the 3 January 1874 coup of Pav√≠a, yet he ultimately returned to the country to establish in Astillero, Santander, for his later years. Having become blind, and his health becoming deteriorated, he died on 29 October 1880.

Student years  During 1918 he transferred to the University of Turin. He was initially uncertain whether to enrol in the Mathematics Faculty or in the Humanities (\\"facolt√† di lettere\\") faculty: in the end he opted for the latter. Soon after arriving at the university he had his first encounter with the future anti-fascist journalist Piero Gobetti, in the context of a competition in which they were both involved for a student-bursary from Turin's \\"Collegio delle province\\". Sap√©gno's education initially led him to view the political world through the prism of the influential liberal philosopher-polemicist Benedetto Croce, and he quickly became a friend of Gobetti, and after its launch in 1922, a backer of Gobetti's (as matters turned out short-lived) cultural and political weekly publication, La Rivoluzione liberale. While he was still at university Sap√©gno's father died young, in 1919. By the time he died Giuseppe Maria Sap√©gno had risen to become head of the Turin Tax Office (\\" segretario capo dell‚ÄôIntendenza di Finanza di Torino\\"), and the sudden loss of his salary left the family in financial difficulties. Nevertheless, Natalino Sap√©gno continued to attend the university. On 10 July 1922 he graduated with a doctorate. His dissertation was supervised by Vittorio Cian and concerned the vernacular work of the Franciscan Umbrian friar Jacopone da Todi. Later he was able, in two successive months, to base two articles published in literary journals on his doctoral work. The text was later revised and published in book form in 1926.  Post-graduate years  During 1924 Sap√©gno edited for publication a selection of philosophical pamphlets by Thomas Aquinas as part of a series being produced under the leadership of Giovanni Papini by Rocco Carabba's publishing business. The series title was \\"Cultura dell‚Äôanima\\" (loosely, \\"Culture of the spirit\\"). He also worked for a year during 1923/24 as a replacement teacher at the \\"Regina Maria Adelaide\\" teacher training institute in Aosta. It was on the basis of this that in 1924 he won a national competition for the teaching of Italian and History.  Ferrara and Berta  Towards the end of 1924 he relocated to Ferrara (roughly equidistant between Bologna and Padua) where for some years he taught \\"literary subjects\\" - principally Italian and History - in various secondary schools.‚ÄúNatalino Sapegno‚Äù, in Biografie e bibliografie degli Accademici Lincei, Roma, Accademia dei Lincei, 1976, p. 1267. In addition, between September 1925 and December 1936 he taught at the Vincenzo Monti Technical College. It was while working as a teacher in Emilia-Romagna that he came to know Berta Ghedini, who was also working as a teacher in the city. The two of them married in July 1929. The marriage, which was childless, ended with the early death of Berta in 1937.  Switch to the universities sector  In 1930 Sap√©gno obtained a Libera docenza qualification, which under the Italian system permitted him to teach at a university level while not being a full-time member of a university. Between 1932 and 1936 he taught courses in Italian Literature on a free-lance basis at the nearby University of Padua. Between 1930 and 1936 he also at some stage worked on a similar basis at the venerable University of Bologna. Throughout this period he was also building his profile among Italian intellectuals with regular scholarly contributions to specialist journals such as \\"Archivum Romanicum\\", \\"Leonardo\\", \\"La Nuova Italia\\", \\"Pegaso\\" and \\"Civilt√† Moderna\\". His published contributions included a succession of reviews on the works of Montale, Saba, Sbarbaro, Tecchi, Pavolini and Govoni. In terms of establishing his reputation within the academic community, the volume \\"Il Trecento\\" (\\"The fourteenth century\\"), written in 1933 and published in 1934, was probably more important than any of those learned literary reviews on the output of contemporary literati, however. The book was published by Valardi in Milan as part of the \\"Storia letteraria d‚ÄôItalia\\" (\\"History of Italian Literature\\") series, replacing an earlier volume on the topic which had appeared in 1902. The replacement from Natalino Sap√©gno was well received by scholars: thanks, in particular, to a favourable review published in 1934 by Giulio Bertoni of the \\"Soci√©t√© de linguistique romane\\", won for its author one of the (four) 1934 prizes awarded by the Accademia d‚ÄôItalia. Despite being among his first books published, it remains probably the best known of his books. In 1936 he participated in the nationwide competition organised by the University of Messina to fa the vacancy that had arisen at the for an extraordinary professorship in Italian literature. There were no fewer than 29 candidates for evaluation by the ad hoc appointments commission, of whom no fewer than 13 were already well established in their university careers. The appointments commission included Senate President Federzoni, indicating the political importance attaching to the job. Natalino Sap√©gno was one of three candidates shortlisted for an interview session in Palermo. The upshot of this was that he was offered and accepted the extraordinary professorship, based not at Messina but along the coast at the University of Palermo.  Rome  As matters turned out, Natalino Sap√©gno's first full-time university appointment lasted only a year. At the end of 1937 he succeeded Vittorio Rossi, by now in the final months of his illness, with a professorship at the Sapienza University of Rome. The alternative candidate, Luigi Russo, was almost a decade older than Sap√©gno and came with what was almost certainly a more conventional background in the universities sector. Sap√©gno's appointment triggered lasting bitterness on Russi's part. However, the university authorities were persuaded to prefer Sap√©gno, based on a decision communicated from the Education Minister, Giuseppe Bottai. Public government support for the appointment might lead to the assumption that Sap√©gno might not remain in post after the fall of fascism in 1943, but in fact he continued to teach at the Sapienza till 1976. During the early years of his long incumbency he taught courses on Poliziano, Dante, Boccaccio, Ariosto and Pulci, thereby cementing his reputation as an authority on the fourteenth and fifteenth century Italian literary dawn. On 16 December 1939 he was promoted to a full professorship (\\"... nominato ordinario\\").  Maria Elisabetta Posta  Natalino Sap√©gno married Maria Elisabetta Posta, his second wife, in 1938. The marriage was followed by the births of the couple's two daughter, Simonetta and Silvia.  War years  Between 1938 and 1943 Sap√©gno had links to the Roman anti-fascist movement, which was well represented among the academics at the Sapienza. Partisan activists to whom he was close included Pietro Ingrao and Carlo Muscetta, along with several of his students, such as Carlo Salinari and Mario Alicata, who became his assistant at some point around 1941. Sources are nevertheless unclear and at times appear contradictory over the extent of his practical commitment to the anti-government cause.  Later years  In the aftermath of two decades of fascism incorporating half a decade of destructive war, a readjustment of Sap√©gno's philosophical underpinnings could not be avoided. Many anti-fascist intellectuals of his generation faced some of the same dilemmas. The uncompromisingly idealistic liberal anti-fascist philosophy of Croce would always remain as his starting point; but he also came increasingly under the influence of Gramsci, whereby in his own writings he moved towards a singular fusion of Historicism and Marxism which, in terms of traditional Anglo-American thought patterns, defies easy pigeon- holing.Natalino Sapegno, ‚ÄòMarxismo, cultura, poesia‚Äô, Rinascita, 2, no. 7‚Äì8 (1945), pp. 182‚Äì84 In 1954 he was elected to the Accademia dei Lincei as a corresponding member. He became a full national member (\\"Soci nazionali\\") in 1966. He remained active, frequently in the public eye, almost to the end. His many other memberships took in the Accademia dell'Arcadia, the Rome Philological Society, the European Culture Society and the PEN International. Between 1986 and 1990, along with his other engagements, Sap√©gno served as president of the Viareggio [literary] Prize. During the post-war decades Sap√©gno wrote and published extensively. Sources highlight, in particular, his collaboration with Emilio Cecchi on the \\"History of Italian Literature\\" (\\"Storia della letteratura italiana\\"), published by Garzanti in nine volumes between 1966 and 1969. Natalino Sap√©gno died in Rome on 11 April 1990. His physical remains were removed for burial to Aosta, identified by surviving family members as his home city, however.  Output (selection)  Natalino Sap√©gno foundation  On 3 September 1991 the Regional Government of the Valle d'Aosta gave its backing to Sap√©gno's widow and their two daughters for the setting up of the \\"Centro di studi storico-letterari Natalino Sapegno\\" (\\"Natalino Sapegno History and Literature Study Centre\\") in order to honour Sap√©gno and perpetuate his memory, to be based at Morgex, twenty minutes up- river from the Aosta municipality along the road towards Mont Blanc and the tunnel.

After being convicted for a brutal triple murder, he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, without being prosecuted for his other known killings. Murders A career criminal with a string of convictions for violent sexual offenses, Walker's first admitted murder was that of 24-year-old Arleen Salcedo in 1975. Her decomposing body was found on September 22, 1975, in a field two miles south of Blissfield. The cause of death couldn't be determined, and the case remained unsolved for a long period of time. Later that year, Anthony was arrested for kidnapping and raping a woman in his hometown of Adrian. The kidnapping charge was dropped, but he pleaded guilty to second-degree criminal sexual conduct and received a few years imprisonment. In early January 1979, he was paroled. On January 15th, while looking for a house to rob, Walker set his sights on a small house on West Maple Avenue in Adrian, where 24-year-old Puerto Rican native Yolanda Torres Madison and her 11-month-old daughter Jessica were living, accompanied by 19-year-old Theresa Carey, a friend of Yolanda who was visiting the house that night. Sensing an opportunity, he broke into the home, tying up and beating up both women before finally shooting them. After stealing valuables and money from the house, he set the house on fire in order to cover his tracks, which caused the little Jessica to suffocate from smoke inhalation. Francisco 'Tito' Torres, Yolanda's brother, later went to the house and, sensing that something was off, began to pound on the front door since nobody was answering. When he noticed the smoke, he called the fire department, who managed to put out the fire. After examining the site, the bodies of the three victims were located. An autopsy determined that Madison and Carey had been killed prior to the house being set ablaze, and that the child had died as a result of it. Despite the severity of the crime and outrage from the local community, there wasn't enough evidence to convict anybody at the time, and the case went cold. In what was believed to be a drug-related crime, Walker was paid $2,000 by an unidentified man to kill 28-year-old Floyd Beatty on March 1st. The following morning, Beatty was found dead near the back door of his home in Manchester. Months later in September, Walker approached a trio of highschool students who were skipping school in Adrian. Claiming to be an off- duty police officer, he ordered them to get in his car and then drove to his house. There, he attempted to assault one of the girls, but decided against it, driving all three back to the downtown area, where he safely dropped them off. He was later arrested and convicted of assault, receiving a 10-to-15 imprisonment term, as a result of being a habitual offender. In 1986, while imprisoned at the now-closed Southern Michigan Institution near Jackson, Anthony paid another inmate to kill 40-year-old Daniel A. Staggs, a convict serving a life sentence for armed robbery. Staggs' body was later found in the prison's Cell Block 4, stabbed to death. His killer was never identified, and is now believed to be deceased. In June 1993, Walker was released from prison, but remained free for only a short period of time. A little over a year later, in December 1994, he was arrested for sex crimes in Wayne County, convicted of two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct and sentenced to life imprisonment, with a concurrent 15-to-30 year term before he had a chance for parole. Exposure In 2010, after technological advancements and discovery of additional witnesses, cold case investigators arraigned Anthony Guy Walker on charges of committing the Madison-Carey killings. At his trial, Walker plead guilty to killing both women, but vehemently denied setting the fire that resulted in young Jessica's death. In a shocking turn of events, he additionally admitted to committing the Salcedo and Beatty murders, and for ordering Staggs' death. In exchange for his confessions, he was not prosecuted in either case. Anthony Walker was convicted in the triple murder and sentenced to three life imprisonment terms, expressing no remorse for his crimes. According to his attorney, Robert Jameson, Walker could be responsible for more than 30 murders across Michigan and potentially other states: Anthony himself provided him with locations, dates and descriptions of the various people he had killed, either when hired or choosing to do so of his own accord. Jameson went on to state that he was more prolific than Ted Bundy himself, and had killed seven people before entering adulthood. Aftermath In 2015, Investigation Discovery broadcast a program dedicated to the case, titled \\"Rising from the Ashes\\". In it, explored how authorities and prosecutors managed to build up a case against Walker for the Madison-Carey murders.

Law Article 261 of the Polish Criminal Code states in its entirety: \\"Whoever profanes a monument or other public place commemorating a historic event or honour a person shall be subject to a fine or the penalty of restriction of liberty\\". Therefore, insulting a monument can only be done deliberately. The crime does not require physical damage to or physical contact with the monument. A separate article criminalizes property damage, otherwise known as vandalism (). One example of prohibited action under the law is \\"performing activities that are commonly recognised as discrediting the honour or memory of a person or a historic event\\". Scope of protection The law makes no distinction between worthy and unworthy objects of commemoration (such as Soviet monuments or statues of pedophiles). However, in practice those who insult Communist monuments are not punished. According to Marta Mozgawa-Saj, the law is unclear \\"whether it is possible to 'desecrate' the monument that 'commemorates persons, organisations, events or dates symbolising communism or another totalitarian system'\\". She adds that: Cases A relatively small number of people have been charged under the law, of whom not all were convicted. Former statue of Henryk Jankowski by Giennadij Jerszow in Gda≈Ñsk In 2018, Committee for the Defence of Democracy activists hung signs saying \\"konstytucja\\" (\\"constitution\\") on the Mermaid of Warsaw statue and a statue of former president Lech Kaczy≈Ñski. They were charged with insulting a monument with regards to the latter incident but not the former. In 2019, proceedings were discontinued because \\"the accused expressed his political views, and according to the provisions of the Constitution, everyone has the right to do so\\". On the night of 20‚Äì21 February 2019, three Warsaw residents toppled a statue of Henryk Jankowski in Gda≈Ñsk; Jankowski was a Catholic priest accused of sexual abuse. One of the accused was a member of Citizens of Poland and an antifascist committee at the University of Warsaw, where he was an instructor. The perpetrators stated in a manifesto that they sought to oppose \\"the presence of evil personified in the public space, contempt for and objectification of another human being, violation of their freedom and privacy, psychological terror, disrespect for the pain and anger of the victims\\". They were charged with insulting a monument and vandalism. The statue was ultimately removed but charges of insulting a monument were not dropped. In 2019, some teenagers were arrested for riding skateboards on to the victims of the Smolensk disaster in Warsaw. In late July, Stop Bzdurom placed rainbow flags and anarchist bandanas on statues of Nicolaus Copernicus, J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski, the Mermaid of Warsaw, and Jesus in Warsaw. The activists released a manifesto, stating, \\"As long as the rainbow scandalizes anybody and is treated as inappropriate we solemnly pledge to provoke\\". The action shocked some Polish Catholics, including Law and Justice Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who called the actions \\"desecration\\" and posted photographs of himself in front of the Jesus statue. On 5 August, three activists involved in the flag drapings were arrested for insulting religious feelings and insulting monuments, charged, and released after about 40 hours. Warsaw's mayor, Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, stated that he disapproved of the flag draping but criticized the arrests for violating the rule of law. According to police, the rainbow flag insults some monuments but not others. Opponents of prosecution in such cases say that rainbow is not an offensive symbol, and the activists did not intend to profane the monument. In August, rainbow flags have also been hung on monuments in Warsaw and other parts of Poland, for instance Pozna≈Ñ prosecutor Magdalena W≈Çodarczak refused to prosecute the hanging of a flag on the because of the \\"lack of features of a prohibited act\\". In September 2020, activist Ma≈Çgorzata Pingot was questioned by police after having hung a rainbow flag over the Copernicus statue in Piotrk√≥w Trybunalski on 12 August. Police had been present when the flag was raised but did not intervene. In the past, various articles had been placed on the monument, and the head was painted green, without a criminal complaint being made.

The corrupting power of the Ring has been compared to the Ring of Gyges in Plato's Republic, which gave the power of invisibility and so tempted its owner, but there is no evidence that Tolkien modelled The Lord of the Rings on that story. In the narrative Artist's representation of the Ring The One Ring was forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom during the Second Age to gain dominion over the free peoples of Middle-earth.The Fellowship of the Ring, book 1, ch. 2 \\"The Shadow of the Past\\" He intended it to control those who wore any of the other Rings of Power. Since they were powerful, he had to put much of his own power as a Maia into the Ring to achieve this.The Silmarillion, \\"Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age\\" When Sm√©agol saw the Ring that his friend D√©agol had found in the River Anduin, he killed D√©agol to get it, and used the Ring's power of invisibility: The wizard Gandalf explains that Gollum was wholly corrupted by and addicted to the Ring:  The Ring and power = The Ring's effects  A major theme is the corrupting influence of the One Ring through the power it offers, especially to those already powerful. Tom Shippey notes Gandalf's statements about the power and influence of the One Ring, and the corrupting influence it has on its bearers. Gandalf rejects the Ring for this reason when Frodo offers it to him; this view of the Ring is reinforced as Elrond, Galadriel, Aragorn and Faramir in their turn also reject it, fearing that it will overpower them as well. Inversely, the hobbits' complacency and lack of ambition makes them less susceptible to the Ring's promises of power, as in Frodo and Sam, who are able to handle the Ring for extended periods of time. Hobbits are not totally immune to the Ring's effects, however, as can be seen in the changes it works in Frodo, Bilbo and Gollum. On the other hand, Boromir becomes murderously obsessed with the Ring, but never possesses it, while Sm√©agol kills his kin D√©agol, the first Ring bearer after Isildur, to obtain the Ring.  \\"Power corrupts\\"  Lord Acton famously stated \\"Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely\\", an idea embodied in the addictive power of the One Ring. The corrupting effect of power is, according to Shippey, a modern theme, since in earlier times, power was considered to \\"reveal character\\", not alter it. Shippey quotes Lord Acton's 1887 statement: Shippey points out authors contemporary with Tolkien who dealt in the theme of the corrupting influence of power: George Orwell with Animal Farm (1945), William Golding with Lord of the Flies (1954), and T. H. White with The Once and Future King (1958). In his view, this was largely a modern idea; a medieval equivalent is the Old English \\"man de√æ swa he by√æ √æonne he mot swa he wile\\": \\"A man does as he is when he can do what he wants\\", i.e. power reveals existing character, rather than changing it for the worse. Colin Manlove criticises Tolkien's attitude towards power as inconsistent, with exceptions to the supposedly overwhelming influence of the Ring. The Ring can be handed over relatively easily (Sam and Bilbo), and removing the Ring by force (Gollum to Frodo) does not, despite Gandalf's assertion at the beginning of the story, break Frodo's mind. The Ring also appears to have little effect on characters such as Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli.  Tolkien vs Plato  The theme of a corrupting ring dates back to Plato's Republic, where the Ring of Gyges gave invisibility and thus the ability to get away with crime. The Tolkien scholar Eric Katz, however writes that \\"Plato argues that such [moral] corruption will occur, but Tolkien shows us this corruption through the thoughts and actions of his characters\\"; Plato tries to counter the \\"cynical conclusion\\" that moral life is chosen by the weak; Glaucon thinks that people are only \\"good\\" because they suppose they will be caught if they are not. Plato argues that immoral life is no good as it corrupts one's soul. So, Katz states, according to Plato a moral person has peace and happiness, and would not use a Ring of Power. Katz writes that Tolkien's story \\"demonstrate[s] various responses to the question posed by Plato: would a just person be corrupted by the possibility of almost unlimited power?\\" The question is answered in different ways: Gollum is weak, corrupted, and finally destroyed; Boromir begins virtuous but like Plato's Gyges is corrupted \\"by the temptation of power\\" from the Ring, even if he wants to use it for good, but redeems himself by defending the hobbits to his own death; the \\"strong and virtuous\\" Galadriel, who sees clearly what she would become if she accepted the ring, and rejects it; the immortal Tom Bombadil, exempt from the Ring's corrupting power and from its gift of invisibility; Sam who in a moment of need faithfully uses the ring, but is not seduced by its vision of \\"Samwise the Strong, Hero of the Age\\"; and finally Frodo who is gradually corrupted, but is saved by his earlier mercy to Gollum, and Gollum's desperation for the Ring. Katz concludes that Tolkien's answer to Plato's \\"Why be moral?\\" is \\"to be yourself\\".  Addiction  Shippey replies to Manlove's doubt with \\"one word\\": addictive. He writes that this sums up Gandalf's whole argument, as in the early stages, as with Bilbo and Sam, the addiction can be shaken off easily enough, while for those who are not yet addicted, as with Aragorn and indeed others like Galadriel and Faramir, its pull is like any other temptation. What Gandalf could not do to Frodo, Shippey writes, is make him want to hand the Ring over. And for the owner of the Ring, the destructive aspect is the urge to use it, no matter how good the intentions of the owner might be at the start. Other critics, too, have described the Ring as addictive, with each use progressively increasing the hold the Ring has over its bearer. Bilbo, while possessing the Ring for some time, is able to give it away willingly, though with considerable difficulty. Later, when he encounters the Ring in Rivendell, he experiences a powerful longing to hold it again. Frodo also shows features of addiction, ultimately being unable to relinquish the Ring of his own accord. Sm√©agol's addictive features become more pronounced as, over five centuries, he devolves into Gollum, showing traits ranging from withdrawal and isolation to suspicion and anger towards others; his obsession leads to his demise. In Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, the effects of the Ring on Bilbo and Frodo are obsessions that have been compared with drug addiction; the actor Andy Serkis, who played Gollum, cited drug addiction as an inspiration for his performance.

In many cases the crew cannot leave without losing their right to be paid. Abandonment has been described as a \\"cancer\\" of the shipping industry. If cases go to court, the sale of the vessel can be ordered, but this can take many months. Jurisdiction is often unclear because many abandoned vessels sailed under \\"flags of convenience\\" (open registries). An amendment to the Maritime Labour Convention made it easier for unpaid crew to be paid via insurance. In 2020 the International Maritime Organization (IMO) database listed 438 ships worldwide, with 5,767 crew members, abandoned since 2004; not all cases are referred to the IMO, so the actual number is larger, but unknown. In 2020, by August 470 seafarers on 31 vessels had been abandoned. A notorious case was the 2013 abandonment of MV Rhosus in Beirut, Lebanon, the unloading and storing for years of its explosive cargo, and the ensuing catastrophic explosion on 4 August 2020. A previous crew had mutinied due to unpaid wages. When the ship docked in Beirut, it was arrested for non-payment of port dues, and the owner did not respond to the captain's communications. The captain and three crew members remained on the ship, unpaid, for a year, relying on the port agent for food and water to keep them alive. The explosive cargo was unloaded as collateral for the unpaid debts, then left for years in a warehouse until it exploded. Seafarers' problems, including abandonment, in the Arab world and Iran were sufficiently severe for the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) to set up a network for the region; its coordinator said \\"The flood of calls to ITF in the Arab region has never stopped. Since we created the network and seafarers [became] aware of us, the numbers of calls are going up and up\\". the network was dealing with 15 cases of abandonment.

Description Prostanthera albohirta is an erect, spreading shrub that typically grows to a height of with densely hairy, cylindrical stems. The leaves are egg-shaped, dull green, long and wide on a petiole long. The flowers are arranged singly in four to twelve axils near the ends of branchlets, each flower on a pedicel long. The sepals are densely covered with white hairs and form a tube about long with two lobes, the lower lobe long and the upper lobe long. The petals are hairy, lilac to lavender and fused to form a tube about long. The lower lip has three lobes, the centre about long and wide and the side lobes about long and wide. The upper lip has two lobes fused with a small notch at the join. Flowering has been recorded in January. Taxonomy Prostanthera albohirta was first formally described in 1936 by Cyril Tenison White in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Queensland from specimens collected on the \\"summit of Mount Demi, alt. 3,000 ft., on exposed cliff faces\\" by Leonard John Brass. Distribution and habitat Between 1932 and 2013, this mintbush was only known from Brass's single collection and attempts to collect further specimens failed.

Start of the confloct between the President and the Supreme Council, establishment of executive power \\"hierarchy\\", multiround parliamentary election and referendum on crucial socio-economic and polytical issues, led to civil indifference towards politics, as citizens were absolutelly disoriented in such conditions. All levels of mass media almost ignored the elections, having printed only election commission registered candidates lists. Elections were held in so-called \\"summer cottage season\\" and catholic holiday of Pentecost. As a result, first round turnout amounted to 48,1% of the total number of voters. Under the effective legislation election could be considered as taken place, in case being participated by over 50% of voters. In a first round on 11 June 94,7% deputies of rural councils, 73,2% deputies of town councils, 48,5% deputies of urban councils in local cities, 17,5% deputies of urban district councils, 29,5% deputies of urban councils, 8,5% deputies of district councils, and 44% deputies of regional councils were elected. In Minsk elections did not take place in any electoral district. Out of 45 electoral districts in Vitebsk, only 1 appeared such where elections took place. 61,3% of voters participated in the second voting on the 25 June. Elections took place in 24 330 electoral districts out of 28 244; in 853 electoral districts elections took place, but no candidate was elected.

He was formerly a Trump administration appointee who served in the United States Department of Homeland Security from 2017 to 2019, including as Chief of Staff to former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and Acting Secretary Chad Wolf. In August 2020, while on leave from his job at Google, he produced an ad for Republican Voters Against Trump, denouncing Trump and endorsing Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Taylor was the first former senior Trump administration staffer to endorse Biden. As of August 2020, he is the highest-ranking former member of the administration to endorse Biden.  Early life and education  Taylor grew up in La Porte, Indiana and graduated from La Porte High School in 2006 as valedictorian. He received a Bachelor of Arts in international security studies from Indiana University Bloomington, which he attended as a Harry S. Truman Scholar and Herman B. Wells Scholar. As a senior, he received IU's inaugural Presidential Student Internship. He received an MPhil in International Relations from New College, Oxford, which he attended as a Marshall Scholar.  Career  In 2007, while in college, he interned in the office of the Secretary of Defense and the office of Vice President Dick Cheney. In 2008, he worked as Briefing Book coordinator at the Department of Homeland Security. In 2009 he served as a regional policy intern for the Defense Department. Taylor was a political appointee in the administration of George W. Bush. He was a staffer for the House Appropriations Committee and then the Committee on Homeland Security, where he was advisor to its chair, Michael McCaul. He was McCaul's chief speechwriter and the Majority Staff Lead for the congressional Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel. In 2015 he was named a Penn Kemble Fellow by the National Endowment for Democracy. From 2017 to 2019 Taylor worked at the Department of Homeland Security, including serving as Chief of Staff for Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen and Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf. In August 2020, Taylor said that in April 2019 he had personally witnessed President Trump offer Homeland Security staff federal pardons for any criminal prosecution arising from their actions in stopping illegal immigration to the United States, and at that point Taylor decided to resign from the Department. White House spokesman Judd Deere rejected Taylor's allegations, and described him as \\"another creature of the D.C. Swamp who never understood the importance of the President's agenda or why the American people elected him and clearly just wants to cash-in\\". In September 2019 Taylor was hired by Google as a government affairs and public policy manager with a title of Head of National Security. He is a senior fellow at Auburn University's McCrary Center for Cyber and Critical Infrastructure Security and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.  Campaigning for Joe Biden  In August 2020 he took a leave from Google to support Joe Biden's presidential campaign. He made an ad for Republican Voters Against Trump, denouncing Trump and endorsing Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Conservative columnist Jennifer Rubin said it was possibly \\"the most compelling of the 2020 election cycle\\". Taylor wrote an opinion piece for the Washington Post also in August 2020; Rubin said it \\"adds detail to what we could have only surmised was the story behind chaotic policy rollouts.\\" The next day, Taylor appeared on multiple news and analysis shows saying that other former members of the Trump administration were considering speaking out similarly. Journalist Judy Woodruff asked Taylor in a PBS NewsHour interview why he had spoken out when he did rather than immediately after leaving the administration. Taylor responded, Taylor was the first former senior Trump administration staffer to endorse Biden. As of August 2020, he is the highest-ranking former member of the administration to endorse Biden.  Personal life  Taylor is a lifelong member of the Republican Party.

Along the route, there are checkpoints for the Cinque Terre Trekking Card, a hiking permit instituted in 2001 by the park authority. The card is aimed at allowing the use of the services provided by the Cinque Terre National Park Authority and constitutes a sort of self- financing. The proceeds of the Cinque Terre Cards are mainly used to upkeep and restore the territory, as well as to provide transport services within the territory. The card is purchasable online as well as at any of the welcome centers found in the park.  Closures  Due to the unstable nature of the land in this area, frequent landslides result in regular trail closures. The park authorities recommend all visitors to check the status of trails prior to beginning any treks through the park. Since fall of 2019, the popular Via dell'Amore segment has been closed due to renovations to the trail, and is expected to reopen in spring 2023.

It was also a Belgian Municipality until 31 December 1976, now part of the Municipality of Plombieres. Its official name in German and Dutch is Homburg.  History = Origins  The existence of Hombourg is first recorded in 1070, as the settlement of \\"Hunborc\\". As early as 1124, the chapter of St. Peter's Collegiate Church in Li√®ge owned property in Homburg (\\"Homborgh\\") and established a court of justice.  Duchy of Limburg  Homburg was part of the Duchy of Limburg. In 1286, the castle of Vilhenru (now Vieljaeren) was destroyed by Duke John I of Brabant as part of the war of succession of the Duchy of Limburg which he seized after the Battle of Worringen in 1288. The parish of Homburg was created from the earlier parish of Teuven; the church building at Homburg dates from the 13th century, but records demonstrate the existence of the parish before that time. The seigneurie hautaine of the towns of Homburg and R√©mersdael was first granted by the King of Spain between 1560 to 1615 to Henri de Ghoer, Lord of Vieljaeren, and in 1648 to Winand and Jean- Henri d'Eynatten d'Obsinnich. Count Frederick of Eynatten sold it in 1721 to the Baroness of Hochsteden, wife of Baron Christian of Furstenberg.  From 1794 to the present day  After the second invasion of French troops in 1794, although the former Hombourg administration was supressed, the region did not submit to the new regime and awaited the return of the Austrians. An uprising broke out and led to the conjuration du Bois-Rouge at R√©mersdael on 8 February 1799, which was betrayed and led to the execution of several conspirators, including a Hombourgeois. In 1850, 85 inhabitants of R√©mersdael requested the foundation of their submunicipality, and the Monitor of 12 December 1852 published a decree separating R√©mersdael from Homburg. In the second half of the 19th century and until the First World War, the road network, municipal and school buildings were the subject of new developments and, in 1895, the Li√®ge-Plombi√®res railway line with a railway station in Hombourg was inaugurated. On the night of 3-4 August 1914, the army blew up the head of the Laschet tunnel in Homburg. This was the first tangible sign of the First World War in Belgium. During the interwar period, the Homburg barracks and the Homburg Dairy, built near the station, allowed the area to develop. During the Second World War, Homburg was annexed by the Third Reich, but most young men from the town went into hiding to avoid being conscripted to the German Army.  Languages  Since the time of the French invasions the Meuse-Rhenish dialect has been widely spoken in Hombourg. The local dialect was used in administrative documents until the 16th century, when it was supplanted by \\"Bromesch\\", the language of government of the Spanish and Austrian Netherlands. In religious matters, German has been in common use from the 18th century onwards. In the 19th century until 1910, linguistic censuses record a great number of different languages spoken by the residents of Hombourg, although some languages may have been recorded incorrectly due to the ignorance of local dialects by those carrying out the survey. The censuses of 1920 and 1930 show an increasing dominance of the French language. From 1919 the area's schools taught in French instead of German, and French also became the primary ecclesiastical language after the Second World War. Administratively, the commune has been French since 1794 (except from 1940 to 1944). At the establishment of the language areas and facilities in 1962, Hombourg adopted French is its official language for administrative purposes, in common with its 8 neighbouring municipalities. In schools, the language of instruction is French, with study of German and Dutch from the third year of primary school. Currently, about 85% of the population is French-speaking, 7% German-speaking, and 8% Dutch-speaking. About half of the French-speaking population (but mainly the age groups over 40) also know the local dialect.  Traditions  Following a procession in which a statue of the Virgin was abandoned at the roadside by the bearers of the secular (1591) Society of Saint-Brice, the parish priest founded a \\"Society of St. Joseph\\" especially to carry this statue. The village was then divided between supporters of the Society of Saint-Brice (\\"Brices\\") and the Society of St. Joseph (\\"Joupes\\"). These rivalries were reflected both at the corporate level (shooting and amenity society, youth, harmony society, theatre society) and at the level of political parties in the local council. Attempts at conciliation took place in 1914 and from 1964 to 1970 each time at the instigation of the mayor, but the rivalries continued for over a century. Today, the tension has fallen and only a friendly spirit of competition remains between the level two groups. The Hombourgeois now toast to the health of their tradition with their local craft beers, the \\"Joup\\" (brown) and the \\"Brice\\" (blonde).  Demography  In 1856, shortly after its separation from R√©mersdael, the population of Homburg was 1,127. It rose to 1,476 in 1910, falling back to 1,402 in 1920 and rising again to 1,602 in 1947. The population gradually declined to 1,279 in 1987, then rose to 1,405 in 1992 and stabilized at that figure since then.  Monuments and Curiosities = The American Cemetery of Henri-Chapelle  The 23 hectare American Cemetery of Henri-Chapelle, has nearly 8,000 graves of American soldiers and allies who fell mainly during the Battle of Aachen and the von Rundstedt offensive in the Ardennes. This cemetery initially counted two cemeteries, one American with 16,000 graves and another, a German with 9,000 graves, before being remodelled in 1960 after the repatriation of many bodies and the transfer of the German cemetery to Lommel. The new flowered and tree-lined cemetery, a mausoleum with a map museum tracing the Allied advance, were inaugurated in 1960 by General Eisenhower.

He was an expert on the thyroid gland, particularly its proteins and its relationship with radioactive iodine. Early life and education Rall was born in 1920 in Naperville, Illinois. He obtained a B.A. from North Central College in 1941 before enrolling at Northwestern University. At Northwestern, he served as a teaching assistant and a research fellow in pharmacology while completing his studies; he received a Master's degree in 1944 and an M.D. in 1945. His residency and fellowship at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, which begun in 1945, was interrupted by two years of military service in Germany with the Medical Corps following the Second World War. He eventually completed his fellowship at Mayo Clinic in 1950. He developed an interest in endocrinology, the thyroid and radioactive iodine at Mayo, and in 1952 he was awarded a PhD by the University of Minnesota for research on the metabolism of thyroxine. Career In 1950, Rall relocated to New York City to work at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center alongside Rulon Rawson, who was investigating the use of radioactive iodine in the treatment of thyroid cancer. In New York, he was an assistant professor at Cornell University Medical College and began research into radiation-induced thyroid cancer as a result of hydrogen bomb testing in the Marshall Islands. He also begun a lifelong collaboration with Jacob Robbins, with whom he studied thyroid proteins including thyroglobulin, and established the \\"free thyroxine hypothesis\\", which holds that thyroxine is only active when not bound to protein. Rall was recruited by the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, to run a new laboratory, the Clinical Endocrinology Branch (CEB), at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases. The branch initially focused on thyroid physiology and diseases, but later expanded to encompass diabetes as well as disorders of growth hormone and the gonads. Under Rall, the CEB hosted many visiting international scientists and had a longstanding association with the laboratory run by Nino Salvatore in Italy. In 1962, Rall was appointed Director of Intramural Research of the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. He served as Deputy Director for Intramural Research for NIH in 1983 until his retirement in 1990. Rall was elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, the French Soci√©t√© de biologie and the Belgian Royal Academy of Medicine, and received honorary degrees from the University of Naples (Italy) and Charles University (Czech Republic). He was president of the American Thyroid Association (ATA) in 1964 and received distinguished service awards from the ATA and the Endocrine Society. Death Rall died on February 28, 2008, aged 88.

It premiered on January 4, 2020.  Plot  Chelsea Whitmore (Lacey Chabert) is a Los Angeles-based event planner who, after missing out yet again on an anticipated Vice President promotion, decides to quit her job and move to Vail, Colorado. Here, she recently inherited the chalet of her late uncle Grady, who until his death was a well-respected pastry chef famous for his apple strudel recipe. Chelsea was once very close with him, but lost contact after her career took off. She decides to stay in town temporarily while finding her next career step. Chelsea soon finds out that the chalet needs urgent repair and hires the local contractor Owen Becker (Tyler Hynes) to help her. While he is busy remodeling the house, she gradually falls in love with the beauty of the small town; a historic alpine village that is celebrated by visitors for its Bavarian heritage. She becomes friends with Karl Becker (Grew Lawson), Owen‚Äôs father and the owner of a Bavarian restaurant. Back in the day, the restaurant was frequently visited due to Grady‚Äôs apple strudel on the menu. After his death, Karl no longer can offer customers the signature dish, and now struggles to compete against new restaurant chains run by non-locals and celebrity chefs. While repairing the house, Chelsea grows closer to Owen, and learns that he once had a promising architecture career ahead of him, but ultimately decided to stay in the small town to help his father‚Äôs business. He takes her exploring in the many scenic spots of town, and teaches her the importance of small-town values. One day, she finds the recipe of her uncle‚Äôs apple strudel and is successful in recreating the signature dish. Now that the apple strudel can be offered in the restaurant again, she decided to create buzz by organizing the so-called Strudelfest. Karl and Owen are impressed by her event planning skills, and the organization runs smoothly. However, one day her former colleague Vienna North (Marla Renae) suddenly shows up on her doorstep to, on behalf of her boss Trish Simmons (Constance Marie), offer her the Vice President position. Even though by now she is well-integrated within Vail with her next event planning gig in town already lined up, she accepts the offer, reasoning that this offer is what she worked towards for years. Back in Los Angeles, however, she soon realizes how much she misses both Vail and Owen and ultimately returns to Vail, where she finally becomes romantically involved with Owen.

She was known for her appearances in comedies alongside the actor-manager Charles Wyndham between 1885 and his retirement in 1913. Over these three decades they acted mainly in contemporary plays, many written for them by authors including Henry Arthur Jones and Hubert Henry Davies, but also appeared in classic comedies together. She continued to act on stage until 1919. She was married to the playwright James Albery from 1879 to 1889, and after his death her relationship with Wyndham eventually became romantic. After the death of Wyndham's estranged wife in 1916, he and Moore married. A capable businesswoman, Moore became Wyndham's business partner and was joint proprietor of Wyndham's Theatre and the New Theatre (now the No√´l Coward Theatre) built for him in 1899 and 1903. After Wyndham's death she founded a limited company through which she controlled the two theatres until she died in 1931, aged 69. She also was president of the Actors' Benevolent Fund.

Moore returned to the stage in March 1885 in Wyndham's provincial touring company of The Candidate in the role of Lady Dorothy Osterley, before joining the main company in London in October to take over the role of Lady Oldacre in the same play. She remained with Wyndham professionally, and later also personally, for the rest of his life. Leading lady The Times obituarist of Moore commented, \\"The year 1886 was that in which she began to emerge from the crowd\\", playing the heroine, Ada Ingot, in David Garrick. Wyndham starred in the title role and frequently revived the piece with Moore as Ada, including performances before the Prince of Wales at Sandringham and Tsar Alexander III in St Petersburg, the latter during a European tour in which the play was given in Wyndham's own German translation. Moore remained Wyndham's regular leading lady for the rest of his career. Moore and Wyndham in alt=young white woman, sitting, older white man standing, both in 18th-century costume When Wyndham began to produce and star in the plays of Henry Arthur Jones, Moore played his heroines in The Bauble Shop (1893), The Case of Rebellious Susan (1894) and The Liars (1898). Hubert Henry Davies was another dramatist who wrote star parts for her: Mrs Gorringe in Mrs Gorringe's Necklace (1903), Miss Mills in Captain Drew on Leave (1905), and best of all, according to The Times, Mrs Baxter in The Mollusc (1907).

She began by decorating the company's Heron dinnerware set (Hejrestellet), which proved to be an award-winning success in underglaze painting. She went on to contribute many of her own designs, especially vases decorated with flowers or fruits, sometimes also working with crackle-glazed porcelain. She is remembered in particular for decorating Bing & Gr√∏ndahl's Seagull set (M√•gestellet), featuring a white bird in a blue sky. Biography Born on 20 February 1855 in Norre L√∏gum parish in T√∏nder Municipality in the south of Jutland, Fanny Susanne Garde was the daughter of the parish priest Peter Christian Garde (1816‚Äì1906) and Augusta Charlotte Margrethe Law√¶tz (1826‚Äì1906). In 1876 she arrived in Copenhagen where she attended the recently established Arts and Crafts School for Women headed by Charlotte Klein. After her studies, she remained at the school until 1884 as a teacher. While there she met , establishing a close personal relationship with her and travelling with her on trips to Italy, France, England and Germany. The two worked together at G. Eifrig's K√∏benhavns Lervarefabrik in Valby in 1885 before joining Bing & Gr√∏ndahl's porcelain factory the following year. Thanks to the firms artistic director Pietro Krohn, who had been their instructor at the Arts and Crafts School, they were given a studio of their own where they decorated the Heron Set, pioneering the firm's underglaze technique. The set was successfully exhibited at Copenhagen's Nordic Exhibition in 1888 and at the Exposition Universelle in Paris in 1889. As a result, the firm was able to develop underglaze as its main approach, popularizing its blue, transparent porcelain. Although Garde worked mainly with underglaze painting, she later also used the crackle-glaze technique, becoming one of the firm's most active artists. She decorated vases and other items of porcelain with flowers and fruits in her distinctive style, achieving particular success with her Vase with Christmas Roses (1897) and her Vase with Blackberries (1907). Perhaps her most successful decorative work was the Seagull Set with a white bird flying in a blue sky. Garde presented her work at several international exhibitions, including the International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts held in Paris in 1925, where she won a gold medal. Fanny Garde died in Copenhagen on 29 April 1928 and is buried in Solbjerg Park Cemetery in Frederiksberg.

History  The 125th Mixed Brigade was created on April 28, 1937 on the basis of the Ascaso Column. The resulting unit would be integrated into the 28th Division, also newly created, with Miguel Garc√≠a Vivancos as head of the unit. Vicancos was later succeeded by Antonio Aguil√° Collantes and the latter, shortly after, by Juan Mayordomo Moreno. During the rest of the year the 125th MB was present at the Huesca front, contributing to the siege of the provincial capital and without taking part in other actions. In February 1938, while in the Monz√≥n area, it was sent to the Teruel front to aid the republican forces stationed there. After its arrival, on February 12 it attacked the nationalist positions in La Torana, without success. Between the 24th and 28th it had to face new nationalist attacks in this area, after which it withdrew to the plains of Valdecebro. Subsequently, the 125th MB took part in the Aragon and Levante offensives, where it had to withdraw on several occasions due to enemy pressure. By July 24, it was located at the XYZ Line, in Viver-J√©rica. However, due to the heavy losses suffered, it had to be withdrawn to Chelva. In August the 125th Mixed Brigade was sent to the Estremadura front, now under the command of Ricardo Mel√©ndez Ramos. To cover its losses on the Levante front, it received reinforcements from the 83rd Mixed Brigade. Upon arrival at Puebla de Alcocer, it was located as a reserve for the 28th Division, north of the \\"Vertice Cabezuela\\" - near the road that linked Cabeza del Buey with Zarza Capilla. The brigade took part in the republican attacks that tried to cut the nationalist lines in Cabeza del Buey. On September 21, it took over from the 191st Mixed Brigade on the road from Cabeza de Buey to Sancti-Sp√≠ritus. At the beginning of December the 66th Mixed Brigade relieved it of its positions and the 125th MB was sent to Chill√≥n to be subjected to a reorganization. A few weeks later, in January 1939, it participated with the rest of the division in the Battle of Pe√±arroya, where it remained until the beginning of February. During the fighting, the unit suffered casualties that affected 40% of its troops, so it was withdrawn from the front to be restructured.

For two years, he worked at Tate Britain, in the Archives, working with the personal papers of artists such as Paul Nash and Stanley Spencer. However his work at Kew Gardens, as the Assistant Curator for the Illustrations Collection at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, brought him into contact with the rich archives from Indian art collections, illustrated manuscripts, herbals and the records from the whole golden era of British exploration across the world. This included the discovery of different climates and habitats, new plants, new ways of using them, newly-discovered insects and most importantly how these phenomena were documented by the explorers and artists from the past, in particular the work of the Indian artists employed by botanists to produce beautiful paintings of Indian flora. In 2008, he produced a one-man exhibition which was shown in Richmond on the theme of producing ideas for children's books. In 2012, he received his first Kate Greenaway Medal for his illustrations in the book A Monster Calls by Patrick Ness. In 2013, he was selected personally by J. K. Rowling to present illustrations of every title in the Harry Potter series. The first book in the series, which was fully illustrated by Jim, was released on October 6, 2015. Followed by the second, the third, and the fourth book which were released in 2016, 2017 and 2019, respectively.

Sendrey is the son of the Hungarian-born composer, conductor and musicologist Alfred Szendrei. His mother, Eugenie (birth name: Eugenie Weisz), worked as a soprano at the Vienna State Opera under Gustav Mahler.

He was a student of Albert Coats, John Barbirolli and Henry Geehl. From 1935 to 1937, he worked as an arranger for film companies in Paris and from 1937 to 1944 in London. As a Jew, Sendrey fled from the National Socialists around 1933, first to Paris with his family. The Battle of France in May and June 1940 forced the family to flee further to the United States where they changed their Hungarian surname \\"Szendrei\\" to the Americanized spelling \\"Sendrey\\". Albert Sendrey settled in Hollywood. Among other works, Sendrey wrote the ballet Danse d'odalisque, three symphonies, an Oriental Suite for Orchestra (1935), a toccata and a fugue for orchestra.

It went through various significant changes in extent. Congo Free State  A decree of 1 August 1888 divided the Congo Free State into eleven districts, of which the first five were in the lower Congo region: Ubangi-U√©l√© District had its capital at Nouvelle Anvers. In 1895 the number of the districts was increased to fifteen, including Ubangi District and Uele District. An 1897 map of the Congo Free State showed Ubangi District as a long strip along the northwest border of the colony, on the left bank of the Ubangi River, which defined the border down to its confluence with the Congo River. Bangalas District was to the south and Uell√© District was to the east. In 1892 King Leopold II of Belgium declared that the Ubangi River basin and other parts of the Congo Free Statey were private domains of the state, although exploitation of rubber in parts of these domains by specific companies was allowed. Reports of missionaries show that working conditions imposed on the populations by the rubber companies was harsh and almost inhuman. Lieutenant Louis Royaux was appointed to the Ubangi District in April 1896, responsible for exploiting rubber in the district. He reached Ubangi in April 1897, and first had to reoccupy the Imesse post in south Ubangi, and build a station on the site of the former village of Libenge, which would become the district capital. Royaux reached Nanzyville territory in December 1898, but before starting rubber production had to recruit as many men as possible to fight the Batetela in Uele, who had been in rebellion since 1897. Royaux spent 1900 teaching each village about rubber harvesting, despite the insistence of the Ngbandi that there were no lianas and rubber trees in their forests. It turned out that the region was indeed poor in rubber, requiring villagers to cover long distances to places where rubber could be harvested. A skilled worker could collect perhaps of rubber in a month. In a series of atrocities, police detachments killed many villagers who had revolted, or had failed to meet their quotas. Many people fled across the river to French territory, and did not return. Those who remained were vulnerable to sickness and were impoverished since the men did not have time to work the fields, and the soldiers freely looted livestock from the villages. The traditional power structure was shaken up as village chiefs were killed or fled. Belgian Congo Ubangi District is shown on maps of 1910, 1912 and 1926 with somewhat different boundaries on each map. √âquateur Province was created in 1917. As of 1926 the province included the districts of Ubangi, Bangala, Lulonga, √âquateur and Lac L√©opold II. With the reorganization of 1933, Ubangi District and Bangala District had been combined to form Congo-Ubangi District, the northern part of Coquilhatville Province. Coquilhatville Province was renamed √âquateur Province in 1947. There were further changes to boundaries. A 1955-1957 map shows Ubangi District bounded by French territory to the west and north, Mongala District to the east and √âquateur District to the south. Ubangi district roughly corresponded to the present Sud-Ubangi province and the western part of Nord-Ubangi province. The area was out of a total of for Equateur province as a whole. Post-Independance On 14 August 1962 Cuvette Centrale Province and Ubangi Province were separated from √âquateur Province, and on 5 February 1963 the remainder became Moyen-Congo Province. These three provinces were combined into a new √âquateur Province on 25 April 1966. On 11 July 2015 √âquateur was split into the present provinces of √âquateur, Mongala, Nord-Ubangi, Sud-Ubangi and Tshuapa.. The former Ubangi District is divided between Nord-Ubangi and Sud-Ubangi, which also contain part of the former Bangala District.

History The People's Commissariat of Justice was established by the Decree Establishing the Council of People's Commissars, passed by the Second All‚ÄìRussian Congress of Soviets of Workers', Soldiers' and Peasants' Deputies on October 27, 1917. In 1917, the People's Commissariat of Justice was entrusted with the immediate breakdown of the entire apparatus of the former Ministry of Justice and the Court of the Russian Empire. The People's Commissariat of Justice was entrusted with the responsibility of building a new legal system and a new justice system, as well as replacing the abolished Governing Senate in terms of judicial control on a nationwide scale. At the same time, the duties of the State Council of the Russian Empire, its Special Department and the Senate for the preparation and publication of decrees and for the codification of laws passed to the People's Commissariat of Justice. In the Soviet Union, in accordance with the Constitution until 1936, only the republican People's Commissariats of Justice operated: the People's Commissariat of Justice of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic and the People's Commissariats of Justice of the Union and Autonomous Republics supervised the judicial practice of all judicial bodies of this republic, challenging and directing the supervision through the prosecutor's office wrong sentence or decision made by any court on the territory of the republic. In the organizational field, the People's Commissariats of Justice of the Union and Autonomous Republics were entrusted with: general management, organization, audit, and instruction of all judicial institutions of the republic, notaries, bailiffs, defense, organized under the People's Commissariats of Justice, bureaus of accounting expertise and educational institutions under the jurisdiction of the People's Commissariats of Justice of the union republics. Supervision of judicial policy in specific cases was carried out by the supreme courts of the union republics, regional, regional courts of ownership and the prosecutor's office. According to the Constitution of the Soviet Union of 1936, the Union‚ÄìRepublican People's Commissariat of Justice of the Soviet Union was created. Thus, the People's Commissariat of Justice of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic and the People's Commissariats of Justice of other union republics, being part of the republican Councils of People's Commissars, at the same time had to carry out the orders of the unified central union People's Commissariat of Justice of the Soviet Union. In 1946, the People's Commissariat of Justice of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was transformed into the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.On the Transformation of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union into the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the Councils of People's Commissars of the Union and Autonomous Republics ‚Äì Into the Councils of Ministers of the Union and Autonomous Republics // Bulletin of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, 1946, No. 10 Functions of the People's Commissariat The People's Commissariat of Justice was entrusted with the following tasks: #Organization and instructing the bodies of the court, investigation, defense (advocacy) and prosecution (prosecutor's office), as well as monitoring the activities of the commission on juvenile affairs; #Consideration, in the order of the highest judicial review, court decisions and sentences that have entered into legal force, the provision of guidance and instructions to the judicial authorities and supervision of legality (the People's Commissar is simultaneously the Prosecutor of the Republic); #Preliminary consideration of bills, publication, and interpretation of laws; #Development of general penalties, organization of a corrective labor regime for persons deprived of their liberty both by court verdicts and by way of a preliminary investigation, as well as managing places of deprivation of liberty; #Leading and supervising the implementation of the separation of the church from the state (a liquidation department was created in the People's Commissariat that was engaged in the destruction of the Russian Orthodox Church). Execution of punishments On April 15, 1919, the decree \\"On Forced Labor Camps\\" was issued in the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. From the very beginning of the existence of Soviet power, the management of most places of detention was entrusted to the department for the execution of punishments of the People's Commissariat of Justice of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, formed in May 1918. Heads of the People's Commissariat On November 8, 1917, Georgy Oppokov was appointed People's Commissar of Justice, he was replaced by Pyotr Stuchka, then Isaac Steinberg. On June 16, 1918, Pyotr Stuchka was appointed People's Commissar of Justice. In August 1918, after the departure of Peter Stuchka (who headed the Soviet government of Latvia from the end of 1918), Dmitry Kursky was appointed People's Commissar of Justice, who held this post until 1928. The next People's Commissar was Nikolai Yanson, who was replaced in 1931 by Nikolay Krylenko, who held the post until July 1936. The People's Commissar of Justice of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic was at the same time the Prosecutor of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic. The Supreme Court of the Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic, like the prosecutor's office, was part of the apparatus of the People's Commissariat of Justice, and the chairman of the Supreme Court was simultaneously the Deputy People's Commissar of Justice. This management model coincided with the pre- Soviet model and existed until 1936. Structure of the People's Commissariat Structure in 1917. The operational meeting, the secretariat, and the group of responsible executors were directly subordinate to the People's Commissar. The People's Commissariat included: *Management of Affairs; *Personnel Training Department; *Legislative and Codification Department; *Financial Department; *Special Department; *Secret Encryption Part. In total, the staff was 150 people.

It was fought between the armies of the Alaouite Sultan Ismail Ibn Sharif and those of the dey of Algiers Hadj Moustapha. It took place in the context of an attempt by the Alaouites to conquer the west of the Regency of Algiers, coordinated with an offensive by Tunis on the east of the Regency of Algiers in the 1700s and 1701s.  Background  As early as the 1690s, a change of course was made in the foreign policy of the Regency of Algiers by the dey Hadj Chaabane; the latter diverted Algiers from the wars of sea racing against the Europeans and sought to federate the entire Maghreb under his authority. His policy was pursued by the dey Moustapha who confronted the joint armies of Tunis and Tripoli in October 1700 before facing the Cherifian Empire of Moulay Isma√´l. Moroccan troops entered the war against the Algerians during the Hegirian year 1111 (1699-1700). This time, this attempt was coordinated with an offensive by the Bey of Tunis on the province of Constantine. An initial campaign was led by Ismail Ibn Sharif's son Ze√Ødan, who had some success: he took Tlemcen and drove the Turks from Algiers out of the city, then Mascara, where he even pillaged the bey's palace. However, to save his booty he concluded a truce with Algiers and returned to Morocco. Sultan Ismail Ibn Sharif is furious about this peace because it allows the Regency of Algiers to concentrate on its eastern front and to defeat the army of Tunis between Setif and Constantine. Ismail Ibn Sharif dismissed his son Zidan from his command and returned to campaign against Algiers. He then advanced as far as the Chelif valley. The dey Hadj Moustapha, victorious in the east, gathers troops of tribal auxiliaries on his way to face up to it. The meeting of the two armies takes place in the valley of Chelif, more precisely on the banks of a tributary, the Djidouia.  Battle  The battle took place on 28 April 1701 and the engagement of the two armies began at noon. In the face of the 20,000 men of Ismail ben Cherif, Dey Hadj Mustapha had 10,000 regulars and tribal troops, including Kabyle Igawawen auxiliaries, whose number is not specified. The battle ended around 4 p.m. with a rout of Ismail Ibn Sharif. The latter, wounded in the fighting, had to escape on horseback and narrowly escaped capture. This battle put an end to Ismail Ibn Sharif's Algerian campaign and, temporarily, to his territorial aims.  Consequences  An anonymous Algerian wrote on May 2 to a French correspondent, sending him a copy of Dey Mustapha's letter to his khodja dated 18 April 1701 in the camp. These Letters from Algiers recount the \\"great advantage that the Algerians gained over the King of Morocco\\" by tackling the victory of the wadi Djidiouia where Moulay Ismail lost 3000 men, including 50 kings. The Algerian-Moroccan war of 1701 initiated an unexpected and ephemeral rapprochement between the regency of Algiers and Spain.

Early life The Ashton family owned mills in Hyde, Godley and Gerrards Wood which employed many hundreds of people. They were among the earliest cotton pioneers in Hyde. From 1800 they worked as a family business with mills at Gerrards Wood and Wilson Brook at Godley. Six brothers were involved in the business which, as well as coal and cotton, also established the calico printing works at Newton Bank. In 1823 the brothers separated, Samuel and Thomas taking the major shares; the former establishing himself at Apethorn Mill and soon after building Woodley Mill, while Thomas ran the factory at the Hollow. The Ashtons were particularly noted for running mills that did both spinning and weaving, a successful practice when most mills concentrated on one process. Together with his wife Elizabeth Ashton n√©e Gair, Thomas had 7 children; Harriet G. Ashton, Elizabeth M. Ashton, Katharine Ashton, Grace Mary Ashton, Charlotte Jane Ashton,Thomas Gair Ashton and William Mark Ashton. Thomas Gair Ashton later became the first 1st Baron Ashton of Hyde, an industrialist and politician. Career Thomas had inherited the cotton mills and the merchants' business in Manchester, 1845, and maintained the expansion programme initiated by his father, making the Flowery Fields mills complex the largest industrial concern in the district. The mills were considered to be 'The best of their class in the country, thoroughly equipped and conducted with every regard for the comfort and welfare of the operatives' (Bedford, Ashtons of Hyde). Not only did Thomas carry on the Ashton family tradition he had inherited as an employer‚Äîthat of an employer who realised his responsibilities to the men and women who worked for him‚Äîhe improved on it. He enlarged the mill school, built a church at Flowery Fields, and expanded the village built by his father; he also established scholarships at the Hyde Mechanics' Institute and the technical school which enabled students to go to Owens College and to the Manchester Mechanics Institute. Care of his employees had always been an important factor to him, and during the cotton famine, when many mills were closed and most employers ruined, Thomas Ashton made sure that his mills never stopped. In spite of immense personal and financial loss, he kept his workforce in full employment by setting them to work in his brickworks and building Throstle Bank Mill. Following his move to Ford Bank in Didsbury, Ashton maintained his strong links with the town of Hyde. He took a very active part in local politics, and succeeded in obtaining the charter of incorporation in 1881 for Hyde. He was one of the first radicals elected to Hyde town council, and at the first meeting of the new authority, he was elected as alderman and also first mayor of Hyde in recognition of his work. He funded many projects and was also an active member of the Manchester branch of the National Educational League, which did much to prepare the way for the passing of the 1870 act. His work on the Hyde Relief Committee was one of the reasons that the city council gave him the freedom of the city in 1892. As well as his many activities in Hyde and Manchester, Ashton served as High Sheriff of Lancashire and also as a magistrate for Cheshire and Lancashire. He was a leading member of the Liberal Party in Manchester. In 1882 he declined a baronetcy offered to him by William Gladstone, who became a close friend and who stayed at his Ford Bank home when he came to Manchester. Death and legacy Thomas Ashton died at Ford Bank, Didsbury, on 21 January 1898, and was buried at Hyde Chapel three days later. He is to be remembered as a man who gave his life to the service of high principles and to beneficent labours in his native town of Hyde and his larger home of the city of Manchester. Due to the nature of his work, in particular his concern for his work force during the cotton famine, Professor Neil Bourne and Professor Andrew Curran decided to use his name when creating the Thomas Ashton Institute for Risk and Regulation at the University of Manchester. Thomas Ashton Institute for Risk and Regulation The Thomas Ashton Institute is a collaborative partnership between the Health and Safety Executive(HSE) and The University of Manchester.

It came to operate on the Teruel, Levante and Central fronts.  History = Front of Teruel  The unit was created in March 1937, on the Teruel front, from the militarization of the Iron Column. The 83rd MB was integrated into the 41st Division, along with other recently militarized forces. Joaqu√≠n Garc√≠a-Morato Ruiz was appointed as head of the brigade. It went on to publish its own newspaper, the \\"Columna de Hierro\\", printed in Vinaroz. In July the 83rd MB was sent to the Albarrac√≠n sector as reinforcement against the nationalist counteroffensive that followed the Battle of Albarrac√≠n. After its arrival in the area, it came to replace the Republican 42nd Division, which was left very broken after the nationalist attacks. At the beginning of August, the brigade was placed in the 64th Division of the 19th Army Corps. During the following days it had to resist the enemy counterattacks, which began on August 4 and lasted until August 21, managing to maintain its positions. At the end of 1937 the unit, which was still attached to the 64th Division, participated in the Battle of Teruel. On December 16, it participated in the capture of , subsequently remaining as a support unit. On December 30 the nationalists launched a counteroffensive that sought to lift the siege of Teruel, attacking in the Campillo sector. The 81st Mixed Brigade fell back under enemy pressure, losing Campilo and causing a breach in the front that would also drag the 83rd MB into its retreat. After the republican conquest of the Teruel capital, the unit was located on the left flank of the front, where it saw no outstanding activity.  Fighting in Levante  At the end of the military operations in Teruel, the 83rd MB was again added to the 41st Division. In mid-April 1938, after the republican zone was cut in two, the unit was added to the Extremadura Division and destined for the coastal sector; attacked by the forces of Rafael Garc√≠a Vali√±o, the 83rd MB suffered severe attrition and on May 11 it had to be relieved by elements of the 14th Division. The following day the brigade fought in the Alboc√°cer-Les Coves de Vinrom√† sector. In the La Iglesuela del Cid sector, the unit suffered severe damage from enemy attacks, having to give ground; by May 29 it was positioned in the Ar√©s del Maestre-La Llama sector. A day later, after giving ground and facing the danger of being surrounded, the 83rd MB withdrew together with the entire division towards Alboc√°cer, and then towards Castell√≥n de la Plana. On June 10, the 83rd MB was covering part of the right flank of Castell√≥n de la Plana, although on June 13 it had to face an enemy attack on the heights of \\"Choquera\\"; the brigade launched several counterattacks in the Borriol mountain range, although the assaults it was subjected to finally forced it to withdraw towards the capital of Castell√≥n. After the fall of this city, the unit was withdrawn to the rear to undergo a reorganization.  End of the war  After the end of the fighting in Levante, the unit was assigned to the 73rd Division, remaining as a general reserve of the Central Region Army Group (GERC). On March 8, 1939, under the rule of the National Defence Council, the 83rd MB was sent to Madrid in support of the Casadista forces, where it collaborated in the assault on the Jaca Position. Later it advanced on the urban center of Madrid, in support of the forces of Armando √Ålvarez √Ålvarez.

During World War II, she operated as the mother ship for a midget submarine during the attack on Pearl Harbor and the attack of Diego-Suarez, conducted war patrols in the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean, and served in the Guadalcanal campaign and New Guinea campaign. She was last heard from on 31 August 1943. Design and description The Type C submarines were derived from the earlier KD6 sub-class of the with a heavier torpedo armament for long-range attacks. They displaced surfaced and submerged. The submarines were long, had a beam of and a draft of . They had a diving depth of .Bagnasco, p. 192 For surface running, the boats were powered by two diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater.Chesneau, p. 201 On the surface, the C1s had a range of at ; submerged, they had a range of at . The boats were armed with eight internal bow torpedo tubes and carried a total of 20 torpedoes. They were also armed with a single /40 deck gun and two single or twin mounts for Type 96 anti- aircraft guns. They were equipped to carry one Type A midget submarine aft of the conning tower.Carpenter & Dorr, p. 104 Construction and commissioning Ordered under the 3rd Naval Armaments Supplement Programme and built by Mitsubishi at Kobe, Japan, I-20 was laid down on 16 November 1937 with the name Submarine No. 46. Renamed I-20 by the time she was launched on 25 January 1939, she was completed and commissioned on 26 September 1940. Service history=Pre-World War II Upon commissioning, I-20 was attached to the Yokosuka Naval District. During the autumn of 1940, she took part in Japanese tests of the German-made Atlas Werke Periphon A passive sonar. She was assigned to Submarine Division 2 in Submarine Squadron 1 in the 6th Fleet along with the submarines and . In the autumn of 1941, she underwent conversion into a mother ship for a Type A midget submarine. The submarines , , , and also underwent the conversion. At the Kure Navy Club in Kure, Japan, on 17 November 1941, the commander of Submarine Division 3 briefed the commanding officers of the five converted submarines on the upcoming attack on Pearl Harbor and on the role of their submarines in it. He had been designated the commander of the Special Attack Unit, made up of all five submarines, each of which was to launch a Type A midget submarine off Pearl Harbor so that the midget submarines could participate in the attack. I-22 was to serve as flagship of the Special Attack unit. On 18 November 1941, the five submarines moved from Kure to the Kamegakubi Naval Proving Ground, where each embarked a Type A midget submarine. At 02:15 on 19 November 1941, the five submarines got underway from Kamegakubi bound for the Hawaiian Islands, taking a direct route that took them south of Midway Atoll. While at sea, they received the message \\"Climb Mount Niitaka 1208\\" () from the Combined Fleet on 2 December 1941, indicating that war with the Allies would commence on 8 December 1941 Japan time, which was on 7 December 1941 on the other side of the International Date Line in Hawaii. World War IIPearl Harbor= At 02:57 on 7 December 1941, I-20 launched her midget submarine, No. 17, south of Oahu from the entrance to Pearl Harbor. After the United States Navy coastal minesweeper reported an unidentified submarine in a submarine exclusion zone off Pearl Harbor, the destroyer began a search for the submarine at 04:08, finding nothing. At 06:30, however, Ward sighted No. 17‚Ä≤s conning tower in the wake of the cargo ship Antares, which was approaching the harbor‚Ä≤s outer gate with a target barge in tow. A PBY Catalina flying boat of Patrol Squadron 14 (VP-14) dropped smoke markers to indicate the midget submarine‚Ä≤s position. Ward opened gunfire on the submarine at 06:45 at a range of only , firing the first shot of World War II by the American armed forces. She closed the range to and hit No. 17‚Ä≤s conning tower with a shell. Ward steamed past the midget submarine and dropped four depth charges as it wallowed in her wake, and the PBY then dropped more depth charges. No. 17 sank outside the harbor‚Ä≤s entrance with the loss of her two-man crew. On 28 August 2002, the Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory deep submergence vehicles Pisces IV and Pisces V found a midget submarine resting almost upright on the bottom in of water off the entrance to Pearl Harbor, prompting speculation among historians and maritime archaeologists that it was I-20‚Ä≤s midget. I-20 and the other four \\"mother\\" submarines proceeded to the planned recovery area for their midget submarines west of Lanai, where they spent the night of 7‚Äì8 December 1941. None of the midget submarines returned. Early on 9 December 1941, I-18, I-20, and I-24 received orders to leave the recovery area. I-20 departed the Hawaiian Islands on 12 December 1941 and arrived at Kwajalein with I-16 on 22 December 1941. =First war patrol= On 4 January 1942, I-20 departed Kwajalein to begin her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the vicinity of Fiji and the Samoan Islands. She surfaced off the harbor at Pago-Pago on Tutuila in American Samoa before dawn on 11 January 1942 and fired twelve rounds from her deck gun at the naval station. Most of her shells missed, and the only casualties were a United States Marine Corps officer and a Samoan Marine Reserve Battalion member who suffered wounds. Moving to Fijian waters, I-20 attacked the Royal New Zealand Navy armed merchant cruiser on 16 January 1942 just after Monowai departed the harbor at Suva. Her torpedoes exploded prematurely at 16:03. Believing that she was attacking a merchant ship, I-20 surfaced from Monowai at 16:08 to attack her with gunfire. Monowai opened a heavy volume of fire with her portside guns. I-20 traded fire with Monowai, claiming a hit on Monowai‚Ä≤s bridge, but submerged at 16:14 after Monowai straddled her. Neither vessel suffered damage, and Monowai transmitted a submarine contact signal and steamed out of the area at high speed. I-20 returned to Kwajalein on 24 January 1942, then proceeded to Japan, where she arrived at Yokosuka on 1 February 1942. =February‚ÄìApril 1942= During I-20‚Ä≤s stay in Japan, the German naval staff in Berlin formally requested on 27 March 1942 that Japan begin attacks on Allied convoys in the Indian Ocean. On 8 April 1942, the Japanese formally agreed to meet this request by dispatching submarines to operate off the coast of East Africa, and that day they withdrew Submarine Division 1 of Submarine Squadron 8 from its base at Kwajalein to Japan. By 16 April 1942 they had created the \\"A\\" detachment within Submarine Squadron 8, consisting of I-20 and the submarines , I-16, I-18, and , as well as midget submarines and the auxiliary cruisers and , which were to operate as supply ships for the submarines. That morning, the commander of the 6th Fleet, Vice Admiral Teruhisa Komatsu, the commander of Submarine Squadron 8, their staffs, and the midget submarine crews paid a courtesy call on the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, aboard his flagship, the battleship , at Hashirajima anchorage. After the visit with Yamamoto, the detachment got underway at 11:00, bound for Penang in Japanese-occupied British Malaya. During the detachment‚Ä≤s voyage, 16 United States Army Air Forces B-25 Mitchell bombers launched by the aircraft carrier struck targets on Honshu in the Doolittle Raid on 18 April 1942. The detachment received orders from the 6th Fleet that day to divert from its voyage and head northeast, passing north of the Bonin Islands, to intercept the U.S. Navy task force that had launched the strike. The detachment failed to find the U.S. ships and soon resumed its voyage. I-30 and Aikoku Maru called at Penang from 20 April to 22 April 1942 before heading into the Indian Ocean to conduct an advance reconnaissance of the \\"A\\" Detachment‚Ä≤s planned operating area. The rest of the \\"A\\" Detachment reached Penang on 27 April 1942, where the seaplane carrier ‚Äî which had undergone modifications allowing her to carry Type A midget submarines ‚Äî rendezvoused with it. I-16, I-18, and I-20 each embarked a midget submarine at Penang. =Indian Ocean operation= I-20 and the other \\"A\\" detachment units got underway from Penang on 30 April 1942, headed westward into the Indian Ocean with I-10 serving as the detachment‚Ä≤s flagship. The submarines refueled at sea from Aikoku Maru and H≈çkoku Maru on 5, 10, and 15 May 1942. I-20 suffered a mishap on 17 May when seawater entered through her main induction valve and flooded her engine room in heavy seas. Her crew repaired the damage, only to have the engine room flood a second time, necessitating further repairs. I-10‚Ä≤s Yokosuka E14Y1 (Allied reporting name \\"Glen\\") floatplane began reconnaissance flights over ports in South Africa by reconnoitering Durban on 20 May 1942, followed by flights over East London, Port Elizabeth, and Simon's Town over the next week, and by 24 May the \\"A\\" detachment submarines were encountering heavy Allied shipping traffic as they approached East Africa. On the night of 29 May, I-10‚Ä≤s floatplane flew over Diego-Suarez, Madagascar, sighting the British battleship among the ships anchored there. The \\"A\\" detachment commander selected Diego-Suarez as the target for a midget submarine attack, scheduled for 30 May 1942. On 30 May 1942, I-18‚Ä≤s midget submarine suffered engine failure and could not launch, but I-16 and I-20 launched their midget submarines off Diego-Suarez. I-20‚Ä≤s midget torpedoed Ramillies at 20:25. At 21:20, while British corvettes dropped depth charges, I-20‚Ä≤s midget torpedoed and sank the 6,993-ton tanker British Loyalty in shallow water. After the midget ran aground, its two-man crew reached shore and attempted to make their way overland to the designated recovery area, but they were reported to the British as having been seen outside Anjiabe at around 11:00 on 1 June and died in a gunfight with Royal Marine Commando No. 5 on 2 June 1942 at Amponkarana Bay (). One Royal Marine also died in the exchange of gunfire. Ramillies survived the attack and departed for Durban ten days later, although the Japanese assessed her as sunk after I-10‚Ä≤s floatplane noted her missing from Diego-Saurez during a reconnaissance flight. British Loyalty later was refloated, towed to Addu Atoll, and scuttled. On 3 June 1942, after I-16 and I-18 had departed the recovery area, I-20 arrived and made an unsuccessful attempt to contact the midget submarines and their crews. She then joined the rest of the \\"A\\" detachment in anti-shipping operations. She torpedoed and sank the Panamanian 5,086-ton armed merchant ship Johnstown at on 5 June, the Greek 5,209-ton merchant ship Christos Markettos at on 8 June, and the British 7,926-ton armed merchant ship Mahronda at on 11 June 1942. On 12 June, she sank the Panamanian 2,052-ton merchant ship Hellenic Trader at with gunfire and torpedoed and sank the British 5,063-ton merchant ship Clifton Hall at . After refueling from Aikoku Maru on 19 June 1942, I-20 torpedoed the Norwegian 5,063-ton armed merchant ship Goviken, which was on a voyage from Aden to Louren√ßo Marques in Portuguese East Africa, on 29 June 1942. Goviken sank less than 20 minutes later at . On 30 June, I-20 attacked the British 5,311-ton armed steam tanker with gunfire at . She fired fifteen rounds and scored one hit. After Steaua Romana returned fire, I-20 submerged and fired a torpedo, but it exploded prematurely. Steaua Romana dropped a smoke float in attempt to conceal herself and tried to escape, but I-20 fired a second torpedo which sank her. That evening, I-20 was able to identify her victim as Steaua Romana by intercepting Allied radio communications. Concerned by a number of premature detonations of I-20‚Ä≤s torpedoes, her commanding officer ordered her crew to disassemble and examine a Type 95 torpedo on 5 July 1942. On 21 July, she moved into the Gulf of Aden before departing her patrol area and proceeding to Penang, which she reached on 5 August 1942. She later set course for Japan, arriving at Yokosuka on 23 August 1942 to undergo an overhaul. =Guadalcanal campaign= Meanwhile, the Guadalcanal campaign had begun on 7 August 1942 with U.S. amphibious landings on Guadalcanal, Tulagi, Florida Island, Gavutu, and Tanambogo in the southeastern Solomon Islands. With her overhaul complete, I-20 got uderway from Yokosuka on 24 October 1942 to take part in the fighting in the Solomons. On 2 November 1942, I-16, I-20, and I-24 formed an attack group and each received orders to load a midget submarine delivered by the seaplane tender at an anchorage off Shortland Island in the Shortland Islands, then proceed to the Indispensable Strait. I-20 loaded her midget submarine, No. 11, on 5 November. She launched No. 11 north of Cape Esperance on Guadalcanal‚Ä≤s northern coast at 05:20 on 7 November 1942. No. 11 hit the anchored U.S. Navy 2,227-ton miscellaneous auxiliary , with a Type 97 torpedo, inflicting enough damage that Majaba had to beach herself on Guadalcanal to avoid sinking, although she later was salvaged. The destroyers and counterattacked with depth charges, but No. 11 escaped unscathed. No. 11‚Ä≤s crew scuttled her and swam safely to Guadalcanal, and I-20 proceeded to Truk. At Truk, I-20 embarked the midget submarine No. 37 and departed on 13 November 1942. She arrived at her launch area off Lungga Point on the northern coast of Guadalcanal on 18 November, and launched No. 37 off Cape Esperance at 03:00 on 19 November 1942. At 03:02, No. 37 developed a serious oil leak from her steering system, but she pressed ahead on the surface. Sighting no targets off Guadalcanal, her two-man crew scuttled her off Cape Esperance at 09:55 and swam safely to shore on Guadalcanal. At Truk, I-20 embarked the midget submarine No. 8 and departed on 26 November 1942. She arrived at her launch area off Lungga Point on 1 December 1942. She launched No. 8 off Savo Island on 2 December. On 3 December, No. 8 sighted several targets, including transports and destroyers, off Guadalcanal. She ran aground but freed herself, then fired both of her torpedoes at a transport, subsequently hearing an explosion. A destroyer pursued No. 8. She escaped without damage, but was swamped when she surfaced, so her two-man crew scuttled her and swam safely to Guadalcanal. While I-20 was conducting her midget-submarine operations, the Japanese issued orders on 16 November 1942 for their submarines to begin a series of supply runs to deliver cargo to the Japanese forces fighting on Guadalcanal. Assigned to these duties, I-20 arrived off Cape Esperance on 31 December 1942, delivering 25-tons of cargo in rubber containers. She made a brief stop at Truk before departing on 2 January 1943 for Shortland Island. Getting underway from Shortland for her second supply run, she arrived off Cape Esperance on 7 January 1943, discharging 18-tons of cargo in rubber containers. On her third and final Guadalcanal supply run, she became the first Japanese submarine to deliver cargo using an Unkato supply container ‚Äî a submersible cargo container that could carry up to 377 tons of supplies, designed for a one-way trip in which the cargo‚Ä≤s recipients released, recovered, and unloaded it ‚Äî departing Shortland on 20 January and delivering 18 tons of cargo at Cape Esperance in her container on 22 January 1943. =New Guinea campaign= After the conclusion of the Guadalcanal campaign in early February 1943, I-20 received orders to begin supply runs to New Guinea, where Japanese forces were fighting in the New Guinea campaign. Departing Truk on 18 March 1943, she delivered 30 tons of food and ammunition at Lae on the coast of New Guinea on 21 March. She called at Lae again to deliver cargo on 27 March 1943. During her third supply run, she collided underwater with her sister ship I-16 south of New Britain on 2 April 1943, but suffered only minor damage and continued to Lae, which she reached on 3 April. She unloaded 37 tons of cargo there and evacuated 39 men, including Imperial Japanese Army Lieutenant General Hataz≈ç Adachi and his staff. She next called at Lae on 9 April 1943, dropping off 30 tons of cargo and embarking 42 soldiers. On 11 April 1943, the submarine , also making a supply run to Lae, was on the surface in the Solomon Sea east of Gasmata, New Britain, when she sighted I-20 on the surface at 05:10. Sighting I-5 at 05:13 and mistaking her for an Allied submarine, I-20 began an attack approach. I-5, which had identified I-20 as a Japanese submarine, managed to break contact with I-20, which had never realized during the encounter that I-5 was Japanese. I-5, , I-16, and I-20 were attached temporarily to the headquarters of the 8th Fleet on 13 April 1942. I-20 delivered 37 tons of cargo at Lae on 15 April 1943 and embarked 42 soldiers. An Allied bomber illuminated her with flares off Lae, but she avoided an attack. I-20‚Ä≤s next supply run was to Kolombangara in the New Georgia Islands, where she delivered food and ammunition on 20 April 1943. She then returned to her Lae runs, calling there on 2 May 1943 to deliver 39 tons of cargo and evacuate 31 soldiers and on 8 May to deliver another 39 tons of cargo on her seventh and final supply run to Lae. Re-attached to 8th Fleet headquarters on 15 May 1943, she proceeded to Japan, where she arrived on 20 May at Yokosuka for an overhaul. =Second war patrol= With her overhaul complete and reassigned to Submarine Squadron 1, I-20 departed Yokosuka on 4 August 1943 and stopped at Truk from 10 to 19 August before getting back underway to conduct her second war patrol, assigned a patrol area in the New Hebrides. On 30 August 1943, she reported sighting an Allied force including an aircraft carrier and two battleships off Espiritu Santo. On 31 August, she reported that she had torpedoed and damaged the American 10,872-ton tanker W. S. Rheem at . She was never heard from again. =Loss= The exact circumstances of I-20‚Ä≤s loss remain unknown. I-20 and the submarine both were patrolling in the vicinity of the New Hebrides at the time, and neither returned. U.S. Navy forces reported two successful antisubmarine attacks off Espiritu Santo in early September 1943. The first action took place on 1 September 1943, when the destroyer , operating as part of a hunter-killer group, began a search for a reported Japanese submarine off Espiritu Santo at 10:55. After searching on a north-south axis, she picked up a strong sonar contact at 13:00, and dropped a pattern of ten depth charges set to explode at an average depth of . The attack produced no signs of success, so Wadsworth commenced a second attack, with her depth charges set for an average of . The submarine turned to port just before Wadsworth launched the depth charges, then headed south before turning northeast, creating an underwater wake that degraded Wadsworth‚Ä≤s sonar detection capability. Wadsworth made several attack runs without dropping depth charges before firing a deep pattern set to explode at an average depth of . This resulted in a very large air bubble rising to the surface, but no other sign of a submarine in distress. Wadsworth continued to pursue the submarine, which maneuvered to create more underwater turbulence in an attempt to defeat Wadsworth‚Ä≤s sonar. Wadsworth dropped a final pattern of ten depth charges set to explode at an average depth of , then turned east and opened the range. A PBY Catalina flying boat reported debris and a oil slick that smelled like diesel fuel on the surface just south of the location of Wadsworth‚Ä≤s final attack. Wooden debris also was sighted on the surface at . The second action occurred on 3 September 1943, when the destroyer conducted a sweep for a reported Japanese submarine off Espiritu Santo. Ellet picked up a radar contact at a range of at 19:35, closed to a range of about , and challenged the unseen contact with a visual signal. After Ellet received no reply, she illuminated the area with star shells. The target disappeared from radar at a range of , but Ellet then picked up a sonar contact at a range of . Between 20:12 and 20:38 Ellet conducted a series of depth charge attacks. She lost sonar contact at 20:59, and at dawn on 4 September 1943 a large oil slick and debris were sighted on the surface at . The submarines Wadsworth and Ellet sank remain unidentified. It seems likely that one of them was I-20 and the other I-182. On 18 November 1943, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared I-20 lost with her entire crew of 101 men off Espiritu Santo. She was stricken from the Navy list on 1 December 1943.

The battle was the final major conflict of the Mercenary War and resulted in a decisive victory for the Carthaginians. In 241 BC 20,000 foreign troops who had been employed by Carthage during the First Punic War (264 to 241 BC) mutinied under the leadership of Spendius and Matho starting the Mercenary War. They were supported by an uprising of Carthage's oppressed African territories and 70,000 local recruits flocked to join them, bringing supplies and finance. War-weary Carthage fared poorly in the initial engagements of the war, especially under the leadership of Hanno. Hamilcar Barca was given supreme command in 239 BC and slowly turned the tide. In 238 BC Matho and the remnants of the rebel army left the area around Carthage and marched south to the wealthy port city of Leptis Parva. Hanno reconciled with Hamilcar and with a larger Carthaginian army they pursued the rebels, harrying their march. After three months of manoeuvres, in which the rebels consistently came off worst, battle was given and the rebels were completely defeated. The remaining rebellious cities rapidly surrendered or were captured by the Carthaginians, ending the war.  Background  In 241 BC 20,000 foreign troops who had been employed by Carthage in the fighting on Sicily during the First Punic War (264 to 241 BC) were recalled to the Carthaginian homeland in North Africa (in what is now Tunisia) to be paid and despatched home. A dispute over the payment of wages owed developed and late in the year the troops mutinied under the leadership of Spendius and Matho starting the Mercenary War. They were supported by an uprising of Carthage's oppressed dependent territories and 70,000 Africans flocked to join them, bringing supplies and finance. War-weary Carthage fared poorly in the initial engagements of the war, especially under the generalship of Hanno, and was under blockade for most of the war. At some point during 240 BC the Carthaginians raised another, smaller, force, which was placed under the command of Hamilcar Barca, who had commanded the Carthaginian forces on Sicily for the last six years of the First Punic War. After a significant victory over a rebel army led by Spendius at the Battle of the Bagradas River Hamilcar was given joint command of the army. Hamilcar and Hanno were political opponents and had different approaches to fighting the war, so there was no military cooperation between them. Hamilcar campaigned successfully, initially demonstrating leniency in an attempt to woo the rebels over. To ensure a great hatred between the armies, and so prevent their men being tempted to desert to the Carthaginians, in 240 BC Spendius tortured 700 Carthaginian prisoners to death, and henceforth the war was pursued with great brutality. Hamilcar was given supreme command in 239 BC. Meanwhile, the rebels under Matho had blockaded the Carthaginian-supporting cities of Utica and Hippo (modern Bizerte) and put an army under Spendius into the field. Eventually the rebel field army was destroyed and Spendius captured and crucified. Despite the inhabitants of Utica and Hippo slaughtering their Carthaginian garrisons and going over to the rebels in 239 BC, the following year Matho and his army left the area around Carthage and marched south to the wealthy port city of Leptis Parva (just south of the modern city of Monastir, Tunisia). This was the capital of the prosperous Byzacium region and had risen against Carthage earlier in the war. The historian Dexter Hoyos speculates that the rebels may have been hoping to leave the area by sea.  Battle  The Carthaginian Senate encouraged reconciliation between Hanno and Hamilcar, and they agreed to serve together. The pair marched after the rebels with an army totalling perhaps 25,000 including every Carthaginian citizen of military age. On this occasion Hanno and Hamilcar cooperated well together and harassed the rebels on their march. The rebels were forced into a succession of unsuccessful skirmishes in Byzacium as the Carthaginians attempted to wear them down. Matho, rather than wait to be besieged, decided to meet the Carthaginians in open battle in mid- to late 238 BC. As the rebels were by now in extremis Matho called in every available man, stripping all rebel-held towns of garrisons. As the rebels' situation had worsened, they had increasingly suffered from desertions. Few of the original mutineers remained, after the previous three years of fierce campaigning, to participate in this battle; most of the rebel army was made up of indigenous North Africans. The Carthaginian army on the other hand, was steadily reinforced and had grown to over 30,000 men and a large number of war elephants. Battle was given eight to ten weeks after the two armies arrived in Byzacium, although the location is not known. Few details of the battle survive. It was a set piece battle, with no subtleties of manoeuvreMatho was not a proficient general and the Carthaginians were so superior that they felt no need for stratagems. Hamilcar was the senior Carthaginian commander and he ensured that the rebels were crushed, with few losses to the Carthaginians. In a change of policy, prisoners were taken, which probably helped to ensure that there was no desperate last stand. Captives were sold into slavery. Matho was also captured, and he was dragged through the streets of Carthage and tortured to death by its inhabitants.  Aftermath Most of the towns and cities which had not already come to terms with Carthage now did so, with the exceptions of Utica and Hippo, whose inhabitants feared vengeance for their massacre of Carthaginians. They attempted to hold out, but Polybius says that they too \\"quickly\\" surrendered, probably in late 238 or very early 237 BC. The towns and cities that surrendered were treated leniently, although Carthaginian governors were imposed on them. Immediately after the war Hamilcar led many of his veterans on an expedition to expand Carthaginian holdings in southern Iberia; this was to become a semi-autonomous Barcid fiefdom. In 218 BC a Carthaginian army under Hannibal Barca besieged the Roman-protected town of Saguntum in eastern Iberia, providing the spark which ignited the Second Punic War.

It is a Grade II listed building. History The municipal offices facing the Town Hall The building was commissioned to replace the 18th century guildhall in the High Street. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by the mayor, Daniel Clarke, on 5 November 1903. The building was designed by Charles Bateman and Alfred Hale in the Queen Anne style and was officially opened on 12 October 1904. The design involved seven bays with a central doorway flanked by Ionic order columns and segmented windows in the bays. The design for the first floor involved tall windows, while the attic storey had round windows at either end. On the roof was a clock turret with cupola above. Internally, the principal room on the first floor was the Oak Room, which was heavily panelled and featured stained glass windows depicting local people: the philosopher, Edmund Burke, the former Prime Minister, Benjamin Disraeli, the English Civil War Parliamentarian, John Hampden, and the founder of Pennsylvania, William Penn. Additional accommodation in the form of municipal offices, designed by R G Brocklehurst and Charles Cowles-Voysey in the neo-Georgian style, were built on the opposite side of Queen Victoria Road in 1931. The architects were awarded a bronze medal by the Royal Institute of British Architects for the design of the municipal offices. The town hall was used as an events venue rather than for civic affairs and performers included the rock band, The Rolling Stones, in 1963 and the rock band, The Who, in 1965. Council meetings of the municipal borough of High Wycombe were still held in the guildhall into the late 1920s and it was not until the early 1930s that council meetings moved to the council chamber in the municipal offices. After the municipal borough was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, the successor body, Wycombe District Council, continued to make use of the council chamber in the municipal offices and that building was restyled \\"the District Council Offices\\". The town hall became surplus to requirements and was subsequently absorbed into the Wycombe Swan entertainment complex.

To date, they have released four studio albums, two demos and one EP, and are now notable for being part of the thrash metal revival movement in the late 2000s. Influenced by the new wave of British heavy metal and Bay Area thrash metal scenes of the 1980s, Hatchet's music has been variously described by critics as thrash metal, crossover thrash and punk rock. History Hatchet was formed in January 2005, and recorded their first demo Frailty of the Flesh the following year. Following this was their second demo, simply titled Frailty Demo, and a self-titled EP, both released in 2007. These releases as well as an appearance on the Thrash Metal Warriors compilation and high-profile shows in the Bay Area (such as opening for a reunited Possessed) attracted the attention of Metal Blade Records, who released the band's debut album Awaiting Evil in May 2008. Awaiting Evil received positive reviews from the music press, and several months after its release the band went on hiatus. By early 2009, however, Ramos reformed Hatchet with a new lineup featuring himself and Sterling Bailey on guitar, Eric Lundgren on vocals, Ryan King on bass and Alex Perez on drums, and following this, the band embarked on a US tour with Havok. It took five years, more member changes and a switch to record labels (from Metal Blade to The End), until the release of their second album Dawn of the End in March 2013. The album got good reviews, and Hatchet toured relentlessly in support of it, reportedly playing over 200 shows with the likes of Soilwork, the Jeff Loomis Band, Blackguard, Trivium, Flotsam and Jetsam, Exmortus, Warbringer, Havok, Lich King, Black Tide, Cellador and Threat Signal. The success of Dawn of the Dead also resulted in Hatchet shooting their first-ever music video \\"Signals of Infection\\". Hatchet's third album, Fear Beyond Lunacy, was released on October 30, 2015, and was their first and only release with the new lineup of Ramos, Clayton Cagle on guitar, Kody Barba on bass, and Ben Smith on drums. Fear Beyond Lunacy was well-received by the music press, with Blabbermouth.net describing it as \\"a well-performed replication of classic San Fran thrash, reminiscent of Testament, Death Angel, Heathen and Exodus along with L.A.'s Agent Steel.\\" In promotion of Fear Beyond Lunacy, music videos were shot for \\"In Fear We Trust\\" and \\"Tearing Into Hell\\", and Hatchet toured for nearly two years in support of the album, sharing the stage with the likes of Metal Church, Flotsam and Jetsam, Helstar, Act of Defiance, Eliminate, Black Fast and Green Death. Fear Beyond Lunacy would also be Hatchet's final album before they switched record labels from The End to Combat Records. Hatchet's fourth album and Combat debut, Dying to Exist, was released on June 22, 2018, and has been described by critics as the band's \\"heaviest and most focused release to date.\\" This was also Hatchet's first album to chart in the US, peaking at number 23 on Billboards Top Heatseekers chart, and the band released three videos in order to promote the album: \\"Desire for Oppression\\", \\"Silent Genocide\\" and \\"Back Into Dust\\". Hatchet toured non-stop in support of Dying to Exist, playing with bands like Kataklysm, Exhorder, Exmortus, The Absence, Krisiun, Novareign, Immortal Guardian, Black Fast and Micawber.

In general, primary cell cultures are considered more representative of in vivo tissues than cell lines, and this is recognized legally in some countries such as the UK (Human Tissue Act 2004). However, primary cells require adequate substrate and nutrient conditions to thrive and after a certain number of divisions they acquire a senescent phenotype, leading to irreversible cell cycle arrest. The generation of cell lines stems from these two reasons. Primary cells can become immortalized either spontaneously (e.g. HeLa cells) or by genetic modification (e.g. HEK cells), at which point they become cell lines which can be subculutred indefinitely. Because of their requirements for viability, primary cell cultures did not become widespread until the 2000s. These cultures present several advantages over cell lines, including a better representation of the cellular heterogeneity of tissues, a more faithful transcriptomic and proteomic profile (especially when cultured in 3D) and more realistic functional responses, including drug responses. In contrast, immortalized cell lines are known to become homogeneous through the natural selection of specific subpopulations, to undergo genetic drift and to acquire genetic aberrations. In many cases, cell lines have been misidentified, contaminated with other cells or infected with Mycoplasma, small intracellular bacteria that went undetected for decades. When whole or partial tissues are isolated and maintained ex vivo, the procedure is termed primary tissue culture. More specific terms include organotypic culture, tissue slices and explants.

It operated on the Arag√≥n and Extremadura fronts.  History  The unit was created on April 28, 1937, on the Huesca front, from the old Red and Black Column. Command of the brigade fell to M√°ximo Franco Cavero, with Ram√≥n de la Torre Mart√≠n as Chief of Staff and the anarcho-syndicalist Manuel Lozano Guill√©n as political commissioner. It was integrated into the 28th Division, which was the former Ascaso Column. In June it took part in the Huesca Offensive and a few months later it also participated in the Zaragoza Offensive, attacking the town of Zuera ‚Äîwithout success‚Äî. During the Battle of Teruel, while the 125th and 126th mixed brigades participated in the fighting, the 127th MB remained located in Upper Arag√≥n as a reserve force for the Eastern Army. On March 9, 1938, after the start of the nationalist offensive on the Aragon front, the brigade was ordered to march to the threatened sector to try to contain the enemy attack. On March 11, however, the brigade disbanded due to contact with the enemy in the area of Alag√≥n-Oliete. On March 13, it lost the towns of Andorra, Ari√±o and Alloza, having to retreat to the area between Teruel and Escorihuela, where it was located until April 23rd. Its remains ended up being reintegrated into the old division. The 127th Brigade, which suffered a major loss, had to be withdrawn to Calles to undergo a reorganization. In August 1938 it was sent as reinforcement to the Extremadura front, now under the command of the militia major Esteban Serra Colobrans. The brigade intervened in the Republican counterattack that followed the Franco offensive in the Battle of Merida pocket. After crossing the Z√∫jar river, it continued advancing until it was in the vicinity of Castuera. It remained in this sector until it was withdrawn to cover losses suffered.

Biography He was born in Welling, at that time in the London Borough of Bexley. His father, John William Waller, was a veterinary surgeon in the 1st Battalion, the Middlesex Regiment, and was captured by the Japanese at the Fall of Hong Kong in December 1941. Father and son did not meet until after the father's liberation by the Soviet Red Army at the end of World War II. Waller's childhood was disrupted by his parents' divorce and many house moves; he attended nine schools. He left full-time education at 16, and had various jobs. He had always been interested in history, and was inspired as a teenager by three Hollywood historical films: Ivanhoe (1952), Knights of the Round Table (1953) and Quentin Durward (1955), all directed by Richard Thorpe and starring Robert Taylor, which form an unofficial trilogy. He became interested in the Middle Ages; not as book history, but as to how people lived and thought, especially the concept of knightly honour. He began to make replicas of historical weapons and armour, and set out on a lifelong quest to understand how they were used and how effective they were. At the age of 16, he took up archery (preferring field archery over target shooting). In 1960, he met Rosemary Atkinson at Bromley Archery Club, in London. They shared the same interests, and married two years later. Their only son, Jonathan, was born in 1970. In 1963, he was recruited to run the archery department of the specialist sporting goods store Lillywhites in Regent Street, London. The same year, he was a founding member of the Medieval Society, the first of the now-many period-specific historical reenactment societies; specifically, for medieval reenactment. They had several obstacles to overcome: from the disdain of professional historians for the idea of amateur reenactment, through the difficulty of acquiring authentic clothing, armour and weapons when the only suppliers were theatrical costumiers, to working out how to perform dangerous long-forgotten combat skills with low risk of serious injury. So, they made and learned everything themselves, using the historical records; especially, the items on display in the Wallace Collection in London. In 1965, actor Robert Hardy (who had a deep interest in archery) visited Lillywhites, and Waller sold him a longbow and arrows. Through that and other contacts made while working there, Waller discovered an opportunity suited to his interests and skills - fight arranger, action coordinator and historical adviser for stage and screen. His first engagement was in 1965 for a production of the pantomime Babes in the Wood at the London Palladium. During his career, he worked on over 60 plays and 15 operas in London and the English regions, about 50 television dramas, soap operas and documentaries, and many television commercials (including a 28-year association with Strongbow cider and its \\"thudding arrows\\" motif). He worked on more than 10 feature films; including Anne of a Thousand Days (1969), Mary, Queen of Scots (1971), Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), and Legend (1985). He taught actors at, among other institutions, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. His guiding principle was, \\"reality first, theatricality second\\". He strove for historical accuracy; before him, staged sword fighting had been largely based around modern sport fencing techniques. In fantasy settings his question was, \\"If it could have happened, how would it have happened?\\" In 1967, he left Lillywhites to set up his own shop, Bows and Blades, on Tower Hill, facing the main entrance to the Tower of London; it prospered. In 1969, he was a founding member of the Society of British Fight Directors (which later changed its name to the British Academy of Dramatic Combat, and which was later still absorbed into the British Academy of Stage and Screen Combat). He pioneered safer practices in medieval and renaissance combat reenactment. He collaborated with Brigadier Peter Young, founder of The Sealed Knot, a society which specialises in English Civil War reenactment. The modern acceptance of reenactment and living history, based on careful research and experiment, as valid and useful owes much to Waller's and Young's hard work, enthusiasm and skill. The Medieval Society flourished, and in its day gave many displays of martial skills, including archery, foot combat and jousting, at historic venues in the United Kingdom and France. In 1973, Waller invented the balsawood lance, which has the advantages for show combat that it breaks easily (often spectacularly) on impact, and poses less risk to even an armoured human target than one of stouter wood. It was used in a 1974 commercial directed by a young Ridley Scott for the (short-lived) Amazin' Raisin chocolate bar, and has remained popular with reenactors ever since. Waller assisted Hardy during the writing of his authoritative 1976 book Longbow: A Social and Military History (which was used as basis for a BBC TV documentary). This included taking part in the first scientific ballistic trials (at the Royal Armaments Research and Development Establishment) of the English longbow. In 1977, the Royal Armouries (then based only in the Tower of London) had the idea of making a short film, How a Man Schall be Armyd, which would show a knight being equipped with plate armour, mounting a horse and riding off. The armour would be from their own collection, made in the Royal Workshops at Greenwich during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (). They needed someone who could wear armour and ride in it, look natural while doing so, and be trusted with a historical relic. They knew exactly the man to ask, and Waller accepted their invitation; so beginning a long association. The film was shot at Bodiam Castle in Kent, and the Armouries were still showing it. The Tower could only display a small fraction of the Armouries' collection. They had an idea of moving the bulk of the arms and armour collection to a purpose-built facility. That came to fruition in 1996, when, under the direction of Guy Wilson (Master of the Armouries 1988-2002), the Royal Armouries Museum was opened in Leeds. Wilson and Waller had been good friends since before the planning stage, and the new museum incorporated many of Waller's ideas for demonstration areas, where visitors could see craftsmen at work or watch displays of martial prowess. In 1994, after the project has been given the go-ahead, Waller was appointed Head of Interpretation at the Royal Armouries. He recruited and trained the actor demonstrators, and worked with the curators to research and develop scripts and fight sequences. He worked with the Armouries on several short films and also TV documentaries under the general title Arms in Action. In 2000, he founded the European Historical Combat Guild, which studies and practices HEMA. Also in 2000, he organised the first of what became an annual event - a competitive (not demonstration) jousting team tournament held over the Easter weekend in the Museum Tiltyard, for a trophy called the Sword of Honour. He retired in 2007, but maintained a connection as a part-time consultant. He acted as adviser to major archaeological investigations, including the Towton battlefield (1461) in Yorkshire and the Mary Rose, King Henry VIII's flagship, which had sunk in the Solent off the south coast of England in 1545. He was a skilled archer, fighter both unarmed and with one- and two-handed weapons, and horseman. He was an excellent teacher, and also had the patience to train falcons. He was a craftsman in wood, leather and metal. He never learnt to drive; he was not interested. He had a store of unusual knowledge, which he shared freely. He had a fertile and inquiring mind and strong opinions, and expected the highest of standards from both actors and academics. He had a deep love of music, his tastes ranging from English music hall singer Al Bowlly to classical composers of the English Pastoral School, particularly Vaughan Williams. He died in 2018 after a brief illness. He was survived by his wife and his son; who since 1993 has taught stage combat (including, like his father, at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama and the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art), has been a combat advisor for stage and screen, and has worked with the Royal Armouries and the Mary Rose Trust.

The bacteria can infect humans and some other animals, causing persistent open wounds called Buruli ulcer. M. ulcerans is closely related to Mycobacterium marinum, from which it evolved around one million years ago. Description M. ulcerans are rod-shaped bacteria. They appear purple (\\"Gram positive\\") under Gram stain and bright red (\\"acid fast\\") under Ziehl‚ÄìNeelsen stain. On laboratory media, M. ulcerans grow slowly, forming small transparent colonies after four weeks. As colonies age, they develop irregular outlines and a rough, yellow surface. Taxonomy and evolution M. ulcerans is a species of mycobacteria within the phylum Actinobacteria. Within the genus Mycobacteria, M. ulcerans is classified as both a \\"non-tuberculous mycobacterium\\" and a \\"slow-growing mycobacterium\\". M. ulcerans likely evolved from the closely related aquatic pathogen Mycobacterium marinum around one million years ago. The two species are genetically very similar, and have identical 16S ribosomal RNA genes. However relative to M. marinum, M. ulcerans has undergone substantial genome reduction, shedding over a thousand kilobases of genetic content including nearly 1300 genes (23% of the total M. marinum genes) and sustaining the inactivation of an additional 700 genes. Some of these genes were inactivated by the proliferation of two mobile genetic elements, called \\"IS2404\\" (213 copies) and \\"IS2606\\" (91 copies), neither of which are present in M. marinum. Additionally, M. ulcerans has acquired a 174 kilobase plasmid, termed \\"pMUM001\\", which is involved in the production of the toxin mycolactone. Other closely related mycobacteria produce mycolactone and infect various aquatic animals; these are sometimes described as distinct species (M. pseudoshottsii, M. liflandii, M. shinshuense and sometimes M. marinum) and sometimes as different lineages of M. ulcerans. Regardless, all mycolactone-producing mycobacteria share a common ancestor distinct from non- mycolactone-producing M. marinum.
