History The company's history can be traced from the music contents division of Blue Cord Technology, established in 1991. The same division then owned Muz (now Olleh Music), one of the major music portals in the country. The division was also strengthened by the acquisition of Doremi Media (one of South Korea's well-known music publishers) in 2000. In 2007, Blue Cord was acquired by KT Freetel, and upon merging with the former, made the music division a separate company named KTF Music.

Bourgeois Dignity focuses on arguing that there was a fairly significant and unprecedented takeoff of economic growth, and that existing explanations for this takeoff are inadequate. McCloskey provides a rough outline for why she thinks that the changes in rhetoric surrounding the dignity of business and markets were crucial, but leaves the elaborate case for later books in the series. Reception=Promotion Around the time of the book release, National Review published an interview of McCloskey. McCloskey has also given lengthy talks on the themes of the book, some of which can be found online. A June 2013 event at the Cato Institute featuring McCloskey, and titled How Markets and Innovation Became Ethical and Then Suspect, was about McCloskey's next planned book in the series. Other participants were Donald Boudreaux and Dalibor Rohac. Book reviews Shortly prior to the release of the book, the themes of the book were discussed in the Cato Unbound October 2010 issue, with McCloskey as the lead essayist. The other participants were Gregory Clark, Matt Ridley, and Jonathan Feinstein. Gregory Clark, who is famous for his book A Farewell to Alms, argued that economics must explain the modern world, because changes in rhetoric had happened many times in the past without any accompanying economic change. Matt Ridley, famous as a popularizer of science as well as author of The Rational Optimist, made a similar point, and also argued that the ready availability of coal might have been a critical factor in allowing the Industrial Revolution to take off in the United Kingdom. Feinstein argued that the revolution in human creativity had just begun, and needed to be taken further in the 21st century. The participants made a number of additional posts responding to each other's points. Donald Boudreaux, economics professor at George Mason University and blogger at Cafe Hayek, reviewed the book very favorably for The Independent Review, the peer-reviewed journal of the Independent Institute. Boudreaux's chief criticism was that the subtitle's criticism of economics might be referring to too narrow a conception of economics and that the broader tradition of economics (that would include McCloskey's own work) would be exempt from this criticism. Henry Clark of Clemson University reviewed the book for the Erasmus Journal for Philosophy and Economics. Clark's review emphasized that McCloskey's case was not yet complete and that McCloskey would need to successfully address a number of issues (that he listed) in order to convince people of her thesis. Clark also noted the similarity between McCloskey's book and Steven Pinker's book The Better Angels of Our Nature on the decline of violence. Hugo Mercier of the University of Pennsylvania wrote a mixed review of the book for the International Cognition and Culture Institute, to which McCloskey wrote a lengthy response. Sandra Peart reviewed the book for The Freeman. Peart praised McCloskey's arguments and said she eagerly awaits the next book of the series to understand McCloskey's argument better. Diane Coyle wrote a mixed but generally favorable review of the book for the New Statesman. Arthur (Art) Diamond wrote a mixed but generally favorable review of the book. Rich Lowry reviewed the book for National Review, Andrew Morriss reviewed the book for Books and Culture, and Jack High reviewed the book for the Review of Austrian Economics.

She, together with her husband James Henry Sevier established the Advaita Ashrama in Mayavati, a branch of the Ramakrishna Order, in the Himalayas. Meeting Swami Vivekananda Captain James Henry Sevier, a disciple of Swami Vivekananda James Henry Sevier was a non commissioned officer in the British army. Both he and his wife Charlotte Elizabeth Sevier had been seekers of spiritual knowledge. In the course of his second visit to London, Swami Vivekananda delivered several lectures and also participated in private parlors. The Sevier couple had attended the lectures and was attracted by the philosophy, esp. his dissertations on Advaita Vedanta, the non dual aspects of Vedanta of Sankaracharya. The very first time they met the Swami in private, the latteer addressed Mrs. Sevier as \\"mother\\" and appealed to her to come to India, where he promised that he would give them the best of his realizations. The husband and wife both decided to become disciples of Swami Vivekananda and follow him to India. In 1896, the Seviers accompanied Swami Vivekananda to his travels in the continent of Europe, through Switzerland, Italy and Germany, esp. in the Alps. Seviers had arranged for the trip in order to enable the Swami to take some rest. In Alps Swami Vivekananda had expressed his desire to have a monastery in the Himalayas, an ideal which became a mission with the Seviers. Seviers accompanied the Swami when the latter returned to India, after selling all their properties in England. They stayed in Almora in the Himalayas. Swami Vivekananda visited Mayavati on hearing the news of the demise of Captain Sevier from 3 to 18 January 1901. Advaita Ashrama, Mayavati Sister Nivedita, Sister Christine,Mrs. Sevier and Lady Abala Bose in Mayavati In 1898, The Prabuddha Bharata or Awakened India magazine which was published by the madras disciples at the behest of Swami Vivekananda, faced a crisis. Swami Vivekananda then entrusted the Seviers to look after the publication of this magazine and he provided his disciple Swami Swarupananda to be the editor. Along with Swami Swarupananda, the Seviers made a tour of the Almora district and came across the estate of Mayavati at an elevation of 6000 to 7000 ft with its enchanting views of the Himalayan hills and valleys. There the Seviers established the Advaita Ashrama, the first monastic branch of the Ramakrishna Order in the Himalayas, dedicated to the contemplation of THE ONENESS OF ALL BEINGS. After establishing the monastery from where they started publishing the magazine again, the Seviers led an austere life together with four monks. Captain Sevier died on 28 October 1900 after suffering from urinary infection. Mrs. Sevier continued to live in Mayavati Ashrama. Many eminent persons visited the Advaita Ashrama. The list included Sister Nivedita, Sister Christine, Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose and his wife Lady Abala Bose, Chittaranjan Das, Nandalal Bose, Gertrude Emerson Sen, Josephine MacLeod, and Marie Louise Burke among others. Contributions Apart from establishing the Advaita Ashrama, Mrs. Sevier also looked after the day-to-day running. She also assisted in the editing of the Prabuddha Bharat magazine and contributed towards compilation and editing of the Life of Swami Vivekananda by Eastern and Western Disciples. She also contributed in compiling the Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda. Mrs. Sevier also purchased land for Vivekananda Ashrama at Shyamla Tal. She contributed towards the \\"Vivekananda Memorial Temple Fund\\" to build a temple at the site of Swami Vivekananda's cremation.

On October, 27 the unveiling event was attended by Cardinal Lubomyr Husar and Bishop of Ternopil- Zboriv Archdiocese Mykhaylo Sabryha. –ê–Ω–¥—Ä–µ–π –®–µ–ø—Ç–∏—Ü—å–∫–∏–π ‚Äî –Ω–∞ —Å–≤–æ—ó–π –∑–µ–º–ª—ñ // –í—ñ–ª—å–Ω–µ –∂–∏—Ç—Ç—è. ‚Äî ‚Ññ 108 (14138). ‚Äî 30 –∂–æ–≤—Ç–Ω—è 2001 —Ä. ‚Äî –°. 1.

However, the construction which started in 1986, has not yet been completed due to lack of funds.

According to Oleg Golovchak if the project was annually allocated at least 500 thousand hryvnias since 1991, it would have been already completed. If the current situation is saved, there is a danger of the chaotic development of Square of the Euromaidan Heroes (formerly Square of Arts), where the unfinished library is located. This can significantly spoil the look of the center of Ternopil.

It is a monotypic genus with only a single species, Maeotias marginata, commonly known as the Black Sea jellyfish or brackish water hydromedusa and often referred to as Maeotias inexpectata in the literature. It was first described from the Don and Kuban estuaries of the Sea of Azov (which was called the Lake of Maeotis in antiquity), and also occurs in the Black Sea, all of which are areas of low salinity. It has been recorded in several other estuarine locations around the world and is regarded as an invasive species. Description M. marginata has a small medusa with a bell diameter of up to . It is hemispherical in shape and the gonads hang from the four distinctive radial canals. The marginal ring canal has 50 short centripetal canals branching from it with a dense marginal fringe of about 600 short trailing tentacles. This hydrozoan is opaque white with a slightly reddish tinge near the bell margin. Distribution Maeotias marginata is native to the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea. It has spread to other parts of the world and was first detected in North America in 1968 in the estuaries of rivers entering Chesapeake Bay. It is thought to have been brought to America by shipping. The polyp stage possibly arrived as a fouling organism on the hull of a ship but it is unlikely that a brackish water species would have survived such a long voyage through saline ocean water. Alternatively, it may have arrived as an egg or as an encysted dormant stage of a polyp. More likely, perhaps, it arrived in a ballast tank or in the bilge water in a vessel. In 1999, it was observed in the northern Baltic Sea, and specimens have also been found in the Netherlands (1962), France (1971) and the Pacific coast of North America, where it was found in the estuaries of the Petaluma and Napa Rivers flowing into San Francisco Bay in 1992 and 1993, and has since become established. Biology The feeding behaviour of M. marginata has been observed in a shallow-water location with seagrasses growing in sand. It uses rhythmic contractions of the bell to move upwards through the water, then it flattens the bell and extends its tentacles widely and drifts slowly downwards, finally resting on the bottom in the same extended position for a while. During this descent, it captures and feeds on the zooplankton it encounters and small benthic organisms may be caught underneath as it lands. Its diet consists mostly of small crustaceans, including barnacle larvae, copepod eggs and larvae, and crab larvae. M. marginata can reproduce both sexually and asexually, by budding. All individuals found in the Napa and Petaluma River population are male, and must have been produced asexually following the original introduction of perhaps a single male polyp.

The field of molecular paleontology has yielded important insights into evolutionary events, species' diasporas, the discovery and characterization of extinct species. By applying molecular analytical techniques to DNA in fossils, one can quantify the level of relatedness between any two organisms for which DNA has been recovered. Advancements in the field of molecular paleontology have allowed scientists to pursue evolutionary questions on a genetic level rather than relying on phenotypic variation alone. Using various biotechnological techniques such as DNA isolation, amplification, and sequencing scientists have been able to gain expanded new insights into the divergence and evolutionary history of countless organisms. History The study of molecular paleontology is said to have begun with the discovery by Abelson of 360 million year old amino acids preserved in fossil shells. However, Svante P√§√§bo is often the one considered to be the founder of the field of molecular paleontology. The field of molecular paleontology has had several major advances since the 1950s and is a continuously growing field. Below is a timeline showing notable contributions that have been made. Timeline A timeline demonstrating important dates in molecular paleontology. All of these dates are listed and specifically sourced in the History section under Timeline. mid-1950s: Abelson found preserved amino acids in fossil shells that were about 360 million years old. Produced idea of comparing fossil amino acid sequences with existing organism so that molecular evolution could be studied. 1970s: Fossil peptides are studied by amino acid analysis. Start to use whole peptides and immunological methods. Late 1970s: Palaeobotanists (can also be spelled as Paleobotanists) studied molecules from well-preserved fossil plants. 1984: The first successful DNA sequencing of an extinct species, the quagga, a zebra- like species. 1991: Published article on the successful extraction of proteins from the fossil bone of a dinosaur, specifically the seismosaurus. 2005: Scientists resurrect extinct 1918 influenza virus. 2006: Neanderthals nuclear DNA sequence segments begin to be analyzed and published. 2007: Scientists synthesize entire extinct human endogenous retrovirus (HERV-K) from scratch. 2010: A new species of early hominid, the Denisovans, discovered from mitochondrial and nuclear genomes recovered from bone found in a cave in Siberia. Analysis showed that the Denisovan specimen lived approximately 41,000 years ago, and shared a common ancestor with both modern humans and Neanderthals approximately 1 million years ago in Africa. 2013: The first entire Neanderthal genome is successfully sequenced. More information can be found at the Neanderthal genome project. 2013: A 400,000-year-old specimen with remnant mitochondrial DNA sequenced and is found to be a common ancestor to Neanderthals and Denisovans, later named Homo heidelbergensis. 2015: A 110,000-year-old fossil tooth containing DNA from Denisovans was reported. The quagga The first successful DNA sequencing of an extinct species was in 1984, from a 150-year-old museum specimen of the quagga, a zebra-like species. Mitochondrial DNA (also known as mtDNA) was sequenced from desiccated muscle of the quagga, and was found to differ by 12 base substitutions from the mitochondrial DNA of a mountain zebra. It was concluded that these two species had a common ancestor 3-4 million years ago, which is consistent with known fossil evidence of the species. Denisovans The Denisovans of Eurasia, a hominid species related to Neanderthals and humans, was discovered as a direct result of DNA sequencing of a 41,000-year-old specimen recovered in 2008. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA from a retrieved finger bone showed the specimen to be genetically distinct from both humans and Neanderthals. Two teeth and a toe bone were later found to belong to different individuals with the same population. Analysis suggests that both the Neanderthals and Denisovans were already present throughout Eurasia when modern humans arrived. In November 2015, scientists reported finding a fossil tooth containing DNA from Denisovans, and estimated its age at 110,000-years-old. =Mitochondrial DNA analysis= Neanderthal DNA extraction. Working in a clean room, researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, took extensive precautions to avoid contaminating Neanderthal DNA samples - extracted from bones like this one - with DNA from any other source, including modern humans. NHGRI researchers are part of the international team that sequenced the genome of the Neanderthal, Homo neanderthalensis. The mtDNA from the Denisovan finger bone differs from that of modern humans by 385 bases (nucleotides) in the mtDNA strand out of approximately 16,500, whereas the difference between modern humans and Neanderthals is around 202 bases. In contrast, the difference between chimpanzees and modern humans is approximately 1,462 mtDNA base pairs. This suggested a divergence time around one million years ago. The mtDNA from a tooth bore a high similarity to that of the finger bone, indicating they belonged to the same population. From a second tooth, an mtDNA sequence was recovered that showed an unexpectedly large number of genetic differences compared to that found in the other tooth and the finger, suggesting a high degree of mtDNA diversity. These two individuals from the same cave showed more diversity than seen among sampled Neanderthals from all of Eurasia, and were as different as modern-day humans from different continents. =Nuclear genome analysis= Isolation and sequencing of nuclear DNA has also been accomplished from the Denisova finger bone. This specimen showed an unusual degree of DNA preservation and low level of contamination. They were able to achieve near-complete genomic sequencing, allowing a detailed comparison with Neanderthal and modern humans. From this analysis, they concluded, in spite of the apparent divergence of their mitochondrial sequence, the Denisova population along with Neanderthal shared a common branch from the lineage leading to modern African humans. The estimated average time of divergence between Denisovan and Neanderthal sequences is 640,000 years ago, and the time between both of these and the sequences of modern Africans is 804,000 years ago. They suggest the divergence of the Denisova mtDNA results either from the persistence of a lineage purged from the other branches of humanity through genetic drift or else an introgression from an older hominin lineage. Homo heidelbergensis \\"Homo heidelbergensis Cranium 5 is one of the most important discoveries in the Sima de los Huesos, Atapuerca (Spain). The mandible of this cranium appeared, nearly intact, some years after its find, close to the same location. Homo heidelbergensis was first discovered in 1907 near Heidelberg, Germany and later also found elsewhere in Europe, Africa, and Asia. However it was not until 2013 that a specimen with retrievable DNA was found, in a ~400,000 year old femur found in the Sima de los Huesos Cave in Spain. The femur was found to contain both mtDNA and nuclear DNA. Improvements in DNA extraction and library preparation techniques allowed for mtDNA to be successfully isolated and sequenced, however the nuclear DNA was found to be too degraded in the observed specimen, and was also contaminated with DNA from an ancient cave bear (Ursus deningeri) present in the cave. The mtDNA analysis found a surprising link between the specimen and the Denisovans, and this finding raised many questions. Several scenarios were proposed in a January 2014 paper titled \\"A mitochondrial genome sequence of a hominin from Sima de los Huesos\\", elucidating the lack of convergence in the scientific community on how Homo heidelbergensis is related to other known hominin groups. One plausible scenario that the authors proposed was that the H. heidelbergensis was an ancestor to both Denisovans and Neanderthals. Completely sequenced nuclear genomes from both Denisovans and Neanderthals suggest a common ancestor approximately 700,000 years ago, and one leading researcher in the field, Svante Paabo, suggests that perhaps this new hominin group is that early ancestor. Applications= Discovery and characterization of new species  Molecular paleontology techniques applied to fossils have contributed to the discovery and characterization of several new species, including the Denisovans and Homo heidelbergensis. We have been able to better understand the path that humans took as they populated the earth, and what species were present during this diaspora. De-extinction The Pyrenean ibex was temporarily brought back from extinction in 1984. It is now possible to revive extinct species using molecular paleontology techniques. This was first accomplished via cloning in 2003 with the Pyrenean ibex, a type of wild goat that became extinct in 2000. Nuclei from the Pyrenean ibex's cells were injected into goat eggs emptied of their own DNA, and implanted into surrogate goat mothers. The offspring lived only seven minutes after birth, due to defects in its lungs. Other cloned animals have been observed to have similar lung defects. There are many species that have gone extinct as a direct result of human activity. Some examples include the dodo, the great auk, the Tasmanian tiger, the Chinese river dolphin, and the passenger pigeon. An extinct species can be revived by using allelic replacement of a closely related species that is still living. By only having to replace a few genes within an organism, instead of having to build the extinct species' genome from scratch, it could be possible to bring back several species in this way, even Neanderthals. The ethics surrounding the re-introduction of extinct species are very controversial. Critics of bringing extinct species back to life contend that it would divert limited money and resources from protecting the world's current biodiversity problems. With current extinction rates approximated to be 100 to 1,000 times the background extinction rate, it is feared that a de-extinction program might lessen public concerns over the current mass extinction crisis, if it is believed that these species can simply be brought back to life. As the editors of a Scientific American article on de-extinction pose: Should we bring back the woolly mammoth only to let elephants become extinct in the meantime? The main driving factor for the extinction of most species in this era (post 10,000 BC) is the loss of habitat, and temporarily bringing back an extinct species will not recreate the environment they once inhabited. Proponents of de-extinction, such as George Church, speak of many potential benefits. Reintroducing an extinct keystone species, such as the woolly mammoth, could help re-balance the ecosystems that once depended on them. Some extinct species could create broad benefits for the environments they once inhabited, if returned. For example, woolly mammoths may be able to slow the melting of the Russian and Arctic tundra in several ways such as eating dead grass so that new grass can grow and take root, and periodically breaking up the snow, subjecting the ground below to the arctic air. These techniques could also be used to reintroduce genetic diversity in a threatened species, or even introduce new genes and traits to allow the animals to compete better in a changing environment. Research and technology When a new potential specimen is found, scientists normally first analyze for cell and tissue preservation using histological techniques, and test the conditions for the survivability of DNA. They will then attempt to isolate a DNA sample using the technique described below, and conduct a PCR amplification of the DNA to increase the amount of DNA available for testing. This amplified DNA is then sequenced. Care is taken to verify that the sequence matches the phylogenetic traits of the organism. When an organism dies, a technique called amino acid dating can be used to age the organism. It inspects the degree of racemization of aspartic acid, leucine, and alanine within the tissue. As time passes, the D/L ratio (where \\"D\\" and \\"L\\" are mirror images of each other) increase from 0 to 1. In samples where the D/L ratio of aspartic acid is greater than 0.08, ancient DNA sequences can not be retrieved (as of 1996).  Mitochondrial DNA vs. nuclear DNA  Unlike nuclear DNA (left), mitochondrial DNA is only inherited from the maternal lineage (right). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is separate from one's nuclear DNA. It is present in organelles called mitochondria in each cell. Unlike nuclear DNA, which is inherited from both parents and rearranged every generation, an exact copy of mitochondrial DNA gets passed down from mother to her sons and daughters. The benefits of performing DNA analysis with Mitochondrial DNA is that it has a far smaller mutation rate than nuclear DNA, making tracking lineages on the scale of tens of thousands of years much easier. Knowing the base mutation rate for mtDNA, (in humans this rate is also known as the Human mitochondrial molecular clock) one can determine the amount of time any two lineages have been separated. Another advantage of mtDNA is that thousands of copies of it exist in every cell, whereas only two copies of nuclear DNA exist in each cell. All eukaryotes, a group which includes all plants, animals, and fungi, have mtDNA. A disadvantage of mtDNA is that only the maternal line is represented. For example, a child will inherit 1/8 of its DNA from each of its eight great-grandparents, however it will inherit an exact clone of its maternal great-grandmother's mtDNA. This is analogous to a child inheriting only his paternal great-grandfather's last name, and not a mix of all of the eight surnames. Isolation There are many things to consider when isolating a substance. First, depending upon what it is and where it is located, there are protocols that must be carried out in order to avoid contamination and further degradation of the sample. Then, handling of the materials is usually done in a physically isolated work area and under specific conditions (i.e. specific Temperature, moisture, etc...) also to avoid contamination and further loss of sample. Once the material has been obtained, depending on what it is, there are different ways to isolate and purify it. DNA extraction from fossils is one of the more popular practices and there are different steps that can be taken to get the desired sample. DNA extracted from amber-entombed fossils can be taken from small samples and mixed with different substances, centrifuged, incubated, and centrifuged again. On the other hand, DNA extraction from insects can be done by grinding the sample, mixing it with buffer, and undergoing purification through glass fiber columns. In the end, regardless of how the sample was isolated for these fossils, the DNA isolated must be able to undergo amplification. Amplification Polymerase chain reaction The field of molecular paleontology benefited greatly from the invention of the polymerase chain reaction(PCR), which allows one to make billions of copies of a DNA fragment from just a single preserved copy of the DNA. One of the biggest challenges up until this point was the extreme scarcity of recovered DNA because of degradation of the DNA over time. Sequencing DNA sequencing is done to determine the order of nucleotides and genes. There are many different materials from which DNA can be extracted. In animals, the mitochondrial chromosome can be used for molecular study. Chloroplasts can be studied in plants as a primary source of sequence data. An evolutionary tree of mammals In the end, the sequences generated are used to build evolutionary trees. Methods to match data sets include: maximum probability, minimum evolution (also known as neighbor-joining) which searches for the tree with shortest overall length, and the maximum parsimony method which finds the tree requiring the fewest character-state changes. The groups of species defined within a tree can also be later evaluated by statistical tests, such as the bootstrap method, to see if they are indeed significant. Limitations and challenges Ideal environmental conditions for preserving DNA where the organism was desiccated and uncovered are difficult to come by, as well as maintaining their condition until analysis. Nuclear DNA normally degrades rapidly after death by endogenous hydrolytic processes, by UV radiation, and other environmental stressors. Also, interactions with the organic breakdown products of surrounding soil have been found to help preserve biomolecular materials. However, they have also created the additional challenge of being able to separate the various components in order to be able to conduct the proper analysis on them. Some of these breakdowns have also been found to interfere with the action of some of the enzymes used during PCR. Finally, one of the largest challenge in extracting ancient DNA, particularly in ancient human DNA, is in contamination during PCR. Small amounts of human DNA can contaminate the reagents used for extraction and PCR of ancient DNA. These problems can be overcome by rigorous care in the handling of all solutions as well as the glassware and other tools used in the process. It can also help if only one person performs the extractions, to minimize different types of DNA present.

In addition, some of them are farmers in the city.'' :''West Taraka :West Taraka is situated in the north-western part of the city, and Boundary Road is situated in the mid-western part of the city. Both grew rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s because of migration from the Highlands areas.'' The study found that almost half of the informants (48.5%) came to Lae in the 1980s. The figure is much higher in Mouth Markham (66.7%). East Sepik Province (30.3%) and the provinces in the Highlands (30.3%) stand out as places where the informants lived before they came to Lae. This tendency corresponds to the fact that most respondents were born in the Sepik and Highlands areas and less than half of them have had former migration experiences. The people from East Sepik tend to live in Mouth Markham, and those from the Highlands tend to concentrate in the West Taraka and Boundary Road settlements respectively. 57.6 percent of respondents came to Lae for employment. However, it is also true that their relatives (60.6%), were staying in Lae before the respondents moved to Lae. In May 1993, a study focused on the West Taraka Housing scheme and found that tenants were significantly dissatisfied with their houses. Aspects of dissatisfaction referred to the size of houses, number of rooms and living/dining areas, lack of storage space, and poorly laid out and badly designed kitchen, toilet, and bathroom facilities.Kaitilla, S, 1993, Satisfaction with Public Housing in Papua New Guinea, The Case of West Taraka Housing Scheme, Environment and Behavior, May 1993 vol. 25 no. 3 514-545, Department of Architecture and Building at the Papua New Guinea University of Technology In 2011 another study on housing was conducted drawing on the 1973 - 1974 urban household survey which revealed that less than 40% of the urban households had built and owned the houses they lived in. Five years after the establishment of the National Housing Corporation (NHC), another urban household survey revealed that only 10% of all houses in Lae were either rented or leased directly and the corresponding figure for Port Moresby was 23%. Another study by the Bank of Papua New Guinea examined the demand for urban housing finance which found that two factors discouraged individual investment in urban home-ownership in Papua New Guinea. Firstly the rental housing market in Papua New Guinea was, and still is, heavily subsidised by the government and associated with paying rates, taxes and other regular repair and maintenance costs. Secondly most Papua New Guineans held strong ties with their rural areas and many people were unprepared to sever these ties for several reasons, for instance, fear of being accused by wantoks (relatives and friends) of running away from rural obligations. Public housing in Papua New Guinea is not only unavailable, but also unattainable for a large proportion (60.0%) of the urban population. It is evident that even the 1981 housing policy that encouraged national home- ownership schemes has not significantly increased home-ownership.

It was directed by Ed Wood (who also wrote the script) and served as a star vehicle for Tom Keene. Keene had become known as a star of B movie Westerns in the 1930s and 1940s, but was experiencing a downturn in his career in the 1950s.Craig (2009), p. 16-20 Wood served as both writer and director. He also had a small acting role as a Pony Express rider.Hayes (2001), p. 125 The film lasts 25 minutes. The series failed to find a buyer. It was eventually combined with another Western starring Keene into a longer film called The Adventures of the Tucson Kid and was syndicated to television c. 1954.Craig (2009), p. 16-20 Plot Keene plays the \\"Tucson Kid\\", an insurance investigator who travels to any town where a suspicious insurance claim has appeared.Craig (2009), p. 16-20 The career description would allow the proposed series to adopt an anthology format, with a different location and storyline in each episode.Craig (2009), p. 16-20 The other hero of the story is a sheriff's deputy called Ed (Tom Tyler). Both are middle aged men.Craig (2009), p. 16-20 The film is set in a small town by the name of Crossroads. The Tucson Kid, under the alias Duke Smith, is here to investigate the burning of a saloon and the reason the owner demands payment in cash by the insurance company. Said owner is local businessman Bart Miller (Lyle Talbot), who recently arranged the murder of Jim Hawks (the co-owner of the saloon) and the destruction of the saloon in an act of arson. The murdered man was also the local sheriff. Miller employs a criminal gang consisting of Dance (Don Nagle), Lefty (Kenne Duncan), and Max (Bud Osborne).Craig (2009), p. 16-20 The gang intends to frame someone for the recent murder and by chance they choose the Tucson Kid. A lynch mob soon gathers, but the prisoner is rescued by \\"desert rat\\" Zeke (Harvey B. Dunn). Ed arranges for \\"Duke Smith\\" to remain in Zeke's custody.Craig (2009), p. 16-20 Zeke soon reveals to his guest that Hawks was locked up in the saloon and supposed to die in the fire. He rescued the man from the flames, only to see him murdered shortly afterwards. He suspects Bart Miller was the murderer.Craig (2009), p. 16-20 Elsewhere, the gang conspires to murder Zeke and frame \\"Duke\\" for the murder.Craig (2009), p. 16-20 In the resulting gunfight, Zeke is killed and Lefty is wounded. The Tucson Kid buries the man in a makeshift grave.Craig (2009), p. 16-20 The gang exhumes the body and alerts Ed, who insists that the body should be left to rest in peace. He also insists on a fair trial for \\"Duke\\". At this point \\"Duke\\" reveals the findings of his recent investigation. The partnership of Hawks and Miller extended to a new drilling rig, and the two had found oil. But Hawks was entitled to a lion's share of the profits, which was the motive of his murder.Craig (2009), p. 16-20 Realizing that \\"Duke\\" and Ed now know the truth, Miller orders his gang to attack. All the villains are killed, including Miller whose death is the result of a friendly fire incident. Ed thanks the Tucson Kid for his help, and the investigator rides out of town.

It originally aired on November 19, 2009. The episode's story was written by Barbie Kligman and the teleplay by Kevin Williamson and Julie Plec. It was directed by J. Miller Tobin. Plot The episode starts where the previous one ended, with Logan (Chris Johnson) asking Jenna (Sara Canning) to invite him in the house. Jenna slams the door in his face and an upset Logan attacks, bites and kills a woman who passes by at the moment. Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) goes through his dad's stuff and an old journal he found. The journal is filled with notes and drawings of strange creatures, something that makes him start drawing again. Damon (Ian Somerhalder) and Stefan (Paul Wesley) discuss where they should go now that they are leaving Mystic Falls when the doorbell rings. Stefan opens the door and sees Sheriff Forbes (Marguerite MacIntyre), who asks for Damon. She tells Damon that there was a new vampire attack in the town, something that surprises him. Stefan overhears their conversation and asks Damon if it was him. Damon reassures him that there is a new vampire in town and they decide not to leave till they find him. Caroline (Candice Accola) and Matt (Zach Roerig) get closer. Everyone notices including Tyler (Michael Trevino), who grills Matt about it. Bonnie (Kat Graham) is still a little freaked out about being attacked by Damon but she is grateful to Stefan who saved her life. Stefan shows up at school to inform Elena (Nina Dobrev) about the new vampire and to be careful till they find out who it is. Damon tries to track down the new vampire using the watch he took from Logan but because he cannot do it himself (its signal interferes with his vampire nature) he asks for Caroline's help and then he compels her to forget everything. The watch leads him to a warehouse where he is ambushed and shot by Logan. Damon is surprised seeing him and wants to know who turned him. Logan believes Damon was the one who did it and he asks him how he can walk in the sun. Back at the school, there is a career fair where Jeremy sees a sketch that Tyler drew. He tries to talk to him but Tyler gets aggressive and they end up fighting. Tyler's dad, the Mayor, separates them and takes them outside where he asks them to fight and solve their differences as men. Alaric (Matt Davis), who followed them outside, asks what is going on and he faces off the Mayor stopping him from making the two boys fight. Elena catches up with Matt asking him about Caroline and telling him about Stefan. Matt says that he and Caroline are only friends while Caroline watches the two of them talking from a distance. Stefan interrupts them and he tries to update Elena about the new vampire when Jenna comes and tells them that Logan is at the school. Stefan, who knows that Logan was supposed to be dead, realizes that he is the new vampire and leaves to find him. Elena asks what is going on and Stefan asks her to take Jenna and go. Elena understands his tone and leaves, telling Jenna not to talk again to Logan. Meanwhile, Logan asks Stefan how he can walk in the sunlight and he threatens to expose him if he will not tell him. Stefan stands up to him and he leaves. In the meantime, Caroline announces to her mom that she wants to be a broadcast journalist but her mom is not impressed stating that Caroline does not even read the paper. Caroline leaves and Logan confronts the Sheriff for whom he believes is the one who buried him and covered his \\"death\\". He threatens her and then leaves while Sheriff calls for backup. Logan sees Caroline outside being stood up by Bonnie and offers to drive her home. Matt sees Caroline getting into Logan's car but he does not see Logan knock her unconscious before driving away. Stefan is at the phone with Damon talking about Logan. Damon is angry about the ambush and wants to kill Logan. He is heading right at the school as soon as Stefan tells him that Logan is there. Elena comes to Stefan asking about Logan when Matt comes and tells them that Caroline left with him. Elena is terrified and Stefan leaves to find Caroline. Logan calls the Sheriff to tell her that he has her daughter and he will turn her into a vampire when Stefan and Damon appear and pull him out of the car. Damon shoots him with wooden bullets and sends Stefan off to take Caroline home. Damon informs the Sheriff where they are via the radio and then he starts interrogating Logan trying to find out who turned him. Logan still says he does not know but the moment Damon is about to kill him, Logan says to Damon that he and the vampire who turned him have another way to raise the vampires who are trapped under the Fell's Church, including Katherine. Damon is shocked but he wants to believe him and, while the Sheriff approaches, he asks Logan to knock him down and make it look real. Logan throws Damon away and escapes. After taking Caroline home, Stefan gets back to school to find Elena. He tells her that they cannot be together and she offers to drive him home. Elena tries to convince him that he is not responsible for what is happening in her life since her life was painful way before his arrival. Stefan is not convinced though and he walks away. Elena shouts at him that she loves him. Stefan, hearing that, gets back to her and kisses her. The two of them get into the house and sleep together for the first time. Logan heads to his car to go and find Damon but he runs into Alaric. Alaric warns him to stay away from Jenna because she deserves the best. Logan makes fun of how stupid he is and then tries to attack him but Alaric stakes him in the heart and kills him. The Sheriff finds Logan's body and calls Damon to thank him, thinking that he killed him. Damon, who was waiting for Logan at the Fell's Church, is shocked hearing the news and has no idea who might have killed Logan. Back at Stefan's bedroom, Stefan leaves the room to bring Elena something to drink, leaving her alone. Elena starts walking around the room checking on Stefan's things when she sees Katherine's picture. She is in shock seeing how much she looks like her and she immediately leaves. Stefan comes back looking for her but he cannot find her. He sees the necklace he gave her on Katherine's picture and understands that Elena saw it. The episode ends with Elena driving back home in tears when suddenly a figure appears in front of her. She tries to avoid him but she hits him and her car flips over trapping her in the driver's seat. She turns her head and watches that the figure reanimates itself, gets up and starts walking towards her.

Reviews \\"The Turning Point\\" received positive reviews. Robin Franson Pruter from Forced Viewing rated the episode with 3/4 saying that ultimately, the episode was strong just not outstanding. \\"A solid episode moves the plot as characters examine their futures and learn about new threats in town. This episode covers a lot of ground, with a number of little developments in multiple storylines. And, while all the material in this episode is solid, nothing in the episode reaches the level of excellence that the scenes between the Salvatore brothers reached in \\"History Repeating.\\"\\" Lauren Attaway of Star Pulse gave a B- rate to the episode saying: \\"Last night's episode of The Vampire Diaries could not have had a more fitting title, because it was all about turns in the storylines and the characters' lives.\\" Josie Kafka from Doux Reviews rated the episode with 3.5/4 saying that it was the one who made her a convert when she first watched the show. \\"Looking back, I think the past five episodes have been pretty darn awesome. I also realize the comedy inherent in being turned by an episode called \\"The Turning Point.\\"\\" Matt Richenthal from TV Fanatic gave a good review to the episode saying that \\"...this was yet another outstanding installment of the best new show on television...\\". He continued by commenting on the relationship between the two Salvatore brothers: \\"They may never truly be on the same side, but a good show finds interesting ways to develop characters and keep their interactions fresh. The Vampire Diaries is a good show.\\" Popsugar of Buzzsugar gave a good review to the episode highlighting that she can't wait for the show to come back after its hiatus. \\"I was already bummed knowing this was the last week of new episodes of The Vampire Diaries until January; and now, having seen it, I'm freaking out a little bit. I knew there was going to be an epic cliffhanger, I just didn't know how epic! [...] I don't know how I'm going to deal with the show's hiatus for two long months, let alone waiting that long to find out what was coming for Elena. Or, who Alaric is; did he kill Logan to protect Jenna, eliminate a problem-causing newborn, or something more insidious?\\" Lucia from Heroine TV also wrote a good review saying: \\"...the plot twists keep on coming in this increasingly mythology-driven show. Last night‚Äôs episode was no exception, as we were treated to one surprise after another, culminating in a seemingly dire cliffhanger.\\" Tiffany Vogt from The TV Watchtower stated that the episode has a little bit of everything for everyone. \\"This was indeed the turning point for everyone. It was no longer a show about the discovery of vampires. This is now a story about how virtually everyone knows there are vampires and how they interact with them.\\" Notes *In next episodes we learn that once all the people who live in a house die, vampires can entry without an invitation. In this episode though, Logan says that he can't get into his house since he was living alone and there is no one to invite him in. Logan shouldn't have an issue getting into his house. * This was the mid-season finale episode before the show goes on a two-month hiatus.

An independent public school is a state/public school that, while a part of the state education system, has been granted a higher degree of decision-making authority than a regular, non-independent state school. The term, Independent Public School, has been increasingly used by other state governments in Australia, such as Queensland, to label similar reforms to the governance of their state schools. Federal Australian governments also use the term Independent Public Schools. In February 2014 the Federal Education Minister, Christopher Pyne, announced a $70 million Independent Public Schools Initiative to support 1500 state schools across Australia to become more autonomous.  Western Australia  The Independent Public Schools (IPS) initiative was launched in Western Australia in 2009 by then Education Minister Dr Elizabeth Constable and the State Premier Colin Barnett. The Independent Public Schools initiative in Western Australia is an opt-in program, meaning schools choose to become an independent public school. In 2009, primary and secondary state schools were invited for the first time to express an interest in becoming an IP school through an application process administered by the Western Australian Department of Education. Applying schools need to demonstrate their readiness for increased autonomy and accountability through demonstrating the principal and school administration have prudent and effective financial and staff management ability. Schools should also demonstrate that there is a benefit to the school of becoming an IP school, and that the school staff and local community support the application. Applications are assessed by an independent panel. In its first round, 34 schools were admitted into the program. These schools began operating as IP schools in 2010. Since 2010, the following number of schools have been admitted into the program: 64 in 2011, 73 in 2012, and 84 in 2013. A further nine new schools opened as Independent Public Schools in 2014. Over half of all public schools have sought to become Independent Public Schools since the initiative began in 2010.  Key features of IPS in Western Australia  Schools granted IPS status choose to opt into a number of \\"flexibilities\\" or \\"authorities\\". These include: * the authority to recruit and appoint staff, including teachers, new graduates and support staff, thereby circumventing the central placement process administered by the Department; * the authority to determine a school's staffing profile and to create new job descriptions and positions; * the authority to manage staff leave decisions and staff relief costs; * the authority to determine a school's professional development priority and program; * not being obliged to employ from the central recruitment pool, including redeployed staff; * the authority to manage a one-line budget; * the authority to award contracts and dispose of assets with values up to $150,000; * the authority to manage school utilities and facilities (including electricity, gas, water and waste) and to retain savings; * authority to determine curriculum to suit student needs. Independent Public Schools are also awarded a recurring payment of between $25,000 - $50,000 for administrative support, and $20,000-$40,000 one-off payments for transition costs. Independent Public Schools and their principals must: * create and convene a School Board to oversee the principal's management of the school; * create a business plan to guide the school for three years; * produce an annual school report and annual self-assessment; * be performance managed directly by the Department of Education Director- General. Principals are held accountable through a Delivery and Performance Agreement signed by the Principal, Chair of the School Board and Director- General. The Delivery and Performance Agreement identifies the resources and support the school will receive, programs the school will deliver, student achievement and how it will be monitored, and performance and accountability of the school; * be subject to financial audits; * determine and report on the satisfaction levels of students, staff and parents; * respect the existing industrial platform of the Department of Education which determines staff salaries, wages and conditions; * comply with relevant legislation, including School Education Act 1999, School Education Regulations 2000, and Public Sector Management Act 1994, and other Government and Department policies and external agreements; * comply with the mandated curriculum, as set out by the School Curriculum and Authority Act 1997. An Independent Public School, its principal and board cannot: * deny the enrolment of students who are eligible to attend their local school (a student who resides in the local area), although the school can enroll students from outside of the local area; * charge an enrolment fee for students to attend (outside of fees applicable to all public schools); * exclude students without following the requirements of the School Education Act 1999; * appoint or dismiss the principal.  Research and criticism  The Independent Public Schools initiative has been justified on the grounds that system decentralisation and principal autonomy improves the educational outcomes of students. A review of the Western Australian IPS initiative commissioned by the Department of Education (WA) was undertaken in 2013. This review found that principals welcomed the flexibilities offered by the program. There was no evidence of any change to attendance, suspension or academic achievement. The review noted that it was too early for the initiative to demonstrate an effect on student outcomes. A study in Victoria, Australia, following self-managing reforms in that state found no direct cause and effect between the decentralisation of decision-making in planning and resource allocation, and improved learning outcomes of students. A recent review of the literature into the effects of school autonomy concludes there is no causal link between autonomy and improved student learning outcomes, however local decision-making can improve learning outcomes in particular circumstances, such as where there are strong accountability mechanisms and a focus on improving the quality of teaching. The OECD has attempted to map the types and levels of autonomy across education systems, and to measure the impact of school autonomy on student performance. A comparison of the 2003 PISA results by the OECD concludes that different facets of school autonomy and accountability are associated with the level of student achievement - students perform better on average in schools with the authority to hire staff, but perform worse in schools with authority over formulating budgets. A comparison of the 2006 PISA results concludes that 'school level autonomy in relation to staffing, educational content and budgeting do not show a significant association with school performance. However, a system-level composition effect appears with regard to school autonomy in educational content as well as budgeting. Students in educational systems giving more autonomy to schools to choose textbooks, to determine course content, and to decide which courses to offer, tend to perform better regardless of whether the schools which individual students attend have higher degrees of autonomy or not'. A comparison of the 2012 PISA results concludes that school systems where schools have more autonomy over curricula and assessments tend to perform better overall, however the relationship between school autonomy and performance within countries is more complex, with factors such as accountability arrangements and teacher-principal collaboration in school management impacting on performance. Scholarly concern is registered about the effects of self-management and the deregulation of school choice that has accompanied it. These effects include: increased administrative burden on principals; levels of resourcing required to effectively self-govern; and the intensification of 'the gaps between schools serving the rich and those serving the poor, gaps marked by growing differences in school size, student intake, resources and achievement'. Other research explicitly situates IPS in its political and policy context. IPS has been criticised as a New Public Management reform not directed at improving the educational outcomes of students, but at reforming the public sector, particularly through introducing managerialist and market values, practices and mechanisms. IPS is also understood as a regulatory regime aligned with neoliberal modalities of governing. Using a Foucauldian theoretical approach to the IPS initiative, the rationalities, techniques and practices of IPS have been understood as transforming the identities of principals around the neoliberal norms of entrepreneurship, self-reliance and self-responsibility.

Career Liano's career in fashion started by chance in the early 1980s when Melbourne retailer Joe Silitto noticed a dress that she had made for her sister, and asked about selling the design. In 1983, Liano and her mother opened a shop, \\"Sempre L'Unico\\", in Toorak Village. The family business, which included Liano's two sisters, did well and they opened two more shops, in Chapel Street and the city. After leaving Sempre L'Unico to start her own business, Liano, with her husband Roy Christou, launched the eponymous Bettina Liano label in 1989. Two years later they started making jeans\\"spray-on-tight, hipster jeans\\", in contrast to the loose fitting styles of the timewhich became one of her most popular items. In 1999, Liano won a Federal Court injunction preventing Satch Clothing from selling clothes that had been made using her design in breach of copyright. She was one of the first designers in Australia to take such legal action to protect her intellectual property. She also won settlements against other stores copying of her designs. In 2005, Liano designed a collection of clothes for young girls, sold exclusively by Myer, under the children's clothing brand Barbie. In 2010, Liano launched a diffusion label \\"T by Bettina Liano\\", exclusive to Myer. She also won Cosmopolitan magazine's Fun Fearless Female award in the Designer category. In 2011, the business went into administration, but in 2012 recovered after striking a licensing agreement with the Sydney-based Apparel Group. Liano retained control of the business. At its peak, Liano had eight stores in Australia. In February 2013, Liano closed all except one of her Australian stores and opened one in SoHo, Manhattan. In September 2013 the business again went into administration. Subsequently the \\"Bettina Liano\\", \\"T by Bettina Liano\\" and \\"O Jeans\\" trademarks were acquired by the Apparel Group.

Matsesta is located in the mouth of the Matsesta River, half way between the center of Sochi and Adler. Matsesta is located in the Matsesta River valley and consists of four parts. Novaya Matsesta (New Matsesta) is located at the coast, Srednyaya Matsesta (Middle Matsesta) is upstream the river, and Staraya Matsesta (Old Matsesta) is even further from the sea. Verkhnyaya Matsesta (Upper Matsesta) is located uphill from Srednyaya Matsesta. History Cheltenham Alley, Matsesta The sulphur springs in Matsesta were first mentioned in literature in 1841. It was repeatedly proposed to found a spa here, until in 1901 the decision was taken by the authorities. The spa was opened on September 15, 1902, and Matsesta developed as a settlement serving the sulfur baths. It quickly developed as a resort in the 1900s. At the time, Matsesta belonged to Black Sea Governorate with the center in Novorossiysk. Soviet Power was declared in Matsesta in February 1918, followed by the advance of the army of the Democratic Republic of Georgia, which in July 1918 occupied the whole coast up to Tuapse. In February 1919, they were driven back by the Volunteer Army under command of Anton Denikin. Between January and May 1920, the Red Army recaptured the area. In 1933, it was decided to totally reconstruct the coastal area and to create a large number of spa resorts. To this end, in October 1934 Matsesta was subordinated to the city of Sochi. Khostinsky City District was established in 1951. Joseph Stalin had a summer house (datcha) in Matsesta, where he typically spent summers. Economy The economy of Matsesta is based on holiday tourism and on balneotherapy. Transportation The area is served by the Matsesta railway station. There is frequent suburban service between Sochi railway station and Adler railway station. The M27 Highway connecting Novorossiysk with Adler passes through Matsesta. The highway serves as the bypass road for the center of Sochi, and it joins the coast next to Matsesta. South of Matsesta, it follows the coast. There is also a road up the Matsesta River valley. Culture and recreation Matsesta hosts a major part of all resorts in Sochi. Some of those have been built in the 1930s and considered as good examples of early Soviet architecture. There is an aquarium in Novaya Matsesta.

The company still carries that message to this day. In 1971 Hooker Corporation acquired Prouds 72 stores and subsequently the business was sold to Goldmark Jewellers. In 1996 Pascoes purchased the then 93-year-old Australian jeweller, saving it from administration. In February 2008 Prouds lost a case against the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission over 'illusory' 'was/now' price advertising. The Federal Court of Australia found two of Prouds' catalogues, for Valentine's Day and Mother's Day 2006, breached the Trade Practices Act 1974. The decision has been labelled 'important', and Prouds conduct 'misleading and deceptive' Today In 1996, Prouds had 67 stores. This increased to over 195 in 2013. After the acquisition of Farmers, Prouds jewellery kiosks were included in some Farmers stores across New Zealand as store-within-a-store.

The show was produced by Ricky Kirshner and directed by Hamish Hamilton. At the time of airing the halftime show attracted the largest audience in the history of the Super Bowl, attracting 115.3 million viewers. The show was later surpassed by the following year's Super Bowl XLIX halftime show. The performance generated 2.2 million tweets, due to clamoring for tickets to Mars' Moonshine Jungle Tour. The Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show received two 2014 Primetime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Short-Format Live-Action Entertainment Program and Outstanding Lighting Design / Lighting Direction for a Variety Special. Background Bruno Mars performing in 2010 Red Hot Chili Peppers in 2006 Bruno Mars was confirmed as the lead half time performer for Super Bowl XLVIII in September 2013 during a Fox NFL Sunday broadcast held live in Times Square in New York City. The NFL's entertainment team started working with Mars and his management on the halftime set list around Thanksgiving week and spent the remainder of 2013 mapping out the production and staging, along with the guest list. In January 2014 it was announced that Mars had personally invited Red Hot Chili Peppers to perform as special guests during his performance. On January 24, 2014 during the game‚Äôs fourth quarter, Hyundai debuted the spot entitled ‚ÄúDad‚Äôs Sixth Sense‚Äù, that featured the 2016 Hyundai Genesis and Mars' single \\"Count on Me\\". The song was chosen \\"for reasons separate and coincidental from Mars‚Äô previously announced Half Time gig\\". During rehearsals there were some disagreements between Mars and the NFL, regarding the singer's performance. The latter wanted to show the audience wearing light-up bracelets to which Mars concurred \\"If you take that camera off me, you're doing yourself a disservice. And what happened? They spent all this money on these things, and it didn't work.\\" Fortunately, Mars and his band rehearsed a lot and it didn't matter if they had \\"cafeteria lighting\\" or a budget of $5 million (U.S.), the performance would always be the best they could do. According to the singer, \\"Every smoke machine and laser light is just a bonus.\\" Development The halftime show was produced by Ricky Kirshner and directed by Hamish Hamilton. Mars and his eight-piece band, The Hooligans, were dressed in clothes custom created by Saint Laurent by Hedi Slimane. Prince, Michael Jackson and James Brown used the same style in clothes; Mars worked a retro gold lame jacket paired with a white shirt, black trousers and a matching skinny tie. Mars made history at the Super Bowl XLVIII Halftime Show as the youngest artist ever to serve as the sole NFL Super Bowl Halftime headliner. He opened the show with a drum solo on a kit designed to honor his late mother, Bernadette Hernandez. The artwork was modeled after Mars' arm tattoo dedicated to his mom. During his performance of \\"Just the Way You Are\\" he was standing midfield, backed by the biggest firework display in NFL Super Bowl history. Montreal-based firm PixMob provided audience lighting effects during the show: \\"video ski hats\\" with LEDs and an infrared receiver were distributed to attendees of the game. Lighting cues were sent to the hats using infrared signals from around the stadium, transforming the audience into \\"pixels\\" of a giant \\"screen\\". Starting with this halftime show, the halftime show logo does not appear in the introduction. As well, the opening was changed to \\"The National Football League welcomes you to the (sponsor) Super Bowl (Numeral) Halftime Show\\". Setlist #\\"Billionaire\\" (Intro) (Children's choir) #Drum solo (Bruno Mars) #\\"Locked Out of Heaven\\" #\\"Treasure\\" #\\"Runaway Baby\\" #\\"Give It Away\\" (featuring Red Hot Chili Peppers) #\\"Just the Way You Are\\" (Tribute to the United States Armed Forces) Set list adapted from Billboard. Reception=Critical Mars' performance received generally positive reviews from critics, while the Red Hot Chili Peppers' appearance received mixed to negative reviews. Mike Bruno of Entertainment Weekly gave a positive review of the halftime performance, complimenting Mars' \\"impressive\\" vocal performance and stating that \\"there's no question the kid is talented\\". Entertainment Weekly also criticized the Red Hot Chili Peppers' involvement in the performance, stating that there was \\"nothing wrong\\" with their performance however that their presence was \\"random and unnecessary\\". Matthew Perpetua of Buzzfeed called Mars a \\"world class entertainer\\" and stated that Mars' performance was \\"dazzling\\" and \\"pretty awesome\\". However, Perpetua also stated that the Chili Peppers' presence was \\"unnecessary\\" and also noted that the halftime show was not as memorable as the previous year's show, which was performed by Beyonc√© Knowles. Lindsey Weber of Vulture stated it was unfair to compare Mars' performance to Knowles' and that the performance was \\"perfectly Bruno\\"; however, Weber also said that it was unlikely that people would \\"still be talking about\\" the performance the day after. Mikael Wood of Los Angeles Times stated that Mars \\"delivered\\" during the performance and showed viewers that he is a \\"real musician\\" however felt that the performance did not begin to feel \\"hopelessly retro\\" compared to Knowles' performance until the Chili Peppers joined Mars. Wood felt that the Chili Peppers' performance was \\"stale\\" and unwanted and stated that Mars did not need any guests to make the performance special. Chris Chase and Chris Strauss of USA Today gave a mixed review of the show, saying it was \\"unspectacular\\" and \\"instantly forgettable\\" and felt that Mars' youth and unlengthy repertoire failed to give him the legacy of previous halftime performers. Chase and Strauss stated the performance was \\"acceptable\\" however that it would not be remembered. Red Hot Chili Peppers controversy Some complaints, including some from fellow musicians, were directed towards Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and guitarist Josh Klinghoffer who appeared to not have wires connected to their instruments and were accused of faking their performance. A few days following the Super Bowl, Flea responded through the band's website by saying: Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith also responded to the controversy through his Twitter page saying: \\"FYI.... Every band in the last 10 years at the Super Bowl has performed to a previously recorded track. It's the NFL's policy. Period.\\" Some fans even complained to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) about the band's shirtless appearance saying that they were offended and both men and women should wear clothing because children were watching. One person even contacted the FCC complaining sexism and how it was unfair for the Chili Peppers to go topless but Janet Jackson's exposed nipple caused so much backlash. Ratings The Super Bowl XLVIII halftime show was once the most watched in the history of the Super Bowl drawing record ratings of 115.3 million viewers, passing the record 114 million who watched Madonna perform two years earlier. This was surpassed by Katy Perry in 2015. However, that number was significantly higher than the 98.88 million viewers reported in the overnight ratings from Nielsen that measure the top 56 markets. Media On February 3, 2014 Billboard predicted that retailers had sold Unorthodox Jukebox 40,000 copies in the week ending February 2, representing a 164% gain compared to the previous week, when it sold 15,000, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Despite this effect, the album was already aiming for around 19,000 copies sold in the week ending February 2, thanks in part to Mars' exposure at the 2014 Grammy Awards. Mars was presented the award for best pop vocal album on the Grammys and got additional screen time from his nominations in other categories as record of the year and song of the year. The author of the article added that \\"the impact of the Super Bowl on Mars' music sales, and on the Billboard charts, will be unique compared to all other halftime headliners in the modern era of Super Bowl halftime entertainment\\". On the following week it was expect that Unorthodox Jukebox would sell 70,000 to 80,000 copies by the end of the tracking week, coming for the top three on next week's Billboard 200 chart, while his debut album, Doo-Wops & Hooligans, was expected sell around 25,000 copies. Regarding the tickets sales of his worldwide tour, The Moonshine Jungle Tour, Mars became the fastest entertainer to sell out three concerts at the Blaisdell Arena, in Hawaii. Since the morning of February 3, 2014, the average price for The Moonshine Jungle Tour went up $150 to an average price of $500. Despite existence of some tickets left on the primary market for select shows, many were sold out. Ticketmaster also struggled to keep with demand, having to switch from their interactive seating maps for most events. The price for tickets on the primary market ranges from $49‚Äì$100 for most shows. Bigger city shows prices range from $70 to $181. For shows at big venues, the average prices on the secondary market is north of $600 with the cheapest tickets going for $150. At these prices, Mars upcoming tour ranks amongst the most expensive in the country this summer, ahead of One Direction tickets and Jason Aldean tickets, which were two of the highest prices for an American tours during the spring and summer of 2014.

He wrote many gardening books until retiring in 1936. Cowley was a member of the Kew Guild and active in the Kew Guild for Old Kewites, former and serving Kew Gardens staff. He also edited the Kew Guild Journal. After four years as journal editor or sub-editor from 1909 to 1914 and military service from 1914 to 1915, he became editor of The Garden in 1915/16 and carried on as a gardening writer until around 1936. Early life His father Henry Cowley (died 3 April 1930 at Easton, Portland, Dorset) was a \\"domestic gardener\\" on Census records. Father Henry and mother Mary Ann Cowley are listed as living in Wantage, Berkshire, in the 1920s. Herbert worked at Lockinge Gardens in Berkshire before studying at Swanley College for two years, one of the last eight male students before it became a female horticultural college around 1902. He worked for the royal garden at Frogmore and after Swanley for the famous nursery family of Veitch's at Feltham. Cowley joined the staff of Kew Gardens, eventually settling in the Orchid department in 1905. He was involved in Kew's Mutual Improvement Lectures in the 1906/07 season. Sadly, this pre-war lecture lists contain the names of some of other Kew staff including C. F. Ball, who would soon be killed on active service. His Kew Guild Journal obituary in 1968 mentions prewar plant hunting trips to the Dolomites and a notable visit to Bulgaria as a guest of King Ferdinand, in the company of Kew contemporary C. F. Ball of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Glasnevin, in Dublin. Ball was killed as a Private in the Royal Dublin Fusiliers on 13 September 1915 as part of the Gallipoli campaign. Ball's obituary in The Garden was written by his Kew contemporary and editor friend Cowley. Cowley left Kew around 1907 to join The Gardener magazine as a subeditor (later called Popular Gardening). Herbert Cowley became Assistant Editor or Sub-Editor at a different title, The Garden in 1910. This was the magazine he was to return to as Editor after military service in 1915/6 until c. 1926. Cowley then edited Gardening Illustrated from 1923 to 1926. He appears also to have written garden articles for Country Life after 1911. He also worked (probably in the late 1920s) for Wallace & Co of Tunbridge Wells, nursery-men and landscape architects. He wrote his final book The Garden Year at Tunbridge Wells in 1936. Military service and family casualties WW1 Herbert Cowley's army records reveal that he enlisted early in the war on 7 September 1914 as No. 2477 in the 12th County of London Regiment, known as the \\"London Rangers\\" or \\"Polytechnic Corps\\". He had quickly embarked for Belgium by 25 December 1914. In one of Herbert Cowley's postwar letters in his National Archives British Army Service records, he complains to the Army authorities in 1920 from his residence at Curley Croft, Lightwater, near Bagshot: > \\"I have received so far no medals whatsover for services rendered at the > Front in 1914/15. I was in the 12th London Regiment and went to Belgium with > the 1st Battalion on Christmas Eve.\\" Cowley would eventually be awarded the Pip, Squeak and Wilfred trio of medals for soldiers who served early in the First World War. He was also awarded the Silver War Badge by 1916, a useful public symbol that showed others he had been injured and demobilised. Cowley had got what was known as a \\"Blighty\\" wound, serious enough to get him invalided out of the army but one that allowed him to live an active life. \\"Our Sub-Editor at the Front\\", Cowley is recorded in the 1916 Kew Guild Journal as being \\"wounded twice\\" in the spring battles of Ypres in 1915. He was slightly wounded in late April 1915, reported in The Garden of 8 May 1915: > \\"For the past eight days we have been in severe battle. I am slightly > wounded by shell - only a bruised rib and am in hospital. Dreadful warfare > is still raging ... we must win!\\" He was more seriously wounded on 4 May 1915, receiving a GSW Right Knee (either gunshot wound or shrapnel wound). The circumstances are reported in The Garden on 15 May 1915: > \\"Rifleman H. Cowley 2477,... has again been wounded in action and is now in > hospital ... Surgical 7, 3rd Southern General Hospital , Oxford ... wounded > in the knee whilst bandaging another soldier in the trenches ...\\" Cowley was lucky to be alive, if injured, after this action at Ypres. The fighting by his 1st Battalion, 12th London Regiment on the Frezenberg Ridge in the Second Battle Of Ypres \\"brought about the end of the original battalion\\", only 53 of his original battalion comrades survived unscathed. This battalion had also been involved in the first German poison gas attack on 22 April 1915. His family were also affected by the war. Herbert's older brother Lance Corporal Henry William Cowley died while training on military service in the 26th Reserve Training Battalion died of a cerebral haemorrhage on 14 September 1917 at Napsbury Hospital, St Albans, leaving a wife and three children.\\"Lance Corporal Cowley, Henry William\\" at CWGC. His other brother Charles Cowley (b. 1890, Wantage, Berks - d. 1973, New Zealand) served in the same regiment as Cowley from 1915 and became a Sergeant, invalided out with trench foot to become a musketry instructor in Devon. His wife Elsie Mabel (n√©e Hurst) lost her 30-year-old brother Rifleman 4278 Percy Haslewood (or Hazlewood) Hurst of the 1st /16th Battalion, London Regiment (Queen's Westminster Rifles), who was killed on 1 July 1916, the first day of Battle of the Somme, during his battalion's diversionary attack on Gommecourt. Life after military service In late 1915 Cowley was invalided out of the Army, recovering from wounds and married Elsie Mabel Hurst on 8 December 1915 in Kingston, Surrey. Cowley very quickly returned his gardening and writing work to produce many books of practical, no-nonsense advice for the gardening enthusiast, Vegetable Growing in Wartime 1917, in his own way helping the war effort in the First World War's version of Dig for Victory. The tone of his editorials in The Garden was increasingly about the need for practical food production. Bad harvests and the increasing German submarine attacks on merchant shipping were causing shortages, price rises and uncertainty over future supply. Rationing was introduced in Britain in late 1917. Herbert Cowley continued to practical small pamphlets on Storing Vegetables and Fruit (1918), Cultivation with Movable Frames (1920) and a short book on The Modern Rock Garden (still in print). His largest book, The Garden Year appeared in 1936, when his garden journalism career appears to end. Cowley was still energetically going abroad in his fifties, despite his shrapnel wounds, leading trips to the Swiss Alps in 1936. Alpine plants were to remain a passion of Herbert Cowley to the end of his life in 1968. He was an honorary life member of the British Alpine Society.  Friendship with Gertrude Jekyll  Many of the famous postwar photographs of Miss Gertrude Jekyll and Jekyll's Munstead Wood are attributed to Cowley.* Cowley had a long working relationship with Gertrude Jekyll, to whom she records her thanks in A Gardening Companion:The Gardening Companion, Gertrude Jekyll > \\"and lastly to her devoted friend and colleague, Mr. Herbert Cowley, editor > of The Gardening Illustrated during the period of her contribution to it, > for many of the photographs which materially enhance such value as this book > may possess.\\"  Life during and after WW2  According to an obituary article in the Western Guardian on 9 November 1967, Cowley left journalism c. 1936 to 1940 to move to Withypool on Exmoor to run a riding school for 20 years up to the late 1950s. Cowley and his wife made a final move to the Brixham area in the early 1960s, growing camellias, nerines and alpine plants. His Kew Guild Journal 1968 obituary notes that he was survived by his wife Elsie (b. 1893? ‚Äì d. 1969) and a son. Herbert's unexpected move to the West Country and retirement from journalism may be explained by a sad wartime event in late 1940. It appears that one other of his sons, RAF Sergeant Observer Robert Hurst Cowley, 580643, died aged 22 on 2 September 1940 flying with 57 Squadron on Blenheim bombers on anti-shipping patrols over the North Sea from its base in Elgin in Scotland. Robert is listed on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) website as the \\"son of Herbert & Elsie Mabel Cowley of East Grinstead, Sussex\\".\\"Sergeant Cowley, Robert Hurst\\" at CWGC. Robert Hurst Cowley has no known grave and is commemorated on panel 13 of the Runnymede Memorial to missing aircrew. Robert is also listed on the St. Thomas a Becket Church, Framfield, on the War Memorial as \\"of this parish\\".

He worked as a correspondent in Buenos Aires, Paris, Madrid, London, Berlin, Washington DC, and Geneva, and traveled to Italy, Russia, and Austria, among others. As a correspondent, he collaborated principally with Catalan media outlets, writing in Catalan, like La Publicitat, La Veu de Catalunya, or Mirador magazine, which he complemented with activities in Spanish in South American publications and the Madrid-based newspaper Ahora. His mastery of languages allowed him to work as a translator for international organizations like the UN, WHO, World Bank, and FAO. His longest assignment was in Berlin, between 1922 and 1936, during the Weimar Republic, when Xammar published in 1923 an alleged interview of Hitler, the first known such of the future F√ºhrer, in which he explains how he was incubating what he called \\"the serpent's egg\\". Eighty years later, the authenticity of this interview was called into question by Llu√≠s Permanyer and Albert S√°nchez Pi√±ol. These are the years in which he coincided with Josep Pla who was also a correspondent and with whom he maintained a lifelong friendship. From Berlin, he narrated the repercussions of the First World War on the German populace that led to the evolution of Nazism and Hitler's arrival to power. Always committed to the Republic and to the Government of the Generalitat de Catalunya, of which he was a representative in Paris during the postwar period under President Irla, his actions led to Francoist reprisals and extradition, as well as the disappearance of his name and his work for an entire generation of students until his posthumous memoir was published in the mid 1970s. Xammar defined himself as a democrat, Republican, and Catalanist. He stated: \\"when it comes to Catalonia, I have never taken precautions\\". He was very critical of those who, despite sharing positions like his own, considered themselves \\"non- belligerents\\" with the postwar Francoist regime, like for example the intellectuals who contributed to Destino magazine, despite it being a key liberal, Catalanist, democratic source of the times.  Biography  Although he was born in Barcelona, in 1900 he moved with his mother and his brother Josep Maria to the Can Xammar de Dalt manor house in Almetlla del Vall√®s. The property, which had been the third most important one in the municipality, had fallen into ruin due to Phylloxera, when his mother, the widow of Ramon Xammar, inherited it. His mother tried to save the mostly rural property, renting rooms to Barcelonians who spent summers outside of the city, and the custom became widespread and turned Almetlla into a summer resort during the first third of the 20th century. But it was not enough, and two years after arriving, the still adolescent Eugeni Xammar had to decide whether to accept the challenge suggested by his mother of becoming a farmer and continuing the family business. His restless temperament kept him from any kind of farm- related vocation, and he answered that \\"whether farming or managing a farm, living in Ametlla for my whole life doesn't appeal to me in the slightest\\". When he was 14, his mother told him they would finish the winter in Ametlla and then work in Barcelona, in the cotton business Sucesores de B. Brutau. Four years later, his mother was forced to sell the farm at a loss to another cotton industrialist, Joan Millet i Pag√®s, brother of the director of the Orfe√≥ Catal√†, Llu√≠s Millet. From that moment on, the property was rebaptized with the name Can Millet. This was not the only change, since the new owner hired the modernist architect in fashion in the area, Manuel Joaquim Raspall, to remodel the place. Xammar was flabbergasted when he saw the new look, and he wrote, \\"A touch of Raspall‚Äîto call it that‚Äîwas all that was needed to transform a magnificent, gigantic farmhouse, with two sides, into a sort of inedible Easter Egg that to this day still frightens any sensible person.\\" In August 1909, he took advantage of the 1500 pesetas that his aunt had given him to pay to get out of his military service in order to take a trip to Paris to polish his French while he took on all manner of jobs in order to survive. It's not clear whether he went to make a break with the environment of Barcelona during the Tragic Week of 1909, that he was already reflecting upon in his columns in El Poble Catal√†, or if it was to get out of doing military service. He returned from Paris, passing quickly through Catalonia, before heading on to Argentina, a country that he found distressing and that he left three months later to go back to Paris where he lived for two years, between 1910 and 1912, living a Bohemian life. Next he began work as a newspaper correspondent that led him to live in various countries without returning to Barcelona until 1917, due to his mother having a serious illness, which kept him in Barcelona until 1918. Between 1918 and 1936, he lived in Paris, Madrid, Geneva, and Berlin. Marriages At the end of 1922 in Berlin, Xammar married Amanda F√ºrstenwerth Goetsche, a cultured German woman with whom he lived until her death in 1969, after an operation on her femur. In the last years of their marriage, Xammar had a French lover 40 years his junior, Francine Mesne, employed by the UNESCO in Paris, who became his second wife on May 2, 1970 in Santa Maria de Llerona (Vall√®s Oriental). His few friends attended the wedding, including Josep Badia and the musician Josep Maria Ruera i Pinart, who played the Catalan Anthem, Els Segadors, at the doors of the church. The pair made their home in Paris, but just a few months later, Xammar's health deteriorated due to a violent attack of Zoster Herpes that evolved into long, aching pain between his ribs. After a few months, on February 22, 1971, he tripped and broke his femur. He was operated on in Paris at the age of 83, and his wife Francine, unwilling to take care of an old man, sent him to his home in Ametlla. She stayed in Paris and visited him on a few occasions before his death. Last years in Ametlla Despite the short stay during his youth in Ametlla del Vall√®s, Xammar always returned to the town when he was passing through Catalonia. He was always clear that he wanted to end up in the town in which he had refused to be a farmer, and which would have limited his freedom of movement. He thought, however, that he would fulfill that objective after a few years of globetrotting, like his friend Josep Pla explained to him in a letter at the end of the 1920s: \\"However closed the paths may seem, I have the impression that in three years at the most, things will have changed and we will meet once again in Catalonia. I think I'll be able to save 12,000 marks this year that I can devote to buying land in Ametlla‚Äîand I confess the fact that I'm starting to miss it. Next year, I want to return to Catalonia no matter what, paying off my military service beforehand, of course, if I could stay, I would stay.\\" Even though he didn't have his own house, he took advantage of any opportunity of talking up the town, like in 1931 when he brought the Civil Governor from the new Republican government, Carlos Espl√°, accompanied by the journalist Francisco Madrid on an excursion to Ametlla. His dreams didn't come true until 1932, the year in which he bought Can Feliu, with a small house and a little bit of land, on the edge of the town limits. The purchase coincided with the beginning of the Republic, a fact that Xammar underscores when he describes the house in his memoirs. The text describes a property of a limited size, a small house almost in ruins, and ends up showing his desire to return, despite all of that: \\"But all of that was nothing compared to becoming once again a property owner in Ametlla del Vall√®s and a resident in the town where he had to pay taxes (few) and gotten to vote when the elections came around.\\" From that moment on, he began to visit Catalonia more frequently and began to recover some of his friends from his youth. At the beginning of the civil war, he was in Berlin and in October, 1940, a Barcelona judge ordered the 'confiscation of all the goods and the perpetual estrangement from national territory of Mr. Eugenio Xammar for being a red and a Catalanist'. This event condemned him to a long exile up until 1950 and the loss of his beloved house in Catalonia. Years later, F√®lix Millet i Maristany, the new owner of Can Xammar de Dalt, helped him get it back. After 1960, Xammar's life basically was centered in Ametlla in a kind of internal exile, refusing to write as a badge of loyalty to an imprisoned Catalonia. It is a period in which he alternates between stays in Fonda Europa in Granollers, which belonged to the Parellada family, with which he maintained a great friendship. Many of his peers, including Jaume Miravitlles or Avel¬∑l√≠ Art√≠s- Gener, visited his house in recognition of his professional prowess and the exemplariness of his ideological independence. His last years were characterized by his fight against the herpes-which caused pain and restricted his mobility. As he described it in his memoir, 'Each day I was less and less motivated to move, especially in the winter, I come and go from a very comfortable bed to a very comfortable seat and from a spacious bedroom to an ample bathroom.' His finances had always been limited, but during his last years he had serious economic problems. Once again it was Josep Badia who helped him by finding a local gentleman, Maties Barres, who gave him a lifelong pension for his house, Can Feliu, and with that, he was able to live out his last days. He died in Ametlla del Vall√®s, where he is buried, on December 5, 1973. Career Xammar's concern for broadening his knowledge from his basic studies drove him to educate himself. When he returned to Barcelona to work in the textile industry, he joined the CADCI. While he improved his studies, he read the classics, wrote poetry, practiced his favorite sport‚Äîsoccer‚Äîbecame an expert at billiards and played Basque pelota. He combined attendance at concerts at the Liceu with his participation as a member on the jury of the Jocs Florals de Rub√≠, or with the composition of a poem that would become the words to 'Nocturn musicat' by the founder of the Orfe√≥ Gracienc, Joan Balcells. The piece was performed for the first time by Balcells himself at the Palau de la M√∫sica in 1949. It is at the CADCI where he received his formation at a moment in which Catalonia struggled to make education one of the country's foundations. Xammar understood and tied Catalanism to education and in one of his articles titled 'Catalan education' (La Tralla, October 1, 1904), he demanded nationalist formation, criticizing the universities, 'ruled by professors, the cleverest of which wasn't smartest enough to pull a cart' and he demanded the creation of Catalan schools in order to 'marginalize the vulgar Spanish primary education that we have'.

Overview The first studio album released by the Radioactive Chicken Heads following their name change from Joe and the Chicken Heads in 2004, Growing Mold also marked a change in sound from the band's early ska punk influences into more eclectic and experimental territory incorporating rock, punk, new wave, blues and country, a combination of styles which (un)Leash magazine described as \\"like early Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo meets Dead Kennedys meets gothabilly monster mash\\". Growing Molds low-key independent release flew under the radar of major music publications, but critical response from zines, university papers and alternative weeklies was largely positive. Of the more notable reviews, UC Riversides Highlander called the Chicken Heads \\"one of the best bands you've probably never heard of\\", praising the \\"delightfully eclectic\\" album's \\"sly, quirky humor\\" and \\"off-the-wall style\\". The OC Weekly, however, offered a more ambivalent opinion, noting that while the lyrics were \\"funny\\" and \\"the sonic nods to...sci-fi movie soundtracks are amusingly campy\\", the Chicken Heads \\"are a band that's best swallowed live\\" and that studio recordings \\"can never grasp the entire C-Head experience\\". Although Growing Mold didn't receive any conventional radio airplay, \\"I Eat Kids\\", a cowpunk cover of a 1978 song by offbeat children's musician Barry Louis Polisar, was selected to air on the nationally syndicated novelty song showcase The Dr. Demento Show in July 2005. In November 2006, the Chicken Heads appeared on an episode of The Tyra Banks Show, performing \\"Our Last Song\\" as part of a talent show-themed episode which featured intentionally weird and unusual acts. The band ultimately lost their set to John the Running Painter, a painter on a treadmill, by an audience vote of 73% to 27%. \\"Pest Control\\" and \\"I Eat Kids\\" were later re-recorded and \\"I Looked into the Mirror (What Did the Mirror Say?)\\", was remixed for the Chicken Heads' 2008 album Music for Mutants, each of which received music videos.

History and architecture The imposing building located at No. 25 Domshof was designed by Wilhelm Martens (1842‚Äì1910) from Berlin and the Bremen architect Friedrich Wilhelm Rauschenberg (1853‚Äì1935). The building was for the Deutsche Bank which had been founded in 1870 in Berlin with a major aim of supporting foreign trade with Germany. The bank's building is built in red sandstone from the Main Valley in a currently popular Historicist style derived from Italian 16th-century practice, in which colossal Ionic pilasters link two main floors above a high rusticated basement storey; the expanded central entrance bay is pedimented and the end bays are slightly emphasized and lightly projecting. Martens, the house architect of Deutsche Bank, Berlin, was considered a specialist in bank design. He also drew up plans for the Sparkasse building on Bremen's Am Brill which was completed in 1906. Rauchenberg, who above all was responsible for overseeing the actual construction of the building, is remembered for his many residential and commercial buildings in the city, mainly designed in the Neo-Renaissance style. The Deutsche Bank am Domshof has been a listed building since 1981. In connection with the construction of the Domshof Passage from 1996 to 1999, the bank building was modernized by the Bremen architects Harm Haslob, Peter Hartlich and Jens Kruse. The passage is a shopping arcade with sixteen shops which allows visitors to travel to the Katherinenpassage which was built less than ten years before. The building faces the Domshof, the market square, in Bremen and just in front of the bank is a sculpture based on a model of the world.

There is another subject the poet touched upon: a lack of confidence that leads to disaster and the poet comments that one must recognise one's own capabilities and should not try to emulate others.Evergreen Publications, A collection of poems, the poem also deals with suspected emotions in different method by Michael Shane Calvert, p-58 The poem is targeted at a young audience and teaches how to keep clear of cunning people who can exploit one's talents to their benefit. The use of animal characters in the poem is to appeal to a younger audience. The main characters are the frog and the nightingale, where the frog represents the cunning capitalist mind and the nightingale a vulnerable artist. The arrogant frog has been ruling the bog and torturing its residents with his cacophonous singing. The arrival of the nightingale and her singing provides the creatures in the bog a pleasant break who admire her sweet voice. The frog approaches her and appreciates her like a critic making her feeling flattered. He manipulates her making her sing for him in a concert and earns money by selling tickets. The poor creature does not know how she is being manipulated by the frog and sings till she has lost her voice and health. The frog pushes her to the verge where her health and energy fail her and she dies. The poem leaves behind a lesson that while it is good to be talented one must also watch one's weaknesses and instead of feeling flattered must cautiously tread one's way towards one's target. The nightingale was vulnerable to flattery and fell victim to the frog's manipulation.

Early life In≈üirah Hanƒ±m was born on 10 July 1887 in Ma≈üukiye, ƒ∞zmit. Born as Seniye Vo√ßibe, she was a member of Ubykh noble family, Vo√ßibe. Her father was Aziz Bey Vo√ßibe. She had an elder brother named Zeki Bey (1885 ‚Äì 1932). She was the paternal niece of D√ºrr√ºaden Kadƒ±n, wife of Sultan Mehmed V. She was taken into palace by her aunt D√ºrr√ºaden. At the age of sixteen, she became a lady-in-waiting to ≈ûayeste Hanƒ±m, wife of Sultan Abdulmejid I. She was tall, had slender figure, long chestnut hair, and faint blue eyes. She was interested in painting. Marriage One day, when Mehmed was in his forties, he visited his adoptive mother ≈ûayeste Hanƒ±m at her palace. Here he saw In≈üirah, then seventeen years old, and fell in love with her. He asked ≈ûayeste to give him In≈üirah in marriage. In≈üirah refused to this proposal. However, at her brother's insistence, she agreed. The marriage took place on 8 July 1905 in the √áengelk√∂y Palace. No issue came of this marriage. After her marriage, her brother, Zeki Bey became aide-de-camp to Mehmed. In≈üirah was said to be a jealous lady. One day, she caught Mehmed in the bedroom with a servant girl named Periru. She immediately abandoned him, and went back to her family. Mehmed divorced her on 17 November 1909. Later years and death After her divorce, she moved in her aunt's Validebaƒüƒ± Palace. When the imperial family went into exile in 1924, she went to Cairo. Her brother, however, remained with Mehmed, even after her divorce, and followed him into exile. In Cairo she was miserable, and thought of going to Sanremo, where Mehmed now lived. Her brother Zeki Bey refused to let her meet her former husband. After much crying from her part, he told her: \\"Go back where you came from, what are you doing here? You left this man before, you have no right to ask for his help.\\" He gave her a pouch of money, set her up in a hotel room and then sent her to Cairo the following day. Mehmed never found out that his former wife had been in Sanremo. Back in Cairo, In≈üirah became even more unhappy, and attempted suicide, but her lady-in-waiting Zernig√ºl Hanƒ±m was able to save her. But the situation did not improve; she couldn't stand her life anymore, and threw herself in the Nile on 10 June 1930, and drowned. Her family brought her body back to Istanbul and buried her in the Ey√ºp cemetery.

The party was led by A. Nesamony.  History  The Kingdom of Travancore was a princely state of India. Its population included an ethnic Malayali majority and a Tamil minority; the later suffered linguistic discrimination in education, and leaders of Tamil organisations expressed concern about disadvantage from lack of economic development. The Tamil minority formed several political parties, one of them being Travancore Tamil Nadu Congress. The party's original platform was the formation of a separate Tamil state within Travancore. The party contested the first Travancore constituent assembly election in 1948 and won 14 seats in the 120-seat legislature. In 1949, as part of the integration of India, Kingdom of Travancore merged with Kingdom of Cochin, another princely state, to form Travancore-Cochin. Rajpramukh became the Governor. The Travancore Tamil Nadu Congress party won 9 or 10 seats in the first Travancore-Cochin assembly election. In the assembly, it supported the Indian National Congress to form a ruling coalition. It withdrew this support after 19 months because of differences with Congress over policy regarding Tamil-speaking parts of the state. In the second assembly election in 1954, TTNC won 12 seats. In the same year, TTNC called for the merger of Tamil-dominated taluks such as Thovalai, Agasteeswaram, Kalkulam, Vilavancode, Neyyatinkara, Shenkottai, Devikulam and Peerumadu with Madras state. In August 1954, a street protest organised by the TTNC in support of these mergers took a violent turn. Police attempting to maintain control opened fire on protesters. Four people were killed and about a dozen sustained injuries. Following the recommendations of the States Reorganisation Commission, the States Reorganisation Act, 1956 restructured Indian regional jurisdictions. In this process, some Tamil regions (present day Kanyakumari district) of Travancore-Cochin merged with Madras state (present day Tamil Nadu) on 1 November 1956. Other Tamil-majority areas remained in Travancore‚ÄìCochin, including Neyyatinkkara South, Nedumangad East, Devikulam and Peerumedu. Following this reorganisation, the Travancore Tamil Nadu Congress successfully fielded a candidate in the Travancore‚ÄìCochin state election; once in the Assembly, he lobbied for amalgamation of further Tamil areas into the Tamil Nadu state. After the merger of the regions, the leaders dissolved the party in 1957 and joined the ruling Congress party.

It is based on the Planetary Dispositor Principle. According to Parasara, PƒÅrijƒÅta yoga arises if the lord of the sign occupied by the lord of the Lagna (Ascendant) and the lord of the sign occupied by the dispositor of the lord of the lagna both, or if the lords of the navamsas occupied by these two lords are situated in a kendra or a trikona from the lagna-kendra in their own or exaltation signs. The Sanskrit word pƒÅrijƒÅta means \\"fragrance\\" or \\"night-flowering jasmine (Nyctanthes arbor-tristis).\\" Summary PƒÅrijƒÅta yoga is not a commonly occurring yoga, and in practice seen to occur alongside other favourable or unfavourable yogas. Parasara states that the person blessed with PƒÅrijƒÅta yoga will be fond of battles (i.e. strong-willed, full of determination, fearless, adept and successful), kind-hearted, forgiving and generous, has faith in Dharma and Karmas, a proud possessor and enjoyer of wealth and comforts and the one who leads a royal life during his or her middle and last part of life. PƒÅrijƒÅta yoga is an improved variation of Parvata yoga and Kahala yoga combined per first-half of Parasara‚Äôs description. Mantreswara in his Phaladeepika states that Parvata yoga arises if the lord of the sign occupied by the Lord of the Lagna is situated in its own sign or in its sign of exaltation in a kendrasthana or a trikonasthana, and KƒÅhala yoga arises if the dispositor of the lord of the sign occupied by the Lagna-lord is similarly placed. Parvata yoga gives everlasting happiness and excellent comforts, good conduct and deeds, and a kingdom to rule; Kahala yoga makes lead a good life, noble, kind and benevolent. PƒÅrijƒÅta or SupƒÅrijƒÅta yoga is mentioned in Chapter VI Sloka 44 & 55 as the 11th (i.e. basically involving the lord of the 11th house) of the twelve yogas that have been specifically named as resulting from the bhavas being occupied or aspected by benefics, their lords occupying good houses or being brilliant and in their exaltation or own sign. With any one of these three yogas occurring at the time of birth, then, as Janardan Harji in his Mansagari states Raja yoga results will certainly be experienced if the Shadavarga-wise strong lord of the lagna is in a kendra or a trikona or in the 11th house from a beneficially disposed lagna-kendra. Benefic planets situated in the 11th house or aspecting the 11th house give wealth earned or obtained through right and honest means, malefic planets similarly situated give wealth through illegal, unfair and dishonest means more often by causing pain or loss to others; if a benefic and a malefic planet conjoin in the 11th house or aspect that house then wealth is usually gained through fair and unfair means. If the lord of the 11th house not being combust occupies its own sign or exaltation sign in a gainful (auspicious) bhava and the 11th house is also aspected or occupied by a benefic planet then the very favourable SupƒÅrijƒÅta or PƒÅrijƒÅta yoga as mentioned in Phaladeepika arises, the person will be wealthy, prosperous and successful. But, if the lord of the 11th house occupies a trikabhava, and malefic planets occupy or aspect the 11th house then a Daridra yoga will arise and the person will suffer losses, contract debts and experience difficulties, unhappiness and poverty; moreover, the lord of the 11th house in conjunction with another papa-graha does not produce good results. SupƒÅrijƒÅta yoga will arise if the Moon is exalted in the 9th house and Venus or Mercury or Jupiter occupies the 11th house. According to Sata Yoga Manjari, PƒÅrijƒÅta yoga arises if the dispositor of the lord of the 9th house is exalted and the lord of the lagna occupies a kendrasthana in conjunction with a benefic planet. Notable personalities=Adolf Hitler The Ruchaka yoga, Panch Mahapurusha yoga caused by Mars, in the 7th house from Libra lagna aspected by its lord, in the case of Adolf Hitler though marred by the presence of the Sun did give rise to the PƒÅrijƒÅta yoga but the Raja yoga effects did not last for very long because of Saturn in mutual aspect with Mars occupying the 10th house gave Hitler a spectacular rise and also an equally disgraceful fall from power. Gautama Buddha Gautama Buddha was blessed with PƒÅrijƒÅta yoga. At the time of his birth, the lord of the lagna, Moon, was in Libra in the 4th house from the lagna. Its dispositor, Venus, occupied the 10th house ruled by Mars. Venus was in its own navamsa, Taurus, and Mars in its exaltation navamsa, Capricorn. At the same time there was the occurrence of Pasa yoga that made him an ascetic, and of the Sanyasa yoga caused by five planets conjoining in the 10th house from Cancer lagna. The exalted Sun situated in the karmasthana as a constituent of the Sanyasa yoga made Buddha possess a strong Atman-shakti, he transformed the Vedic concept of the Triune-unity into Nirvana.

These buildings show the quality and architectural design of that time. These buildings serve as benchmarks of architecture, style and stability. A brief description of some of these buildings and structures is given below:  Wadudia Hall  Wadudia Hall is located in Saidu Sharif opposite to Jahanzeb College. The hall was built by the last WƒÅli of Swat in the name of his father, Miangul Abdul Wadud, in 1969. Wadudia Hall was constructed to provide an appropriate conference hall for the communities of the entire region. It is still in use and is probably the most characteristic building of Swat region. The building's rectangular floor plan is composed of front and back blocks. The front block is divided into two levels, with the third level on the left side added at a later date. The hall is used for all major events in Swat. Pakistani prime ministers, presidents, governors, Army officers, and foreign ambassadors attend conferences and seminars at the hall from time to time.  White Palace  The White Palace is located 7000 feet above sea level in Marghazar, 13 kilometers from Saidu Sharif. The Palace was built in 1940 by the first WƒÅli of Swat, Miangul Abdul Wadud. The name was given to the palace as it is made of white marble. The palace now serves as a tourist resort and becomes a tourist attraction in the summer. Maj (r) Hasan Raza Awan has presented the White Palace in a unique style through his photography and is planning to hold an exhibition in Swat in the coming months.  Royal Palace Saidu Sharif  Royal Palace was built by the first WƒÅli of Swat in 1930 in Saidu Sharif in the midst of . The palace is a showpiece of Mughal architecture. After the death of the WƒÅli of Swat, the palace was converted into a hotel, and was later converted into a school (Iqraa Academy Swat)  Palace of the last WƒÅli of Swat  The palace of the Last WƒÅli of Swat is located in the heart of Saidu Sharif. This building was the residence of the last WƒÅli of Swat and his sons. The building consists of the courtyard, houses, guest house, visitors book, and a lawn. It is a piece of the splendid architectural design of the Swati culture. Glimpses of European and Mughal architecture are also seen in the building.  Tomb of Akhund of Swat  The Tomb of Akhund of Swat is one of the characteristic buildings of the Swat State. Akhund of Swat's grandson Miangul Abdul Wadud constructed it. The shrine of Akhund of Swat is housed in the marble courtyard of a mosque in Saidu Sharif. Saidu is Sharif (holy) because of the shrine of the Akhund of Swat.  Saidu Baba Mosque  The Saidu Baba (Akhund of Swat) Mosque was constructed near the tomb of Akhund of Swat. The building has two big and two small minarets on each side with a large in between the minarets. The floor of the mosque is covered with white marble. The pillars and roof are decorated with wooden carving. The building is a classic example of Islamic architecture.  Mausoleum of Badshah Sahib  The tomb of Miangul Abdul Wadud (Badshah Sahib) was built by his son Miangul Jahan Zeb in 1975. It is located on Jail Road, Saidu Sharif.  The Central Hospital  The Central Hospital, located opposite to Allho Akbar mosque, was built by Miangul Abdul Wadud (WƒÅli of Swat) in 1927. The building consists of a dispensary, dressing room and two small wards for male and female patients. The building is in good condition and still in use.  Saidu Hospital  Saidu Hospital was founded in the capital of the state, Saidu Sharif, in 1954, mainly for female patients called Zanana Hospital. Later, the hospital was extended and a 15-bed children's hospital was added in 1958. This hospital has now become the 5th largest hospital in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.  Allah-o -Akbar Mosque  This mosque is located on the main Saidu Sharif road opposite to the Central Hospital, Saidu Sharif. The Allaho Akbar Mosque was constructed in Saidu Sharif in 1944, during the last years of Badshah Sahib's (Miangul Abdul Wadud's) rule. The mosque is an excellent example of Islamic religious architecture and is still in use. The facade is characterized by a veranda, marked with three powerful pillars topped with atlantes on the roof and a minaret on the left side.  Wadudia High School Saidu Sharif  Wadudia High School is the oldest school in Swat. It is the first institute for formal and modern education after 2,000 years of Gandahara. Government Wadudia High School is among Swat‚Äôs first architectural landmarks. The building initially served as the state‚Äôs fort and was later converted into a prison. In 1928, Miangul Abdul Wadud, the state‚Äôs first ruler, converted it into a school. In 1960, the last ruler of Swat State, Miangul Jahanzeb, renewed its building in accordance with modern architecture and renamed it after Miangul Abdul Wadud. Due to the 2005 earthquake in Swat, the school building was partially damaged. The old building was demolished in 2012 and a new building was erected instead in 2013 with the financial assistance of the U.A.E Government.  Swat Serena Hotel  Serena Hotel is located in the center of Saidu Sharif. The main edifice, constructed under the WƒÅli's reign as residence for a , presents an elegant colonial style with refined ornaments in each of its elements, consisting of a verandah and a courtyard with an inlaid wooden arcade. It is situated on six acres of a lush park, where at a later date other blocks in a more modern style were built. Presently, the building is serving as a three star hotel. Hasan Raza Awan from Hafizabad has contributed significantly to reviving the ideas of the hotel's past glories through his photographic promotion of the area and its buildings.  Jahan Zeb College Saidu Sharif  Jahan Zeb College Saidu Sharif is one of the most prestigious institutions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, built by the last WƒÅli of Swat. The Jahan Zeb College was constructed between 1951 and 1954 on the main road that connects Mingora to Saidu Sharif in order to cater to the educational needs of the region. The plan of the building is in the shape of an E (for \\"education\\"). The two main floors were completed in 1951 while the third floor and a separate science block were added later. The building was damaged in the 2005 earthquake, but due to the insistence of the masses to preserve heritage, it was not demolished and is still in use.  Swat Museum  The Swat Museum was built in 1959, halfway between Mingora and Saidu Sharif. The museum contains some of the finest collections of Gandhara art, including magnificent pieces of Buddhist art. Japanese aid has given a facelift to its seven galleries, which now contain an excellent collection of Gandhara sculptures taken from some of the Buddhist sites in Swat, rearranged and labelled to illustrate the Buddha's life story. Terracotta figurines and utensils, beads, precious stones, coins, weapons and various metal objects illustrate daily life in Gandhara. The ethnographic section displays the finest examples of local embroidery, carved wood and tribal jewelry. During the 2005 earthquake and then the 2007 bomb explosions, the museum suffered irreparable damage and the monuments were transferred to the Islamabad Museum. With the cooperation of the Italian mission the building was reconstructed and reopened in 2013. Hasan Raza Awan (from Hafizabad) has promoted the museum through his photography and he carries enormous love for Swat and its people.

Then he started living in the house of Anadinath in Panihati which was in the opposite side of Nilambati, Panihat. At present, it is demolished for the construction of a new apartment.The gymnasium started by Kishori Mohan became the Panihati Club in 1914 and it is still now active as a social organisation. IN 1918 Dr Gopal Chandra Chattopadhyay started a public health movement to control the epidemic of Malaria. Kishori Mohan became his ardent co worker. In 1918, a meeting of the villagers were called at the hall of the Trannath High School of Panihati. There Dr. Gopal Chandra Chattopadhyay established that malaria can be controlled through sanitary conscience of the common people. Anti Malaria Cooperative Society was formed for the first time in village level in India at Panihati on 24 March, 1918 with only 27 people. Dr Gopal Chandra Chattopadhyay was the first President of the organisation while Kishori Mohan Bandopahyay was the first Secretary. Within three monthes by cleaning ponds, drains of the village and removing garbage and spraying Kerosene oil they controlled Malaria . Ir was a deadly disease at that time claiming lives of hundreds every year in the village. This success story encouraged the villagers of the neighborhood and Anti Malaria Cooperative Societies were formed. That movement resulted in the formation of the Central Anti Malaria Cooperative Society in a meeting held on 8 April, 1919 at Rammohan Library Hall in Calcutta. The Central; society got Dr. Kailash Chandra Bose as President and DR. Gopal Chandra Chattopadhyay as Secretary. Kishorimohan continued as the Secretary of the Panihati Society till 1923. He became busy in propagating the message of sanitary conscience throughout undivided Bengal with the help of Magic Lantern.

He is credited for his contributions to the revival of football in the Philippines due to the national team's performance at the 2010 AFF Suzuki Cup. Early life and education Dan Palami was born in Tacloban on June 9, 1970. He studied at the University of the Philippines and pursued a degree in accountancy. Palami became a Certified Public Accountant. He also studied law at the same university but stopped his studies during his fourth year to establish a railway company. Managing career Palami in 2016 Football ;Philippines U19 In November 2009, Palami was offered to handle the Philippine U19 national football team. Palami accepted the offer to manage the team through the 2010 AFC U-19 Championship qualification. He quit after a poor finish at the tournament only gaining a point against Guam. ;Philippines national senior team The Philippine Football Federation hired Dan Palami to be the manager of the Philippine national football team in December 2009. The Philippine Football Federation allowed Palami autonomy over the national football team. Palami was hesitant in accepting the job at first but accepted the offer of the PFF after learning that the next major tournament, the 2010 AFF Championship, was months away, since he had more little time to prepare the U-19 team at the AFC U-19 Championship qualifiers. Palami is in charge of recruiting players and hiring the coach of the team. During the earlier phase of his management he had to fund the team from his own personal funds as the team had difficulties gaining financial support from corporate sponsors. The team's kit sponsor at that time was Mizuno. In March 2018, Palami secured qualification for the Philippines in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup when the national team won, 2‚Äì1, over Tajikistan. ;Philippines national youth teams In late 2017, it was reported that Palami would be involved in managing the Philippine youth teams in 2018. Palami described the setup of the national youth team to the setup of the senior national team in 2010 when there was a lack of developmental plan and transparency on the selection of players. He notes that national youth players are selected from the same schools which their coaches are affiliated with which he says is \\"coincidence at best and justifiable\\" but concedes that it creates doubts due to a lack of transparency on the selection process. Palami is reportedly planning to choose regularly competing players from three pools in Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao for the final line-up of the youth teams. After helping the senior team qualify for their very first Asian Cup, Palami in March 2018 stated that he is considering another role in Philippine football. He said he might get involved in the grassroots of football in the country. Basketball In 2014, he was appointed as the team manager of the UP Fighting Maroons men's basketball team that have played in the UAAP. Sports administration After he graduated and established his own company, Palami and members of his staff began to play at the back of the Quezon City Hall and later at the Sunken Garden at the University of the Philippines. This would lead to the founding of Laos F.C. which later had some success at local tournaments such as the Ang Liga. Palami is also the owner of Global Cebu F.C. since the club's inception. until December 2017, when the club was sold to Alvin Caranzza of MacGraphics Carranz.

Feeding and eating disorders in childhood are often the result of a complex interplay of organic and non-organic factors. Medical conditions, developmental problems and temperament are all strongly correlated with feeding disorders, but important contextual features of the environment and parental behavior have also been found to influence the development of childhood eating disorders. Given the complexity of early childhood eating problems, consideration of both biological and behavioral factors is warranted for diagnosis and treatment. Revisions in the DSM-5 have attempted to improve diagnostic utility for clinicians working with feeding and eating disorder patients. In the DSM-5, diagnostic categories are less defined by age of patient, and guided more by developmental differences in presentation and expression of eating problems. Avoidant/restrictive intake disorder (ARFID)=History Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) was added to the DSM-5 to better clinically describe a subset of eating disorder patients who previously had been diagnosed with eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS), a much broader diagnostic category with less clinical utility. Although more studies need to be conducted, initial studies are validating ARFID as a distinct eating disorder with criteria separate from anorexia (AN) and bulimia (BN). Patients meeting criteria for ARFID typically have a longer history of symptoms prior to diagnosis and an earlier onset than AN or BN patients. They are also more likely to have a co-morbid medical condition or anxiety disorder. Diagnostic criteria An eating or feeding disturbance (e.g., apparent lack of interest in eating or food; avoidance based on sensory characteristics of food; concern about aversive consequences of eating) as manifested by persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs associated with one (or more) of the following: # Significant weight loss (or failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering growth in children). # Significant nutritional deficiency. # Dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements. # Marked interference with psychosocial functioning. The disturbance is not better explained by a lack of available food or by an associated culturally sanctioned practice. The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa, and there is no evidence of a disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced. The eating disturbance is not attributable to a current medical condition or not better explained by another mental disorder. When the eating disturbance occurs in the context of another condition or disorder, the severity of the eating disturbance exceeds that routinely associated with the condition or disorder and warrants additional clinical attention Recent research suggests that patients meeting criteria for ARFID typically have a longer history of symptoms prior to diagnosis, and an earlier onset than AN or BN patients. Selective eating is persistent in ARFID patients, typically beginning in infancy or early childhood. In one recent study, they were also more likely to have a co-morbid medical condition or anxiety disorder, but less likely to have a mood disorder. At present, there is not sufficient evidence that ARFID precedes the development of a later eating disorder. Pica=Diagnostic history Pica is an eating disorder characterized by the ingestion of non-food or non-nutritive substances. The DSM-5 criteria for Pica are as follows: Diagnostic criteria * Persistent eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances over a period of at least 1 month. * The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances is inappropriate to the developmental level of the individual. * The eating behavior is not part of a culturally supported or socially normative practice. * If the eating behavior occurs in the context of another mental disorder (e.g., intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder], autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia) or medical condition (including pregnancy), it is sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical attention. For pica to be considered, the eating of non-food items must be inappropriate to the child's developmental level, with a minimum age of two, and no upper age limit. Pica typically presents in children, but the DSM-5 specifies that it can be diagnosed at any age. Pica is most often a co-morbid condition of children with retardation or developmental disorders, but can also present as a symptom in a broader range of troubled behavior or disorders. For example, pica is sometimes seen in individuals with schizophrenia. Rumination disorder=Diagnostic history Rumination disorder (RD) is an eating disturbance characterized by the regurgitation of partially swallowed or digested food. The following are the DSM-5 criteria for RD: * Repeated regurgitation of food over a period of at least 1 month. Regurgitated food may be re-chewed, re- swallowed, or spit out. * The repeated regurgitation is not attributable to an associated gastrointestinal or other medical condition (e.g., gastroesophageal reflux, pyloric stenosis). * The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. * If the symptoms occur in the context of another mental disorder (e.g., intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder] or another neurodevelopmental disorder), they are sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical attention. Like pica, RD most often occurs in children with mental retardation or developmental disorders. While rumination most often presents in children, the DSM-5 specifies that it can be diagnosed at any age. RD often presents slightly different in older children and adolescents in that they are less likely to re-chew the food that is brought up, and more likely to spit it out. Like pica, rumination may also be a symptom of other disorders. For example, rumination is often a characteristic behavior of individuals with anorexia or bulimia. It has also been correlated with other disorders and symptoms such as anxiety and OCD. Anorexia nervosa=Diagnostic history Anorexia nervosa is characterized by the severe restriction of food intake that results in a significant weight loss. There are two subtypes of anorexia, restricting type and binge-eating/purging type. While historically researchers have found that anorexia typically begins during puberty,=E, Walsh BT: Anorexia nervosa. Am J Psychiatry 164(12):1805‚Äì1810, 2007\\" recent epidemiological studies have found that the average age of onset of anorexia nervosa has moved from the previously from an average age of onset of 13‚Äì17 to a current younger age of onset of 9‚Äì12.Renkl, M. The scary trend of tweens with anorexia. http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/08/08/tweens.anorexia.parenting\\" Among individuals with an eating disorder, 86% report the onset of the eating disorder by age 20, and 43% report the onset between the ages of 16 and 20.6. Corresponding with the age of onset, 95% of the population with current eating disorders are between the ages of 12 and 25.Eating Disorder Statistics. http://www.anad.org/get-information/about-eating-disorders/eating-disorders- statistics/ Diagnostic criteria  Anorexia is characterized by a significant reduction in energy intake which leads to a low body weight given age, sex, development, and physical health considerations. * Individuals with anorexia also experience a significant fear of weight gain or engage in behaviors that interfere with weight gain. * The illness is also characterized by a disturbance in body image, a significant focus and evaluation of self based on body weight, and/or lack of recognition of the consequences and seriousness of the current low body weight. * Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight. Anorexia has two subtypes: the restricting type and the purging type. This is based on whether an individual engages in or does not engage in bingeing and purging behaviors. Anorexia is characterized as mild, moderate, severe, or extreme based on the extent of weight loss. Bulimia nervosa Bulimia nervosa is characterized by episodes of binge eating followed by inappropriate compensatory behaviors. Diagnostic history Similar to anorexia, bulimia typically begins during adolescence, though the average age of onset is somewhat later than that of anorexia. Onset before puberty and after age 40 is atypical.Keel PK, Brown TA: Update on course and outcome in eating disorders. Int J Eat Disord 43(3):195‚Äì204, 2010 Diagnostic criteria Bulimia is characterized by repeated episodes of binge eating followed by the use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors. *The binge eating and compensatory behaviors occur recurrently *An individual experiences a sense of lack of control during the binge eating. *Self evaluation is highly influenced by body image and body perceptions. The disorder can be characterized as mild, moderate, severe, or extreme based on the number of compensatory behaviors per week. Binge eating disorder=Diagnostic history Binge eating disorder was added as an eating disorder diagnosis in DSM-V. Previously individuals with binge eating disorder had been classified under eating disorder not otherwise specified. Due to the recency of the diagnosis, less research is currently available on Binge Eating Disorder compared to the other categories of eating disorders. The average age of onset is reported to be 25 years.Hudson JI, Hiripi E, Pope HG, Kessler RC. The prevalence and correlates of eating disorders in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication. Biological Psychiatry. 2007; 61:348-58. Diagnostic criteria  Binge eating disorder is characterized by repeated binge eating episodes. This includes: *Eating an objectively large amount of food in a short period of time. *Experiencing a sense of lack of control while eating. *Feeling self-deprecating based on eating behavior. The severity is classified by the number of binge eating episodes per week.

The painting was commissioned by the War Artists' Advisory Committee as part of the British war effort in the Second World War. Loftus was a 21-year-old woman who had quickly become an expert in the production of breech rings‚Äîin seven months, rather than the several years it normally took. The painting was commissioned to promote women's work in factories; women dominate the picture, and only one man is visible, in the background. When unveiled at the 1943 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, the painting was extremely popular, and was voted the picture of the exhibition. The image was reproduced in a large-scale poster version by the WAAC for display in factories across the country. Background During the Second World War the British government formed the War Artists' Advisory Committee (WAAC) under the chairmanship of Sir Kenneth Clark, the director of the National Gallery. The committee was \\"to draw up a list of artists qualified to record the war at home and abroad\\". One of those commissioned on several occasions was the British painter Laura Knight, who had painted for the Canadian government during the First World War. Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft gun; the breech is housed at the right-hand side of the weapon Discontent within the factory workforce lead to strikes in the UK in the lead up to January 1943. According to the social research organisation Mass-Observation, women working in war production considered their abilities to be under used, and that potential employees perceived factory girls to be \\"low class, rough, dirty and immoral\\". Women, in particular, were more likely to be absent from work than men, with childcare and running the household the probable reasons, according to the art historian Brian Foss. With a shortage in the number of women working in the factories, the Ministry of Production pushed for the war artists to depict production workers. Knight was commissioned to paint Ruby Loftus in late 1942. She was a machine operator described by the Ministry of Supply as \\"an outstanding factory worker\\". Knight, who was working on A Balloon Site, Coventry, turned down the fee of 75 guineas, negotiating 100 guineas plus expenses; even the higher figure was, she said \\"infinitely lower than I should ask for any other work than that connected to the war\\". Knight offered to accept the 75 guinea fee, but only if it could be painted in the her studio. The WAAC responded that, although they were grateful that she was working at a much lower level of fees than her pre- war rates, the policy was that all work commissioned was \\"on a virtually fixed scale of fees irrespective of the status of the artist\\". The committee added that as Loftus was too valuable to be released from the factory, they would agree to Knight's 100 guinea request; she travelled to Newport, Wales, to paint the portrait in situ over three weeks. The work was completed by the end of March. Loftus and her family moved to South Wales after their home in Golders Green was bombed. She was employed by the Royal Ordnance Factory in Newport (ROF Newport), having previously been an assistant at a tobacconist's shop in Finchley, London. In 1943 she was 21 years old and engaged to John Green, a corporal in the 11th Hussars. Loftus had no prior experience of heavy machinery or the industrial workplace, but she became highly skilled in seven months in making the breech ring of a Bofors anti-aircraft gun. This was the most complex task at ROF Newport and any lack of precision in forming the breech ring could result in the gun being destroyed when fired; the task was normally assigned to a worker with up to nine years' experience. Description Detail showing Loftus's face focusing on her work Ruby Loftus Screwing a Breech-ring is an oil painting on canvas measuring . It is one of the largest pictures of the wartime commissions, and the largest of the single-figure portraits they acquired. The painting is in the realist style; the cultural historian Gillian Whiteley considers the painting resembles the works of the Soviet socialist realists, and provides \\"an authoritative, optimistic, heroic and popular inspirational image\\". The picture shows Loftus, bent over the lathe, which is in the act of cutting the screw of the breech. Her fingers rest on the machinery as she concentrates on the work she is doing. According to the cultural historian Barbara Morden, Ruby Loftus is similar to other works by Knight in showing a female worker focused on her work. The art historian Catherine Speck writes that Loftus's feminine features and clean hands \\"affirm the temporary nature of ... [Loftus's] work 'for the duration' \\" of the war; in this way the painting feels to Speck more like propaganda, rather than an image of Loftus going about her usual work. According to the cultural historian Barbara Morden, Loftus is depicted as \\"a young and attractive woman\\"; with brown curly hair not quite contained under a green headscarf or snood. She wears paint-splattered overalls and make-up, the latter emphasising her femininity. By leaning over the workbench her face is placed in the horizontal centre of the picture, accentuating her importance. Her face is highlighted with the reflection of the light shining on the wet metal. The social historian Elizabeth de Cacqueray observes that Loftus's head and the highlighted metal disk face each other along the diagonal of the picture, with Loftus's head scarf and face repeated ovals that reflect each other. The painting shows Loftus drilling screw threads of the barrel as sparks and water droplets come off the lathe. According to Foss her workspace is \\"clean and efficient-looking\\", while the natural approach to the work‚Äîand the level of technical details captured in the picture‚Äî\\"had the desired effect of testifying to Loftus's exploit [of being expert at her work] being an indisputable fact\\". Detail of the background, showing one man among the working women; the patriotic colours of red, white and blue are repeated throughout The background of the painting shows the rest of factory floor, populated with women working at their benches; there is one man present, probably the foreman, given that he wears a tie. The clothing worn by the women carries a patriotic tone, according to the art historian Mike McKiernan, as reds, whites and blues dominate. According to the cultural historian Lindsey Robb, the painting‚Äîalong with Frank Dobson's 1944 work An Escalator in an Underground Factory‚Äî\\"reinforce the representation of industrial work as female\\" during wartime. According to the art historians Teresa Grimes, Judith Collins and Oriana Baddeley, Knight adopts what they call a \\"documentary approach\\" to the machinery that \\"has the verisimilitude of a photograph but makes a far more powerful impact\\". In this manner, the painting is similar to many examples of British wartime cinema that depicted the working class in an unsentimental manner. Reception Loftus meets Ernest Bevin, the Ministry of Labour, at ROF Newport, c. 1943 Ruby Loftus was exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition on 30 April 1943. Loftus was present that day to see the picture, and was interviewed by the press about her involvement. The following day the painting was reproduced in several national newspapers. The critic for The Times thought the picture had \\"a certain brutal vigour\\", that made it \\"hard to take in all the detail without strain\\"; W. T. Oliver, writing in The Yorkshire Post found \\"little pleasure in Dame Laura's brand of realism\\", but admired \\"her energy, her disciplined thoroughness and conviction\\". A \\"Warwork News\\" newsreel featuring the painting, Knight and Loftus, was released into Britain's cinemas on 10 May 1943; Loftus found herself in the public eye and quickly famous from the coverage, although shop stewards from Woolwich Arsenal, disbelieving the stories of Loftus's prowess in the task, travelled to Newport to check on her skills. They returned satisfied. Ruby Loftus was shown at the 1947 Engineering and Marine Exhibition at the Olympia Exhibition Centre. The picture was also reproduced in a large-scale poster version by the WAAC; it was displayed in factories across the country. It became one of the most well-known and popular works commissioned by the WAAC. The picture shows a woman doing what was traditionally a man's job, and, according to Grimes, Collins and Baddeley, helped to popularise a \\"new, active image of femininity\\". In this respect it has been likened to the American figure of \\"Rosie the Riveter\\"; Norman Rockwell's picture of Rosie appeared on 29 May 1943‚Äîa month after Ruby Loftus was first exhibited. According to Foss, \\"despite the similarity in their two names ... these two wartime icons could hardly be more different. Legacy Knight circa 1910 Loftus married Lance Corporal John Green in September 1943, and took her husband's surname. After the war, she was offered an opportunity to take an engineering course, but decided against it and emigrated to Canada with her husband, eventually settling in Winfield, British Columbia, Canada. In British Columbia, she worked as an apple packer, in a post office and as a correspondent for a local newspaper. She travelled to London to see her portrait in the Imperial War Museum in May 1962, where she was accompanied by Knight. She was later diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Loftus's husband died in 2003, and she died in June 2004 at the age of 83. In 2015 Loftus Garden Village, a housing development named after her, was built on the site of ROF Newport. Looking back at the works Knight painted for the WAAC, Clark wrote to her \\"The pictures you have done for us have been an immense success from every point of view\\". The success of the painting led to further industrial commissions for Knight throughout the 1940s. In 1945 she painted Switch Works at Ellison Switchgear in Birmingham. This was followed by paintings of operations at the Dow Mac concrete railway-sleeper works and at the Skefko ball bearing factory. In 1946 she visited Germany under the auspices of the Nuremberg war crimes trials where she painted The Nuremberg Trial. The painting returned to Newport in 2006 for display as part of a project recording the recollections of women who had worked at the Royal Ordnance Factory. Throughout 2013 and 2014 the painting was lent by the Imperial War Museum for display at the National Portrait Gallery, London, and then at the Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery, as part of the Laura Knight Portraits exhibition. As at , the painting is held in the Imperial War Museums' collection.

The major navies began building torpedo cruisers shortly after the invention of the locomotive Whitehead torpedo in the 1860s. The development of the torpedo gave rise to the Jeune √âcole doctrine, which held that small warships armed with torpedoes could effectively and cheaply defeat much larger battleships. Torpedo cruisers fell out of favor in most of the great power navies in the 1890s, though many other navies continued to acquire them into the early 1900s. The Imperial Japanese Navy rebuilt two light cruisers into torpedo cruisers during World War II. Unlike the earlier vessels, these ships were intended to launch their Long Lance oxygen torpedoes at extreme range at night to surprise enemy warships. They never saw action in their intended role, however, and were quickly converted into troop transports. History Zieten, one of the first torpedo cruisers The torpedo cruiser emerged from the Jeune √âcole, a strategic naval concept that argued that the large ironclad battleships then being built in Europe could be easily --and more importantly, cheaply--defeated by small torpedo-armed warships.Ropp, p. 128 In newly unified Germany, the new torpedo cruiser was embraced as a powerful weapon for a new navy which had no real blue-water traditions of shipbuilding or seafaring. Early German torpedo vessels were classified as avisos, the first being , launched in 1876.Gardiner, pp. 256-257 She was initially armed with just two torpedo tubes, supplemented in 1878 by two guns and six machine guns. The enthusiasm of the German Kaiserliche Admiralit√§t (Imperial Admiralty) was particularly marked during the tenure of General Leo von Caprivi: a total of eight vessels were built, designed to serve with flotillas of smaller torpedo boats, and integrated into a defensive system of minefields and coastal artillery. The typical German torpedokreuzer came to be armed with a salvo of three torpedo tubes, one fixed in the bows and two on rotating mounts on either side of the hull. Their gun armament was relatively modest, with two medium-calibre weapons mounted fore and aft, and a number of smaller broadside guns in sponsons, designed primarily to defend against smaller attackers such as torpedo boats. Concurrently with the German procurement of Zieten, the Italian Regia Marina laid down the small cruiser in 1875, which was armed with a single torpedo tube and two machine guns. The Regia Marina built a further seventeen torpedo cruisers over five classes over the course of the following twenty years.Gardiner, pp. 346-348 Starting in 1879, the French Navy also began experimenting with the type, first with the cruiser , before building a series of smaller torpedo avisos similar to Zieten.Ropp, pp. 129-130 The Austro-Hungarian Navy adopted a similar organization for the confined waters of the Adriatic Sea, with flotillas of torpedo boats grouped with torpedo cruisers, which were intended to defeat enemy battleships attacking the Austro-Hungarian coast.Ropp, pp. 134-136 The plans of the British torpedo cruiser Two of the Austro-Hungarian torpedo cruisers, and , were designed by the English naval architect Sir William White, in the mid-1880s, when there was also a period of intense enthusiasm for the type at the British Admiralty. The one-off and the two ships of the Scout class were promptly followed by numerous torpedo gunboats, two Curlew- class torpedo gunvessels, and the larger ships of the . The torpedo cruiser was seen as a ship which had the potential to become the worldwide mainstay of the fleet, combining the utility of the gunboat, the speed of a dispatch vessel, and an attacking potential comparable to a larger ironclad - \\"valuable during peace, and invaluable during war\\". However, the Archer class were badly over-gunned, which compromised their seaworthiness, and this damaged the type's reputation in Britain: the total order for the class was reduced from twenty ships to eight, and the Royal Navy promptly abandoned the \\"torpedo cruiser\\" designation completely. This may have been an overreaction: sea- officers and ship-designers alike had urged the high command to simply reduce the gun armament, and White continued to produce what were effectively torpedo cruisers under different designations, the \\"third-class cruisers\\" of the Barracouta class and the larger Medea class, designated as \\"second-class protected cruisers\\".Friedman, pp. 147, 151, 174-184. Torpedo cruisers were also procured early by a South American navy. The Chilean Navy ordered at the end of the 1880s, in the shipyard Laird Brothers, the first ships of this type, the that were the torpedo ships and . These two ships would have a notable military success during Chilean Civil War of 1891, when they attacked and sunk the ironclad . Then in 1896 she acquired . The United States Navy was perhaps the only world navy which did not acquire any torpedo cruisers during this period - their procurement process for \\"Torpedo Cruiser No. 1\\" faltered due to unrealistically ambitious demands for high performance at low cost.\\"Torpedo Cruiser No.1\\" on the GlobalSecurity.org website By this point, however, the type was falling into disfavor. The publication of Alfred Thayer Mahan's seminal work, The Influence of Sea Power upon History, in 1890 persuaded many experts to abandon the Jeune √âcole theory in favor of a fleet centered on powerful battleships.Wawro, pp. 160-162 Simultaneously, the first modern light cruisers began to emerge. These ships, such as the German , had the speed and torpedo armament of the earlier torpedo cruiser, but had a bigger hull which also allowed them to carry the gun armament and armor of a larger protected cruisers.Gardiner, pp. 249, 258 Reflecting the change in thinking, was designed as an enlarged torpedokreuzer, combining the standard salvo of three torpedo tubes with a stronger gun armament, but the later ships of the same class were completed with just one fixed tube on either broadside, designed for line of battle tactics. Another new type which threatened to usurp the torpedo cruiser's role was the \\"torpedo-boat destroyer\\", soon simply known as the destroyer. The concept was influenced by the Spanish torpedo cruiser launched in 1886, but the subsequent British type pioneered in 1892 was smaller and faster, and was quickly adopted by all the great power navies of the 1890s. One of the two Peyk-i ≈ûevket-class cruisers However, ships of the German torpedokreuzer type continued to be built for a number of navies outside the great powers. The five vessels of the Swedish , which were built in the late 1890s, continued in service for many decades.Gardiner & Gray, p. 357 German shipyards also produced a number of torpedo cruisers for export to various foreign clients, with Krupp building three for the Brazilian Navy, one for the National Navy of Uruguay, and two for the Ottoman Navy , which were completed in 1907.Fleets of the World, p. 140 One great power battlefleet which continued to utilize the torpedo cruiser was the Imperial Russian Navy. They had employed torpedo-armed warships since the 1870s, using \\"torpedo cutters\\" successfully against the Ottomans in the 1870s, and launched the large \\"torpedo vessel\\" Vzryv in 1877, but their first ship specifically designated as a torpedo cruiser was Leytenant Ilyin of 1886, followed by one sister ship in 1889, and in the 1890s by the six ships of the Kazarskiy class and the more heavily-armed Abrek. These coexisted with conventional destroyers of the British type, and the onset of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 prompted the construction of another twenty-four ships of the type - they were distinguished from contemporary destroyers by being slightly slower, but larger, more heavily-armed and more seaworthy. In order to accelerate production, most of them were built in collaboration with German shipyards, although the Leytenant Shestakov class were an entirely domestic design. All were similar in size and capabilities, typically with a speed of around , three torpedo tubes, two guns, and four guns, and in a departure from the high-freeboard hullform of earlier torpedo cruisers, they were low-freeboard ships with a high forecastle: this style of hull had originated with late- nineteenth century cruisers, but was coming to be associated with destroyers (such as the British ), and in 1907, as part of the review of naval thinking after the Battle of Tsushima, the Russians opted to reclassify all their torpedo cruisers as part of the destroyer fleet. World War II The Imperial Japanese Navy faced a numerical disadvantage against the United States Navy, and prior to the Pacific War, they formulated a strategy of attacking the American fleets through ambush tactics, with heavy reliance on torpedoes. This plan principally emphasized submarines, but with the development of the type 93 torpedo, there was a need for surface vessels that could accommodate such weapons. Three vessels of the of light cruisers were appointed for renovation, namely , and . Renovation of ≈åi and Kitakami began in 1941, with large-scale expansion of the hull, enlargement of the bridge, and removal of main and secondary artillery armaments. quadruple torpedo tubes were mounted on the vessel, with 5 mounts and 20 bays on each side, adding to a total of 10 mounts and 40 bays. Kiso was planned for modification, however the renovations never took place. Kitakami and ≈åi served only briefly in this new role, but were not used operationally before being converted into high speed troop transports in 1942.Stille, pp. 14-18 See also *Torpedo gunboat *List of torpedo cruisers of Italy FootnotesReferences   * Category:Ship types Category:Cruisers ","title":"Torpedo cruiser"},{"id":"41826966","text":"Philip Moon (born November 5, 1961) is an American actor of Asian descent who has appeared primarily in television.

The original rules of the game require the participants to film themselves drinking a pint of an alcoholic beverage, usually beer, in one gulp and upload the footage to the web. A participant then nominates another person to do the same within 24 hours. The game became popular in early 2014, and as it spread it escalated, with nominees performing the challenge in more extreme circumstances, drinking more potent beverages or engaging in dangerous activities either during or immediately after drinking. The British tabloid newspaper Metro reported that at least five deaths in the United Kingdom and Ireland are believed to have been directly linked to the drinking game. One of these was Jonathan Byrne from County Carlow, whose father later appeared on The Late Late Show. History Neknominate originated in New Zealand before spreading to the UK and Ireland. The game's popularity has been linked to a video posted to Facebook by Ross Samson, a London Irish rugby player, on 25 December 2013, in which he drinks a bottle of beer and says \\"I nominate all of you whose birthday it‚Äôs not. Merry Christmas.\\" After deaths were linked to the game, Samson distanced himself from it. An early mention was made of the game on Twitter in 2011, when a British man mentioned playing it with a friend via Skype. In 2013, up until Samson's video, the game was only mentioned 198 times on Twitter; in the two weeks after his video, it was mentioned 1,048 times. Criticism The game has been criticised for the danger it poses to participants. Five people are believed to have died as a result of playing the game, including a Cardiff man thought to have downed a pint of vodka, and a London hostel worker who reportedly mixed an entire bottle of white wine with a quarter bottle of whisky, a small bottle of vodka and a can of lager. In the latter case, the victim's nominator was interviewed by police, but it was ruled an accidental death without coercion. In Ireland, the group Mature Enjoyment of Alcohol in Society expressed concern that posting the videos could \\"appeal to and be taken up by vulnerable younger drinkers\\". Alcohol Action Ireland also shared concerns about the game. Variants Neknomination in a water slide In February 2014, a group of South Africans adapted the Neknominate game into a challenge to perform random acts of kindness for others. Similar kindness challenges include Feed the Deed in Canada and SmartNominate in France, which encourages participants to donate food to homeless people or give blood. The Ice Bucket Challenge, an activity involving dumping a bucket of ice water on someone's head to promote awareness of the disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease) and encourage donations to research went viral on social media during July‚ÄìAugust 2014.

Foodomics requires the combination of food chemistry, biological sciences, and data analysis. The study of foodomics became under the spotlight after it was introduced in the first international conference in 2009 at Cesena, Italy. Many experts in the field of omics and nutrition were invited to this event in order to find the new approach and possibility in the area of food science and technology. However, research and development of foodomics today are still limited due to high throughput analysis required. The American Chemical Society journal called Analytical Chemistry dedicated its cover to foodomics in December 2012.About the Cover (7 December 2012), Vol. 84, Iss. 23 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ac301680q Foodomics involves four main areas of omics: * Genomics, which involves investigation of genome and its pattern. * Transcriptomics, which explores a set of gene and identifies the difference among various conditions, organisms, and circumstance, by using several techniques including microarray analysis; * Proteomics, studies every kind of proteins that is a product of the genes. It covers how protein functions in a particular place, structures, interactions with other proteins, etc; * Metabolomics, includes chemical diversity in the cells and how it affects cell behavior;  Advantages of foodomics  Foodomics greatly helps the scientists in an area of food science and nutrition to gain a better access to data, which is used to analyze the effects of food on human health, etc. It is believed to be another step towards better understanding of development and application of technology and food. Moreover, the study of foodomics leads to other omics sub-disciplines, including nutrigenomics which is the integration of the study of nutrition, gene and omics. Rosemary  Colon cancer Foodomics approach is used to analyze and establish the links between several substances presented in rosemary and the ability to cure colon cancer cells. There are thousands of chemical compounds in rosemary, but the ones that are able to help cure such disease are Carnosic acid (CA) and Carnosol (CS), which can be obtained by extracting rosemary via SFE. They have the potential to fight against and reduce the proliferation of human HT-29 colon cancer cells. The experiment done by inserting rosemary extracts to the mice and collecting RNA and metabolites from each controlled and treated individual indicated that there is a correlation between the compounds used and the percentage of recovery from the cancer. This information is however never achievable without the help of foodomics knowledge as it was used to process data, analyze statistic, and identify biomakers. Foodomics, coupled with transcriptomic data, shows that Carnosic acid leads to the accumulation of an antioxidant, glutothione (GSH). The chemical can be broken down to Cysteinylglycine, a naturally occurring dipeptide and an intermediate in the gamma glutamyl cycle. Moreover, the result from an integration of foodomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics reveals that provoking colon cancer cell compounds, such as N‚Äêacetylputrescine, N‚Äêacetylcadaverine, 5‚ÄôMTA and Œ≥‚Äêaminobutyric acid, can also be lowered by CA treatment. Thus, foodomics plays an important role in explaining the relationship between deadly disease, like colon cancer, and natural compounds existing in rosemary. Data obtained is useful in reaching another approach for tackling proliferation against cancer cells.  Processed meat  Aside from measuring the concentration of protein in meat, calculating bioavailability is another way in determining the total amount of component and quality. The calculation is done when food molecules are digested in various steps. Since human digestion is very complicated, a wide range of analytical techniques are used to obtain the data, including foodomics protocol and an in vitro static simulation of digestion. Bresaola or the air-dried and salted beef. It is made from a single muscle of beef. The procedure is divided into 3 stages as the samples are collected from oral, gastric and duodenal digestion in order to study protein digestibility closely and thoroughly. A meat based food, Bresaola, is evaluated because beef muscles are still intact, which can be used to indicate nutritional value. The consequences of oral step can be observed at the beginning of the gastric digestion, the first stage. As there is no enzymatic proteolytic activity at this stage, the level of H-NMR, a spectrum used to determine the structure, is still constant because there is no change going on. However, when pepsin takes action, TD-NMR, a special technique used for measuring mobile water population with macromolecular solutes, reveals that progressive unbundling of meat fibers helps pepsin activity to digest. TD-NMR data proves that bolus structure changes considerably during the first part of digestion and water molecules, consequently, leave the spaces inside the myofibrils and fiber bundles. This results in a low level of water that can be detected in duodenal stage. Since digestion is in progress, protein molecules become smaller and molecular weight gets lower, in other words, there is an increase in the spectra total area.

The Seville Shipyards () is a medieval shipyard in the city of Seville (Andalusia, Spain). They were operative between the 13th and 15th centuries, and are built in Gothic style. They were specialized in the construction of galleys, which played an important role in the struggles for the control of the Strait of Gibraltar, as well as in the Castilian participation in the Hundred Years' War.P√©rez- Mallaina, op. cit., pp. 349-367 The complex consisted of a building with seventeen naves next to a large sandy area that reached to the edge of the Guadalquivir River. On March 13, 1969, the State declares Monumento Hist√≥rico Art√≠stico to the Shipyards, and on June 18, 1985 the degree of protection of the property declaring the Maestranza de Artiller√≠a de Sevilla (which occupies the seven naves that are conserved and other structures, such as a front pavilion) Bien de Inter√©s Cultural in the Monument category.  Background  The first news about shipyards in the city dates back to the 1st century BC, when the civil war between Pompey and Julius Caesar took place: Fern√°ndez Rojas, op. cit. p. 20 In the 9th century a series of Norman attacks (Vikings) occurred on the peninsular coasts, one of them in Seville. This motivated Caliph Abd ar-Rahman II to reinforce the wall of Isbylia (Seville) (of Roman origin) and to create a permanent war fleet. To this end, he ordered the construction of some shipyards in Seville: Fern√°ndez Rojas, op. cit., p. 28 Some 200 years later, in 1184, the caliph Abu Yusuf Yaqub al-Mansur ordered the then governor of the city, Abu Dawud Yalul ben Yildasan the manufacture of some shipyards where, in a short space of time, build a large fleet to deal with the Christian kingdoms.Fern√°ndez Rojas, op. cit., p. 32 t is not known with certainty where the former shipyards were located. According to the archaeological work carried out, it is known that the Castilian shipyards that are still in use today were not built on any previous ones. Fern√°ndez Rojas, op. cit., p. 35  Original design  Ferdinand III of Castile, conquered Seville from the Muslims in 1248. After making conquests for a large part of the peninsula, he decided to undertake military campaigns to also take the north of Africa and thus prevent possible threats that could come from that area. He decided to build several ships and galleys in Seville.Fern√°ndez Rojas, op. cit., p. 40 However, Fernando dies in 1252 and his son, Alfonso X of Castile \\"the Wise\\", agrees with the usefulness of creating a fleet and orders the construction of the shipyards.Fern√°ndez Rojas, op. cit., p. 41 The site chosen was a site outside the walled enclosure and very close to the Guadalquivir River, in the area between Torre del Oro, Torre de la Plata, the Postigo del Carb√≥n gate and the Postigo del Aceite gate. For this reason, in the neighborhood of El Arenal 17 naves from brick factory were erected perpendicular to the Guadalquivir and in front of the Almohad walls of the city, covering about 15,000 square meters. The Atarazanas also included the so-called Resolana del R√≠o, a large expanse of sand that reached the Guadalquivir. It was one of the largest industrial installations of the Late Middle Ages in Europe, of an extension comparable to that at that time by the Venetian Arsenal. Architecturally it is a Gothic work and Mud√©jar built all of it in a brick factory, which shows the influence of Almohad art in medieval constructions in the city of Seville. Astonish the dimensions of its wide and long naves attached and covered by vaults of edge, appropriate for the construction of the largest ships of the time. These naves communicate laterally through thick arches that are slightly pointed and facing each other, which start directly from the ground, and that together provoke attractive prospects inside.  Operation  Naval combat between galleys and carracks towards 1561. In 1253 there were already ten galleys built and King Alfonso appointed ten captains or commissars, some of them French and Italians who had come to collaborate in the Reconquista.Fern√°ndez Rojas, op. cit., p. 42 The commissars and their heirs had to take care of and repair the galley that was delivered to them and always use it in the name of the king and under the dependence of the Major Admiral of Castile (a position created by Alfonso in 1254). In 1407, reigning John II of Castile, in Seville there were already 70 commissars.Fern√°ndez Rojas, op. cit., p. 43 The Major Admiral of Castile also had voice and vote in the municipal council. Besides as a shipyard, the Crown used the Shipyards for other functions since its first centuries of operation. Because of their large size, they served to host assemblies and public celebrations. They were also a natural place to store the booty and the prisoners captured by the fleets of the Castilian kings. Sometimes they served as jails for the social elite, for example for the nobles related to the king Peter of Castile after the victory of his rival Henry II of Castile. The Shipyards were able to build frequently fleets of twenty galleys and, on special occasions, of up to thirty. The Castilian kings used them in the struggles for control of the Strait of Gibraltar against the Muslims and also in raids against England during the Hundred Years' War. For its construction and armament, a labor force of between 400 and 500 artisans was temporarily mobilized, who, in exchange for working for the Crown for half the usual salary, enjoyed great fiscal privileges throughout the year. For this reason they were called \\"francs\\". In addition, the Crown possessed in the Shipyards an indeterminate number of slaves, mainly Muslim prisoners, who were in charge of the most painful tasks. The wood for the construction of the ships was brought from forests owned by the Crown located in the Sierra Norte de Sevilla. Model of the Seville Shipyard The naves could hold a large number of galleys and vessels, as well as all the equipment for assembly, repair and maintenance. The spoils of war were also kept there. Caulkers, carpenters, blacksmiths and other artisans worked inside it. Those who work there were under the authority of the alcaide of the Alc√°zar of Seville (the palace- fortress nearby) and the Shipyards. This warden was appointed by the king. The position of warden used to fall to a nobleman who, at times, delegated the exercise of his work to a man of trust.Fern√°ndez Rojas, op. cit., pp. 44-46 In the first third of the 15th century the Shipyards set up its last large fleets of galleys. Fifteen ships were destined to an incursion against England in 1420 and an indeterminate number to the war against Aragon in 1430. After these contests, the orders of the Castilian kings became increasingly scarce. In the middle of the century the hulls of some twenty galleys, built but not armed, were rotting in their facilities. During the last stages of the Reconquista the Catholic Monarchs installed the seat of their court in Seville. At the end of the 15th century, some of the repair works of the shipyards were carried out by order of the latter. Later, in 1493, the Catholic Monarchs approved that the fish market move from the Plaza de San Francisco square to the first nave (the one closest to the Postigo del Aceite gate) of the Shipyards. In that nave several fish markets and some houses were placed. Fern√°ndez Rojas, op. cit., pp. 52-53 On February 14, 1503, on the occasion of the constitution of the Casa de Contrataci√≥n de Indias, the nave was destined to the south as the headquarters of the Casa. However, on June 5, the headquarters of the Casa to the Alc√°zar would be moved.Fern√°ndez Rojas, op. cit., p. 55 In 1587 the customs of the city was located on naves 13, 14 and 15, south of the building.Fern√°ndez Rojas, op. cit., p. 64 Throughout the 16th century one nave was rented as an oil warehouse and another as a wool warehouse. The warden would be in charge of the surveillance of the site and the collection of all rentals . Another nave was destined for a mercury store, which was brought in bags of lamb skins from Almad√©n mines and then used to help extract silver in the American mines.Fern√°ndez Rojas, op. cit., p. 55 In this view of Seville at the end of the 16th century, \\"The Shipyards\\" is indicated with n¬∫ 23, next to \\"Postigo del Carb√≥n\\" gate (n¬∫ 43). In addition to the need for warehouses, there were other reasons for the cessation of its use as shipyards. In the first place, after the end of the wars with England and the battles for the Strait of Gibraltar, the kingdom of Castile stopped needing fleets of war so frequently. Second, the architectural design of the Shipyards made them capable of building only galleys, and this type of vessel was losing combat capacity against novel designs of sailing ships such as the carrack and the nao, which were faster and stronger and had much greater range thanks to its less numerous crews. For the Crown it was also more economically advantageous to rent private sailships to its owners than to build and maintain permanent fleets of galleys. Finally, the ascent to the throne in 1475 of Isabella I and her husband Ferdinand II of Aragon (called the Catholic Monarchs years later) supposed that the sovereigns of Castile became available to the shipyards of galleys of the Crown of Aragon, which possibly were cheaper than the one in Seville. Although the workload of the Shipyards was decreasing, the number of artisans officially linked to them was scarcely reduced. This provoked frequent protests by the Council of Seville about the injustice represented by the tax exemptions of these \\"francs\\" as well as other protected occupations. Among other tasks, until 1549 the fourth nave of the Shipyards was destined to the manufacture of pumps to reduce water in the boats, for what was known as \\"the fireman's nave\\".Fern√°ndez Rojas, op. cit., p. 58 In 1570 a large galley would be built in Barcelona that would be taken to Seville to be decorated with Renaissance allegorical motifs. This was the Capitana galley that was commanded by John of Austria during the Battle of Lepanto. On June 5, 1593 King Philip II of Spain would prohibit by Royal Decree that the ships built in the Sevillian Shipyards be used for trips to the Indies, citing the worst quality of the wood used in them compared to the best quality of the shipyards from the north of Spain. Fern√°ndez Rojas, op. cit., p. 57 Little by little, the Shipyards abandoned its role as shipyards to be commercial warehouses. In addition to the aforementioned elements, sugar, ginger, cinnamon, medicinal plants and noble woods from the Indies were also stored. In the 18th century they were labeled with a sign that read: \\"La Real Casa de Atarazanas de Azogues de Indias\\" (The Royal House of Shipyards of Markets of Indies).  Transformations and destruction  Plan of Olavide of 1771. They indicate, from left to right, the Real Maestranza de Artiller√≠a de Sevilla (156), the Hospital de la Caridad (139), the Customs (154) and a wool warehouse (155). Throughout its history, the building of the Royal Shipyards has undergone important transformations. At present, only seven of the seventeen original naves remain standing. The first major architectural intervention on the building of the Shipyards took place in the year 1641 with the construction of Hospital de la Caridad and its church, which occupied five of the naves, whose arches can still be glimpsed today. In 1719 the Government ordered that five naves pass to store artillery material, a function that had already been carried out by the Shipyards since 1587. In 1762 began a major reform of the Artillery Corps that would take over the years to the Real Maestranza de Artiller√≠a de Sevilla located in the Shipyards had a large warehouse of carriages and accoutrements to supply the troops, which resulted in an expansion in the capacity of workshops and warehouses with the annexation of two more naves to complete the seven that would occupy the Army until the 20th century. In 1782, the Maestranzas of C√°diz and M√°laga merged into that of Seville, leaving it as the sole supplier for all Andalusia and Extremadura and, one year later, also for the Indias, which led to a new architectural operation that transformed part of the building and raised the current fa√ßade. Apart from the construction of Hospital de la Caridad in the 17th century, the rest of the structure of the original building survived completely until 1945, when five of the buildings were demolished to make room for the construction of the current building of the Treasury Delegation. The Shipyards of Seville have been declared Bien de Inter√©s Cultural and cataloged as Monumento Nacional since 1969. In 1993 they became property of the Junta de Andaluc√≠a. In 2009, the Board assigned the building to the La Caixa financial entity for a period of 75 years in order to build a cultural dissemination center called CaixaForum Sevilla. At the end of 2012 La Caixa announced that it would build the Caixaforum in another part of the city, which sparked a conflict with the Junta de Andaluc√≠a that concluded with an agreement whereby the financial institution would invest 10 million euros in another cultural project different in the Shipyards.

She performed at Z√©nith in 1919. In 1920 she toured North Africa. During the 1920‚Äì26 period she was at the height of her career. She sang at l'Europ√©en in 1922, at l'Eldorado in 1923, and again at l'Europ√©en in 1925, where she was featured for three months. Emma Li√©bel was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1926. She retired that year to Boeil Bezing near Nay, Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques, where she opened a caf√© cabaret. She died in January 1928. Different sources give the cause of death as sepsis from a bad scissor cut by her hairdresser or as pleurisy. She was soon forgotten, perhaps due to the rapid deterioration of her recordings. Although she had recorded over 33 two-sided discs for Path√©-Fr√®res by 1926, the company's 1931 catalog listed just 11 of them. Work Emma Li√©bel was a highly original artist, celebrated for her work in the chanson r√©aliste genre, but her range extended from light popular songs to melodramatic works. She influenced later artists such as Fr√©hel, Damia and even √âdith Piaf. Her 1911 song Bonsoir m'amour (Good evening, my love) was adapted into the anti-war La Chanson de Craonne by troops during World War I, and was banned by the General Staff. Emma Li√©bel made about 200 recordings, including: *Bonsoir m'amour (1911) by Raoul Le Peltier and Adelmar Sablon *Les go√©lands (1913) by Lucien Boyer *La coco (1916) by Edmond Bouchaud and Gaston Ouvrard *Du gris (1920) by Ernest Dumont and Ferdinand-Louis B√©nech *La Violetera (1920) by Eduardo Montesinos and Jos√© Padilla *Autour des usines (1922), words by Ernest Dumont, music by Ferdinand-Louis B√©nech, *Ma chanson (1923) by Roland Ga√´l, music by Ren√© de Buxeuil *Pars (1924) by Jean Lenoir *Valencia (1926) by J.A. de la Prada (adapted by Lucien Boyer and Jacques-Charles), music by Jos√© Padilla *Il m'a vue nue (1926) words by Rip, music by Fred Pearly and Pierre Chagnon *Mon Paris (1925) by Lucien Boyer, Jean Boyer and Vincent Scotto References Citations Sources  Category:1873 births Category:1928 deaths Category:People from Pau, Pyr√©n√©es-Atlantiques Category:French female singers Category:19th-century French singers Category:19th-century women singers ","title":"Emma Li√©bel"},{"id":"41827625","text":"Seriously Funny Kids is an American comedy series hosted by Heidi Klum that aired from February 1 until April 11, 2011.

ACGE focus is to blend the current K-pop image with international trends that are beyond the Korean social and creative boundaries in order to appeal better to the emerging global K-pop market mainly by promoting artists for their personality. In order to better describe their vision, they have declared a subgenre of K-pop called \\"Global K-pop\\", attempting to create products specifically tailored for the peculiar taste of international K-pop fans. In the process of doing so they will attempt to create groups that include non-Asian members. All their releases will be bilingual (English and Korean) and distributed both internationally and to the Korean market.  History  ACGE started in 2009 as a non-commercial Korean pop content creator and it soon built a significant subscription base on YouTube and other platforms mainly thanks to their Areia Remix brand which features remixed versions of popular Korean songs. As soon as 2011 ACGE was involved with the production of original music for various international artists. In 2012 they will co-operate with K-pop company Trophy Entertainment and will assist in the production of two singles for their artist Andamiro: Hypnotize and Waiting. The same co-operation will result in the first official Areia Remix, Chi-Chi's Love Is Energy. In December 2012, a crowdfunding campaign that raised about $15,000 helped in the upgrade of Areia Creation's Seoul based recording studio and led to the registration of the company.  Artists  In September 2013 ACGE has announced Rydia, the first female solo artist to debut under the company in mid 2015. In March 2014 a Korean Australian solo artist, Hany Lee was announced also set for a debut in early Summer 2015. In January 2015 the artist \\"Roh Siena\\" was signed and a Music Video release of her followed later that year. As of July 13, the contract has been terminated for Hany Lee.

He often wrote under the pseudonym of Captain Thomas Newte and this fictitious character had his own history and received independent recognition. Life Born in the parish of Forteviot, Perthshire, he was son of Matthew Thomson, builder, carpenter, and farmer, by his wife, who was the daughter of the schoolmaster of Avintully, near Dunkeld, with surname Miller. Educated at the parish school, Perth grammar school, and St. Andrews University, he became librarian at Dupplin Castle, Perthshire, to Thomas Hay, 9th Earl of Kinnoull. The Earl encouraged him to study for the Church of Scotland, and promised him a parish in his patronage. Completing his theological studies at St. Andrews and Edinburgh, Thomson was ordained on 20 March 1776 assistant to James Porteous, the minister of Monivaird, Perthshire; but his habits and tastes clashed with the post. After complaints by parishioners, he resigned on 1 October 1778, and went to London as a man of letters. At first unsuccessful, Thomson depended on an income from the Earl of Kinnoull. On 31 October 1783 he received an honorary degree of LL.D. from Glasgow University, and shortly found plenty of work. In 1790 he supported John Leslie by giving him work. Shortly afterwards he joined the circle of Joseph Johnson. Thomson died at his house at Kensington Gravel Pits, on 16 February 1817. Captain Thomas Newte Newte was fictionally born in Devonshire in 1752, therefore being slightly younger than the true Thomson. He claimed to be a landowner in Devonshire and to own several ships run by the East India Company. In 1793 \\"Newte\\" was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh during a visit to that city. His proposers were Dugald Stewart, Sir James Hall, and John Playfair. The notable book published (to much acclaim) by Newte was Prospects and Observations on a Tour of England and Scotland published in 1791.https://www.amazon.co.uk/Books-Thomas- Newte/s?ie=UTF8&page;=1&rh;=n%3A266239%2Cp_27%3AThomas%20Newte Works Thomson made a reputation with his continuation of Robert Watson's History of Philip III of Spain, 1783, for which he wrote the fifth and sixth books. During the rest of his life, he wrote pamphlets, memoirs, biographies, voyages, travels, and treatises. He tried novels and dramas, collaborated with others, and used pseudonyms. Thomson's main works include: * Travels in Europe, Asia, and Africa, 1782. * The Man in the Moon, a satirical novel in the style of Jonathan Swift, 1783. * History of Great Britain from the Revolution of 1688 to the Accession of George I, 2 vols. 1787, from the Latin manuscript of Alexander Cunningham. This translation was carried out for Thomas Hollingbery. Thomson confused the issue of the authorship in his introduction: he argued, wrongly and in a way that could be refuted from the extant wills, that the author was the same person as Alexander Cunningham of Block the critic (1655?‚Äì1730). He had supporters including Samuel Parr for his theory, which did not last into the 19th century. * Memoirs of the War in Asia from 1780 to 1784, 2 vols. 1788. * Appeal to the People on behalf of Warren Hastings, 1788. * Mammuth, or Human Nature displayed on a grand scale, in a Tour with the Tinkers into the Central Parts of Africa, 1789. * A Tour in England and Scotland by an English Gentleman, 1789, enlarged into Prospects and Observations on a Tour in England and Scotland, by Thomas Newte, Esq., 1791. Newte's family owned the estate of DuvaleGray, Todd & Rowe, Margery (Eds.), Travels in Georgian Devon: The Illustrated Journals of The Reverend John Swete, 1789‚Äì1800, 4 vols., Tiverton, 1999, p.54 in the parish of Bampton, Devon and resided there or at nearby TivertonLysons, Samuel & Daniel Lysons Daniel , Magna Britannia, Vol.6: Devon, London, 1822 * Memoirs of Sergeant Donald Macleod, 1791. * Travels into Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, by Andrew Swinton, 1792. * Introduction to the Trial of Mr. Hastings, 1796. * Memoirs relative to Military Tactics, 1805. * Travels in Scotland by James Hall, illustrated, 1807. Thomson also: * continued Oliver Goldsmith's History of Greece; * expanded in 1793 John Lanne Buchanan's Travels in the Hebrides; * translated Travels to the North Cape, from the Italian of Giuseppe Acerbi; * compiled under the name of Harrison a commentary on the Bible; and * edited Narrative of an Expedition against the revolted Negroes of Surinam, by John Gabriel Stedman. It is now known that Thomson made significant changes to the manuscript, in producing the first edition. Stedman rejected that first edition of 1795, requiring it to be destroyed, and the 1796 edition was based on both Thomson's work and the original. A five-act tragedy, Caledonia, or the Clans of Yore, appeared posthumously in 1818. Thomson prepared from 1790 to 1800 the historical part of Dodsley's Annual Register. From 1794 to December 1796 Thomson owned The English Review, and largely wrote its content. When he gave up the ownership it was incorporated into the Analytical Review. He also wrote for the European Magazine, the Political Herald, The Oracle, and the Whitehall Evening Post. In politics, he defended the French Revolution in 1792 in an open letter to Samuel Parr; and as the columnist \\"Ignotus\\" in The Oracle he supported Charles James Fox. Family Thomson was twice married, firstly to Diana Miltone, who was Scottish. His second wife was a novelist, who wrote The Labyrinth of Life and other works. There were children by both marriages.

Part of the village lies in Switzerland, and part in France, with the boundary dividing not only the village itself, but at least four structures within it. One of these structures is the Hotel Arbez, in which the dining hall and other rooms are bisected by the border. History Until 1862, La Cure was entirely in France. France and Switzerland had previously disputed possession of the strategically important Vall√©e des Dappes, which was controlled by the latter until in 1862, the Swiss accepted an offer to exchange that territory for another piece just to the north and east; the new boundary was drawn directly through La Cure. According to the Treaty of Dappes, which formalized the swap, any buildings existing at the time that the new line was demarcated were not to be disturbed, even if the boundary bisected them.La Cure Photos and Maps Today, the border passes through the Hotel Arbez (see below); in addition, it bisects at least two residences, and a pub.La Cure Photos and Maps Railway There is a Swiss Railways narrow gauge railway line, the Nyon‚ÄìSt-Cergue‚ÄìMorez Railway, that runs from Nyon to La Cure.

Life Alexander Gribanovsky was born on August 6, 1873, in village Bratki in the Borisoglebsky Uyezd of Russia's Tambov Governorate (now Ternovsky District, Voronezh Oblast) to the Priest Aleksey Gribanovsky and Anna (n√©e Karmazina). After completing the Tambov theological primary school and then the Tambov theological seminary, Alexander enrolled in the Moscow Theological Academy, then under the rectorship of Archimandrite Anthony (Khrapovitsky), the future Metropolitan of Kiev and founding First Hierarch of the ROCOR. After completing the Academy in April 1898, Alexander was tonsured a monk by Bishop Alexander of Tambov with the name Anastasius after St. Anastasius Sinaita. On April 23, 1898, he was ordained a hierodeacon, and shortly thereafter a hieromonk. In 1900, Hieromonk Anastasy was appointed inspector of the Bethany Theological Seminary near Holy Trinity Lavra. In 1901 he became inspector of the Moscow Theological Seminary, with elevation to the rank of archimandrite. On June 29, 1906, he was ordained Bishop of Serpukhov, vicar of the Moscow diocese. At his ordination, he pronounced a remarkable homily \\"The True Way of Christ's Pastoral Work\\", in which he prophesied the upcoming turmoil and persecutions. In the position of vicar of the Moscow diocese, Bishop Anastasy's responsibilities included daily services in the Moscow Kremlin's Dormition Cathedral, the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, and other Muscovite churches and monasteries, as well as visitations to parishes, direction of institutions of theological learning, and direction of a committee to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Borodino and the 300th anniversary of the Romanov dynasty. In May 1914, Bishop Anastasy was appointed to the Kholm and Liublin diocese. A month and a half later, the First World War began, and, in addition to his diocesan duties, Bishop Anastasius served soldiers on the front, for which he was decorated with the Order of St Vladimir, and, later, the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky. In 1915, he was forced to evacuate from the front to the interior, and lived in Moscow at the Chudov Monastery. In the end of 1915, he was appointed to the Eparchy of Chi≈üinƒÉu and Khotin, and in 1916 he was elevated to the rank of archbishop. With the opening of the Romanian front, Archbishop Anastasy once again found himself in an area with military operations. In August 1917 he left Bessarabia for Moscow to participate in the All-Russian Council of 1917-1918. During the election of a new Patriarch of Moscow, his candidacy received 77 votes; he then participated in the preparation for the enthronement of Patriarch St. Tikhon of Moscow, which he described in his article \\"Election and Enthronement of His Holiness Patriarch Tikhon, his personality and work.\\" Archbishop Anastasy was elected a member of the Holy Synod of Bishops. In October 1918, he departed from Moscow headed for Odessa with the hope of being able to return to Chi≈üinƒÉu, which was under Romanian occupation. He was not able, however, to return to Bessarabia because of pressure from Romanian authorities to leave the Russian Church and enter into the jurisdiction of the Romanian Patriarchate. He refused to join the Romanian Orthodox Church, and so remained in Odessa. With the Bolshevik invasion, he was forced to leave for Constantinople in 1919. Briefly returning to Russia, he visited Novorosiisk, Rostov, and Novocherkassk, where he made contacts with the Supreme Church Authority of South-East Russia, under the leadership of Metropolitan Anthony (Khrapovitsky). He then once again left Russia for Constantinople through Odessa. In 1921, by decree of the Temporary Higher Church Administration Abroad, he visited Mount Athos and the Holy Land, in order to be acquainted with the state of Russian monasteries in those locations. He then participated in the first All-Diaspora Council of the ROCOR in Sremski Karlovci, Serbia, as administrator of Russian parishes in the Constantinapolitan district. In 1923, at the invitation of Patriarch Meletius IV of Constantinople, he participated in the so-called \\"Pan Orthodox Congress\\" in Constantinople. The Congress made decisions about adopting the new calendar, allowing remarriage for clergy and married bishops, shortening services, eliminating fasts, and simplifying ecclesiastic robes. Archbishop Anastasius voiced his objections to such decisions, which he deemed uncanonical. Because the Ecumenical Patriarchate had forbidden the commemoration of Patriarch Tikhon at services in the Russian Orthodox parishes in the area and demanded that Archbishop Anastasius sever ties with the Synod Abroad of the ROCOR, he was forced to leave Constantinople for Bulgaria via France. In Bulgaria, he participated in the consecration of St. Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, and then departed for Serbia. In 1924, he was appointed as administrator of the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Jerusalem and departed for the Holy Land, where he spent the next 10 years. In 1935, Archbishop Anastasy participated in a council called by Serbian Patriarch Varnava with the aim of restoring unity in the Russian Orthodox Church abroad. The Council was attended by Metropolitan Eulogius (Georgievsky), who headed the Western European Metropolia (the predecessor to the Patriarchal Exarchate for Orthodox Parishes of Russian Tradition in Western Europe), Metropolitan Theophilus (Pashkovsky) of San Francisco, who headed the North American Metropolia (the predecessor to the Orthodox Church in America), and Bishop Dimitry (Voznesensky), who represented the Far East Metropolia. At this meeting, the unity of the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia was restored, albeit temporarily, and the bishops signed the Temporary Statues of the Russian Orthodox Church Abroad, which became the charter governing the ROCOR. At that time Archbishop Anastasy was elevated to the rank of metropolitan and appointed assistant to Metropolitan Anthony (Khrapovitsky). After the death of Metropolitan Anthony in 1936, Metropolitan Anastasius was unanimously elected as the new First Hierarch of the ROCOR. In 1938, Metropolitan Anastasy presided over the second All-Diaspora Council. With the beginning of World War II, Metropolitan Anastasius found himself once again in the zone of hostilities as German forces bombed and then occupied Belgrade in 1941. The invasion of the Soviet Union in June, 1941, prompted Joseph Stalin to reconsider state policies vis-a-vis the Russian Church. Stalin released bishops from prison and allowed churches to be reopened. With his permission, hierarchs in the Soviet Union elected Metropolitan Sergius (Stragorodsky) as Patriarch of Moscow on September 8, 1943. On October 21, 1943, in Vienna, Metropolitan Anastasius together with eight exile hierarchs denounced the election as uncanonical. With the approach of the Soviet army on Belgrade in September, 1944, the Synod of Bishops relocated to Vienna and then, in the summer of 1945, to Munich, Germany. Starting in 1948, many Russian displaced persons began to relocate to the United States. This prompted many to call for the Synod to relocate across the Atlantic, especially given the events of the 1946 at the All-American Council of Cleveland, where the North American Metropolia voted to break ties with the ROCOR. Given these circumstances, on November 23, 1950, Metropolitan Anastasy left Munich for New York. Immediately after his arrival in the United States, on November 25, 1950, he traveled to Jordanville, New York, where he consecrated Holy Trinity Cathedral, the main church of the hamlet's Holy Trinity Monastery. The consecration was followed by the first meeting of the ROCOR Council of Bishops on US soil with the participation of 11 hierarchs. There also, and for the first (and only) time in the history of the ROCOR, Metropolitan Anastasy officiated at the consecration of the holy chrism. Prior to this, the ROCOR had received chrism from the Serbian Orthodox Church. Once in the United States, Metropolitan Anastasius took up residence at the New Kursk-Root Hermitage in Mahopac, New York. Metropolitan Anastasius' tenure saw the blossoming of ROCOR in North America with the opening of about 100 new parishes and the consecration six new bishops: Anthony (Sinkevich) of Los Angeles, Averky (Taushev) of Syracuse and Holy Trinity, Sava (Rayevsky) of Sydney, Anthony (Medvedev) of San Francisco, Sava (Sarachevich) of Edmonton, and Nectarius (Kontzevich) of Seattle. Every summer, starting in 1951, Metropolitan Anastasy would undertake a trip across the United States to California, where he would spend a significant part of the summer in San Francisco. There, at his initiative, the Synod established the parish of All Saints of Russia in Burlingame, California. Because of his ill health, Metropolitan Anastasius petitioned for the election of a successor in 1964. To this purpose, the Council of Bishops met on May 27, 1964, and elected Bishop Philaret (Voznesensky) of Brisbane as the new First Hierarch of the ROCOR. After Metropolitan Anastasy retired the Synod awarded him the title of \\"beatitude\\" with the right of wearing two panagias. The final act of his episcopal services saw the glorification of St. John of Kronstadt by the same Council of Bishops. Soon afterward, Metropolitan Anastasy died on May 22, 1965. He was buried at Holy Trinity Monastery in Jordanville, New York.

He was a prominent follower of the Illyrian movement, supporting the programme of cultural unification of South Slavs under Illyrian name. As secretary of the Reading Room (ƒåitaonica) and Matica ilirska he was connected with prominent individuals in Croatia and other Slavic countries, distributed books and magazines, edited printed editions of older writers (Ivan Gunduliƒá, Andrija Kaƒçiƒá Mio≈°iƒá, Pavao Ritter Vitezoviƒá, Junije Palmotiƒá, Ignjat ƒêurƒëeviƒá, Jerolim Kavanjin) and worked on the establishment of many cultural and scientific institutions. In 1846 he was appointed as the first professor of Croatian language at the Zagreb Royal Academy. Following a reorganization of the educational system he taught in a gymnasium since 1850 until his death. He published several treatises on the Illyrian alphabet and orthography, one poem, and minor contributions and translations in Danica ilirska which he also edited and redacted. In 1836 he published in Danica ilirska his Osnova slovnice slavjanske narƒõƒçja ilirskoga (\\"The basics of the Slavic grammar of the Illyrian dialect\\"), the first Illyrian grammar which served as a linguistic norm for 50 years, and the first Croatian attempt to write a scientific grammar of a language. His second grammar was written in German (Grundz√ºge der illirischen Sprachlehre), was translated to Italian (Fondamenti della grammatica illirica) and published alongside his Ilirsko- nƒõmaƒçko-talianski mali rƒõƒçnik (\\"Illyrian-German-Italian small dictionary\\") written by Josip Drobniƒç.

While the cultural tradition is one of the best examples of a nominally heterosexual community also accepting homosexual and bisexual relationships, author Kanalu G. Terry Young states in his book Rethinking the Native Hawaiian Past that these relationships were not bisexual in a social sense. These were relationships from the  ª≈çiwi wale times that held no stigmatism to the persons  ªano (one's nature or character). To call it a bisexual relationship is liking saying the children of multiple husbands from one Hawaiian mother were out of wedlock. For the time, the comparison is impossible. These relationships are accepted as part of the history of ancient Hawaiian culture. Among men, the sexual relationships usually begin when the partners are teens and continue throughout their lives, even though they also maintain heterosexual partners. The Hawaiian aikane relationship is well known to have been a part of life for Hawaiian nobility, including Kamehameha. While more examples of male relationships exist, some stories refer to women's desires, supporting the theory that some women may have been involved in aikƒÅne relationships as well. In regard to the aikƒÅne relationship, Lieutenant James King stated that \\"all the chiefs had them\\". He recounts a tale that Captain Cook was actually asked by one chief to leave King behind, considering such an offer a great honor. A number of Cook's crew related tales of the tradition with great disdain. American adventurer and sailor, John Ledyard commented in detail about the tradition as he perceived it. The relationships were official and in no way hidden. The sexual relationship was considered natural by the Hawaiians of that time. The word and social category of aikƒÅne refers to: ai or intimate sexual relationship; and kƒÅne or male/husband. In traditional mo'olelo or chants, women and goddesses (as well as ali'i chiefs) referred to their female lovers as aikƒÅne, as when the goddess Hi'iaka refers to her female lover Hopoe as her aikƒÅne. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the word aikƒÅne was \\"purified\\" of its sexual meaning by colonialism, and in print meant simply \\"friend\\", although in Hawaiian language publications its metaphorical meaning could mean either \\"friend\\" or \\"lover\\" without stigmatization. Although their roles are often conflated with aikƒÅne in contemporary LGBT culture, the MƒÅh≈´ are in a social category of liminal gender. MƒÅh≈´ (in the middle) live in a space between the genders, and many live in the opposite gender to their birth.

These cities did not necessarily form around castles after the Edo period; some are known as Jin'yamachi, cities that have evolved around Jin'ya or government offices that are not intended to provide military services. Defined broadly, Jokamachi includes Jin'yamachi. It is also referred to as J≈çka as was common before the early modern period. The city of Tatsuno is a castle town. An old map of the castle town surrounding Himeji Castle A well-preserved castle town district in Hagi, Yamaguchi  History  The advent of J≈çkamachi dates back to the Sengoku period (period of warring states). Jokamachi functions both as a military base represented by the castle and an administrative and commercial city. Oda Nobunaga was the biggest contributor to the development of early-modern J≈çkamachi. He aimed at promoting Heinobunri (distinguishing the samurai class from the rest by giving privileged status to samurai and disarming farmers and the rest) by forcing the samurai class to live in J≈çkamachi, while establishing Rakuichi-rakuza (free markets and open guilds) to stimulate merchandising and trade. J≈çkamachi flourished even more under Toyotomi Hideyoshi's regime whose political and commercial epicenter Osaka-j≈çka became very prosperous as the center of commodities. Osaka continued to be the business center in the Edo period and was called the \\"kitchen of the land\\". Most of the world's walled cities comprise a castle and a city inside the defensive walls. While Japan did have towns and villages surrounded by moats and earth mounds such as Sakai and Jinaicho (temple town), Jokamachi initially had moats and walls only around the feudal lord's castle and did not build walls around the entire city. However, as Jokamachi developed and increased its economic and political value, it demanded protection from wars and turmoil. More and more cities were built with moats and defensive walls, the style of which is known as So-gamae (full defence perimeter), and gradually came to resemble walled cities. In the Edo period, Jokamachi served less as a military base and more as a political and economic capital for the Bakufu (government) and Han (domains). This shift was a result of the lack of warfare throughout the Edo period and the fact that most of the Han lords were occasionally transferred from one domain to another and thus had little attachment to the city per se (although crop yields remained matters of attention). Geographical locations that emphasized the castle's defensive abilities did not necessarily offer good access, and in many cases, as cities increasingly became trade centers, they abandoned their castles and relocated their government base in Jin'ya. The population of a J≈çkamachi, of which nearly 300 existed, is varied. There are large-sized J≈çkamachi such as Kanazawa and Sendai with approximately 120,000 residents, samurai and merchants combined, while there are small-sized J≈çkamachi like Kameda in the Tohoku area with around 4,000 people. In many cases, the population is somewhere around 10,000.  Urban structure  The design of a J≈çkamachi aimed to stimulate commerce by reworking the closest main road to pass through the city so that traffic occurs within the J≈çka. The main road passed through the front of the castle rather than the back to demonstrate power of the authority, regardless of geographical concerns that might exist. J≈çkamachi incorporated various ideas to strengthen the city's defense. To prevent invasions, it cleverly used rivers and other terrains, dug moats, built earth mounds and stone walls, and sometimes constructed heavy gateways like Masugata gates if the city was deemed strategically important. Inside the J≈çka, houses were tightly located on either side of the main street to make it harder to directly view the castle, and roads were cranked or had dead ends to elongate the route to the castle. Smaller sections of the city built fences and wooden gates shutting them at night with guards to ward off intruders. Moats were also used as canals and played a large role in distribution of goods. These cities tended to exist around river terraces in eastern Japan and deltas facing the ocean in western Japan, while cities like Hikone, Zeze, and Suwa are adjacent to a lake as part of the \\"lake type\\" J≈çkamachi. Within a J≈çkamachi, smaller districts like Samurai-machi, Ashigaru-machi, Ch≈çnin, and Tera-machi surrounded the castle. A Samurai-machi is a district for samurai's compounds also known as Samurai-yashiki. In principle, higher-ranked vassals owned a compound closer to the castle. Modern towns with names like Sange, Kamiyashiki-machi, Shitayashiki-machi are descendants of Samurai-machi. People at a lower status like Ashigaru were often forced to live at the outer rim of Ch≈çnin districts. Today, towns with names like Banch≈ç, Yuminoch≈ç, and Teppoch≈ç tend to be what were originally Ashigaru-machi. Ch≈çnin-chi (Chonin district) is a district that lay outside of Samurai-machi for merchants and craftsmen. Villagers who lived near the Jokamachi resided in Chonin-chi when they moved in. Merchants and craftsmen were allocated according to their occupation. Towns today with names like Gofuku-machi (\\"apparel town\\"), Aburaya-cho (\\"oil town\\"), Daiku-machi (\\"carpenter town\\"), Kaji-machi (\\"blacksmith town\\"), and K≈çya-ch≈ç (\\"dye-shop town\\") are remnants of Ch≈çnin-chi. Ch≈çnin-chi was smaller in land size per family compared to Samurai-machi and were tightly aligned along the streets. This is why a Ch≈çnin house had a narrow entrance and great depth and was called an \\"eel's nest\\". It had two floors, but the second floor was used as a storeroom to avoid looking down at the feudal lord. Tera-machi was placed on the outer rim of the Jokamachi and formed an array of large temples. It contributed to reinforcing the city's defense.  Modern presence  In Japan today, more than half of its cities with a population of over 100,000 are former J≈çkamachi. Their appearances have changed through great fires, war damage, and urban development. Cities with any signs of the original J≈çkamachi are decreasing, and those that have preserved the entire area are very few. However, many former J≈çkamachi have preserved remnants of the old city design albeit partly, and cities with streets originally designed to hamper foreign intruders are indeed causing traffic congestion today. Modern cities often have other traces of J≈çkamachi such as former Ch≈çnin-chi districts that still function as the city center as well as festivals and traditions that have continued since the J≈çkamachi era. Cities that have kept its design from before the Edo period are often called Sho-kyoto (\\"small Kyoto\\"). Cities with remnants of the Edo period are sometimes called Ko-edo (\\"small Edo\\").

There were 42 deaths in the accident, which left another 37 injured. The state government appointed a one-man commission under retired justice A. Raman to look into the enquiry. The state government also announced a compensation of one lakh (100,000 Indian Rupees) for all the victims and 15,000 for the injured. During 2005, there were heavy rains in Tamil Nadu and its coastal areas were flooded. Many people were rendered homeless by flooding during November and December. Relief measures were announced by the government that necessitated collecting tokens from authorities in different centres across the city. Background During 2005, there were heavy rains in Chennai and the surrounding areas that resulted in severe flooding. Most coastal areas of the state were flooded. Many people were rendered homeless by the floods during the months of November and December. Relief measures were announced by the government that necessitated collecting tokens from authorities in different centres across the city. The government centres were distributing 2,000, 10 kg of rice, dhotis and saris to the people affected by the floods. The relief measures were to be originally distributed from the ration shop in the area, but the street being narrow, the venue was changed to Arignar Anna Government School. On Saturday 17 December 2005, the day before the accident, 3,452 families were issued tokens and the authorities were planning to distribute for 4,5000 families on Sunday. The announcement was made with the help of public addressing system. The accident On 18 December 2005, Sunday, around 4,500 people were gathered around the Arignar Anna Government High school in MGR Nagar where the tokens to the relief measures were about to be distributed for people under the jurisdiction of three ration shops. The people assembled from 3 a.m., while the relief was planned to be distributed at 9 a.m. There was a sudden downpour at 3:45 a.m., and there were rumours that the relief measures would be given only on first come first basis to 1,000 families. At around 4 a.m, people broke through the cordons set up by police to enter the building. There was a concrete slope at the entrance and people at the front end of the queue slipped and others stumbled over them. The gates were closed with difficulty, but by then the stampede caused 42 deaths and 37 injuries. Eyewitness claimed that the sudden downpour resulted in chaos in the area. The police were few in number to control the large crowd. They also claimed that the police controlling the crowd early during the day would have averted the situation. Aftermath The stampede is counted among the twenty deadliest stampedes during the period of 1968‚Äì2005.Coppola 2005, p. 105 The President of India, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam, condoled the death of the people who lost their lives in the tragedy. On account of the poor lighting and rain, the rescue personnel found it difficult to reach the spot. The crowd did not disperse without understanding the seriousness of the situation and only left after an announcement was made that the distribution would be made at their doors. Umbrellas, footwear and ration cards were strewn all over the place. Sixteen of the injured were admitted to the government hospital and eleven, including six women, were admitted to the Royapettah Government Hospital. The Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, J. Jayalalithaa visited the injured in the hospital. During her interaction with the media after her hospital visit, she said that this might have been the handiwork of some of the miscreants trying to tarnish the image of the government. She stated that \\"There was no need for people to come in so early during the day when it had been announced that relief distribution would begin from 9 am. We had made elaborate arrangement by restricting the number of relief-seekers to 500 at each of the nine counters and deployed heavy security. It was announced that everyone would get relief,\\". The Tamil Nadu police said that it was raining heavily during the distribution of relief supplies. The state government also announced a compensation of one lakh for all the victims and 15,000 for the injured. The leader of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) party Muthuvel Karunanidhi, accused the government of buying votes by distributing freebies for the forthcoming elections. He also added that it was the poor administration of the government that resulted in the tragedy. His son, M. K. Stalin, an MLA from the DMK party, accused the government of not setting up a committee to monitor the relief measures. As a mark of respect to those who died in the accident, the shops in the area closed at 2 p.m. on the day. Investigation The police arrested Dhanasekaran, the areas' councillor who belonged to the opposing DMK party, on 20 December 2005 on charges of spreading rumours. He was charged under IPC sections 120-B for criminal conspiracy, 147 for punishment for rioting, 304 for punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, 109 for abetment, 323 for voluntarily causing hurt and 325 voluntarily causing grievous hurt. It was alleged that he and his supporters roamed around the previous evening announcing that Sunday would be the last day and token distribution would begin by 5 a.m. He argued in a lower court that he was politically targeted and the tragedy was because of an administrative failure. He quoted the transfer of Chennai collector and police officials involved in the case to support his argument. He was granted bail by the court on 26 December. He was charged in Goodas Act before the court could grant bail. He was granted bail by the Madras High Court on 5 January. The government filed a special leave petition against the order in the Supreme Court of India on 27 January 2006, but the court rejected the plea and accused the government of negligence. The court stated that \\"The incident occurred because of the negligence of your officers. This is not the first time that such an incident has happened in Tamil Nadu. Repeatedly, it is happening in Tamil Nadu for such petty things,\\". The court also noted that \\"The incident was because of the officers not making preparations for providing flood relief\\". M. Karunanidhi, in a statement, claimed that it was a moral victory for the party against the hate campaign run by Jayalalitha and her All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (ADMK) government. He said \\"The Supreme Court, which was approached by the same government, has blamed the Jayalalithaa regime for the stampede. The Supreme Court judges after hearing the two sides has said that DMK Councillor Dhanasekharan was not the reason behind the stampede, but only the Tamil Nadu Government,\\". The state government appointed a one-man commission under retired justice A Raman to enquire the incident. The terms of the commission were notified on 20 December 2013 by the government that instructed the commission to probe the alleged rumours, circumstances leading to the stampede, find any shortcomings of issue of tokens and ways to avoid such incidents in future. Dhanasekaran sought a stay on the proceedings of the commission quoting \\"Witnesses are being examined at an amazing speed, and about 35 witnesses were examined on a single day. The main aim for constituting the Commission is to divert attention on the inefficient handling of flood relief by the State Government, and to obtain a report that absolves the Government of all liability. The Commission is proceeding at such a speed that it would release a report before the coming Assembly polls on May 8\\".

Presley began his career playing with the hardcore punk bands Model American and The Nerve Agents. In 2004, Presley founded the psychedelic rock band Darker My Love. In 2006 he joined The Fall, playing on the LP Reformation Post TLC, and was an occasional guest musician on the band's later albums. Since 2010, Presley has released music under the name White Fence. As of January 2019, he has released seven studio albums, two live albums, and two collaborative albums with Ty Segall under that name, as well as two albums with Cate Le Bon under the name DRINKS, and a solo album, THE WiNK, under his own name. White Fence Presley began recording music in his apartment using primitive and low cost equipment, while still a member of Darker My Love. Presley's debut White Fence album, self-titled White Fence, was recorded between 2008 and 2009. The album was released in 2010 on Make A Mess Records, receiving generally positive reviews. Presley's second album, entitled Is Growing Faith, was released in 2011 through Woodsist Records. The album continued upon Presley's lo-fi and psychedelic sound, and contained a cover of Johnny Thunders 1978 song \\"You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory.\\" The album gathered similarly positive reviews, noting Presley's developing instrumentation and experimentation. The same year, a live cassette entitled White Fence ‚Äì Live in LA, was released through the Teenage Teardrops label. The cassette was only limited to 200 copies. 2012 saw Presley release three records; two as White Fence and one in collaboration with Ty Segall. The first, Family Perfume Vol. 1, was released on April 3, 2012. The album was the first installment in a double release from Presley.

Castle Face Records released the album in various formats, such as colour vinyl and on Flexi disc. The album received positive reviews. Presley's sixth album as White Fence, For The Recently Found Innocent was released in July 2014.

It is an active Roman Catholic church in the diocese of Shrewsbury. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History St Alban's was built in 1852‚Äì53, before which the local Roman Catholics met in a nearby school that was built in 1842. The church was designed by Stephen R. Eyre and Joseph Hansom. The foundation stone was laid on 8 June 1852, and the church opened in September 1853. It was originally planned to have two aisles, but the north aisle was omitted to reduce the cost. In 1904 the steeple was partly taken down and rebuilt. In the early 20th century the north wall suffered from subsidence and had to be rebuilt together with the chancel arch in 1913‚Äì14. The church was damaged in 1941 and lost some of its fittings, including an elaborately decorated altar, statues, and some stained glass. The interior of the church was re-ordered in 1952 when the canopies were removed from the Stations of the Cross. In 1977 the sanctuary was re-ordered in accordance with the Second Vatican Council, and there was another re-ordering in 2004. Architecture The church is constructed in stone with roofs of hexagonal slates. It consists of a six-bay nave with a clerestory, a south aisle under a lean-to roof, a south porch, a chancel with a north vestry and a south Lady chapel, and a steeple at the northwest corner. The tower has angle buttresses, a west entrance above which is a niche, pairs of louvred bell openings, and a broach spire with lucarnes. On the east side of the tower is a canted stair tower with a small spire. At the west end of the nave is a four-light window with Decorated tracery. To the right of the window is a niche, and to the right of this is the three-light aisle west window. Along the south side of the aisle are two-light windows separated by buttresses, the second bay containing a gabled porch. The clerestory contains spherical triangular windows. Along the north wall are two tiers of windows, between which are buttresses rising above the eaves. The east window has four lights. Inside the church the six-bay arcade is carried on quatrefoil piers. At the west end is a wooden gallery. In the chancel is a triple sedilia, and between the chancel and the chapel is a two-bay arcade with a parclose screen. Around the walls are three-dimensional Stations of the Cross containing crowd scenes.

Hegeler I House is a historic building in LaSalle, Illinois, United States. Completed in 1904, the house was designed by Pond & Pond and is an excellent local example of Arts & Crafts architecture. History Julius W. Hegeler I was the eldest son of Edward C. Hegeler, who established a prosperous zinc smelting operation in LaSalle, Illinois. Born in 1867, Julius Hegeler studied mining engineering and joined the family business in his adulthood. He married Josephine Hulda Caesar in 1897 and had four children. In 1903, Hegeler received a plot of land from his father, across the street from the Hegeler Carus Mansion.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/223480.pdf Hegeler commissioned Pond & Pond, a leading firm in the Arts & Crafts style to design the house. It was designed in 1902 and completed in 1904, although the Hegelers only lived there for a year. In late 1905, they moved to Danville so that Hegeler could establish his own zinc smelting company with his brother Herman. Pond & Pond also designed a house for Herman, but it was demolished around 1950. The Hegeler house remained in the hands of the family until 1970. Edward T. Barnes owned the house for a decade starting in 1922 and Herman D. Carus lived there from 1945 to 1969. In 1970, the house became a meeting place for the Illinois Valley Community Arts Center. At times, the LaSalle County Youth Bureau and a local YMCA chapter also used the building. In 1984, Fred and Cynthia Carus took ownership of the house and it remained unused for twenty years. The Hegeler Carus Foundation, a non-profit organization that oversees the mansion across the street, purchased the house and restored its roof.http://www.hegelercarus.org/julius-hegeler/ The house was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places on February 18, 2009.

His father was a stockbroker and grand-master in the Freemasons. Gerry Cottle was educated at Rutlish School, Merton Park, south London and left home in 1961 at age 16 to join the Robert Brothers Circus. Circus career Cottle started by doing menial tasks, but worked his way up to have his own juggling act, billed as Gerry Melville the Teenage Juggler, and then to own his own show, which opened in July 1970, with just five performers. He established his Big Top in 1974 and ran it until 2003. By the mid-1970s the Gerry Cottle Circus was touring Britain with three shows. In 1975 he purchased a farm in Surrey to use as a winter headquarters, and lived there for 30 years. He has also presented the Moscow State Circus and Chinese State Circus in Britain. In 1995 his Circus of Horrors debuted at the Glastonbury Festival and has toured the world since then. This was a collaborative venture with Archaos, a French contemporary circus. In 2003 he auctioned off much of his circus paraphernalia in order to concentrate on running Wookey Hole caves, a tourist attraction in Somerset. In 2012 he celebrated fifty years in the business with a new show, Turbo Circus: 50 Acts In 100 Minutes, on a 31-week tour. In 2017 after losing hundreds of thousands of pounds his circus finally closed its doors for the last time in October. Animal acts Gerry Cottle‚Äôs Circus originally toured with a variety of animals including horses, zebras, elephants, lions, tigers, monkeys, and llamas. The 1980s saw an increase in public opinion against animal acts. Cottle sold his last elephant and in 1993 had a non- animal circus. In 2012 he said that he now reluctantly supports the ban on circus animal acts, which he says will improve the image of circuses in Britain. Wookey Hole After purchasing Wookey Hole Caves, a tourist attraction that featured show caves, penny arcades and restaurants, he added a theatre, circus museum, hotel and circus school. At the latter, local youth train in a wide range of circus skills, and perform at the theatre and in Cottle's new touring show, Turbo Circus. Personal life He married Betty Fossett, youngest daughter of circus showman Jim Fossett, in 1968, and has three daughters and a son. In the 1980s he became addicted to cocaine and was jailed. His daughters set up Cottle Sisters Circus. He is separated from Betty and had another partner, Anna Carter of Carters Steam Fair They have now separated .

Included within the center's plans is a new branch for the Chicago Public Library. The nonprofit Obama Foundation will oversee the center's creation and its campus's construction, and partner with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to digitize the records of Obama's presidency. In August 2018, the Chicago Park District began related construction which it suspended in September.

Michael Strautmanis became the vice-president of civic engagement for the foundation in 2016. Site selection In 2014 the library released details for institutions interested in being the location of the library. The library ultimately received bids from four institutions: *Columbia University (New York City) *University of Chicago (Chicago) *University of Illinois at Chicago (Chicago) *University of Hawaii (Honolulu) In May 2015 the library's board announced it had decided to build the library in partnership with the University of Chicago. Obama taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School from 1992 to 2004. After the library's board had selected to build the library in partnership with the University of Chicago they began deciding between two possible locations, Washington Park and Jackson Park. They ultimately selected Jackson Park. In 2018, the Obama Foundation released the proposed bid by the University of Chicago, and the three other universities. The 2014 bid revealed that the University of Chicago included various plans, such as combining the golf courses at South Shore and Jackson Park into a single ‚Äúworld class facility,‚Äù and the closing of Cornell Drive and other streets in the vicinity of Jackson Park in order to improve the connecting green space for museums located in a nearby area known as \\"Museum Campus South\\". Planning and design The University of Chicago, the University of Illinois at Chicago, the University of Hawaii, and Columbia University submitted proposals to host the institution. In May 2015, the Barack Obama Foundation and Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel announced that the foundation and the Barack Obama Presidential Center would be located in Chicago's South Side, and would be built in partnership with the University of Chicago. A design advisory committee assisted in the selection of the architects. Members of the committee included sculptor Don Gummer (the husband of actress Meryl Streep); Ed Schlossberg of ESI Design (husband of Caroline Kennedy, the former U.S. ambassador to Japan); Fred Eychaner, a Chicago radio station owner and Democratic financier; and Architectural Digest magazine editor Margaret Russell. Seven architectural firms were announced as finalists in December 2015 from an initial list of 140 applicants: John Ronan Architects, Adjaye Associates, Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Renzo Piano Building Workshop, SHoP Architects, Sn√∏hetta, and Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects. In June 2016, the foundation chose New York-based Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects and Chicago-based Interactive Design Architects to jointly lead the design and engineering of the center. For the exhibition design, Ralph Appelbaum Associates, which worked on the National Museum of African American History, will lead a team including Civic Projects, Normal, and several local artists.Obama Foundation exhibition designers Chicago Tribune The landscape architect is Michael Van Valkenburgh Associates, with Site Design Group, and Living Habitats. Lakeside Alliance, which includes Turner Construction and a consortium of local African-American owned firms: Powers & Sons Construction, UJAMAA Construction, Brown & Momen, and Safeway Construction, will build the library. Two parks near the University of Chicago's campus, Jackson Park and Washington Park, were considered. On July 29, 2016, the foundation announced the selection of portion of Jackson Park in the Woodlawn neighborhood. Jackson Park, designed by landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted for the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, already houses the Museum of Science and Industry and a golf course.Skiba, Katherine. Obama Foundation makes it official: Presidential library will go up in Jackson Park, Chicago Tribune, June 29, 2016. Preliminary plans were unveiled in May 2017, involving three buildings in geometric shapes covered in light-colored stone, roughly . The museum building (which will also include educational and meeting space) will be the tallest at . The other buildings, a library building and a forum building, will be a single story. The latter building will feature an auditorium, a restaurant, and a public garden. The library will be \\"the first completely digital presidential library in the country, with no paper records stored on site\\"--papers will be stored at a separate National Archives and Records Administration facility. In 2018, the center announced an agreement to place a Chicago Public Library branch within the complex. The unveiled plan incorporates the Jackson Park end of Midway Plaisance from the north (which would be readapted as a circular green space surrounding a water basin), and the entirety of the park's hockey field and adjoining parkland to the south, where the main buildings and new park landscaping are to be sited. As part of a wider plan to reclaim parkland and improve park safety, the project also necessitates the closure, between 60th and 67th streets, of South Cornell Drive, a 6-lane thoroughfare that runs along the western park lagoon and the park's golf course from Midway Plaisance to South Shore. Without improvements to other roadways that will accommodate local traffic, these closures will result in nine intersections in the area to operate over capacity causing substantial traffic delays. These infrastructure changes would not be paid for by the Obama Foundation, and would require government funding, expected to cost the city $175 million.  Local reaction = Community Benefits Agreement  The Obama Library South Side Community Benefits Agreement Coalition, a coalition of 19 community and activist groups, is seeking a community benefits agreement to require that the Obama Foundation, in partnership with the City of Chicago, sets aside jobs for residents in the local communities, protect low-income housing and home owners, support and create Black businesses, and strengthen neighborhood schools. Some residents have concerns about rising property taxes and rents that could displace many of the low-income Black residents. Recent rent increases for residents living directly across from the library site escalated concerns of displacement of residents, particularly those who have fixed incomes, and has drawn protests against local Aldermen who are in opposition of a community benefits agreement. As of 2018, the Obama Foundation has so far refused to consider a community benefits agreement. The foundation has announced plans for community hiring. An economic impact assessment estimates that about 28% of the 4,945 short-term construction jobs would go to South Side residents, with the remainder to the rest of Cook County. About 2,175 of the 2,536 long-term jobs would to go South Side residents, with the remainder to residents in rest of Cook County. It is estimated that the long-term jobs will bring in about $104 million in annual income to Cook County residents, or about $41,000 per job. In July 2019, local aldermen Jeanette Taylor and Leslie Hairston introduced an ordinance aimed at protecting affordable housing near the development. The ordinance would require 30% of new units built in a 2 mile radius of the development to be affordable and offer right of first refusal for nearby tenants, among other benefits. The ordinance earned support from nearly 30 aldermen in Chicago City Council. In January 2020, Mayor Lori Lightfoot's administration announced that it would support a scaled-back version of a Community Benefits Agreement ordinance, but Taylor re-iterated support for the original ordinance. In July 2020, the Lightfoot administration and aldermen Taylor agreed on a compromise ordinance that went further than the administration's earlier proposal. The compromise ordinance would require that 30% of units on 52 city-owned lots in Woodlawn be reserved for residents making between 30% and 50% of the Area Median Income, that any building refinanced through the Preservation of Existing Affordable Rentals program must reserve 10% of units for those making less than 30% of the AMI and 10% for those making less than 50% of the AMI, that the city's Housing Department request $675,000 in federal funds to support a local program to promote homeownership among current residents, and that eligibility restrictions be loosened for Woodlawn‚Äôs Home Improvement Grant Program. The compromise was reached after negotiations between the administration, aldermen Taylor and Hairston, the CBA Coalition, and other community groups. Taylor called the compromise ordinance a \\"step in the right direction\\" and, along with members of the CBA coalition, called for further action.  Public land  The selection of the South Side has broad local support for reasons of civic pride as well as of the economic development it would bring in the form of jobs and development. The nonprofit group Friends of the Parks opposes the loss of parkland to build the center and had threatened a lawsuit to block development. In May 2018, the preservationist group \\"Protect Our Parks\\" filed a lawsuit, to prevent the part of Jackson Park, which dates from 1893, from being taken from the public and given to a private entity. Mayor Emanuel was critical of the lawsuit. Later that month, the plan to build the center was approved by the Chicago Plan Commission. In early August 2018, the Chicago Park District began cutting trees to relocate park facilities, with the most notable being the Jackson Park athletic field. On September 17, 2018, the Chicago Park District suspended its construction related to the Center following meetings with the National Park Service and the Federal Highway Administration. On September 18, 2018, it was announced that the Center will be owned by the city of Chicago once completed and that the Obama Foundation will not receive the tax-based operating or capital support, nor the perpetual leases which the 11 other museums in the city parks obtain. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel submitted two ordinances to the Chicago City Council on September 20: the first would grant the Obama Foundation a 99-year lease on the Jackson Park site for $10.00 with various restrictions on the Foundation's use, in return for the Foundation's financial responsibility for maintaining and operating the city-owned project; the second allows the city to plow under Cornell Drive from 59th Street to Hayes Drive in order to reconfigure this area as green space. The Chicago Department of Planning and Development (DPD) ordinance amends a 2015 agreement with the park district concerning the Obama Presidential Center. Under the new ordinance, the Presidential Center will comply with the Museum Act's free admission days requirements. Parking fees for the Center will also be regulated so they are consistent with the rates charged at the Museum of Science and Industry or in the North Garage adjacent to the Field Museum. The ordinance will also ensure that these parking fees may solely be used to finance the Center's operations, maintenance, management, and endowment funding. On October 31, 2018, the Chicago city council unanimously approved the new proposals for the Obama Presidential Center. Mayor Emanuel afterwards read a letter of thanks written by former President Obama. On October 24, 2018, U.S. District Judge John Robert Blakey held a status conference in the lawsuit filed by the group Protect Our Parks to prevent construction in Jackson Park. Blakey indicated that both sides want a quick resolution and the court will not delay the lawsuit. The city informed the court that they intend to seek a motion to dismiss after action by the City Council. Discovery continued during the next few months. On November 23, 2018, a motion was filed by the city of Chicago to dismiss the Protect Our Parks lawsuit. This request was denied on February 19, 2019 by Judge Blakey. While it did not guarantee the challenge would ultimately win in court, the ruling allowed the lawsuit to proceed. On June 11, 2019, Judge Blakey ruled on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgement and granted judgement in favor of the City and against Protect our Parks, dismissing the lawsuit to block construction of the Obama Presidential Center in Jackson Park.  Other reactions  Some faculty members signed a letter stating concerns about the design, raised questions about the estimated cost of transportation improvements, and stated that the plan is an \\"object-lesson in the mistakes of the past\\". A counter-letter in support of the Obama Center was signed by other University of Chicago faculty in response. The independent campus student newspaper, The Chicago Maroon wrote an editorial in support of the library that criticized the concerns raised by some faculty. Construction and fundraising Construction of the center was originally expected to begin in late 2018 and be completed in 2020 or 2021. A federal review of the project began in late 2017, responding to the local criticism and attempting to assess whether the project affects Jackson Park's status on the National Register of Historic Places.Sweet, Lynn. \\"Feds launch review of Obama Presidential Center impact on Jackson Park\\", Chicago Sun-Times, November 26, 2017.

On July 27, 2018, the Obama Foundation announced that groundbreaking for the Center would be delayed until sometime in 2019, and the center would not open in 2021, as was initially planned. The Foundation's 2017 annual report, and its 2017 IRS filing, show that the Obama Foundation raised $232.6 million, on expenses of $23 million. The year after Obama left office was the first year the Foundation lifted a cap on donations. While it lists its donors on its website, it no longer specifically links donors to exact amounts. While the Chicago city government has not promised that the Foundation's endowment details will be disclosed publicly, its agreement with the Foundation requires that the Foundation may not proceed with construction of the Center until the building endowment is secured.

He serves as Metropolitan of Chi≈üinƒÉu and All Moldova and thus as first hierarch of the Church of Moldova and as a permanent member of the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church. Life Nicolae Cantarean was born in Kolinkivtsi, Khotyn Raion, in the west of the Ukrainian SSR, part of the historical region of Bessarabia, nowadays bordering northern Moldova. Born into a working-class family, in 1969 Nicolae graduated from secondary school and, in 1970, from vocational school. He served in the Soviet Army from 1970 until 1973, after which he began working in the administration of the Eparchy of Smolensk. On May 22, 1974, Nicolae was ordained as a celibate deacon, and then on May 22, 1976, as a celibate priest in Smolensk's Cathedral of the Dormition. In 1981 Hieromonk Nicolae graduated from the Moscow Theological Seminary and was appointed to serve at the Cathedral of St. Nicholas in Chernivtsi the same year. From 1983 Fr. Nicolae also served as secretary of the administration of the Eparchy of Chernivtsi and Bukovina. On November 29, 1987, Fr. Nicolae was tonsured a monk with the name of Vladimir, and in 1988 was elevated to the rank of archimandrite. In 1989 Archimandrite Vladimir graduated from the Moscow Theological Academy, and on July 21, 1989, was consecrated Bishop of Chi≈üinƒÉu and Moldova at Holy Theophany Cathedral in Moscow. On April 4, 1990, Bishop Vladimir was elevated to the rank of archbishop, and on December 21, 1992, to the rank of metropolitan as head of the newly autonomous Moldovan Orthodox Church. At the Russian Orthodox Council of Bishops in August 2000 Metropolitan Vladimir was elected a permanent member of the Russian Orthodox Holy Synod.

Completed in 1907, the hall exemplifies early 20th- century trends in city management. History The idea of a new city building for LaSalle, Illinois came from Walter A. Panneck, who served as mayor from 1903 to 1909. However, the city treasury did not have the funds to match Panneck's vision. To raise enough money for the structure, 450 bonds of $100 were issued, 422 of which were sold. The building was designed by Victor Andre Matteson, a relatively obscure architect who previously worked under Frost & Granger. All city departments were consolidated into this one building, a popular trend during the Progressivism movement. The building was recognized by the National Park Service with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places on August 29, 1985.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/201399.pdf Architecture The symmetrical two and a half story building is largely rectangular. It was built with red brick with Bedford limestone trim. Balustrades and modillions are detailed with galvanized iron and tin. The main entrance is a double door on the south, facing Second Street, while a second public entrance faces Joliet Street on the east. There is also a private entrance, used by the police department, facing an alley to the north. Fanlight windows are found over each entrance, though the exterior of each has been covered with a panel. The first floor has a central hall plan and is home to the police department. A jail was originally part of the police wing, but has since been converted to office use. Although the police wing has been extensively modified from its original design, the public hall closely resembles the original plan. The city engineer's office is on the second floor and council chambers are on the third. A basement, originally small and intended only for a furnace, has been greatly expanded.

Symptoms may include a decreased level of consciousness, poor or no coordination, vomiting, abdominal pain, and a specific smell on the breath. Decreased vision may start as early as twelve hours after exposure. Long-term outcomes may include blindness and kidney failure. Toxicity and death may occur even after drinking a small amount. Methanol poisoning most commonly occurs following the drinking of windshield washer fluid. This may be accidental or as part of an attempted suicide. Toxicity may also rarely occur through extensive skin exposure or breathing in fumes. When methanol is broken down by the body it results in formaldehyde, formic acid, and formate which cause much of the toxicity. The diagnosis may be suspected when there is acidosis or an increased osmol gap and confirmed by directly measuring blood levels. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include infections, exposure to other toxic alcohols, serotonin syndrome, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Early treatment increases the chance of a good outcome. Treatment consists of stabilizing the person, followed by the use of an antidote. The preferred antidote is fomepizole, with ethanol used if this is not available. Hemodialysis may also be used in those where there is organ damage or a high degree of acidosis. Other treatments may include sodium bicarbonate, folate, and thiamine. Outbreaks of methanol ingestion have occurred due to contamination of drinking alcohol. This is more common in the developing world. In 2013 more than 1700 cases occurred in the United States. Those affected are usually adult and male. Toxicity to methanol has been described as early as 1856. Signs and symptoms The initial symptoms of methanol intoxication include central nervous system depression, headache, dizziness, nausea, lack of coordination, and confusion. Sufficiently large doses cause unconsciousness and death. The initial symptoms of methanol exposure are usually less severe than the symptoms from the ingestion of a similar quantity of ethanol. Once the initial symptoms have passed, a second set of symptoms arises, from 10 to as many as 30 hours after the initial exposure, that may include blurring or complete loss of vision, acidosis, and putaminal hemorrhages, an uncommon but serious complication. These symptoms result from the accumulation of toxic levels of formate in the blood, and may progress to death by respiratory failure. Physical examination may show tachypnea, and eye examination may show dilated pupils with hyperemia of the optic disc and retinal edema. Cause Methanol has a high toxicity in humans. As little as 10 mL of pure methanol when drunk is metabolized into formic acid, which can cause permanent blindness by destruction of the optic nerve. 15 mL is potentially fatal, although the median lethal dose is typically 100 mL (3.4 fl oz) (i.e. 1‚Äì2 mL/kg body weight of pure methanol). Reference dose for methanol is 0.5 mg/kg/day.Methanol (CASRN 67-56-1) Ethanol is sometimes denatured (adulterated), and made poisonous, by the addition of methanol. The result is known as methylated spirit, \\"meths\\" (British use) or \\"metho\\" (Australian slang). This is not to be confused with \\"meth\\", a common abbreviation for methamphetamine and for methadone in Britain and the United States. Mechanism Methanol is toxic by two mechanisms. First, methanol (whether it enters the body by ingestion, inhalation, or absorption through the skin) can be fatal due to its CNS depressant properties in the same manner as ethanol poisoning. Second, in a process of toxication, it is metabolized to formic acid (which is present as the formate ion) via formaldehyde in a process initiated by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase in the liver. Methanol is converted to formaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase and formaldehyde is converted to formic acid (formate) via aldehyde dehydrogenase. The conversion to formate via ALDH proceeds completely, with no detectable formaldehyde remaining. Formate is toxic because it inhibits mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase, causing hypoxia at the cellular level, and metabolic acidosis, among a variety of other metabolic disturbances. Treatment Methanol poisoning can be treated with fomepizole, or if unavailable, ethanol. Both drugs act to reduce the action of alcohol dehydrogenase on methanol by means of competitive inhibition. Ethanol, the active ingredient in alcoholic beverages, acts as a competitive inhibitor by more effectively binding and saturating the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme in the liver, thus blocking the binding of methanol. Methanol is excreted by the kidneys without being converted into the very toxic metabolites formaldehyde and formic acid. Alcohol dehydrogenase instead enzymatically converts ethanol to acetaldehyde, a much less toxic organic molecule.Voet, Donald, Judith G. Voet, and Charlotte W. Pratt. Fundamentals of Biochemistry: Life at the Molecular Level. 5th ed. Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2008. Print Additional treatment may include sodium bicarbonate for metabolic acidosis, and hemodialysis or hemodiafiltration to remove methanol and formate from the blood. Folinic acid or folic acid is also administered to enhance the metabolism of formate. History There are cases of methanol resistance, such as that of Mike Malloy, whom someone tried and failed to poison by methanol in the early 1930s.Blum, Deborah (2011). The Poisoner's Handbook. Penguin Books. p. 231. . In December 2016, 78 people died in Irkutsk, Russia from methanol poisoning after ingesting a counterfeit body lotion that was primarily methanol rather than ethanol as labeled. The body lotion, prior to the event, had been used as a cheap substitute for vodka by the impoverished people in the region despite warnings on the lotion's bottles that it was not safe for drinking and long-standing problems with alcohol poisoning across the country. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Iranian media reported that nearly 300 people had died and over a thousand became ill due to methanol poisoning in the belief that drinking the alcohol could help with the disease. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration discovered that a number of brands of hand sanitizer manufactured in Mexico during the pandemic contained methanol, and urged the public to avoid using the affected products.

Facebook Paper was the first product of Facebook Creative Labs. Later on more apps were launched: Slingshot, Mentions, Rooms, Facebook Groups, Riff, Hello and Moments. Features Some of the stated features of Facebook Paper that distinguish it from Facebook's past efforts and its other apps: * The use of a grid structure to have a large amount of content discoverable by scrolling without overwhelming the reader in any one display. * The use of tilting as a separate gesture used to load high- resolution photos, play videos, and load more details of status updates. Tilting is distinguishing from finger-based scrolling, that simply goes to the next item in the grid. * A magazine-like texture in the display. * A mix of curation by editors and the use of social signals (including Facebook likes and shares) in deciding what content to show. Content is not limited to content from friends. However, this may not be that different from Flipboard and other news aggregation services. Facebook Paper has also experimented with content collaboration with third parties. The first such collaboration was with TED, and was announced on March 17, 2014. Reception Rachel Meltz, writing for Technology Review, wrote that Facebook Paper was better than Facebook's main app and contrasted it favorably with Facebook's previous efforts at mobile, such as Facebook Home. Dieter Bohn, writing for The Verge, similarly said that with Paper, Facebook \\"blew its own iPhone app out of the water.\\" Ellis Hamburger reviewed Facebook Paper in a video review as well as an article for The Verge, calling it \\"the best Facebook app ever.\\" Kyle Vanhemert reviewed the app in Wired Magazine, writing: \\"The most radical aspect of Paper is that it isn‚Äôt predicated entirely on your friends.\\" Josh Constine wrote for TechCrunch: \\"This ain‚Äôt your mama‚Äôs Facebook. Paper is almost too modern, or maybe it‚Äôs just years ahead of its time.\\" Semil Shah, writing for TechCrunch, reviewed Paper in light of Facebook's broader mobile strategy, wondering whether Paper's fate would be similar to that of the fairly successful Facebook Messenger or the highly unsuccessful Facebook Poke (Facebook's in-house Snapchat clone). Jennifer Van Grove discussed Paper and the importance of Facebook Creative Labs in Facebook's long-term strategy in an article for CNet. Lance Ulanoff, writing for Mashable, wrote that although Facebook Paper was content-focused, Facebook was still trying to distinguish itself from a media company and was focused on enabling people to create content rather than simply focused on the reading experience. Matt Buchanan wrote in The New Yorker that \\"Facebook's move away from the stream is part of what seems to be a shift toward flexibility and experimentation\\" and that \\"[Paper] shows that the company finally thinks that it knows us well enough to show us everything one piece a time.\\" Inside Facebook published \\"10 first reactions\\" to Facebook Paper describing what it revealed about Facebook. FiftyThree, Inc. the maker of a sketchbook app also called Paper, contacted Facebook asking them to not use the Paper name so as to avoid brand confusion. Comparison with Flipboard An article by Jason Abbruzzese in Mashable noted the similarities of Facebook Paper with existing news reading and aggregation services such as Flipboard, and sought reactions from existing news reading services on whether they considered Facebook Paper a threat to their business model. Karissa Bell later wrote an article for Mashable comparing Facebook Paper and Flipboard on a number of aspects. The following differences were noted between Facebook Paper and Flipboard, shortly after the launch of Paper in February 2014: * Flipboard gives more prominence to content, whereas Facebook Paper gives more prominence to social actions, such as interacting with friends and sharing with one's timeline. * Flipboard is more of an aggregator, giving users considerable flexibility in what sources they can use to construct their own newspaper. Facebook Paper, on the other hand, is a curator‚Äîthe permissible news categories and the sources within each category are chosen by Facebook, and users' main flexibility is in choosing which of Facebook's predefined sections is of interest to them. * Facebook Paper puts discovery first, telling users what stories they need to pay attention to * Facebook Paper only integrates with Facebook, whereas Flipboard integrates with other venues for sharing including Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and LinkedIn. Facebook no longer makes users' newsfeeds available in Flipboard other than content from followed pages and groups. * Facebook Paper is only available for the iPhone, whereas Flipboard is available for the iPhone, iPad, Android, Windows Phone 8, BlackBerry, Kindle Fire, Nook and web. Further progress In April 2014, about 2.5 months after the release of Facebook Paper, Facebook announced that Paper users browse 80 stories a day, and that Facebook had made changes that allowed people to use Facebook Paper in place of the Facebook iOS app. In late April 2014, Facebook open-sourced the animation engine that powered Facebook Paper.  Discontinuation  On June 30, 2016, Facebook announced that support for Paper will end, and users will no longer be able to log into the app after July 29, 2016.

His travels early in his adulthood led him to Peoria, Illinois, where he traded for the American Fur Company. He served one term in the Illinois House of Representatives and then two terms in the Illinois Senate. Biography John Hamlin was born on October 25, 1800, in Hampden County, Massachusetts to John and Lucy Hamlin. He worked on a farm when he was a child and attended some schooling. When he was sixteen, he joined his brother's business, selling goods from a traveling wagon. Three years later, the brothers had sold all of their wares and sold the wagon. Hamlin moved frequently in the subsequent years, staying at times in Massachusetts, New York, Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. He set out for another sojourn to Missouri, but on his way, he decided to stay at Logan County, Illinois (then Sangamon County). Settling near James Latham's farm in Elkhart, Hamlin worked Latham's land for a year. In 1821, Hamlin joined a keelboat operation on the Sangamon River, selling goods to settlements on the river. That May, Hamlin decided to build a pair of log cabins in Peoria and permanently settle. When Fulton County was formed in 1822, Hamlin was elected its first justice of the peace. He took a contract the next year to supply Fort Howard in Wisconsin with beef. He became associated with the American Fur Company after a visit to Fort Dearborn. He used his house in Fort Clark as a trading post, often trading with Native Americans. He opened a store in Peoria in 1825 and established a branch in Mackinawtown in 1828. A year after Peoria County was founded in 1825, Hamlin was elected county commissioner. He served a two-year term and was later was elected to another two-year term in 1830, although he resigned before it was completed. Hamlin donated a log cabin to serve as the first Peoria County Courthouse in March 1829. Four years later, he was commissioned to provide rock and timber for the first permanent courthouse. In 1829, Hamlin sold his other business interests to co-founded the first flour mill in the area with John Sharp, which ran for five years. He bought a steamboat, the S. B. Triton which he renamed the Peoria, and operated it between Peoria and St. Louis, Missouri, the first such boat on the Illinois River. In Peoria, Hamlin served on the board of trustees and as an alderman. In 1834, he was elected as a Whig to the Illinois House of Representatives. After a two-year term, he was elected to the Illinois Senate, where he was re-elected two years later. Later in his life he joined the Second National Bank of Peoria as a director. He co- founded the Savings Bank of Peoria with seven other investors in 1868. He died on March 29, 1876 and was buried in Springdale Cemetery.

Family and Youth Chelva Jos√© Mar√≠a Valiente Soriano was born in the small Valencian town of Chelva to a petty bourgeoisie family; the son of Jos√© Valiente y Soriano and Micaela Soriano Alcaide, he had two sisters. His father was working as a notary; following his professional lot, the Valientes moved to Madrid during the last decades of the Restauraci√≥n. Jos√© Mar√≠a studied law first at the Universidad Central (later Universidad Complutense) in Madrid, to continue his juridical research with postgraduate doctoral thesis at the prestigious Universit√† di Bologna (where he met Ram√≥n Serrano S√∫√±er, who was also studying jurisprudence). Valiente focused on the banking law and graduated cum laude in 1923. He commenced the career of a lawyer and an academic specialising in civil law at the faculty of law at the Universidad de Zaragoza, later to be also employed by the Universidad de Sevilla and the Universidad de la Laguna on the Canary Islands. Married to Cantabrian aristocrat Consuelo Seti√©n Rodr√≠guez; the couple had three children. Christian politician Secular republican propaganda In 1927, Valiente set up Juventud Cat√≥lica de Espa√±a, the ostensibly apolitical grouping concerned with defence and dissemination of Catholic values among the youth; in 1931 it was federated with Acci√≥n Cat√≥lica, a broad organization of lay Catholics led by √Ångel Herrera Oria. Later the same year, once the militantly secular course of the Republic began to take shape, he moved to politics by co-founding Acci√≥n Nacional (which in 1932 changed its name to Acci√≥n Popular), a broad though heterogeneous conservative alliance, and became the vicepresident of its first National Committee. Since Acci√≥n Catolica banned its members from holding political party leadership roles, Valiente had to resign from the JCE leadership. In 1933, Valiente proceeded to build the Acci√≥n Popular youth organisation, Juventudes de Acci√≥n Popular, and became its president. Soon afterwards AP transformed itself into Confederaci√≥n Espa√±ola de Derechas Aut√≥nomas. JAP, now forming a juvenile branch of CEDA, retained its name and structure; Valiente continued to lead the organisation and became one of the national CEDA chieftains. Under his guidance, Juventudes became an aggressively anti-Lefist and pro-authoritarian group, though falling short of a typical \\"shirt organization\\" and denying similarity to Fascism. During the 1933 elections to the Cortes, Valiente, thanks to his Cantabrian family links, negotiated a place on the local Uni√≥n de Derechas Agrarias list of candidates and was comfortably elected from the Santander-Cantabria district.Alfonso XIII In early 1934, Valiente at least twice secretly travelled to France to speak with Alfonso XIII. His aim was to negotiate the terms of modus vivendi between the monarchists and the accidentalist CEDA, and specifically to ask that for the time being the deposed king refrains from any statements that might impair CEDA's political fortunes. It is not exactly clear to what extent this mission was agreed with the party leader Jos√© Gil- Robles, since the two gave conflicting accounts of the incident, but it is usually accepted that the latter was at least approvingly aware. When the news of the Fontainebleau talks leaked to the press CEDA, the party which despite repeated declarations of loyalty towards the Republic was customarily accused of anti-Republican designs by the Left, found itself cornered and embarrassed. Eventually, the official version adopted by CEDA presented the incident as a monarchist plot within the organization. Valiente, apparently with his consent, was made a scapegoat and was expelled from the party. It is not unlikely that the militancy of JAP, perceived by the more acquiescent cedistas as compromising, might have contributed to the harsh line taken against Valiente. He had to leave JAP as well, replaced as its leader by Jos√© Mar√≠a Perez de Laborda. Dissenting Carlist The Carlist standard In late 1935, amid a blaze of publicity, Valiente decided to join Comuni√≥n Tradicionalista. For the Carlists, he was a valuable acquisition. The JAP militancy and the monarchist episode, embarrassing to the loyalist CEDA, were welcome credentials for the Traditionalists, who made little secret of their intention to do away with the godless regime as soon as possible. During the 1936 elections to the Cortes, he ran on the Carlist ticket from the rather conservative Burgos constituency and was elected. His political standing on the national political scene was demonstrated when Valiente carried the coffin at the funeral of Jos√© Calvo Sotelo. During the anti-Republican conspiracy, Valiente's role was reduced to negotiations with the would-be Alfonsist allies in the Burgos province, where he resided during the coup of July 18. He became member of the Junta Nacional Carlista de Guerra, where he took care of religious affairs. When Franco expulsed the Carlist leader Manuel Fal Conde from Spain, Valiente acted as his informal substitute. In 1937, facing Franco's pressure to unite the Carlists and Falange, he shared neither the alacrity of Conde Rodezno nor the intransigence of Fal Conde. As one of 11 Carlists he entered the 50-member Consejo Nacional of the new organization (though not the Junta Politica) and assumed the Burgos province jefatura, resigning his post in the Junta de Guerra. More than amalgamation within a motley grouping artificially created by the military, he feared the breakup of Carlism into rodeznistas and falcondistas. Don Juan Having personal authorisation of the regent-claimant Don Javier, Valiente remained in the Falangist Consejo Nacional (until 1942), but he refused the offer of Rodezno, who assumed the Ministry of Justice in the first Francoist cabinet of 1938 and asked Valiente to be his sub-secretary (the post went to Luis Arellano instead). Until 1942, when Franco ignored Don Javier's proposal of forming a Carlist-Francoist government, Valiente seemed to hope for a compromise, but he switched to opposition against Francoism later on. In 1945, following the Carlist anti-Francoist demonstrations in Pamplona, he was detained and expected facing the firing squad; eventually the sanctions adopted were relatively mild, especially compared to the terror employed against the Left. As one of the key mid-age Carlist followers of Don Javier and his Jefe Delegado Fal Conde, Valiente was courted by Conde Rodezno. The latter invited him to join the juanistas, the group notionally loyal to the regency, but pressing the candidacy of Don Juan, the Alfonsist claimant, as the prospective Carlist king. Valiente refused to adhere; he also ignored the much smaller faction advocating the claim of Karl Pius Habsburg, styled as Carlos VIII and seemingly popular with some sections of the Falange. Valiente also remained loyal to Don Javier but became less enthusiastic in 1952, when the latter decided to end the regency and announced his own claim to the throne. Collaborative Carlist Francisco Franco Around the mid-1950s, the growing feeling among the javieristas was that the intransigent opposition, pursued by Manuel Fal Conde, produced few if any results. Don Javier seemed to agree. Following the resignation of Fal Conde, in 1955 he created Secretar√≠a Nacional, a new collegial governing body of the movement, naming Valiente its president. Consistently opposing the plans of monarchical union, pursued by Jos√© Mar√≠a Arauz de Robles, Valiente engineered a more collaborative approach towards Francoism. The time seemed particularly opportune in 1957, when totalitarian plans of the Falangist leader Jos√© Arrese were rejected by Franco; the dictator started to make references to Traditionalism and to movimiento-comuni√≥n. The law on Principios Fundamentales del Movimiento, adopted in 1958, declared Spain to be a Monarqu√≠a Tradicional. The new strategy of posibilismo was welcomed with mixed feelings among the Carlists; older regional junteros grumbled and a young Navarrese, disguised as a priest, assaulted Valiente in a Pamplona street. His key ally against the internal opposition turned out to be the son of Don Javier, Carlos Hugo, who made a fulminant Pr√≠ncipe de Asturias entry at the 1957 annual Carlist Montejurra amassment. The prince, greeted with exploding enthusiasm of the youth, delivered his La Proclama de Montejurra which, apart from social novelties, presaged modernization of the party and a more activist policy, which might have been interpreted as an offer to Franco. As Carlos Hugo moved permanently from France to Madrid, his cooperation with Valiente went well, resulting in Valiente's nomination to Jefe Delegado in 1960. Don Javier Initially, the rapprochement, masterminded by Valiente and the leading hugocarlista Ram√≥n Mass√≥, looked promising. The socially radical Falangist leaders, Jos√© Sol√≠s Ruiz and Raimundo Fern√°ndez-Cuesta, started to frequent Carlist meetings. Valiente had long audiences with Franco in 1961 and 1962, hearing from the dictator that he had not decided on his succession yet; Carlos Hugo was personally admitted to the Caudillo later. Franco allowed formation of C√≠rculos Culturales V√°zquez de Mella, semi-official Carlist offices, and authorized a few new Carlist periodicals. However, any other tangible results failed to materialize. The prince was ultimately denied the Spanish citizenship, no javierista Carlist landed any key position (though Valiente was rumored to take Ministry of Justice) and the regime failed to take a traditionalist turn. Valiente, dubbed \\"the strong man of Carlism\\" in the late 1950s, was gradually losing ground within the Comuni√≥n. In 1962, he had to share power with the new Secretar√≠a Pol√≠tica, directed by Mass√≥. In 1963, Zavala assumed presidency of the Junta de Gobierno, a new executive Carlist body, leaving Valiente with still less powers of Jefe Delegado. Valiente was quoted saying there are many horses racing; we control neither the pace nor direction, but we have to run, an expression of his growing skepticism. Among the Carlists the frustration with the apparently unproductive collaborationist strategy was already rife. The policy crashed altogether when Valiente submitted his resignation in 1967, and Carlos Hugo was expulsed from Spain in 1968. In early 1968 Valiente was replaced as the highest Carlist executive by Juan Jos√© Palomino Jim√©nez. Traditionalist Carlist With princess Irene, Madrid 1967 In the mid-1960s, the differences over posibilismo were becoming a function of an even more fundamental conflict. Valiente was alarmed when he noticed that the social radicalism of Carlos Hugo was losing its pro-Falangist tone and was taking an increasingly Marxist turn instead. The Basque question proved to be another field of discontent. In the late 1960s, the young hugocarlistas already controlled the Carlist student organization Agrupaci√≥n Escolar Tradicionalista (AET), the trade-unionist Movimiento Obrero Tradicionalista (MOT) and the new militia Grupos de Accion Carlista (GAC), and launched an open bid for control. The campaign, shrewdly engineered by Mass√≥, accused the older leaders of over-committing to Francoism; the Civil-War Requet√© leader Jos√© Luis Zamanillo was ousted and Valiente was left outmanoeuvred. Always loyal to Don Javier and usually enjoying his support in return, he was gradually estranged by the aging claimant, who accepted his resignation as Jefe Delegado in 1968. Despite his decline, Valiente maintained cordial relations with Don Javier. It changed when Valiente was designated to the Cortes as Franco's personal appointee. In what was an odd twist-and-turn of the failed collaborationist policy, the dictator decided to play Valiente against Carlos Hugo and to strengthen his position by making him a parliamentary deputy. Don Javier demanded that the nominee decline the assignment, but Valiente was already determined to confront the Left-bound hugocarlistas. In a personal letter to the claimant, dated November 1970, he underlined his loyalty to the Traditionalist principles, implicitly suggesting that it was Don Javier who might have abandoned them. The open conflict lasted until 1971, but Valiente failed to gather enough support. At that time, the generation change within Carlism has already occurred. The Civil War leaders either died or due to their age were politically inactive; the Civil War rank- and-file were approaching retirement. The movement was gradually taken over by members who hardly remembered the Civil War and were raised in the Francoist Spain. With their support, during the series of Los Congresos del Pueblo Carlista, Carlos Hugo transformed the movement into Carlist Party, adopted the titoist socialismo autogestionario platform and got Valiente expelled. When he joined the next Cortes in 1971, Valiente was already representing himself only. Juancarlista Prince of Spain In 1969, Franco formally designated Juan Carlos de Borb√≥n as his successor. Valiente considered the young prince an acceptable future king, a leader loyal to the traditional conservative values and averse to liberal democratic ideas, apparently nurtured by his father, thought to be an opportunist. In 1972, he addressed the successor-in- waiting with a letter, suggesting it was a favorable moment to build a conservative monarchy departing from the Francoist model. Following relaxation of the law on political organizations, Valiente started working around a new broadly based monarchist party, possibly with titular presidency of Juan Carlos. The organization eventually materialized in 1975 as Uni√≥n Nacional Espa√±ola, co-founded with Zamanillo, Antonio de Oriol and Miguel Fagoaga, though falling dramatically short of the original designs and missing the royal support. Valiente welcomed the dismantling of Francoism, though not in the democratic direction eventually adopted during the transici√≥n. His new party, founded on the conservative, monarchist and Catholic basis, failed to gain popular support. UNE formed part of the broad right-of-the-centre Alianza Popular. In the 1977 elections, AP arrived fourth with 8% of the votes, trailing far behind the Center and Spanish Socialist Workers' Party and losing slightly to the Communists. He abandoned the Alliance in 1978, refusing to endorse the 1978 constitution; at that time Valiente already nurtured no illusions about Juan Carlos as a king ensuring some sort of conservative, possibly Traditionalist continuity. In 1979, he joined Derecha Democr√°tica Espa√±ola, a renewed and failed attempt to build a popular conservative party; it was dissolved a year after Valiente's death in 1982.

The political satire follows the heads of state of Latin America and Spain who are stranded on an island. The three seasons amassed more than 50 million views on YouTube. Plot Scene from the episode \\"Inca Capai\\", from left to right, Hugo Ch√°vez, Evo Morales, Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, Rafael Correa and Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner. Several presidents met at the 74¬∫ Ibero- American Summit, and have a cruise after it. The cruise crashes with an iceberg, and all the presidents arrive at a desert paradise island. The episodes focus on their attempts to survive in the wild or escape from the island. Several presidents who were not included in the first episodes were added later, with a plane crash. Hugo Ch√°vez disappears from the island, kidnapped by Barack Obama for unmentioned reasons. A malfunctioning robot that impersonates Ch√°vez leaves Obama's secret base, until he manages to turn him off. Many presidents died during an attack of \\"Ch√°vez-raptors\\" (savage hybrid dinosaurs with the face of Ch√°vez), and they are finally rescued at the end of the second season. At the beginning of the third season, the presidents are stranded on another island free of dinosaurs. Several presidents were killed off in the second and third season (corresponding to the end of their terms in real life). The show parodies pop culture, such as Jurassic Park and El Chavo del Ocho Production Almost all of the characters were voiced by Emilio Lovera.

Maduro criticized his portrayal in the animation. He said that it was not an accurate representation of his face, his moustache, of his voice.

It was initially offered in the Icon series of bolt-action rifles in 2007, which were released at the same time. While it did accomplish its goal, consumer acceptance was low, and the round has remained on the sidelines. The 6.5mm Creedmoor cartridge was created by necking down the .30 TC, and has achieved widespread popularity. It is the first Thompson Center headstamped cartridge. Overview As it has been understood that gunpowder burns more efficiently in shorter wide-diameter casings, modern ammunition has changed over time to become shorter and wider than previous cartridges. The .30 TC (0.308 in (7.8 mm) x 1.920 in (48.8 mm) is a non-magnum that is somewhat shorter and wider appearing compared to the .308 and .30-06. The .30 TC has a performance delivery equivalent to the .30-06. While in a gun, all three weigh roughly the same but the .30 TC produces less recoil. The case length of the .30 TC is 1.92 inches. Although it is somewhat shorter than the .308, the .30 TC still manages to cast a 150-grain SST bullet downrange that is nearly 200 fps faster. The .30 TC can even outshoot the 150-grain SST faster than the .30-06 case, which is also longer in size compared to the .30 TC (2.494 inches). The cartridge is approximately an inch shorter if one uses Hornady's Superformance ammo. When loaded with the 165-grain SST bullets, the .30 TC has a fifty fps advantage over the .30-06, which has a velocity of 2,850 fps. In sum, the .30 TC delivers energy and speed that equals to, or tops the .30-06 as a smaller cartridge.

Durcon has sales and fabrication facilities in Canada, Poland, Malaysia and China to serve markets in Europe and Russia, the Middle East and Southeast Asia.  Manufacturing  Durcon Epoxy Resin worksurfaces are thermosets cured through three stages. By combining two reactive materials ‚Äì monolithic epoxy resin and the curing agent ‚Äì with a catalyst and heat, the resin and curing agent react to result in the branching of chains. As curing continues, molecular weight accelerates causing viscosity to increase. Eventually, the material changes from a viscous liquid to a solid gel. The material is then placed into a curing oven to increase durability and solidity. The final stage of curing results in completion of the cross-linking process at which the average molecule weight diverges to infinity. Thermosets like epoxy resin possess good dimensional stability, thermal stability and chemical resistance.  Growth  In 2011, Durcon moved all its U.S. operations to Taylor, resulting in an expansion of its facilities and 65 new jobs. \\"We went from learning there was a chance that we could lose 200 jobs to having a net gain of 65 jobs,\\" Jason Ford, CEO of the Taylor Economic Development Corp. said. \\"We are incredibly excited to work with Durcon as it grows here.\\" , Durcon has invested more than $7.5 million in its Taylor facility.

The museum houses a few exhibitions, as well as a large open-air museum, which consists mainly of houses and boats, including the old Gar√∞ar house and the 86-tonne ketch Sigurfari (K√∫tter Sigurfari). The main purpose of the Akranes Folk Museum is to collect, register, preserve, research and display artefacts and other objects of cultural and historical value for the Akranes area and Iceland.Akranes Folk Museum ‚Äì Collection policy (not accessible on the web). The Akranes Folk Museum is located at Gar√∞ar in Akranes, near the town's cemetery. It is easily accessible from Reykjav√≠k via car or bus route 57. History The history of the Akranes Folk Museum dates back to 1959, when the museum was founded. Ten years prior, local pastor J√≥n M. Gu√∞j√≥nsson had started collecting artefacts from the Akranes area. By the time the museum was opened he had already collected between 1500 and 2000 artefacts. Originally located in the old Gar√∞ar house, the museum moved to a new location in 1974. The old Gar√∞ar house is now part of the museum's house collection. Attractions The 86-tonne, two mastered ketch Sigurfari (K√∫tter Sigurfari) is arguably the museum's most notable artefact, located outside the main museum building. Sigurfari was built in England in 1885, out of oak. It was used for fishing in Iceland until 1919 and in the Faroe Islands until the 1970s. Sigurfari is the only preserved ship of its kind in Iceland. Formerly open to the public, Sigurfari is now unsafe to board and is in need of restoration. The Akranes Folk Museum preserves and exhibits examples from the past of everyday life in the Akranes area. The museum's collection includes household items, various tools and machinery used by craftsmen, farmers and fishermen, medical equipment, costumes, part of a turf house, etc. The museum's house collection consists of several 19th and 20th century houses from the Akranes area. Most of the houses have been relocated to the museum area from their original locations. An exception is the old Gar√∞ar house, where the Folk Museum was originally housed. This house was built in 1876 as a parsonage and is the oldest house made of concrete in Iceland. The Gar√∞ar house is open to the public, as well as Ne√∞ri-S√Ωrupartur, Sandar-Vestri and the Folk Museum building. Gar√∞ar depicts a late 19th to early 20th century upper-class Icelandic home. The other houses are Sandar-Vestri, a working class family home built in 1901; Ne√∞ri-S√Ωrupartur, the oldest preserved timber house in Akranes built in 1875; Geirssta√∞ir, a home and preschool built in 1903; Fr√≥√∞√°, a net and sail workshop built in 1938; St√∫kuh√∫si√∞, an IOGT meeting house that was originally built as a barn in 1916. Opening hours The Akranes Folk Museum is open every day between 10:00 and 17:00 during the Summer (May 15th ‚Äì September 15th) and offers a guided tour on weekdays at 14:00 all year round, including the Winter season (September 16th ‚Äì May 14th). It is possible to book guided tours outside opening hours. An insight into the museum's daily events is available on the Akranes Folk Museum Facebook page.

Background Hayden graduated from the college preparatory Sayre School in Lexington, Kentucky. He then studied at Marshall University in Huntington in western West Virginia, where he was the student body president and a member of the West Virginia Board of Trustees. He is employed in the financial services industry. His father is Thomas Lee Hayden (born 1932), formerly a mathematics professor at the University of Kentucky at Lexington, Kentucky, and now of Lewisville, Texas. Hayden's great-grandfather drove cattle on the old trails in Texas and purchased a ranch in 1890 near Moran, Texas, which is still in the Hayden family. Hayden's grandfather was an attorney, district attorney, and the mayor of Abilene, Texas, during the 1930s and 1940s. Hayden is Vice President of Investment Strategy for Liberty Bankers Life. Political life On December 16, 2013, at a regular city council meeting, Mayor Hayden declared 2014 the \\"Year of the Bible\\" in his city. The proclamation is not an order on behalf of the municipal government but action taken specifically by the mayor to encourage constituents to read the Bible. Hayden also promoted a website of the Calvary Chapel Church in Flower Mound. Hayden said the issue should not focus upon him but on Scripture: \\"Everyone's personal relationship with God is a personal decision [and] may differ with mine. If I can, I would like to encourage people to read the Bible.\\" Hayden traced the biblical roots of the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Emancipation Proclamation. He also stressed the moral fiber of the Founding Fathers. The proclamation drew both support and opposition from constituents. Jewish Rabbi Geoffrey Dennis of the Congregation Kol Ami said that more than a year earlier he had advised Hayden not to issue the proclamation: \\"He thinks this is about him and his opportunity to promote his faith in his role as mayor. But I think he needs to realize that I and the other people who voted him to office voted him in as mayor, not as Bishop of Flower Mound.\\" On May 11, 2013, Hayden declared \\"Falun Dafa Day\\", also known as Falun Gong, a self-improvement practice rooted in ancient Chinese culture that emphasizes truth, compassion, forbearance, and meditation. In 2012, Hayden unseated Mayor Melissa Northern, his former political ally. On May 10, 2014, he was reelected to a second two-year term. The position is nonpartisan and part-time. On the first Saturday of every month from 8 to 10 a.m., Mayor Hayden hosts a town meeting in different neighborhoods of his city. Prior to becoming mayor, Hayden had been a member of the town council.

Background Ongoing news reports in the international media have revealed operational details about the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and its international partners' global surveillance of foreign nationals and U.S. citizens. The reports emanate from a cache of top secret documents leaked by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden. In June 2013, the first of Snowden's documents were published simultaneously by The Washington Post and The Guardian, attracting considerable public attention. North America=Hepting v. AT&T; Hepting v. AT&T; is a US class action lawsuit filed in January 2006 by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) against the telecommunications company AT&T;, in which the EFF alleges that AT&T; permitted and assisted the National Security Agency (NSA) in unlawfully monitoring the communications of the United States, including AT&T; customers, businesses and third parties whose communications were routed through AT&T;'s network, as well as voice over IP telephone calls routed via the Internet. The case is separate from, but related to, the NSA warrantless surveillance controversy, in which the federal government agency bypassed the courts to monitor U.S. phone calls without warrants. Hepting v. AT&T; does not include the federal government as a party. Jewel v. NSA Jewel v. National Security Agency is a United States class action lawsuit filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) against the National Security Agency (NSA) and several high-ranking officials of the administration for 43rd U.S. president George W. Bush, charging an \\"illegal and unconstitutional program of dragnet communications surveillance\\". Clapper v. Amnesty International 'Clapper v. Amnesty International, , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that Amnesty International USA and others lacked standing to challenge 50 U. S. C. ¬ß1881a of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act as amended by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008. Klayman v. Obama The plaintiffs, subscribers of Verizon Wireless, brought suit against the NSA,the DOJ, President Obama, Attorney General Holder, General Keith Alexander, and Verizon Communication.https://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/JudgeLeonNSAopinion12162013.pdf The plaintiffs allege that the government is conducting a \\"secret and illegal government scheme to intercept vast quantities of domestic telephonic communications\\". On December 16, 2013, US Federal Judge Richard J. Leon ruled that bulk collection of American telephone metadata likely violates the Constitution of the United States. The judge wrote, \\"I cannot imagine a more 'indiscriminate' and 'arbitrary' invasion than this systematic and high-tech collection and retention of personal data on virtually every single citizen for purposes of querying and analyzing it without prior judicial approval ... Surely, such a program infringes on 'that degree of privacy' that the founders enshrined in the Fourth Amendment.\\" ACLU v. Clapper The American Civil Liberties Union and its affiliates brought suit challenging the legality of the NSA's bulk data collection program. The district court granted a dismissal, and the plaintiffs announced their intention to appeal the decision to the Second Circuit court of Appeals. ACLU v Clapper was heard before the Second Circuit on May 7, 2015. The Second Circuit did not address the constitutionality of the data collection program, but did find that the implementation of the mass surveillance program being authorized by section 215 of the Patriot Act was illegal. The court also found ACLU had alleged a concrete, fairly traceable, and redressable injury sufficient to confer standing to assert their First Amendment rights, based on an infringement of freedom of speech and freedom of association.ACLU v Clapper. Docket 14-42 (2nd Cir. 2015) Paul v. Obama In February 2015, Paul filed suit against the federal government NSA spying program in a suit titled Paul v. Obama. The suit is expected to be a drawn out process, and Paul stressed his intent is not to harm the intelligence capacity or American government in any way, but simply to restore the country to the Constitutional protections that have ensured her stability. The case was stayed pending the appeal of the court's order in a related case, Klayman v. Obama (Civil Action No. 13-cv-851), which was resolved on June 8, 2016. Since there had been no motion to lift the stay or other activity for nearly two years, the Court issued an Order on March 5, 2018, requiring plaintiff to show cause in writing, by April 4, 2018, as to why this case should not be dismissed for want of prosecution. The case was dismissed without prejudice on February 7, 2019 because the plaintiff failed to respond to the Court's Order to Show Cause within the time prescribed by the court.

Life The current scholarly view is that little can be said certainly about his early life: he was related to Henry Cunningham who was Governor of Jamaica, and so linked to the Glencairn family. He was travelling tutor to James Carmichael from 1692 to 1695. Cunningham visited Rome in 1700, after giving up a position as tutor to Lord Lorne. The following year he was sent as agent to Paris, nominally on a mission to prepare a trade convention or commercial treaty, between France and Scotland, but in reality as a spy. He gave William III of England an account of French military preparations. After William's death, he continued to act on behalf of the Whig party. He visited Hanover with Joseph Addison in 1703, where he was received by the Electress Sophia and her son George I Louis. Cunningham was frequently consulted by the framers of the union between England and Scotland. He tried to reconcile Harley and Somers, and was an acquaintance of Sir Isaac Newton. After the Whigs lost power in 1710, he returned to tutoring, in 1711 accompanying Lord Lonsdale to Italy. The accession of George I brought Cunningham in 1715 the appointment as British envoy to Venice, where he remained till 1720, when he retired on a pension. He then returned to London. He died in 1737, and was buried in the church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields on 15 May 1737. By his will, he left a fortune of ¬£12,000. Works A manuscript history in Latin by Cunningham came into the possession of Thomas Hollingbery, archdeacon of Chichester, a relative of his; who gave it to William Thomson. Thomson published an elaborate translation of it, in two volumes, in 1787 as The History of Great Britain from the Revolution in 1688 to the accession of George I. The history has been taken as authoritative for many of the events it relates, but is a partisan Whig account. Thomson argued, wrongly given the extant wills, that the author was the same person as Alexander Cunningham the critic (1655?‚Äì1730). He had some notable supporters for his theory, which did not last into the 19th century.

During the subsequent operation, Tommy is severely injured in a resultant car accident, and Ash is then suspended. Subsequently, approached in a pub by Cartwright (Stewart), the head of top-secret UNIT (Undercover Narcotics Investigation Team), on first entering UNIT's HQ he meets a familiar face, his Customs training officer Valerie (Ashbourne).

Filming began in London in March 2014, with David Gyasi cast in the lead role, but he left the production after injuring his leg. With OT Fagbenie recast in the lead role, filming re-commenced in April 2014. Part of the filming took place in Gravesend, at Nell's Cafe, which doubled for a cafe called 'Planet Thanet'. with the UNIT base scenes filmed on location in Keybridge House, a decommissioned British Telecom building in Vauxhall. The Interceptor was the first BBC production which purposefully used only electric powered cars behind the camera, using a fleet of five leased Vauxhall Ampera's. Background Cameron Addicott is a retired UK customs officer/SOCA agent. Addicott had joined the Alpha Projects Unit, a group of dedicated undercover Customs officers who hunted the UK's most dangerous criminals. Using telephone and electronically tapped data feeds, the Alpha team would then use the resulting intelligence to prevent serious criminals from committing crime, including prevention of murders, stopping large shipments of drugs and other organised crime. After retiring in 2008, Addicott began writing his memoirs, with the first part co-written by Kris Hollington and published by Penguin Books in 2010, titled The Interceptor. Reception The series received a universally negative response from critics. It was given 1/5 stars by Michael Hogan who, writing in The Telegraph, said \\"Fagbenle tried his best to inject some life into the limp script ‚Äì huffing, puffing, pouting and glowering ‚Äì but he‚Äôs too good for this hokum\\". Adam Postans writing for the Daily Mirror who wrote \\"This attempt at a gritty crime drama... is a clich√©d mess with appalling dialogue,\\" and Sally Newell writing for The Independent wrote that the \\"watchable but predictable prime-time cop drama\\" was like \\"EastEnders on an adrenalin rush, but this contrived cop show lacks heart.\\" Broadcast The series premiered in Australia on 12 August 2015 on BBC First.

History Prior to 1812 the Orthodox Church in eastern Moldavia or Bessarabia, modern day Moldova, was part of the Metropolis of Moldavia (under the Church of Constantinople). Following the annexation of Bessarabia by the Russian Empire in 1812, the Russian Orthodox Church established the Eparchy of Chi≈üinƒÉu and Khotin under Metropolitan Gavril (BƒÉnulescu-Bodoni) to care for the region's Orthodox Christians.Via≈£a bisericeascƒÉ din Basarabia sub stƒÉp√¢nirea ruseascƒÉ (1812-1918) The Eparchy of Chi≈üinƒÉu and Khotin remained part of the Russian Orthodox Church until Bessarabia's union with Romania in 1918, after which the Romanian Orthodox Church established jurisdiction over the territory following the expulsion of the then Archbishop of Chi≈üinƒÉu, Anastasius (Gribanovsky), and reorganized the Eparchy as the Metropolis of Chi≈üinƒÉu and Bessarabia. In 1940, following the annexation of Bessarabia by the Soviet Union, the Moscow Patriarchate established in Chi≈üinƒÉu a new Russian Orthodox eparchy, while the Metropolis of Bessarabia was forced to interrupt its activity. Following Moldovan independence from the USSR, the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church granted the Church's eparchies in Moldova autonomy as the Moldovan Orthodox Church, with Archbishop Vladimir (Cantarean) of Chi≈üinƒÉu becoming first hierarch of the Church of Moldova as Metropolitan of Chi≈üinƒÉu and All Moldova.

Self-taught, he became a respected contributor to Le Temps, writing on a broad range of subjects. He was hostile to the poets associated with the Decadent movement and positive about colonial enterprises. He did much to improve agriculture, particularly the cultivation of olives, in Tunisia. Early years Sculpture of Paul Bourde in Voissant Paul Anthelme Bourde was born at Voissant, Is√®re, on 23 May 1851. His father was a deputy sergeant in the Savoy customs. After Savoy was annexed by France in 1860, the family moved to northern France near the Belgian border, where Bourde studied at the local school in Harcy. He moved on to the Petit S√©minaire of Charleville, where he was a classmate of Arthur Rimbaud and the future novelist Jules Mary. He was expelled from the s√©minaire in 1866 for having planned with his friends to escape and travel to Abyssinia to search for the sources of the Nile. Rimbaud took the plan seriously and began to learn the Amharic language. For a while Bourde undertook farm work in the Bugey region, where his parents had retired. He then took a job in Lyon, where he met the poet Josephin Soulary, the curator of the library. Soulary helped him move to Paris, where despite being self-taught he wanted to become a journalist. At first he struggled to make a living. When the Franco-Prussian War (1870‚Äì71) was declared he had to join the National Guard to avoid starvation. Bourde's first publication, under the pseudonym of \\"Paul Delion\\", was a violent attack on the members of the Commune and the Central Committee published by Alphonse Lemerre in 1871. By chance he met the chemist Marcellin Berthelot, who helped him get work at the Parisian newspaper Le Temps. In 1879 Le Temps chose him to accompany a parliamentary mission to Algeria. His account of this trip established his reputation as a journalist and a colonial publicist. In 1880 Bourde reported on the occupation of Tunisia, and then toured Europe. In 1885 he visited B·∫Øc Ninh in Tonkin. Bourde traveled with the expedition of Francis Garnier in Tonkin as a reporter for Le Temps, and published De Paris au Tonkin in 1885. As the expedition passed through Port Said, Bourde sent a report describing it as a sleazy place where European prostitutes waited to fleece colonials who had made their fortunes in the east, rather than as a romantic oriental town. He was unimpressed by the Suez Canal, which he found monotonous despite the impressive statistics. He also asserted that the British preferred to travel by French ships to avoid the \\"barbaric cooking of their compatriots.\\" Many of his articles from these journeys were published in Le Temps. The 6 August 1885 issue of Le Temps carried a Bourde column, in which St√©phane Mallarm√© and Paul Verlaine were labeled \\"decadent\\" poets. He said there was nothing new in their movement, which was simply an exaggerated form of Romanticism. The poet Ernest Raynaud said that Bourde was the first to use the appellation \\"d√©cadent\\", meaning it as a slur, but the term was readily accepted by its targets, who became known as the decadent movement. Colonial administrator Sculpture of Paul Bourde in Sfax In 1890, after another visit to Tunisia, Bourde launched a campaign accusing the French government of neglecting its duties in Tunisia, where the local people were living in misery. He said that French colonists could show them good farming methods and the route to prosperity, progress and happiness. The government responded by appointing him to an administrative position in Tunisia, and made him Director of Agriculture when he arrived in Tunis. He became an effective administrator of both colonization and agriculture. Bourde learned from ancient accounts of the country and showed that fruit trees, particularly olives, could be grown in the semi-arid region south of Kairouan. He argued that central Tunisia had been a desert before the Roman invasion, and the Romans had introduced olive tree cultivation. In the 11th century the Arabs destroyed the trees in an attempt to convert the area to pasturage for a nomadic population, causing great damage. He found that, contrary to the opinions of archaeologists, milled stones found in many ruins were not steles commemorating local deities but were olive presses. Bourde revived agriculture in the neglected areas, by working with associations of European settlers and local people. He was a prolific author of reports on cultivation of cereals and fruit trees, sheep raising, locust invasions, cactus plantations and vineyards. Due to his success in Tunisia, Bourde was appointed Secretary General of Madagascar in 1895. He traveled to Madagascar in January 1896, but soon fell out with that island's Resident General, Hippolyte Laroche, who accused Bourde of trying to usurp his position. He left when the island was converted from a protectorate to a colony in January 1897. Last years Back in France in 1897, Bourde again became a regular contributor to Le Temps, and submitted articles for the remainder of his life. He was among the first to urge French intervention in Morocco, and regularly pushed for the methodical exploration of the Sahara. He continued to write on a range of philosophical and historical subjects, including the French Revolution. Paul Bourde died in Paris on 27 October 1914. A monument to Bourde was created by the Belgian sculptor Yvonne Serruys. It was unveiled in Sfax, Tunisia, by Resident General Fran√ßois Manceron on 13 April 1930 in a ceremony attended by many notable people. Bourde's and that of the geologist Philippe Thomas were thrown down and shattered on the night of 3‚Äì4 January 1957. The mayor of Voissant, Bourde's birthplace, managed to recover it and erect it in the heart of Voissant, where it stood until 1981. It was then replaced by a copy. The village of N√©yrieu near Saint-Beno√Æt, Ain, where Paul Bourde is buried, asked for the original. A local stonemason restored the bust, and it was put in place in the village in 1994.

Bell is an American novelist, artist, producer, and enterprise software architect, chiefly recognized for developing the Incremental Software Architecture methodology, Service-oriented modeling framework (SOMF), and the cloud computing modeling notation (CCMN). His innovative research and publications in the fields of software architecture, service-oriented architecture, Microservices, model-driven engineering, cloud computing, and big data are recognized internationally for their contribution to the software design and development communities.  Biography  Bell earned his computer science master‚Äôs degree in 1992 from the City University of New York (CUNY). After graduation, as a software developer and enterprise architect consultant, he dedicated his career to improving business and technological operations of financial institutions in Wall Street. He developed innovative software algorithms and methodologies for high-volume Electronic trading platforms. This included modules for execution of trading applications, persistence methods for large volumes of data, and design of high-speed network and internet software implementations. He has worked for J.P. Morgan Chase, Citibank, UBS-Paine Webber, Deutsche Bank, American Express, TD Waterhouse, Pfizer, AIG, Prudential. and United States Department of Veterans Affairs.  Bell‚Äôs Service-Oriented Modeling Methodology  Service-Oriented Modeling Framework (SOMF) Version 2.0 In 2008 Bell introduced the Service-oriented modeling framework (SOMF) to the software development community in his book Service-Oriented Modeling. The service framework, driven by Discipline- specific modeling, was devised to encourage consolidation of software assets, reduction of systems redundancy, and acceleration of time-to-market. SOMF includes a modeling language and a life cycle methodology (see image on the far right) suited for narrowing the gap between the business and the information technology organizations in the enterprise. The framework also includes modeling disciplines and practices of software systems, for the purpose of designing software applications. Furthermore, SOMF offers a variety of architectural styles, such as enterprise architecture, application architecture, service-oriented architecture, and cloud computing.  Bell's Incremental Software Architecture Methodology  Incremental Software Architecture Process Traditionally, to promote the establishment and growth of an enterprise end-state architecture, architects, typically senior IT professionals, deliver a diagram that depicts a future production landscape. In most cases, these software designers claim that such as a ‚Äúto be‚Äù architecture is unbreakable and could sustain rapid market trends and complex technological evolution. Their claim also seems to assure that the illustrated architecture would operate flawlessly in production. Would it? In many cases, though, such laid on paper architecture, is merely an academic proposition, which later fails to deliver system stability, business continuity, and superb performance. In other words, this speculative architecture tends to break down because of design flaws, and most important‚Äîlack of organizational architecture strategy. To tackle the deployment of failing applications and systems to production and reduce the risk of harming the operating environment, the Incremental Software Architecture approach calls for submitting bulletproof architecture blueprints. This enterprise design should also be certified by a wide rainbow of organizational stakeholders to dodge financial calamity and business discontinuity. How is it possible then to ensure that the illustrated design on paper would indeed render a stable production landscape? The term \\"stable\\" means that the deployed systems would meet business and non-functional requirements. The promise of the Incremental Software Architecture, therefore, is rooted in the chief principle, ‚ÄúFirst Design then Develop.‚Äù But this alone is short of avoiding financial burden caused by failing implementations. Equally important, another related tenet calls for modifying the charter of development organizations: The software construction phase as we know it now, should focus on proving that architecture assumptions would certainly work in production. Bottomline, \\"software construction must follow the pace of design evolution.\\" Obviously, not the other way around. The term \\"design evolution\\" means that architects should drive the product development life cycle, during which the end-state architecture could be incrementally modified, while software construction follows design alterations until architecture maturity is achieved. To prove that an end-state architecture would indeed operate flawlessly in production, the grand enterprise design should be decomposed into sub-architectures. Such end-state architecture decomposition, therefore, would allow designers to drill down into their detail architecture and enable developers to focus on constructing architecture segments‚Äîone at a time, or some in parallel. But proving that each individual end-state architecture segment works as designed, does not mean that the entire enterprise architecture as a whole would indeed perform flawlessly. To verify if an end-state architecture is stable and could endure production environment pressures, an overall architecture stress testing should be considered to assure its stability and fitness. Consider the Incremental Software Architecture process, as depicted in the provided image: 1\\\\. End-State Architecture Discovery and Analysis. Ascertaining systems and related applications in an end-state architecture proposition 2\\\\. End-State Architecture Decomposition. The decomposition process is driven by segmenting the enterprise grand design into structural, behavioral, and volatile regions, so developers can prove that these sub-architectures would indeed work in production 3\\\\. End-State Architecture Verification. Authentication tasks include design substantiation (software construction,) end-state architecture stress testing, and enterprise capacity planning.

It included the works of Berlin-based artists Jonathan Monk, Uwe Henneken, Sa√¢dane Afif, and Haralampi G. Oroschakoff. In 2010, Art Below joined with Peace Strike to create a series of plinth art installations promoting peace in Parliament Square by the Palace of Westminster in London. The first installation, in February 2011, was by special effects artist Tristan \\"Schoony\\" Schoonraad, who created a 3D installation depicting child soldiers.\\"'Boy soldiers' artwork shown outside Parliament,\\" BBC News, 19 February 2011.

A 2010 Art Below exhibit included an installation of Banksy's work at London Bridge station which was then visited and \\"modified\\" by a graffiti artist, possibly Banksy himself. The work Forgive Us Our Trespassing by Banksy was reworked and issued without the halo dripping with paint over the boy's head, to promote his film Exit Through the Gift Shop. The public transport company Transport for London (TfL) had forbidden the inclusion of the halo on the poster, fearing it would give the impression of graffiti in the underground. A few days after the work was up, the halo was repainted, prompting the TfL to remove the posters. In 2011, Art Below teamed up with the Saatchi Gallery to showcase the work of the 20 finalists of the 2011 New Sensations prize, on all the billboard space on an entire platform at the Regent's Park tube station leading up to that year's Frieze Art Fair.

Work Rahmani has performed and exhibited work at numerous venues, including the Hudson River Museum, Exit Art, and the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center (Ecovention, exhibition) in Ohio. One of Rahmani's best known works is Ghost Nets 1990-2000 (Tallmer, Kagan, Carruthers, Genocchio), which includes her original theories of environmental restoration and trigger point theory. In 2012, she applied trigger point theory and the \\"Gulf to Gulf\\" webcasts to \\"Fish Story Memphis,\\" a multi-part public art project designed for ‚ÄúMemphis Social,‚Äù curated by Tom McGlynn (2013) (Memphis is the Center of the World). In 2006, Rahmani initiated a series of podcasts, \\"Virtual Cities and Oceans of If\\", which segued into webcasts on climate change. She is currently an Affiliate with the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado Boulder, Colorado (UCB), where she has been collaborating with the Director, James White since 2007 on, \\"Gulf to Gulf,\\" a series of webcasts on global warming with other scientists, artists and thinkers.(Boettger,NY Times, Lippard, Weather Report) Their first collaborative work premiered with Cultura21 in the Joseph Beuys Pavilion of the 2007 Venice Biennale. In 2007, Rahmani in collaboration with White appeared in the collective exhibition Weather Report, debuting her titled work ‚ÄúTrigger Points, Tipping Points.‚Äù Rahmani displayed a series of digital prints that superimposed satellite imagery with textual warnings on the morphing and changing of climate change on the global landscape. Her work embodies a discourse that focuses on the power dynamics of disaster and how rising sea levels will not only effect landscape, but also result in the relocation of communities and refugee migration. Rahmani seamlessly ties together climate change with the themes of class, power, and justice ‚Äî a conversation not as prevalent in the global warming conversation. In 2009, Rahmani served as a formal observer for University of Colorado Boulder at the COP15 and blogged about her experience for High Tide, an arts collective based in Liverpool, UK. Rahmani's current work reflects her interest in the application of mapping analysis, to \\"explore potential solutions for urban and rural water degradation in large landscapes.\\" Rahmani's recent work also uses the internet \\"to perform residencies without the international travel that spews jet fuel over the earth's waters.\\" Virtual Cities and Oceans of If and the ongoing Virtual Concerts address global warming and geo-political conflicts by demonstrating, analyzing and interpreting the local impact of global warming at international real world sites.

Early life Christopher Neville Hutchins is the younger of two sons and one daughter of Edward Victor Hutchins (d. 1944) and Kathleen Violet Ness (d 1995).Mr Confidential ‚Äì Chris Hutchins (Blake, 2005) He was educated at Torquay Boys' Grammar School. In 1956, he began a fan club for ventriloquist Terry Hall and Lenny the Lion. Hutchins lost interest when he discovered Elvis Presley and girls. Hutchins then landed a job as a journalist on the Mid Devon Times on a salary of ¬£2-a-week. In 1961, Hutchins joined the NME (New Musical Express) but left the paper the following year to travel to Hamburg with Little Richard whose autobiography he was ghosting. In the German city, he met and befriended The Beatles ‚Äì who called him \\"Crispy Hutch\\" ‚Äì and when he rejoined the NME in 1962 he was assigned to travel with them on all their tours. Having befriended Elvis Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, and then Presley himself, it was Hutchins who set up a party in Presley's Los Angeles home for the Beatles to meet Presley on Friday 27 August 1965.Elvis: His Life From A-Z ‚Äì Fred L. Worth & Steve D. Tamerius (Contemporary Books, 1988) Public relations In 1966, Hutchins left the NME where he was news editor to form his own PR company.

It was Hutchins who persuaded Jones's manager Gordon Mills to change the singer's image. Under Hutchins's tutelage, Jones's marriage was played down, his sexuality played up and his availability to the press limited.Tom Jones: The Biography ‚Äì Robin Eggar (Headline, 2000) Since Mills also managed Engelbert Humperdinck and Gilbert O'Sullivan, Hutchins became their PR as well. Other clients included the Bee Gees, Status Quo, the Moody Blues, Procol Harum and Eric Clapton. For a while he also worked for Harold Wilson who became his friend. Indeed, it was Hutchins's friendship with the prime minister that saved a difficult situation. In April 1974, Tom Jones was kept a virtual prisoner in his suite at the Caracas Hilton in Venezuela during an ill-judged tour and a cable from Hutchins to Wilson helped to ease the wheels of the party's freedom plus a bribe of $12,000. Journalism In 1976, after ten years with Management Agency & Music (MAM) or The Family as Mills's stable of artists was known, Hutchins closed his PR company to return to journalism. On 16 April 1977,The Family Daily Mirror, 16.4.77 the first of a series of ten articles about The Family was published in the Daily Mirror. On 19 April, Gordon Mills's lawyer, Michael Balin, tried to take out an injunction to prevent the stories but the Mirror took the case to the High Court where three judges, including Master of the Rolls Lord Denning, found in the newspaper's favour. Gordon Mills flew into Heathrow from Los Angeles threatening to punch Hutchins. The series added 180,000 to the Mirror circulation. In May 1981, Hutchins began the gossip column, Chris Hutchins Confidential in the Sunday Mirror. The column subsequently moved to the Daily Express in 1986 and the following year to Today when Rupert Murdoch bought the newspaper. In 1997, Confidential returned to the Sunday Mirror after then editor Bridget Rowe saw Hutchins pontificating on a subject on Sky News. The column was lastly revived in Punch, under the editorship of James Steen ‚Äì who had been one of Hutchins's foot soldiers on Today ‚Äì after Garth Gibbs, the former gossip columnist for the Daily Mirror left the magazine. Biographies After breaking the story of the Duchess of York's affair with the Texan oil billionaire Oscar Wyatt's son Steve, Hutchins wrote his first book Fergie Confidential. That was followed by Diana on the Edge, Elvis Meets the Beatles, Athina the Last Onassis, Goldsmith: Money, Women & Power and his autobiography Mr Confidential. Mark Bolland, the former deputy private secretary to The Prince of Wales, reviewed the book for British Journalism Review and wrote:http://www.bjr.org.uk/data/2005/no4_whittle > \\"Chris Hutchins seems to have seen and done it all.

And he helped Richard > Branson take on British Airways.\\"Branson ‚Äì Tom Bower (4th Estate, 2000) Hutchins was criticised by many in showbusiness for breaking confidences. Frank Sinatra was once quoted as saying, \\"Your secrets are safe with this guy Hutchins, it's the people he tells who are indiscreet.\\" More recently he turned his attention to Russians Roman Abramovich and Vladimir Putin producing Abramovich: The Billionaire from Nowhere (with Dominic Midgley) and Putin A Biography. He returned to the British royal family in 2013 with Harry The People‚Äôs Prince.

This educational event merges art, ecology, environmentalism and environmental justice, to inform the public about uranium mining and milling, nuclear power issues, nuclear weapons and the nuclear fuel cycle from \\"cradle to grave\\" life-cycle assessment - and the effects of radioactivity on humans and other species. The festival founders and principal organizers are Norbert Suchanek and Marcia Gomes de Oliveira. The legal organizer of the International Uranium Film Festival is the arts and education non-profit \\"Yellow Archives\\". The organizers and the festival participants seek to educate and activate the international public on these issues through the dynamic media of film and video. Film themes Photo of Ed Grothus' The Black Hole surplus company by Jeff Keyzer, 2009 The films shown typically have content that critiques and analyzes uranium mining, milling, and use, and the effects there of on land, water and human health. A key objective of the festival is to inform cultures and future generations about the effects of radioactivity and radioactive materials. Public education and open discussion of these matters may lead to a more peaceful, healthy future, and hold promise to promote a safe, sustainable future without nuclear risks.Uranium mining and the Navajo people The Atomic Age nuclear world has produced millions of metric tons of high-level, low-level and intermediate- level radioactive waste during the past sixty years. This waste will remain hazardous for over 100,000 years. Other themes explore atomic legacy issues, including the research, development, testing and use of nuclear weapons. Many of these events affected specific populations including the Marshall Islanders, Native American cultures in the U.S. Southwest and Northwest, First Nations in Western Canada, among others.

Gordeyev then took 29 students hostage, killed one police officer, and injured another. Later on, he surrendered to the authorities. It is the first reported school shooting in Russia's history (the 2004 Beslan school siege is considered a terrorist attack). Shooting At around 11:40 am, Gordeyev, concealing his weapons with a bag and fur coat, went to his school armed with a small-caliber rifle and shotgun that belonged to his father, a police colonel. He threatened the security guard and went to his geography classroom, where he shot his teacher, 29-year-old Andrey Kirillov (), in the stomach, then fatally shot him in the head upon seeing he was still alive. After killing Kirillov, he then took the class of 29 students hostage. Gordeyev then shot at responding police officers in the school, wounding Warrant Officer Sergei Bushuyev, 38, and Senior Sergeant Vladimir Krokhin, 29; Bushuyev later died at the scene, while Krokhin survived a gunshot wound to the shoulder. About an hour after the shooting first started, the Special Forces responded to the scene. Gordeyev initially called his mother before the Special Forces called in his father to negotiate with him. He initially spoke with Gordeyev on the phone for fifteen minutes before being brought into the school with a bulletproof vest to personally talk to him; thirty minutes afterward, Gordeyev released the hostages. At around 1:00 pm, Gordeyev surrendered to authorities and was captured. A Russian report stated that a total of eleven shots were fired by Gordeyev during the shooting. Victims Two people were killed in the shooting, while a third was wounded. The victims were: *Andrey Kirillov, 29 (teacher, killed) *Warrant Officer Sergey Bushuyev, 38 (policeman, killed) *Senior Sergeant Vladimir Krokhin, 29 (policeman, wounded) Reaction Russian President Vladimir Putin called this incident a tragedy and asked to give one's attention to children's education and gun control. He also told a Moscow Kremlin advisory council on the arts and culture that \\"the new generation...needs to be raised with good artistic taste and the ability to understand and value the theatrical, dramatic and musical arts.\\" Criticism was also aimed at violent video games and exposure to American culture. Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin later stated that schools in Moscow have been set to be reviewed for security. Perpetrator 15-year-old Sergey Gordeyev (born October 4, 1998) was identified as the perpetrator of the shooting. He attended School No. 263, had a very good reputation, and was due to an excellent record being described as a \\"model student\\" who sets up \\"an example for the whole school\\". Concerning a motive of shooting, first, there arose two versions. According to the most sound (but later rejected) one, Gordeyev opened fire from revenge against the geography teacher who was trying to interfere with his planned graduation with honors ‚Äì and Kirillov was fixed upon as the teacher Gordeyev had conflicts with. Another version suggested that Gordeyev was suffering from an emotional disorder, and had no previous apparent conflicts with either teachers or fellow pupils although some described him as \\"strange\\". A medical examination confirmed that Gordeyev has symptoms of mental disorder (paranoid schizophrenia). The court sentenced him to involuntary treatment in a psychiatric hospital. Later, the court also obliged the parents of Gordeyev to pay a certain sum of money in support of the son of the killed teacher.

History  A formal Curriculum in Social Work was first offered by the University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, in 1921. In 1936, the first Master of Social Work (MSW) degree was offered by the Institute of Public and Social Administration (later to become the Institute of Social Work in 1946). From 1936 to 1951, a total of 348 MSW degrees were granted. In 1951, the School of Social Work was established to offer a professional educational program on the graduate level leading to advanced degrees, and the program moved from Detroit to Ann Arbor, with Fedele F. Fauri acting as Dean until 1970. The School was first located in a small house on Washington and Thayer, before moving into the Frieze Building where it remained until 1998 when the school moved to a new dedicated building on the corner of South and East University. During the School of Social Work's first year, 91 full-time and 96 part-time students were enrolled. Today the School averages around 650 enrolled MSW students and 80 enrolled doctoral students. In 1957, the Joint Doctoral Program in Social Work and Social Science was created. In the past 15 years, the School has ranked either the #1 or #2 school of social work by U.S. News & World Report and ranked in the top three schools of social work for the past 30 years.

It is the University of Michigan's settlement house, providing space for praxis among community scholars, community activists and residents. Since it was established in mid-2012, the Boulevard House has been used to create a place- based space to develop projects, engage community and support social change. History of the Settlement House Movement The Boulevard House reflects the traditions and approach of the settlement house model in U.S. social work. Inspired by England's Toynbee Hall, the approach was adopted in the United States in the late 1880s and 1890s with such organizations as Stanton Coit's Neighborhood Guild (New York's Lower East Side), Lilian Wald's Henry Street Settlement (Manhattan) and Jane Addams' Hull House (Chicago). The term \\"settlement house\\" mirrored a belief that community outreach should be done from within a community, and the houses provided a residential and community space for those working on local social issues. Original settlement houses often taught adult education and English language classes, provided schooling for immigrants' children, organized job clubs, offered after-school recreation, initiated public health services, and advocated for improved housing for the poor and working classes. In most modern iterations, settlement houses evolved into community centers and no longer provide residential housing for its workers. United Neighborhood Centers for America is the current settlement house membership organization and estimates there are 150 active settlement houses in the U.S.  Purpose  Front view, looking east from W Grand Blvd.The Boulevard House works for the needs and benefits of the neighborhood and larger community, using the models of community-based participatory research and empowerment evaluation. Using these models, the Boulevard House is a space for observation and discussion, creating opportunities for community engagement, action and change initiatives. It is based in community-embedded praxis, which identifies five aspects of social change needed to produce positive and sustainable effects on the social, political and economic systems. Those aspects include comprehensiveness, synchrony, integration, long-term perspective, and inclusiveness. In addition to the above, the Boulevard House adheres to certain practice principles and integrates ongoing community feedback and discovery. The principles of practice are as follows: * Recognize community as a unity of identity * Build on strengths and resources within the community * Facilitate collaborative, equitable involvement of all partners in all phases of the research and practice * Integrate knowledge and intervention for mutual benefit of all partners * Promote a co-learned and empowering process that attends to social inequalities * Involve a cyclical and iterative process * Disseminate findings and knowledge gained to all partners * Involve long-term commitment by all partners  Call to Action  Between 2008 and 2011, the economic downfall of Detroit affected community service programs. Detroit is increasingly recognized among critical social policy theorists as one of the first industrialized, Western democracy cities dramatically emerging from a post‚Äêindustrial to \\"neostructural\\" society. In Detroit, new forms of governance are emerging through a local experience of painful abrogation of democratically elected municipal leadership. Population declines resulted in fewer federal and state resources supporting the traditional range of community services; for example, Detroit's Department of Public Health and City of Detroit Human Services closed, with services eliminated or outsourced to the private sector. Only a few programs survive and thrive through mergers, and many more community programs dramatically reduced services, merged or are in the process of closing. In response, a group of residents, university faculty and social workers began looking at other Detroit neighborhoods which were successfully working to maintain quality of life. As a result, the collaboration applied their knowledge of the settlement house ideal and potential for community work, creating a settlement house reflective of the 21st century. This creative opportunity fit well with the engagement interests of CBI Scholars. The Community-Based Initiative (CBI) is a fellowship program at the University of Michigan's School of Social Work, begun in 1999. It works to create and sustain community and social change in urban cities, neighborhoods and communities, with a specific focus on Detroit. The Boulevard House was launched in summer of 2012 with a vision of providing project-based learning and engagement with the surrounding community. Invited to settle in the vacant property owned by People's Community Services, the project was funded by the UM School of Social Work. The concept developed with a project team at University of Michigan (UM) and a core community committee. The initial stakeholders included: Larry Gant (UM-Social Work and Art & Design), Maria Cotera (UM-Latina/o Studies), Tom Cervenak (People‚Äôs Community Services), Mike Garcia (UAW), Mary Luevanos (CLAVE), Lisa Luevanos (CLAVE), Diana Rivera (Michigan State University) and Gloria Rocha (Comite Patriotico Mexicano). Boulevard House is a call to action to the community, CBI scholars, and all community allies to engage in creative, positive, self-determined change from the ground, up.  Programs =2012-2014 From El Museo del Norte's exhibit, Las Rebeldes One of the strong initial project partners, El Museo del Norte, opened the exhibit, We Will Be Heard!, at the Boulevard House in 2013. This was followed in 2014 by the current exhibit, Las Rebeldes. Preparation for these exhibits involved partners at the University of Michigan and in the community, and they collaboratively completed a lion's share of renovation work inside the house. El Museo has been a primary presence and mobilization force at the Boulevard House for the first year, and drew support from Maria Cotera, Elena Herrada (Fronteras Norte√±as), Jennifer Peacock (UM- Program in American Culture) and Mick Kennedy (UM-School of Architecture). The Stamps School of Art & Design (SSA&D;) also initiated an art exhibit in spring of 2014, Una Vida Linda by Rolando Palacio, which required additional, continued UM and community partner support in preparing the space. Over the summer of 2014, Nick Tobier (Stamps) and Larry Gant (SSW/SSA&D;) used funding through MCubed to host a Detroit-native artist-in-residence, Alana Hoey. In 2014, University of Michigan held several Detroit-based courses at the Boulevard House, including locating the SSW Community-Based Initiative program classwork on site. SSA&D; and the School of Music, Theater and Dance (SMTD) also held classes on site. Current After some assessment and evaluation throughout Fall 2014, the direction of the Boulevard House emerged as one which explores a major social theme specific to Southwest Detroit: the theme of contested proverbial and literal ground in a highly heterogeneous community with a number of waves of immigration, strong enclave identities, and immense development pressures associated with large-scale projects, such as highway construction and land use for a new transborder bridge. As part of its praxis, the Boulevard House chose to engage this theme through a number of theoretical and practice models in order to engage different individuals in relevant ways. A great emphasis has been placed on art as a tool of expression, because it allows participants to express the deepest and most fundamental elements of human experience. Boulevard House's programming has been carefully crafted to occupy a niche not currently filled and which appears to be relevant within the community. Current 2015 events include a weekly open discussion group which focuses on Detroit social issues and politics, Kaffe Politik; a quarterly event which features a themed exhibit, music and a panel, Salon Saturday; a monthly event which features a critical film on social policy, Social Cinema; ad hoc scheduling for planning Hubbard Farms events, neighborhood watch meetings, or other community-driven organizing and education; and weekly University of Michigan Social Work classes for the CBI program.  Critical Exploration of Project Challenges The Boulevard House has experienced a number of challenges that continue to be integrated and addressed. For the first two years, the Museo del Norte project was the strongest presence in the space. El Museo featured exhibits with publicized openings and received strong community support; however, lack of consistent access to the exhibits and infrequent events compromised the space as a destination or community presence. Because el Museo was Boulevard's House primary user, it was unclear that the Boulevard House had its own mission and goals which were distinct from any one project under its roof. However, the Boulevard House's larger mission and goals remained largely in planning stages, due to lack of staff and funding. In Fall 2014, elements finally combined to allow a more directed presence and programming. A project plan was created which prioritized completing initial remodeling work inside the space to optimize areas for galleries; office space to support community scholars in their applied research; and overnight residential space for graduate students, faculty, activists, and allies who were engaged in Detroit. This first project stage was impacted by tensions around ownership and control of the space among partners and the landlord. As this was being resolved, the renovation stage was terminated entirely, following the landlord's notice that the building was being put on the market. With UM's long-term occupancy now in question, the program team regrouped and moved forward immediately with implementing the second stage of the project plan - creating programming within the space. The new circumstances raised interesting questions about how to create place-based space when the \\"place\\" was uncertain. While creating logistical ambiguities which must be managed, the situation mirrored critical questions about changes taking place within Detroit: What does it mean to occupy space which is tenuous as an indirect result of economic politics? Who has claim to the city and how is that expressed through land policies? In looking at occupancy, what does it mean to be authentic and legitimate, and whose voices govern the determination? If Boulevard House must relocate, does it relocate to another Southwest location or elsewhere in the city - and what questions does that raise about the service constituency of Boulevard House or effective strategies around being a transformative partner? Applied scholars affiliated with the Boulevard House actively engage with these questions and others as they move forward with programming and project development.  Applied Theories, Frameworks and Models  Settlement houses are an approach to social work defined by praxis: praxis can be thought of as applied scholarship, where theories and frameworks are integrated into action. In turn, the action informs and refines the theories and approaches. Paulo Freire defines praxis in Pedagogy of the Oppressed as \\"reflection and action directed at the structures to be transformed.\\" Through praxis, people can acquire a critical awareness of their own condition and, with their allies, work for social transformation. The Boulevard House embodies all general settlement house principles and is intended to provide a praxis space for theories, models, frameworks and approaches within community organizing. The underlying theory to be applied depends largely on the project and practitioner or engaged group. Several examples are discussed below.  Empowerment Theory  Empowerment theory asserts that goals are achieved by building on individual and community strengths and resources. Practitioners and activists identify personal and political barriers that maintain oppression and discrimination; increase personal and community power through education, advocacy and direct action; and acknowledge that power is contextual when applying tactics. A settlement house supports this approach by providing space, support and programs aimed at these goals; in particular, the Boulevard House applies this model by providing free space and technical support to any community group which is organizing a project.  Ecological Theory  Ecological theory is a systems theory which states that environmental systems impact individuals and individuals also have the power to impact their environments. The theory identifies and analyzes five dynamic environmental systems: * Micro system: Roles and relationships that a person has in their immediate environment * Mezzo system: Interactions among two or more micro system environments. * Exosystem: All of the external social settings that affect an individual's micro system * Macrosystem: Cultural and social factors * Chronosystem: Patterns of change over time A settlement house provides systems consciousness-raising opportunities and provides space, support and programs through which interventions can be created and implemented, thus changing system dynamics for positive effect within the community. The Boulevard House exemplifies this theory through the Kaffe Politik event, during which community members are encouraged to think critically and systemically about local politics and social policy.  Strengths Perspective  Similar to empowerment theory, the strengths perspective recognizes the assets, capacities, talents, skills, resiliency, hopes and self-determination that individuals and communities possess and embody. Through this perspective, settlement houses create activities and programs which support individuals and families, while communities are encouraged to develop interventions and participate in a group process. The Boulevard House applies this model by providing technical support to any self-organizing community group to help clarify their assets and assist in network building which addresses remaining opportunities.  Feminist Theory  Feminist theory critically examines \\"sexism, sexist exploitation and oppression,\\" according to bell hooks. Feminist theory advocates engaging in dialogue around gender, race, class, ethnicity, sexuality, nationality, age and religion, bringing women's experience to the forefront of pedagogy and thought. One of the basic tenets in feminist activism is making the personal political. By creating a residential space through which practitioners can immerse in the community and engage for a sustained duration, settlement houses embody the overlay of personal, political and meaningful work spaces, contributing significantly to practitioners' own consciousness development. Additionally, programming at settlement houses provide space, support and programs aimed at feminist consciousness raising goals. More, by including residential space at Boulevard House and \\"opening the home\\" to the community for all activities, this approach is embodied.  Women-Centered Model  The women-centered model shares a root idea with Feminist theory in understanding that the personal is political. In case studies cited by Smock, the women-centered model focuses on programs which first strengthen women's self-sufficiency in their personal lives so that they can build skills and confidence which is then applied in the larger community. Settlement houses often model the women-centered model through the many women activists who are working through the center, and therefore provide excellent networking and mentoring opportunities for all women in the community. The Boulevard House offers periodic skills building workshops which would reflect this approach.  Civic Model  The civic model identifies activists within the community as those who are \\"natural\\" leaders, and who begin to participate in the community through their own initiative, often applying skills which they've acquired in the workforce or other activities. In some ways, this is an extension of a strengths perspective, since it leverages existing abilities and resources within the community for tasks and goals. It is often a utilitarian approach, focusing more on specific concerns and reform than sweeping change. It is often seen at the level of neighborhood associations which seek to restore neighborhood stability by inviting neighbors to meet, interact, and problem solve in informal settings. The Boulevard House is situated in a neighborhood which uses the civic model for its organization, providing space for work and planning groups, as requested.  Community Building Model  The community building model focuses on mobilizing community members through collectives, organizations and agencies. Rather than focusing on individuals, per se, this approach focuses on combined power and influence through more formal structure and governance. This approach holds that collective organizations have greater ability to counter and negotiate with government or powerful private interests. Although the Boulevard House chooses to minimize this approach in favor of grass-roots organizing, its association with the University of Michigan and ability to leverage certain resources which are external to any one community places it within this model.  Transformative Model  The transformative model, as defined by Smock, is concerned with formation of extra-local networks, based on shared ideology and concerns. The model, by this definition, seeks to help local activists connect direct experience with large social systems by emphasizing critical thinking and education in theory. The settlement house model provides a literal space for these connections to take place, as well as a place where social issues and their themes can be deconstructed in a group forum. The emphasis in this approach is ultimately to challenge and change structural causes. Pyles uses \\"transformative\\" in a different way, citing the philosophies of practitioners like Paulo Freire. Freire asserts that community members have \\"ownership of the social meaning that will form the basis for social change\\" and \\"a single isolated individual is never conscientized alone, but as part of a community whereby solidarity is developed in relation to a common situation.\\" The focus is on process rather than ends, and it is both revolutionary and ideological in nature. As a community space wherein groups come together to learn, plan, organize and act as agents in the community, settlement houses exemplify this understanding of transformative work. The Boulevard House, in particular, has staff working on a Resident Community Activist concept for Fall 2015; this would draw from the transformative models cited by both Smock and Pyles by selecting an organic activist within the community and providing residential support with academic training in theory in order to deepen his/her local practice.  Marxism  Marxism is relevant to community organizing because it critiques structural barriers within society which ensure hierarchical status quo. In particular, Marxism is concerned with who owns the creative process, whether that process is manufacturing or ensuring safe neighborhoods. While often thought of as a political economic theory, it has clear applications to all sociopolitical concerns. All programming at the Boulevard House is direct and participatory, ensuring that community members own both the process and the product of their collaboration and efforts.  Anarchy  Anarchy, contrary to popular characterizations as chaotic and violent, is a participatory democracy framework in which order is derived from reciprocal aid and resources. While not opposed to State organization, anarchy holds that this must never be coercive or oppressive, and all authority is accountable to those whom it serves. As a de facto community center, the settlement house model and the Boulevard House, in particular, exemplify the anarchist ideal of participatory democracy which focuses on voluntary alliances within the community for social care. In particular, any organizing in which practitioners are involved must provide adequate notice for optimal inclusion of the community and provide clear updates and status reports to the public, for transparency and accountability.
