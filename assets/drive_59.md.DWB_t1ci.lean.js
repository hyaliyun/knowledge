In addition to acting in all three mediums, Vail also saw success as director on the Broadway stage, as well also being a producer of radio programs. Life and career Born on June 29, 1899 in Denver, Colorado, Vail rose to prominence on the New York stage during the mid-1920s in the drama, Caught. Over the next ten years he appeared in over fifteen plays on the Great White Way; his more notable plays being Behold the Bridegroom, which ran in 1927 and 1928, written and directed by George Kelly, and 1934's Are You Decent?. Vail and Ralph Forbes' characters await death in Beau Ideal (1931) In 1931 he took a brief hiatus from the stage, focusing on performing in films. In the year he spent in Hollywood, Vail made eight films, with starring or featured roles in all but one of them. His film debut came in Beau Ideal, the 1931 sequel to the 1926 silent film, Beau Geste, starring alongside Frank McCormack and Ralph Forbes. Other notable films include starring roles in Dance, Fools, Dance (1931), with Joan Crawford; Victor Schertzinger's The Woman Between, which co-starred Lili Damita; and 1932's Big Town, directed by Arthur Hoerl. Other films in which he had a featured role included Consolation Marriage (1931), starring Irene Dunne and Pat O'Brien; and I Take This Woman, starring Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard. After his short stint in films, Vail returned to the stage in 1932. He took another break from the stage in 1935, not returning until the war years of 1941-45, at which point he changed hats, directing, rather than acting. His biggest Broadway success as a director, was his last play, 1945's Chicken Every Sunday, by Julius and Philip Epstein. Beginning in the mid-1930s he entered a new medium: radio. From the 30s through the start of the 1950s, he acted and produced in that arena. He produced several shows for NBC, including Cyrano de Bergerac as part of the Great Plays series. Other shows he would produce for the Great Plays series included Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines, William Tell, and Elizabeth the Queen. Vail would also be one of the directors of the radio serial, The Aldrich Family, which ran from 1939-53. Late in his career, Vail made several appearances on episodic television, including performances on Perry Mason, Father Knows Best and The Donna Reed Show. Vail died on November 28, 1959 in Los Angeles, California.

The novel was first published by Liberty Publishing House in November 2008\\"Nontraditional love\\", Liberty Publishing and nominated for the 2009 Rossica Translation Prize. Nontraditional Love combines satire with Orwellian themes for a unique look at morals and society. Plot The scene is the twenty-third century. USA. Nontraditional Love describes a homosexual world in which mixed-sex marriages are forbidden. The homosexual society is intolerant of dissidents. Intimacy between the sexes is rejected. World history and the classics of world literature, such as Tolstoy, Shakespeare, Dumas... have been falsified in order to support the ideology of this opposite world. At the heart of the novel is a love story between a man and a woman who are forced to hide their feelings and pass as homosexuals. After Robert Marcus' secret wife Liza abandoned him for another man, he decides to make a radical change in life and become a normal gay man. His first male partner should have been Jacob Stein, a retired policeman, but during their first date Jacob dies. Is it a murder or an accident? The FBI begins an investigation and accuses Robert of killing Jacob. The situation becomes complicated because Jacob Stein in his youth made the fateful mistake by having sex with a woman and Liza is Jacob's daughter... In the second book, I Was a Man in a Past Life, the main characters' adventures continue. We learn that Liza Conde is descended from the Princes of Conde, a branch of the Bourbon dynasty, which died out in the nineteenth century. Hypothetically, she has a claim to the French throne, which accounts for the murders of some of her close relatives, committed by a descendant of Napoleon Bonaparte who has dreams of resurrecting the empire. Publication history The novel was first published in New York by Liberty Publishing House in 2008. The book was translated from Russian by Geoffrey Carlson. In Russia, the novel was first published in Moscow in 2020 under the title \\"–ó–∞–ø—Ä–µ—Ç–Ω–∞—è –ª—é–±–æ–≤—å. Forbidden Love\\", ‚Äî Russia, Moscow, Rodina, 2020 \\"–ó–∞–ø—Ä–µ—Ç–Ω–∞—è –ª—é–±–æ–≤—å. Forbidden Love\\" E-book: The Twenty Third Century: Nontraditional Love, ‚Äî Strelbytskyy Multimedia Publishing, 2017 Twenty Third Century: Nontraditional love\\", Strelbytskyy Multimedia Publishing  Critical reception  Mariano Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez, Doctor in Philology and a member of the research group on utopias and future history HISTOPIA (Universidad Aut√≥noma de Madrid) wrote in (Anti)Gay Utopian Fiction in English and Romance Languages: an Overview: ‚ÄòWe can doubt whether the celebration of a hypothetically persecuted heterosexuality as a symbol of the right to difference in later gay dystopias... Among them, there is a relatively recent one, written in Russian and translated into English in 2008, Rafael Grugman‚Äòs Nontraditional Love. As it is the case in earlier examples of homosexual domination, at least from ‚ÄúThe Crooked Man‚Äù onwards, the heterosexual male hero-victim in this novel must come to terms with the fact that he is a member of a rejected minority, from which he and his female partner must hide their love through family arrangements with fellow-minded and orientated couples. In this future Earth, a global accident has turned most people from heterosexual to homosexual, as well as their descendants, while former homosexuals have become heterosexuals, bringing about a full reversal. Biological maternity had to be replaced by gestational surrogacy for both gay and lesbian couples, now forming the majority... Regarding Grugman's heterosexist ‚Äòtraditional‚Äò perspective, it may be of interest to compare Nontraditional Love with an earlier lesbian narrative, Cy Jung's H√©t√©ro par-ci, homo par le rat (1999), which is set in a fictional world similar to the one imagined by Grugman...' In Rodr√≠guez opinion, ‚ÄòConsciously or not, Grugman‚Äòs narrative echoes current discourses against gay and lesbian assertiveness underlying legislation enacted to prevent any alleged gay proselytizism... Homosexuality is thus presented as a threat to society at large, and Grugman just turns this threat into reality in his dystopia. At any rate, Grugman offers a late specimen of anti-gay utopia in a period when homosexuality had virtually disappeared from the utopian genre, except for a few appropriations of it by the gays themselves, after the long silence in the closet.‚ÄôMariano Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez, (Anti)Gay Utopian Fiction in English and Romance Languages: an Overview‚Äô‚Äô, MORUS ‚Äì Utopia e Renascimento, v. 11, n. 1, 2016, p. 217-218 Debbie Pope writes in March 2016, Issue 8 of Lateral Magazine: The freedom of a genre: Sexuality in speculative fiction: 'In another twist of today's society, Nontraditional Love by Rafael Grugman (2008) puts together an upside-down society where heterosexuality is outlawed, and homosexuality is the norm. A ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô family unit consists of two dads with a surrogate mother. Alternatively, two mothers, one of whom bares a child. In a nod to the always-progressive Netherlands, this country is the only country progressive enough to allow opposite sex marriage. This is perhaps the most obvious example of cognitive estrangement. It puts the reader in the shoes of the oppressed by modelling an entire world of opposites around a fairly ‚Äúnormal‚Äù everyday heterosexual protagonist. A heterosexual reader would not only be able to identify with the main character, but be immersed in a world as oppressive and bigoted as the real world has been for homosexuals and the queer community throughout history.The freedom of a genre: Sexuality in speculative fiction, Lateral Magazine, March 2016, Issue 8 ‚ÄúPolitically, I‚Äôd give this book five stars for what it attempts and accomplishes.

He was one of the first U.S. physicians to complete a fellowship in pediatric ophthalmology. Apt identified that povidone-iodine could be safety used as an antimicrobial for the eyes. In addition to his work in ophthalmology, Apt devised a number of diagnostic tests. The Apt test is performed on blood in a baby's stools to determine whether it is of maternal or fetal origin. Biography Apt was born in Philadelphia. He started college at the University of Pennsylvania when he was 14. After graduating from Penn, he earned a medical degree from Jefferson Medical College in 1945. After residency training at Harvard University and the University of Cincinnati, he became the first pediatric ophthalmology fellow at the National Institutes of Health. Associated with the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA from 1961 to his death, Apt established the pediatric ophthalmology division there, the first such division at a U.S. medical school. He was a co- founder of the Jules Stein Eye Institute at UCLA. Apt and a colleague, Sherwin Isenberg, examined the practice of instilling silver nitrate or antibiotics in the eye before an eye surgery. They found that such techniques increased the risk of infection. Apt proposed the use of povidone-iodine to treat or prevent eye infections. A 1990s study in Kenya established the solution as effective. The low cost of povidone-iodine provided another advantage for its use, especially in the developing world. Early in Apt's career, eye surgeons commonly used sutures that were made of catgut or collagen materials. Some children experienced allergic reactions to these substances, sometimes leading to severe visual problems. Apt studied the problem and determined that a suture could first be placed in a child's forearm to observe for reactions. The AAP Section on Ophthalmology established the Leonard Apt, MD, Lectureship, which is delivered every two years at the meeting of the American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus by a nationally known expert in a field related to pediatric ophthalmology. Many of Apt's innovations were outside of pediatric ophthalmology. He was one of the early physicians to adopt the use of plastic tubing and containers in blood transfusions. Such transfusions had usually been given with glass or metal equipment. He was the first to report on a case of an immune system disorder known as agammaglobulinemia. The Apt test is performed when a newborn passes blood into the stool; it differentiates between swallowed maternal blood and blood originating from the newborn. Swallowing of maternal blood can occur at delivery, while infant gastrointestinal bleeding may account for blood coming from the baby. In February 2013, Apt died of a brief heart-related illness in Santa Monica, California.

The painting depicts a snowscape with many Parisians, young and old, spending leisure time on a frozen park lake. Due to Renoir's strong dislike of cold temperatures and snow, the piece is one of his few winter landscapes. Background Pierre-Auguste Renoir (1841‚Äì1919) first met landscape painters Alfred Sisley (1839‚Äì1899), Claude Monet (1840‚Äì1926), and figure painter Fr√©d√©ric Bazille (1841‚Äì1870) at the art studio of Swiss artist Charles Gleyre in 1861. In addition to their friendship, all would prove influential in Renoir's work. For the next several years, Renoir attended the √âcole des Beaux-Arts. He first exhibited a large painting at the Salon in 1863, but destroyed his work. That same year, Renoir was living in a studio with Bazille who introduced him to Paul C√©zanne (1839‚Äì1906) and Camille Pissarro (1830‚Äì1903). An early painting, The Cabaret of M√®re Anthony (1866), represents for Renoir \\"some of the most agreeable memories\\" of his life with friends at a village inn during this time. He soon moved to the village of Chailly near Marlotte and the forest of Fontainebleau, and began working with model Lise Tr√©hot who posed for him between 1866 and 1872. Renoir began painting at La Grenouill√®re, a popular middle class day resort with a floating dance hall, in late 1868.Vollard, Ambroise (1925). Renoir: An Intimate Record. Courier Corporation. pp. 9‚Äì20. . . Like Monet and several other Impressionists, Renoir worked en plein air, painting outdoors, but unlike Monet, who was known for painting in the cold and snow, Renoir was not fond of cold temperatures.Karlins, N. F. (July 7, 1999). \\"Winter in New York\\". Artnet. Retrieved March 31, 2015. Years later, he told art dealer Ambroise Vollard that he could not stand the cold: \\"But then, even if you can stand the cold, why paint snow? It is a blight on the face of Nature.\\" Although it is unknown when his symptoms began, Renoir was known to suffer from rheumatoid arthritis from at least 1892 onward, an affliction which would severely restrict his artistic production in late life. Description Renoir, who was then 26 years old, painted Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne in the public park of Bois de Boulogne in Paris en plein air during the cold winter month of January 1868. Newspaper accounts of the time recorded freezing temperatures allowing people to walk across the Seine and ice skate on rivers and streams. Due to Renoir's dislike of cold temperatures, it is one of the few winter landscapes he completed aside from a few minor studies.Groom, Gloria. Jill Shaw (ed). (2014). \\"Cat. 8 Seascape, 1879: Curatorial Entry\\". Renoir Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago. Art Institute of Chicago. Paragraph 2, Footnote 2. . . At the time of the painting, the park itself was relatively new, with construction beginning in 1852 under a public works program led by Georges-Eug√®ne Haussmann under the direction of Napoleon III. Under Haussmann's renovation of Paris, the Bois de Boulogne was completed in 1858.Bailey, Colin B. Christopher Riopelle (2007). Renoir Landscapes: 1865‚Äì1883. National Gallery London. p. 43. . . The scene is thought to have been painted near the Lac pour le patinage (Skating Lake), an artificial lake.Renoir Paintings and Drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago. Cat. 10 Near the Lake, 1879/80. Renoir chose the park because he preferred painting crowds.Sweeney, Jim (Jan‚ÄìFeb 1999). \\"The Impressionists Paint Winter: A Special Effect\\". Weatherwise (Taylor & Francis Group) 52 (1): 22. . . The painting has an unfinished, sketch-like quality to it, in the style of a pochade, but the brushwork is bold and the composition fully realized. The scene represents the western part of the park, using an elevated perspective. The theme evokes older Dutch ice skating landscapes made popular by painters like Hendrick Avercamp (1585‚Äì1634).Moffett, Charles S. (ed). Lisa Portnoy Stein (1999). Impressionists in Winter: Effets de Neige. Phillips Collection. pp. 17, 131‚Äì133, 212‚Äì213. . Herbert, Robert L. (1988). Impressionism: Art, Leisure, and Parisian Society.

Impressionist Cats & Dogs: Pets in the Painting of Modern Life. Yale University Press. pp. 73, 83. . The motif of social leisure depicted in the piece would come to define Renoir's subsequent work. Other work Snowy Landscape (1870‚Äì1875), Mus√©e de l'Orangerie, Paris There are at least four known snowscapes by Renoir: Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne (1868); Winter Landscape (1868); Snowy Landscape (1870‚Äì1875); and another work also titled Snowy Landscape (1875).As cited in Renoir: Paintings and drawings at the Art Institute of Chicago, paragraph 2, footnote 2: \\"The four known winter scenes are Skaters in the Bois de Boulogne (1868; Collection of William I.

Dars Celestine (1991). The Impressionists Handbook. Sterling Publishing Company. p. 92. . Provenance The piece is currently held in the private art collection of William I.

Architecture and Ornamentation Exterior The church fa√ßade is of barn-style Baroque, a style that has been described as typically found in most Spanish-era churches in the Philippines. It features side pillars capped by urn-like finials, pilasters that divide the fa√ßade into five segments and cornices that divide the expanse of the wall into two levels. The pediment is semi-arched and ends into two small volutes before tapering down to the sides. It is adorned by a framed saint's niche flanked by two hexagonal windows. A concrete porte cochere has been added later into the structure. To the left of the church rises the four-level, slender belfry. The two uppermost levels are octagonal and are pierced with rectangular, circular and semicircular arched campanile windows. Interior 18th century altarpiece featuring the seven archangels and a tableau of the Holy Family The main altarpiece or retablo, which was done in the early 18th century, is done in Rococo style.

Accident Air Canada Flight 624 departed from Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ) bound for Halifax Stanfield International Airport (YHZ). It was carrying 133 passengers and five crew. The Airbus A320 operating the flight, registration C-FTJP, impacted the ground short of the threshold of runway 05 (which is not equipped for precision landing), smashing through an ILS-LOC antenna array. This impact caused the landing gear to separate from the aircraft. The plane also impacted a power line, which cut power to the airport. The aircraft then climbed an embankment up to the runway level, skidded on its belly and stopped past the threshold. The Halifax airport was without electricity for about 90 minutes. The aircraft was extensively damaged, having lost all landing gear and its port engine. The wings and tailplane were also damaged. Both pilots, twenty- three passengers and a flight attendant were taken to hospital. None of the injuries were life-threatening,Final report, p.7 and all but one of those taken to hospital were released the same day. The weather at the time of the accident was described as \\"stormy\\" (winter conditions). The loss of power to the airport was due to the aircraft clipping transmission lines before hitting the ground. Electricity was restored to the airport by 02:12 ADT.Final report, p.7, section 1.4 While the aircraft collided with objects outside the airport perimeter and was damaged beyond repair, Air Canada initially described the accident as a \\"hard landing\\". Aircraft The aircraft was an Airbus A320-211 equipped with two CFM56-5A1 engines. Its serial number was 233 with a fleet number of 214, and it first flew in 1991. It was owned by GECAS and leased to Air Canada. As a result of the accident, the aircraft was written off. Investigation The accident was investigated by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. Three Bureau d'Enqu√™tes et d'Analyses pour la S√©curit√© de l'Aviation Civile (BEA) investigators from France and two technical advisers from Airbus travelled to Canada to participate in the investigation.\\"Flight AC 624, Airbus A320, registered C-FTJP ‚Äì Halifax Stanfield International Airport (Canada), 29 March 2015\\" (Archive). Bureau d'Enqu√™tes et d'Analyses pour la S√©curit√© de l'Aviation Civile. Retrieved on April 2, 2015. As a result of the accident, Air Canada revised its incorrect Airbus A320-200 Standard Operating Procedure. The final report was released in May 2017, and showed no mechanical faults contributing to the accident. Instead pilot error was mainly to blame, as the crew followed relevant Air Canada flying procedures that contradicted Airbus and pilot training guidelines. Investigators determined that the airline's standard operating procedure in regard to the selected landing mode (Flight Path Angle Guidance) was over-reliant on the Airbus' automation and lead to excessive loss of altitude. Per the SOP, the crew need not have monitored the aircraft's altitude or relation to the runway to make any subsequent adjustments to the flight path angle after the final approach fix. Subsequently, the captain and first officer failed to notice or respond to the fact that the aircraft autopilot selected a steep vertical angle flight path, causing a drop below the minimum safe altitude. Furthermore, limited visibility hampered the crew's ability to accurately perceive their surroundings.  Litigation  A class action lawsuit was introduced against Air Canada, the Halifax Airport, NAV Canada, Transport Canada, Airbus and the aircraft's pilots which alleges that negligence on the part of the defendants caused the crash, inflicting physical and psychological harm onto the passengers. Other separate lawsuits are being assessed by medical professionals, with settlements based on the relative severity of each client's injuries. On 30 March 2017, Air Canada filed a lawsuit against Airbus, alleging that the manufacturer \\"failed to identify shortcomings of the Airbus A320\\", which included uncommanded descent below the pre-programmed glide path.

He reigned under the name of Outey Reachea III (). Ang Chan II was the eldest son of Ang Eng. Ang Eng died in 1796 when Ang Chan II was only five years old. Prince Talaha Pok (, ) was appointed the regent of Cambodia. Ang Chan II was not allowed to go to Cambodia until Pok died in 1806. In 1806, Ang Chan II was crowned king by Siamese. His two brothers, Ang Em and Ang Snguon, were pro-Siamese. In order to gain power from the two brothers, Ang Chan got closer to the Vietnamese. In the next year, he started to pay tribute to Vietnam. Two Vietnamese officials, Ng√¥ Nh√¢n T·ªãnh and Tr·∫ßn C√¥ng ƒê√†n, came to Longvek and granted him the title Cao Mi√™n qu·ªëc v∆∞∆°ng (\\"king of Cambodia\\"). Siamese demanded Ang Chan to appoint Ang Snguon and Ang Em as the uprayorach and ouparach respectively but Ang Chan refused. In 1811, with the help of Siamese, Ang Snguon overthrew him. Ang Chan fled to Saigon. His two brothers were appointed the regent by Siamese. In 1813, a Vietnamese army under L√™ VƒÉn Duy·ªát invaded Cambodia and captured Oudong. Ang Chan returned with the Vietnamese army. Ang Em and Ang Snguon fled to Bangkok. After the rebellion, Cambodia was put under protection of Vietnam. Vietnamese built two castles, Nam Vang (Phnom Penh) and La Y√™m (Lvea Aem), to station their forces. 1000 men under Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Tho·∫°i were sent to Phnom Penh to \\"protect\\" him. He was ordered to collect Cambodian Royal Chronicles in 1818. In 1819, Ang Chan sent 5,000 Khmer labours to reconstruct the Vietnamese Vƒ©nh T·∫ø Canal. An anti- Vietnamese rebellion broke out in the next year, but was put down by Vietnamese army. Ang Chan died in 1834, his second daughter Ang Mey was installed the queen.

Description To use this method, one proves that the history of the given process can be recorded in an efficient way, such that the state of the process at any past time can be recovered from the current state and this record, and such that the amount of additional information that is recorded at each step of the process is (on average) less than the amount of new information randomly generated at each step. The resulting growing discrepancy in total information content can never exceed the fixed amount of information in the current state, from which it follows that the process must eventually terminate. This principle can be formalized and made rigorous using Kolmogorov complexity.. Example An example given by both Fortnow and Tao concerns the Boolean satisfiability problem for Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form, with uniform clause size. These problems can be parameterized by two numbers (k,t) where k is the number of variables per clause and t is the maximum number of different clauses that any variable can appear in. If the variables are assigned to be true or false randomly, then the event that a clause is unsatisfied happens with probability 2‚àík and each event is independent of all but r = k(t ‚àí 1) other events. It follows from the Lov√°sz local lemma that, if t is small enough to make r < 2k/e (where e is the base of the natural logarithm) then a solution always exists. The following algorithm can be shown using entropy compression to find such a solution when r is smaller by a constant factor than this bound: *Choose a random truth assignment *While there exists an unsatisfied clause C, call a recursive subroutine fix with C as its argument. This subroutine chooses a new random truth assignment for the variables in C, and then recursively calls the same subroutine on all unsatisfied clauses (possibly including C itself) that share a variable with C. This algorithm cannot terminate unless the input formula is satisfiable, so a proof that it terminates is also a proof that a solution exists. Each iteration of the outer loop reduces the number of unsatisfied clauses (it causes C to become satisfied without making any other clause become unsatisfied) so the key question is whether the fix subroutine terminates or whether it can get into an infinite recursion. To answer this question, consider on the one hand the number of random bits generated in each iteration of the fix subroutine (k bits per clause) and on the other hand the number of bits needed to record the history of this algorithm in such a way that any past state can be generated. To record this history, we may store the current truth assignment (n bits), the sequence of initial arguments to the fix subroutine (m log m bits, where m is the number of clauses in the input), and then a sequence of records that either indicate that a recursive call to fix returned or that it in turn made another call to one of the r + 1 clauses (including C itself) that share a variable with C. There are r + 2 possible outcomes per record, so the number of bits needed to store a record is log r + O(1). This information can be used to recover the sequence of clauses given as recursive arguments to fix. The truth assignments at each stage of this process can then be recovered (without having to record any additional information) by progressing backwards through this sequence of clauses, using the fact that each clause was previously unsatisfiable to infer the values of all of its variables prior to each fix call. Thus, after f calls to fix, the algorithm will have generated fk random bits but its entire history (including those generated bits) can be recovered from a record that uses only m log m + n + f log r + O(f) bits. It follows that, when r is small enough to make log r + O(1) < k, the fix subroutine can only perform O(m log m + n) recursive calls over the course of the whole algorithm. History The name \\"entropy compression\\" was given to this method in a blog posting by Terence Tao. and has since been used for it by other researchers.... Moser's original version of the algorithmic Lov√°sz local lemma, using this method, achieved weaker bounds than the original Lov√°sz local lemma, which was originally formulated as an existence theorem without a constructive method for finding the object whose existence it proves. Later, Moser and G√°bor Tardos used the same method to prove a version of the algorithmic Lov√°sz local lemma that matches the bounds of the original lemma.. Since the discovery of the entropy compression method, it has also been used to achieve stronger bounds for some problems than would be given by the Lov√°sz local lemma. For example, for the problem of acyclic edge coloring of graphs with maximum degree Œî, it was first shown using the local lemma that there always exists a coloring with 64Œî colors, and later using a stronger version of the local lemma this was improved to 9.62Œî. However, a more direct argument using entropy compression shows that there exists a coloring using only 4(Œî ‚àí 1) colors, and moreover this coloring can be found in randomized polynomial time.

He is the Founder Director of Students' Information & Guidance Bureau, an institution recognised for educational counselling. solving unemployment problems and for supporting and encouraging students to pursue their educational programs for further employment and choice of career. V.V.Shenoy died on 9 March 2015 due to medical complications.Shenoy, Vasudev. \\"V.V.Shenoy is no more\\", Times Of India, Belgaum, 10 March 2015. Early life V. V. Shenoy was born on 15 Feb 1940 in Borkatte, Karkala Taluk, Karnataka. He did his initial schooling in a small village elementary school in Borkatte. Due to the poor financial conditions at home he got out at the very young age of 14 and ventured out in search of work. He then pursued his high school education at S.V.T. Higher Elementary School, St. Thomas High School, Honnavar and then Janata Vidyalaya, Dandeli , part by part, with the help of the finances he managed to earn through the chores he did at various places. He then came to Belgaum around the year 1963 to pursue his higher education and did his Bachelor of Science at R.L.S. College, Belgaum. He was known for his commanding and leadership qualities and always had a soft corner for all his fellow students and other people. Be it Academics, extracurricular activities, National Cadet Corps (India), representing the college or various other organizations and other social activities, he's known to excel in all. During his B.Sc education days, he had to support his family back in his hometown as well as look after his basic needs in Belgaum. This is when he saw and realized the amount of difficulties students faced at their peak age of career decision making and education attaining phase. He then pursued and successfully completed his Bachelor of Education in Belgaum as he believed that it would help him in understanding the students‚Äô issues and the situation of the educational system. In the year 1968 he started (invented) a unique organization called Students' Information & Guidance Bureau . This organization served (and still does) over 60 lac members/students by solving, guiding and helping them achieve their higher education and career choices. In the last ~40 years, he worked and served in innumerable organizations/fields mainly including Journalism, Horticulture and Kannada & Konkani Culture, Literature and Traditions. He always believed that it was not necessary to be a Politician, Minister or a Celebrity to be a social worker and work for the welfare of the people.

Shenoy at SIGB Students' Information & Guidance Bureau or SIGB was founded by Vasudev V Shenoy in the year 1968. He was approx 28 years old when he started the institution. Located at Shanivar Khoot, Kakatives in Belgaum City, this Institution provides guidance, detailed information of various courses available at various universities, apprenticeship available at private industrial sectors, scholarships provided by various institutions, government job opportunities, detailed information of banking, LIC and other such examinations, competitive exams, engineering and medical education facilities, job opportunities available for the youth and many other such information in and around Belgaum city and North Karnataka. The institution also had a branch office at Tilakwadi, Belgaum for over 30 years which was later closed in 2006 as he preferred concentrating and personally attending to and devoting his time at one place at the head office. This Institution is not a Government run office, Employment Exchange, University Branch office/Agency or any other Institute but a private run Institution for the well-being of the students. SIGB has further sub sections of functioning i.e. STUDENTS‚Äô HELPLINE through which candidates pursue their U.G and P.G correspondence courses for a couple of Universities in Karnataka and STUDENTS‚Äô BOOK BUREAU where the latest and current Job Opportunities in various sectors are managed for the candidates. DG and IGP, Karnataka Mr. OmPrakash with Shenoy at his office Students' Information & Guidance Bureau A separate division was started for providing special guidance to the youth and the underprivileged in 1981. The then Education Minister G.B.Shankar Rao inaugurated this division and officially became the first member on that day. V.V. Shenoy personally attended to and guided most of the students to attain information and achieve education in their particular preferred field of interest. A lot of poor or underprivileged students seeking help guidance or information, have gained much so that they could complete their education. He had a wide range of sources from where he collected all the knowledge and information which he imparted onto the candidates. Important information/ news / ads reported in the various newspapers in various languages are compiled and made available on the notice board for the candidates‚Äô perusal on a daily basis. Job opportunities list is made available to all the candidates on the notice board. Guides, Books, Old/model question papers thousands of reference books and important education, commerce, science, current affairs etc. related documents, collected from over the last 30 years are made available for the candidates‚Äô reference. This institution has helped and has had above 60 lakh members over the time.

Mr. Shenoy addressing the audience at the Horticulture Show, Hume Park, Belgaum. An interesting \\"laboratory\\" for students of the schools around, a pleasant spot for visitors to the house to chat in, a cool tension free retreat for the family to spend an evening in ‚Äì this is what V.V. Shenoy has created on his modest terrace. In his own words, his garden is a combination of Duty and Beauty. When this duty is undertaken with an eye for beauty, the effort takes a marvelous shape, with vegetable and fruit trees, flowering plants, Crotons and herbs swaying happily in perfect harmony. The variety of plants and trees blending perfectly into a harmony of colors and shapes is bewilderingly wide that it needs the owner to introduce to some of the rare ones. In this garden the mighty Banyan tree stands side by side with the humble shoe flower plant, the common Tulsi, Neem, Bluebells, Jasmines and Roses. The spicy Clove, Cardamom, Pepper, Jaiphal and Coffee, rub shoulders (or rather branches) with the fragrant Champa, Dreamy Rajnigandha, colourful Mayflower and prosaic Rubber and Coconut trees. All are planted in pots 22\\" and less in height! Even the spaces below the bigger trees like Jamun, Seedless Mangoes, Chickoo, Mosambi, Pomegranate, Areca nut, Lemon and Guavas are lined with useful herbs like Ajwain, Pudina, Coriander, Lemongrass, Brahmi and Betel Leaves. One can see fruits growing in the most unbelievable conditions like a Mango of the size of a complete human palm, growing on a tree/plant just 3 feet tall, pineapples growing in the pot, large sized pomegranates, lemons, button oranges, sugar lemons, and even 15\\" long ladies finger on a long slender plant. The garden also boasts of exotic plants like Strawberries, Annapurna (a long leafy plant which put in the cooker while making rice gives an aroma of Basmati rice), AloeVera, Wild Berries, White Jamun or the Jaam, Starfruit, Chayote, Stevia (a plant very famous for diabetes controlling and eradicating powers), Brahmakamal and many more The little green empire on the roof, making a mockery of the usual rough and rugged concrete terrace also mocks at the main misconception connected with gardening ‚Äì that gardening is the monopoly of the aristocratic with sprawling acres, plenty of money to spend on manure, saplings and gardeners. This garden is looked after by the family themselves without any professional gardener on duty which is a matter of pride and pleasure for them. This also leads to another fascinating hobby of ornithology, because of the innumerable birds coming in, thanks to the flowers and fruits. Natural manure consisting of household waste, dried leaves and flowers from the garden etc. is used in place of chemical and artificial manures. This does away with the problem of garbage disposal and also ill effects of chemical fertilizers are avoided. V. V. Shenoy followed the phrase ‚Äúkasa dinda rasa‚Äù (best out of waste) very practically. It is not the availability of the water alone that is important but correct management. All the waste water from the kitchen etc. is diverted to the garden for the plants. This terrace garden also serves as a natural air conditioner for the house controlling the temperature inside it. The natural conditions created within the pots are perhaps excellent guards against extremes of temperatures. Thus even seasonal fruits and vegetables are reaped almost throughout the year. The accolades of distinguished visitors like the then Union Agriculture Minister Balram Jakhar, Mr. Suresh Angadi, M.P, Bharatiya Janata Party . Dr. Vittal Rai, Vice-Chancellor of the Agriculture University, Dharwad, Dr. Beer Singh Chowdary, President of the Bharat Krishika Samaj , U.T. Alwa, Special Secretary to the Government of Karnataka, Forest Department Environment and Ecology have added to the enthusiasm of the garden lover. The Shenoy family believes that if everybody follows this practice, of having at least a small group of plants, will keep the cities cool, green and above all healthy. V.V. Shenoy has also worked as one of the Directors of the Horticulture Department, Belgaum. Flower and Fruit shows and exhibitions and competitions have been organized every year in Hume Park, Club Road, Belgaum, under the able guidance and active participation of V. V. Shenoy. He organized, conducted and managed to dedicatedly work for the research and development of plants even amidst his busy schedule involving his activities of his office.  Personal life  V.V. Shenoy married Aruna, daughter of Smt. Rukmini & Shri. Laxman Prabhu, Headmaster S.V.T. School , Karkala, in the year 1976. They have three children, Dr. Rashmi V. Shenoy, Chetan V. Shenoy and Anupkumar V.

It is open every day between 07:00-17:00. History A closer look of a tomb of fallen Allied soldier in WWII in Thanbyuzayat War Cemetery The Burma-Siam railway, built by Commonwealth, Dutch and American prisoners of war, was a Japanese project driven by the need for improved communications to support the large Japanese army in Burma. During its construction, approximately 13,000 prisoners of war died and were buried along the railway. An estimated 80,000 to 100,000 civilians also died in the course of the project, chiefly forced labour brought from Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, or conscripted in Siam (Thailand) and Burma (Myanmar). Two labour forces, one based in Siam and the other in Burma worked from opposite ends of the line towards the centre. The Japanese aimed at completing the railway in 14 months and work began in October 1942. The line, 424 kilometres long, was completed by December 1943. Thanbyuzayat became a prisoner of war administration headquarters and base camp in September 1942 and in January 1943 a base hospital was organised for the sick. The camp was close to a railway marshalling yard and workshops, and heavy casualties were sustained among the prisoners during Allied bombing raids in March and June 1943. The camp was then evacuated and the prisoners, including the sick, were marched to camps further along the line where camp hospitals were set up. For some time, however, Thanbyuzayat continued to be used as a reception centre for the groups of prisoners arriving at frequent intervals to reinforce the parties working on the line up to the Burma-Siam border. The graves of those who died during the construction and maintenance of the Burma-Siam railway (except for the Americans, whose remains were repatriated) were transferred from camp burial grounds and isolated sites along the railway into three cemeteries at Chungkai and Kanchanaburi in Thailand and Thanbyuzayat in Myanmar. Thanbyuzayat War Cemetery was designed by Colin St Clair Oakes and created by the Army Graves Service who transferred to it all burials along the northern section of the railway, between Moulmein and Nieke. The burials in Thanbyuzayat War Cemetery also includes Allied POWs who died of sickness or were executed by the Japanese at Victoria Point Myeiki, Dawei and Mawlamyine, between June and September 1942. There are 3,005 Commonwealth and 621 Dutch burials of the Second World War in the Thanbyuzayat War Cemetery.

It covers an area of and lies mostly in County Leitrim with a smaller part in County Sligo. Glencar Waterfall is located near the lake's north shore on the Leitrim side. Geography Crannog at eastern end Glencar Lough lies in the Glencar Valley, between the Dartry Mountains to the north and the mountain range including Cope's Mountain to the south. The lake is located about northeast of Sligo and about west of Manorhamilton. It is long from west to east and wide. The lake has two crannogs (artificial islands): one at the western end near the Drumcliff River outlet and the other at the eastern end near the Diffreen River. South towards Cope's Mountain Hydrology Glencar Waterfall Glencar Lough is primarily fed by Glencar Waterfall, on the lake's northern shore, and by the Diffreen River, entering at the lake's eastern end. Sruth in Aghaidh an Aird also flows out to the northern shore, just west of the Glencar Waterfall outflow. The lake drains west into the Drumcliff River, which in turn flows into Sligo Bay. Lake depth is greatest near the southern shore with a shallower shelf at the northern shore. Natural history Photo by Robert French, taken before 1914 Fish present in Glencar Lough include salmon and brown trout. Bird life includes tufted duck, pochard and goldeneye. These are migratory species which winter at the lake. Ecology The water quality was reported to be excellent with an oligotrophic rating. The ecology of Glencar Lough, and other Irish waterways, remain threatened by curly waterweed, zebra mussel, and freshwater clam invasive species. History Historically Glencar Valley was known as Glenn-Dallain and was part of the Kingdom of Breifne. The lake and its crannogs, then occupied, are mentioned in the Annals of the Four Masters, specifically the eastern crannog where \\"the sons of Donough O'Rourke, i.e. Donnell and Ferganainm, made an attack upon the crannog, and privately set fire to the town\\". Economy Barite was mined at Glencarbury in the Dartry Mountains above the lake between 1894 and 1979. A cable ropeway from the mine area to the lake shore was constructed in 1942. By this means the extracted barite was taken down for onward road transport. The Glencar Water Company has its bottling plant located near the lake's northern shore. The company, established in 2008, sells water drawn from an onsite spring emanating from within the nearby Dartry Mountains.

It was shut down after a law enforcement action as a part of Operation Bayonet against it (and also the Hansa market) in the United States, Canada, and Thailand, reported 13 July 2017. The alleged founder, Alexandre Cazes, a Canadian citizen born on 19 October 1991, was found dead in his cell in Thailand several days after his arrest; suicide is suspected.AlphaBay taken down by law enforcement across 3 countries, WSJ says, Cyrus Farivar - 14 July 2017  History  AlphaBay was reportedly launched in September 2014, pre-launched in November 2014 and officially launched on December 22, 2014. It saw a steady growth, with 14,000 new users in the first 90 days of operation. The darknet informer website Gwern.net placed AlphaBay Market in the top tier of markets regarding the 6-month survival probability and it had proven to be successful. In October 2015, it was recognized as the largest online darknet market according to Dan Palumbo, research director at Digital Citizens Alliance. Non-standard services included customisable digital contracts around building reputations. In May 2015, the site announced an integrated digital contracts and escrow system. The contract system allows users to make engagements and agree to provide services in the future, according to the terms of the contract. By October 2015, AlphaBay had over 200,000 users. At the time of its demise in July 2017, AlphaBay had over 400,000 users. AlphaBay was noteworthy in the world of darknet markets for accepting another cryptocurrency in addition to bitcoin; support for Monero, supposedly more anonymous, was implemented at the end of August 2016.  Site breaches  In April 2016, AlphaBay's API was compromised leading to 13,000 messages being stolen. In January 2017, the API was once again compromised, allowing over 200,000 private messages from the last 30 days and a list of user names to be leaked. The attack was from a single hacker who was paid by AlphaBay for the disclosure. AlphaBay reported that the exploit had only been used in conjunction with this attack and not used previously.  News coverage  On March 28, 2015, AlphaBay Market made the news for selling stolen Uber accounts. Uber made a statement regarding a potential data breach: > \\"We investigated and found no evidence of a breach. Attempting to > fraudulently access or sell accounts is illegal and we notified the > authorities about this report. This is a good opportunity to remind people > to use strong and unique usernames and passwords and to avoid reusing the > same credentials across multiple sites and services.\\" In October 2015, the London-based telecommunications company TalkTalk sustained a major hack. The stolen data was put for sale on AlphaBay Market, which led to the arrest of a 15-year-old boy. TalkTalk CEO Dido Harding issued the following statement: > \\"TalkTalk constantly updates its systems to make sure they are as secure as > possible against the rapidly evolving threat of cyber crime, impacting an > increasing number of individuals and organisations. We take any threat to > the security of our customers' data extremely seriously and we are taking > all the necessary steps to understand what has happened here.\\" In August 2017, AlphaBay was revealed as a possible venue by which one of the perpetrators of the 2017 Jewish Community Center bomb threats sold a \\"School Email Bomb Threat Service.\\" This individual, Michael Kadar, made 245 threatening calls to schools and community centers. Criminologist David Decary-Hetu noted this event as notable for being the first example of criminal services being sold over a darkmarket. He said, \\"All the cases I have heard of so far turned out to be law enforcement trying to find people of interest,\\" making this case unique in his experience to that point. Seizure and shutdown alt= By July 2017, AlphaBay was ten times the size of its predecessor Silk Road (which was busted in October 2013), had over 369,000 listings, 400,000 users, was facilitating US$600,000-$800,000 of transactions per day, and had reportedly built a strong reputation. However, a series of elementary operational security errors lead to its downfall: * About the time the service first began in December 2014, Cazes used his Hotmail address pimp_alex_91@hotmail.com as the 'From' address in system generated welcome and password reset emails, which he also used for his LinkedIn profile and his legitimate computer repair business in Canada. * Cazes used a pseudonym to run the site which he had previously used (e.g., in carding and tech forums) since at least 2008, and variously advertised this identity as the \\"designer\\", \\"administrator\\" and \\"owner\\" of the site * When Cazes was arrested, he was logged into his laptop performing an administrative reboot on an AlphaBay server in direct response to a law-enforcement created artificial system failure; furthermore, encryption was wholly absent on said laptop. * Cazes' laptop reportedly contained an unencrypted personal net worth statement mapping all global assets across multiple jurisdictions, conveniently leading police to complete asset seizure. * The servers were hosted at a company in Canada directly linked to his person. * The servers contained multiple constantly open (unencrypted) hot cryptocurrency wallets. * Cazes' flashy use of proceeds to purchase property, passports and luxury cars and frequent online boasting about his financial successes, including posting videos of himself driving luxury cars acquired through illegal proceeds, not only revealed his geographical location, it perforce made denying connection to the service impossible. * Assets acquired through proceeds were held in a variety of accounts directly linked to Cazes, his wife and companies they owned in Thailand (the same jurisdiction they lived), as well as directly held personal accounts in Liechtenstein, Cyprus, Switzerland and Antigua. * Cazes' statements about the goal of the site -- \\"launched in September 2014 and its goal is to become the largest eBay-style underworld marketplace\\" -- helped to legally establish intent. Timeline Law enforcement took at least one month to obtain a US warrant, then over one month to obtain foreign warrants, prepare for and execute searches and seizures in Canada and Thailand: *Early May 2017: Law Enforcement verifiably active on the site since at least this period. *1 June 2017: Warrant issued by United States District Court for the Eastern District of California for racketeering, narcotics trafficking, identity theft and access device fraud, transfer of false ID, trafficking in illegal device making equipment, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. *30 June 2017: Warrant is issued for Cazes' arrest in Thailand at US request. *5 July 2017 **Canadian police raid EBX Technologies in Montreal, Cazes' Canadian company and the reported location of the physical servers, as well as two residential properties in Trois-Rivi√®res. **Cazes is arrested in Bangkok at his dwelling at Phutthamonthon Sai 3 Road in Thawi Watthana district which is searched by the Royal Thai Police, with the help of the FBI and DEA. *12 July 2017: Cazes' suspected suicide by hanging while in custody at Thailand's Narcotics Suppression Bureau headquarters in Laksi district, Bangkok, is reportedly discovered at 7AM. He was due to face US extradition. *16 July 2017: Cazes' wife is reported as having been charged with money laundering. *20 July 2017; U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announces shutdown of the site. *23 July 2017: Narcotics Suppression Bureau chief is interviewed and suggests that more suspects will be arrested soon.

Journal of the Historical Society of South Australia, Nr. 35, 2007 (english).  Location  It was in Gillman near Port Adelaide at the North Arm of the Port River only 9 m away from the North Arm Bridge and North Arm Road. The explosives were stored in the wooden and slated magazine building and in two dynamite hulks moored in Magazine Creek. One of them was a retired iron dredger, built around 1852, and the other was a former lighter. They were seen as a risk, if they should ever explode, because they were close to the new bridge and coastal settlements and inland towns.  Buildings  The North Arm Powder Magazine was built in 1858 by the government. The magazine was built as a lightweight structure on wooden poles due to its location at the tidal creek. Only later this became best practice to mitigate the secondary damage from an explosion by descending d√©bris. As it was close to urbanisation, it was suggested to abandon the site already a decade after it had been commissioned. It was taken out of service only in 1906, after its contents had been moved to the new Dry Creek explosives depot. The building was demolished in 1916 and no visible evidence remains.

She is known for creating the cult vintage store Love Saves The Day or LSD, which operated in New York City's East Village from 1966 until 2009. She is credited for being one of the first to recognize the value of Kitsch items before flea markets became popular. Personal life She was born Leslie Bambi Fishman in Brooklyn, and moved to Manhattan to attend New York University, where she graduated with a fine-art degree. In the early 1970s she operated a vintage store in Hawaii. Her love of vintage clothes and antiques inspired her to open her own store. She became well known in the New York City area, especially amongst thrift store aficionados. Originally she planned to design her own clothing to be featured in the store, but eventually she only sold used clothing, and no original creations. She met her husband, Richard \\"Ritchie\\" Herson, in 1977 when he came to her inquiring about renting an apartment from an ad he saw in The Village Voice. They began dating and soon married. She had a younger sister, Sandy, her mother Hana, and her father Jess. Love Saves The Day Herson opened the original Loves Saves the Day store in 1966 on 77 E. 7th. She stated the name was a nickname for the drug LSD, noting that at that time in the 1960s, many of the people she knew were on drugs. The title is also a symbol of her self-described hippie lifestyle. She was known for her collection of Beatles memorabilia, and the store title was also inspired by the song \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\". The store operated at that location until 1982, when she moved to the now famous location on Second Avenue and E. 7th. Street, from where the store operated from 1983 until 2009. In the summer of 1984, she allowed for filming to take place at the store. The film was Desperately Seeking Susan, in which Madonna and Rosanna Arquette visit the store. Appearing in the film made the store even more popular. Many local artists and production designers came to Leslie for items used for film and stage sets. Inside the store, there was an autograph wall which contained signatures from some of the many famous visitors over the years, including Marc Jacobs, Joey Ramone, Alice Cooper, Bj√∂rk, Kelly Osbourne, Tim Burton, Drea de Matteo, and Debbie Harry. The store was managed by Martin Ruginis, who painted the famous colorful exterior, and created many of the window displays. The store was featured often on television as well. In 1996, MTV VJ Kennedy hosted the show Alternative Nation live from the store. In 2005 the store was in danger of closing due to rent- increases from the landlords. She was able to work out a three-year lease that kept the store going. The original rent on the store was around one hundred dollars per month, which had changed to eleven thousand per month. Store closing and death She died on August 16, 2008 in Carversville, Pennsylvania, at the age of 65. Her husband Richard, who described the store as her \\"canvas\\" as an artist, soon decided he could no longer operate the store in the East Village, and it was announced it would close, which it did in January 2009. The Herson's maintained an apartment in the East Village, and also had a country home in Carversville, and operated a second location of Love Saves the Day in New Hope, Pennsylvania, which her husband continues to operate as of 2015. Some of the window displays Leslie had created caused controversy in the New Hope community due to their extreme nature. On Thursday March 26, 2015, the building that formerly housed the famous Love Saves the Day store was destroyed by the East Village Fire. Many of the local residents mourned the loss of the building where the store once was, as it had been a focal point in East Village, Manhattan counter-culture. After the store closed it was briefly used as a restaurant, but at the time of the fire the store was vacant.

Early life and education Chow was born in 1974 and raised in Manchester by parents who had emigrated to England from Hong Kong. He grew up in a chip shop and says that living in this environment helped him to become an artist. Speaking to the BBC in 2014 Chow said ‚Äúthe reason why I am an illustrator is because growing up, the only form of amusement I had was with a biro and chip paper. I didn't really have many toys when I was a nipper, all I did was draw and draw and draw.‚Äù He was educated at King's School in Macclesfield and during his time there Chow was inspired by his sixth form art teacher Robin Hidden who was himself an illustrator. Chow went on to study at Swindon College of Art on a course which included an exchange placement in Lyon, France. Back in Manchester, Chow worked for a time as a club DJ, regularly playing venues including The Roadhouse and The Night and Day Cafe. Whilst out drinking, Chow would spend time entertaining himself by sketching his friends, who included Elbow's Guy Garvey - using simple line strokes which would eventually become the defining style of his work. Career Early work included creating fashion illustrations for teen magazines Just Seventeen and Sugar but when his father bought him a computer it changed the way he worked as Chow found himself being able to send work to clients digitally. He moved away from drawing and painting and started creating vector-based work using Illustrator, becoming a full-time illustrator in 2006. However, it was in 2007 that his career really took off when his art was spotted by musicians Meg and Jack White from the band The White Stripes. Chow had made a mock poster for the band and Meg and Jack liked it. Months later he was commissioned to create artwork for their Icky Thump album and he designed a limited edition USB flash drive which was later nominated for a Grammy Award in the 'Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package' category. Portraits Much of Chow's work is portraiture, with him specialising in images of celebrities from the worlds of music, television, film and sport. The people he selects to illustrate are spontaneous choices although Chow's love of football can be seen through the amount of portraits he has done of footballers, and his work is influenced by the Panini football stickers which he collected as a child in the 1980s. As a lifelong Manchester United fan Chow also agreed to illustrate poet Tony 'Longfella' Walsh's poem The Govan Boy which was written in tribute to Manchester United football manager Alex Ferguson. The pair both met Ferguson and discussed the project on BBC Radio Manchester. Commissioned Work Chow produces work for a wide range of clients including local businesses and internationally recognised brands. Throughout Manchester his work can be seen at Metrolink tram stops promoting Transport for Greater Manchester‚Äôs Get Me There travel card scheme and in 2014 and 2015 Chow‚Äôs illustrations were commissioned by the Modern Designers agency to promote Chinese New Year celebrations in the city. Internationally, Chow‚Äôs clients include Saatchi & Saatchi, McDonald's, WWE and Wired magazine. He also regularly supplies illustrations to The New Yorker magazine and as well as producing images for articles has created portraits of a number of The New Yorker's featured contributing staff. In 2014, he illustrated a set of characters for advertising agency Leo Burnett UK‚Äôs long term Little Piccadilly interactive campaign for McDonald's. The campaign enabled people to create their own animated characters using their smart phones, which could then be sent live to the McDonald's screen in Piccadilly, London. During that same year he was also invited to the Lego headquarters in Billund, Denmark, where he provided lectures and workshops to graphic designers there. Chow has continued to work with Lego and at the start of 2015 was presented with a Lego mini figure of himself which he had designed. 2015 also saw Chow design one of his most high- profile commissions to date. On 4 October, The New York Times Magazine cover featured a photograph of a metallic helium balloon depicting the face of Presidential hopeful Donald Trump. The balloon was designed by Chow and then photographed floating away on a white background by Jamie Chung. The project was turned around in the space of a week with Chow being commissioned on the same day that the idea was thought up. Rather than making an illustration of a balloon which could be photoshopped, Design Director Gail Bichler and her team decided to manufacture an actual balloon which could be inflated, so 25 were produced in order for them to be photographed in different ways. The cover was well received with it gaining 71% of votes in Adweek's weekly magazine 'Cover Battle' although in an interview with GQ Magazine Trump referred to the cover as \\"ridiculous\\". The following year the cover went on to win a gold medal from The Society for News Design in their annual awards, in the '12C Magazines, Cover Design' category with judges describing the illustration as \\"Playful, fun, timely, tells a story, also timeless\\". Exhibitions In June 2014, Chow launched his first UK solo retrospective which was held at the Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art in Manchester's Northern Quarter. Chow reflected on his upbringing in a chip shop by turning the window of the arts centre into a takeaway shop front. At the end of the exhibition all the works were sold on a first-come, first-served basis at takeaway prices with buyers being able to remove the art from the walls and take it home immediately. All proceeds went to the CFCCA artistic programme. In early 2016, Chow announced plans to return to the Centre for Chinese Contemporary Art for a follow up exhibition which would take place for six months from February as part of the centre's 30th anniversary celebrations. The new exhibition, entitled InStangram would follow on from Chow's previous Takeaway exhibition by presenting 30 new designs featuring food, locations and objects inspired by Chow's experiences of growing up as an English-born Chinese man in Manchester.

He developed the Barmac crusher with fellow engineer Jim Macdonald. Early life and family Born in the Auckland suburb of Epsom in 1928, Bartley was the second son of Wilma Amy (n√©e Slattery) and George Frederick Bartley, a pharmacist. He studied civil engineering at Auckland University College, graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering in 1950 or 1953. Career Bartley was employed by Winstone Aggregates and in the 1960s was instrumental in that company purchasing what is now its main quarry, Hunua Quarry near Papakura. He was one of the founders of the New Zealand branch of the Institute of Quarrying, and in 1989 served as the Institute of Quarrying's first international president. In 1970, Wellington engineer Jim Macdonald built the prototype for a new vertical shaft impactor for creating construction aggregate. Over a period of eight years, Bartley and Macdonald developed the prototype into a viable commercial machine that became known as the Barmac crusher after its two creators. The pair licensed the manufacture of their crusher around the world, and sold the business in 1994. By 2003 over 3500 Barmac crushers had been sold worldwide, the largest rated at 800 kW, and it has been used on projects including the Three Gorges Dam in China. The original Barmac crusher, machine number 1, is preserved at the Kiwi Point Quarry in Ngauranga Gorge, Wellington. Bartley also developed and patented a new self-feathering yacht propeller with John Blundell. In the 2000 New Year Honours, Bartley was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to engineering and the community.

The document was announced on 27 February 2015, by David Cameron, the UK Prime Minister and Nick Clegg, the UK Deputy Prime Minister at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales. The term 'St David's Day Agreement' was controversial in Wales since it gave the impression that it was an agreement between governments or parties to a negotiation akin to the Good Friday Agreement, when in fact it was simply a Policy Announcement of the Government in London, not involving the Government in Cardiff. The document's recommendations include: *Energy projects up to 350 Megawatts should be decided by the Welsh Government. This would include most offshore wind farms and renewable technologies to harness tidal power and fracking. *The National Assembly should have powers over the development of ports to improve Wales‚Äôs transport infrastructure. *The National Assembly should have the power to lower the voting age to 16 for Assembly elections. The Assembly already has the power to lower the voting age to 16 for a referendum on devolving income tax powers. *All powers relating to National Assembly and local government elections should be devolved. This includes deciding the electoral system, the number of constituencies, their boundaries, the timing of elections and the conduct of the elections themselves. *The Welsh Government should have the power to appoint one member of the Ofcom board to represent Welsh interests. *A review should be carried out of Air Passenger Duty which could open the door for it to be devolved to Wales. *The agreement says the Welsh Government should be able to set its own speed limits and transport regulation for ports, taxis and buses.

Kabiri is fluent in Tajik, Persian, Arabic, Russian, and English. Early Life and Career Kabiri was born in the Faizobod District of Tajikistan into a devout Muslim family. During the country's civil war in 1992‚Äì1997, Kabiri lived in Russia and had a business there. Upon returning to Dushanbe in 1997, he became a close ally of Said Abdullo Nuri, the leader of the IRPT, becoming deputy chairman of the party in 2000. In 2005, he was elected to the parliament of Tajikistan through an IRPT party list. Kabiri effectively led the IRPT since 2004 when Said Abdullo Nuri was diagnosed with cancer. Despite the resistance of many conservative members of the party, Nuri recommended Kabiri as his replacement, and Kabiri was elected the chairman of IRPT following Nuri's death in August 2006. Kabiri is credited with repairing ideological divisions within the party, strengthening it, and sidelining the more conservative and radical members of the party. In October 2011, he was reelected as chairman of the party. After the IRPT gathered only 1,5% votes, and no seats in Parliament for first time in 15 years, Kabiri left the country amid widespread speculation that the party would be shut down by authorities. Kabiri's current whereabouts are unknown, although he is rumored to be in Turkey. The 50-year-old was last seen publicly at an international conference in Iran, where he attended the International Conference of Islamic Unity on December 27 and was seated next to the head of Tajikistan's state-backed Council of Islamic Ulema and other members of the official delegation from Tajikistan. Kabiri's colleagues have urged him not to return to Tajikistan from abroad, saying it was not safe and citing the mysterious assassination of another opposition leader, fugitive tycoon and opposition Group 24 founder Umarali Quvvatov, in Istanbul in March. On August 2015, the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan was banned by the Tajik Justice Ministry.

He was a faculty member at Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1991‚Äì99 and held postdoctoral positions at Harvard University and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research. Mathur's research is focused on string theory, black holes, the AdS/CFT correspondence, and cosmology. He is best known for developing the Fuzzball conjecture as a resolution of the black hole information paradox. The Fuzzball conjecture asserts that the fundamental description of black holes is given by a quantum bound state of matter which has the same size as the corresponding classical black hole. This quantum bound state replaces the event horizon and singularity, and the classical black hole metric is claimed to be an approximate effective description. In 2009 Mathur published a strong version of the black hole information paradox, strengthening Stephen Hawking's original version by demonstrating that small local corrections to Hawking's semiclassical analysis cannot restore unitarity. This result was obtained by applying Strong Subadditivity of Quantum Entropy to the evaporation of Hawking radiation. This led to a renewed interest in the information paradox and the development of the 2012 black hole firewall paradox.Jennifer Ouellette, \\"The Fuzzball Fix for a Black Hole Paradox\\", Quanta magazine, June 23, 2015. https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150623-fuzzballs-black-hole-firewalls References External links * Mathur's web page at The Ohio State University * List of Publications on INSPIRE-HEP * Information paradox solved?

(It offers five Masses each weekday, in the morning at 7:45 and 8:30 and at 12:05 and 1:05 and 5:15 p.m. to serving the numerous shoppers and workers in the dense Center City area, which has over 200,000 workers.) At one time, in an effort to serve a special population, it even had a Mass at 2:45 a.m. on Sundays for workers leaving their businesses at that time, called the \\"Printers' Mass,\\" because of the many newspaper printing plants nearby. It is also one of the few local parishes to offer confession on multiple days during the week, usually from 3:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays and on the vigil days for weekday holydays. This extensive sacramental schedule is offered even though the current number of homes registered in the parish is only 821 (due to the largely commercial nature of the surrounding area). Current status of parish 250px It is staffed by the Franciscan Capuchin order of priests (which began running the parish in 1991), but for most of its history was served by secular priests from the Philadelphia diocese and archdiocese. The pastor is Father John Daya. In addition to the daily Masses listed above, the Sunday schedule is 8:30 a.m., 10:30 a.m., 12:30 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. (along with a Saturday evening Vigil Mass at 5:15 p.m.). Unlike the daily Masses, which are in the lower church, all the Sunday Masses are in the upper church. The weekly church bulletin (with special schedules and listings of other events) is online. Early history 250px The charter for the parish was granted on December 27, 1830, the feast of St. John the Evangelist, by the Bishop, Francis P. Kenrick, to the Rev. John Hughes, although the location for the church was not chosen until the following year. The church finally was consecrated on Passion Sunday (April 8) in 1832. The interior of the church, at the time (it was since damaged twice by fire), included a fresco painted by Nicholas Monachesi, who became renowned as a local portrait painter and, in 1834, the United States premiere of Mozart's Requiem Mass was held at the church. It was later that year, on August 1, that the first fire on the block occurred. Early 19th Century: designation as Cathedral and Nativist Riots In 1838, the church was designated as Philadelphia's Proto-Cathedral and the bishop took up residence in the rectory. [The previous cathedral, from 1810 to 1838, was Old St. Mary's Church at 4th and Locust Streets.] In 1844 the Nativist Riots, in which several dozen people were killed, broke out. After two Catholic churches (St. Michael's and St. Augustine's) were destroyed, General George Cadwalader placed cannon near the cathedral to protect it and the disturbances did not damage the church. Later 19th Century: connection with future saints In the 1850s, two future saints were connected with the parish; Katherine Drexel received first communion and was confirmed at the parish while John Neumann, Bishop Kenrick's replacement when he was named Archbishop of Baltimore, arrived to become bishop on March 30, 1852; as bishop he lived in the parish (then the cathedral) rectory. At this time (1855‚Äì1860), the Jesuit order took over administration of the parish when the pastor entered the Jesuit order. In 1864, the current cathedral, the Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul on Logan Circle, was named the diocesan cathedral and St. John's again became an ordinary parish. During St. John's time as cathedral, Philadelphia had 170,000 Catholics. Fire of 1899 In February, 1899, the church was burned in a fire which destroyed much of the block where it was located, and there was also damage to the rectory. Three firemen died when the building collapsed atop them and a fourth died later of pneumonia, contracted while battling the blaze in the February weather. A Mass to pray for them was held later that month in the Academy of Music, since the upper church was unusable. In recent years, an annual Mass for this purpose is held each year. Later in 1899, the parish school was moved out of the basement area of the church which was converted to a lower church for the celebration of the Sacraments while the main (upper church) was repaired. Ties with Mexico The original pastor, Fr. Hughes, became close friends with a parishioner who had lived in Mexico for several years and, through him, ties with that country and people from it endured for many years. Not only was there financial support from Mexican merchants living in Philadelphia, but, when Mexican Emperor Augustin de Iturbide, was executed by Santa Ana in 1824, his family moved to Philadelphia and his widow, Ana Maria Huarte de Iturbide, is buried in St. John's Churchyard Cemetery, along with some other members of her family. During the anti-religious persecution in the 1920s, the Sisters of the Visitation were expelled from Mexico and lived on the church property at St. John's for several years, before moving to their current monastery site. Other missions In 1939, Bishop Yu Pin urged the Chinese community to connect with the parish; ultimately hundreds did and a chapel (later renamed Holy Redeemer Church) was opened about six blocks away from the main church in the heart of Chinatown, where it still operates.
