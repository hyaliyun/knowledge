Located on the south side of Place el-Hedim (el-Hedim Square) in the old city, it was originally the main ceremonial entrance to the Kasbah (royal citadel) of Sultan Moulay Isma'il, built in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Today it is one of the most famous and admired landmarks in the city.  History  Moulay Abd ar-Rahman's 19th-century loggia visible in the back Begun in the later years of Moulay Isma'il's reign, the gate was finished in 1732 by his son Moulay Abdallah. The gate's purpose was more ceremonial than defensive, aiming to impress visitors. Its name comes from the architect and designer of the gate, Mansour al-'Alj (the \\"Victorious Apostate\\"), a former Christian slave who converted to Islam. Another ornate gate, Bab Jama' en-Nouar, also stands a short distance to the southwest along the same wall. It has similar decoration to the larger Bab Mansour and is believed to also date from the time of Moulay Isma'il. In the early 19th century, Sultan Moulay Abd ar-Rahman added a loggia-type structure just outside the gate on the right (southwest side), which is no longer present today. The structure served as a meeting place for military and high officials, as the tribunal of the city's governor, and to hold other military or religious ceremonies. Today the gate is usually closed but its interior is sometimes open to host exhibits.  Architecture  The overall design of the gate is based on Almohad prototypes (such as Bab Agnaou and the gate of the Kasbah of the Udayas), with a large horseshoe-arch opening and flanking bastions, but also presents significant new features. In particular, the flanking square bastions or towers are supported on four thick squat columns at the corners with horseshoe arches between them, creating a hollow loggia at the base of the towers. Further out to the sides, flanking the bastions, are massive marble columns supporting large projecting pilasters above. The columns, with ornate composite order capitals, are of ancient Roman origin, probably from the nearby site of Volubilis. Almost the entire facade of the gate, including the flanking bastions, is covered in heavy decoration. This consists of a repeating darj-wa-ktaf motif (stylized lozenge-like pattern in Moroccan architecture) which frames the main archway of the gate and fills the spaces above the columns of the flanking bastions. The empty or negative spaces within this motif are entirely filled with colourful polychrome zellij (mosaic tilework), another feature which was new to Moroccan monumental gateways. The spandrels of the arches are filled with arabesque-painted tiles. At the very top of the gate, above the other decoration and running along its entire length, is an elaborate Arabic inscription painted on tiles which describes the construction of the gate, which in turn was topped by small \\"saw-tooth\\" merlons. Inside, the gate's passage is bent, turning 90 degrees twice, and bridges the distance between the double walls of the Kasbah, granting access to Place Lalla Aouda beyond.

The first appointment was ruled invalid by a federal judge in March 2020; the second was found invalid by GAO in August 2020. Beginning in 2019, multiple appointments of acting officials in the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had their legality questioned, on the basis of whether the appointments were legal under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 and the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The disputed appointments were those of Kevin McAleenan and Chad Wolf as Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, and Ken Cuccinelli as Senior Official Performing the Duties of both the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security and the Director of United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). The dispute on the Secretary and Deputy Secretary appointments centered on the fact that the issued text of an amendment to the order of succession deviated from the intention of then-Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, placing a different person than expected next in line. The dispute on the USCIS appointment centered on whether a newly created Principal Deputy Director position was validly the \\"first assistant\\" to the Director under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. On March 1, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Cuccinelli was not lawfully appointed to serve as acting USCIS Director and invalidated certain actions taken by him; the government dropped its appeal of this case in August 2020. On August 14, 2020, the Government Accountability Office released a finding that McAleenan, Wolf, and Cuccinelli had been appointed improperly to their Acting Secretary and Deputy Secretary positions; the DHS rejected this finding.  Background  The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA) specified procedures for filling vacant offices, allowing the President to direct a person serving in a different Senate-confirmed position to serve as acting officer. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA) established the Department of Homeland Security and the position of the Secretary of Homeland Security. The line of succession to the Secretary was specified through a series of executive orders, the most recent of which was Executive Order 13753 of December 9, 2016, which specified the line of succession when the Secretary had \\"died, resigned, or otherwise become unable to perform the functions and duties of the office of Secretary\\". The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, signed into law on December 23, 2016, amended the HSA to create new procedures for specifying the line of succession for the Secretary as an exception to the procedures in the FVRA. Specifically, it specified that the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Management must be third in line to the Secretary position, and second in line to the Deputy Secretary position. It also allowed the Secretary rather than the President to specify the further lines of succession, and did not specify a time limit to the eligibility of acting officials as the FVRA had done. The Secretary specified succession through DHS Delegation 00106, which went through a number of revisions. By February 2019, it stated that Executive Order 13753 still held in the case of death, resignation, or inability; and provided an \\"Annex A\\" specifying the succession if the Secretary became \\"unavailable to act during a disaster or catastrophic emergency\\", although the order of succession was the same in both cases.  Disputed appointments = McAleenan and Wolf as Acting Secretary  Kirstjen Nielsen served as the Senate-confirmed Secretary of Homeland Security from December 5, 2017 until April 10, 2019. On April 9, 2019, Nielsen had issued a new revision of Delegation 00106 that updated Annex A, but left Executive Order 13753 in place in the case of death, resignation, or inability. At the time, DHS referred to Annex A, which had Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan as next in line, rather than Executive Order 13753, which had Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Director Christopher C. Krebs as next in line. While Nielsen demonstrably intended to place McAleenan next in line, and a memorandum from the DHS General Counsel to Nielsen contained ambiguous language, the actual issued text of the amended Delegation 00106 unambiguously placed Krebs next in line. McAleenan served as Acting Secretary, at least in a de facto capacity, from April 11 until November 13, 2019. On November 8, 2019, McAleenan issued another revision of Delegation 00106, which specified Annex A as the line of succession for all situations, and placed the Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans fourth in line for the Secretary position. Upon McAleenan's resignation, Chad Wolf began serving de facto as Acting Secretary on November 13, 2019.  Cuccinelli as Acting USCIS Director and Deputy Secretary  Ken Cuccinelli was appointed to serve in the newly created position of Principal Deputy Director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) in June 2019. This was intended to make him the \\"first assistant\\" to the Director position, making him eligible to immediately become its Acting Director. On November 13, 2019, the day he assumed office, Wolf amended Annex B of Delegation 00106 specifying the order of succession for Deputy Secretary, placing the Principal Deputy Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services second in line after the Under Secretary for Management, thus specifying Cuccinelli as Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Deputy Secretary.  Controversy = USCIS appointment  In a June 18, 2019 letter to the Acting Secretary of Homeland Security, House committee chairs Jerry Nadler, Elijah Cummings, and Bennie Thompson alleged that Cuccinelli's brief appointment as Principal Deputy Director had been retroactively applied, possibly in violation of the FVRA. The USCIS employees union also challenged the legality of Cuccinelli's appointment. In September 2019, a lawsuit was filed challenging his asylum directives, partially on the basis that his appointment was invalid. On March 1, 2020, Judge Randolph D. Moss of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that Cuccinelli was not lawfully appointed to serve as acting director, on the basis that the novel nature of the Principal Deputy Director position meant that he had never served as the \\"first assistant\\" to anyone. He therefore lacked authority to issue two of the directives challenged in the lawsuit. Because the case was not filed as a class action, Moss was \\"unconvinced\\" that his relief should be extended to other asylum seekers not part of the original suit. On August 12, 2020, the government dropped its appeal in the case.  Secretary and Deputy Secretary appointments  Kevin McAleenan being sworn in as DHS Acting Secretary by Kirstjen Nielsen in April 2019. DHS used this photograph to argue that Nielsen had intended to and had legally placed McAleenan next in line to become Acting Secretary, validating the later appointments of Wolf and Cuccinelli. On November 15, 2019, House Democrats Bennie Thompson and Carolyn Maloney requested that Comptroller General of the United States Gene Dodaro review the legality of Wolf's appointment on the basis that former Acting Secretary McAleenan did not have authority to change the department's line of succession, asserting that former Secretary Nielsen had not properly placed McAleenan first in the line of succession before resigning and that McAleenan's change came after the 210-day limit to his authority had expired. On August 14, 2020, the Government Accountability Office released a finding that McAleenan, Wolf, and Cuccinelli had been appointed improperly, noting that: > Upon Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen's resignation on April 10, 2019, the > official who assumed the title of Acting Secretary had not been designated > in the order of succession to serve upon the Secretary's resignation. > Because the incorrect official assumed the title of Acting Secretary at that > time, subsequent amendments to the order of succession made by that official > were invalid and officials who assumed their positions under such > amendments, including Chad Wolf and Kenneth Cuccinelli, were named by > reference to an invalid order of succession. Dodaro referred the matter to Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Joseph V. Cuffari to review the questions of who should be serving in these positions, the legality of other actions taken by McAleenan, Wolf, and Cuccinelli. Under the line of succession found valid by GAO, the Acting Secretary as of August 2020 would be Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Pete Gaynor. Although GAO findings are not legally binding, it was expected to affect several pending court cases, including Wolf v. Vidal, where plaintiffs had argued that rules issued by McAleenan, Wolf, and Cuccinelli were void because they had been improperly appointed. On August 17, the Department of Homeland Security's Acting General Counsel issued a statement rejecting the GAO's finding, saying that Nielsen had in fact legally appointed McAleenan as Acting Secretary. To support this they stated the fact that she had personally sworn him in, and announced in a public email that he was the incoming Acting Secretary, as evidence of her intention. They also pointed to a preliminary memorandum from the DHS General Counsel to Nielsen that, unlike the text of the actual DHS Delegation, included ambiguous language. They also criticized the timing of the finding, noting that GAO had taken over eight months to issue the finding, and released in just 80 days prior to the 2020 United States elections, and asserted that the validity of the appointment was outside the GAO's jurisdiction because it was made under the HSA and not the FVRA. On August 21, GAO declined to retract or amend their findings, saying that DHS had not provided any evidence of material errors of fact or law in the finding, and that all their points had already been considered in the finding. On August 25, President Trump announced that he would nominate Wolf to be confirmed by the Senate as the permanent Secretary of Homeland Security.

Osterburg mines persistent images in his (and collective) memory, which he recreates in quick, intuitively built models devoid of people, stripped of superfluous detail, and made with humble, found materials: toothpicks, twigs, vegetables, glass doorknobs, broken umbrellas, books, refuse. He places the unpeopled models in carefully selected, sometimes far-flung settings (beaches, lakes or rivers, cities), then photographs them through a magnifying glass or macro lens so they appear life-size from a human vantage point, drawing viewers in as lone spectators.Spear, Peggy. \\"Ship Shape,\\" Diablo Arts Journal, January-March 2001.Beeler, Monique. \\"Prints charming at Kala Institute,\\" The Oakland Tribune, February 16, 2001.Tindall, Blair. \\"Set sail for Bedford Gallery's 'Adrift' exhibit,\\" The Sunday Times, January 28, 2001, p.

Over the next decade, he began fleshing out incomplete but skillfully constructed miniatures out of found materials, which he staged, photographed, and printed as black-and-white photogravures. His earlier photogravures combine drama, whimsy and the mythic, depicting sea vessels in various states (Fram, 1997; Cargo Ship in Storm, 2002; Safe Harbor and Wreck of the Somerset, 2004), rickety, rustic structures (Thorn Boat Marina, 1998; Vietnamese Waterwheel, 2001), and interiors carved from bits of soap (Soap Library, 2001).Lynch, Kevin. \\"Visions of energy and hope,\\" The Capital Times, May 9, 2002. Reviews describe these images as beyond documentary or appropriated photography, baffling in their mix of mute, rough-hewn forms, deceptive composing and real settings, whose effects of mist, morning dew, fog, even wind, are captured by photogravure's infinite tonality.

Others portray vaguely convincing maritime dramas, as in Shackleton (2000) or Flat Earth (2006), which depicts a boat heading into a waterfall at the end of the world. After turning to new imagery for a decade, Osterburg returned to the sea in the show \\"Waterline\\" (2018), referencing rising seas, historic floods and geologic change through photogravures of imperiled boats and an installation of boat models, hung hip-high along an imaginary waterline.Wall Street Art. \\"Lothar Osterburg,\\" November 20, 2018. In the early 2000s, Osterburg also explored images of flight (Zeppelin over Timbuktu, 2003; Channel Crossing with Hot Air Balloon, 2005). Art Newspaper critic Sarah Douglas noted such works for the \\"humble strangeness\\" of their construction and dust-marked, scratched surfaces, which she compared to silent film stills or the \\"delightfully eerie\\" films of the Brothers Quay. Osterburg's flight interests culminated in images of ancient-yet-futuristic vessels and spacecraft hovering over shadowy shanty and shack cities in his show, \\"Strangely Familiar\\" (2006, Highpoint Center), and his series of planets populated by gigantically scaled boats, bridges and condominiums (e.g., Babylon, 2008), which were inspired by Antoine de Saint- Exup√©ry's The Little Prince.Plasse, Sabina Dana. \\"Take adventure in art at Ochi,\\" Idaho Mountain Express, July 1, 2009.

Reviews compare the work to the mise en sc√®ne of early silent films, such as F. W. Murnau's Nosferatu, which conveyed passages of gothic narrative in their detail and expressiveness.

In 1951, Ignatius Musaazi rented part of the ground floor of Musajjalumbwa's house, a house of the late Yakobo Musajjalumbwa, who was a Treasurer (Omuwanika) in the Buganda Kingdom. At this house, a lot of work was done which resulted in the creation of the UNC.

Abu Mayanja and John Kale established a UNC office in Cairo to link up with contacts all over the world in order to assist freedom fighters in Africa. The Secretary General of the UNC, Abu Mayanja, used his close relationship with the then Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung and Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, to secure support for African freedom fighters involved in the struggle for independence in Africa. The UNC received ¬£500,000 from China, as well as a modern printing press for the UNC from Italy. The printing press was installed in offices of two Ugandan newspapers at the time, namely The Uganda Post and The Uganda Express, which were based at Kololo in Kampala.  Other political parties formed in Uganda Following the birth of the UNC, other political parties were formed. In 1956, DP (Democratic Party) was formed. In March 1960, UPC - Uganda People's Congress party was formed. After the 1958 general election in Uganda, seven unaffiliated members of the Uganda Legislative Council (which was in effect Parliament in those colonial days), formed the Uganda People's Union.  Split in the UNC In 1960 there was a split in the UNC party: there was a Musaazi faction and an Apollo Milton Obote-led faction. The Uganda People's Union together with the Obote-led faction of the UNC, got together and formed a new party, the Uganda People's Congress (UPC) in March 1960. The DP and UPC parties became major political parties in Uganda. The UNC became less of a force, mainly because DP became popular and a new party emerged: Kabaka Yekka party (KY).

The nationwide blackouts occurred due to a transmission technical failure at the Kerawalapitiya Grid-Sub station. The Ceylon Electricity Board announced that the cause of the blackout had not yet been determined, describing it as an unspecified failure. The Ministry of Power stated that a special committee had been appointed to investigate the root cause behind the blackout.  Development  The outage caused disruption in day-to-day activities of the public, including causing traffic congestion in Colombo due to malfunctioning of traffic signals and malfunctioning water supply services. Power was restored to the south of the island relatively early, due to it being powered by the Samanala Dam. Initially, a spokesperson of the Ministry of Power claimed that the outage occurred due to a failure in the Yugadanavi Power Plant. The Minister of Power Dullas Alahapperuma later stated that the outage would be resolved within a space of two hours but the restoration process was delayed for hours due to cascading failures. The power was restored in most parts of the country including Colombo at around 8.30 pm and was regarded as the worst nationwide blackout faced by the country since 2016. The blackout further aggravated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.

Berthelsson served as Captain of the Coastal Fleet (1951‚Äì1953), as Chief of the Naval Staff (1953‚Äì1957), as Chief of the Coastal Fleet (1957‚Äì1961) and as commanding officer of the Naval Command South (1961‚Äì1966). Early life Berthelsson was born on 11 April 1902 in Njurunda Parish, V√§sternorrland County, Sweden, the son of Alfred Berthelsson, a merchant, and his wife Anna Backman. He passed studentexamen in √ñrebro, after which in 1921 he enlisted as a telegraphist in the Swedish Navy, where he reached the rank of Corporal. After two years of service, mostly on the torpedo cruiser HSwMS Claes Horn, Berthelsson was accepted in the summer of 1923 as a naval cadet and underwent regular training at the Royal Swedish Naval Academy. Career Berthelsson was commissioned as a naval officer in 1926 with the rank of F√§nrik. After service as a F√§nrik on the coastal defence ship with G√∂ran Wahlstr√∂m as executive officer and long voyage with the cruiser to South America, Berthelsson began his training as an air scout. During the 1930s, he came during a number of different tours of duty to deal with the air operational issues in the navy, during which he served for a year 1933-34 in the Air Staff. During the same period, he underwent training as a torpedo officer with tours of duty on the destroyers and . These tours were a good preparation for Berthelsson's passing of the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College's General Course in the winter of 1932-33, which was followed by a Staff Course in the winter of 1934-35. This laid the foundation for decades of work in staff service - on board and ashore - as well as in various investigations. In 1936-37 he served on the coastal defence ship Sverige as an adjutant in the Winter Squadron (Vintereskadern) and in 1937 on the cruiser as an adjutant of the School Department. This was followed by service in the Naval Staff, among other things as a press officer until the spring of 1939. The contact with the press that he thereby received, he maintained throughout his subsequent service, which benefited him during work in various investigations. The destroyer Karlskrona, captained by Berthelsson in 1942. In the spring of 1939, Berthelsson took over as flag lieutenant (flaggadjutant) in the Coastal Fleet with Rear Admiral G√∂sta Ehrensv√§rd as commander and Captain Helge Str√∂mb√§ck as Captain of the Fleet (Flaggkapten). During the mobilization in the autumn of 1939 and the subsequent years of emergency preparedness, Berthelsson performed one of his superiors' highly esteemed work. It was above all the development of the ships' tactics and the torpedo's effort, both with ships and aircraft, that he had to devote his strengh to, but at the same time he had to convey to daily press and radio events and developments to keep in touch with the public. Among other things, he also participated in the publication of various defense magazines and books, which were published by various main authors. After three years in this position, Berthelsson got a long-awaited position as ship captain on the destroyer during the summer of 1942, followed by a similar command on the destroyer in 1943. He was largely allowed to conduct escort service in the Baltic Sea for shipping protection against German sea and air forces and Russian submarines, in which he was involved in several incidents. However, in the autumn of 1942, Berthelsson had already taken up the position of teacher in tactics at the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College and in 1943 was appointed Commander 2nd Class. During his three years as a tactics teacher, the reorganization of ship tactics began, which was conditioned by new weapons and on-board radars, which came to strongly influence the ships' way of behaving both at sea and in the bases. His pioneering work also came to fruition in the 1943 naval inquiry into naval warfare, where he served as secretary with Rear Admiral Gunnar Bjurner as leader. The type of ship, the armored destroyer, which was launched at the time, can be said to have served as a model for the Halland-class destroyers who began to be planned and built in the late 1940s and the √ñsterg√∂tland-class destroyers during the 1950s. His diligent efforts to keep the navy with destroyers at sufficient numbers were a marked feature of his business. Berthelsson's good handling of investigative issues led him to be appointed as an expert in the 1945 Defense Committee as an assistant to the then Rear Admiral Stig H:son Ericson, who was the navy's representative. The inquiry's work led to the Defence Act of 1948. Berthelsson as Captain circa 1951-54. Berthelsson's longing for a tour of sea duty was satisfied in the autumn of 1947, when he took over as destroyer division commander with base aboard . This annual command was followed by a year as captain of the cruiser . It was important to design the complex tactics of this newly built ship, which was conditioned by the many weapon systems on board. Tre Kronor was therefore allowed to act fairly independently under the command of the captain, during which Berthelsson was free to develop his thoughts on tactics and personnel care. Berthelsson's theoretical and practical knowledge of naval tactics was then used by placing him in the autumn of 1949 as head of the Weapons Control Office (Stridsledningskontoret) of the Royal Swedish Naval Materiel Administration, where he served for two years, during which time he was appointed Captain in 1951. It was a time when Swedish naval ships was fully equipped with radar, both for reconnaissance, combat command and navigation as well as for weapons deployment in many different forms. Berthelsson's great interest in modern development led him to play a leading role in the introduction of the Decca Navigator System for hyperbole navigation in the southern Baltic Sea. The facilities were later transferred to the Swedish Maritime Administration. In the autumn of 1951, Berthelsson was appointed Captain of the Fleet (Flaggkapten) of the Coastal Fleet, whose commander was Rear Admiral Stig H:son Ericson. This marked the beginning of what was called the \\"cruiser era\\" in the Swedish Navy, which came to be about a decade old. During this time, the \\"squadron tactic\\" was created, which involved a concentrated attack with at least two squadrons, composed of cruisers, destroyers and torpedo boats. In the spring of 1953, Berthelsson took over as Chief of the Naval Staff. The emphasis in his work was shifted from the tactical and operational to the organizational and defense policy. Sweden's cooling defense will and the declining appropriations made it necessary to reduce the ship's armaments, while maintaining the high level of preparedness, leaving the ships to be \\"mothballed\\". At the organizational reductions, Berthelsson preferred to reduce the land organization in order to keep the crews on board, which led to some contradictions. The increasing number of investigations with which the navy was charged during Berthelsson's time as chief meant that his agility, acquired through dealings with publicists and politicians, came in handy. He had the ability, even when there were major differences from the beginning, to negotiate a compromise that was acceptable to all, which, thanks to his determination and willpower, did not become completely unfavorable to the navy. In 1954 he was promoted to rear admiral. In the spring of 1957, he achieved the goal he had set himself since his youth, namely to take over as Chief of the Coastal Fleet. There he had to continue the same line of development, which he helped to draw up during his time as Captain of the Fleet. He was eager to not only lead the exercises from the flagship but also to embark on the smaller ships in difficult conditions at sea to get to know the conditions of the crews. At the same time, he worked for information about the navy during the ships' visits to ports and he never forgot the requirement for contact with the public. However, in 1958 - due to drastically cut defense spending - the destroyers Lappland and V√§rmland had to be canceled to get funds available for the acquisition of the ship types that would be part of the new light fleet, which would succeed the cruiser era. Berthelsson took so much offense to this that he suffered both mentally and physically and his health was forever weakened. In the autumn of 1961, he took over as commanding officer of the Naval Command South (Marinkommando Syd, MKS), based in Kungshuset in Karlskrona, which was his wife, Marianne's home town. However, it did not take long in his new position before he contracted ill health, which meant that from 1963 until his retirement in 1967 he had to devote himself to special assignments. Berthelsson retired and was promoted to vice admiral in 1967. Personal life In 1931, Berthelsson married Marianne Quiding (1905‚Äì1989), the daughter of Uno Quiding, a harbor master, and Thyra Uhrstr√∂m. He was the father of Ulla (born 1933), Ulf (born 1937) and Kang (born 1945). Death Berthelsson died on 11 February 1977 in V√§sterhaninge, Stockholm County. He was interred at V√§sterhaninge Cemetery on 12 March 1977.

History In the early 19th century, most of Cardiff was built on land overlaying gravel beds, which extended to the north and west of the populated area. Residents obtained their water from private and public wells, dug down into the gravel beds. The town was split into two parishes in 1841, St John the Baptist and St Mary, and at that time the population was 10,077. The main public well was in the High Street, although water was also obtained from the River Taff and the Glamorganshire Canal. Industrial development, notably the construction of the West Bute Dock in 1839 and the Taff Vale Railway to connect the dock to the railway system, meant that the population began to increase significantly, and the need to provide a better water supply became urgent. In 1850 a private company obtained the Cardiff Waterworks Act 1850 allowing them to build a water works, with which to supply water to the town, the port, and a number of surrounding villages. The Cardiff Waterworks Company had an authorised capital of ¬£20,000, but soon found that this was not sufficient to complete the works, and so went back to Parliament. They obtained a new Act of Parliament on 14 June 1853, which repealed the first one, and allowed them to raise more capital. They constructed a pumping station at Ely, close to the River Ely, some to the west of the town centre. Water from the river entered a settling pool, and was then filtered before being pumped to a service reservoir at Penhill, Llandaff, to the north of the town, from where a network of pipes allowed it to reach the town and the docks by gravity. Subsequently, the supply was increased by a culvert built along the south side of the river, which collected water from springs and the water bearing strata nearby. Cardiff continued to expand, with the opening of the Rhymney Railway in 1858 and the Bute East Dock the following year, and so the water company obtained a third Act in 1860, allowing them to increase their capital resources and the geographical area which they supplied. Works included a storage reservoir at Lisvane, with a catchment area of , collecting water from the Llanishen, Nant Mawr, Nant Draw, Nant Felin and Nant Dulas. Pipes were laid from the reservoir to intakes on each of the streams, and filter beds were constructed on the outlet from the reservoir. In order to supply Penarth, some to the south-west of the town centre, a low-level service reservoir was built at Cogan, from where pumps raised the water to a distribution reservoir at Llandough, which was sufficiently high to supply Penarth by gravity. Water was supplied to a number of surrounding parishes, the total area of supply being . The company could not take more than (Ml) per day from the River Ely, but that and the Lisvane reservoir remained sufficient until 1878. The reservoir held of water. In 1875, Cardiff Corporation obtained parliamentary approval to buy out the Cardiff Waterworks Company, but failed to reach an agreement with them at the time. The company sought a fourth Act of Parliament in 1878, to enable them to construct additional works at Ely, and a new reservoir at Llanishen to supplement the supply to Cardiff and to extend their area of supply to parts of Llandaff and Whitchurch. The corporation again tried to buy out the company, but still could not reach agreement, so decided to oppose the company's bill, on the basis that the new works would not be adequate for the future requirements of Cardiff. On the day before the bill was due to appear before the House of Commons committee, the company agreed to sell, for a price of ¬£300,000, resulting in the corporation withdrawing their objections. They paid the costs of getting the bill through Parliament, and also redeemed the company's debenture bonds, at a cost of ¬£20,450. Parliamentary approval for the purchase of the company and authority to borrow ¬£470,000 was obtained in 1879. The corporation took possession of the works on 29 September 1879, but the deed confirming the transfer of ownership was not signed until 24 December. The payment of the money was not without drama, as the corporation wanted to use two cheques, one for ¬£165,000 drawn on the National Provincial Bank, and another for ¬£135,000 drawn on the Brecon Old Bank. Two days before the final purchase, the company declined to accept the cheques, despite assurances from the banks that they would be honoured, and so the corporation elected to pay in gold. The company realised the enormous task of counting that much money, and so the banks requested the Bank of England to print two special notes, for the two amounts agreed. On the final day, officers from the corporation collected the note for ¬£165,000 from the National Provincial Bank, but when they got to the Brecon Old Bank, the note had not arrived. They refused to leave the bank even when it closed, and half an hour later, the postman delivered it, enabling the purchase to be completed. Corporation ownership The corporation consulted John Taylor, one of the original directors and promoters of the Cardiff Waterworks Company, who had also been their Engineer, about the works at Ely. In a report produced on 23 September 1880, he recommended that the culverts be extended, and work began on new culverts on the north bank of the river, as a way to quickly increase the volume of water available. In an average year, this increased the resources to per day, and even in the very dry years of 1884 and 1887, the yield was still per day. The cost of the work was ¬£10,614, while the project was managed by John Avery Brandon Williams, who had been Borough Engineer since 14 August 1876, and then became Waterworks Engineer from 11 June 1883. In March 1881, he was asked to produce a report on all possible sources of water for Cardiff, so that planning for the future could begin. He presented his extensive findings in May and August 1881, and suggested that the best scheme would be to utilise the waters of the Taff Fawr, one of the two sources of the River Taff, on the southern slopes of the Brecon Beacons. He also suggested that the capacity of the Llanishen Reservoir, authorised by the Cardiff Waterworks Act of 1878, could be increased from to , without exceeding the limits of deviation specified by the Act. Unable to decide the best way to proceed, they asked the water engineer John Frederick Bateman for advice in December 1881, and in June 1882 he confirmed that the Taff Fawr scheme was the best option. Work began at Llanishen soon afterwards, so that surplus water from the Lisvane catchment would not be lost while the Beacons reservoir scheme was being built. The contract for Llanishen Reservoir was awarded to John Mackey, but it is not clear exactly what this included, since the Corporation awarded a contract for enlargement works soon after Mackey completed his contract in 1884. Hill Brothers began work on this second phase, but pulled out in July, due to financial difficulties, after which T A Walker took over, completing the work in 1886. A bill for the Taff Fawr scheme was submitted to Parliament in November 1883, and a House of Commons Committee considered it between 1 May and 20 May 1884, as there were 16 petitions against it, particularly from riparian landowners. The Corporation called on many of the major water engineers of the day to give evidence, including Bateman, Thomas Hawksley, James Mansergh, and George H. Hill. Their own Engineer, J A B Williams also gave evidence, as did the meteorologist George James Symonds, and although it cost ¬£3,652 to fight their case, it was successful and the Cardiff Corporation Act 1884 received Royal Assent on 7 August. They were empowered to collect water from a catchment of , which was split into an upper and a lower area. Because they had to supply compensation water to maintain the flow in the Taff Fawr, treating the catchment as two separate areas meant that the full amount of compensation water did not have to be provided from the start of the project. The upper area covered and required a compensation flow of per day, under half of the total for the whole catchment. The whole scheme consisted of three storage reservoirs, two in the upper area and one in the lower area, with a combined capacity of , a pipeline, using pipes of and diameter, running from the upper reservoirs to Lisvane and Llanishen, with intermediate balancing reservoirs at Cefn, Blackbrook, and Rhiwbina. There was also a service reservoir and filter beds at Rhiwbina, from which Llandaff, Maindy, Penarth, Penylan and Whitchurch could be supplied by gravity. Work began on the pipeline in October 1885, and was completed in September 1888. Construction of the balancing and service reservoirs began in December 1887 and was completed in November 1888. The first storage reservoir to be built was Cantreff Reservoir No.2, the lowest of the two in the upper area. Construction took rather longer, as work started in the spring of 1886, but was delayed as the Corporation became embroiled in litigation with the first and second contractors employed to carry out the work. Eventually they took control of the task themselves on 13 June 1891, and the reservoir was operational by 14 September 1892, with Williams, their Waterworks Engineer, overseeing the use of direct labour. In order to facilitate the transport of materials to site, of standard gauge railway were built, connecting to the mainline near Cefn-coed-y-cymmer station. Cantreff Reservoir became known as Cantref Reservoir in the 20th century. The 1884 Act stated that Beacons Reservoir, the highest of the three, would have a capacity of but as the details were being worked out, Williams the Waterworks Engineer found that its capacity could be more than doubled by building the dam a little higher up the valley. Geological investigation revealed that the new site would also provide a solid watertight foundation, and so the Corporation went back to Parliament, and the Cardiff Corporation Act 1894 authorised the change. Work had started in April 1893, and in view of the experience with contractors on Cantref, they decided to complete the entire project using direct labour. The Board of Trade had sanctioned an extension of the railway from Cantref to the Beacons Reservoir site on 27 April 1893, and by June the new track had been laid, creating a railway that was long. By the autumn, a network of sidings and tracks had been completed, as had offices, a blacksmith's shop, a boiler house, workshops for carpenters, a fitting shop, a shed for the locomotives, a sawmill, some stables and a wagon shop. Much of the village was built using buildings which had previously been used on the Cantref project, and it included accommodation for 335 men, with housing for an additional 85 remaining at Cantref. While the embankment with its clay core were being built, the corporation employed around 500 men, with some extracting stone from a quarry near Cefn Coed, others working at the Crawshay Brothers' clay pit excavating the puddle clay, and a number working on the railway, besides those working on the dam. February 1896 was a record month, when some 4,100 tons of clay were removed from the clay pit and transported to the dam. This traffic ceased at Christmas 1896, and completion of the details took place in the spring and summer of 1897. Impounding of the Taff Fawr began on 17 September, with a formal opening ceremony held on 30 September 1897. The capacity of the enlarged reservoir was . New personnel On 24 June 1895, the Waterworks Engineer, J A B Williams, had resigned, to be replaced by Charles Henry Priestley. One of the last tasks that Williams completed was to produce plans showing the reservoirs and all the land owned by the Corporation. Priestley oversaw the latter stages of construction at Beacons Reservoir, and a number of smaller projects, including a water tower and high- level service reservoir at Penylan, to allow the population of Rhymney, St Mellons and Penylan to benefit from a proper water supply, the construction of three more filter beds at Heath, and the expansion of the pipework within the town. The Heath site, close to the Rhymney Railway, already contained a service reservoir and three filter beds. Thomas D Ridley of Cardiff and Middlesbrough was awarded a contract worth ¬£10,115 for three more filter beds, and to facilitate the transport of materials to the site, a siding was constructed from the Rhymney Railway. Work began on 5 April 1897, with sand and gravel for the filters coming from Bideford in Devon by ship to Cardiff, and then by rail into the site. Spoil was removed by rail and taken to Cardiff Docks, where a new embankment was being constructed. Ridley had completed the project by 1 March 1898, but soon afterwards was awarded a second contract, to construct two more filters and a second service reservoir, which he completed by the end of 1898. In order to enable the sand and gravel to be changed, a Decauville portable railway was installed, but no further details are known. The Corporation's area of supply was extended to include St Fagans in 1902, and money was borrowed to fund a new service reservoir at Leckwith and extensions to the works at Rhiwbina, Cogan, and Heath. A bypass was constructed near Llanishen viaduct, to enable water from the Taff Fawr pipeline to be routed directly to the filter beds at Heath, and a second supply for sanitary purposes was laid into the town. Consideration was given to increasing the size of the Llwyn-on Reservoir so that it could supply the compensation water for the whole catchment, per day. When the plans were eventually deposited before Parliament, the reservoir was bigger again, with a capacity of . Louis P Nott was awarded a contract for construction in November 1910, at a price of ¬£201,077. The project was expected to take six years from January 1911, but due to the onset of the First World War, HM Treasury ordered that work should cease in 1915. Nott was not happy with the settlement, and began litigation. Although he died in 1916, his cause was taken up by the engineer Robert Brodie, and after an appeal against the outcome of arbitration by the corporation, the House of Lords eventually ruled in favour of Nott. When the war ended, the contract was terminated, and the corporation finished building the reservoir using direct labour, with Priestley overseeing the work, H W B Cotterill acting as resident engineer and manager, and George Wainfer acting as site foreman. Impounding of water began on 23 June 1926, initiated by the Lord Mayor, W P Francis, and by November the reservoir was full, although commissioning did not take place until May 1927. In 1922, the corporation began building new filters and a filter house at the foot of the Cantref dam. Nott, as part of the Llwyn-on contract, had rebuilt the railway from Cefn to Llwyn-on in 1911, and it was extended up to Cantref before construction of the filters began. The railway took a new route in the vicinity of Llwyn-on, climbing to higher ground on the west side of the reservoir, but rejoined the historic route at the northern end of the reservoir. A total of eleven steam locomotives ran on the railway, six owned by Nott, and six during the corporation phase of the build, one of which was obtained from Nott's executors. The filters were put into service on 23 June 1926, shortly after Priestley had retired in April, aged 72, and the railway above Llwyn-on was also lifted in April 1926. The rest of the railway was probably lifted in 1928, and one of the locomotives, Abernant, made by Manning Wardle in 1921, has survived and was awaiting restoration at the Great Central Railway (Nottingham) in 2012. In June 1920 work started on a service reservoir at Wenallt, a little to the north of Llanishen Reservoir. It was designed to hold of water, and was surrounded by concrete walls. Initially, the corporation used direct labour, and they constructed a small railway from the reservoir site to the bottom of the field, which was operational by November 1920. In late 1922, a siding was constructed at Whitchurch station, about away. and an aerial ropeway was used to move materials to the site. Work stopped in March 1924, and in October Hybart, Broadhead & Company won a contract to continue construction. They used the aerial ropeway and the onsite railway to make progress, but subsidence occurred, and their contract was terminated on 31 March 1926. The corporation employed Francois Cementation Company to make borings and carry out remedial work in 1926-1927 and finished the construction using direct labour. The reservoir was half-filled in November 1927, and fully filled in February 1928. At some point, a roof was fitted to cover the reservoir, plans for which were drawn up in 1939, in order to protect the water supply during the war. Two 0-4-0 Wren class saddle tanks are known to have worked at the site, both manufactured by Kerr, Stuart and Company. No.3114 dating from 1918 was bought second hand from the Ministry of Munitions and subsequently worked on the Lake Vyrnwy pipeline contract for Liverpool Corporation Waterworks. Between 1932 and 1937, it was used on the construction of Fernilee Reservoir for Stockport Corporation, and is now preserved as part of the historic locomotive collection at the Vale of Rheidol Railway. Kerr Stuart No.4161 was bought new in 1921 and was moved to Llanishen Reservoir in 1929, where a -gauge railway was used as part of a project to dredge the reservoir in 1929-1930. Afterwards, the locomotive was sold, and worked at a quarry near Newton Abbot for many years. Photographs taken at Wenallt in 1926 also show a small wing tank locomotive with a cab, but no further details are known. In the mid-20th century, Heath filters were decommissioned, to be replaced by a treatment works at Rhiwbina. In the 1960s, the Corporation built Llandegfedd Reservoir. It was designed to hold , and is located in the valley of the S√¥r Brook near Pontypool and the Royal Ordnance Factory at Glascoed. The dam consists of an earth embankment, with a core of rolled clay, and it is filled by water pumped from an intake on the River Usk at Prioress Mill, Rhadyr. It was opened in two stages in spring 1964 and spring 1965. Unlike previous reservoirs, the water was not used exclusively by Cardiff Corporation, but was split between five undertakings. Cardiff were allocated per day, Newport and South Monmouthshire Water Board per day, and Abertillery & District Water Board and Pontypool & District Water Company were allocated per day each. per year was also supplied to the Spencer Steel Works at Llanwern. Water from the reservoir was treated by the treatment works at Sluvad and flowed to Cardiff by gravity. Most of the Cardiff Corporation Waterworks major structures were grade II listed in the 21st century, Cantref Reservoir and dam in June 2002, the masonry structures at Beacons Reservoir in June 2005, the water filtration plant at Cantref in July 2005, and the reservoirs and dams at Beacons and Llanishen in July 2009. Sewage disposal Faced with the fact that many towns suffered from outbreaks of typhus and cholera, the social reformer Edwin Chadwick had produced his report The Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Classes in Britain in 1842. He was convinced that there was a link between insanitary conditions and poor health, leading to short life expectancy. He argued that a good, constant supply of water was necessary to improve conditions and that proper drainage was just as important. His report caught the public imagination, and in 1847, Lord Morpeth, an ally of Chadwick, introduced a bill into Parliament that would have required local authorities to ensure that all houses in towns had a proper water supply, and a drainage system to take away waste. By the time it became the Public Health Act 1848, many of the important points had been removed, but it did establish a Board of Health. Towns and districts could request an inspection from the Board of Health, which then gave them powers which would otherwise have required a local Act of Parliament, which was a costly process. Where there was support for it, a local board was formed to implement sanitary reforms. In 1848/49 there was a serious outbreak of the water-borne disease cholera, with some 3,000 deaths reported in Glamorganshire, of which over 350 occurred in Cardiff. Cardiff was one of the early towns in Glamorgan to have a local board of health. As required by the Act, one-tenth of the ratepayers had to request the Board of Health to carry out an inspection, which was performed by Thomas Webster Rammell. After the enquiry, the borough council became the local board of health for Cardiff in September 1850, although separate meetings were held to consider board of health issues until 1875, when they became part of the main business of the council. Henry James Paine, Cardiff's Officer of Health, reported 15 deaths from cholera in August 1854, although he thought the source might have been foreign ships, since six of the casualties were seamen, and the rest were closely associated with them. If the late 1850s, the civil engineer Thomas Waring was the engineer responsible for constructing Cardiff's network of sewers, a task in which he was assisted for 18 months during 1856 and 1857 by Alfred Mountain Fowler, who went on to become president of the Association of Municipal and County Engineers. Between 1848 and 1872, nearly ¬£100,000 was spent on improving the drainage and water supply systems in the town. The sewers converged to the east of Roath Dock, where there was a small indentation in the coastline, and the untreated effluent was discharged directly into the sea.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1901 This remained the practice until the 1980s, when the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was formed in 1987. One of the first tasks was to clean up the polluted waters of Cardiff Bay, caused not only by sewage, but also by coal dust and industrial waste. A project costing ¬£14 million began to divert the sewers that discharged into the bay. Welsh Water built a new sewage treatment works on reclaimed land just to the east of the original outfall at Tremorfa, costing ¬£118 million. The final piece in the jigsaw was the construction of Cardiff Bay Barrage, creating a freshwater lake where there had once been tidal mudflats. Environmental opposition was mitigated by creating a large reserve for wild birds a little further to the east, and strict environmental standards, including oxygenating of the water using compressed air, have created a space which is clean enough to support trout and salmon. The population of west Cardiff, Dinas Powys, Sully, Penarth and Barry are served by another new sewage treatment works. Cog Moors opened in 1990, from which treated effluent is discharged by a long sea outfall at Lavernock Point. In 2020 it was undergoing a ¬£50 million upgrade to create an advanced anaerobic digestion plant, which will generate over 2MWh of electricity per year, using two engines powered by the biogas produced as the sewage sludge is digested. Governance The Water Act 1973 replaced the 27 river authorities of England and Wales with ten regional water authorities, which took over the land drainage, fishery and river management responsibilities of the River Authorities, and also became responsible for the provision of water supply and sewage treatment, which was removed from local authority control. Cardiff Corporation Waterworks ceased to exist from 1 April 1974, and its assets passed to the Welsh National Water Development Authority, subsequently becoming the Welsh Water Authority. Further change occurred in 1989, when the water supply and sewerage functions were privatised by the Water Act 1989, while the land drainage, fishery and river management responsibilities passsed to the National Rivers Authority. Consequently water supply and sewerage in Cardiff was taken over by Dwr Cymru Welsh Water.

He was the father of painter Wilhelm Marstrand. Early life and education Marstrand was born on 5 August 1776 in √òsterdalen, Norway, the son of manager (bergskriver) of Inset Copperworks Even Nicolai Marstrand (1723‚Äì85) and Magdalene Elisabeth Schnitler (1730‚Äì1802). The family moved to Trondheim when his father died in 1785. He graduated from Trondheim Cathedral School in 1789. Career Aged 20, Marstrand came to Denmark, where he initially worked odd jobs, for instance as a private tutor and a road assistant, before being employed as an assistant under colonel Eilert Tscherning at Frederick's Works. He was later promoted to mechanical consultant to the government, settling in Copenhagen in 1806. He was the following year sent to England but when the war broke out shortly thereafter he came under suspicion of being a spy and had to flee the country. Back in Copenhagen, he was granted a royal privilege as a baker after inventing a kneading machine, opening a bakery in Silkegade in 1810. He also established a mechanical workshop, constructing spinning machines and various musical instruments, especially harps. He invented an oil press in 1812 and in 1913 was granted a monopoly on a horse mill. In 1827, he invented a machine for copying of sculptures. Marstrand was from 1808 also inspector of the workshops at the Royal Institute for the Deaf and Mute. In 1813, he was appointed as manager of the workshops at Forbedringshuset.

Career  Walsh served with in the Royal Australian Air Force during World War II, then commenced medical studies in 1946. In the first year of his medical training, he became interested in psychology and enrolled in the University of Melbourne‚Äôs newly established Department of Psychology. After completing his medical studies, Walsh became interested in abnormal behaviour, and during his tenure as a Neuropsychiatric Medical Officer at the Mont Park Mental Hospital, he studied the complex behavioural alterations induced by prefrontal leucotomy, for which the degree of Master of Science was awarded in 1960. Working as a medical officer, he saw a clinical discipline that would unite psychological depth with neurology. In 1961, Walsh joined the teaching staff of the University of Melbourne's Department of Psychology, initially in an honorary position. Walsh taught a syndrome-oriented approach to neuropsychology, informed by an understanding of neuroanatomy, neurological and neuropsychological syndromes and psychometrics. He taught his students to listen to and observe the patient, talk to the family and to think logically, describing neuropsychology as 'a body-contact sport.' Walsh collaborated with his friend Peter Bladin, director of neurology at the Austin Hospital, Melbourne, to establish a postgraduate training program in Clinical Neuropsychology at the university and a Clinical Neuropsychology Unit at the hospital. The first student intake was in 1977. Walsh retired from teaching in 1991. One of his most influential works was Neuropsychology: A Clinical Approach, first published in 1978, intending it to be an introduction to the field. The book was published with David Darby in 1999, then published as Walsh's Neuropsychology in 2005, and was translated into a number of languages.  Conference and organisation  In 1977, Walsh and Gordon Stanley founded the Australian Society for the Study of Brain Impairment (ASSBI), with Walsh as the inaugural president. The organisation has focused on giving aspiring neuropsychologists an environment to meet their peers and more experienced clinicians and researchers. Walsh, Bladin and Stanley hosted a conference called the Brain Impairment Workshop at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne in 1976, where the ASSBI organisational name and logo were chosen and it became the annual conference of the organisation. At the 1978 conference, Walsh gave the opening address entitled ‚ÄòThe Nature of Modern Neuropsychology‚Äô in which he spoke about the studies of neurologists Hans- Lukas Teuber, Brenda Milner and Alexander Luria, who looked at missile wounds from World War II and applied the concept of the neuropsychological syndrome. This was in contrast to the single construct of organic brain damage being advocated by clinical psychologists in the United States of the time. Annual conference proceedings were published until 2000 when the society launched Brain Impairment, a peer-reviewed scientific journal.  Awards  Walsh was honoured with the Order of Australia in the 1991 Australia Day Honours for service to neuropsychology. In 1995, the International Neuropsychological Society (INS) awarded Walsh with an Honorary Membership in recognition of his contribution to Neuropsychology and in 2013 was awarded a Distinguished career Award.

Babylonia had been conquered by the Persians in 539 BC, but through the fifty-five years of Persian rule, the Babylonians had grown dissatisfied with their foreign overlords. Babylon's prestige and significance had diminished as the Persian kings did not become absorbed by the native Babylonian culture and continued to rule from capitals outside of Babylonia. Furthermore, the Persian kings failed in the traditional duties of the Babylonian king in that they rarely partook in Babylon's rituals (which required the presence of a king) and rarely gave cultic gifts in Babylonian temples. Babylonian letters written shortly before the revolt paint a picture of dissatisfaction and concern, as the Persians withdrew the income of Babylonian temple officials without explanation and tax pressures and exploitation of resources increased throughout Babylonia. It is possible that the revolts were not just motivated by a wish to re-establish an independent Babylonian kingdom, but that the revolts also had religious undertones, something which might connect the them to a religious uprising somewhere in the Persian Empire written about in Xerxes's inscriptions. The revolt began in July 484 BC, the fourth month of Xerxes's second year as king. The citizens of Sippar (north of Babylon) proclaimed Shamash-eriba as king of Babylon and he also took for himself the title king of the Lands. In the same month, a second rebel king, Bel-shimanni, was recognised in Borsippa and Dilbat (south of Babylon). Shamash-eriba was still in control of Sippar at this point, which means that the two rebels were contemporaries, either allies or, more likely, rivals. Bel-shimanni's revolt was brief, only lasting about two weeks, most probably either being defeated by Shamash-eriba or willingly giving up his claim and joining with the northern rebel. By September, Shamash-eriba was recognised not only in Sippar and Borsippa, but also in Kish and Babylon itself. The Persians defeated him in October and re-established control of Babylonia. The extent to which Babylon and the Babylonians were reprimanded by Xerxes is unclear. Traditionally, historians have ascribed widespread destruction to the aftermath of the revolts, with Xerxes supposedly having greatly damaged the temples of Babylon and removing the Statue of Marduk, Babylon's main cult image, from the city. The veracity of such claims is unclear, as no evidence exists whatsoever of any damage being done to the cities of Babylonia in 484 BC. Other forms of retribution are evident from the historical evidence; the text archives of a majority of Babylonia's most prominent families end in 484 BC, suggesting targeted revenge against the supporters of the revolts. Additionally, the Persians appear to have worked on dismantling the religious hegemony Babylon held over Babylonia by encouraging the rise of local cults in other Mesopotamian cities, most notably in Uruk.  Background  The Neo- Babylonian Empire, the last great Mesopotamian empire to be ruled by monarchs native to Mesopotamia itself and the final and most spectacular era in Babylonian history, was ended through the Persian Achaemenid conquest of Babylon under Cyrus the Great in 539 BC. After its conquest, Babylon would never again rise to become the single capital of an independent kingdom, much less a great empire. The city, owing to its prestigious and ancient history, continued to be an important site, however, with a large population, defensible walls and a functioning local cult for centuries. The Babylonians worshipped the gods of the Mesopotamian pantheon and the citizens of Babylon above all others revered the god Marduk, the patron deity of the city. Though worship of Marduk never meant the denial of the existence of the other gods, it has sometimes been compared to monotheism. Though Babylon did become one of the Achaemenid Empire's capitals (alongside Pasargadae, Ecbatana and Susa), retaining some importance through not being relegated to just a provincial city, the Persian conquest introduced a ruling class which was not absorbed by the native Babylonian culture, instead maintaining their own additional political centers outside of Mesopotamia. Since the new rulers did not rely on Babylon's significance for their continued rule, the city's prestige had been irreversibly diminished. Although the Persian kings continued to stress Babylon's importance through their titulature, using the royal title king of Babylon and king of the Lands,''''' the Babylonians became less and less enthusiastic in regards to Persian rule as time went on. That the Persians were foreigners probably had very little to do with this resentment; none of the traditional duties and responsibilities of the Babylonian kings required them to be ethnically or even culturally Babylonian; many foreign rulers had enjoyed Babylonian support in the past and many native kings had been despised.''''' More important than a king's origin was whether they fulfilled their royal duties in line with established Babylonian royal tradition. The Persian kings had capitals elsewhere in their empire, rarely partook in Babylon's traditional rituals (meaning that these rituals could not be celebrated in their traditional form since the presence of the king was typically required) and rarely performed their traditional duties to the Babylonian cults through the construction of temples and giving of cultic gifts to the city's gods. As such, the Babylonians might have interpreted them as failing in their duties as kings and thus not having the necessary divine endorsement to be considered true kings of Babylon. Babylon revolted several times against Persian rule in an attempt to regain its independence and the revolts of 484 BC against Xerxes I were not the first time the city rebelled. Xerxes's father and predecessor Darius I (522‚Äì486 BC) faced the rebellions of Nebuchadnezzar III (522 BC) and Nebuchadnezzar IV (521 BC), both of whom claimed to be sons of Nabonidus, Babylon's last independent king.  Historical evidence and chronology  Locations of some major Mesopotamian cities The Babylonian revolts against Darius are easily dated to 522 and 521 BC due to the number of contemporary sources. The revolts of Nebuchadnezzar III and Nebuchadnezzar IV were part of a wider series of uprisings throughout the Persian Empire due to unrest and dissent following the deaths of Persian rulers Cambyses II and Bardiya. The large number of uprisings were only suppressed by Darius with great difficulty and as a result his victory widely commemorated in texts and monuments. Although there was contemporary dissent within the Persian Empire in the 480s BC as well, notably an ongoing revolt in Egypt, the resistance against Persian rule was not as widespread as it had been forty years earlier. Perhaps as a result of this, the Babylonian revolts against Xerxes were not as widely commemorated as those against Darius I. There are no known documents or monuments made by Xerxes that speak of his Babylonian victory and no contemporary Babylonian chroniclers recorded the events of the year. No known later Babylonian documents reflect on what transpired either and though a handful of later Greek historians, such as Herodotus, wrote of a Babylonian uprising against Xerxes, they appear to have lacked precise knowledge of the events that transpired and their dates. In general, evidence in regards to the revolts is sparse and whether all of historical evidence traditionally associated with them is actually related and how it fits together is unclear. The most important evidence are contemporary Babylonian documents that date themselves to the reign of the rebel kings of 484 BC; Bel-shimanni and Shamash-eriba, confirming the existence of the rebels, their names, and their revolt against Persian rule. In addition to these documents, the Daiva inscription by Xerxes, which records the suppression of a religious revolt somewhere in his empire, could be a reference to the revolts, though the inscription does not specify where the revolt took place or who partook in it. Other evidence comes in the form of the works of later Greek and Roman historians. Herodotus wrote that Xerxes captured Babylon after an uprising and removed a statue from the Esagila (Babylon's main temple) as punishment. The Greek historian Ctesias (typically considered unreliable) wrote that Xerxes dealt with two different Babylonian revolts on two separate occasions, the first one being defeated by his general Megabyzus and the second one being defeated by Xerxes himself. The Greco-Roman historian Arrian wrote that Xerxes faced a Babylonian revolt on his way back from Greece in 479 BC and punished the Babylonians for their uprising by closing the Esagila. As Babylonian tablets do not record years in relation to anything other than the first year of a king, the tablets dated to the reigns of Bel-shimanni and Shamash-eriba do not in of themselves provide enough evidence to determine when their revolts took place. As the tablets are dated to the summer months, one method to determine when the revolts took place would be to examine which of the regnal years of Xerxes are missing tablets dated to the summer. However, several different possibilities are then available as there are no known tablets dated to Xerxes's reign from the summers of 484 BC, 479 BC, 477 BC, 475 BC, 473 BC, 472 BC, 468 BC or 466 BC. The first attempt to date Bel-shimanni and Shamash-eriba was made by Arthur Ungnad in 1907, who suggested that they had rebelled during the late reign of Darius I or early reign of Xerxes. He based this on the names of the people mentioned in the legal contracts dated to the two rebels, since these figures were also mentioned in legal contracts written during the reigns of Darius and Xerxes. Based on information contained in the tablets recognising Bel- shimanni, Mariane San Nicol√≤ was in 1934 confidently able to pinpoint his reign to Xerxes's second year as king (484 BC). In 1941, George Glenn Cameron suggested that Shamash-eriba's revolt had taken place in Xerxes's fourth year (482 BC), coinciding with Xerxes supposedly dropping the title king of Babylon. In 1992, Pierre Briant proposed that a better fit would be Xerxes's sixth year (480 BC), since a rebellion in Babylon could help explain why Xerxes mismanaged his ongoing war in Greece. Shamash-eriba's uprising also taking place in 484 BC was not suggested until 2004 by Caroline Waerzeggers, who partly based her date on the archival context of several of the contracts dated to his reign and evidence from previously unpublished cuneiform material. John Oelsner examined her evidence in 2007 and also agreed with 484 BC as the most probable date. Since 2007, 484 BC has been the near-universally accepted date for both revolts. Further evidence examined since then, such as an abrupt end to many Babylonian archives in 484 BC, makes it clear that something remarkable occurred during this year.  Reconstruction of events  The cuneiform tablets dated to the reigns of Bel-shimanni (green) and Shamash- eriba (purple) and the locations of their discovery presented in a timeline. Through examination of the cuneiform evidence, it is possible to approximately reconstruct the events of 484 BC. It is apparent that the Babylonians were dissatisfied with Perisan rule; preserved letters from the Babylonian city of Borsippa, written shortly before 484 BC, suggest a generally worried atmosphere in the city. The incomes of the city's temple officials had been withdrawn by Persian officials without any explanation. Although it is unclear whether this type of sudden and unexplained interference by imperial authorities was restricted to Borsippa or widespread throughout Babylonia, it might have been what allowed the rebel leaders to gather significant enough support to revolt. In addition to this specific example, tax pressures and a general exploitation of Babylonian resources had gradually increased throughout the reign of Xerxes's predecessor, Darius. As the Babylonian establishment was closely linked to religious matters and the Daiva inscription refers to a religious revolt, it is possible that the Babylonian revolts were religious in nature. The contents of Babylonian text archives deposited in 484 BC prove the existence of a large interconnected network of urban elites throughout Babylonia prior to the revolts. Texts deposited in the archives of different families and individuals overlap significantly in style and several figures appear in texts from different archives, proving the existence of inter-personal relationships among Babylonia's elites. These archives implicate several figures as supporters of Bel-shimanni's and Shamash-eriba's revolts, including the governor (≈°ƒÅkin·π≠ƒìmi) of Babylon itself, prebendaries of temples in Sippar (with frequently mentioned figures being the archive owners Marduk-rƒìmanni and Bƒìl-rƒìmanni) as well as the powerful ≈†a- nƒÅ≈°i≈°u family, which controlled the most important religious and civic offices of both Babylon and Sippar in the reign of Darius. Caroline Waerzeggers identified the ≈†a-nƒÅ≈°i≈°u family in the years leading up to 484 BC as \\"ideally positioned to facilitate coordinated action\\". Though contemporary Babylonian documents offer little in regards to events transpiring at a political stage, they can be used to establish a sequence of events as they allow researchers to determine which cities recognised the rule of Bel-shimanni and Shamash- eriba and on what days their rules were recognised. After the death of Darius, Xerxes's rule was initially accepted in Babylonia, despite mounting unrest in the region and an ongoing revolt in Egypt. In the fourth month of Xerxes's second year as king, July 484 BC, the citizens of the city of Sippar proclaimed Shamash-eriba, of unclear origin, as king. He took the title king of Babylon and of the lands. Shamash-eriba's proclamation as king, though he did not yet control Babylon itself, was the first open act of revolt from the Babylonians since the uprising of Nebuchadnezzar IV in 521 BC. Tablets recognising Bel-shimanni in Borsippa and Dilbat, cities south of Sippar, are known from just ten days after the earliest tablets recognising Shamash-eriba. As most Babylonian names did, the names of both rebels incorporate the names of Mesopotamian deities. Shamash-eriba's name incorporates the deity Shamash, a sun god and the patron deity of Sippar (where Shamash-eriba's rebellion began). Bel-shimanni's name incorporates B√™l, meaning \\"lord\\", a common designation for Marduk.'''''' As Shamash-eriba was still recognised by the citizens of Sippar at this point, there was suddenly two contemporary Babylonian rebels. Though both fought against the Persians, Waerzeggers speculated in 2018 that they, as rival claimants, might also have fought against each other. As the ruler of Sippar, Shamash-eriba's revolt initially gained ground in northern Babylonia whereas Bel-shimanni power-base was south of Babylon, in Borsippa and Dilbat. Nothing is known of the background of either of the rebel leaders. Caroline Waerzeggers suggested a number of possibilities in 2018, writing that the most likely possibilities were that they were army officers, local governors or religious leaders. As their names are Babylonian, both were probably native Babylonians. As tablets dated to the reign of Bel-shimanni only cover a period of about two weeks,''''' it is clear that his reign was terminated through some means and Shamash-eriba later remained as the only contender facing Xerxes. Bel-shimanni might have been defeated by Shamash-eriba or willingly merged his uprising with that of his northern contender. Halfway through September, the cities of Sippar, Babylon, Borsippa and Kish are known to have supported Shamash-eriba's rule. As no documents recognise Shamash-eriba's rule after October, it is likely that the Persians defeated him in that month.  Aftermath  Though the revolts themselves were only brief interruptions of Persian dominion, their aftermath saw large-scale and significant changes to political institutions and society in Babylonia as the Persians cemented their control of the region.  Xerxes as a \\"destroyer of Babylon\\"  9th century BC depiction from a cylinder seal of the Statue of Marduk, Babylon's patron deity Marduk's main cult image in the city It is disputed and unclear whether Xerxes's response in Babylonia was measured or violent and what its long-term effects were on Babylonian society. The orthodox view, most clearly expressed by George Glenn Cameron in 1941 and Franz Marius Theodor de Liagre B√∂hl in 1962, is that Babylon was harshly reprimanded, with Xerxes ruining the city, taking away the Statue of Marduk (Babylon's main cult image of Marduk), which in turn prevented the celebration of Akitu (the Babylonian New Year's festival, which required the statue's presence), splitting the large Babylonian satrapy (\\"Babylon-and-across-the- River\\") into two smaller provinces, and removing the title king of Babylon from his royal titulature. Other researchers, such as Hans-J√∂rg Schmid in 1981, further embellished the details of this supposed retribution, considering it possible the Esagila was destroyed and that the river Euphrates was diverted. Evidence to support Xerxes unleashing heavy retribution upon Babylon include that Daiva inscription, which supposedly encapsulates Xerxes I's intolerant religious policy, as well as the decreasing number of clay tablets from Babylonia after his reign, perhaps illustrating the region's decline. Other researchers, such as Am√©lie Kuhrt and Susan Sherwin-White in 1987, consider the ideas forwarded by B√∂hl and others as being \\"based on a careless reading of Herodotus combined with incomplete Babylonian evidence and an implicit wish to make very disparate types of material harmonize with a presumed ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù of Xerxes‚Äô actions, policies and character\\". The primary evidence that the Statue of Marduk was removed from the Esagila comes from Herodotus, but the relevant passage in his text only reads that the \\"statue of a man\\" was removed, with no indication that this is supposed to be the statue of the god. Xerxes cannot be responsible for suspending the Babylonian Akitu festival since the festival had already been suspended for quite some time before Xerxes became king. Furthermore, the title king of Babylon was not abruptly dropped by Xerxes, who continued to use it (albeit less often) in the years after the Babylonian revolts. There is even evidence that Xerxes's successor, Artaxerxes I, used the title at times. The gradual disappearance of the title might reflect the stabilisation of the Persian Empire into a more integrated political unit, rather than some instant punishment against Babylon. Following re-assessments in the 1990s, most modern scholars agree that viewing Xerxes as the \\"destroyer of Babylonian temples\\" would be erroneous and based on uncritical misreadings of classical sources alongside an attempt to forcefully fit sparse Babylonian references into the hypothesis. The lesser number of clay tablets from the reign of Xerxes and later might be attributable not to Persian oppression but to a multitude of other factors, such as accidents, the appearance of new forms of recordkeeping and new writing technologies or the further spread the Aramaic language. The ruins of major cities in Babylonia show no evidence of having suffered any destruction whatsoever in the 480s BC.  End of the Babylonian archives  The Neo- Babylonian Text Corpus is a collection of documents and texts which document the history of Babylonia under Assyrian, Babylonian and subsequent Persian rule. Two-thirds of the large number of tablets were deposited in a single year, 484 BC. The texts are relatively decentralised and organic in content up until documents written in 484 BC, which are more homogenised and politicised. This suggests widespread support of Bel-shimanni and Shamash-eriba among many of the authors. Caroline Waerzeggers wrote in 2004 that the archives were probably abandoned (or otherwise deposited) in the aftermath of the revolts, possible as the result of Persian intervention as an effect of targeted revenge against those who supported the revolts. Those archives that continue beyond 484 BC were written by local clients of the Persian governing elite in Babylonia, such as managers and caretakers of estates owned by Persian landlords. Many of them were of rural origin, tied to the Persian state through its systems of governance. In contrast, those whose archives cease in 484 BC were overwhelmingly people who lived in the cities, their ideology not rooted in their relationship to the new Persian overlords but to the political tradition of Babylonia in the form of the country's temples and cities; urban institutions had been established long before the Persian conquest and were run by a small number of families intimately connected through status, education, employment and marriage. Most of the closed archives are from the main rebel centers of 484 BC; Babylon, Borsippa and Sippar, whereas surviving archives are mainly from cities such as Ur, Uruk and Kutha, which may not have supported the uprising. The contrasting origins and status of the people whose archives survived 484 BC and those whose archives did not point to a clear political division between the two groups. Waerzeggers argued in 2004 that the former group represented a pro-Babylonian faction aspiring to overthrow Persian rule whilst the latter represented a pro-Persian faction content with Persian dominion. The end of the archives coincides with the disappearance of elite families with roots in Babylon from southern Babylonia, suggesting that the Persian retribution at least partially focused on dismantling what remained of the pro-Babylonian faction in the aftermath of the revolts. It is probable that repercussions against these individuals was not limited to just closing their archives and probably reflected the removal of previously enjoyed privileges in several areas. The end of the archives does not appear to have been unexpected for their owners. The most precious and valuable types of tablets, such as property deeds, are not found among the contents of the corpus, the owners probably having taken these with them.  Religious reorganisation of Uruk  It is unclear whether the city of Uruk supported the 484 BC revolts. No evidence exists that any city in southern Babylonia supported the revolts, but this might be attributable to poor documentation, since it is clear that cities in the south suffered from the effects of Persian retribution in the aftermath of Shamash-eriba's defeat. Evidence from Uruk in particular demonstrates that the city experienced a dramatic series of societal changes in 484 BC. By 484 BC, a small number of prominent families of Babylonian origin had dominated the local politics of Uruk for generations. These were all driven out from the city after the end of the revolts and replaced with a new group of locals. As noted by Waerzeggers and Karlheinz Kessler in 2004, this shift in the elites of the city had considerable effects on local culture and politics as the new families implemented their own cultural and political programs separate from those of Babylon. Perhaps most dramatically, the city's most prominent place of worship, the Eanna temple, was closed and dismantled; replaced with new temples and new theological leanings distinct from those that had previously been imposed through influence from Babylon. The most prominent of these new temples were the Rƒì≈° and the Irigal (or E≈°gal), both of which would survive for centuries thereafter. By this time, Uruk's principal deities were the goddesses Ishtar and Nanaya, typically described in inscriptions as the \\"owners\\" of Uruk's primary temples. In the aftermath of the Babylonian defeat, Ishtar and Nanaya were replaced at the top of the local pantheon by the god Anu, with the city's civic religion being reorganised into a nearly hegemonic cult of this god. Evidence for Anu's rise include the shift of naming patterns to names that more frequently incorporate Anu, as well as Anu from 484 BC onwards being described as the owner of Uruk's temples instead of Ishtar and Nanaya. Anu had been important in Uruk for some time but was also the ancestral head of the Mesopotamian pantheon. His rise to the top of the pantheon at Uruk might have been a symbolic assertion by the city to counter the central religious authority of Babylon. A collection of texts describing the Esagila and rituals dedicated to Anu in Uruk might be an example of the priests of Uruk being influenced by the priests dedicated to Marduk in Babylon, meaning that they might have viewed their new main temple, the Rƒì≈° as a counterpart to the Esagila in Babylon. Architecturally, the Rƒì≈° was very similar to the Esagila and in cuneiform signs, its name was inscribed as √â.SAG, conspicuously similar to the rendering of the Esagila's name, √â.SAG.√çL. Paul-Alain Beaulieu believes that it is possible that Anu's rise was either imposed or encouraged by the Persians in the aftermath of the defeat of the Babylonian revolts. Persian authorities might have perceived the cult in Uruk as a counterweight to the religious hegemony exerted by Babylon.

It grows on karst limestone on the island's makatea (fossilised uplifted reef), and grows to a height of 10m. While previously believed to only be found on Mitiaro, in 2007 several clusters of fan palms on the islands of Niau and Makatea in the Tuamotus in French Polynesia were classified as belonging to the same species. Rarotongan oral histories record that there was once a strong sea route between Nuia, the southern Cook Islands and the Marquesas, which could have seen the plant transported between the islands. In 2007 there were an estimated 1000 individuals on Nuia, and around 100 on Makatea. In 2019 there were 491 mature Iniao on Mitiaro.

He previously was a member of the black metal bands Vanh√§vd and Vapenlicens, before becoming interested in 80's-influenced film scores.  Works and Style  Irving Force's musical and aesthetic style is influenced by 1980's action films and characters, such as John Carpenter films and his character Snake Plissken. Skog originally intended Irving Force to have a more pop oriented sound, but the music soon took on elements from his heavy metal past. He also cites cyberpunk science fiction from all types of media and the band Tangerine Dream as further influences. Having come from a film-score background, much of Irving Force's music is designed to have some sort of narrative or story element - such as his 2015 release The Violence Suppressor. A video was filmed for the title track on that album, which was made to invoke classic sci-fi movies like Assault on Precinct 13 and Judge Dredd. Following releases were set out to take place in a loose thematic universe. In April 2020, Irving Force provided the soundtrack for the Android retro point & click adventure game Awaken Alone. His music has been described by reviewers as \\"guiding the listener through cyberpunk narratives that twist and mutate with a musical playfulness\\" . Others have praised it's \\"next level grooves\\" and \\"balls to the wall rhythms\\".

History  Metropolis Ukraine was founded in 2010 as a subsidiary of the Russian company Megapolis, owned by Russian businessman Igor Kesaev, after he purchased two largest tobacco companies of West Ukraine. In 2010, Metropolis Ukraine controlled 50% of the Ukrainian tobacco market. In 2012-2013, international tobacco companies Philip Morris International, Japan Tobacco International, Imperial Tobacco and British American Tobacco switched from independent distribution in Ukraine to the distribution via Megapolis-Ukraine. These four companies produce 90% of cigarettes in Ukraine. Megapolis Ukraine purchased main other tobacco distributors of Ukraine and became de facto monopoly that controls more than 99% of the Ukrainian tobacco market. In 2014, after annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, Russian companies in Ukraine, including Metropolis Ukraine, faced problems. In 2015, Kesaev's representatives announced that he had quit Ukrainian business. At the end of 2015, a part of Megapolis Ukraine was sold to Boris Kaufman, a businessman from Odessa. In 2016, there was a scandal with Metropolis Ukraine, because Degtyaryov Plant, also owned by Kesaev, allegedly supplied weapons to the separatists in the War in Donbass. The warehouses of Megapolis Ukraine in six cities were blocked by activists. The company management claimed that Russian shareholders withdrew from it. After the scandal, the company changed its name to Tedis Ukraine. In 2017, Anti-Monopoly Committee of Ukraine (AMC) accused Tedis Ukraine of monopolizing the Ukrainian tobacco market. Tax evasion and terrorist financing have also been claimed. According to Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yuriy Lutsenko, in 2015‚Äî2017 there were 2.5 billion hryvnias that were transferred from Ukraine into Russia through several companies, including Tedis Ukraine, and ‚Äúsome of them were used to fund the terrorist organizations LPR and DPR.\\" In 2017, Tedis Ukraine was fined 300 million hryvnias after the court proceedings initiated by AMC, and in 2019 it was fined 3,4 billion hryvnias more. AMC announced its intention to forcefully split the company.  Description  Tedis Ukraine is the Ukrainian distributor of international companies Philip Morris International, Japan Tobacco International, Imperial Tobacco and British American Tobacco, which make 99% of their sales in Ukraine through Tedis Ukraine. The purchased tobacco products are resold to 40-50 wholesale companies and 80,000 retail companies. As of 2020, Tedis Ukraine had 35 regional branches with 2,500 employees. In 2016 –≥–æ–¥—É, it paid 9 billion hryvnias in taxes, becoming one of the five largest taxpayers of Ukraine. In 2013, Megapolis Ukraine's revenue was 27.5 billion hryvnia, and it ranked fifth in the Forbes Ukraine 200 largest companies of Ukraine. As of 2017, among the owners of Tedis Ukraine were Boris Kaufman (47.22%), as well as British citizens Richard Duxbury (23.51%) and Richard Dorian Fenhalls.

He served two times as Rector of the Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza. A noted abolitionist, he was a key figure in the campaign for the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico and Cuba.  Biography  Born in Havana (both 7 September 1840 and 1841 have been reported as birth date), son to Rafaela Gonz√°lez Cadrana (a Cuban-Asturian) and Ram√≥n Mar√≠a de Labra (a Liberal army officer from Asturias, defender of the 1812 Constitution who had been exiled during the Ominous Decade, destined to Cuba in 1836). Rafael moved to Mainland Spain in 1849 with his family, establishing early in Madrid after briefly passing by Almer√≠a and C√°diz. A teenage Labra joined the Ateneo de Madrid as member on 15 November 1857. He was the founder (or editor) of a number of newspapers such as La Tribuna, El Correo de Espa√±a or El Correo de Ultramar. He took studies at the Central University of Madrid, where he where he became a disciple of , and ; he earned a licentiate degree in Philosophy and Letters in 1858, Administrative Law (1862) and Civil and Canon Law (1862). His \\"dangerous or condemnable ideas\\" on colonial policies prevented him from becoming an university professor. A member of the Spanish Abolitionist Society, Labra became its president in 1869. He became a member of the Congress of Deputies after the 1871 election, in representation of the district of Infiesto (Asturias). He would earn again a seat as member of the Lower House in representation of Sabana Grande (Puerto Rico; 1872; 1874); Havana (1879) and Santa Clara (Cuba; 1885). He was also a member of the Spanish Senate, elected in representation of the University of Havana and in representation of the Sociedad Econ√≥mica de Amigos del Pa√≠s de Le√≥n. Labra's first tenure as president of the Instituci√≥n Libre de Ense√±anza (ILE) lasted from 1881 to 1882. He returned to the presidency of the ILE in 1885, remaining at the post until his death. He was elected to the presidency of the government board of the Ateneo de Madrid in February 1913, serving in that capacity until his death. He died on 16 April 1918, in Madrid.  Views  Labra, who along his parliamentary history espoused autonomist stances vis-√†-vis the Cuban question, remarked in 1898 that \\"he was not an advocate of the independence of our Antilles\\", always defending the compatibility of autonomy of the colonies and Spanish national integrity. A convinced Republican, he adhered to the Republican-Evolutionist line during the First Spanish Republic. According to the Count of Romanones, if Labra had reneged on his republican faith, he would have hold top offices in Spanish politics (of the Restoration), being reportedly asked several times to join the government. Described as a \\"Revolutionary Liberal\\", he was a key campaigner for the abolition of slavery in Cuba and Puerto Rico. He was also a pacifist. Adhered to Krausist social organicism, he defended the instruction and education of the people as a mean to bridge the gap between social classes and as vehicle for the formation of a strong public opinion, thus facilitating the participation of people in politics.

He wrote 17 plays for kunqu and regional operas. He was the Superintendent of the Imperial porcelain works in Jingdezhen where he served over a period twenty-eight years under two emperors. His tenure at the Imperial kilns was noted for some of the finest porcelain produced during the Qing dynasty, and the porcelain produced under his supervision is known as Tangyao (ÂîêÁ™Ø) or Tang ware. Early life Tang Ying was born on the 5th day of the 5th month in the 21st year of Kangxi reign (1682) in Fengtian (Â•âÂ§©) in today's Shenyang, Liaoning. His great-grand-father Tang Yingzu was a bondservant leader serving in the Plain White Banner of the Han army, therefore he was technically born a bondservant, but he is normally described as a Han Bannerman in Chinese biographies. He entered into the service of the Imperial Household Department when he was 16 working as a page. He worked in Yangxin Hall which housed a library of books and paintings; there he acquired a knowledge of art and skill in painting, design and writings. In 1723, soon after Yongzheng became emperor, he was appointed to the position of Vice Director of the Imperial Household Department, acting as foreman for the artisans working in the Imperial workshops. Porcelain While he was working at the Imperial Household Department, Tang Ying produced designs for decorating porcelain pieces. In 1728, during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor, Tang Ying was sent to Jingdezhen in Jiangxi to surpervise the production of Imperial porcelain. Tang was initially assistant to Nian Xiyao, working as the resident Manager at Jingdezhen. Tang was said to have learnt making pottery by living closely with the workmen at Jingdezhen for three years. In 1735, during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor, he replaced Nian who was accused of corruption. Although in control of Jingdezhen as Superintendent of the Imperial porcelain works, he was stationed most of the time at Huai'an or Jiujiang Custom Offices since he was also responsible for collecting custom duties. Tang was the only superintendent who had a close understanding of the potting process, and played a significant role in the development of ceramics production in Jingdezhen. Under Tang's surpervision, the quality of the Jingdezhen improved and some of the finest porcelain produced during the Qing dynasty were made during his tenure. He was able to communicate effectively what the Emperor wanted to the workmen to produce the ware required, and his writings on porcelain provided invaluable information on the production of Jingdezhen porcelain in this period. He also personally made porcelain pieces signed with his various names. Tang Ying introduced a number of innovations during his tenure at Jingdezhen, such as new colours (for example different shades of purple and blue) and glazes, and introduced new designs and techniques (e.g. silvering and painting in ink black). He managed to reproduce textures and effects of wares of other material such as silver, wood, jade or bronze, copied porcelain from other countries, and he was also known for revival of old forms and faithful imitation of antique wares such as those of the Song era. Porcelain pieces produced for two Qing emperors under Tang Ying's supervision are highly regarded, and their quality is considered unmatched before or during his time. A vase believed to have been presented by Tang Ying to Qianlong Emperor fetched a record price of US$69.5 million at auction in 2010, although it was later sold for US$35 million after the original buyer disputed the auctioneer's fees. Another was sold for US$19 million in 2018, while a smaller piece from 1742 sold for US$9 million in 2020. These yangcai vases have a reticulated form with double walls, an innovation introduced by Tang Ying in the early 1740s. These vases were technically difficult and expensive to produce and Tang Ying presented nine single such vases to Qianlong. Tang also served for a short period (1750‚Äì51) in Canton in the Maritime Customs Service. He returned to Jingdezhen, but retired in 1756 and died shortly afterwards on the 27th day of the 7th month the same year. Although his successor was able to maintain some standard at Jingdezhen, the quality of porcelain produced declined, and after the reign Qianlong, the quality of porcelain produced in Jingdezhen deteriorated. Theatre Tang Ying became interested in the local popular theatre. He was unusual in seeking inspiration from local theatre for his plays, and wrote eclectic plays that mixed Kunqu opera melodies with local ones. More of half of the plays he wrote feature content derived from popular local theatre. He wrote 17 operas, among the best-known are Crossroad at the Slope () and Laughter in a Flour Barrel (). Crossroad at the Slope is a single-act play derived from the local bangzi opera (ÊäòÂ≠êÊà≤), and features a story from the Water Margin. Laughter in a Flour Barrel tells the story of a quick-witted courtesan who survived abuse. Other plays include Predestined Debt (), a twenty-scene play from 1754. Other works Tang Ying wrote or supervised the writing of a number of books on porcelain which are important documents on porcelain making during the Qing dynasty, such as The Order of Porcelain-making (Twenty Illustrations of the Manufacture of Pottery) (Èô∂ÂÜ∂ÂúñÁ∑®Ê¨°), a book written at Qianlong's command. Other books on pottery include Record of Pottery Production (Èô∂ÊàêÁ¥Ä‰∫ã), A Summary of the Pottery Business (Èô∂ÂãôÊïòÁï•), and Draughts of Instructions on the Manufacture of Porcelain (Áì∑Âãô‰∫ãÂÆúË´≠Á®ø). Tang also wrote poetry and excelled at calligraphy and paintings. His poetry is collected in Collections of Songs during the Reign of Kangxi and in Potters Thoughts (Èô∂‰∫∫ÂøÉËØ≠). His calligraphy and paintings are kept among the Palace Museum collection.

He was commissioner of Lusambo Province in the Belgian Congo from 1 October 1933 to 17 August 1940. Life Constant Joseph Antoine Wauters was born on 25 April 1889. He entered the colonial service on 29 September 1910. In 1927 Wauters was urban commissioner of L√©opoldville. He was concerned that the slum-like Cit√© Indig√®ne was too close to the European town, and potentially a source of disease. He proposed four related policies for African townships: they should be separated from the European quarters by a \\"neutral zone\\"; sanitation should be provided for; they should be compact rather than fragmented; they should adhere to standard construction approaches. Wauters favored having all the houses built by one firm rather than leaving it up to the residents, but did not want the government directly involved in construction of housing. Wauters was named Commissaire g√©n√©ral assistant to the governor of the province of Congo-Kasa√Ø on 1 April 1930. On 4 June 1931 Wauters temporarily assumed the role of governor of Congo-Kasai in place of Joseph Beernaert, who was temporarily replacing Governor General Auguste Tilkens. Due to disturbances among the African population, Wauters asked for reinforcements and changed the stature of the Kikwit and Kandale territories from Occupation to Police Operation. Wauters was active in directing the forces of Congo-Kasa√Ø as the revolt of the Pende people progressed. Order hed been restored by September 1931. The administrative reform of 1933 rearranged the four original provinces into six new provinces, created a single deputy governor general, and removed this title from the heads of the provinces, who were now called provincial commissioners. Wauters was among them. On 1 October 1933 he succeeded Paul Ermens, governor of Congo-Kasa√Ø, as commissioner of the new province of Lusambo, which was formed from the eastern part of Congo-Kasa√Ø, a small part of Equateur Province and the Lomami District of Katanga Province. He left office on 11 September 1940 and was succeeded by R. Wenner. In 1949 Wauters published a 384-page book L'√©sot√©rie des Noirs d√©voil√©e about the Bukishi of the Basonge people living along the Lomami River. His main interest was in the secret knowledge of the Bukishi rather than their sociological function. He saw their doctrine as being concerned with understanding and experiencing the ultimate reality as a vital force, and interpreted their texts in terms of symbolic meaning, but he left in doubt the authenticity of this interpretation.

He was arrested thanks to a DNA profiling exam.  Biography  Dellmus Colvin was born on August 3, 1959. Grew up in the countryside of Akron, Ohio. Colvin spent his childhood and youth in a socially prosperous environment. In his teenage years, he entered into a social conflict with his mother, but he was not noticed in the manifestation of aggressive behavior. In high school, Colvin played for the American football teams and Greco-Roman wrestling teamAfter graduating from high school, Dellmus mastered the profession of a driver, after which he worked as a taxi driver in Atlantic City and its various suburbs. In the mid-1980s, he began to show signs of anti-social behavior and had problems with social skills. He was unpopular in the area, and began leading a criminal lifestyle, often preferring to spend time in the company of prostitutes. In the late 1980s, Colvin moved to Ohio, where over the years he lived in the cities of Swanton, Lima, Orient and Toledo. In 1989, in Summit County, he was arrested on assault charges and illegal weapons possession. He was convicted and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment. Dellmus was paroled in 1992, but was jailed again in July 1993 for violating his parole. Three years later, he was released a second time and moved to Toledo, where he soon found work as a truck driver. In subsequent years, he was seen displaying increasingly impulsive and violent behavior towards women. In April 2004, he was arrested after a woman contacted police, claiming that Colvin kidnapped her from a truck stop, robbing, beating and attempting to rape her, but she managed to escape. During the investigation, a blood and saliva sample was taken from him for DNA testing, in order to see if he had committed any similar crimes in the past.  Exposure  In November 2005, based on the results from the DNA analysis, Dellmus Colvin was charged with the murders of two prostitutes: 33-year-old Jackie Simpson and 37-year-old Melissa Weber, who were murdered on April 16 and May 9, 2003 in Toledo, respectively. In addition, he was charged with a rape that occurred that same year. In September 2006, Colvin stood trial for the murders. During said trial, the Lucas County Attorney General's Office, which suspected Colvin was responsible for more murders due to his occupation as a truck driver, proposed a plea bargain in exchange for removing the death penalty off the table. Agreeing to the proposal, Dellmus pleaded guilty to the murders of Simpson and Weber, as well as three others. According to his testimony, in January 2000, he lured 38-year-old Valerie Jones into his truck, strangled her, and then dumped her body in Lake Erie, in Ottawa County; on September 1 of that year, he lured 42-year-old Jacquelynn Thomas into his truck's cabin, after which he violated and subsequently killed her. Her body was found the next day in Monroe County. In April 2005, he killed 43-year-old Lily Summers, whom he had previously offered money in exchange for sex. All three were engaged in prostitution, and were drug addicts. On October 3, 2006, Colvin unexpectedly confessed to another murder. He admitted to his involvement in the murder of 40-year-old Dorothea Wetzel, who was found murdered on August 5, 2000 on the banks of the Maumee River in southern Toledo. During interrogation, Colvin stated that his motive for the killings was misogyny, which was caused by his sexual complexes and inferiority complex. In October of that year, on the basis of the plea bargain, he was given several terms of life imprisonment. In June 2010, Colvin was charged with the cold case murder of 27-year-old Donna Lee White, who was killed on September 15, 1987 in Atlantic City. Dellmus was extradited to New Jersey, where he appeared before the court in April 2011. During the trial, he plead guilty to White's murder. In his statement, he claimed to have met Donna while working as a taxi driver, after which he made the girl an offer to go to his apartment, where they would drink and have sex, to which she supposedly agreed. A few hours later, Donna began taking drugs, and fainted from an overdose. However, instead of helping her, Colvin strangled her with a plastic bag and then dumped the body on the outskirts of the city. Based on his testimony, in April 2011, Dellmus Colvin was convicted of White's murder and received an additional 30 years imprisonment, to be served concurrently with his life sentences. In September 2020, during a telephone conversation with criminal profiler Phil Chalmers, Colvin claimed that, between 1983 and 2005, he killed 52 girls and women across the United States. To support his claims, he shared details about the murder of a prostitute he committed in 2005 in LaSalle County, Illinois, near Ottawa. According to his testimony, after committing the murder, he dumped the victim's body in an abandoned building located in the small town of Peru. Following Colvin's statement, the LaSalle County Sheriff authorized a search at the designated dump site, resulting in two bones, believed to belong to a woman's skeleton, were found by law enforcement officials. They were subsequently taken to a forensic anthropologist for identification.Man admits to killing 52 female victims from 1983 to 2005 in IllinoisAuthorities find bones in Illinois based on killer's remarks.

Despite negative reception from his co-workers and Trax owner Larry Sherman, Jefferson's track \\"Move Your Body\\" became popular with patrons of Chicago dance music clubs in 1985 from cassette tapes, leading to the tracks eventual release in August 1986. \\"Move Your Body\\" opens with a piano chord and is among the earliest house music tracks to feature piano. The music recorded for the song was originally played much slower during the recording process and sped up by Jefferson for its final release. Outside Jefferson's involvement, the song features an uncredited vocal performance from his friend Curtis McClain that feature lyrics revolving ones enthusiasm and losing themselves in house music. Background In 1985, Marshall Jefferson worked a post office and went to a music store with his friend who was a guitarist. Jefferson was a fan of rock music, specifically noting bands such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, stating he \\"bought the records with every penny [he had].\\" as well as attending the Music Box club in Chicago. At the store, a salesperson came up to him and showed him the Yamaha 284 synthesizer telling him it could play it like a professional keyboard player even if you never had lessons. Jefferson received a line of credit from his work and not only bought the sequencer along with a keyboard, drum machine and a mixer which totalled up to around $9,000. Jefferson took the equipment home and wrote his first song two days later. This equipment would also be used for making \\"Move Your Body\\". Jefferson described the music as he played as being dance music that he felt would \\"sound right at the Music Box\\" despite not being able to attend due to working late hours at the post office. Derrick Harris, a friend of Jefferson's known as Sleezy visited him and asked for a cassette copy of the song Jefferson had created. Sleezy took Jefferson's music to the Music Box club where the DJ Ron Hardy would play, which led to Sleezy returning to Jefferson stating how popular his music had gotten at the club. This led to Jefferson completing more tracks leading to Jefferson proclaiming he had \\"like 15 songs playing in the Music Box\\". Lawrence eventually connected with Ron Hardy and continued to give him cassettes of his work, including tracks stated in an interview in 2005 that \\"were never put out.\\" Jefferson began developing records after looking at Jesse Saunders record and went to the address on the Trax Records and Precision Records labels. On meeting with Larry Sherman of Trax, he helped release Jefferson's first record of \\"Go Wild Rhythm Tracks\\" as Virgo. Jefferson spoke negatively about his work with Sherman, stating \\"it just fucked my head all the way up!\\" and later declared that Sherman \\"was like heading everybody off and stuff and trying to fuck them up, and make them quit the music business because he knew it was easy to make the music!\\" Jefferson explained that Sherman was predominantly keeping a low profile and worked with smaller labels distributors as he did not want a lot of attention brought to him as he was running a \\"chop shop\\" above Trax Records, a place where stolen cars were torn apart and had spare parts sold from them which was where Sherman larger profits came from. By 1986, Jefferson was the head of A&R; for Trax Records. Production For \\"Move Your Body\\", Jefferson stated he wanted to have something on the track that would \\"drive the rack forward\\" and felt that a piano would do this. The song was developed with minor chords which Jefferson found easier to perform. Jefferson called two of his friends who were co-workers at the post office, Thomas Carr and Rudy Forbes, who went into the studio with him to make the record which Jefferson estimated had travel time, recording and mixing took about five or six hours. To play the piano intro, Jefferson recalled that he recorded the keyboards at about forty to forty-five beats per minute then sped it up. Jefferson did this for other tracks as well, such as playing the bassline at 40 beats per minute and then speeding it up to 122 beats per minute. To make it sound natural and not mechanically sped up, Jefferson linked the notes up and know how much I was going to lengthen each one by to be able to fit them together, which Jefferson commented that he \\"learned how to do that on the fly, too, because I had to.\\" The vocals on \\"Move Your Body\\" were performed by Jefferson's friend Curtis McClain. Jefferson was very enthusiastic about the track but his friends told him it was awful and it needed to be fixed, a reaction that surprised Jefferson. Jefferson received similar reactions to the track from his friends Mike Dunn, Tyree Cooper and Hugo Hutchinson who merely said that the track was OK. In August 1985, Jefferson took the track to Ron Hardy who was very enthusiastic about it and when Jefferson attended the Music Box it was played six times in a row to an enthusiastic crowd. Music In his book Inner Sound: Altered States of Consciousness in Electronic Music and Audio-visual Media, Jonathan Weinel described the track as a Chicago house track began with piano chords over a time signature. The track contains vocals declaring \\"Gimmie that house music to set me free / Lost in house music is where I wanna be\\" with a refrain of \\"Move Your Body / Rock Your Body\\". Weinel noted that the lyrics celebrate the \\"ecstatic revelry and physicality of losing oneself in dance\\" while critic Simon Reynolds reflected that \\"the social scene of Chicago house was one in which gay black men were able to find liberating communal experience of dance in response to their status as exiles from mainstream culture.\\" Weinel reflected on this noting that these themes extended to other Chicago house tracks such as Joe Smooth's \\"Promised Land\\" and Fingers Inc.'s \\"Can You Feel It\\". Release Despite having pressed the track early, \\"Move Your Body\\" was not released initially by Trax as Larry Sherman did not like, with Jefferson recollecting that Sherman proclaimed it not to be house music. This response led to Jefferson adding the phrase \\"The House Music Anthem\\" to the title of the track. British journalists came to Chicago to report on the house music phenomenon which led to Sherman taking them to about five clubs with each DJ playing \\"Move Your Body\\" to a positive reaction which led to the track being released by Trax. It was released by Trax in June 1986 with Jefferson commenting that \\"It probably never would have come out but it had gotten so big in all the clubs in Chicago.\\" The label for the record listed Marshall Jefferson as the artist on the record opposed to his alias of Virgo as the creator which Jefferson reflecting that it \\"basically screwed up my Virgo nickname for the rest of my life because it was my biggest hit and I had to use Marshall Jefferson from then on. And it was a shame because I used to love that Virgo nickname. Everywhere I went people would be like ‚ÄúVirgo! Virgo! Virgo!‚Äù to me. But in one fell swoop, he wiped out my nickname. [laughs] Man! I really wish I‚Äôd had a nickname!\\" The track would be released under various alterations of the title, such as its subsequent releases on DJ International Records such as \\"Move Your Body ‚Äî House Music Anthem\\". This version was a longer track, with Jefferson feeling that he ‚Äústupidly thought I could do a better version in a big studio\\". In 2005, Jefferson stated he received no publishing cheques from any of his songs including \\"Move Your Body\\", despite having paid the money to have \\"Move Your Body\\" pressed to vinyl. The rights to the track were eventually owned by Jefferson himself in 2012. Impact and legacy The Guardian featured it on their A history of modern music: Dance in 2011.

It is the fifth book of six in Wells's John Cleaver series. Set a year after the conclusion of The Devil's Only Friend, the book continues the story of sociopathic teenage protagonist John Wayne Cleaver and his best friend Brooke as they drift around the Midwestern U.S. in search of a network of supernatural killers called \\"the Withered.\\" Brooke suffers from dissociative identity disorder after surviving demonic possession, and her alternate personalities are key to discovering the other demons. The majority of critics approved of this fifth addition to the series, and the book won the 2016 AML Award for Best Novel. It is followed by the sixth and final novel in the John Cleaver series, Nothing Left to Lose.  Development  For this fifth installment of John's story, Wells continued the character's second arc of learning how to cope with his emotions after discovering them in the first trilogy. He told Deseret News in 2016 that Over Your Dead Body was his most challenging writing experience yet because of the \\"aimless\\" feeling he wanted the story of John and Brooke on the road to have. Wells said that writing a \\"wandering story without the book itself feeling directionless proved even harder, far harder than [he] had expected it to be.\\" He wanted the novel to \\"take John in a completely new direction again\\" after the events of The Devil's Only Friend. He also cited Brooke's character as \\"especially tricky to get right.\\"  Plot summary  John and Brooke are now on their own: hungry, dirty, and hunting down the \\"Withered\\" (demons in human form) using Brooke's memories from when she was possessed. They rely on stashes of supplies and money that Agent Potash, one of John's FBI team members, had stored before his death. Wanted by the FBI, the pair have been hitchhiking to different cities and towns for a year. They find a commune where the demon Yashodh is the leader, and John kills him quickly with a gun. They then move on to their next destination ‚Äì the small town of Dillon, Oklahoma ‚Äì and when they arrive, a new personality manifests itself through Brooke: Marci, John's former girlfriend who was killed by the demon Nobody. This proves to be extremely difficult for him; he is able to talk to the dead girl he loves, but she is trapped in Brooke's body and often gets replaced by the other personalities. Meanwhile, John struggles with the temptation to kill anyone who gets in their way. They move on to Dallas, where John notices they are being followed by a black SUV, which they assume is the FBI. A news report then reveals that a gruesome murder just occurred in Dillon, the town John and Brooke just left. They go back and make friends with a teenage boy named Corey (who they suspect is the demon Attina) and two sisters: Brielle and Jessica. The next day, both Jessica and Corey are found dead. John suspects that Attina is reading his mind. Then, Brooke has a suicidal episode, and the police seize her and John; they are sent to a hospital, where FBI Agent Mills shows up. He takes them back to Dillon to try to stop Attina, and when they arrive, they find two more people dead. One was the pedophile police officer who was found with Jessica the night of her murder, and Brielle is presented as the primary suspect; John had even heard her vow to kill the predator if he ever did anything to her sister. John is frustrated with his inability to figure out Attina, and postulates that he's driving the people in the town crazy enough to kill each other. He immediately tries to get Brooke to safety, but the demon ‚Äì in the form of a giant monster ‚Äì captures her. Desperate, John follows his idea that Brielle is Attina. He goes to her house, holding her family at gunpoint to get information, but finds Brielle's body in her room, killed the exact way another Dillon citizen proposed. Finally, he realizes that his theory was backwards: Attina isn't forcing the townspeople to murder, the townspeople's dark desires are driving Attina to action ‚Äì and John himself started it all with his murderous thoughts. He finds the demon in a farmhouse outside of the town, mirroring Brooke's inclination to kill herself, and helps Attina start the fire that serves as its suicide. Once it is all over, John takes Brooke back to their hometown of Clayton to be with her parents and get the care she needs. She protests and wants to stay with him, asserting that she loves him. John loves both her and Marci, tells her so, and leaves the town still unable to forgive himself for getting both girls involved in his supernatural war in the first place.  Reception  Reviews of Over Your Dead Body were mostly complimentary; the majority of reviewers thought it a worthy addition to Wells's series. A San Francisco Book Review writer approved of the continuation of John's story and called the novel \\"an intriguingly fabulous mix of serial killer horror, supernatural beings, and dark humor.\\" Alternative Magazine Online's review echoed similar ideas, saying: \\"Over Your Dead Body is yet another superb installment in the John Wayne Cleaver series that echoes the delightful eeriness of the earlier books while exploring exciting new territory.\\" Publishers Weekly called the novel a \\"strong fifth entry\\" that proved to be \\"much richer than a simple monster vs. monster story.\\" David Pitt for Booklist wrote: \\"For fans of the series, the book is a superlative must- read, although newcomers should probably start at the beginning. Still, this one‚Äôs very fine indeed.\\"  Awards and nominations  * 2016 AML Award for Best Novel * 2016 Whitney Award finalist for Speculative Fiction * 2016 Goodreads Choice Award nominee for Horror  See also  * I Am Not a Serial Killer * I Am Not a Serial Killer (film) * Mr. Monster * I Don't Want to Kill You  References  External links  * Author's website * Dan Wells papers at L.

History and description Saint Joseph's Church was built of reinforced concrete in 1969 with a fa√ßade of well-hewn stone from Stubllava√ß√´, the same source used for Saint Anthony of Padua‚Äôs church in Binaƒç. The fa√ßade stones are sloped and tinted gray, and the edifice is topped with a Latin cross inscribed as follows: Martir√´t tan√´ 1846‚Äì1848 (‚ÄúOur martyrs 1846‚Äì1848‚Äù). The church is triangular, featuring a nave from transept to apse and two side naves with no apse. The apse is pentagonal on the exterior, with two corners facing inward and three facing out. Patterns from older early Christian churches, in which side naves were lower than the main one, are reversed here with the main nave at the lowest level. The naves are divided by square pillars with no arcades, giving the church's ceiling the appearance of a coffin. The entrance includes an open porch, behind which a small corridor with windows and three doors lead to the chapel. The main entrance is used most often in wedding and communion ceremonies, while the side ones are separated by gender for parishioners, the right for men and the left for women. The three naves where the pews stand each end with one major feature of the church. The main one leads to the chancel, the right to the baptistery, and the left to the pulpit, as in St. Anthony's of Binaƒç. The central altar includes relics and is emblazoned with an engraved \\"M,\\" which like the cross commemorates the Expulsion of Karadak, an 1846‚Äì1848 atrocity in which Catholic Albanians were expelled from four villages by troops of the Ottoman Empire and forced to resettle in Turkey, many dying along the way. Four pilasters symbolize the villages, namely Stubbla proper, Binaƒç, V√´rnakolla, and Terziaj. An improvised two-part base holds the priest's chair, and others are nearby for deacons and to hold communion wafers. In each of two corners of the altar room lays a slab over four grooved pillars. Above the left slab is a depiction of Our Lady of Lourdes and a worshipper, while above the right slab is a carving of the church's patron Saint Joseph. Two side entrances lead to different rooms, one for the priest and one for attendants, each with entryways to the outside. The church choir and orchestra sit on the floor opposite the apse. A choir is raised 30 cm above the floor and includes stairs of four different types of wood. Iron stairs lead there from the right entrance of the chapel. The apse walls include notable murals: the front depicts the Last Supper, the right wall Calvary, and the left is used with the right to form a diptych about the Expulsion. 14 framed figures depict the Stations of the Cross. The apse ceiling is engraved with a Latin cross and illuminated by its own windows. Eight windows from all four sides of the naves light up the chapel. An altarpiece in front of the right nave was taken from Saint Anne's Church in Dunav, Gjilan, which today lacks worshipers. The left nave is fronted by a mural of Jesus. The integrated bell tower has three rows of windows where it rises up. The first row includes two windows on each of the four sides, while the other two rows have each add one more per side. The belfry ends includes several points, the highest of them being the cross. The church lies on a gentle hill with a well-arranged churchyard of trees, greens, and cobblestone walkways.

She is known, in particular, for her mural reliefs.  Life  Magdalene \\"Ebbi\\" Kre√üner was born in Schweizerthal near Chemnitz. As a child she was initially sent to a boarding school, but she hated it. Eventually her parents were persuaded to send her to the \\"Alte Kunstschule Richter\\" (Art School) in Dresden where her love of art was awakened. She became determined to become a painter (and at the same time to avoid getting \\"side-tracked into sculpture\\"). Between 1921 and 1927 she studied with Wilhelm Gerstel at the Berlin- Charlottenburg Arts Academy (as it was known at that time). She then switched to the Academy of Fine Arts in Dresden where between 1927 and 1930 she was a \\"Meistersch√ºlerin\\" (loosely, \\"master student\\") of Karl Albiker. Magdalene Kre√üner supported herself as a freelance artist in Dresden between 1930 and 1945. On 13 February 1945 her studio was destroyed in the firestorm and bombing inflicted on the central part of the city by the English and the Americans. She also lost her home. Following the destruction she ended at Oberl√∂√ünitz which by this time had been subsumed - formally in 1934 - into Radebeul, a short distance down-river from Dresden, where she made her home at Eduard-Bilz-Stra√üe 42, and where she lived for the rest of her life, in a home that was large enough to incorporate the little studio in which she now worked. Because her early work was destroyed in the bombing, Magdalene Kre√üner is chiefly known for the work she produced between 1945 and 1975. During this time the central portion of Germany, including Dresden and the surrounding region, was administered as the Soviet occupation zone, relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). The mural reliefs on public buildings for which she would be remembered reflect the style associated with East German public art. Many have themes drawn from classical mythology or from the Christian bible. Among her better known works is the oak crucifixion group produced during 1955/56 for the \\"Luther Cemetery\\" at Radebeul. In the judgement of one commentator, it combines content and form with subtle empathy. Other important works include \\"Drei Generationen\\" (\\"Three generations - 1967\\"). which is currently part of the Dresden State Art Collection. Kre√üner also produced illustrations for various children's books and, notably, for an early edition of Thomas Mann's vast four-part novel, Joseph and His Brothers.

Reid's election in October 1971 came during his attempt to save jobs at the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders, threatened by cuts in government subsidies. The address was delivered on 28 April 1972 to students and the university court in Bute Hall. Reid's subject was Marx's theory of alienation and he used the example of the modernisation of the Clyde shipyards which he considered risked breaking the pride workers had in their products. In one famous passage he lamented the \\"scrambling for position\\" in modern society and stated that the \\"rat race is for rats. We're not rats. We're human beings\\". The speech was reprinted in full by the New York Times and has since been referred to as one of the most outstanding speeches of the 20th century. It raised Reid's profile and led to a number of national television appearances.  Background  Shipbuilding cranes on the Clyde Jimmy Reid was an Amalgamated Engineering Union leader and member of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). As a worker at the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS), an amalgamation of five separate companies in the historic shipbuilding area of Clydeside in Glasgow, Reid opposed the proposed withdrawal of subsidies by Edward Heath's Conservative ministry. This would have led to the closure of most of the business and the loss of 6,000 of the 8,500 employees. Reid and other union leaders led a work-in, an alternative to the strike where the employees continued to come to work without pay to demonstrate the productivity of the yards. The work-in was well run and eventually led to the business being restructured around two of the main yards, Govan Shipbuilders and Scotstoun Marine Ltd (a third, Yarrow Shipbuilders Limited had previously been separated from UCS). During the period of the work-in an election was held for the position of Rector of the University of Glasgow. The rector is the students' representative to the university authorities and is elected by the student body on a triennial basis. The position was often filled by an establishment figure, often a peer or leading politician, and the outgoing rector was George MacLeod, Baron MacLeod of Fuinary. Reid had no prior involvement with the university which was traditionally middle-class and conservative in leaning, it was not a member of the National Union of Students at the time as they were considered too left wing. However, Reid considered that an election campaign would provide good publicity for his UCS campaign. Reid's opponents in the election were former Labour minister Peggy Herbison; local Conservative MP and former minister Teddy Taylor; Liverpool poet Roger McGough and television personality Michael Parkinson. McGough and Parkinson were eliminated before the poll due to errors in their nomination paperwork. Reid stood on a platform of greater student involvement in the running of the university and promised a student assistant would be appointed to help present issues to senior management. Reid was largely absent from the campaign, owing to his commitments at the UCS work-in. He had less to spend on marketing than the other candidates but his campaign may have been helped by his frequent television and radio appearances during this time. Reid was elected in October 1971 with 1,458 votes to 891 for Taylor and 810 for Herbison. The Glasgow student president Martin Caldwell hailed the result as \\"a victory for the ordinary people of Clydeside against paternalism, academic snobbery, and the present government\\" that showed that the Glasgow students, many of whom came from the city, cared for the plight of UCS workers. The result was covered in the press which helped boost morale at the work-in and improve Reid's public image. His inaugural speech was not due until April 1972 and in the meantime Reid successfully concluded the UCS work-in and helped resolve student issues, such as the eviction of a group of five undergraduates from their hall of residence in February.  Speech  The former RMS Queen Elizabeth, wrecked in Victoria Harbour Reid's inaugural address would take place in Glasgow University's Bute Hall on 28 April 1972, this was the same day as the government approved the rescue deal for UCS. Reid wrote his speech himself the day before the event whereas some previous rectors had employed professional speechwriters. The address formed part of a grand ceremony with the university court present and academic dress being worn. Reid wore the rector's robe and, for the first time in his life, white tie. Some disruption was caused when two students dressed as a pink pantomime horse attempted to enter the hall but otherwise Reid was not interrupted during his address, except for rounds of applause from the audience. Reid spoke in his usual working-class Clydeside accent and presented his address as a reasoned argument not as a rabble- rousing speech. At its conclusion Reid received a two-minute standing ovation. Reid's address was entitled \\"Alienation\\" and its primary subject was Marx's theory of alienation. Marx describes social alienation as a consequence of the capitalist system of production which seeks to divide society between professions and remove the individual's connection to the product of their labour. Marx thought alienation led to workers having little understanding, control or influence of the world in which they lived, leading to indifference and passivity. The exterior of Bute Hall Reid had been inspired to write on the subject of alienation after witnessing, in Connolly's Bar in Glasgow, the tearful reaction of shipyard workers to news of the sinking of the Clyde-built Seawise University (the former RMS Queen Elizabeth) in Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour on 9 January 1972. Reid thought that recent modernisation of industrial practices and the purchase of Scottish shipbuilders by English and foreign companies would lead to a loss of such a connection between workers and their products. Reid considered that the new shipyard owners lacked knowledge of the long history of shipbuilding in Scotland and were focused only on the economic benefits of largescale production and centralisation. Though he framed his argument with reference to the shipbuilding industry Reid's address had a broader application to society as a whole. Reid stated in his address that a lack of social support by the government exacerbated alienation and its effects on young people led to anti-social behaviour and the use of drink and drugs. Reid decried a modern society that promoted \\"scrambling for position, trampling on others, back-stabbing, all in the pursuit of success\\" and called on students to reject this, stating \\"a rat race is for rats. We're not rats. We're human beings\\". He cautioned them that the cost of participation in such a society was the \\"loss of your dignity and human spirit\\" and quoted Christ: \\"what doth it profit a man if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul?\\". Reid called for greater involvement of the people in decision making at all levels, comparing the \\"untapped resources\\" of people to those of the North Sea oil fields. Reid lamented wasted potential saying \\"I am convinced that the great mass of our people go through life without even a glimmer of what they could have contributed to their fellow human beings. This is a personal tragedy. It is a social crime. The flowering of each individual‚Äôs personality and talents is the precondition for everyone‚Äôs development\\". Reid warned his audience not to hate the capitalists who he stated were also a product of the alienation in society. Reid's biographers William Knox and Adam McKinlay state that the address had a liberal, middle-class and almost Victorian tone in the way it espouses the virtues of public service. They note he references the Christian religion, Marx and even Joseph Heller's Catch-22 and may have been inspired by the works of William Morris, that he studied in his youth. Throughout Reid used \\"we\\" as a mark of inclusivity and collective spirit, though he characterises the struggle against alienation as an individual contest. A few months after making the address Reid was approached by the psychiatrist R. D. Laing who praised the speech and asked him what research he had carried out to prepare for it. Reid replied that his only research was his working life spent on the Clydeside.  Impact  The ceiling of Bute Hall The speech was reprinted in full in The New York Times which hailed it as the \\"greatest speech since President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address\\". In Glasgow newspaper the Evening Times it was afforded only 57 lines and placed lower in prominence than the council's plan to invest in a radio station and a bus that crashed into a tree. The Evening Times article was headlined \\"I have a dream by Rector Jim Reid\\", despite the fact that Reid never went by \\"Jim\\". The Glasgow Herald mentioned the speech in its editorial. The coverage helped raise Reid's profile, to the highest levels of his career, and led to appearances on national television such as Open to Question in May 1972 and A Chance to Meet in November. Reid stood for the CPGB in Central Dunbartonshire (which included Clydeside) in the February and October 1974 general elections, losing decisively to the Labour candidate both times. His 3-year term as rector ended in 1974 and he was replaced by Arthur Montford, a football commentator. Reid later moved away from the communists and joined Labour, for which he unsuccessfully stood in Dundee East in 1979. He afterwards presented a series of BAFTA-winning documentaries about the USSR on Grampian Television. He became disillusioned with New Labour and, in 2005, joined the Scottish National Party. He died in 2010. Reid's speech was criticised by some Trotskyist opponents, including Stephen Johns of the Socialist Labour League who stated: \\"this could be one of these speeches by the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Duke of Edinburgh or even a Tory. After all we are all against the \\"rat race\\", and it would be nice if the ordinary bloke got a bit more say in things ‚Äì make him feel wanted. It is noticeable that the 'communist' Reid censored all mention of capitalism, the working class, revolutionary change and socialism\\". Others praised the address which was described as poetic and demonstrating Reid's intelligence. CPGB leaders praised the speech and Alex Murray told the party's Scottish Congress: \\"Previous Rectors, among them Gladstone, Disraeli and Sir Robert Peel, must be spinning in their graves. Let them turn. Let them gyrate. Go into orbit if they will. It matters not as they represent the past ... that which [Reid] represents; those whom he represents ‚Äì our Part, our ideas and our ideals, the working class, the youth, represent ... Scotland's future\\". After Reid's death the address was referred to as \\"a working-class hero's finest speech\\" by The Independent and the writer Kenneth Roy regarded it as \\"one of the outstanding speeches of the 20th century\\". Scottish Labour Party Leader Iain Gray described the address as \\"one of the finest political speeches of the 1970s\\" and the most famous portion, the phrase \\"a rat race is for rats\\", is still quoted widely decades later.

Based on the character of the same name, she is portrayed by Kirsten Dunst. In the films, Mary Jane is Peter Parker's next-door neighbor, childhood crush, and primary love interest. Though Mary Jane dates several other men in the first two films, she ultimately falls in love with Peter and Spider-Man and discovers they are one and the same. Despite his strong feelings for her, Peter initially declines a relationship with her in order to keep her safe, but they eventually become a couple in the end. Despite being portrayed as a damsel in distress throughout the film series, Dunst's interpretation of the character has been generally well-received. Character design and portrayal=Comic book origins Mary Jane Watson was first introduced into Spider-Man comics story-lines in The Amazing Spider-Man #42 in 1966, despite being mentioned earlier in the comics. She was conceived as competition to Gwen Stacy as Spider-Man's primary love interest, and is characterized as a free- spirited, outgoing personality as opposed to Gwen's more serious, academic nature. Peter Parker initially dates Gwen after he stops going out with Mary Jane due to what he sees as her shallow personality while Mary Jane refuses to be tied down in one relationship. Despite this, Mary Jane became more popular with fans and following Gwen's death in the comics, Peter and MJ begin to rekindle their relationship and eventually marry despite ups and downs in the comics. Casting and execution Actress Kirsten Dunst was cast as Mary Jane Watson for the 2002 Spider-Man film, with Mary Jane having been cemented in comics lore as Peter Parker's primary love interest by then. Before director Sam Raimi cast Dunst, he had expressed his interest in casting Alicia Witt. Dunst decided to audition after learning Tobey Maguire had been cast as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, feeling the film would have a more independent feel. Dunst earned the role a month before shooting in an audition in Berlin. In the first two films in the trilogy, Dunst wore a red wig for the part, dying part of her hair in the first film, before dying her full head of blond hair red for the third film. Dunst was also allegedly asked to change her teeth for the films, a demand that she refused. She also declined to do certain stunts in the films. The set-up for Spider-Man and Mary Jane's famous \\"upside-down kiss\\" involved several rain-machines at the studio lot, and saw some difficulty as Maguire was hung upside down with water pouring into his nostrils. To achieve the look of Mary Jane pulling Spider-Man's mask down, Dunst was described by Sam Raimi as \\"doing some hand trickery\\" as the mask was not pliable in those conditions. Having initially signed on for three Spider-Man films, Dunst said that she would consider doing a fourth, but only if Raimi and Maguire also returned. In January 2010, it was announced that the fourth film was cancelled and that the Spider-Man film series would be restarted, and therefore dropping the trio from the franchise. Kirsten Dunst in 2006 Characterization and themes As portrayed in the Sam Raimi trilogy, Mary Jane Watson is a kind, funny, beautiful, sweet, cheerful, passionate, and energetic young woman who is an aspiring actress. She runs with the stereotypical popular crowd in school, being surrounded by people who have enticing physical features and great skills in ways of performing arts or sports. Mary Jane is somewhat naive, but always knows what's going on. While individuals in MJ's high school clique are rude, snobbish, arrogant, vain and uncaring, Mary Jane is a loyal friend and a warm individual, capable of intense love and real feelings. Mary Jane does not let the attention she gets from boys get to her head. Instead, she uses her looks merely as an advantage for acting and modelling and works to develop independence and smarts. Despite her popularity, MJ struggles with insecurity and an urge to impress people she deems important, both of which most likely come from her abusive father, and is an indecisive dater before Peter finally commits to her. She also deals with the harsh reality of being an actress and has her own struggles in each film. She never bullies or judges Peter Parker and is friendly towards him, despite him being in the unpopular crowd, and even flirts with him and calls him \\"Tiger\\" (an homage to her catchphrase in the comics).The Amazing Spider-Man #42 (November 1966) MJ generally has no one treat her with respect for anything other than her looks, which she may not have noticed until after high school graduation, before she and Peter develop a stronger friendship. It is quite possibly because of this, Mary Jane becomes so smitten by Spider-Man so quickly and later falls for Peter (oblivious that they are one and the same) as he is very kind to her other than just for her looks. After her kiss with Spider-Man, MJ was shown to be a great deal happier and almost ecstatic, because it had perhaps been her first kiss with someone who loved her back for more than just aesthetic reasons. Unfortunately, her involvement with Spider-Man also makes her a common target by his enemies, making her require his rescue in all three films, as noted by Emily Kubincanek of Film School Rejects. Writing in 2020 after the release of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, Adadora Asidianya of CBR.com looked back at Mary Jane's live-action portrayal in the Raimi films and noted that she provides a grounding presence for Peter in the films, also commending her positive outlook in life despite her toxic upbringings. Film appearances=Spider-Man (2002) Mary Jane first appears as Peter Parker narrates the first few minutes of the film. She is depicted as a popular girl at Midtown High School and the girlfriend of star athlete Flash Thompson, while Peter, her next-door neighbor who has had a crush on her since they were in first grade, is an academically gifted but shy outsider. Peter struggles to catch the school bus until MJ asks the driver to stop for him. Later, their class attends a field trip to a lab at Columbia University. Peter's friend Harry Osborn flirts with Mary Jane before Peter takes a picture of her for the school newspaper, after which a genetically-altered spider bites him, ultimately giving him his abilities. Peter then saves MJ from slipping in the school cafeteria with his new abilities the next day and inadvertently triggers a fight with Flash, though he is able to easily dodge Flash's punches and knocks him out with one punch with MJ and other students watching. Peter later apologizes to MJ for the fight while she confides in him about wanting to escape her abusive, alcoholic father. She later breaks up with Flash during high school graduation and takes up work as a waitress while looking for acting gigs. While she starts dating Harry, she and Peter begin to form a closer friendship. Peter rescues her as Spider-Man when the Green Goblin attacks a parade she was attending with Harry, and again later on from a gang in an alley. Mary Jane thanks Spider-Man with a kiss without him revealing his identity. She also subsequently develops feelings for Peter when she realizes how much he cares for her, causing Harry to break up with her upon seeing MJ and Peter holding hands. Once Harry confides to his father about this, Norman, who is the Green Goblin and having deduced Peter is Spider-Man, kidnaps Mary Jane upon realizing Peter loves her. The Goblin forces Peter to choose between saving Mary Jane and a Roosevelt Island Tramway car full of children, all of whom he holds hostage alongside the Queensboro Bridge. Peter opts to save both, and despite a struggle, manages to lower MJ and the kids onto a boat, after which the Goblin whisks Spider-Man away for a final confrontation which results in the Goblin's death. At Norman's funeral, Mary Jane tells Peter that she loves him and they kiss. Peter, who decides that for her protection they can't be together, gently rejects her and insists they can only be friends. As he leaves, a saddened Mary Jane realizes that her kiss with Peter reminds her of the one she shared with Spider-Man and suspects that he is the superhero. Spider-Man 2 (2004) Two years after the events of the first movie, Mary Jane has found success as a model and Broadway theater actress. Maintaining her friendships with both Peter and Harry, she continues to pine for Peter, but as he continues to reject her, she starts dating astronaut John Jameson, the son of Peter's boss J. Jonah Jameson. Struggling to balance his vigilantism as Spider-Man with his personal life, Peter fails to make it to one of Mary Jane's performances of The Importance of Being Earnest when all her other friends and even her father have made it. Fed up with being Spider- Man, Peter tosses his suit away and is able to handle his job and studies and decides to pursue MJ, though she pushes him away when John proposes to her. After Mary Jane kisses John, in a manner that is reminiscent of the upside- down kiss between her and Spider-Man from the first film, she realizes that she does not love John and still wants a relationship with Peter. Later, she meets Peter in a coffee shop where she asks for a kiss to confirm her belief that he is Spider-Man. She even asks him if he loves her which he falsely replies, \\"I don't\\", for the sake of his superhero responsibilities and her safety. Before they can kiss, Doctor Octopus attacks the cafe, coercing Peter to find Spider-Man and kidnapping Mary Jane. Peter regains his abilities and takes up being the web-slinger once more, fighting Doc Ock on a runaway New York City Subway train before being subdued and delivered to Harry, who wants revenge on Spider-Man for allegedly killing his father. After Harry unmasks Peter, he reluctantly provides Doc Ock's and Mary Jane's location so Peter can save her. Peter defeats Doctor Octopus this time as the latter tries to create a fusion reactor capable of destroying the city, and unmasks himself to both Doctor Octopus and MJ, who realizes Peter and Spider-Man are in fact one and the same. Peter finally confesses his love for MJ, rescuing her as Doctor Octopus repents of his prior actions and sacrifices himself to destroy the reactor. Peter explains his reasoning for not being with her, then allows her to reunite with John. However, MJ leaves John at the altar during their wedding and runs to Peter's apartment, stating that she is willing to accept any risks that come with being in a relationship with Peter. The two finally become a couple, and Mary Jane sees Peter off as he swings into action as Spider-Man to help out a situation, uttering her catchphrase \\"Go get 'em, Tiger!\\" Spider-Man 3 (2007) Having dated Peter for one year, Mary Jane experiences some struggles in the film in a similar fashion as Peter in Spider-Man 2, losing her acting job because of bad reviews and experiencing friction with her boyfriend when an alien symbiote takes him over and brings out the darker parts of his personality. She also faces competition for Peter's affections in the form of his lab partner Gwen Stacy. After she confides in Harry about her problems, Harry, who had suffered amnesia from a prior fight with Peter as the New Goblin, regains his memories and manipulates MJ into breaking up with Peter, setting up a second confrontation between the two former friends which leaves Harry's face disfigured. Peter, now under more influence from the symbiote, later brings Gwen to a jazz club where MJ has found work in an attempt to make her jealous, though Gwen catches on and apologizes to Mary Jane. He then gets into a fight with the club's bouncers and unintentionally hits Mary Jane, leading him to realize what he has become. He leaves and disposes of the symbiote suit, which unintentionally falls onto Gwen's failed suitor Eddie Brock to create Venom. Brock, who also holds a grudge on Peter, finds out his secret identity, teaming up with Flint Marko to lure and kill Spider-Man, capturing MJ as bait. The subsequent battle pits Spider-Man and the New Goblin (who no longer begrudges Peter after discovering the truth about his father's death) against Venom and the Sandman; the two villains are defeated, but Harry loses his life in the process, dying at MJ and Peter's side after taking a blade intended for Peter. Sometime after Harry's funeral, Peter arrives at MJ's jazz club, and the two begin to mend their relationship, sharing a dance. In other media=Television *Mary Jane also appears in Spider-Man: The New Animated Series, a CGI-animated television series serving as a loose continuation of the first Spider-Man film and taking place two years before Spider-Man 2. She, Peter and Harry attend Empire State University together, and she attempts to start a relationship with Peter without much success. Mary Jane is voiced by Lisa Loeb. Video games *Mary Jane Watson appears in all three video game adaptations of the films. While she is voiced by Cat O'Conner in the first game, Kirsten Dunst reprises her role in a vocal capacity in the second game while Kari Wahlgren takes over the role in the third game. *This version of Mary Jane is indirectly mentioned in Spider-Man: Friend or Foe. Near the end of the game's epilogue, Nick Fury tells Spider-Man that after helping find all the missing meteorites, he should instead take a short break and do other fun activities, such as taking his girlfriend out for dinner. Reception and legacy Kirsten Dunst's portrayal of Mary Jane Watson in the Spider-Man films was generally well-received, as she was nominated for several awards for her performance, winning four, including the Empire Award for Best Actress in 2003. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly remarked on Dunst's ability to \\"lend even the smallest line a tickle of flirtatious music\\". In the Los Angeles Times review, critic Kenneth Turan noted that Dunst and Maguire made a real connection on screen, concluding that their relationship \\"involved audiences to an extent rarely seen in films\\". However, there has been some criticism of a lack of character development. In his review of Spider-Man 3, Ryan Gilbey of the NewStatesman was critical of Dunst's character: \\"the film-makers couldn't come up with much for Mary Jane to do other than scream a lot\\". Allie Gemmill of Bustle wrote in 2017 that the films portray Mary Jane as a constant damsel in distress and gave the illusion that she was defined primarily through the men in her life. Conversely, Adadora Asidianya wrote that Mary Jane provides a voice of reason for Peter, whether as a friend or a love interest. Spider-Man and Mary Jane's \\"upside-down kiss\\" in Spider-Man is now regarded as one of the most iconic moments in film history. Entertainment Weekly put \\"the kiss in Spider-Man\\" on its end-of-the-decade \\"best-of\\" list, saying: \\"There's a fine line between romantic and corny. And the rain-soaked smooch between Spider-Man and Mary Jane from 2002 tap-dances right on that line. The reason it works? Even if she suspects he's Peter Parker, she doesn't try to find out. And that's sexy.\\" References 50px The plot description and characterization were adapted from Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), Spider-Man (film), Spider- Man 2, and Spider-Man 3 at Spider-Man films Wiki and Mary Jane Watson (Earth-96283) at Marvel Movies Wiki, which are available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 (Unported) (CC-BY-SA 3.0) license.

However, this amnesty did not include Shi Xuan's guards who were exiled to Liangzhou after his execution. In response, their captain Liang Du (Ê¢ÅÁä¢) rebelled and they marched towards Luoyang, defeating the Later Zhao generals in their way.

Based on the character of the same name, he is portrayed by James Franco. In the films, Harry is Peter Parker's best friend and a rival for Mary Jane Watson's affections, though the three are friends for much of the series. Harry and Peter's friendship sours after the death of Harry's father, Norman Osborn, who was the Green Goblin, which he blames on Spider-Man. Upon finding out his best friend is actually the web-slinger, Harry vows revenge on Peter, taking on the New Goblin mantle and utilizing the technology his father left behind. Franco's portrayal of Harry Osborn catapulted the actor to wider mainstream exposure as one of his first major film roles. He was nominated for four awards for his performance in Spider-Man 3. Following the Spider-Man films' reboot, the part of Harry was recast to Dane DeHaan in Marc Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Character design and portrayal=Comics origin and casting for Sam Raimi's films First appearing in The Amazing Spider-Man #31, Harry Osborn is depicted as the wealthy son of Norman Osborn, with his mother presumably dying at a young age. Harry and Peter Parker gradually become close friends after meeting in college, despite initially not getting along and battling over girls such as Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson. Harry struggles to gain his father's approval, who is constantly at work, and becomes jealous of Norman becoming fond of Peter. After Mary Jane dumps him, he becomes addicted to drugs. He initially does not know his father becomes the Green Goblin while his best friend is actually Spider-Man. Harry takes on the Green Goblin persona and technology after his father's death, which he blames on Spider-Man and in turn Peter, and is influenced by hallucinations of his father to kill Peter, but sacrifices himself to save Peter, Mary Jane, and his son. Since dying in The Spectacular Spider-Man #200, Harry, like his father and Gwen Stacy, has since been resurrected or re-adapted into different forms in the comics. James Franco was cast as Harry for the 2002 Spider-Man film. Originally, Franco was considered for the lead role of Spider-Man/Peter Parker in the film before Tobey Maguire won the role, but upon seeing Franco's audition, Raimi's wife thought that Franco was perfect for the role of Harry. In a review of the first film, Todd McCarthy of Variety noted that there were \\"good moments\\" between Maguire and Franco. However, due to an off-hand remark that Franco made towards Maguire, a real-life feud emerged between the two actors for some time. In Spider-Man 3, shooting was difficult for cinematographer Bill Pope during fight scenes that take place at night, as the symbiote Spider-Man, Venom, and the New Goblin were all costumed in black for those scenes. Upon Harry taking on his father's mantle and using leftover equipment, Harry's suit and glider have been modified, possibly due to the backlash that the original Green Goblin suit received in the first film. Instead of using a bulky helmet, the New Goblin uses a mask resembling a ski mask with goggles, and his glider, nicknamed the Sky Stick in the film's promotional materials, resembles a snowboard. Characterization and themes As depicted in the Sam Raimi film series, Harry is a good man and a loyal friend, having always considered the nerdy Peter Parker his best friend and protected him in high school, which closely resembles their relationship in the Ultimate Spider-Man comics. In addition, he never allowed his wealth to make him spoiled or arrogant early in the series. However, he is also prone to stress, depression and obsession, and his obsession to please his father strains his judgement and relationships, including treating his then-girlfriend Mary Jane Watson as a trophy to impress his father, and developing a jealousy towards his best friend, Peter. After his father's death, Harry becomes obsessed with Spider-Man, and develops a strong vendetta upon him. The \\"New Goblin\\" persona adapted in Spider-Man 3 is the embodiment of Harry Osborn's hatred towards Spider-Man and only exists for completing his vendetta. But after Harry comes to terms with his misguided hatred and his friendship with Peter, with no more doubts, he reconciles with his best friend and the two form an effective team fighting against adversaries. In an analysis of the leading male figures in Spider-Man, including Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker and Willem Dafoe's Norman Osborn, James Whitbroook of Gizmodo writes that Harry is initially reluctant to bask in the Osborn name, hiding from public view while riding with his father in their limousine and resisting the urge to become spoiled by his inheritance, though he almost immediately takes advantage of Peter's bookish nature to flirt with Mary Jane, his best friend's crush, using a trivia bit that Peter brings up to impress her. Harry eventually gives in to using the Osborn name due to what it brings to him, eventually gambling on an ill-fated experiment experiment by Dr. Otto Octavius in Spider-Man 2 in an attempt to gain more power and influence rather than to benefit those around him. Harry is under the impression that his father was a good man killed by Spider-Man, and upon discovering his father's stash of weaponry, uses it to try and get revenge on Spider-Man, even after he discovers that Peter, his best friend, is actually Spider-Man. Sam Raimi felt that Harry would not follow his father's legacy upon becoming the new Green Goblin, but be instead \\"somewhere between.\\" Despite this, Raimi wanted the conflict between Harry and Peter to be resolved by the end of Spider-Man 3. Film appearances=Spider-Man (2002) Harry first appears riding with his father Norman Osborn in their limousine as Norman drops Harry off for a school field trip. The film establishes that Harry had flunked out of numerous private schools, forcing his enrollment at Midtown High School, and that Harry and Norman have a somewhat strained relationship. Upon seeing his best friend Peter Parker, Harry introduces him to his father, who immediately takes a liking to Peter. Norman later attends their graduation and congratulates Harry, also taking time to console Peter for the loss of his uncle and warmly accepting him as a brother figure to Harry and thus a part of their family. At the same time, Harry notices that Mary Jane Watson, Peter's childhood crush, had broken up with her boyfriend Flash Thompson. Some time after the end of school, Harry and Peter live together in a large apartment bought by Norman. Harry starts a relationship with Mary Jane, initially without telling Peter, who later finds out from MJ that the two are dating but hides his disappointment. Harry and MJ have an important date at a fair sponsored by his father's company Oscorp, where the flaws of their relationship are shown: Harry wants to impress his father with MJ, and MJ is evidently not truly interested in him. The couple, along with the whole Oscorp board, are suddenly attacked by the Green Goblin, a homicidal criminal who, unbeknownst to Harry, is actually Norman with an insane second personality due to an experiment gone wrong. Harry attempts to save MJ from falling down from a terrace, but is knocked out by falling debris, and she is instead saved by Spider-Man. On Thanksgiving, Harry tries again to present his girlfriend to his father during dinner with Peter and his Aunt May, but Norman, who discovers that Peter is Spider-Man, suddenly leaves in a hurry. Harry pleads with him to stay for dinner with him and Mary Jane, but Norman uncharacteristically insults MJ, ordering his son to dump her as soon as he is satisfied with her, and then storms off. Harry is saddened by the lack of attention by his father, and, to make it worse, MJ overhears Norman and calls him a creep, and an angry Harry defends him, saying that the \\"creep\\" was his father. While Aunt May is in hospital after being attacked by the Goblin, Harry goes to visit her, but finds Peter and MJ getting intimate with each other. With his feelings hurt, Harry goes to his father, telling him he was right about everything, MJ included, and unwillingly reveals to the Goblin Spider-Man's true weakness: Mary Jane. The Green Goblin uses this to bait Spider-Man into another fight by kidnapping MJ, but is killed by his own glider after attempting to kill Spider-Man. Following Norman's last wish to not let Harry know about his villainous split-personality, Spider-Man removes the Goblin's costume and returns Norman's body to the Osborn mansion, but Harry walks in. Distraught and assuming it was Spider-Man who killed Norman, Harry tries to shoot the hero, but Spider-Man vanishes. During Norman's funeral, Harry swears vengeance towards Spider-Man, but expresses his gratitude that Peter is the only family he has left. Spider-Man 2 (2004) After Norman's death, Harry takes over Oscorp. He remains good friends with Peter, and at Peter's birthday party, offers to introduce Peter to his idol, Dr. Otto Octavius, whose research Harry is funding. Peter is, however, still fearful of how delicate his friendship with Harry has become because of Harry's vendetta against Spider-Man. Harry provides Octavius with tritium, a very rare form of hydrogen which Octavius needs for his nuclear fusion experiment. If the experiment succeeds, Oscorp would gain the rights on a new kind of energy source, making it one of the most important, powerful and rich energy companies in the world. However, during a live demonstration of the fusion, the experiment fails, and the resulting explosion permanently attaches four extendable robotic arms onto Octavius, who is taken to the hospital and later escapes, becoming the villainous \\"Doctor Octopus\\". Emotionally destroyed by the failure, Harry starts drinking heavily and focuses his anger onto Spider-Man. During a party, Harry gets drunk and starts lashing out at Peter, resenting him for being his father's favorite, accusing him of protecting Spider-Man for the profit of taking Spider-Man's newspaper photos and for \\"stealing\\" Mary Jane. During the argument, Harry slaps Peter, humiliating them both in public. His hatred towards Spider-Man goes so far that, when Doctor Octopus arrives at his mansion demanding more tritium, he makes a deal with him: the tritium in exchange of Spider-Man's capture. When Doc Ock asks him how can he find the hero, Harry instructs him to use Peter Parker, who takes pictures of Spider-Man. After kidnapping Mary Jane and a long battle, Octavius delivers Spider-Man to Harry and leaves with his tritium. Armed with a knife, Harry then proceeds to unmask the hero. He is shocked when he realized that his worst enemy was actually his best friend, but he reveals Doc Ock's whereabouts to Peter, who leaves to rescue Mary Jane. Still in shock, Harry sees visions of his father's ghost, who encourages his revenge towards Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Harry is reluctant to hurt his friend and struggles against Norman's will, trying to make the ghost go away; throwing a knife through the mirror in which Norman appears, Harry shatters it and discovers the Green Goblin's secret hideout, with all his weaponry and equipment. Now, Harry has both the motives and the tools for his revenge. Harry is later seen at Mary Jane and John Jameson's botched wedding as a guest. Harry in action as the \\"New Goblin\\", as seen in Spider-Man 3 Spider-Man 3 (2007) By the events of the third movie, Harry brushes off Peter's attempts to talk to him and explain the truth of Norman's death, and eventually opts to use a refined version of his father's performance-enhancing formula, utilizing his father's equipment as well. After Peter leaves a date with Mary Jane, Harry ambushes him as the New Goblin, intent on exacting revenge for his father's death. The skirmish results in Harry getting knocked out cold and suffering amnesia after Peter sets a trap for him. Recovering in the hospital, Harry forgets everything about his vendetta, Spider-Man and the Goblin. He also re-embraces Peter and Mary Jane as his best friends, seemingly with his life finally at peace. Harry, having forgotten taking the Goblin Serum, is surprised by his enhanced physical capacities, such as his incredibly sharp reflexes. When Peter starts distancing himself from his friends and focusing on his late uncle's recently revealed killer, Mary Jane is depressed over her lost acting career and finds solace with Harry. Harry welcomes her into his home, and they bond with each other, seemingly becoming closer than their previous dating relationship. After she unwittingly kisses him and rushes away regretting it, the sudden surge of familiar stress unlocks Harry's memories and restored his vendetta. Again haunted by his father's ghost, who gives him advice on emotional war, Harry decides to hurt Peter through Mary Jane and, after threatening her, forces her to break up with Peter, leaving Peter heartbroken. Later, Harry encounters Peter in a caf√© and declares to him that he is MJ's new boyfriend. Realizing Harry's plot against him, Peter goes to the Osborn mansion, now armed with the aggression-inducing symbiote costume, and a new hatred for his old best friend, engaging Harry in a brutal fist-fight. Harry is defeated and insulted by Peter, and when he tries to hit Peter with a pumpkin bomb, Peter effortlessly slings the bomb back at his face and leaves, turning his back on the completely defeated Harry. After Peter realizes the symbiote's effects on him and his relationships, he gets rid of the suit, only for it to fall onto Eddie Brock and create a new enemy, Venom. He pleads with Harry for help when Venom and Sandman kidnap Mary Jane, but a broken-spirited Harry, whose face is disfigured from the bomb, declines, telling Peter to leave. As Spider-Man takes on the two villains alone, Harry's butler tells him that he knew all along that Norman's death was a result of his own weaponry and not due to Spider-Man; Harry relents and comes to his old friend's aid just as Sandman is about to kill Spider-Man. Harry and Peter prove to be a formidable team and defeat Sandman in addition to saving Mary Jane. Venom proves to be more of a challenge, and as he prepares to stab Peter with Harry's glider, Harry takes the blade for Peter and is tossed aside. Peter finally manages to defeat Venom, and after coming to a truce and understanding with Sandman, finds a mortally-wounded Harry down below with Mary Jane. The two friends forgive each other and reconcile before Harry dies with Peter and Mary Jane at his side. In other media=Television *The character also appears in Spider-Man: The New Animated Series, a CGI-animated television series which serves as a loose continuation of the first Spider-Man film and takes place two years before Spider-Man 2. Harry attends Empire State University with Peter and Mary Jane, retaining his desire for revenge on Spider-Man as he believes he caused his father's death. He is voiced by Ian Ziering in the series. Video games *Harry appears in all three video game adaptations of the films. He is voiced by Josh Keaton in the first and second games, and by James Franco in the third game, which sees a good number of the film's cast also reprise their roles vocally. *This version of Harry Osborn appears in his New Goblin persona in Spider-Man: Friend or Foe, once again voiced by Josh Keaton. In an alternate timeline where the films' villains survived after seemingly dying, New Goblin can be seen briefly saving Spider-Man from his former enemies, but is kidnapped (along with everyone except Spider-Man) by a swarm of unknown creatures who disappear to separate locations. After this, the character is not seen again, but eventually becomes playable either by beating story mode or using a special cheat code inside the Helicarrier. Reception and legacy James Franco at the Spider-Man 3 premiere, April 2007 In the first two films, Harry's presence was noted as brooding by Anthony Lane of The New Yorker. His conversion from one of the film series' main protagonists into a villain in the third movie was met with mixed reviews. Though some considered it a good conclusion to his arc and that Franco finally looked comfortable in his film role, others noted that Harry's stint as the New Goblin was one of the causes of the film being \\"overstuffed\\", especially with the presence of two other villains. In particular, Roger Ebert wrote that his motivations for becoming the new Green Goblin were too simple as compared to his father's. Nonetheless, James Franco received greater mainstream exposure for his portrayal of Harry Osborn in the film series, especially in Spider-Man 3, for which he received four award nominations. In popular culture In the film This Is the End, which also stars James Franco portraying a fictionalized version of himself, the main characters find a cardboard cutout of Harry Osborn/New Goblin as he appears in Spider-Man 3 in Franco's basement. Also, Harry's scene in Spider-Man 3 relishing a slice of pie after Peter leaves the caf√© has gained meme popularity over the years.

Charest was born in Sherbrooke, Quebec, in 1951. She graduated from the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris, having written her thesis on gender relations in crime fiction. She subsequently obtained a higher degree in history, focusing on the treatment of lesbians and gay men in crime novels. Charest subsequently worked various odd jobs: folk singer, apple picker, house painter, cook in a fast-food restaurant, taxi driver, horseback riding teacher for children, and French teacher for adults. These experiences helped inspire some of her later works. She co-directed a documentary film about violence against young girls, published several novels, and wrote in 1993 Ma maison, mon taxi, a biography of Fernande Chartrand, a taxi driver. In 1982, she co- founded as part of a lesbian collective in Montreal the quarterly radical lesbian magazine Amazones d'Hier, Lesbiennes d'Aujourd'hui. She led debates on various subjects, published articles online, and contributed to Lesbia Magazine. Her book Haro sur les fumeurs, jusqu'o√π ira la prohibition? (\\"Haro on Smokers: How Far Will Prohibition Go?\\"), published in 2008, studies the progression of anti-smoking laws in France in the international context.

He spent the majority of his career in Naples' Stazione Zoologica and the University of Naples Federico II, while also spending periods at the American National Institutes of Health and in France. Life and career Salvatore studied medicine at the University of Naples Federico II and, after graduating, travelled to Paris to work at the Coll√®ge de France with the endocrinologist Jean Roche. During his time in Paris from 1956 to 1958, he developed an interest in endocrinology and particularly the thyroid gland. He returned to Naples in 1959 and continued to collaborate with Roche on research into thyroid diseases at the Stazione Zoologica. In 1961, he moved to Marseille before relocating again in 1962 to the United States, where he worked in Jacob Robbins and Joseph Edward Rall's laboratory at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, until 1964. Salvatore returned to Naples in 1964, where he hosted many foreign investigators, and continued to visit laboratories across Europe and the United States. He intermittently spent time at the NIH in Bethesda, where he was a professor of general pathology between 1972 and 1974, and received a NIH Fogarty Scholarship in 1977. He headed the Centre of Experimental Endocrinology and Oncology of the Italian National Research Council (CNR) from 1972 to 1997 and served as dean of the University of Naples Federico II medical school from 1981 to 1997. He was also president of Stazione Zoologica from 1987 and chair of the CNR Committee for Biotechnology from 1994, both until his death in 1997. He successfully advocated for the introduction of iodised salt to prevent endemic goitre and universal newborn screening for congenital hypothyroidism in Italy. Research Salvatore's early research at the NIH focused on the synthesis and structure of thyroglobulin. He discovered in the 1960s that thyroid hormones can be found in the lowest classes of vertebrates and invertebrates. At the NIH, he and his collaborators developed a method for purifying and isolating thyroid iodoproteins (proteins containing iodine) and subsequently discovered a new iodoprotein named 27S thyroglobulin. In the 1980s, he developed the FRTL-5 cell line of rat thyroid cells that was adopted worldwide for performing various functions of the thyroid gland in in vitro experiments. He also contributed to the discovery of the RET proto-oncogene's role in thyroid cancer and the role of various other genes in thyroid development. His last research paper, published posthumously, covered the synthesis of thyroid hormones within the thyroglobulin molecule.

Most covered the whole country, but some focused on local areas of particular concern. Leicester was the first area to be subject to local restrictions, on 4 July 2020, and many other regions were added over the subsequent three months. On 14 October 2020, all of the Statutory Instruments discussed below were revoked and replaced with new regulations implementing a national system of three tiers of restrictions across England.  Legal basis  The local regulations were all introduced by way of a Statutory Instrument made by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, using emergency powers available to him under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, the stated legal basis being \\"the serious and imminent threat to public health which is posed by the incidence and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in England\\". In each case, the Secretary of State used section 45R of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 to enact the regulations without prior parliamentary consideration, subject to retrospective approval by resolution of each House of Parliament within twenty-eight days.See the preamble to each statutory instrument mentioned on this page Leicester=Initial regulations, in force 4 July 2020  Information poster during the Leicester local lockdown The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Leicester) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/685) were the first local lockdown regulations in England, coming into force on 4 July 2020 on the day that the nationwide regulations were relaxed by The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (No. 2) (England) Regulations 2020 which allowed most retail businesses to re-open and allowed certain gatherings of up to 30 people. Those relaxations were disapplied to the City of Leicester and the surrounding area (\\"the protected area\\"), defined by a list of postcode districts. In contrast to the rest of the country, all non-essential businesses had to remain closed, apart from a few exceptions such as garden centres, vehicle showrooms and their outdoor areas. All leisure and recreational facilities (other than outdoor sports courts or amenities) also had to remain closed, with exceptions only for elite athletes. Food and drink establishments were not permitted to make sales for consumption on the premises. Places of worship could open for individual private prayer only. Households of any size could form a \\"linked household\\" with no more than one other household containing exactly one adult and any number of children. The regulations prohibited anyone staying overnight without reasonable excuse within the protected area in a place other than the place where they live, or where their linked household lives. Individuals living outside the protected area were prohibited without from staying overnight without reasonable excuse at any place within the protected area other than the place where their linked household is living. Certain indoor and outdoor gatherings were also banned. Restrict protected area, 18 July 2020  SI 2020/685 was amended on 18 July 2020, after 14 days, by The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Leicester) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/754). These removed Blaby and Charnwood from the protected area, restricting it to the City of Leicester and the Borough of Oadby and Wigston. Open non-essential retail, 24 July 2020  SI 2020/685 was amended on 24 July 2020, after a further six days, by The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Leicester) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/787). These permitted the re-opening of non- essential retail premises, indoor markets in community centres, betting shops, retail galleries, drive-in cinemas, auction houses, and outdoor areas of zoos, safari parks and aquariums. Remove Oadby and Wigston, 1 August 2020  SI 2020/685 was amended on 1 August 2020, after a further eight days, by The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Leicester) (Amendment) (No. 3) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/823) which removed the Borough of Oadby and Wigston from the protected area, limiting it solely to the City of Leicester. Change rules on gatherings, 3 August 2020 Two days later, on 3 August 2020, all of the Leicester regulations were repealed and were replaced by The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Leicester) (No. 2) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/824). These changed the rules on gatherings, restricting gatherings of more than two people within private dwellings (apart from linked households), but allowing up to 30 elsewhere. Some additional premises were permitted to re-open.  Ney \\"stocktake\\" report  The Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government commissioned a rapid review of the work of the Leicester and Leicestershire councils during the local outbreak, in order to share good practices and identify scope for improvement, both locally and nationally. The review began on 5 August and a report by Dame Mary Ney was submitted on 21 August. Nine \\"learning points\\" and six areas of good practice were highlighted.

Add back Oadby and Wigston, 22 September 2020  On 22 September 2020 the Borough of Oadby and Wigston, which had been removed from the protected area on 1 August, was added back. Linked childcare households, 22 September 2020  The concept of 'linked childcare households' was introduced in Leicester and all the local lockdown areas on 22 September 2020. A household with at least one child aged 13 or under can link with another household who will be providing informal childcare. In order to link, all adults in both households have to agree. Each household is allowed a single linked childcare household only, which cannot be changed; multiple links are not permitted. As a new exception to the restrictions on gatherings, a household is allowed to meet with its linked childcare household provided that the meeting is reasonably necessary for the provision of informal childcare. This is an additional exception specifically for informal childcare arrangements, not for Registered Childminders who have their own 'education' exception.

Two households could be permanently 'linked' for this purpose where one household consisted of exactly one adult (no more) plus any number of children; the second could consist of any number of adults and children. Most other types of gathering (indoor and outdoor) of more than six people were also prohibited unless all the individuals were of a common or two linked households, or the gathering was reasonably necessary for certain permitted purposes such as work, education or child care. Also permitted were certain gatherings arranged by a company, charity or political body where a formal risk assessment had been carried out.

These disapplied the standard Rule of six regulations that applied elsewhere in England and replaced them with more onerous restrictions within the areas of Birmingham, Sandwell and Solihull. Within the defined areas, all gatherings (of two or more people) in a private dwelling or garden were prohibited unless the individuals were members of a common household or of a single linked household, or the gathering was reasonably necessary for certain permitted purposes such as work, education or child care.

Where such businesses served food and drink for consumption on the premises during permitted opening hours they could serve only customers sitting at tables. Restrictions on gatherings All gatherings (of two or more people) in a private dwelling or garden were prohibited unless the individuals were members of a common household or of a single linked household, or the gathering was reasonably necessary for certain permitted purposes such as work, education or child care.

Consolidation with North of England and further restrictions, 30 September 2020 On 30 September a number of areas in the North West that were subject to restrictions under these regulations were transferred to be listed under the North of England regulations by The Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (North of England, North East and North West of England and Obligations of Undertakings (England) etc.) (Amendment) Regulations 2020 (SI 2020/1057). For those areas remaining as protected areas under these regulations further restrictions were imposed on gatherings in private dwellings and indoor sittings to prevent two or more persons from meeting in a private dwelling other than for certain specific reasons. Amendments were made to the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (Obligations of Undertakings) (England) Regulations 2020 (Si 2020/1008) to ensure that the obligations placed on hospitality venues were aligned with the further restrictions on gatherings where such venues where located in protected areas subject to the North East and North West of England regulations.

It aired in the United States on Fox on September 27, 2020. The episode was directed by Bob Anderson, and written by David Cryan. David Harbour guest-stars as Mr. Burns' undercover persona Fred and Phil Rosenthal appears as himself. This is also the first episode that Alex D√©sert voices Carl Carlson, taking over the role from Hank Azaria. The episode's title is a reference to the television franchise Undercover Boss. The episode featured Mr. Burns going undercover at his company, the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, similar to the format of Undercover Boss. It received generally positive reviews and was watched live in the United States by 4.44 million viewers. Plot Lisa and Bart go to the power plant with Homer for \\"Take Your Child to Work Day\\", but Mr. Burns decides to change it into \\"Put Your Child to Work Day\\". All of the children are forced to work, but Lisa escapes and confronts Mr. Burns about the use of child labor laws. Mr. Burns decides to hide in the employee restroom, to escape Lisa's distressing plead to be free. While in the restroom, Mr. Burns sees drawings on the walls, and soon finds out that his employees don't like him so much, because of his pompous ways. Smithers decides to help a distraught Mr. Burns go undercover as a man named Fred Kranepool. During his undercover holdup, Mr. Burns plans to \\"infiltrate and kill\\" the employees who mostly dislike him except Homer, Lenny, and Carl, who are all nice to him and become friends with Fred (not actually knowing that it was Mr. Burns). However, during this huge relationship with Kranepool, Smithers becomes jealous of all the time Mr. Burns is spending more time with Homer, Lenny, and Carl, and didn't invite him. Smithers eventually tells Homer that Fred is actually a disguised Mr. Burns. Then, when Lenny makes fun of Mr. Burns being Fred, Mr. Burns decides to go back to being himself. Production=Development The episode was written by David Cryan, who reached out to showrunner Al Jean on Twitter, asking Jean to read some scripts he had written. Cryan was hoping to be given the opportunity to submit a script for The Simpsons, but Jean was impressed enough by Cryan's scripts, particularly those for Veep and Curb Your Enthusiasm, that he invited Cryan to join the show's writing staff. However, Cryan was unable to accept the offer, because Cryan, who lives in Canada, had his United States visa application denied. So, Jean instead offered him a freelance opportunity to write an episode. Cryan chose to write an episode surrounding his favorite character of Mr. Burns, it is Cryan's first television episode. Jean released a still from the episode on September 9, 2020, on Twitter. Also on September 9, 2020, Fox released eight promotional pictures from the episode. Casting David Harbour guest- starred in the episode as Mr. Burns' undercover persona Fred and Phil Rosenthal appeared as himself. Rosenthal previously portrayed TV Dad in The Simpsons Movie. This is also the first episode with Alex D√©sert voicing Carl Carlson, taking over from Hank Azaria who voiced the character since the first season. This came after the producers of the series announced that \\"Moving forward, The Simpsons will no longer have white actors voice non-white characters.\\" Reception=Viewing figures In the United States, the episode was watched live by 4.44 million viewers. Critical response Tony Sokol with Den of Geek, said \\"'Undercover Burns' makes for a fun and informative season premiere episode. Mr. Burns always delivers, except on any promises he‚Äôs made.\\" Kevin Melrose with CBR, said \\"those longtime critics who insist The Simpsons peaked in 1993 will no doubt point to the Season 32 premiere as only the latest supporting evidence. From the green screen couch gag to its parody of Undercover Boss, a reality series that's been on the air for more than a decade, 'Undercover Burns' is hardly cutting edge. And yet, the episode still surprises.\\" References Category:2020 American television episodes Category:The Simpsons (season 32) episodes ","title":"Undercover Burns"},{"id":"64970613","text":"Senator Mathis may also refer to: *Liz Mathis (born 1958), Iowa State Senate *Thomas A.

It is the most substantial remaining part of what used to be Canonbury House, erected for the Canons of St Bartholomew's Priory between 1509 and 1532. The tower has been occupied by many historical figures, including Sir Francis Bacon and Oliver Goldsmith. It is a Grade II* listed building, and is located in Canonbury Place, east of Canonbury Square. History Before the Norman Conquest the land now contained in the triangle formed by Upper Street, Essex Road and St Paul's Road was an Anglo-Saxon manor. Passing to Norman ownership, it Ô¨Ånally became part of the vast estates of the de Berners family. In 1253 Ralph de Berners made a grant of \\"lands, rents and their appurtenances in Iseldone\\" to the Prior and Canons of St Bartholomew'san Augustinian orderin SmithÔ¨Åeld. The area thus became known as the Canons' Burgh. In 1509 William Bolton was elected as the new Prior. Bolton substantially restored and added to St Bartholomew's and was Henry VIII's Master of the Works for the building of the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey. He also built a mansion in Canonbury for himself, his Canons and his successors. It is uncertain how much of the Canonbury House that took shape in the 16th century was Prior Bolton's work, but the tower is certainly his work; some sources give the date for the tower as c. 1562, but this is incorrect as Prior Bolton died in 1532. When the monasteries were dissolved by Henry VIII, St Bartholomew's and its appendages were among the last to be taken. Prior Robert Fuller surrendered the Priory and its lands to the Crown on 25th October 1539. Henry VIII bestowed the manor of Canonbury on his Chief Minister for the Dissolution, Thomas Cromwell, only a year before his execution on 28th July 1540. In 1547 the manor was granted by Edward VI to John Dudley, Earl of Warwick, later Duke of Northumberland. He was executed in 1553 for his abortive attempt to place his daughter-in-law, Lady Jane Grey, on the throne. Queen Mary I in 1556 granted the manor to one David Broke, and in 1557 to the second Lord Wentworth. John Spencer Ô¨Årst leased the house from Wentworth for ¬£21.11s.4d, and then bought it for ¬£2,000. Spencer was popularly known as \\"Rich Spencer\\" and he amassed one of the greatest private fortunes of his day. He rose to become Sir John Spencer, Knight, Lord Mayor of London in 1594. Spencer took up regular occupation of Canonbury House in 1599, and modernised the tower to make it inhabitable and added the main embellishments such as plaster ceilings, panelling and ornamental mantelpieces, which all date from that period. Thereafter it often becomes hard to determine whether individuals were resident in the house or in the tower. In 1605 the Lord Chancellor, Thomas Egerton, later Earl of Ellesmere, issued some Charters from Canonbury House and was presumably in residence. Spencer had no son but a daughter Elizabeth. She had fallen in love with William Compton, 2nd Baron Compton, who succeeded his father in 1589 when only 21 and went to the royal court of Queen Elizabeth I, borrowing from John Spencer when he had spent what his father had left him. Spencer did not regard marriage to his daughter as a suitable way of liquidating the debt, so he opposed it and conÔ¨Åned his daughter in Canonbury Tower. She and Lord Compton eloped: supposedly, the young lord disguised as a baker's boy drove his cart over the Ô¨Åelds to Islington and Elizabeth was lowered from a window in a baker's basket and escaped to marriage in 1599. Sir John disowned his daughter, costing the couple a fortune variously estimated at from three hundred to eight hundred thousand pounds. However, a son was born to the Comptons in 1601, and Spencer was partially reconciled through the efforts of the Queen, saying that having now no daughter he would adopt the child as his son. The reconciliation was completed with the birth of a second child, a daughter, in Canonbury House and the fortune found its way to them on Spencer's death in 1610. Compton then became \\"in great danger to loose his witts\\" and spent \\"within lesses than eight weekes...¬£72,000, most in great horses, rich saddles and playe\\", and on gambling, entertaining and extending the country seat at Castle Ashby, Northamptonshire, and not on Canonbury House which was let. The young lord eventually became Lord President of the Council in 1617, and in 1618 was created 1st Earl of Northampton. Canonbury Tower, viewed from the west From 1616 to 1625 the house was leased to Sir Francis Bacon, philosopher and statesman, who was at Ô¨Årst Attorney General and the year after Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. There is a tradition that Bacon planted the mulberry tree that still Ô¨Çourishes in the courtyard next to the tower to encourage the home production of silk. In the English Civil War, Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton and his six sons supported the King's cause. The Earl was killed at the Battle of Hopton Heath. The family was Ô¨Åned ¬£40,000 during the Commonwealth, sold property and mortgaged Canonbury House, where they took up residence. The mortgage dated 1661 included \\"all that capital messuage and Mansion House commonly called Canonbury alias Canbury House, and all that tenement called the Turret House situated and being at the end of the courtyard and the Park, to secure ¬£1751\\". A son was born to James Compton, 3rd Earl of Northampton at Canonbury House in 1653 and another died aged Ô¨Åve in 1662. No other Earl or Marquess of Northampton has since resided at Canonbury House. During the 18th century the buildings were let, part of them in separate rooms. At Christmas 1762 the novelist, playwright and poet Oliver Goldsmith took a room in the house which he occupied for about eighteen months, allegedly often using it to hide from his creditors. It is uncertain whether any of his novel The Vicar of Wakefield was written in Canonbury Tower, where tradition has it that Goldsmith occupied the Spencer Room. On Sunday, 26 June 1763 James Boswell notes in his London Journal: \\"I then walked out to Islington to Canonbury House, a curious old monastic building now let out in lodgings where Dr. Goldsmith stays. I took tea with him and found him very chatty.\\" An earlier literary lodger was Samuel Humphreys whose libretti for three of Handel's early oratoriosEsther, Athalia and Deborahdate from 1730 to 1738, when he died. Handel \\"esteemed the harmony of his numbers\\". The publisher John Newbery was in residence between 1761 to 1767. Newbery wrote numerous books for the young with such titles as \\"Logic made familiar and easy\\". His best known creation was Goody Two-Shoes. Ephraim Chambers, the Ô¨Årst cyclopaedist, died there in 1740. He was unrelated to his namesakes who founded Chambers's Encyclopaedia. Another lodger was the printer and journalist Henry Sampson Woodfall, who edited the Public Advertiser in which from 1769 for three years the Letters of Junius appeared, to the great discomÔ¨Åture of the government. Woodfall was tried for printing the letters and accused of seditious libel, but went free after the judge decided in favour of a mistrial. His grandfather Henry Woodfall invented the characters Darby and Joan. In 1767 Mr John Dawes, a City stockbroker, acquired a lease of the whole house and adjoining grounds. He added bay windows to the tower and in a significant change he demolished the entire south range of the old Canonbury House and on its site built the houses now numbered 1‚Äì5 Canonbury Place overlooking the garden. At some unspecified date, probably in the 1790s, a handsome small mansion for which no records survive was built adjoining the tower, partly filling the west side of the old manor house court. This building has also confusingly come to be known as Canonbury House. In the early nineteenth century Washington Irving, creator of Rip Van Winkle, hoped to be inspired by Goldsmith's muse and engaged his roomreputedly the Spencer Roomat the tower, which he referred to as \\"Canonbury Castle\\". He remained only a few days. When Sunday came he was \\"stunned with shouts and noises from the cricket ground\\" nearby and his \\"intolerable landlady\\" was perpetually bringing parties of visitors not only up to the tower but into the room where he was working. He remonstrated, locked the door and pocketed the key, only to hear the landlady allowing the visitors to peep through the keyhole at the \\"author who was always in a tantrum when interrupted\\". View of the tower and adjoining buildings and fish pond, around 1846 Charles Lamb, essayist, poet, and antiquarian, loved to visit the tower when he lived in Islington. He was \\"never weary of toiling up the steep winding stairs and peeping into its sly comers and cupboards\\". He also enjoyed the view from the top. A book written in 1835 still speaks of its being possible to see from there \\"the adjacent villages and surrounding countryside\\". From 1826 to 1907 the tower was the home of the bailiff of the estate. In 1885 it is described as being in a sadly dilapidated state. \\"Although the exterior looks substantial enough, and the splendid carved wood panelling is intact, all the rooms are deserted and many are decaying\\". In 1907 an American advocate of the Baconian theory of Shakespeare authorship travelled to England. She believed she had decoded a message which revealed that Francis Bacon's secret manuscripts were hidden behind panels in the tower. None were found. Canonbury Tower, photographed c. 1879, prior to the 1907‚Äì08 restoration. Before removal, one main trunk of ivy was thick and the growth had made holes square in the brickwork. In 1907‚Äì08 the 5th Marquess of Northampton completely restored the tower, preserving the original features where rebuilding was necessary. The ivy was removed: before removal, one main trunk of ivy was thick and the growth had made holes square in the brickwork. The iron railings round the top of the tower were replaced by a brick parapet; and some of the old oak roof beams were used for restoration. A new building was erected adjacent to the tower, King Edward's Hall; it served as a recreation hall and with the tower itself formed the premises of a social club for the residents of the Marquess's Canonbury and Clerkenwell estates. In 1924 the Francis Bacon Society was granted a tenancy of part of the gabled building east of the tower, and made its headquarters there with its remarkable library. Early in 1940, when many of the estate tenants had been evacuated and a large proportion of the houses were standing empty, the social club surrendered its tenancy. Shortly afterwards, for fear of damage by enemy action, the sixteenth-century oak panelling and chimney pieces in the Compton and Spencer Rooms were taken down section by section for storage at Castle Ashby until the war ended. Happily, the damage caused by bombing to the historic buildings in Canonbury was negligible. From 1941 onward, Canonbury Tower and King Edward's Hall were used as a youth centre for the beneÔ¨Åt of some 300 boys and girls, most of whom were living on the estate. After the war, the youth centre was rehoused elsewhere on the estate. The panelling and chimney pieces were brought back, cleaned and restored under the supervision of the Keeper of Woodwork at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and reinstated. The Marquess provided suitable furniture for the Compton and Spencer Rooms and the great brass chandeliers which now light those rooms. In 1952, the Tavistock Repertory Company took a lease of the tower and King Edward's Hall. As the Tower Theatre Company it mounted nearly 1600 productions in the hall, ending when the lease expired in 2003. Since 1998 the tower has been used as a Masonic research centre. It can occasionally be visited as part of a guided tour. Description The tower is high and about square. The brick walls vary in thickness from to . The main entrance hall leads into a low hall adjoining the tower itself, and on the ground Ô¨Çoor is a room with the original brickwork exposed. Spencer Room Fireplace and panelling in the Spencer Room The room on the Ô¨Årst Ô¨Çoor commemorating the occupancy and work of Sir John Spencer is the plainer of the two panelled rooms. The chimneypiece is the most elaborate part, with lions' heads. At the top just below the ceiling there are three curious carved Ô¨Ågures like the Ô¨Ågurehead of a ship and there is another, which has lost its head, at eye level in the centre, just below a pair of bellows. There is strapwork ornament on the underside of the mantelpiece, and at either side Tudor roses in what might be garters preÔ¨Ågure or reÔ¨Çect the Rosicrucian interests of Sir Francis Bacon. The same pattern is found on the upright pillars of the Great Bed of Ware. Twelve Ô¨Çat pilasters run from Ô¨Çoor to ceiling. By the end of the 16th century the Italian workmen who had come over to help Henry VIII on his various projectsthe tomb of Henry VII and Greenwich and Whitehall Palaceshad mostly gone back and the workmanship is probably mainly Flemish. Compton Room Faith and Hope panelling in the Compton Room On the second floor the panelling is more elaborate, of the type called \\"panel within panel\\", and there is liberal use of strapwork on the ten pilasters. The chimneypiece again is elaborate, with Ô¨Ågures of Faith (one knee exposed, one arm missing) and Hope in a border of Ô¨Çowers and abstract pattern. The Latin inscribed beneath FaithFides Via Deus Metameans \\"Faith is my way, God is my aim\\", and under HopeSpes Certa Suprameans \\"My sure hope is above\\". The frieze over the Ô¨Åreplace consists of pomegranates and exotic fruits. Elsewhere it is a shell pattern, with at various intervals the arms of Spencer (argent two bars gemelle between three eagles displayed sable) and semi-grotesque heads. On the east side the panelling has been moved forward to provide another room, which contains bricked up a mullion window of the original typereplaced by windows of seasoned Oregon pine elsewhere in these rooms. The room is now all that remains of the occupancy of the Francis Bacon Society. Over the main door there is a carving known as a \\"cresting\\" incorporating a spread eagle. Staircase The tower, whose core is the central staircase, has a stairway in short straight Ô¨Çights and quarter landings, with the centre Ô¨Ålled in with timber and plaster forming a series of cupboards. The black oak of the balusters is mostly original timber. At the top, the handrail newel and baluster are cut from sound oak beams found among the woodwork during the restoration of 1907‚Äì08: four centuries old but when sawn still fresh and sweet smelling. Inscription Room List of Kings and Queens of England in the Inscription Room The space below the roof forms a small room, once presumably a schoolroom, containing a list of the Kings and Queens of England, from Will Conq to Carolus qui longo tempore in rough Latin and Norman French hexameters. There is also a mnemonic in Latin elegiac which can be translated as \\"Let your thoughts be on your own death, the deceits of the world, the glory of heaven and the pains of hell\\". On the roof itself, which was not originally Ô¨Çat, is a weather vane said to be copper. The iron railings originally there are now at ground level at the front of the building.

Foreign debt accumulation throughout Latin America, a series of natural disasters, mass public expenditures, nationalizations of banks and financial institutions, and the shutting of Peru out of international credit markets led to a decade of macroeconomic decline. The financial crisis soon became adopted into the public sphere through hyperinflation in commodities, food shortages, and mass unemployment. By the end of the decade, Peru's gross domestic product (GDP) contracted over 20%, and poverty rose to 55%. The 1980s is often deemed as \\"The Lost Decade\\" in Peru, as the result of its social and economic crises. As a result of the crisis, large waves of Peruvians immigrated to neighboring countries such as the United States and Argentina. The financial crisis was ultimately subdued during the first year of the presidency of Alberto Fujimori, after a series of economic reforms that attempted resolve the foreign debt crisis and hyperinflation.  Causes = Declining commodity prices and foreign debt accumulation  In the first half of the 1980s, the values copper and silver, Peru's two largest exports, had declined in price to a 40-year low. From 1980 to 1982, the price of copper collapsed from nearly $3000 per tonne to $1300 per tonne. By 1987, the price of copper had only increased to $1380 per tonne. Additionally, El Ni√±o devastated Peru's fishing economy and led to destructive flooding and droughts in the region of Lima. As Peru's exports value began to decline, President Fernando Belaund√© began to limit Peru's payments on its international debts in the first years of his administration. Bela√∫nde continued to increase Peru's investment into massive infrastructure projects, including interstate highways, railroads, and airports, increased spending in flood and drought aid, thus substantially increasing Peru's federal spending. Bela√∫nde was faced by a series of strict austerity measures recommended by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after the buildup of foreign debt in Peru and throughout South America. Such measures aimed to lower the Peruvian government's deficit through less public spending and increasing government revenue. Bela√∫nde gave the impression that his administration was following the austerity measures recommended by the IMF, while in reality Bela√∫nde would downplay the debt crisis as terrorism began to grow in Peru's highlands by the Shining Path. As a result, as economic stagflation began to occur and inflation grew to 60%.  Loss of international creditors  By 1983, Peru accumulated $13.5 billion (77.8% of GDP) in foreign debt and its gross domestic product had collapsed by 20%. Bela√∫nde argued that the military regimes preceding his presidency, particularly the military regimes of Juan Velasco Alvarado and Francisco Morales Bermudez, had been convinced by foreign banks to borrow billions of dollars. Facing growing pressure, Bela√∫nde visited Washington, D.C. in 1984 in a last effort to beg President Ronald Reagan for help in his bankrupt administration. A White House aide commented that 'President Reagan only gave him half an hour, and suggested Bela√∫nde follow austerity programs outlined by banks and the IMF. Populism began to grow and the International Monetary Fund became a scapegoat for Peru's debt crisis. A surge in populism due to the crisis favored presidential candidate Alan Garc√≠a's economic proposals that would cut Peru's lines with international investors and banks. Following his election, Garc√≠a ordered the closing of the International Monetary Fund's office in Lima and ordered the nationalization of banks and other financial institutions in Peru. Viewed as a virtual default, investors soon pulled completely out of Peru and the Lima Stock Exchange suffered a significant drop.  Effects = Hyperinflation  Currency change = Peru's had switched its currency twice from 1985 to 1990. In 1985, President Alan Garcia introduced the Peruvian inti, a short-lived currency that valued 1000 Peruvian soles. Banknotes were initially printed in values of 10, 50, and 100 intis, however banknotes subsequently were printed in larger quantities due to continued hyperinflation. Peruvian intis were printed in values of 50,000, 100,000 and up to banknotes of 5,000,000 intis by the end of its circulation. Despite Garcia's attempts to encourage Peruvians to circulate and trust the Peruvian inti, the public turned towards exchanging and relying on United States dollars, leading to foreign exchange controls and the usage of the dollar MUC, a separate currency instituted by the Peruvian government worth identically to the United States dollar, until keeping up with inflation bankrupted the Central Bank of Peru. President Alan Garcia, whose fiscal policies are largely accredited to exacerbating the financial crisis In 1990, Peru's currency was switched again from the Peruvian inti to the Peruvian nuevo sol as inflation began to decrease. A government initiative offered to exchange nuevo soles with Peruvians intis at the exchange rate of 1,000,000 Peruvian intis. Inflation continued to decline which contributed favorably to the new currency's circulation and reliability with the general public. Peruvian intis and the original Peruvian sol were ousted out of circulation in 1991. As of 2020, the Peruvian nuevo sol remains Peru's national currency. = Price inflation = In 1988, the Peruvian government reported consumer prices rising 1,722%, or on average 143.5% per month. The Garcia administration's policy of a self-sustainable economy caused imported goods to significantly increase in price. Pharmaceutical products increased nearly 600% and the price of petroleum quadrupled. In September 1988, economists declared that the inflation became hyperinflation. The middle and lower classes soon began to feel the subsequent effects of the protectionist policies. Peru experienced a shortage of raw materials and food, and long strikes in the mining industry led to falling exports, leading the trade deficit even further and increased unemployment. = Consumer prices inflation by year = { \\"version\\": 2, \\"width\\": 400, \\"height\\": 200, \\"data\\": [ { \\"name\\": \\"table\\", \\"values\\": [ { \\"x\\": 1970, \\"y\\": 5 }, { \\"x\\": 1971, \\"y\\": 6 }, { \\"x\\": 1972, \\"y\\": 7 }, { \\"x\\": 1973, \\"y\\": 9 }, { \\"x\\": 1974, \\"y\\": 17 }, { \\"x\\": 1975, \\"y\\": 24 }, { \\"x\\": 1976, \\"y\\": 33 }, { \\"x\\": 1977, \\"y\\": 38 }, { \\"x\\": 1978, \\"y\\": 58 }, { \\"x\\": 1979, \\"y\\": 67 }, { \\"x\\": 1980, \\"y\\": 59 }, { \\"x\\": 1981, \\"y\\": 75 }, { \\"x\\": 1982, \\"y\\": 64 }, { \\"x\\": 1983, \\"y\\": 111 }, { \\"x\\": 1984, \\"y\\": 110 }, { \\"x\\": 1985, \\"y\\": 163 }, { \\"x\\": 1986, \\"y\\": 78 }, { \\"x\\": 1987, \\"y\\": 86 }, { \\"x\\": 1988, \\"y\\": 667 }, { \\"x\\": 1989, \\"y\\": 3399 }, { \\"x\\": 1990, \\"y\\": 7481 }, { \\"x\\": 1991, \\"y\\": 409 }, { \\"x\\": 1992, \\"y\\": 74 }, { \\"x\\": 1993, \\"y\\": 48 }, { \\"x\\": 1994, \\"y\\": 23 }, { \\"x\\": 1995, \\"y\\": 11 }, { \\"x\\": 1996, \\"y\\": 11 }, { \\"x\\": 1997, \\"y\\": 8 }, { \\"x\\": 1998, \\"y\\": 7 }, { \\"x\\": 1999, \\"y\\": 3 }, { \\"x\\": 2000, \\"y\\": 3 }, { \\"x\\": 2001, \\"y\\": 2 }, { \\"x\\": 2002, \\"y\\": 0 }, { \\"x\\": 2003, \\"y\\": 2 }, { \\"x\\": 2004, \\"y\\": 4 }, { \\"x\\": 2005, \\"y\\": 2 }, { \\"x\\": 2006, \\"y\\": 2 }, { \\"x\\": 2007, \\"y\\": 2 }, { \\"x\\": 2008, \\"y\\": 6 }, { \\"x\\": 2009, \\"y\\": 3 }, { \\"x\\": 2010, \\"y\\": 2 }, { \\"x\\": 2011, \\"y\\": 3 }, { \\"x\\": 2012, \\"y\\": 4 }, { \\"x\\": 2013, \\"y\\": 3 }, { \\"x\\": 2014, \\"y\\": 3 }, { \\"x\\": 2015, \\"y\\": 4 }, { \\"x\\": 2016, \\"y\\": 4 }, { \\"x\\": 2017, \\"y\\": 3 }, { \\"x\\": 2018, \\"y\\": 1 }, { \\"x\\": 2019, \\"y\\": 2 } ] } ], \\"scales\\": [ { \\"name\\": \\"x\\", \\"type\\": \\"linear\\", \\"range\\": \\"width\\", \\"zero\\": false, \\"domain\\": { \\"data\\": \\"table\\", \\"field\\": \\"x\\" } }, { \\"name\\": \\"y\\", \\"type\\": \\"linear\\", \\"range\\": \\"height\\", \\"nice\\": true, \\"domain\\": { \\"data\\": \\"table\\", \\"field\\": \\"y\\" } } ], \\"axes\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"x\\", \\"scale\\": \\"x\\" }, { \\"type\\": \\"y\\", \\"scale\\": \\"y\\" } ], \\"marks\\": [ { \\"type\\": \\"line\\", \\"from\\": { \\"data\\": \\"table\\" }, \\"properties\\": { \\"enter\\": { \\"x\\": { \\"scale\\": \\"x\\", \\"field\\": \\"x\\" }, \\"y\\": { \\"scale\\": \\"y\\", \\"field\\": \\"y\\" }, \\"y2\\": { \\"scale\\": \\"y\\", \\"value\\": 0 }, \\"interpolate\\": { \\"value\\": \\"monotone\\" }, \\"stroke\\": { \\"value\\": \\"steelblue\\" }, \\"strokeWidth\\": { \\"value\\": 3 } } } } ] }  Unemployment  Peru's fiscal policy in the late 1980s cut Peru off from the international market. As demand for manufactured goods in exports declined, the manufacturing industry began to lay off workers. Wages declined a reportedly 50% or more during the period. Unemployment had reached a threshold over 6% in the late 1980s, both in the country's formal and informal business sectors.  Macroeconomic  Peru's gross domestic product at the start of the decade (in constant 2010 USD) was $64.7 billion. By 1990, Peru's gross domestic product had devalued to $58.5 billion. It would take until 1996 for the country's GDP to reach levels higher than those in the 1980s. GDP growth averaged -0.72% annually from 1980 to 1990, although growth was mostly erratic in value. GDP growth peaked in 1987 at 9.7% and reached an all-time low in 1989 at -12.3%. GDP per capita peaked in 1981 at $1,203 and reached its low in 1988 at $729, significantly lower than the world average of $3772 in 1988. In 1990, government debt reached 190% of GDP.  Civil unrest and revolutionary movements  Shining Path Propaganda advocating for \\"5 years of proletariat revolution\\" in 1985 Groups throughout the rural areas of Peru viewed the economic crisis as evidence of the failure of a capitalist free-market economy. Socialist and communist groups began to spawn initially through Belaunde's term, and soon began to grow power and the backing of the Peruvian rural population by 1985, exacerbated by unemployment and hyperinflation which directly shook Peru's middle and lower classes. Terror groups, such as the Shining Path and the MRTA grew popular support by promising aid to the lower social classes by shifting the Peruvian economy towards socialism. A number of communist groups, particularly the Shining Path used the economic crisis as an opportunity to advocate for revolution. It was estimated that the Shining Path had some 5,000 full-time fighters and nearly 50,000 sympathizers by 1989.  Legacy = Immigration  The evident long-term effects of the financial crisis in the general public is accredited to starting a large wave of outwards migration from Peru. While in the 1970s immigration out of Peru ranged from 80,000 to 90,000 Peruvians, by 1992, immigration increased to around 354,000 Peruvians leaving the country annually towards primarily the United States, Argentina, and Spain. Record migration out of Peru sparked further waves in the start of the 21st century, where immigration grew to nearly 910,000 and peaked at 1,200,000 in 2007. Currently in the United States, 39% of Americans of Peruvian origins had lived in the United States for over 20 years with a median age of 46, meaning that a vast majority of immigrants had travelled in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Political impact  Peru's economic recovery in the 1990s consequent to the Fujimori administration's neoliberal economic reforms has been a major victory for the Fujimorist faction.

Plot summary Many years ago, all of the superheroes of the Extraordinary Association of Government Law Enforcers (EAGLES) suddenly went missing except for one, who appeared in the middle of London and went berserk. He has been raving mad since then, and held in an asylum. Now the next generation of superheroes (the players) are called upon to step up when they learn that a team of supervillains plans to kidnap the insane EAGLE as he is transferred to another asylum. Publication history Legacy of EAGLES was written by Simon Burley, with a cover by Brian Bolland, and interior art by Kevin Hopgood. It was published in 1984 by Games Workshop as a 24-page book with two color maps, character cards, and cardstock miniatures. Reception In the August 1985 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #68), Marcus L. Rowland gave a generally positive review, saying, \\"I played in this scenario before reading it, and found it very enjoyable. However, the format does seem to emphasise combat rather than detection or role-playing, a common flaw of most superhero scenarios. My other main reservation was the price, which makes Legacy more expensive than some US imports.\\" Rowland concluded by giving it an excellent overall rating of 9 out of 10. In the September 1985 edition of Imagine (Issue #30), Pete Tamlyn liked that \\"almost everything you need is provided, including beautifully produced map-sheets, fold-together cardboard figures and quick reference cards for each major villain.\\" Tamlyn also complimented the design of the adventure for helping new groups of players to get going, and thought that \\"most of the plot is very good, the NPCs are decidely non- cardboard, and the player-characters cannot win on brawn alone.\\" However, Tamlyn didn't like the final encounter, saying that it \\"is handled poorly, leaving [the players] feeling that they had no party in the victory.\\" He concluded though, that is was \\"a very encouraging product.\\" References Category:Superhero role-playing game adventures ","title":"Legacy of EAGLES"},{"id":"64970981","text":"Luca Oyen (born 14 March 2003) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Genk.

Webster was a Chicago area architect who designed private homes and public buildings, including the award-winning Chess Pavilion on Chicago's lakefront.  Personal life  Webster was born September 20, 1892 in Evanston Illinois, the youngest child of Chicago industrialist Towner K. Webster and Emma Josephine Kitchell. His older brother was the well known author, Henry Kitchell Webster. Maurice was trained as an architect at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. In 1916 he was licensed to practice in Illinois. Bee Tree Farm depicted in 1942 drypoint by Morris Henry Hobbs. His first commission was to build a summer home for his father. Bee Tree Farm, in Oregon Illinois, was completed in 1917. It was a wood frame house with a great room and a large screened-in porch overlooking a pool and pastureland beyond. Some years later, his nephew, the noted artist Stokely Webster, described the Bee Tree as a ‚Äúmagical place‚Äù that shaped his style of painting. Maurice Webster went on to have a long career designing a public buildings and private homes in a variety of architectural styles. Among his projects, Webster would build an airport, a castle, a stadium and field house, and Chicago‚Äôs Chess Pavilion. He died on May 17, 1982 in Evanston.  Sky Harbor  Webster went into partnership with architect Alfred P. Allen. In 1929 they designed the Club House at Sky Harbor Airport in Northbrook Illinois, a suburb north of Chicago. The United Aviation Corporation conceived of Sky Harbor as an ‚Äúaviation country club,‚Äù and spent an unheard of $500,000 on its construction. The central feature and public face of the airport was the Club House. The Chicago Tribune described it as the ‚Äúlatest thing in modernistic architecture and also reminiscent of ancient Aztec buildings.‚Äù It had a large square base with each succeeding floor stepping back to form a central tower. The first floor contained a waiting room and public facilities. The second floor housed a restaurant and nightclub. The third floor had a lounge and rooms for overnight guests. Outside, the building was surrounded by terraces where people could watch the airplanes. The Club House opened in June 1929. But the Great Depression brought an end to Sky Harbor just six months later. The building was later destroyed by fire.  Stronghold Castle  Walter Strong at Stronghold. Courtesy Strong Family Collection. At about the same time that Sky Harbor was on the drawing boards, Webster was hired to design a home for Walter A. Strong, the publisher of the Chicago Daily News. Architecturally, this project was worlds apart from Sky Harbor. And it still stands. Strong wanted to build a summer home for his wife and five young children. He had purchased 360 acres of wooded property north of Oregon, Illinois that included a limestone bluff overlooking the Rock River. His wife, Josephine, was Maurice Webster‚Äôs older sister, so Strong had been a frequent guest at Bee Tree Farm. He wanted Webster to design a house that would sit atop the bluff. The original concept was to build a simple barn and silo structure, but it quickly grew into something resembling a castle, with 16 bedrooms, 9 baths, and 8 fireplaces. It took two years to complete and cost $85,000. The castle was done in a Tudor Revival architectural style that was influenced by Strong‚Äôs travels to Europe and his English ancestry. It came to be known as the Stronghold Castle. It had a Great Hall reminiscent of a medieval banqueting room, a circular library with a movable bookcase that revealed a secret passage, and a five-story circular tower with a staircase that seemed to float as it spiraled upwards. Webster accomplished that effect by using unseen steel rods to cantilever each tread out from the wall. At the top was an observation deck with commanding views of the surrounding countryside. The Strong family spent their first summer in residence in 1930. In 1962, the family sold Stronghold to the Presbyterian Church. It now serves as a four-season retreat, conference center and camp. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers goes there for team building exercises, and still marvels at how the staircase was built.  Beloit College stadium and field house  Walter Strong was a graduate and trustee of Beloit College. After his untimely death, in 1931, Josephine donated the funds to build a stadium in his honor. Maurice Webster was commissioned to design Strong Stadium. It was a contemporary poured concrete structure with a series of ramps and passageways. It seated 1,600 and was dedicated October 13, 1934. Its seating capacity was later increased. It is still in use today. After World War II, the G.I. Bill increased the size of the student body at the college. The 1904 gymnasium was no longer adequate. In 1946, Beloit College began planning a field house that could serve as a gymnasium and provide space for large events, such as concerts and commencement ceremonies. The College bought an unused Army aircraft hangar, that was boxed but had never been shipped overseas. This provided the basic structure for the field house, but it needed an architect to bring the plan to fruition. They turned once again to Maurice Webster to design the field house. The project was deceptively complex. It was to include balconies, a running track, locker rooms, exercise rooms and showers. The College paid $11,000 for the surplus hangar, but the ultimate construction cost was $300,000. Dedicated on December 6, 1947, is was described as ‚Äústrikingly modern, through the base of a pylon of concrete and glass.‚Äù  Chess Pavilion  The Chess Pavilion at North Avenue Beach Ever since the 1930s, North Avenue Beach had been a popular summer spot for Chicagoans to gather and play chess. In the 1950s, Laurens Hammond, Chairman of the Board of the Hammond Organ Company, and a chess lover himself, donated $90,000 for the construction of a new Chess Pavilion at North Beach. Maurice Webster, Hammond‚Äôs friend, was commissioned to design the Pavilion. The Pavilion, a modern open-air structure made of Indiana limestone and sweeping concrete forms, is both ‚Äúarchitectural and a sculptural work of art.‚Äù A seating area covered by a thin, wing-like roof overlooks Lake Michigan. Five- foot tall sculptures of king and queen chess pieces flank the area, while other pieces are incised in limestone. These were created by artist Boris Gilbertson (1907-1982). The Chess Pavilion was opened in 1957. That year, it received a citation of merit from the Chicago Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. It has been delighting people ever since. Blair Kamin, architecture critic for the Chicago Tribune, wrote the Pavilion is ‚Äúat once a sculptural object, and orienting device and a lively people place.‚Äù In 2016, it earned a honorable mention for the Leicester B. Holland prize.  References  Category:1892 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Architects from Chicago Category:Cornell University alumni ","title":"Maurice H.

Gameplay The Worlds of Boris Vallejo is a strategy board game. Its components are: * Thirty world tiles, each featuring a different painting by Boris Vallejo * Thirty world reference cards, one for each world tile * A deck of cards, made up of characters, scrolls and artifacts, each with a numerical combat strength * Plastic pawns Set-up One player chooses a world tile and places it on the tabletop. Players then take turns choosing world tiles and placing them so that they touch another tile. This continues until all thirty tiles have been placed. Each player then chooses one of the worlds to be their home tile, places their pawn on the home world tile, and receives the reference card for that tile. Card draw Each turn, the active player draws three cards from the deck, and may play up to two cards ‚Äî a character, and an item that character can use ‚Äî as defense on a world tile that they control. Movement Each turn, the active player can move their pawn one tile. If that tile is uncontrolled, the player now owns it, and receives the reference card for that world. If the world is controlled by another player, combat results. Combat The attacking player plays two cards ‚Äî a character card and either an artifact card or scroll card. The total of the two cards' combat factors is compared to the combat factors of the cards that the defending player previously assigned to the world. Either player can ask other players to aid in the combat by providing one card to be added to either the attacker or defender. Whichever side has the greater sum of combat factors wins the combat. Victory conditions The first player to control eight worlds wins the game. Reception In the August 1985 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #68), Paul Mason admired the production values of the world cards, calling them \\"immaculately printed Boris pictures in glorious colour\\" although he pointed out that Vallejo's art \\"is completely incidental to the mechanics of the game.\\" But the rest of the components were not as good ‚Äî Mason called the cards only \\"competently produced\\", and the plastic pawns \\"the worst kind of plastic rubbish.\\" Mason thought the rules were too similar to Cosmic Encounter, Risk and Talisman, saying, \\"this is a highly derivative game - its systems all originated in other games, and work better in those games than here.\\" Mason also thought the game would go on far longer than its stated 30-minute playing time, since \\"an half-comptetent group of players will not allow anyone to win ‚Äî allying in unison against anyone who gets dangerously close to the crucial eight worlds.\\" He concluded by giving The Worlds of Boris Vallejo an extremely poor overall rating of only 3 out of 10, stating \\"The game strikes me as a cynical attempt to cash in on the popularity of Boris Vallejo's artwork, which displays a very low opinion of its intended market.\\" References Category:Board games introduced in 1984 Category:Mayfair Games games ","title":"The Worlds of Boris Vallejo"},{"id":"64971111","text":"In Jewish tradition, lying is generally forbidden but is required in certain exceptional cases, such as to save a life. Hebrew Bible The Tanakh (Hebrew Bible) forbids perjury in at least three verses: \\"You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor\\" (Exodus 20:12, part of the Ten Commandments), also phrased \\"Neither shall you bear false witness against your neighbor\\" (Deuteronomy 5, see ), and another verse \\"Keep yourself far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous do not kill; for I will not justify the wicked\\" (Exodus 23, see ). According to Deuteronomy 19 (see ), false witnesses should receive the same punishment that they sought to mete out on the unjustly accused. A similar prohibition, \\"You shall not steal; neither shall you deal falsely, nor lie one to another\\" (Leviticus 19, see ) relates to business dealings. There are also passages which condemn lying in general: \\"He that does deceit shall not dwell within My house; he that speaks false-hood shall not be established before My eyes\\" (Psalm 101:7), \\"There are six things which the Lord hates, indeed, seven which are an abomination unto Him: Haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood\\" (Proverbs 6, see ) and \\"Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord; but they who deal truly are His delight\\" (Proverbs 12, see ), \\"The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies, neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth\\" (Zechariah 3, see ), \\"They have taught their tongue to speak lies, they weary themselves to commit iniquity\\" (Jeremiah 9, see ). However, in various biblical stories, those who lie and mislead are not necessarily condemned, and in some cases are praised. Biblical figures that engaged in deception include Abraham, Isaac, Simeon, and Levi. The Torah does not prohibit lying if no one is harmed. Talmud The Talmud forbids lying or deceiving others: \\"The Holy One, blessed be He, hates a person which says one thing with his mouth and another in his heart\\" (Pesahim 113b) and also forbids fraud in business dealings: \\"As there is wronging in buying and selling, there is wronging with words. A man must not ask: ‚ÄòHow much is this thing?‚Äù if he has no intention of buying it\\" (Bava Metzia 4:10). Bava Metzia 23b-24a lists three exceptions where lying is permitted:Bava Metzia 23b-24a; the reasons in parentheses are specified by Rashi #It is permissible for a scholar to state he is unfamiliar with part of the Talmud, even if he is familiar (out of humility) #It is permissible to lie in response to intimate questions regarding one's marital life (as such things should be kept private) #Lying about hospitality received (to protect the host) Yevamot 65b states that \\"It is permitted to stray from the truth in order to promote peace\\", and Rabbi Natan further argues that this is obligatory. Later views Due to the principle of saving a life, in Jewish law it is required to lie to save a life, such as withholding a diagnosis from a seriously ill patient or concealing one's Jewish faith in a time of persecution of Jews. It may also be required to lie in other cases where an positive commandment would be violated by telling the truth, as positive commandments in Judaism usually take precedence against negative ones. Even in the cases where lying is acceptable, it is preferable to tell a technically true but deceptive statement or employ half-truth. It is also completely forbidden to lie habitually, to lie to a child (which would teach them that it was acceptable), and to lie in the court system. Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler redefined \\"truth\\" to mean any statement which serves God and \\"falsehood\\" to mean any statement that harms God's interests. This would radically change Jewish views on lying. According to Conservative rabbi Louis Jacobs, \\"the main thrust in the appeals for Jews to be truthful is in the direction of moral truth and integrity\\" although there is also \\"great significance to intellectual honesty\\". Reconstructionist rabbi Fred Scherlinder Dobb stated in an interview, \\"There is no justification whatsoever in Jewish tradition for lies which are either sloppy, systemic or self- serving... every word we utter should reflect our values, and one of the highest of those values is truth.\\" ReferencesSources  * * Category:Jewish ethics Category:Lying ","title":"Jewish views on lying"},{"id":"64971134","text":"Yehor Yarmolyuk (; born 1 March 2004) is a professional Ukrainian football midfielder.

This means that they give greater weight to the reduction of suffering than to the promotion of pleasure, happiness, or to other things that one might consider valuable. According to some suffering-focused ethics, we should concentrate exclusively on reducing preventable suffering. Other views can include additional features as the prevention of other disvalues or the promotion of other positive values while giving priority to reducing preventable suffering over them.Gloor, L.

Even though all these doctrines share this common general aim, they make different claims regarding how we should act. An example of these views is negative consequentialism, which claims that we should minimize suffering because a situation becomes better when there is less suffering in it. A form of negative consequentialism is negative utilitarianism, the view that we should aim at bringing about the least possible amount of aggregate suffering, adding up everyone's suffering as having equal value (no matter whose such suffering is).Animal Ethics (2014) \\"Negative Consequentialism\\", Ethics and Animals Other suffering-focused views can be, however, deontologic ethics, and claim, instead, that we have agent- relative reasons when reducing suffering. They will claim that reducing suffering has priority over other moral goals in all cases. This moral imperative would prevail in all cases, regardless of whether they cause a situation to be better or worse. Mayerfeld, J. (2002) Suffering and Moral Responsibility, Oxford: Oxford University Press. Finally, it can also be claimed that we should have dispositions in our character to behave as suffering reducers. Adams, Carol J. (1996) \\"Caring about Suffering: A Feminist Exploration\\", in Donovan, Josephine & Adams, Carol J. (eds.), Beyond Animal Rights: A Feminist Caring Ethic for the Treatment of Animals, Continuum, New York, 1996, pp. 170‚Äì196. Suffering-focused ethics used to be named as \\"negative\\", as they consider that the reduction of what is negative is more important than the promotion of what has positive value.Acton, H. B. & Watkins, J. W. N. (1963) \\"Symposium: Negative utilitarianism\\", Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, Supplementary Volumes, 37, pp. 83-114.Smart, R. N. (1958) \\"Negative utilitarianism\\", Mind, 67, pp. 542-543.Sikora, R. I. (1976) \\"Negative utilitarianism: Not dead yet\\", Mind, 85, pp. 587-588. This term continues to be used in naming positions such as negative consequentialism, negative prioritarianism or negative utilitarianism. However, the use of the term \\"suffering-focused ethics\\" has increased during the 21st century, as it informs more directly and clearly about the view it denotes. Suffering-focused ethics that are deontological or appeal to moral character (like care ethics) have not been named with the term \\"negative\\". Different suffering-focused ethics can also be distinguished depending on how much room they make for the consideration of values that differ from the reduction of suffering and to their relative importance with regards to the latter. According to some suffering-focused ethics there are no positive things in the world, only negative ones.Griffin, J. (1979) \\"Is unhappiness morally more important than happiness?\\", The Philosophical Quarterly, 29 (114), pp. 47-55. Other views, however, accept that there are things that have positive value but only as long as they avoid that we suffer.Gloor, L. (2017) \\"Tranquilism\\", Center on Long-Term Risk. Other positions, called lexical views, hold that no amount of other values can be more important than the reduction of suffering (lexicality in theory of value is the view that certain values trump over others). Gustaf Arrhenius & Wlodek Rabinowicz - 2015 - In Iwao Hirose & Jonas Olson (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of Value Theory. New York, USA: Oxford University Press USA. pp. 225-248. Ponderate views instead hold that, while the reduction of suffering is more important than other values, there can be some aggregate amount of other values such that its promotion may end up being more important than the reduction of a certain amount of suffering. Tomasik, B. (2013) \\"Three types of negative utilitarianism\\", Essays on Reducing Suffering  Arguments in favor of suffering focused ethics  Some philosophers have endorsed suffering-focused views because they consider that these are the only views that can solve some problems in the field of population ethics, in particular the asymmetry. According to this asymmetry, there is no obligation to bring into existence an individual who we can expect to have a good life, but there is an obligation not to bring into existence an individual who we can expect to have a bad life.Elstein, Daniel J. (2005) \\"The Asymmetry of Creating and Not Creating Life\\", The Journal of Value Inquiry, 39, 49‚Äì59. doi:10.1007/s10790-006-7256-4.Algander, Per (2012). \\"A Defence of the Asymmetry in Population Ethics\\", Res Publica, 18 (2): 145‚Äì57. doi:10.1007/s11158-011-9164-0Bradley, Ben (2013) \\"Asymmetries in Benefiting, Harming and Creating\\", The Journal of Ethics, 17,37‚Äì49. doi:10.1007/s10892-012-9134-6. It is possible to respond to this asymmetry by accepting that we do have an obligation to create happy lives or by accepting that we do not have an obligation not to create unhappy lives. Notwithstanding this, both options, especially the latter, seem to be highly counter- intuitive. The view that avoiding the creation of suffering has precedence over the promotion of happiness, however, gives us a very intuitive solution to this problem.Narveson, Jan (1978) \\"Future People and Us\\". In R. I. Sikora and Brian Barry, eds., Obligations to Future Generations, Philadelphia: Temple University Press. pp. 38‚Äì60.Frick, Johann David (2014) Making People Happy, Not Making Happy People': A Defense of the Asymmetry Intuition in Population Ethics, PhD Dissertation, Cambridge: Harvard University. The asymmetry exemplifies the intuition which many people have that it is permissible not to try to provide pleasure to others but instead, it is mandatory to avoid causing them to suffer. This idea is also defended by arguing that most of us reject that it would be correct to cause an unknown individual to enjoy some pleasure by causing another one to suffer a suffering that is only slightly lower in intensity or duration. Mayerfeld, J. (2002) Suffering and Moral Rresponsibility, Oxford: Oxford University Press. Another argument in favor of the reduction of suffering would be that suffering, including extreme suffering, is present in massive amounts in the world and can be easily produced, while bliss and extreme pleasure are much more scarce and hard to cause.Pearce, D. (2010) \\"Why be negative?\\", The Hedonistic Imperative. This view finds precedents in the positions held by Buddhists and by 19th century philosophers.Goodman, C. (2009) Consequences of compassion: An interpretation and Defense of Buddhist Ethics, Oxford: Oxford University Press.Schopenhauer, A. (2014) On the Suffering of the World, London: Penguin.

Life and career  Born in Breslau, Heidersbach first wanted to become a pianist and studied piano at the conservatory of her home town. She then took singing lessons with Juan Luria (who was later interned by the Nazi regime and murdered at the Sobibor extermination camp in 1943), Lola Beeth and Fred Husler. The soprano made her debut in 1922 at the Detmold's Stadttheater and was engaged by the Wroc≈Çaw Opera from 1924 to 1927. From 1927 to 1944, she was engaged at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden in Berlin.K√§the Heidersbach in the Gro√ües S√§ngerlexikon. Guest performances led the artist to Dresden, Amsterdam, Vienna, Zurich, Hamburg, Munich and Barcelona. She was engaged at the Bayreuth Festival from 1928 to 1934, where she sang Waldvogel, Freia, Gutrune, Elsa and Eva, and in 1934 a flower girl in the first Bayreuth new production of Parsifal since Richard Wagner's world premiere production.WagnerMania: Bayreuth-Besetzung Parsifal 1934, retrieved 17 August 2020.WagnerMania: Bayreuth-Besetzung Rheingold 1933, retrieved 17 August 2020. In 1934 she was appointed a Prussian Kammers√§ngerin at the Staatsoper Unter den Linden. According to Joseph Goebbels, however, she was not satisfied there, as she is said to have complained to him in March 1939 about too little singing time.Sven Felix Kellerhoff: html Goebbels and G√∂ring on the battlefield of the opera, Die Welt, 11 September 2012. On 2 June 1939, she sang Eve in a gala performance of Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg in honour of the Regent Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, which was also attended by Adolf Hitler. Herbert von Karajan was the conductor.Richard Osborne: Herbert Von Karajan: A Life in Music on WorldCat, Random House, 1999, This performance became legendary because Karajan, who conducted without a score, got out of time and thus incurred the wrath of the F√ºhrer. In September 1941, Heidersbach performed in occupied Krakow as \\"bearer of the German cultural will in the East\\", among other places at the Theater der SS und der Polizei there. At this occasion she had lunch with the Governor General Hans Frank.Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt 2007, , . Heidersbach's first marriage was to Johannes Eppinger. She entered her second marriage in 1928 with the Swedish opera singer Nils K√§lle who was engaged at the opera of Breslau from 1924 to 1927. After 1945, she worked as a concert soprano and teacher in Stockholm, where she had moved to. Heiersbach died in Kyrkhult, Olofstr√∂m Municipality, Sweden at the age of 82.

The Court of Criminal Appeal was an English appellate court for criminal cases established by the Criminal Appeal Act 1907.7 Edw. VII, c.23 It superseded the Court for Crown Cases Reserved to which referral had been solely discretionary and which could only consider points of law. Throughout the nineteenth century, there had been opposition from lawyers, judges and the Home Office against such an appeal court with collateral right of appeal. However, disquiet over the convictions of Adolf Beck and George Edalji led to the concession of a new court that could hear matters of law, fact or mixed law and fact.Cornish & Clarke (1989) p.619 Though the court was staffed with the judges who had shown such hostility (consisting of the Lord Chief Justice and eight judges of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court), it had a restraining effect on the excesses of prosecutors. During the period 1909‚Äì1912, there was an average of 450 annual applications for leave to appeal of which an average of 170 were granted. Of that 170, conviction was quashed in 20 percent of cases and sentence varied in another 22 per cent. Rulings of the court included limitation of the lower courts' ability simultaneously to try multiple defendants, multiple indictments and disparate counts within an indictment. The ability of the prosecution to introduce further evidence after the close of the prosecution case was curtailed as were several prejudicial practices with a defendant's previous criminal record. Further, trial judges' ability to invade the jury's role as trier of fact came under scrutiny, as did the practice of insisting that the defence proceed even in the case of an inadequate prima facie case by the prosecution. The Court also did much to refine and systematise the law of evidence.Cornish & Clarke (1989) p.620Davies (1949) On 1 October 1966, the Court of Criminal Appeal was superseded by the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales.Criminal Appeal Act 1966Lord Mackay of Clashfern (ed.)

Before becoming interim leader of the New Brunswick New Democratic Party, he worked for UPS and as a newspaper carrier in Fredericton. He currently is a hotel employee in Fredericton.  Political career  He first became involved with politics during the 2015 Alberta general election where Rachel Notley's Alberta New Democratic Party won a majority government. He later volunteered with the federal New Democratic Party during the 2015 Canadian federal election in the Fredericton area. During the 2018 New Brunswick general election, Thomason ran in New Maryland‚ÄîSunbury. Thomason was named interim leader of the New Brunswick New Democratic Party in March 2019. In 2019 federal election, he ran as the NDP candidate in Fredericton. Thomason led the New Brunswick NDP into the 2020 provincial election, he unsuccessfully ran in Fredericton North and the NDP did not win any seats in the legislature. Thomason had intended to only lead the party until a new leader was found. A leadership election that had been scheduled for August 2019 was postponed until June 2020 due to a lack of candidates and then was postponed again until April 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, when Premier Blaine Higgs called a snap election for September 14, 2020, he led the party through the election campaign, saying beforehand that he was in \\"a little bit of panic\\" at the prospects of leading the party in an election campaign, saying, \\"It wasn't something I ever thought of when I first signed up for the job.\\" Thomason positioned the party further to the left than in previous campaigns, in order to distinguish the party from the Green Party and the Liberals.

It was sold by M√©li√®s's Star Film Company and is numbered 1159‚Äì1165 in its catalogues, where it was advertised as a bouffonnerie extravagante (an \\"extravagant buffoonery\\"). Plot On the encouragement of his friend, a lodging-house janitor, a man goes to try his luck sparring a professional wrestler at a fair sideshow. He watches some of them at work, including a exaggeratedly sturdy woman wrestler who completely flattens her opponent. Finally he is pitted against an extremely tall wrestler, and manages to come out victorious. Production The French title, Le Conseil du pipelet, refers to the lodging- house janitor in the first scene; such janitors had been called \\"pipelets\\" in France since the publication of Eug√®ne Sue's The Mysteries of Paris (1842‚Äì43), where the name first appears. The film finds M√©li√®s reusing a bit of physical comedy, with a man flattened out like a pancake by means of a careful substitution splice, that he had already used in Fat and Lean Wrestling Match (1900) and An Adventurous Automobile Trip (1905). In turn, he would reuse the janitor's uniform in The Diabolic Tenant (1909). The film has been known to survive since at least the 1970s, when John Frazer's book Artificially Arranged Scenes described its action but misreported the French title as High- Life Taylor (the French title of a lost M√©li√®s film, Up-to-Date Clothes Cleaning). The confusion around the films' bilingual titles was cleared up in a Centre national de la cin√©matographie publication a few years later.

Known in history for her dedication and devotion to her family, she was vitally important to the success of the Yamauchi clan, a samurai clan under the leadership of her husband, Yamauchi Kazutoyo. It is said that she was responsible for stabilizing the predominance of the Yamauchi clan, and the formation of the Tosa domain. She was the daughter of Endo Morikazu, lord of Gujo-Hachiman castle. Her personal name is thought to have been Chiyo or Matsu, but there is no certainty. Becoming a Buddhist nun, she took the religious name of Kensh√¥in.  Life  Chiyo was the daughter of Endo Morikazu of Gujo-Hachiman castle, a retainer of Azai clan. When their lord, Azai Nagamasa, married Oichi (sister of Oda Nobunaga), the Azai and the Oda clan entered into a political alliance. Because of this alliance, she married Yamauchi Katzutoyo, a minor samurai who served Oda Nobunaga. At that time, marriages between samurai families were only of a political nature. Chiyo, from the series Instruction in the Fundamentals of Success, Woodblock print by Toshitaka Mizuno. When Chiyo married, her mother gave her a large sum of money - for \\"a matter of great importance\\". When Katzutoyo first left for war, he used to go to battle on foot or with an ordinary horse because he was in an inferior position in Oda's army. So Chiyo tried on her own to get a promotion for Katzutoyo, she gathered her fortune and traveled in search of a good horse. In times of war, it was rare to get a horse trained for battle due to intense demand. Chiyo spent her entire fortune on an extraordinary warhorse called Kagami Kurige. She did this right before a formal inspection of the troops by her overlord, Nobunaga. The investment was extremely worthwhile, because by using the horse Kazutoyo distinguished himself in battle. The horse won the admiration of Nobunaga, the most powerful warlord in Japan at the time. This led to the promotion of Kazutoyo and the growth of the Yamauchi clan's fortune. After these events, she continued to actively act for the growth and stabilization of her clan Chiyo's and her husband by Kobayashi Kiyochika. After Toyotomi Hideyoshi died, Japan entered a period of war again. Later, prior to the Battle of Sekigahara (1600), while Chiyo was held a political hostage by Ishida Mitsunari of Western army, she sent secret letters with important information to the Tokugawa Ieyasu's Eastern Army. Chiyo was forced to support Mitsunari while Kazutoyo was beside Ieyasu. She was taken hostage to force Kazutoyo to join the Western army, which is why Ieyasu suspected Yamauchi's loyalty. Although Chiyo was supervised by Ishida Mitsunari, she continued to send secret letters with important information, letting the Tokugawa's supporters know Mitsunari's raising of troops right before the Battle of Sekigahara. When sending letters to the Eastern army, she sent a letter to her husband saying, \\"Don't worry about me, do what you have to do.\\" Furthermore, she never allowed her husband to open the letter, she just asked him to hand it over to Ieyasu and show his loyalty. Thanks to Chiyo's sagacity, Kazutoyo won Ieyasu's credibility. The Yamauchi clan would be richly rewarded after the battle, when Ieyasu awarded Kazutoyo with Tosa Domain. It is often said that the foundation of Tosa domain was due to Chiyo's heroic actions. Kazutoyo exalted his wife by saying, \\"If it weren't for Chiyo, I would have never been able to make my name known in this country.\\" Yamauchi Kazutoyo never took a concubine, though it was a known tradition for samurai, and he never left Chiyo although she was only able to have one child, a girl named Yonehime. Chiyo survived the entire Sengoku period, dying in 1617, two years after the Siege of Osaka. Statue of Yamauchi Chiyo and the warhorse.  Legacy  Chiyo and Kazutoyo are one of the most celebrated samurai couples in Japan. Their loyalty and their determination to survive the period of war have eternalized the couple in history. Due to her virtuous character, Chiyo was honored in paintings, poems and popular culture. Reproductions of Chiyo's image can be found in a number of places; a bronze statue of her and the horse she gave her husband, which stands near the ascent to Kochi Castle, close a statue of her husband on horseback and full armor; a bronze status of her, holding the reins of the horse, and her husband, located in the park below Gujo Hachiman castle in Gifu Prefecture; and a portrait of her in retirement, wearing the garb of a Bhikkhuni.

The village is located on both sides of the river Aƒ£e, 18 km away from the municipality of Ragana and 64 km from Riga, the capital of Latvia. Lƒìdurga consists of parish administration, elementary school, House of Culture, sport center, Lƒìdurga's Lutheran church, dendrological park and open- air stage. Lƒìdurga is the birthplace of the Baltic German activist and writer Garlieb Merkel, the author of Die Letten (\\"The Latvians\\"), the book which first drew attention to the Latvians as more than just peasants.  History Lƒìdurga (Letthegore, Lettegore, Ledegore) was first mentioned in the Livonian Chronicle of Henry in connection with events in the spring of the year 1211, when the Ridalians and the people of Saaremaa destroyed Bishop Albert's Livonian lands, including Lƒìdurga. William of Modena, the papal legate, conducted Christian worship for Livonians in the village church in 1225. Lƒìdurga was joined with Turaida in a single Lƒìdurga-Turaida congregation municipality in 1589. The village is formed around the center of the former Lƒìdurga manor (\\"Loddiger\\"). In 1932 Lƒìdurga obtained densely populated village status. Education The elementary school was established in 1871. On 21 July 1998 the school was renamed the Garlieb Merkel Elementary School to honor the Baltic German writer Garlieb Helwig Merkel since Lƒìdurga was his birthplace in 1769. The school has its own flag, symbol, and song by J. Ozoli≈Üa and L.

In the old days, the Aƒ£e was used as an internal traffic and trade route. In the 13th century, the Livonian Chronicle of Henry mentioned the Aƒ£e under the name of Adya (Livonian for \\"edge\\") in stories about Livonian battles against German intruders. In the village center next to the Lƒìdurga manor house, a dam was built, forming a pond that in the past was used for running the watermill. The watermill buildings and dams are still preserved but no longer in use. Lƒìdurga dendrological park Lƒìdurga dendrological park was established in 1973 by one person, Arvƒ´ds Janitens (1923-2009). A short documentary about him and the park was made in Latvian.. In 1993 dendrologists of the National Botanical Garden recognized 939 tree and bush species and varieties, but currently, the number exceeds a thousand. Many events such as Walpurgis Night, Easter, Midsummer eve and others are celebrated in the park. Culture=The house of culture Lƒìdurga's house of culture was built in 1973. In the same year the building was burned down by an accidental fire. Reconstruction took 9 years. In 1981 the heating in the building was provided and the first kolkhoz \\"Draudzƒ´ba\\" (\\"Friendship\\") events took place. The official opening took place on 29 May 1982. Previous managers were Karolis Treijs, Baiba Adamoviƒça, Didzis Tr≈´bs, Dzintra Sapule, Mareks Motte; from January 2007 the manager has been Ilze Runce.

History=Formation The UOPWA of private sector clerical workers formed in 1937 when 23 white collar unions merged, including the Office Workers Union, and the Bookkeepers, Stenographers, and Accountants Union (BS & AU). They also left the left the American Federation of Labor (AFL) for the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO). Activities \\"The UOPWA held an unusual position in the newly formed CIO. In a federation committed to industrial unionism, here was a union with elements of both craft and industrial structure.\\" \\"The union included a substantial group of leftwing activists and sympathizers.\\" In the 1930s-1940s, Communist-swayed unions in the CIO included UOPWA, International Fur and Leather Workers Union (IFLWU); the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union (ILWU); the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America (UE); the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (IUMUSW); the United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA); the Food, Tobacco, Agricultural, and Allied Workers (FTA); the Farm Equipment Workers (FE); the United Public Workers (UPW); the American Communications Association (ACA); the International Fishermen and Allied Workers of America (IFAWA); and the National Union of Marine Cooks and Stewards (NUMCS). As early as 1938, UOPWA leadership came under Communist domination, when they suspended Anne Gould, editor of the Progressive Office Worker, who took 500 members of UOPWA Local 16 out and joined the AFL's Bookkeepers, Stenographers and Accountants Union. UOPWA's office workers were principally employees of the ILGWU, the Workmen's Circle, the League for Industrial Democracy, Union Health Center, Labor Committee for Palestine, the Non-Sectarian Anti-Nazi League, and the Workmens Sick and Death Benefit Fund. In 1941, Maxwell Copelof, a New York State government official and private arbitrator, represented Amalgamated Bank in Amalgamated Bank of New York vs. United Office and Professional Workers of America, Local 16 (UOPWA) on the issue of job assignment. On November 3, 1946, UOPWA won a strike for higher wages against Merchants Bank of New York. In 1947-1949, UOPWA leadership refused to sign non-Communist affidavits as required by the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. On November 25, 1948, Local 16 denounced CIO president Philip Murray for proposing dissolution of UOPWA's national leadership due to \\"Communist proclivities\\" of Union 16. Dissolution In 1949-1950, the CIO expelled the UOPWA due to Communist domination. Aftermath Shortly after expulsion from the CIO, UOPWA merged with two other unions to create the Distributive, Processing, and Office Workers of America (DPOWA). Internal disputes and political pressures brought about DPOWA's demise by 1954. In April 1950, insurance workers followed Allan Haywood under a new Insurance and Allied Workers Organizing Committee; Richard T. Leonard succeeded Haywood. In 1953, these insurance workers held a convention in Cleveland to form a new union, the Insurance Workers of America. Also in 1950, the old Consumers Union emerged from the UOPWA to join District 65 of the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Workers Union . During the 1950s, some Consumers Union members protested the change and narrowly (66 to 57 votes) won new membership under the Newspaper Guild of New York. Membership UOPWA's membership was largely female and included people with small manufacturers, insurance, banks (e.g., Bankers Trust ), finance, and direct mail. It also included professional workers such as engineers as well as more than 300 members of the Consumers Union. Membership peaked in 1948 with 75,000 members in 100 locals in cities nationwide, though centered in New York City. Insurance workers alone included 40,000 people, of whom 90% were insurance agents. Members included Vicki Garvin (1915-2007), a champion of African American and women's rights who served as UOPWA's research director and was also a member of the National Negro Congress (1945) and of the Communist Party USA (1947). Confusion with UPWA UOPWA was not the same as the United Public Workers of America (UPWA) (1946‚Äì1952), a fellow CIO member, also expelled from the CIO in 1950.

The twelfth tropical cyclone, seventh named storm, third hurricane, and second major hurricane of the ongoing 2020 Pacific hurricane season, Genevieve formed from a tropical wave that the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first started monitoring on August 10. The wave merged with a trough of low pressure on August 13, and favorable conditions allowed the wave to intensify into Tropical Depression Twelve-E at 15:00 UTC. Just six hours later the depression became a tropical storm and was given the name Genevieve. Genevieve quickly become a hurricane by August 17, and Genevieve began explosive intensification the next day. By 12:00 UTC on August 18, Genevieve reached its peak intensity with winds of 130 mph and a pressure of 950 mbar. Genevieve began to weaken the next day possibly due to cooler waters caused by Hurricane Elida, earlier that month. Genevieve weakened below tropical storm status around 18:00 UTC on August 20, as it passed close to Baja California Sur. Soon after, Genevieve began to lose its deep convection and became a post-tropical cyclone by 21:00 UTC on August 21, eventually dissipating off the coast of Southern California late on August 24. Hurricane-force gusts affected parts of Baja California as Genevieve passed close by. Several inches of rain caused flooding near Cabo San Lucas on August 20. A total of six deaths were attributed to Genevieve across Mexico. Meteorological history On August 10, a disturbance to the west of Central America began to be monitored by the NHC. On August 13, this disturbance developed into a trough of low pressure southwest of Mexico. The disturbance gradually organized, and on August 16, the system became a tropical depression, receiving the designation Twelve-E at 15:00 UTC. The depression rapidly strengthened and became a tropical storm 6 hours later at 21:00 UTC, receiving the name Genevieve. Genevieve continued to strengthen rapidly overnight and became a hurricane on August 17, reaching 1-minute winds of 75 mph (120 km/h). Genevieve continued to intensify quickly, and on the next day, at 09:00 UTC, Genevieve explosively intensified into a Category 3 major hurricane. Three hours later, Genevieve intensified further into a Category 4 hurricane, and formed a very well-defined and clear eye. Afterward, Genevieve gradually began to weaken, dropping to Category 3 intensity by 03:00 UTC on August 19, possibly due to encountering a cold wake left by Hurricane Elida. Genevieve continued a gradual weakening trend for the next several hours, but later that day, data from an NHC Reconnaissance Flight indicated that Genevieve was rapidly weakening, with the storm dropping to Category 1 status by 21:00 UTC that day. On August 20, Genevieve turned northwestward and passed very close to Cabo San Lucas, at the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula, and the system weakened further into a tropical storm at 18:00 UTC. By 21:00 UTC on August 21, Genevieve had degenerated into a post-tropical cyclone, after having no deep convection for 12 hours. Hurricane Genevieve's remnant low continued to persist for another few days, stalling off the coast of Southern California on August 23. Genevieve's remnant low dissipated by 00:00 UTC on August 25. Preparations and impact=Mexico As Hurricane Genevieve rapidly intensified on August 17, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm watch for southern areas of Baja California Sur. This was later raised to a tropical storm warning the next day, and a hurricane warning on August 19. These advisories were subsequently discontinued as the storm weakened and moved away from the Baja California Peninsula on August 21. An estimated 8 million people were threatened by the hurricane across the west coast of Mexico. Accordingly, approximately 1,600 shelters were opened nationwide: 571 in Jalisco, 434 in Nayarit, 237 in Colima, 179 in Michoac√°n, and 175 in Baja California Sur. Even without officials aking residents to do so, residents of Baja California prepared for damaging winds. Thunderstorms associated with the outer bands of Genevieve produced gusty winds and heavy rain in Oaxaca, with accumulations averaging and gusts reaching . Four people were killed in the state: two from landslides in Huautla de Jim√©nez and two from swollen rivers. Water reached a depth of in Puerto √Ångel. The Caminos y Aeropistas de Oaxaca deployed 32 personnel to repair damage to roads. Emergency declarations were issued for 13 municipalities. Localized flash flooding impacted parts of Acapulco, with cars washed away and some homes inundated. Large swells impacted the coast of Jalisco. Fourteen families relocated in Cihuatl√°n. Heavy rainfall impacted much of Baja California Sur as Genevieve brushed the state; accumulations peaked at in Cabo San Lucas. In the mountainous terrain south of Cabo San Lucas, wind gusts reached . Electrical and road infrastructure was damaged statewide, and some areas were without power for more than 24 hours. A lifeguard drowned while attempting to save a teen who also died after ignoring warning flags prompted by rough surf produced by Genevieve, at a resort in Cabo San Lucas. On August 23, the Coordinaci√≥n Nacional de Protecci√≥n Civil declared a state of emergency for the municipalities of La Paz and Los Cabos. This allowed the distribution of government aid and supplies to affected residents. Heavy machinery was used to clear roads of debris and mud left behind by floods. United States On August 22, moisture from Hurricane Genevieve's remnants brought heavy rainfall to parts of Southern California and Arizona. On August 22‚Äì23, the windfield from Genevieve's remnants also caused many waves above on the west coast of the Baja California Peninsula and the Southern California.

Kibera Community Library is surrounded by over 25 primary schools, 4 secondary schools and a tertiary college. The Library, which receives over 500 visitors daily, is an invaluable resource for schools when it comes to implementing the Social Pillars of the Kenya. One of the key projects offered by the Kibera Community Library is ‚ÄúKids on the Tab‚Äù project which was started in 2012. The main objective of the project was to meet and stimulate the desire for education among the younger population of the slum area and to match opportunities for children from poor families to interact with technology to advance their learning and improve school performance. The library also often holds reading campaigns for children within the slum area.

He is also credited as a singer, painter, art collector, dealer, and cultural administrator. Valente was born in Calabria, Italy where he trained as a fine artist and opera singer. In 1927, he immigrated to the United States where he performed opera in public. However, his singing career did not take off and he pivoted to focus on his photography. In 1931, he became the photographer for the newly formed Group Theater, an experimental theater company based in New York co- founded by Lee Strasberg. By the mid-1930s, Valente was regularly published by magazines and newspapers, most notably Stage, a magazine dedicated to Broadway theater. Valente was lauded as one of the leading theater photographers of the day and his use of artistic camera angles and dramatic lighting became his signature. He also became known for portraying actors and dancers in costume, but not while performing. In addition to Broadway, Valente photographed American Ballet Theatre (then known as Ballet Theatre) during the company's formative years during the 1940s. He photographed some of Ballet Theatre's most prominent dancers, such as Harold Lang, John Kriza, Alicia Alonso, Nora Kaye, Vera Zorina, Igor Yousketvitch, Alicia Markova, Maria Tallchief, Andr√© Eglevsky, and Hugh Laing. Valente also extensively photographed the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo when choreographer L√©onide Massine created his most famous works. By 1937, he became the choice photographer at the New York Times. He also worked as a contract photographer for Columbia Pictures, shooting publicity images, sporadically from 1935-37. In addition to a photographer, he was an avid collector of American art which he bought with the profits from sale of his photography. He developed close friendships with modern painters whom he considered the best of their day including Raphael Soyer, John Sloan, Thomas Hart Benton, Reginald Marsh, and Abraham Walkowitz. In 1943, he independently produced the short film \\"Art Discovers America\\" to patriotically celebrate these American artists and their contributions to the art world at large. The film was distributed by MGM and later turned into a longer form educational film titled \\"Grandpa Called It Art\\" (1944). According to his obituary, he coined the term \\"American Masters\\". Valente died in 1973 at his home on Long Island at age 74. Several repositories in the United States hold Valente's archival papers and photographs including The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, Archives of American Art, and The Museum of Modern Art.

He also wrote on drawings, and became a Fellow of the Royal Society. Life Born on 2 August 1711, he was second surviving son of William and Isabella Rogers of Dean Street, Soho, London. In May 1731 he was placed in the custom house under William Townson, from whom he acquired a taste for the fine arts and book-collecting. Townson, the head in the Customs Office of the Certificate Office, collected books and prints. Townson left his estate to Rogers in 1740, a bequest which included a house at 3 Laurence Pountney Lane, London, containing a museum of art treasures. Here Rogers in 1746 took up residence. There were other houses left to him, one in Mark Lane, London, and the other in Richmond, Surrey. In 1747 he became clerk of the certificates. Through his friend Arthur Pond, Rogers was elected Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London on 23 February 1752, and served on its council. He became Fellow of the Royal Society on 17 November 1757. Rogers built up a print collection, with the help of friends, particular of Horatio Paul who lived abroad, and whose father Robert was a customs official, and Robert Udny. He was well connected in artistic and antiquarian circles. He died unmarried on 2 January 1784, and was buried in the Laurence Pountney churchyard. Works The major work by Rogers was a series of facsimiles of original drawings from the masters, \\"engraved in tint\\" (mezzotint or aquatint, probably with etching). The book was issued in 1778, with the title A Collection of Prints in Imitation of Drawings ‚Ä¶ to which are annexed Lives of their Authors, with Explanatory and Critical Notes, 2 vols. imperial folio. The 112 plates were engraved mainly by Francesco Bartolozzi, William Wynne Ryland, James Basire, and Simon Watts, from drawings some of which were in Rogers's own collection. Other prominent collectors that had their works reproduced in the project included Thomas Hudson. There were Raphael drawings used, from the collection of Joshua Reynolds. From the collection of Niccol√≤ Gabburri, there were facsimiles of drawings that Rogers had acquired, in the 1762 sale by the dealer William Kent. One living artist was included, Vieira Lusitano. In 1782 Rogers published an anonymous blank- verse translation of Dante's Inferno. He also contributed to Arch√¶ologia and The Gentleman's Magazine. Legacy and the Cotton Collection Rogers's collections passed at his death to William Cotton (d. 1791), who married his sister and heiress, and from him descended to his son, William Cotton, F.S.A., of the custom house. He then sold by auction in 1799 and 1801 a considerable portion of the collection; the sale occupied 24 days, and realised ¬£3,886 10s. William Cotton 1794‚Äì1863, F.S.A. The remainder, on Cotton's death in 1816, became the property of his son, William Cotton, who died in 1863. John Cotton (1802‚Äì1849), the ornithologist in Australia, was his younger brother. William Cotton matriculated at Exeter College, Oxford in 1811, aged 17, graduating B.A. in 1814, and M.A. in 1818. (He did not go into the church, as Alumni Oxonienses claims: the mistaken identity, confusion with William Cotton (died 1853) who was the son of Sir Robert Salusbury Cotton, 5th Baronet is pointed out in the Clergy of the Church of England database.) He lived at the Priory, Leatherhead, Surrey, and Highland House, Ivybridge, Devon. He published a catalogue of the Rogers collection in 1836; also on Plympton Erle and the family background of Joshua Reynolds, and Totnes; and was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. After making some additions to the collection, Cotton handed it over in two instalments, in 1852 and 1862, to the proprietors of the Plymouth Public Library. An apartment was built for it, and was opened to the public on 1 June 1853 by the name of the Cottonian Library. The collection was moved in 1916 to the Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery. The collection included four portraits by Sir Joshua Reynolds, about five thousand prints, a few fine examples of early typography, illuminated manuscripts of the fifteenth century, carvings, models, casts, bronzes, and medals. A catalogue of the first part of the benefaction, compiled by Llewellynn Frederick William Jewitt, was printed in 1853.

History The manifesto was developed during the National Black Economic Development Conference held in Detroit, Michigan in 1969. American civil rights activist James Forman presented the first draft of the manifesto on April 26, 1969, receiving the support of the conference in a 187-63 vote of delegates. Demands The manifesto made the argument that much of America had been built with Black slave labor, and that churches and synagogues had implicitly played a role in facilitating that process. Its opening paragraph read: > We the black people assembled in Detroit, Michigan for the National Black > Economic Development Conference are fully aware that we have been forced to > come together because racist white America has exploited our resources, our > minds, our bodies, our labor. For centuries we have been forced to live as > colonized people inside the United States, victimized by the most vicious, > racist system in the world. We have helped to build the most industrial > country in the world. The text of the manifesto demanded $500 million USD in donations from churches and synagogues, to be routed to a specific group of organizations, some of which had yet to be formed. The largest demand was for the creation of a $200 million USD land bank in the American South, in order \\"to help our brothers and sisters who have to leave their land because of racist pressure for people who want to establish cooperative farms\\". USD $40 million was to be divided equally among four publishing and printing companies serving the Black communities of Detroit, Atlanta, Los Angeles and New York. Four television networks, meant \\"as an alternative to racist propaganda\\" were to be established with $10 million USD each, in Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland and Washington, D.C.. $30 million would go to the establishment of a research center into the social problems faced by African-Americans. $130 million was designated to begin a Black university in the American south. Publication Forman presented the manifesto to the public on May 4, 1969 at New York City's Riverside Church, interrupting a Sunday service to do so. The day earlier, Forman had requested and been denied permission to speak, by the minister Rev. Dr. Ernest Campbell. Trying to prevent Forman's speech, Campbell directed the organist to play and also began a silent walkout of congregants. The church obtained a civil restraining order against Foreman the same week. The manifesto was also read out loud on May 4 at the First United Presbyterian Church of San Francisco. It was later published in the July 10, 1969 edition of the New York Review of Books. Outcomes The manifesto's demands were ultimately rejected by most churches and synagogues. A few churches made donations to the organizations mentioned in the manifesto, and several reassessed their processes to ensure equal opportunity to people of color. On August 29, 1969 Time Magazine wrote that \\"Since Forman first issued his arrogantly worded 'Black Manifesto' in Detroit last April, only an estimated $22,000 has trickled into the coffers of his National Black Economic Development Conference. Forman's demands have been successful, however, as a catalyst in moving churches to examine their consciences.\\" ReferencesExternal links Category:Civil rights in the United States Category:Manifestos Category:Reparations for slavery Category:1969 documents ","title":"Black Manifesto"},{"id":"64972076","text":"Bernd Weber (born 22 July 1976, Bonn) is a German clinical neuroscientist and neurologist at the Center for Economics and Neuroscience CENs in Bonn.

It is a widely distributed, common species that grows on rocks. Taxonomy The lichen was first formally described by German botanist Georg Franz Hoffmann in 1796, as Verrucaria badia. It has been shuffled between several genera in its taxonomic history, and has been associated with many synonyms. In 1986, Austrian lichenologist Josef Hafellner transferred it to the newly created genus Protoparmelia, in which it is the type species. Description The thallus of Protoparmelia badia ranges in colour from pale to deep greyish-brown to yellowish brown. It has a texture that is areolate (a pattern of block-like areas similar to cracked dried mud) to verrucose (covered with wartlike projections), and is shiny. Its apothecia are lecanorine (shaped like a plate with a ring around them), and typically measure 0.7‚Äì1.5 mm in diameter. The discs are dark red-brown and shiny, while the smooth outer rim is paler. The spores made by this lichen are spindle- shaped (slightly pointed at both ends), measuring 10‚Äì16 by 3‚Äì7 Œºm. Habitat and distribution Protoparmelia badia is a widespread and common lichen with a circumpolar and arctic-alpine distribution. It is found in western and northeastern North America, mountainous areas of Asia, Europe, temperate South America, Australasia, and Antarctica. It grows on hard, exposed acidic rocks, including granite, basalt and other volcanic rock, rhyolite, and sandstone.

It was signed at Rio de Janeiro on 23 November 1826. Exchange of ratifications took place on 13 March 1827, and the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed legislation on 2 July 1827 to enforce the treaty (Slave Trade, Convention with Brazil Act 1827, 7 & 8 Geo. 4 c. 74). In 1827, Emperor Pedro I presented the treaty to the Chamber of Deputies for its approval; its Committee for Diplomacy and Statistics approved the convention by three votes to two. In response, on 2 July 1827, deputy Raimundo Jos√© da Cunha Mattos, a member of the Committee who opposed the treaty, delivered a two hour speech in defence of the continuation of the slave trade. The treaty provided that it would be illegal for any subject of the Empire of Brazil to be engaged in carrying out the African slave trade. It provided a three year grace period after the exchange of ratifications, which meant that the ban took effect on 13 March 1830. The United Kingdom had mediated the Treaty of Rio de Janeiro (1825) by which Portugal recognised the independence of Brazil; the UK had made a commitment from Brazil to abolish the slave trade a condition of its support in securing recognition of Brazil's independence, and this treaty was agreed in fulfilment of that commitment. Although the treaty was supported by Emperor Pedro I, it did not have widespread popular support in Brazil; as a result, the Brazilian government largely failed to enforce the treaty, and the slave trade to Brazil continued despite the treaty's ban. In response, the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the Aberdeen Act of 1845, which authorised British warships to board Brazilian ships and seize any found to be involved in the slave trade.

In 1928, after a failed business venture, her father, William, moved his family to Berlin. There Picker graduated from the Paul-Natorp-Gymasium and later attended the Lette-Verein. After fleeing Germany following the rise of Hitler, the family resettled in New York, where Picker studied drawing and painting with Alexander Brook and Louis Bouch√© at the Art Students League of New York while pursuing a career as a shoe designer. At the age of sixteen, she became the first woman designer hired by I. Miller, a shoe company. In 1952 Picker opened her own business called \\"Simone Shoes To Match\\" with her brother Regi Simon, designing and manufacturing shoes for women to match their handbags and dresses. In the October 1952 issue of MaCall‚Äôs, her shoes were illustrated by a then 24 year old Andy Warhol. In the 1960's she formed one of the first shoe import businesses in the US, and designed her own line, ‚ÄúSimone Shoes, Made in Italy.‚Äù In 1982, Picker retired from shoe design to care for her then-ailing husband, Julian Picker. Soon thereafter, in 1983, Picker was commissioned to create the cover for the January 1983 issue of Footwear News. Over the course of her career, Picker patented numerous shoe designs. Picker produced the bulk of her paintings in her nineties. Her first solo exhibition was at the age of 95 at The Hudson River Studio in 2012, and shortly after was the subject of a retrospective exhibition at PMW Gallery in March 2013. She subsequently had solo exhibitions at The Cooperstown Art Association and View Arts in Old Forge, NY. She also exhibited at the Waxlander Gallery in Santa Fe and the Carter Burden Gallery in Chelsea. Picker's final years were almost entirely focused upon portraiture, including Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Mikael Karlsson (composer), Richard Croft (tenor), Ida Rohatyn, and Charles Wuorinen.

Biography  Ana Cairo Ballester was born in Havana in 1949. Her father was a mechanic, and her mother was a housewife. Her early years were marked by the massive upheaval of the Cuban Revolution. As a young teenager in 1962, she traveled to Baracoa to work harvesting coffee, but her work was interrupted by the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1964, she began high school at the newly founded Ra√∫l Cepero Bonilla Special Pre-University Institute, where she first became interested in the humanities. In 1967 she enrolled at the University of Havana, where she received a doctorate in philology in 1985. Cairo was a longtime professor in the Faculty of Arts and Letters at the University of Havana, where she began teaching in 1973 after completing her undergraduate studies. She led the department's instruction on Cuban literature and taught multiple subjects, including an annual seminar on Jose Mart√≠. She was known as a deeply knowledgeable professor; intimidating despite her casual uniform; an old-school scholar who never used a typewriter, much less a computer. As her colleague Pedro Pablo Rodr√≠guez wrote: > \\"With professorial wisdom‚Äîand not without a certain malice, I would say‚ÄîAna > would open a book and ask unimaginable exam questions from it: calling on > students to recount specific episodes from the fictional texts, attitudes of > the characters, the human problems demonstrated in the stories. ... In > truth, Ana taught her students how to read and how to think.\\" She was a prominent figure in the Cuban literary scene, serving as a member of the Cuban Academy of History, on the advisory board of the Fundaci√≥n Alejo Carpentier, and on the board of directors of the Fundaci√≥n Fernando Ortiz. She was also a member of the Caribbean Studies Association and the Association of Historians of Latin America and the Caribbean, and she frequently traveled abroad to teach on Cuban literature and culture in such countries as Mexico, Panama, France, and Spain. She received the National Prize for Social Sciences and Humanities in 2015. In 1975, Cairo received July 26 Prize for the essay that would become her first book, El movimiento de Veteranos y Patriotas. She went on to publish some 20 books, including several anthologies, as well as numerous essays in both Cuban and international periodicals. She created the weekly Radio Havana Cuba show Contrapunteo and served on the editorial boards of various Cuban magazines, including Temas, Universidad de La Habana, Debates Americanos, and Revista de la Biblioteca Nacional Jos√© Mart√≠. She had one son, Carlos Enrique del Toro Cairo. Cairo died in 2019 in Havana, at age 69. In 2020, the 29th annual Cuban International Book Fair in Havana was dedicated in her honor.

It had been traditionally considered the direct consequence of a raid by bandits in Akkar against the tribute caravan of Ibrahim Pasha, then Egypt's outgoing governor, who was on his way to Constantinople. Modern research indicates that the tribute caravan arrived intact and that the expedition was instead the culmination of Ottoman attempts to subjugate the Druze and other tribal groups in Mount Lebanon dating from 1518. In 1523‚Äì1524 dozens of Druze villages were burned in the Chouf area and hundreds of Druze were killed or captured by the governor Khurram Pasha, after which a period of peace ensued. Tensions resumed in the 1560s as Druze and non-Druze local dynasties, particularly the Ma'ns, Assafs and Shihabs acquired large quantities of prohibited firearms, which were often superior to those possessed by government troops. Military action by the Ottoman governors of Damascus in the 1570s failed to disarm the chiefs and the general population or collect tax arrears, which had been building up from the 1560s. Ibrahim Pasha was appointed to \\"rectify the situation\\" in the Levant in 1583 and launched the expedition against the Druze of Mount Lebanon in the summer of 1585 as a Porte-ordered diversion from his Constantinople- bound caravan. He mobilized about 20,000 soldiers, including the Janissaries of Egypt and Damascus, as well as local chieftains, namely the Bedouin Mansur ibn Furaykh and Druze rivals of the Ma'ns. Hundreds of Druze rebels were slain, thousands of muskets were confiscated and large sums of money were collected as tax arrears by Ibrahim Pasha. The Ma'nid chief Qurqumaz, one of the principal targets of the expedition, died in hiding after refusing to surrender. The following year the governor of Damascus, Ali Pasha, captured the chieftains of the local Assaf, Harfush, Tanukh and Furaykh dynasties and sent them to Constantinople. They were afterward returned to their home regions and confirmed in their tax farms. The expedition and its aftermath marked a turning point in Ottoman governance of the Levant as local chieftains were thenceforth frequently appointed as sanjak-beys (district governors). One such governor was a son of Qurqumaz, Fakhr al-Din II, who became the most powerful local force in the Levant from his appointments to the sanjaks of Sidon-Beirut and Safad in the 1590s and 1602, respectively, until his downfall in 1633. Sources The source used for the 1585 expedition by 19th-century chroniclers from Mount Lebanon and modern historians was the account of the Maronite patriarch and historian Istifan al-Duwayhi, which dates to . Duwayhi's version attributes the cause of the campaign to a raid of the Constantinople-bound tribute caravan of Egypt's governor Ibrahim Pasha by bandits in Jun Akkar, a coastal area north of Tripoli. Duwayhi's account was reproduced almost identically by the 19th-century, Lebanon-based chroniclers Haydar al-Shihabi (d. 1835) and Tannus al-Shidyaq (d. 1859). Their accounts were the principal source used for the event by the modern historians Peter Malcolm Holt, Abdul Karim Rafeq, Kamal Salibi and Muhammad Adnan Bakhit. The year of the caravan raid was cited as 1584 by Duwayhi, and then by Rafeq, Salibi and Bakhit, while Shihabi, and in turn Holt, placed the raid in 1585. Modern research by the historian Abdul-Rahim Abu-Husayn in the 1980s suggests that the Jun Akkar raid did not occur and that successive government‚ÄìDruze hostilities from the 1520s onward culminated with the 1585 government expedition. Abu-Husayn based his reassessment of the events on contemporary and near contemporary sources, namely Ottoman government records, the accounts of the Ottoman historian Mustafa Selaniki (d. 1600), the Italian historian and traveller Giovanni Tomasso Minadoi (d. 1615) and the Damascene historians Shams al-Din Muhammad ibn Tulun (d. 1576), al-Hasan al-Burini (d. 1615) and Ahmad al-Qaramani (). Background The Chouf mountains The Ottoman Empire conquered the Levant from the Mamluks following the Battle of Marj Dabiq near Aleppo in 1516. The Ottoman sultan Selim I largely preserved the Mamluk governing structures and officials of the region. His beylerbey (provincial governor) over Damascus, Janbirdi al-Ghazali, had served the same role under the Mamluks. After Janbirdi declared himself sultan following Selim's death in 1520, the Ottomans stamped out his revolt and began to incorporate the Levant more firmly into the empire's structures. The most significant challenge for the Sublime Porte (imperial Ottoman government in Constantinople) in the Levant had been the subjugation of its eastern desert and western mountainous peripheries. Selim had entrusted the pacification of Bedouin tribes and the security of the Hajj pilgrimage route between Damascus and Mecca to the powerful Sunni Muslim Bedouin dynasties of the Beqaa Valley and Jabal Nablus, the Hanash and Tarabay, respectively. The area of Mount Lebanon and the port towns of Sidon and Beirut became administratively part of the Sidon-Beirut Sanjak, a district of Damascus Eyalet. Sidon-Beirut was administratively divided into the nahiyas (subdistricts) of Beirut and Sidon along the coast, and the following nine nahiyas in the mountainous parts of the sanjak: from north to south, the Keserwan, the Matn, the Jurd, the Gharb, Iqlim al-Kharrub, three nahiyas collectively known as the Chouf and Iqlim al-Tuffah. The nahiyas of the Matn, the Jurd, the Gharb and the Chouf were predominantly inhabited by Druze, followers of an 11th-century offshoot of Isma'ili Shia Islam. The Druze peasant tribesmen of southern Mount Lebanon proved challenging for the authorities to pacify, and a provincial law code from Sultan Suleiman's reign (1520‚Äì1566) referenced them as a \\"misguided folk where each follows his own cult\\" and from whom tax collection was difficult. The Druze were officially considered Muslims by the Ottomans for taxation purposes, though they were not viewed as genuine Muslims by the authorities or the Sunni Muslim ulema (religious establishment). Members of the community had to pretend to be of the Sunni Muslim faith to attain any official post, were occasionally forced to pay the jizya (poll tax) reserved for Christians and Jews, and were the target of condemnatory treatises and fatwas (edicts) by the ulema of Damascus. The Druze were likewise suspicious of the Ottomans. In their consistent efforts to counter their incorporation into the administrative and fiscal system, the Druze benefited from a rugged terrain, possession of firearms and sectarian and tribal cohesion, making it difficult to impose government authority in the Druze areas. Consequently, the Ottoman presence in the Druze areas, as well as the non-Druze nahiyas of Sidon-Beirut, was negligible for much of the 16th and 17th centuries, during which time local chieftains, Druze and Muslim alike, governed the area through iltizam (limited-term tax farms). Ostensibly, the appointed holders of iltizams, called multazims, were to remit taxes to the government and undertake official military duties; the local multazims did neither and were more powerful than the occasional government- appointed sanjak-bey (district governor). Druze‚ÄìOttoman hostilities before 1585 The first known government action against the Druze occurred in 1518 during the rebellion of Nasir al-Din, the Hanash chieftain and the sanjak-bey of Sidon-Beirut, against Selim. The rebellion was suppressed by Janbirdi, who arrested and executed Nasir al-Din and captured the latter's Druze allies, the chiefs Qurqumaz, Zayn al-Din and Alam al-Din Sulayman from the Chouf-based Ma'n family and Sharaf al-Din Yahya of the Gharb-based Tanukh-Buhtur family. The four Druze chiefs were released after paying a heavy fine. The beylerbey of Damascus, Khurram Pasha, launched a punitive expedition against the Chouf Druze led by the Ma'nid chiefs in 1523. Forty-three Druze villages, including Barouk, the headquarters of Qurqumaz, were burned and Ibn Tulun reported that Khurram Pasha returned to Damascus with four camel loads of Druze heads and Druze religious literature proving the religion's hostility to Sunni Islam. The expedition represented the first attempt to impose direct government authority in the Chouf. Khurram Pasha followed up by appointing subashis (police superintendents) to enforce law and order in the area, but they were killed by the Druze. Khurram Pasha responded by launching a second punitive expedition against the Chouf on 18 June 1524, during which thirty villages were burned and the beylerbey returned the next day with three camel loads of Druze heads and 300 Druze women and children captives. The campaigns were lauded by the contemporary ulema and poets of Damascus. There are no further mentions of Druze rebellions or government expeditions in the sources until the late 16th century. Tensions between the Druze and the Porte rose considerably as the Druze, along with other tribal and sectarian groups in Syria, acquired firearms which were at times superior to the firearms used by the Ottoman armies. The possession of firearms by non-military subjects was forbidden, though the authorities faced difficulties enforcing the ban in Syria. The Syrians obtained at least part of their arsenals from European powers intent on destabilizing Ottoman rule in Syria. The arsenals were provided using mercantile ships which docked in the Syrian ports. Other sources included the Janissaries of Damascus, the timar (fief)-holders in Syria and Ottoman ships from Constantinople which came to transport grain from Syria to the imperial capital. Druze armed with long muskets attacked officials sent to collect the taxes from their subdistricts and repulsed the subsequent Ottoman raid against them at Ain Dara in 1565. In an order by the Porte to the beylerbey of Damascus in August 1574, it is mentioned that the villagers of the Gharb, Jurd, Chouf and Matn owed tax arrears dating over twenty years and that the muqaddams (chieftains) of the Druze possessed large quantities of muskets; the muqaddams named in the order were the Ma'nid Qurqumaz, possibly the grandson of the above mentioned Qurqumaz, the Tanukhid Sharaf al-Din and the non-Druze chieftains Mansur ibn Hasan of the Keserwan- based Assaf family and Qasim of the Wadi al-Taym-based Shihab family. The beylerbey was ordered to collect at least 6,000 muskets from the named chieftains and more from each household of the named subdistricts. The combined forces of the beylerbey of Damascus, the imperial Damascene Janissaries, the sanjak-bey of Tripoli, and an Ottoman fleet launched an expedition against the Druze that year, but they were unable to subdue and disarm them. The imperial order from 1574 was renewed in February 1576, but the beylerbey of Damascus was again unable to execute the order rather complaining that the inhabitants of the Gharb, Jurd, Chouf and Matn remained in a state of rebellion, that no multazim was willing to accept the tax farm for the subdistricts and appointed emins (tax collectors) were disrespected by the populace. The Porte consequently ordered that the beylerbey destroy an unspecified number of Druze villages, arrest and punish their muqaddams and collect the tax arrears. No military action was taken and the Druze continued to defy the authorities and were reported by the government to have acquired further muskets in 1582. In that year they were accused of collaborating with the Druze and Shia Muslims of the Safad Sanjak, south of Sidon-Beirut, and the Porte's order called for \\"get[ting] rid of [Qurqumaz] ibn Ma'n, whose trouble and evil deeds exceed all others\\". Prelude Al-Qaramani wrote that the vizier Ibrahim Pasha was sent to Egypt and Syria in 1583 to \\"rectify the situation [there]\\". On 12 February 1585 an imperial order issued to the beylerbey of Damascus, Uveys Pasha, reaffirmed that Qurqumaz was \\"a rebellious chieftain ... who has gathered [around him] miscreants in the Druze community and done harm and mischief in the sanjak of Safad\\". Ibrahim Pasha arrived in Damascus with a tribute caravan from Egypt and a large military escort in June. He was instructed by the Porte to subdue the Druze of Mount Lebanon. On 31 August Uveys Pasha was ordered by the Porte to cooperate with Ibrahim Pasha against the Bedouin and the Druze who had rebelled throughout Damascus Eyalet, causing damage and attacking highways. Abu-Husayn views the constant state of rebellion by the Druze and the general insubordination of chieftains in parts of Syria where the government had been unable to exercise authority as the direct cause of Ibrahim Pasha's expedition. Expedition and follow up campaigns Ibrahim Pasha's army consisted of the Janissaries of Egypt and Damascus, and his troops numbered about 20,000. The versions of Duwayhi and Shihabi, which add the troops of Aleppo Eyalet and Cyprus Eyalet to the expeditionary force, hold that Ibrahim Pasha's troops encamped in an area called Marj Armush and the size of the Ottoman force alone \\"frightened all the Arab lands\\". The Ottoman troops and their local backers blocked the roads to the coast and the Beqaa Valley and killed about 500 Druze elders. Government records confirm Ibrahim Pasha killed hundreds of Druze rebels, sent many of their heads to Constantinople and had \\"thus punished the rebellious community properly\\". Numerous villages in the Chouf were plundered and Qurqumaz went into hiding in a cave and died. The Druze and others were disarmed and tax arrears were collected, with al-Burini reporting that Ibrahim Pasha confiscated thousands of muskets and large sums of money from the Druze. Ibrahim Pasha used Mansur ibn Furaykh as his guide. Ibn Furaykh was a Sunni Bedouin chieftain of the Beqaa Valley and local enemy of Qurqumaz who had a reputation of hostility toward the Druze and Shias; the role attributed to Ibn Furaykh of persuading the vizier to launch the campaign by the 19th-century chroniclers was without foundation, according to Abu-Husayn. During the expedition, a number of Ma'nids and other Druze chieftains, including the Alam al-Dins of the Matn and the Sharaf al-Dins of the Gharb defected to Ibrahim Pasha, along with a significant proportion of Qurqumaz's men. Ibrahim Pasha arrived in Constantinople later in 1585. According to Minadoi's account he entered the Golden Horn with 24 galleys and received a welcome by a volley of artillery fire from the Topkapi Palace and large crowds. In contradiction to Duwayhi's account of the tribute having been robbed, contemporary accounts indicate it arrived in Constantinople with about 300,000‚Äì1,000,000 piasters, 173,000 gold pieces, an emerald throne for Sultan Murad III (), Arabian horses, an elephant and a giraffe. After the expedition, in the same year, the Sidon-Beirut Sanjak was detached from Damascus Eyalet and became part of Tripoli Eyalet, which was established in 1579. The beylerbey of Tripoli from 1579, the local chieftain of the Akkar area Yusuf Sayfa Pasha, was concomitantly dismissed, likely because of suspicions that he would compromise the government's interests for local considerations. His replacement, the veteran Ottoman commander Ja'far Pasha al-Tuwashi, was entrusted with continuing Ibrahim Pasha's suppression of the rebellion in Mount Lebanon. Yusuf Sayfa may have resisted his dismissal, as according to Duwayhi his territory in Akkar was raided by Ja'far Pasha. The latter was reassigned to the Safavid front within a few months and without his iron grip the territory of Sidon-Beirut drifted out of Tripoli's control and, in practice, reverted to Damascene oversight. Although Duwayhi's version holds that a number of Syrian chieftains were captured in Ibrahim Pasha's expedition and brought to Constantinople, contemporary sources indicate most of the chieftains were captured in a follow-up campaign by Ali Pasha ibn Alwan, Ibrahim Pasha's appointee as beylerbey of Damascus, in 1586. Among the captive chieftains were Muhammad, the Ghazir-based son and successor of the Assaf chieftain Mansur, Muhammad ibn Jamal al-Din and Mundhir, the respective Tanukhid chiefs of Aramoun and Abeih, Ali al-Harfush, the Shia chieftain of Baalbek, and Ibn Furaykh. The chieftains were well-received in Constantinople and shortly after sent back to their respective territories with confirmations of their iltizam. Aftermath Map of 17th-century Ottoman Syria, showing the eyalets of Damascus, Tripoli, Aleppo and Rakka. The 1585‚Äì1586 events marked a turning point in the history of Mount Lebanon and the Levant in general under Ottoman rule. The Ottomans began to entrust local chieftains with the policing and taxation of the region by appointing them over the sanjaks of the region and granting them the title of bey (Turkish equivalent to the Arabic emir). Qurqumaz's son Fakhr al-Din II was appointed sanjak-bey of Sidon-Beirut in the early 1590s and was additionally assigned Safad Sanjak in 1602. Fakhr al-Din combined lucrative commercial ties with the Italians, a privately-funded army of sekbans (musketeers), and support from Ottoman officialdom, which he guaranteed through bribes and prompt payment of taxes, to establish himself as the most powerful chieftain of the Levant until his downfall in 1633. Ali al- Harfush, who had been appointed sanjak-bey of Homs in 1585, was kept in his post during his exile in Constantinople and returned to his Baalbek headquarters by 1589. He was executed but his son Musa succeeded him in Baalbek and was appointed sanjak-bey of Homs in 1592. The historian Stefan Winter places the 1585 expedition within the context of imperial changes to the military and fiscal structures of the Levant in the late 16th century, which included the creation of the hybrid eyalet of Tripoli in 1579, which combined the military appendage sanjak of Jabala with the tax revenue-driven sanjaks of Sidon-Beirut, Homs and Salamiyah, which were governed by local chieftains and did not contribute troops for war. About the same time the Porte also began to grant lands along the upper Euphrates valley to Ottoman officers and loyal Bedouin chieftains and in 1586 created the Rakka Eyalet all toward exerting greater control of the desert interior of the Levant.

He is best known for his luxury line of handbags and collections of interior products. In addition to his work in design, Herman, from 2011-2012 was signed to a first look deal to develop television and feature film concepts with Shaftesbury Films, and later from 2013-15 with Starz Media  Film Roman. In 2016, Herman signed another first look deal with Lakeshore Films, and partnered up with Drew Barrymore of Flower Films and Universal Cable Productions (UCP) to co-develop BLOOMS, a one-hour dramedy series for MTV Productions. Herman is currently represented by the talent agency William Morris Endeavor. Early life Born June 19, 1972, Herman was raised by his mother Judy Herman in Los Angeles, California. He is of Hungarian descent and identifies himself both as American and Hungarian. His mother, Judy, operated a small personal agency in Beverly Hills. Her clients included Frank Sinatra, Elizabeth Taylor, Ellen Degeneres, Dr. Dre, D.J. Steve Aoki, Steve Jobs, Jennifer Aniston, and many others. For over twenty years, Judy was entrusted in taking care of their personal lives and homes. Unfortunately, Greg's sister, Lori, was diagnosed with stage four Hodgkins lymphoma and thyroid cancer. Lori survived, and in a chance meeting with Erin Brokovich later came to spearhead a lawsuit against the city of Beverly Hills and Venoco. This case and Lori's struggles gained international media attention and was chronicled in Julia Stoops's book Parts per Million. Herman, after graduating from Beverly Hills High School, went on to study theatre and modern drama at University of Cambridge and later earned a degree in Anthropology from The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Career Upon graduating college, Herman was crashing on friends' sofas, when he started Greg Herman Handbags in 1997. Having traded medical school for the fashion industry, Herman was determined to alter the way handbags were designed and sold. His first launch collection was a modernistic look incorporating suede and tapestry fabric. He left Los Angeles and headed to New York to pursue a career in fashion, specifically handbag design. The brand formally debuted that same year with the aid of then friend and muse Rachel Rosenzweig aka Rachel Zoe, the Steven Alan Showroom, and Jane Pratt, founder of Jane Magazine, all of who helped shepherd the collections throughout the New York fashion scene -- introducing Herman to both buyers and editors at W Magazine, Cosmopolitan, and Vogue. Herman went on to become a global brand creating exclusive handbag collections for Barneys New York, House of Fraser, Scoop, Henri Bendel, Harvey Nichols, and Neiman Marcus. In 2000, Herman developed one of the first online handbag collections with Girlshop.com, the first dedicated online fashion portal. In 1998, Herman befriended Brittany Murphy, Alyssa Milano, Christina Applegate, and Sharon Stone. In 2017, Greg met artist and photographer Orit Harpaz and together they created the Weirdoh Birds brand- a collection made up of chic and groovy wallcoverings, homegoods, and other wares . Today, the Greg Herman brand, House of Herman, and Bands of Misfits are operated by MGC collective, a collaborative design group focused on curating collections and setting up strategic creative partnerships in the fields of accessories, home design products, hospitality, jewelry, apparel, and fine art. Personal life Herman resides and maintains his base of operations both in Los Angeles and New York.

In 1564, when it was part of the Kingdom of Candia, the Venetians built a fortress on Spinalonga, which soon became a key outpost for controlling the trading routes to the Levant. After Crete fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1649, Spinalonga remained under Venetian control until 1718. Shortly after the departure of the last Ottomans in 1898, the Cretan State established a leper colony on the island in 1904 that operated until 1957. This decision was influenced both by political factors and Edvard Ehlers' theories, who was strongly in favor of secluding leprosy patients in order to contain the disease. The Spinalonga blues, Archaeology.wiki, 20/11/2017 Spinalonga initially received patients from Crete but after 1913, when Crete was annexed to the Kingdom of Greece, also from mainland Greece.

At that time, Spinalonga had been abandoned for ten years but little was known about the life of patients on the island; neither the state nor the locals wished to share details about the colony. Born was intrigued by the islands' past and returned in 1968, supported by a grant from the Paris Institute of the Environment (). Based at the nearby fishing village of Plaka, he meticulously surveyed the settlement, the bastions and the fortifications on the island. At the same time, he gained the confidence of residents of Plaka and nearby villages who had been in regular contact with Spinalonga inmates and collected their accounts on life on the island. Born then turned his attention to former Spinalonga residents who had been transferred to the Hospital of Infectious Diseases in Agia Varvara, Attica and recorded their stories. It was there where he met and befriended with Epaminondas Remoundakis (el), the most emblematic inmate of Spinalonga, whom he interviewed for long periods of time. Funded by Sandoz Laboratories, Born and director Jean-Daniel Pollet produced in 1973 the documentary L'Ordre that focuses on Spinalonga and includes a unique interview with Remoundakis. In 2015, he published a book titled Vies et morts d‚Äôun Cr√©tois l√©preux (Lifes and deaths of a Cretan leper) that is based on Remoundakis' narrations. Later life During the 1980s in Saint-Imier, Born founded Espace noir, an anarchist cultural cooperative, and the Canevas editions.Dictionnaire du Jura ‚Äì Born, Maurice, 25/04/2013 Born also developed an interest in contemporary history of Crete.

Biography=Early life and education Aisultan was born in 1990 in then Kazakh SSR. His father Rakhat Aliyev (1962‚Äì2015) was a businessman, politician, and diplomat. His mother Dariga Nazarbayeva (born 1963) is the eldest daughter of Nursultan Nazarbayev. He studied at the International College of Continuing Education in Astana and the American International School in Salzburg. In 2010, Aisultan graduated from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and then from KIMEP University with a degree in business administration. Football career Aisultan started playing football at the FC Admira Wacker M√∂dling during his father's service as ambassador to Austria. In 2006, he played two matches in the first league of Kazakhstan for the FC Rahat, in 2007 he was a member of FC Kairat and took part in the qualifying tournament for the 2006 European Youth Football Championship. Aisultan spent two or three months at the Chelsea F.C. He played a season until 2007 in the youth team of Portsmouth F.C., and became the bronze medalist of the English Championship. In 2011, Aisultan played for FC Astana. On 21 October 2012, he played the only match in the championship of Kazakhstan in the home game for the FC Sunkar against FC Aktobe and came out in the middle of the second half. From February to October 2017, Aisultan served as vice president of the Football Federation of Kazakhstan for relations with international organizations FIFA, UEFA, and national associations. He was awarded the British Valor Award for his participation in operations equivalent to combat. Illegal activities Aisultan was treated in a clinic for drug addicts because of his addiction to cocaine. In October 2019, he was sentenced to a suspended sentence for an attack on a police officer in London in June 2019 and damage to a stranger's property. The verdict included probation, continued drug addiction treatment, community service and a fine. Personal life In August 2013, Aisultan was married to Alima Nazarbayeva. He had a daughter named Ameli (born 2016) and son named Sultan. On 23 January 2020, Aisultan made a public statement on his Facebook page, claiming that his grandfather Nazarbayev was allegedly his dad and that his life was threatened. He also stated that from 8 July 2019, he had not been able to use any of his social media accounts, because he was kept in custody and that the accounts were under control by his mother Dariga Nazarbayeva and the ex-chairman of the NSC Alnur Mussayev. In response to those claims, Mussayev on his Facebook page published a document from 2013 that showed the DNA of Aisultan and his father Rakhat Aliyev coinciding to within 99.999784244% accuracy. However, the record itself was not certified by any seal or signature. Moreover, later right after the death of Aisultan, Mussayev in his interview to ¬´Exclusive Kazakhstan¬ª admitted that he had published a fake DNA test results and that Aliyev is indeed not his biological father, however not specifying exactly who the father is. On 13 February 2020, Aisultan requested political asylum in the United Kingdom. He explained this decision due to pressure by his family, since he had information \\"about high-scale corruption between the government of Russia and Kazakhstan\\". Minister of Information and Social Development Dauren Abaev reported Khabar Agency that \\"to speculate on the fantasies of an addict just because he is the grandson of the First President, it‚Äôs not fair. It‚Äôs unfair and beyond morality. It is time to close this topic.\\" Death On 16 August 2020, it was reported that Aisultan had died presumably due to cardiac arrest in London, just ten days before his 30th birthday. The exact cause of death is being investigated. His mother, Nazarbayeva, stated \\"My family is devastated at the loss of our beloved Aisultan and we ask for privacy at this very difficult time.\\" References Category:1990 births Category:2020 deaths Category:FC Kairat players Category:Kazakhstani footballers Category:Kazakhstani football biography stubs Category:FC Admira Wacker M√∂dling players Category:Chelsea F.C. players Category:Portsmouth F.C. players Category:FC Astana players Category:FC Sunkar players Category:Royal Military Academy Sandhurst Category:Nursultan Nazarbayev family ","title":"Aisultan Nazarbayev"},{"id":"64972786","title":"Kansas's 24th Senate district"},{"id":"64972789","text":"The United States applies sanctions against China.

He was one of the leaders of the military coup on October 15, 1979, and the chairman of the Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador from 1979 to 1980.  Biography  Adolfo Arnoldo Majano Ramos was born on 21 April 1938 in the Moraz√°n Department El Salvador. He entered the Salvadoran Escuela Militar Capit√°n General Gerardo Barrios in 1955 and graduated in 1958 with the rank of junior lieutenant of the infantry. In 1974, he graduated from the General Staff of the Higher Military School in Mexico City. He also studied at the School of the Americas in the Panama Canal Zone, then served in the Salvadoran Army. After serving in the 1st Infantry Brigade, he was promoted to the rank of colonel. In 1979, Colonel Majano was involved in a military conspiracy to overthrow the regime of Carlos Humberto Romero. After the coup on October 15, 1979, Majano became one of two army representatives in the Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador. Majano was considered the most important person in the junta. Adolfo Arnoldo Majano (front left) and Jaime Abdul Guti√©rrez (front right). On 13 December 1980 at a meeting of the command of the Salvadoran Army, Christian Democrat Jose Napoleon Duarte became President of the junta with Colonel Jaime Abdul Gutierrez as Vice President. Colonel Majano appointed to be the military attach√© to Spain, however, he refused this appointment and accused the junta of supporting right-wing extremists. Colonel Majano resigned as Commander-in- Chief and Chairman of the Revolutionary Government Junta in May 1980 and was replaced with Jaime Abdul Guti√©rrez. He resigned from the junta on 13 December 1980. On the evening of 15 December, he convened a press conference at which he accused the junta of terrorism and the Christian Democratic Party of conciliation. The junta issued an order for the arrest of Majano, which immediately provoked a protest from the leaders of the Military Youth. The press often reported Majano's intention to join the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front following his arrest warrant being issued. On 20 February 1981, Majano was arrested. He was arrested and imprisoned along side Roberto D'Aubuisson. He was released on 20 March 1981 and went into exile in Panama. When Panamanian President Omar Torrijos died in 1981, he moved to Mexico, and later to Canada in 1983. He returned to El Salvador in 1988 and survived an assassination attempt. Majano currently lives in El Salvador, is married, and has four children.

Life and career  S√© station. Ceschiatti was born in Belo Horizonte in 1918, from Italian parents. He went to Italy in 1937, benefited by the Italian government in promoting trips by the children of immigrants to the country. Back to Brazil, he settled in Rio de Janeiro where he studied at the National School of Fine Arts. He was awarded at the National Salon of Fine Arts, in 1945, for the bas-relief of the baptistery of the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi, in Belo Horizonte. He met Oscar Niemeyer, who commissioned him a sculpture for the Architectural Ensemble of Pampulha, in Belo Horizonte. Ceschiatti created O Abra√ßo, a sculpture depicting two embraced women. The citizens of Belo Horizonte considered immoral, it was kept for many years until it was finally exposed in a garden in Pampulha. The sculpture Duas Amigas was made for the Sal√£o Nobre (upper garden) of the Itamaraty Palace with guidance from Ambassador Wladimir Murtinho, who served as chief curator in the Palace's ambience project. The artist's taste for the female figure is present in several of his works. In 1960 he sculpted, in granite, As tr√™s for√ßas armadas, one of the themes in the Monument to the Dead of World War II, in Rio de Janeiro. His works are in exhibition in several Brazilian museums. In a new partnership with Niemeyer, he became the main sculptor of the country's new capital Bras√≠lia, including: * As Iaras, in bronze, at the Pal√°cio da Alvorada's reflecting pool; * Leda e o Cisne, bronze, at Pal√°cio do Jaburu's courtyard; * A Justi√ßa, in granite, in front of the Supreme Federal Court building; * Os Anjos and Os Evangelistas,in the Metropolitan Cathedral of Bras√≠lia; * As g√™meas, in bronze, at the Itamaraty Palace; * Anjo, in golden bronze at the Chamber of Deputies; * A Contorcionista, in the Sala Villa Lobos foyer, Cl√°udio Santoro National Theater * Deusa Athena, at the University of Bras√≠lia's Central Library; He was part of the National Commission of Fine Arts and professor of sculpture and drawing at the University of Bras√≠lia. He then resigned in solidarity with colleagues persecuted for political reasons. He complained, decades later, about the way Bras√≠lia treated his works.

They can be used for ascertaining which statistic should appear in the denominator in an F-test for testing a null hypothesis that a particular effect is absent.  Definition  When the total corrected sum of squares in an ANOVA is partitioned into several components, each attributed to the effect of a particular predictor variable, each of the sums of squares in that partition is a random variable that has an expected value. That expected value divided by the corresponding number of degrees of freedom is the expected mean square for that predictor variable.  Example  The following example is from Longitudinal Data Analysis by Donald Hedeker and Robert D. Gibbons. Donald Hedeker, Robert D. Gibbons. Longitudinal Data Analysis. Wiley Interscience. 2006. pp. 21‚Äì24 Each of s treatments (one of which may be a placebo) is administered to a sample of (capital) N randomly chosen patients, on whom certain measurements Y_{hij} are observed at each of (lower-case) n specified times, for h=1,\\\\ldots,s, \\\\quad i=1,\\\\ldots,N_h (thus the numbers of patients receiving different treatments may differ), and j=1,\\\\ldots, n.

Follower of Francisco Pi y Margall, he briefly served as Minister of Development during the First Spanish Republic.  Biography = Early life  Born in C√°diz on 26 November 1822, his father had Italian origin. He was a feeble child during infancy. He took studies at the Colegio de San Pedro and later the Colegio de San Felipe Neri. Already writing as teenager for the newspaper El Defensor del Pueblo, he later wrote for La Alborada, as well he authored 3 theatre pieces. Working since 1840 for the municipal beneficence office, he was hired as teacher at San Felipe Neri in 1848 (soon starting to publish grammar books), and as lecturer on Geodesy and Astronomy at the Naval Observatory in San Fernando (1857).  Sexenio Democr√°tico  After the 1868 Glorious Revolution, Benot became a member of the Constituent Cortes formed upon the 1869 election in representation of the district of Jerez de la Frontera (C√°diz), overcoming Juan Prim at the election, although Prim was elected anyways as he was candidate in another district. He was one of the supporters of a manifesto promoted by Francisco Pi y Margall on 10 May 1870 which reaffirmed on \\"pactist\\" federalism, in response to the so-called \\"Declaration of the Republican Press\\" (published on 7 May 1870), which attempted to resignify federalism as a simple administrative decentralization. He was later elected Senator in representation of the province of Girona in the 1872‚Äì1873 period. Following the proclamation of the First Spanish Republic in February 1873, he earned again a seat at the Congress of Deputies in representation of the district of Algeciras (C√°diz) at the May 1873 election. He was appointed as Minister of Development of the executive power presided by Pi y Margall in June 1873. His short ministerial tenure, barely 17 days, delivered the creation of the (predecessor to both the National Geographical Institute and the National Statistics Institute), and the draft of the Ley de 24 de julio 1873, sobre el trabajo en los talleres y la instrucci√≥n en las escuelas de los ni√±os obreros (published after his exit from government), the so-called \\"Benot Law\\" regulating child labour, entailing the first State intervention in labour relations ever in Spain. The law failed to be effectively enforced, however. He also forced ayuntamientos to pay for teachers' wage arrears. He was replaced by at the ministerial portfolio. He exiled after the 1874 coup of Pav√≠a to Portugal, where he began to edit the bi-weekly La Europa, only to return to Madrid some time later, as C√°novas del Castillo achieved, via a requirement for expulsion to the Portuguese authorities, the forced return to Spain of Benot.  Later life  Caricature of Benot by Moya (Madrid C√≥mico) Already a correspondent member of the Royal Spanish Academy since 1860, he was later elected as numerary member, taking possession of the Chair Z on 14 April 1889, reading ¬øQu√© es hablar? a speech replied by V√≠ctor Balaguer. His contributions to Spanish grammar have received diverse and lavish praises, but they tend to agree in pointing out the \\"modernity\\" of his approaches, sometimes even considered to be a \\"direct precursor\\" of \\"modern linguistics\\". Benot would return to the Lower House, elected in representation of Madrid at the 1893 election. He replaced Pi y Margall at the helm of the Federal Democratic Republican Party when the latter died. He could not however avoid the fracture of the party in May 1905. Catalanist republicans would reject from then on the insertion within the main stem of the Spanish left-wing. Burial procession of Benot in Madrid Ill and progressively blind since 1901, he died poor at Calle del Marqu√©s de Villamagna 6, Madrid, on 27 July 1907. The funeral procession that took place on the next day was attended by , , Azc√°rate, Salmer√≥n and Labra and by an attendance formed chiefly by republican sympathizers. Benot was buried at the in the Necr√≥polis del Este, in the same tomb Pi y Margall had been initially buried prior to the transfer of its corpse to a specific mausoleum funded via popular subscription.

It was the first crocodyliform discovered in the entire Shishugou Formation. The crocodyliform specimen has not been studied yet and the exact genus it pertains to remains unknown, although it may have been similar to or synonymous with the contemporaneous Junggarsuchus or Nominosuchus.  History  Block containing the Limusaurus holotype (green), gastroliths (red), an assigned specimen of Limusaurus (blue), and the upper Shishigou crocodyliform (purple) It is known from a single fully articulated skeleton, found on the same slab that also preserved the holotype of the noasaurid Limusaurus inextricabilis and an associated specimen of L. inextricabilis, which were found in 2001 by a Chinese-American team of paleontologists examining the Wucaiwan locality in the Shishugou Formation, in the northeastern Junggar Basin of Xinjiang, China, discovered three bone beds (numbered TBB 2001; found by T. Yu and J. Mo). The bone beds were dominated by the remains of small theropod dinosaurs, representing at least three genera, with most belonging to a small ceratosaur, with Limusaurus being the first member of this group found in Asia. Stacked skeletons from these bone beds were removed from the field in blocks jacketed by plaster and encased in crates. A resin cast of block TBB 2001 was made (including the crocodyliform specimen), making it available for study after the specimens had been extracted from the original matrix. The crocodyliform specimen from this block and the associated Limusaurus specimens are mounted in a cast of the block in its semi-prepared state. When Limusaurus was described in 2009 by paleontologist Xu Xing and colleagues, the crocodlyliform specimen was briefly mentioned during a short footnote - no genus name was given. It has not been described since.  Paleoenvironment  Restoration of two Guanlong and a Yinlong, contemporaries of the unnamed crocodyliform in the Shishugou Formation The specimen was recovered from the Shishugou Formation, a succession of sedimentary rocks that was deposited at the northeastern margin of the Junggar foreland basin and is about in thickness. The formation is dated to the Late Jurassic, around 161 to 157 million years ago. The unnamed crocodyliform occurs in the upper part of the formation, which represents a variety of environments, including alluvial fans and alluvial plains, streams, wetlands, and shallow lakes. During the time when The unnamed crocodyliform lived, the environment would have been consistently warm and dry, judging by the abundance of coal and carbon-rich deposits. The climate was probably highly seasonal due to monsoonal influences, with warm, wet summers and dry winters. The climate enabled the growth of a richly forested environment; the forest would have been dominated by Araucaria trees, with the undergrowth being occupied by Coniopteris tree ferns, Anglopteris and Osmunda ferns, Equisetites horsetails, and Elatocladus shrubs. The environment of the Shishugou Formation hosted a diverse assemblage of animals. More than 35 species of vertebrates are known from fossils, including at least 14 dinosaur species.. Contemporaries of The unnamed crocodyliform in the Wucaiwan locality include the theropods Limusaurus, Haplocheirus, Zuolong, and Guanlong, the latter of which is, like Limusaurus, frequently found in mud deposits; the sauropod Mamenchisaurus; the ornithischians Gongbusaurus and Yinlong; the cynodont Yuanotherium; the mammal Acuodulodon; the crocodyliforms Sunosuchus, Junggarsuchus, Nominosuchus; and the turtles Xinjiangchelys and Annemys.

He was governor of Kasa√Ø Province in the Belgian Congo from 1948 to 1952. Life Firmin J. A. Peigneux was born in 1904 in the village of Moha, Li√®ge. His parents were Arthur Joseph Peigneux (1876‚Äì1942) and Flore Lega (1879‚Äì1952). He joined the colonial service and arrived in the Belgian Congo in 1925 at the age of 21. Peigneux spent his entire colonial career in the southwest of the Belgian Congo, in Bas-Congo, L√©opoldville and Kasa√Ø. In 1926 his supervisor said in an evaluation report, \\"This officer has the qualities needed to become an elite administrator in the short term.\\" He was sensible, tactful and thoughtful in his dealings with the natives, and that had earned him the confidence of leaders and elders. Pierre Ryckmans travelled through Bas-Congo District in 1930‚Äì1931 investigating labor conditions. He reached the territory of Thysville on 6 November 1930, where Peigneux was the administrator 1st class. He found that censuses had badly under-counted dependent women and children, and excessive numbers of Africans were being employed by the European companies and on the railway. The north of the territory, near the river, held the center of Kimbanguism. Peigneux showed Ryckmans examples of Kimbanguist chants, psalm-like hymns that proclaimed the glory of the pure and the confusion of the unfaithful, Black and White, when Jesus would return. They interpreted the Old Testament curses against evil kings as allusions to missionaries and administrators. Peigneux became commissioner of Kwango District, with capital at Kikwit. He became Governor of Kasa√Ø Province on 19 July 1948, replacing L√©on A. Hofkens. He held office until 11 April 1952, and was replaced by Roger Le Bussy. Peigneux had been recalled to Belgium for health reasons. He was one of the few provincial governors who were openly socialist in their views. Peigneux was admitted to the Order of L√©opold on 15 November 1946. He was promoted to the rank of officer on 19 October 1949. Peigneux's signature as a director, and that of governor Hector Martin, appears on notes of the Central Bank of Belgian Congo and Rwanda-Burundi (Banque Centrale du Congo Belge et du Ruanda-Urundi) between 1956 and 1958. In 1957 he was elected a member of the International Institute of Differing Civilizations. He was a member of a commission of inquiry sent to Rwanda in January 1960 to report on the violence there in November 1959. He died in 1968 in Huy, Li√®ge at the age of 64.

While many of the local churches had cemeteries, the town of Hershey had no community cemetery until Hershey Cemetery was established in 1918. Given that Hershey, Pennsylvania had a young population at the time of its establishment there was originally no need for a cemetery. However, by 1916, Milton Hershey saw the need for Hershey to establish a cemetery as his wife Catherine Sweeney Hershey died in 1915. Catherine Sweeney's body was held at Laurel Hill Cemetery until Hershey Cemetery was established. Milton Hershey donated land that was on Laudermich Road, one mile north of Hershey, Pennsylvania, that overlooked the Swatara Creek basin to be used as the site of the Hershey Cemetery. The cemetery's design and landscaping was based upon the community cemetery's planned design from 1915. Shrubbery and bushes were placed throughout the cemetery. On July 31, 1923, Hershey transferred the land into a cemetery for $1.00. Milton Hershey built a marble monument reading \\"Hershey,\\" which marks the spot of the Hershey family's grave plots.

It is situated in the Cascade Range, northwest of Spirit Lake, and east of Coldwater Lake. Its nearest higher neighbor is Mount Margaret, to the northeast, and Mount St. Helens rises to the south. Precipitation runoff from Coldwater Peak drains into Coldwater Creek, a tributary of the North Fork Toutle River. The mountain takes its name from this creek, and was officially adopted in 1983 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. A trail provides access to the summit, the site of the former Coldwater Lookout from 1935 to 1968, and now is a site for research instruments. Geology Ash-covered Coldwater Peak and St. Helens Lake on June 19, 1980, one month after eruption The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity occurred. The lateral blast from the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens was pointed straight toward Coldwater Peak and stripped the vegetation from the slopes. Due to Mount Saint Helens' proximity to Coldwater Peak, volcanic ash is common in the area.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Climate Coldwater Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008.Spirit Lake, Mount St. Helens, St. Helens Lake, and Coldwater Peak Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak.

Three years later he transferred to Mesivta Torah V'Daas. Despite his yeshiva rabbincal student status, he was drafted into the army August 1944. While on leave during his training period he spent time in a Jewish book store frequented by his future father-in-law. He was discharged early 1946. He married Sarah Gartenhouse on June 18, 1947. Thru 1954 he studied at Bais Medrash Elyon, in Monsey, at which time, with the help of a cousin already at Yeshiva Ner Yisroel, he accepted a teaching position. Dean, Ner Yisroel He also was involved with the testing process for rabbinical ordination at Ner Yisroel. When the school was able to accept students permitted to leave Iran, he \\"became almost like a surrogate parent to them.\\" Kulefsky served as the Rosh Yeshiva from Rabbi Weinberg's death in 1999 until his own death on November 30, 2000. Yissocher Frand compared how his personality was able to \\"transmit to literally thousands of talmidim\\" because his method was like giving \\"a baby its first lollypop\\" leading to many a life- long connection. An example of his being gentle was when a student asked for permission to skip part of a day in yeshiva to attend an out-of-town wedding. When Kulefsky delayed a direct yes or no, the student asked \\"so is it OK\\" and was told \\"I can't tell you whether its OK for you to go. I have enough problems worrying about my bittul Torah;;Americanism: wasting time I can't speak for yours.\\" Some of his teachings were encapsulated in \\"Chidushei Rav Kulefsky.\\" Personal Kulefsky was a first born only son; he had 3 sisters. He was survived by his wife of 53 years and their \\"two sons, three daughters, 40 grandchildren and 12 greatgrandchildren, and buried in Baltimore County's Agudath Israel Congregation Cemetery a day after he \\"delivered his last class November 29th.

She is a chevalier of the Ordre National du M√©rite.  Early life  Wyart was born into a family of scientists. Her mother, Fran√ßoise Brochard-Wyart, is a prominent French physicist, and a professor at the Curie Institute. Her father, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, was a Nobel-prize winning physicist. As their father was mostly absent, Wyart and her siblings were raised by their mother, though Claire thought of him as \\"the pillar who held our family together\\".  Education  Wyart studied at the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris. She then undertook a PhD in biophysics at the Universit√© Louis Pasteur (now University of Strasbourg), which she completed in 2003. Working in the lab of Didier Chatenay, she studied small networks of controlled architecture.  Research and career  Wyart did five years of postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley between 2005 and 2010. She worked for a year in Noam Sobel's lab, investigating the effects of smelling compounds in body secretions. She then worked in Udi Isacoff, using optogenetics ‚Äî the modulation of neuronal activity using light ‚Äî to study the control of behaviour in zebrafish larvae. In 2011, she started her own lab at the Institut du cerveau et de la moelle √©pini√®re (ICM, Brain and Spine Institute) in Paris. Wyart has received international funding for her research, from bodies such as the European Research Council, the Human Frontier Science Program and the National Institutes of Health. Her team investigates how neuromodulatory pathways of the Central Nervous System (the brain and spinal cord) affect locomotion and posture. Her lab has three main areas of research: the effect of neuromodulation and peptide release on reticulospinal neurons, and on neurons in contact with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF); the links between CSF and body axis formation and scoliosis; and new strategies to treat spinal cord trauma. In an interview in 2015, she explained that her aim was to understand how to reactivate motor circuits in humans. Her lab's particular focus is ciliated neurons which contact the CSF; such neurons integrate both mechanical and chemical signals, and project onto spinal cord motor circuits. Along with brain circuits and reflexes, these neurons represent a third circuit governing locomotion. The morphology and markers expressed by these neurons, discovered in zebrafish, are conserved in other animals including mice and macaques. Wyart's team has also demonstrated that these neurons can detect the curvature of the spinal cord. In collaboration with her former PhD student Olivier Mirat, Wyart launched ZebraZoom, a software to analyse zebrafish larvae behaviour. She serves on the advisory board of Current Biology, on the board of directors of the FENS-Kavli Network of Excellence, and on the scientific council of the Fondation pour la Recherche Medicale (FRM). During the COVID-19 pandemic, she collaborated with Marie-Claude Potier to develop a screening test for the virus using sputum and saliva samples.  Science communication and outreach  While studying for her PhD, Wyart ran a science workshop for children twice a month at the Exploradome museum. After completing her PhD, she spent a year working for the Terma project in Nepal and India, teaching science in Tibetan schools by using practical experiments. This work was rewarded with a \\"D√©fi Jeunes\\" award. With her team at the ICM, she uses zebrafish larva to teach primary and middle school children the basics of development. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Wyart and her colleague Virginie Courtier-Orgozozo launched a website showcasing advice from experts and helpful tips for the public on how to stay safe. The website was subsequently translated into multiple languages. In an article by Michael Gross published in Current Biology, she is quoted as saying: \\"We deeply believe that it is the role of scientists to inform society and to provide the public with cues and methodology for them to be able to make better choices and to navigate safely in our new environment that we share with the SARS-CoV2 coronavirus.

It was owned by the Hawley Broadcasting Company alongside radio station WEEU (850 AM). The station ceased broadcasting because of the economic difficulties associated with early UHF television stations. History WEEU-TV began commercial broadcasting on April 15, 1953, as an extension of the radio station; the transmitter on Mount Penn had been radiating test patterns since April 9. Airing NBC and ABC programming, the station operated on a reduced-power basis for the first month and a half until it was ready to broadcast at its full authorized power. Prior to the passage of the All-Channel Receiver Act in 1964, receiving UHF television stations like WEEU-TV and competitor WHUM-TV (channel 61)‚Äîwhich signed on in February‚Äîtypically required a converter. Channel 33 worked with TV dealers and salesmen to go door-to-door to promote UHF conversions and the WEEU-TV program lineup. The local lineup included news, weather and sports programs, as well as Studio Date, a program for teenagers hosted by William Webber, later a children's television personality in Philadelphia. The station also produced other entertainment programs, including a cooking show and a quiz show titled \\"Know Your Reading\\". On June 28, 1955, Hawley Broadcasting announced that it would cease operation of WEEU- TV on June 30. In a full-page advertisement that ran in the Eagle and then in Broadcasting magazine, the next week, the company declared that it had closed the television station due to the \\"tremendous operating costs\\" involved and the \\"apathy\\" of national advertisers. (also republished in Broadcasting, July 4, 1955, p. 37) The move came as more viewers tuned to the more powerful‚Äîand VHF‚Äîsignals of Philadelphia's network stations. The channel 33 allocation was immediately considered to be shifted. In 1957, the FCC instituted a rulemaking proceeding to decide between two proposals by other UHF stations to move channel 33 to York or Harrisburg. At year's end, WEEU-TV surrendered the construction permit, which it still held. By that time, fellow UHF outlet WHUM-TV had closed as well. While the tower has been removed, the former transmitter building is still in use for a number of FM translators, as well as a translator for WFMZ-TV of Allentown. It was also used by WTVE when that station started in 1980; it left Reading and moved into Philadelphia proper in 2017.

He was UConn's unofficial photographer, taking thousands of photos documenting university history and life.  Life and career  Manter was born on December 30, 1889, in Londonderry, New Hampshire. His father was a farmer and operated a sawmill. The Manter family moved to Manchester when Manter was six years old. He graduated from Manchester High School and attended the New Hampshire College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (now the University of New Hampshire) from 1908 to 1912. Manter was offered a teaching and laboratory assistant position at the Connecticut Agricultural College by President Charles L. Beach, who hired him without an interview or even meeting him. He joined UConn in the fall of 1912. He taught zoology, with a focus on insects and birds, at the university until his retirement in 1953 after 41 years of service. Manter was a lifelong photographer who spent five decades documenting all aspects of university life and history as well as the town and residents of Storrs. Manter owned the first movie camera in town, taught using his own films, and videoed football games and other events. \\"Manter has made a contribution to this institution that cannot be matched. His photographic history alone is worth every penny we ever paid him,\\" President Albert N. Jorgensen told Provost Albert Waugh in 1947, according to Waugh's diary. Manter never accepted compensation for his photos. As of 2020, his huge photographic collection of 136,060 prints and negatives is held at the University of Connecticut Archives and Special Collections. Manter also took countless photographs of animals and birds, some of which illustrated his book Birds of Storrs, Connecticut and Vicinity (1965 and 1975 editions). Almost four hundred of his photos of early New England church architecture are featured in the book Meetinghouse and Church in Early New England (1963) by Manter's friend Edmund Ware Sinnott. His photographs also illustrate the book Homemaking for the Handicapped (1966) by Elizabeth Eckhardt May.  Personal life  Friend and fellow entomologist James A. Slater described Manter as \\"the epitome of the quiet, competent, unassuming New Englander.\\" Manter was active in the community, leading Boy Scout troops and wartime scrap paper drives. He was nicknamed \\"Jed\\" by his closest friends. He was known for his knack, developed over many years, of predicting bird migration patterns‚Äî\\"his accuracy was legend on campus,\\" reported the Hartford Courant. Manter married Florence Goodwin Manter (1890‚Äì1964) a few years after he commenced employment at UConn. The couple had three children: Audrey M., Jerauld T., and Stanley P. Following retirement, Manter remained an active photographer and continued to live on Gurleyville Road in Storrs. He died at Windham Hospital in Mansfield at the age of 100. He was interred in Storrs Cemetery, on a hill overlooking campus. Manter was survived by two of his children, Audrey and Jerauld. He was predeceased by his wife and a son, Stanley.  Legacy  In 2019, UConn renamed the Horsebarn Hill Road Extension to Manter Road in his honor. A species of fungus gnat is named after him: the Apemon manteri, which entomologist Charles Willison Johnson discovered in 1930 in Mansfield while collecting specimens with Manter along the Willimantic River.

Al finds his old business partner and lover, Brendan, who has built their company into the world‚Äôs largest tech company, and meets Sulla, the first humanoid robot, who was made with a copy of Al's mind but has chosen a female body.

New York City Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia called Rankin a \\"human index to New York City affairs,\\" and she gained a reputation as the City's unofficial historian. Her efforts secured the preservation of historic documents and promoted access to government information for municipal employees and citizens alike. Early life, education, and early career Rebecca Browning Rankin was born April 5, 1887, in Piqua, Ohio. She grew up in Illinois. Rankin attended the University of Michigan, graduating with her bachelor's degree in 1909. She received a full scholarship to attend Simmons University in Boston, where she earned her master in library science degree in 1913. While her undergraduate degree at the University of Michigan, Rankin worked in the cataloging department of the university's general library. Upon graduating with her masters degree in 1913, she received several job offers, deciding to take the opportunity to run the library for the State Normal School in Ellensburg, Washington. In her five years at the Washington State Normal School, she developed a library collection that emphasized the most current information for the training of teachers. Rankin started a bulletin sharing information with teachers across the state, as well as teaching courses on library methods. Career with NYPL and the Municipal Reference Library In 1918, Rankin moved to New York City to support her family, and took a position as assistant to New York Public Library (NYPL) director Edwin H. Anderson. Just a few months later, in January 1919, Rankin was named the assistant librarian at the Municipal Reference Library (MRL), a branch of the NYPL. She was appointed the Municipal Reference Library's director in 1920. In her role as director of the MRL, Rankin worked to promote the resources and services of the library. She and her staff prepared and delivered over 300 radio talks between 1928 and 1938, with weekly broadcasts over WNYC sharing civic information and promoting the library's services. These took the form of multiple WNYC series, including \\"Civics-in- Action\\" and \\"Highlights in Municipal Government\\". Rankin used these broadcasts as a way to advance her fervent beliefs in the ideas of reform and efficiency in government. In a March 1928 WNYC broadcast, she described the library's role to listeners, listing its functions as encouraging city officials to \\"intelligently adopt the best policies for the governing of the City,\\" providing resources to city employees and citizens, and answering questions about the city and its governance. She published her first book, Guide to the Municipal Government of the City of New York in 1936. New York Advancing: a Scientific Approach to Municipal Government, a book she published in 1936, became a surprise bestseller in the city, with subsequent editions being published in 1939 and 1946. She was a strong supporter of Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, who frequently contacted the library with questions. New York City's municipal records had been stored in haphazard conditions for decades, and Rankin worked to transfer particularly important collections to the Municipal Library. Rankin persuaded Mayor LaGuardia to establish the Mayor's Municipal Archives Committee, which she chaired for over ten years. Under the Committee's charge, the MRL became the chief institution for New York City's archival and records management functions. Mayor William O'Dwyer requested that Rankin develop a modern records management program; she developed a record retention manual and a training course for records managers. The City had purchased the 12-story Rhinelander Building in 1939 to house historical records, but only after Rankin's continued efforts was funding authorized for appropriate staff, shelving, and boxes. By moving inactive records to a centralized storage facility, the municipal departments of the city saved about $1,200,000 in rent from 1942 to 1952. In 1952, Mayor Vincent R. Impellitteri commended Rankin for her efforts in making the new Municipal Archives and Records Center (MARC) a reality. She retired on the day the new center opened, June 30, 1952. Service to librarianship Rankin served as the president of the Special Libraries Association from 1922 to 1923. In the 1930s, she served as the SLA Secretary, organizing the association's headquarters in New York City. In May 1959, she was inducted into the Special Libraries Association Hall of Fame. Her relationships with municipal employees played a key role in ensuring that NYC's public librarians were designated as eligible for the New York State Employee's pension and retirement system. Death and legacy Rankin died March 1, 1965 at the Dobbs Ferry Hospital in Dobbs Ferry, New York. A biography of the important role Rankin played as New York City's \\"unofficial historian\\" was published by Barry W. Seaver in 2004: A True Politician: Rebecca Browning Rankin, Municipal Reference Librarian of the City of New York, 1920‚Äì1952.

He was killed in office during a battle to route rebel tribesmen in the province. His brother-in-law, Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pasha, erected a tomb for him the mausoleum complex of Rumi in Konya. Life H√ºrrem was one of at least two sons of the veteran Ottoman statesman and commander Skender Pasha, the other being Mustafa Pasha. He was the brother-in-law of Sultan Suleiman's grand vizier Ibrahim Pasha, who was once a slave of Skender Pasha's family and married H√ºrrem's sister Mihrisa Hatun. H√ºrrem was appointed the beylerbey (governor-general) of Damascus Eyalet in 1523. He led a punitive expedition against the Druze of the Chouf subdistrict in Mount Lebanon led by the Ma'n family on 27 October 1523. The expedition ended with his burning of forty-three villages and the killing of at least four hundred Druze. He launched a second expedition in 1524 when his subashis (superintendents) were killed by the Druze. In the second campaign, thirty villages were burned, at least three hundred Druze were killed and three hundred Druze women and children were taken captive. His campaigns were celebrated by the Sunni Muslim scholars and poets of Damascus. H√ºrrem was later appointed beylerbey of the Kayseri-based Karaman Eyalet in Anatolia. He was killed in the plain of Kayseri on 28 August 1526 attempting to suppress rebellious Turkmen tribes, who had launched a revolt in Anatolia that year. H√ºrrem's troops consequently fled and the rebels captured the horses, weapons and treasure of H√ºrrem's camp. On their way to join the kizilbas rebels in Azerbaijan, they were routed and massacred in Diyarbakir by Ottoman troops led by H√ºsrev Pasha, the beylerbey of Aleppo Eyalet.

The original station was built where the current Viaduct Presidente Tancredo Neves is located, in 1986. In 1971, Ferrovia Paulista S/A (FEPASA) absorbed EFS, and remodeled the West Line, and Comandante Sampaio station was rebuilt on 25 January 1979.

She is the Michelle Mercer and Bruce Golden Family Professor of Women‚Äôs Leadership Director at Stanford University. Early life and education Correll was born and raised in Houston, Texas, to a police officer father and stay-at-home mother, neither of whom went to college. Growing up, her family was big fans of the Houston Astros and she saw games played in the Astrodome. Upon earning her Bachelor of Arts degree from Texas A&M; University, Correll became a high school chemistry teacher while also interning at Dow Chemical Company and taking master‚Äôs levels classes in sociology at the University of Houston. She noticed that the boys in her chemistry class were undetered by setbacks while the girls lacked confidence to believe they were good at chemistry in spite of good grades. Correll was encouraged by one of her professors to apply for a PhD in sociology and received a full scholarship to Stanford University. Her thesis was focused on \\"the way that stereotypes about fields affect the extent to which men and women come to see themselves as being skilled in that area.\\" While working towards her thesis, she earned funding from Stanford's Institute for Research on Women and Gender to study why women and men end up in sex- segregated fields or specialties. Career Upon graduating with her PhD from Stanford, Correll was extended a faculty position at the institution's sociology program. Upon accepting the position, she co-led a gender-equity directive called CU-ADVANCE, with funding from the National Science Foundation. The aim of the initiative was to recruit more women for engineering and science faculty positions. One of the results of this directive found that women were underrepresented at Cornell's sciences, engineering, social science, behavioral science, and math programs and felt less satisfied in their positions. As co-director of the Advancing Cornell's Commitment to Excellence and Leadership, Correll also began developing the Motherhood penalty theory, which argued that women with children were considered less competent and dedicated than their childless or male coworkers. Working alongside graduate student Stephen Benard, they authored Getting a Job: Is There a Motherhood Penalty? and Cognitive Bias and the Motherhood Penalty. They surveyed paid undergraduate student-volunteers to evaluate fake resumes and determine which person would be the best to head a new marketing department. All students were given equally qualified, same- gender profiles with different parental status. The conclusion of the survey determined that participants viewed mothers as significantly less competent and committed than women without children. As a result of her research, Corell was the recipient of a 2008 Alice H. Cook and Constance E. Cook Award and 2009 Rosabeth Moss Kanter Award for Excellence in Work Family Research. Correll was promoted to Full professor of Sociology in 2012 and later named the inaugural Director of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research, a center aimed at promoting women‚Äôs leadership in business, government and education. In this role, Correll authored a new method for reducing gender biases and inequalities within the workforce which focuses on re-education. She led a research team over three years using this method of re-education with several technology companies, resulting in positive outcomes. When speaking of her method, Correll said it focused on \\"educating managers and workers about bias, diagnosing where gender bias could enter their company‚Äôs hiring, promotion or other evaluation practices and working with the company‚Äôs leaders to develop tools that help measurably reduce bias and inequality.\\" In recognition of her efforts, Correll received the 2017 Feminist Mentor Award by Sociologists for Women in Society. Correll stepped down as director of the Clayman Institute for Gender Research after nine years and was replaced by Adrian Daub. She was introduced to Michelle Mercer during her tenure as director and was specifically appointed the Michelle Mercer and Bruce Golden Family Professor of Women‚Äôs Leadership Director in 2019 as a \\"tribute of her important work.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Living people Category:Texas A&M; University alumni Category:Stanford University alumni Category:Stanford University faculty Category:American sociologists Category:American women sociologists Category:Academics from Houston ","title":"Shelley Correll"},{"id":"64976408","text":"Syrus Marcus Ware is a Black, transgender, disabled artist, activist and scholar.

Much of the ecoregion has been converted to agriculture along the floodplain of the middle course of the Mekong River.  Location and description  The ecoregion follows the floodplain of the Mekong River for 350 km along the border between Thailand and Laos. Vientaine, the capital city of Laos, is near the western edge of the region. The river through this region cuts through a number of low mountain ridges that reach to 800 meters, although the majority of the ecoregion is on the river plain averaging 200 meters.  Climate  The climate of the ecoregion is Tropical monsoon climate (K√∂ppen climate classification (Aw)). This climate is characterized by relatively even temperatures throughout the year (all months being greater than average temperature), and a pronounced dry season. The driest month has less than 60 mm of precipitation, but more than (100-(average/25) mm. This climate is mid-way between a tropical rainforest and a tropical savannah. The dry month usually at or right after the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere. Precipitation in this ecoregion has averaged 1,629 mm/year in recent years.  Flora and fauna  About 42% is given over to agriculture, about 50% is closed or open forest, and the remainder is urbanized, scrub, or water. Most of the forest is semi-evergreen deciduous trees, characterized by Lagerstroemia angustifolia (a species of myrtle tree), Afzelia xylocarpa, Xylia xylocarpa (a hardwood with bright yellow flowers), Peltophorum dasyrrhachis (another deciduous tree with yellow flowers), and the Burma padauk (Pterocarpus macrocarpus). Within the forests of this ecoregion, the dry evergreen portion contain more species of mammals than the deciduous forest which produces less suitable food. Mammal species include the endangered Pileated gibbon (Hylobates pileatus) and the endangered wild Asian elephant (Elephas maximus). There are also sites of high biodiversity along the banks of the Mekong River, with extensive habitat of shifting sand bars and exposed bedrock. A popular cover in these riverine habitats is willow-leaved water croton (Homonoia riparia) which grows in wet soils near the river.  Protected Areas  A little more than 2% of the ecoregion is Protected: * Phou Khao Khouay, a mixture of river plain and mountainous territory 40 km northeast of Vientaine, Loas. * Phu Kao‚ÄìPhu Phan Kham National Park, a mountainous region in Thailand south of Vientaine.

As such, it fought alongside the Allies against the Axis. While no large scale battles or major military operations took place in or around Eswatini, the colony did supply the Allies with troops during the war. World War II was also responsible for several important domestic developments in Eswatini. History Sobhuza II, the King of Eswatini at the time the war broke out, struck a deal with the British government, agreeing to help gather volunteers for the war effort within the country in exchange for the British allowing for greater Swazi autonomy in the future. A few thousand Swazi men ended up volunteering to fight alongside the Allies. Swazi soldiers served in Egypt and Libya during the Western Desert campaign, part of the larger North Africa campaign, and also participated in the Allied invasion of Italy. One notable Swazi veteran of the war is Mnikwa Dlamini, who later became the Chief of Hhelehhele. Domestically, World War II led directly to the Swazi government's implementation of new administrative subdivisions in Eswatini called tinkhundla. Those Swazi soldiers who served in the war and had spent time in modern African port cities like Tripoli and Durban relayed their wartime experiences to King Sobhuza II and recommended to their monarch that he establish several community centers across the kingdom. These community centers, called inkhundla, eventually developed into the tinkhundla system found in Eswatini today. Swazi veterans of World War II also influenced their home country in that they eventually came to occupy several important leadership positions within the Swazi military. The political and economic situation of the post-war world eventually allowed Eswatini to gain independence from the British Empire in 1968, as part of a much larger trend of decolonization across the world. A memorial to Swazi soldiers who served in World War II was constructed near the mission of Bethany, located just outside of the town of Matsapha. The memorial records the names of 53 Swazi soldiers who died after returning to their home country, as well as those of 24 Swazi soldiers who died in Egypt. All Swazi soldiers not mentioned by name elsewhere are commemorated on the memorial's plaque, written in Siswati.

The lyrics of the song are autobiographical and tell a love affair that Marilina Ross had on the beaches of Puerto Pollensa, a town north of Mallorca in the Balearic Islands. The ban on music in English imposed by the dictatorship during the Falklands War in 1982 greatly benefited the careers of Argentine popular musicians, among them Mihanovich and Ross. \\"Puerto Pollensa\\" received a lot of radio airplay and was a commercial success, reaching number one on Cashboxs Argentine single's chart in July 1982. This context also allowed Ross to sign a record deal with Discos CBS and release the album Soles that year, which included her own rendition of \\"Puerto Pollensa\\". Nevertheless, the dictatorship still prevented her from promoting the album on television or on public radio. \\"Puerto Pollensa\\" is regarded as a quintessential gay anthem in Argentina and an icon of 1980s lesbian culture. Background Sandra Mihanovich (left) and Marilina Ross (right) photographed in 1982. Marilina Ross began her career as an actress in the 1960s and by 1975 was at her peak of popularity, thanks to her roles in Lautaro Mur√∫a's acclaimed film La Raulito and the Alberto Migr√©-penned telenovela Piel naranja. The year before, she had made her debut as a recording artist with the album Estados de √°nimo, fulfilling the \\"dream of her life\\". In 1976, a coup d'√©tat installed the last civil-military dictatorship in Argentina, inaugurating a period of state terrorism known as the Dirty War. Due to her Peronist activism, Ross received death threats and was prohibited from continuing to work, so she had to leave the country at the height of her career. She went into exile in Spain, where she had several job offers due to the box office success of La Raulito. The estrangement from her loved ones and her country was very distressing for Ross, who defined the time in exile as the worst stage of her life. In July 1980, Ross' friend and fellow actor Luis Politti died, who was also exiled in Madrid. According to her, he died of sadness, and she felt that she would be the next to die if she did not return to Argentina. Ross composed \\"Puerto Pollensa\\" just before returning to her home country, referring to a love affair she had in the town of the same name located north of Mallorca, in the Balearic Islands. She recorded it with her guitar on a cassette tape and gave it to her significant other, inteded to be a personal gift and a \\"snapshot\\" of the moment they lived together. The recipient of the song is rumored to be the feminist writer Susana Torres Molina. Ross has said that the new love she found in Puerto Pollensa made her \\"climb out of the hole\\", and led her to return to Argentina, despite the fact that the dictatorship that had threatened her was still in power. Ross and singer Sandra Mihanovich met in late 1980 through their mutual friend Alejandro Doria, who invited the latter to a party at Emilio Alfaro's house to welcome Ross back to the country. Ross and Alfaro had divorced years ago, but they were still friends and he hosted her as soon as she returned from exile. During the gathering, she performed the recently written \\"Puerto Pollensa\\" on her guitar for the guests and, upon hearing it, Mihanovich immediately asked her permission to record it. Ross initially flatly refused, as it was an intimate gift she had never thought to release, but agreed when she insisted. Ross told P√°gina/12 in 2013: \\"The Sandra thing was key. And I was not even completely convinced by the song. I said: 'Oh, that chorus... how square it is!' I changed it, put other music on it, turned it over. It seemed to me that the music was very obvious, low quality, no? In the end it beat me, I couldn't change it and I left it as it was.\\" Mihanovich was part of a new wave of musical acts that performed in a circuit of small bars centered in Buenos Aires, including Celeste Carballo, Horacio Fontova, Alejandro Lerner, La Torre and Rub√©n Rada. Since 1980, Mihanovich was a house act in Shams, a tea house turned pub in Belgrano that became an iconic venue of the 1980s. Composition \\"Puerto Pollensa\\" is a love song that tells the story of two people that overcome the fear that prevented them from being together. Although never explicitly, the lyrics subtly refer to a romantic encounter between two women, with some of the clues including the lyrics \\"Me naci√≥ este amor, sin que me diera cuenta yo/Tal vez el miedo no dej√≥ que apareciera\\" (English: \\"This love was born without me realizing it/Maybe fear didn't let it appear\\") and the metaphor of a \\"seed that cannot see the light\\" (Spanish: \\"una semilla que no puede ver la luz\\"). What is commonly interpreted as the confirmation comes at the end of the song, with the oft-cited lyrics: \\"Y sin dormir nos fuimos a la playa y nos besamos descaradamente/Alucinando al gordito de gafas que fue corriendo a cambiarse los lentes\\" (English: \\"And without sleep we went to the beach and shamelessly kissed each other/Astounding the chubby guy that ran to change his glasses\\"). Ross has said that the lyrics in part refer to how she felt when assuming her attraction to women, with lyrics that speak of \\"fear\\" and \\"panic\\", as well as the need to leave that behind. She explained: \\"At that time I was very consubstantial with the internal change. I thought the revolution had to go through your own head.\\" Release and reception \\"Puerto Pollensa\\" was first released as a 7-inch single by Sandra Mihanovich in late 1981 on MICSA, a subsidiary of label Microf√≥n, along with the Alejandro Lerner-penned song \\"Simple\\" as its B-side. To avoid censorship, Marilina Ross was credited under her legal name Mar√≠a Celina Parrondo. \\"Puerto Pollensa\\" was included as the title track of Mihanovich's second studio album, released in June 1982. The outbreak of the Falklands War on April 2, 1982 led the military government to ban music in English on radio stations, which made local Spanish-language music, especially the previously censored Argentine rock (known locally as rock nacional), expand to unprecedented limits. Mihanovich is said to have been \\"at the right time with the right record\\", releasing the album a week before the war ended. \\"Puerto Pollensa\\" was a commercial success. In July 1982, it topped the Argentine singles chart reported by Prensario for Cashbox magazine. The Puerto Pollensa album had a lot of airplay on Argentine radio during 1982 and at the end of that year Mihanovich gave two massive concerts at the iconic Estadio Obras Sanitarias, becoming the first woman to perform in the venue known as \\"the cathedral of national rock\\". Mihanovich has included live versions of the song on various albums, including Sandra en Shams (1985), Sandra en vivo (1998), and Creciendo: En vivo en el √ìpera (2007). Marilina Ross version The success of Ross' live performances, as well as the good reception of Mihanovich's version of \\"Puerto Pollensa\\", were attractive to record companies eager for new materials. The outbreak of war and consequent ban on music in English also fueled her musical career, allowing her to get a record deal. She recalled in 2011: \\"The Falklands War came, music was banned in English, and there I went from being prohibited to having three record labels vying for my presence. So I finally could choose between three labels to be able to record my songs! Thanks to a war, how terrible.\\" Her studio album Soles was released in November 1982 on Discos CBS and included her own version of \\"Puerto Pollensa\\", considered one of the highlights of the record. The album was produced by the songwriting duo Piero-Jos√©, formed by musicians Piero de Benedictis and Jos√© Tcherkaski. Ross presented Soles with three concerts held on November 26, 27 and 28 at the Teatro Ode√≥n, a show in which she combined music with monologues, jointly written with Susana Torres Molina. Since the name Marilina Ross was technically still banned, the songs could only be played on private radio stations‚ÄîContinental, Rivadavia or del Plata‚Äîand she was prevented from promoting Soles on television. To promote Soles, Discos CBS released \\"Puerto Pollensa\\" as a promotional single in Spain in 1984, with \\"Como mis padres\\" as its B-side. Legacy Considered the first Argentine popular song to thematize love between women, \\"Puerto Pollensa\\" became an enduring gay anthem, especially among the lesbian community, released at a time when the secrecy of non-heterosexual relationships was a source of shared codes and interpretations of cultural products. Journalist and activist Marta Dillon wrote in 2010 that \\"thirty years later lesbians of all ages continue singing the entire lyrics by heart\\". The song had an important role in the process of visibility of homosexuality that took place in Argentina after the return to democratic rule in 1983. Mihanovich has said that the song \\"served to make women love each other more\\". Advertisements in the 1990s activist periodical La Hora L√©sbica show the existence of lesbian bars named after the song in Buenos Aires. Despite becoming icons of the burgeoning gay culture of 1980s Argentina, both Mihanovich and Ross refused to speak publicly about their non-heterosexuality for decades, although this was considered an open secret. Nevertheless, Mihanovich has said on several occasions that she does not consider herself an LGBT activist. She told La Capital in 2019: \\"I have had the fortune to say what I thought, what I felt, I had the consistent attitude for many years, like more or less everything I could say I could do, I have not been a great activist, I do not feel like an activist. I do feel that I was choosing songs and saying things that I felt and that this coincided with the feelings of many others. So I opened doors for me and opened doors for others as well. What more can one ask for.\\" \\"Puerto Pollensa\\" is regarded as a classic. The Argentine edition of Rolling Stone and MTV ranked the song 83rd on their 2002 list of the \\"100 Hits of Argentine Rock\\". In 2019, Chilean musician Javiera Mena mentioned Sandra Mihanovich and the song \\"Puerto Pollensa\\" when asked about her \\"lesbian role models in music\\". Usage in media and cover versions \\"Puerto Pollensa\\" was featured in the 2002 hit television series Los simuladores as a favorite song of Mart√≠n Seefeld, a main character played by Gabriel David Medina. Italian singer Iva Zanicchi covered \\"Puerto Pollensa\\" and included it as the closing track of her 1982 Spanish-language album Yo, por amarte. It was also recorded under the title \\"Renaci√≥ este amor\\" by Puerto Rican singer Sophy in 1983, as part of her album Comp√°rame. In 2017, the Argentine duo Ibiza Pareo released a cover version of the song. Charts {class=\\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\\"  - ! Chart (1982) !

The fire was started by a lightning strike on August 17, 2020 in the Vaca Mountains in Rutherford in Napa County. The Hennessey Fire was the largest of a complex of fires, known as the LNU Lightning Complex, all of which were caused by the impact of Tropical Storm Fausto, which fueled a thunderstorm moving through the area during a heat wave. The fire has burned and is 75 percent contained as of September 2, 2020. The fire has resulted in mandatory evacuations, including of wineries and residences. It currently threatens an estimated 15,000 structures and has destroyed 633 structures and damaged 179, including homes. Four people were killed in the Hennessey Fire. By itself, the Hennessey Fire is the seventh-largest wildfire ever recorded in California, and the largest fire ever in Napa County. Events=August The fire, which was first called the 14-3 Fire, was first reported burning near Hennessey Ridge Road in Rutherford, California in Napa County around 6:42 AM on August 17, 2020. The fire was started by a lightning strike during a series of thunderstorms traveling through Northern California as a result of Tropical Storm Fausto. Initially it was only large. However, dry conditions and strong, gusty winds throughout the morning of August 17 caused the fire to explode to 750 acres and then to by 5 PM, promting evacuations for parts of Chiles Valley and the area near Lake Hennessey. The next day, August 18, CAL FIRE announced that one house and two outbuildings had been destroyed and evacuations for Butts Canyon and Snell Valley, including communities on the east coast of Lake Berryessa, were announced. That night, Hennessey had burned and was not contained. Additional fires had started in Napa County on August 17: the Gamble, Markley, Spanish, and 15-10 Fires - all part of the LNU Lightning Complex. The Hennessey Fire featured in a video, by the State of California, about COVID-19 protocols in place at evacuation centers. Additional evacuations continued on August 19 as the fire grew, including unincorporated areas of Napa, Howell Mountain, Angwin, Deer Park, and Aetna Springs. That same day, evacuations were put in place for areas of southeastern Lake County resulting from the Aetna Fire, burning in Aetna Springs and near the Lake County border. That day, the Hennessey Fire had absorbed the five other fires in the area: Gamble, Green, Markley, Spanish Fire and Morgan Fire, encompassing and collectively destroying 105 structures and damaging 70. After merging with Markley, the Hennessey fire zone had expanded to Vacaville and Fairfield, resulting in additional evacuations. By 4 PM, the fire had crossed Interstate 80, resulting in the interstate's closure, and Travis Air Force Base was evacuated. By 9 PM, the fire was quelled near I-80 and the interstate was reopened. Additionally, a Pacific Gas and Electric Company employee was found unresponsive in their vehicle, transported to a hospital and declared dead. Four civilians were also reported injured by CAL FIRE. By the evening of August 20, CAL FIRE reported that four civilians had died, specifically three in Napa and one in Solano County. That same day, the Hennessey had merged with the Round Fire in southern Lake County, growing the size of the fire to . Extreme fire behavior and long range spotting by the fire kept it challenging for firefighters. The Hennessey was declared 15 percent contained by CAL FIRE on August 21, the first progress in fire containment. The next day, the National Weather Service stated that another lightning storm threatened the area. It did not come to fruition, with the Red Flag Warning put in place being canceled, on the 21st, before it was set to expire. Hennessey had grown to over by August 23. Containment progress was made on the eastern and south sides of the fire, encompassing the portion where the fire burned in Solano County. The following day, residents on Atlas Peak and other unincorporated areas of Napa were allowed to return to their homes. Weather conditions improved, enabling crews to gain further containment, with dozer lines expanding, more hand crews arriving and air support continuing, specifically on the southern, easter and western flanks. By August 26, the northern flank was the most active, spreading further into Lake County, just south of Middletown, and over the Yolo County line towards Colusa County, crossing Highway 16, resulting in more evacuations, including Guenoc. The California National Guard was called in to serve as hand crews, working alongside firefighters to contain the fire. Approximately 4,000 residents of Angwin were allowed to re-populate on August 28, along with the reopening of St. Helena Hospital. Evacuation orders were lifted for Deer Park on the 27th. September As of September 2, 2020, the Hennessey Fire is and 75 percent contained. Impact The Hennessey Fire destroyed homes, farms, ranches and additional property in four counties. Over 17,000 people were evacuated. Air quality was heavily impacted for weeks in the San Francisco Bay Area. The fire also interrupted tourism season in wine country and the wine grape harvest in Napa, Lake and Solano Counties. Evacuations and closures Hennessey Fire road block along the Silverado Trail in Napa. Hennessey Fire resulted in evacuations in five Northern California counties: Napa, Lake, Solano, Yolo and Colusa. An estimated 17,000 residents in Napa County were evacuated. Napa County evacuations included parts of Napa Valley's Wine Country, homes, and resorts and neighborhoods around Lake Berryessa, including Aetna Springs, Angwin, Snell Valley, Atlas Peak, Chiles Valley, Steele Canyon, Pope Valley, Deer Park, Howell Mountain, and unincorporated areas of Napa. The fire also resulted in the evacuation of 51 patients from St. Helena Hospital. Eventually, the fire moved closer to Lake County, resulting in evacuations in Hidden Valley Lake, Jerusalem Valley, and Guenoc. Portions of Vacaville and Fairfield in Solano County, California and Yolo & Colusa County were also evacuated. The fire also resulted in major road closures throughout the fire region, including the Interstate 80, which is crossed during rush hour, the Silverado Trail, Highway 128 and Highway 121. Structural and economic impact The Hennessey Fire has destroyed 633 structures and damaged 943 in Napa, Yolo and Solano Counties. Of those structures destroyed, 254 were single-family homes in Napa County and 280 were in Solano County. The fire destroyed the majority of mobile homes in the Spanish Flat Mobile Villa in Spanish Flat, leaving only a handful of structures standing. The fire also destroyed many homes in Berryessa Highlands. The fire also impacted agricultural communities near Vacaville, including an olive farm. Numerous livestock was lost in the fire. At least of rangeland was destroyed near Lake Berryessa, resulting in loss land for feeding cattle, requiring ranchers to purchase food. Air quality The fire impacted air quality throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, triggering Spare the Air days. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a shortage of N95 masks resulted in many farmworkers not having access to appropriate masks to work in poor air conditions. Appropriate protective masks are required to be provided to farmworkers by employers when the air quality is poor. The California Department of Food and Agriculture acquired 1 million N95 masks from the California Office of Emergency Services state stockpile to distribute to farmworkers. Fatalities Five people died in the Hennessey Fire. On August 19, a Pacific Gas & Electric employee was found unresponsive in his vehicle in Gates Canyon in Solano County. CPR was performed and he was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead. The employee had been clearing infrastructure in the Gates Canyon area. Additionally, three individuals died in Napa, burned to death in a house. An additional civilian in Solano County was also killed in the fire.

Olfactory language refers to language associated with the sense of smell. It involves the naming and categorisation of odours by humans according to each odour's perceived source or attributes. The study of olfactory language is part of the field of linguistics and is distinct from the study of semiochemical communication, which involves communication between organisms using chemical substances detected through olfaction. Cross-linguistic variation= Olfactory perception and identification  Different speech communities tend to display differences in both the perception and linguistic categorisation of odours. In general, Europeans find it harder to identify odours than hunter- gatherer communities. The ease with which odours are identified by speakers is related to the primary type of olfactory vocabulary used in their speech community. Some speech communities, including Jahai- and Thai-speaking hunter- gatherers, mostly use dedicated abstract vocabulary for referring to odour qualities, while others, such as Dutch and English speakers, mostly use concrete terms that identify the source itself. When presented with common odours and asked to name them, Jahai speakers are likely to use the same abstract descriptor and answer more quickly, while English and Dutch speakers tend to take longer to answer and use a more diverse range of mostly concrete descriptors, suggesting that abstract and concrete odour names are encoded differently. The nature of odour-colour associations also differs between speech communities based on their vocabulary. Dutch speakers who use concrete terms associate a particular odour with the colour of its source (e.g., banana odour associated with the colour yellow), while Maniq and Thai speakers who use abstract terminology do not show consistent odour-colour associations. Olfactory metaphor Cross-linguistically, olfactory metaphor is traditionally thought to be the least important of all the senses, especially when compared to visual or auditory metaphors, although emerging research suggests the phenomenon is more common than previously thought. In English, olfactory metaphors with negative connotations are often used to describe bad character (\\"he's a stinker\\") or the detection of bad qualities (\\"I smell something fishy about this deal\\"). In the Seri language, olfactory metaphor and metonymy are salient features. One example is the expression hiisax cheemt iha (\\"I am angry\\"), literally 'my.spirit stinks (Declarative)'. Variation within languages Different populations speaking the same language and sharing cultural traditions may still display varied perceptions of an odour, based on its prevalence and most common source in each location. For example, one study showed that French speakers in Quebec find the scent of wintergreen more pleasant and edible than speakers in France. This is because the odour is commonly used in candies and sodas in North America, while in Europe it is used mainly in medicinal products. However, providing concrete names of the source of the odours caused cultural differences in responses to decrease or disappear, suggesting that providing more linguistic information about an odour tends to make its perception more salient in the mind of the smeller. Clinical applications In a clinical setting, patients may undergo olfactory tests to aid in the diagnosis of mental disorders. A common test involves the use of \\"Sniffin' Sticks\\", a set of marker pens imbued with different scents at varying dilutions. Sniffin' Sticks are used both for diagnosis and for research into olfaction, including olfactory language. Due to linguistic variation across speech communities, the Sniffin' Sticks test must be validated for each country in which medical professionals wish to use it for diagnosis. Rather than using a literal translation of scent descriptors, researchers validating the test in a new country may need to change the translated descriptors to more culturally-appropriate terms for the speech community in question. For example, researchers validating the Sniffin' Sticks test for the Portuguese population changed the original translation of the grapefruit scent descriptor, toranja, to the Portuguese word for orange, laranja. This is because grapefruit are not commonly eaten in Portugal, which resulted in participant familiarity falling below the benchmark of 75%. Altering lesser known descriptors such as \\"grapefruit\\" to less literal but more culturally-relevant translations increased familiarity to within the range expected for healthy populations. This validated the Sniffin' Sticks test for the Portuguese population without requiring the scents themselves to be altered.

Story  The story of Lord Longyang is recorded in the Records of the Warring States (or Zhangguo ce) in a section called \\"Records of Wei,\\" (or Wei ce) and does not appear in any other sources. The Records of the Warring States is generally considered a work of history. In it, Lord Longyang and the king are in a fishing boat together when Longyang begins to cry. After the king pressures him to say why he is crying, Longyang reveals that he is afraid that the king will be tempted by other, more beautiful men, and lose interest in him. The king then forbid anyone to mention other beauties in his presence under penalty of death. As a result of his status as a favorite of the king, Lord Longyang was given a small fief and a feudal title. His story took place sometime between 276 and 243 BCE, and is the second account of a male same-sex relationship in Chinese historical records.  Influence  In his book Passions of the Cut Sleeve: The Male Homosexual Tradition in China, Bret Hinsch writes that the story of Lord Longyang serves as an example of both the sexual opportunism and openness of homosexuality in Zhou dynasty courts. The 1632 book The Forgotten Tales of Longyang (or The Forgotten Stories of Longyang) tells twenty stories of male same-sex prostitution in the late Ming dynasty. In it, the author, known by the nom de plume \\"Jingjiang's besotted with bamboo recluse,\\" uses the story of Lord Longyang to evoke an earlier golden age characterized by feeling. In the poetry of Ruan Ji, Lord Longyang is used, along with Anling, to figuratively evoke male beauty and love between men, and specifically royal favor. The word longyang is also used in China to euphemistically refer to gay men, and has been through much of Chinese history.

His personal life, particularly his marriage to Naya Rivera, has garnered significant media attention. Early life Ryan Keith Dorsey was born in the small coal mining town of Chesapeake, near Charleston, West Virginia, on July 19, 1983. After attending middle school in West Virginia, he moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, for high school. He said that he decided to move to Charlotte, where his mother lived, because he felt that in a bigger city he would have more sporting opportunities. However, he returned to West Virginia and joined Riverside High School when it became consolidated. He had not intended this, but received a head injury while visiting his father on Thanksgiving; subsequent medical treatments in his hometown kept him there. He became interested in acting during his senior year of high school after a football injury prevented him from playing and he was encouraged to join theatre; his high school theatre program was run by a professional Hollywood actor taking time off. Dorsey studied theatre at Western Carolina University, with plans to join their football team, but dropped out and moved to New York City during his freshman year, enrolling at the New York Conservatory for Dramatic Arts. Career Dorsey began acting professionally shortly after moving to New York, working primarily in television, taking his first roles in 2013 on Southland and Parks and Recreation. He is mainly known for his recurring role as Earl on Justified in 2015, and then Dime Bag on Ray Donovan in 2017, and his other appearances include recurring roles on Pitch, Bosch, Yellowstone, Runaways, Stumptown, The Vampire Diaries and Nashville. He was originally contracted for a three episode arc on Justified, before being bumped to five and then ten episodes of the thirteen-episode season. On Pitch he portrayed Tommy Miller, a member of the baseball team who objects to a woman joining the team, and he played Blake in the second season of Yellowstone. His debut feature film role came in 2016's Blood Father, a French film in the English language starring Mel Gibson, with Dorsey in a small role as the drug dealer Shamrock. Personal life Naya Rivera in 2010; Dorsey and Rivera were married between 2014 and 2018. Dorsey met actress Naya Rivera in 2010, and they briefly dated before splitting because, as Dorsey's father described it, Dorsey was \\"a playboy\\". Rivera revealed in a 2016 memoir that she had an abortion in 2010, shortly after splitting from Dorsey, due to the fact that her career was taking off with her successful role on Glee. In 2011, Cosmopolitan named Dorsey West Virginia's most eligible bachelor. Rivera and Dorsey got together again in 2014 after her messy split from rapper Big Sean, which is when she told him about the abortion; she said that he was supportive and respectful when she did. Dorsey and Rivera married in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, on Dorsey's birthday, July 19, 2014; they did not announce the engagement or wedding until several days later on July 23. In February 2015, the couple announced that they were expecting their first child, and their son, Josey Hollis, was born on September 17, 2015. Josey was being raised by his mother as bilingual in Spanish and English, due to her multi-ethnic background. In November 2016, Rivera filed for divorce after two years of marriage, but called off the separation in October 2017. Over Thanksgiving 2017, Rivera was arrested and charged in Kanawha County, West Virginia, with misdemeanor domestic battery against Dorsey after she allegedly hit him in the head during an altercation over their child, and was picked up from the courthouse by Dorsey's father. She subsequently refiled for divorce in December 2017, and in January 2018 the domestic battery charge was dismissed at the request of Dorsey, who \\"notified both the prosecution and the defense counsel that he was no longer seeking prosecution and has confirmed he was never at any time injured by the conduct of Ms. Rivera\\". On June 14, 2018, Rivera and Dorsey finalized their divorce, sharing joint custody of Josey, with both waiving rights to child support. The joint custody agreement was modified in March 2020, giving Rivera primary custody while stipulating Dorsey \\"be afforded frequent and meaningful custodial contact\\". After Rivera's death in July 2020, Dorsey obtained sole custody.
