Born in London, England, Stanton broke into the film industry at the very tail end of the silent film era in 1927, appearing in several film shorts for Hal Roach Studios. He would debut in a feature film with a small role in Raoul Walsh's 1928 silent film, Sadie Thompson, starring Gloria Swanson, Lionel Barrymore, and Walsh. During the following 20 years he would appear in another 70 films, mostly in small and supporting roles. Notable films in which he appeared include: the 1933 version of Alice in Wonderland, whose ensemble cast included Cary Grant, W.C. Fields, Gary Cooper and Edward Everett Horton; the classic Mutiny on the Bounty (1935), starring Charles Laughton and Clark Gable; the 1936 film adaptation of James Fenimore Cooper's classic, Last of the Mohicans, directed by George B. Seitz, and starring Randolph Scott; The Prince and the Pauper (1937), starring Errol Flynn and Claude Rains; Howard Hawks' 1941 classic, Sergeant York, with Gary Cooper; and The Ghost and Mrs. Muir (1947), directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and starring Gene Tierney, Rex Harrison, and George Sanders. His final big screen appearance would be as a cab driver in the Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn romantic comedy, Adam's Rib, directed by George Cukor. Stanton would make one last acting performance, appearing on an episode of television's Schlitz Playhouse in 1954. Stanton died on December 18, 1969 in Los Angeles, California, and was buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale.

While incarcerated he developed groundbreaking communication and motivational skills that led to his fame and freedom. Family His father was 56-year-old actor, Harry Eytinge, who moved to Dayton, Ohio, in about 1877 to manage a theater and run a drama school. In January 1878 he married one of his pupils, 22-year-old Ida Seebohm.Ida‚Äôs parents were Susan Grodhaus and Louis Seebohm from Germany. Seebohm was a photographer (using an early process called Daguerreotype) and artist located in Dayton. He died of fever in Brazil while traveling to Chatham Island on the Transit of Venus, 1874 expedition Their son, Louis Victor Eytinge, was born in September of the same year. His parents divorced three years after his birth and he and his mother lived at the home of an aunt and uncle. Crime His education at the Notre Dame College was cut short after he was accused of writing dud cheques. He next tried a career in the US Navy but was court- martialed for theft. Back in civilian life he continued his criminal ways and in 1903 was imprisoned for forgery, serving 3 years in the Ohio State Prison. In 1907 he met and befriended John Leicht, an asthmatic who was traveling to Arizona for health reasons. On March 17 the two hired a rig and took a trip to the desert outside of Phoenix. Later that day Eytinge returned alone and left town. Suspicion was aroused when Eytinge‚Äôs cheques bounced, plus the explanation he had given for his friend‚Äôs absence proved to be untrue. On 24 March, a week after his disappearance, Leicht‚Äôs body was found in the desert. Empty containers of chloroform and knock out drops found near the body led the authorities to conclude that Eytinge had drugged Leicht. Prison Eytinge was arrested in San Francisco and stood trial in Arizona for murder; he was found guilty and given life imprisonment. He was ill with tuberculosis and to survive in prison he had to supplement his diet, but this required money that he did not have. Other prisoners made trinkets for sale to visitors, such as hatbands, belt buckles, and so on. Eytinge saw an opportunity to expand the market and started to write to prospective customers in areas such as Texas, California and New Mexico. His efforts were so successful, that he was able to purchase the essentials he needed to improve his health, plus provide a few comforts. He was moved from Yuma to a new prison in Florence where he continued his marketing activities, often writing advertising letters for companies, earning it was said up to ¬£5000 a year. He also studied the penal system, corresponded with Arizona‚Äôs new governor, George W. P. Hunt - who sought his advice on reform - and became involved with the welfare of other prisoners. Eytinge expanded his commercial enterprises into marketing via direct-mail. His success attracted the attention of the advertising industry; newspaper articles were written about him and trade publications sought his creative input. He edited a magazine, wrote stories and had a screen play accepted for a film (Man Under Cover). A campaign developed to have him paroled and in December 1922 he was released. Within days he married Pauline Lydia Diver, with whom he had corresponded when in jail. Freedom and return to prison For a period he had celebrity status, earning and spending big money. However, within a few years he returned to his old criminal ways to fund his lifestyle and parted from his wife. He was arrested in 1931 in California and charged with grand theft, serving his time in San Quentin and Folsom prison.

Its name was inspired on Irish Admiral William Brown's house, built in the same district and painted in yellow. Brown was one of the heroes of Argentine War of Independence leading the Argentine Navy. History William Brown's house, c. 1880. The station (at left) in 1899. Replica of \\"Casa Amarilla\\" in La Boca. In 1812, William Brown (who had arrived to the R√≠o de la Plata three years later) bought a field in La Boca district at the South of Buenos Aires city. On those fields he built a house on Mart√≠n Garc√≠a Avenue. He moved there with his family in 1813 and the house would be soon nicknamed Casa Amarilla (Yellow House) because of its color. In 1857 the Buenos Aires Province Legislature promulgated Law N¬∞ 147 that granted a concession to build a railway from Buenos Aires to Ensenada in La Plata Partido. The works were carried out by Buenos Aires and Ensenada Port Railway (BA&EP;) that made its inaugural trip on September 1, 1865, with a 5-km length. It started in Central Station, placed along with Casa Rosada, running over Paseo Col√≥n through a viaduct until it deviated to Casa Amarilla before crossing Riachuelo to Ensenada. When the Buenos Aires Central Station was destroyed by fire in February 1897, the BA&EP; moved its terminus to Venezuela station (placed on the junction of Paseo Col√≥n and Venezuela) during a brief period of time before moving again to Casa Amarilla. In 1898 the BA&E; was acquired by rival company Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway that took over the line. The BAGSR closed Casa Amarilla station to passengers in 1910, although the station continued operating freight services. With the closing of Casa Amarilla, the BAGSR set Constituci√≥n station as its new terminus for passengers. In 1923 Dutch company Royal Dutch Shell opened a fuel depot on the fields where Casa Amarilla had been. The depot received and stored the tank cars sent from the company's refinery in Dock Sud. On those fields also operated a tram terminus and a potato market (opened in 1946), which was closed in the 1960s. A replica of Admiral Brown's house was built near to its original location, being opened on June 22, 1983, to commemorate the 206th anniversary of Brown's birth. The house currently hosts the Department of Naval Historic Studies and the \\"Instituto Browniano\\", and has a library and a room for multiple uses.

Most were in Poland, though some were also in Western Europe. Not all attempts to save them were successful; for instance, Anne Frank was eventually captured. Methods of hiding Children were hidden in several different ways, each way being traumatic, but those where the child was separated from his or her parents even more traumatic (and see next section).http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/education/newsletter/24/hidden_children.asphttp://www.mjhnyc.org/LISHC/index.htm \\"The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) is a source for information about the Hidden Children - here the ADL describes, with photos, a few Child Survivors, not all being Hidden Children https://www.adl.org/education/educator-resources/lesson- plans/children-of-the-holocaust-a-discussion-guide 1\\\\. A child who was actually hidden with at least one of his parents, in some physical location, such as a secret attic. The family would need at least one outside non-Jewish \\"helper,\\" who brought daily food and other supplies. The lives of the helpers were in extreme danger if the Nazis were to find out this deception, since then they themselves would all be murdered. 2\\\\. A child who was \\"hidden\\" in a convent, as-if one of the other regular Catholic children. The child would have to be able to behave as all the other Catholic convent children behaved - know his prayers, know how to handle a rosary, know how to behave during mass, etc. All these skills the child would have to learn very fast. In this case, at least one of the nuns, and generally more, would have to know that the child was actually Jewish and \\"hiding.\\" Once again, the lives of the nuns were in extreme danger if the Nazis were to find out this deception. 3\\\\. A child who, during the Holocaust, was placed into the care of a \\"foster-family,\\" usually Catholic, and raised as if one of the family. To explain the sudden \\"arrival\\" of this \\"new\\" child into the family, he might for instance be described as a cousin who had come to join this family, perhaps from the countryside. Since he was now a new member of this Catholic family, he too would have to be able to behave as other Catholic children behaved - know his prayers, know how to handle a rosary, know how to behave during mass, etc. Once again, the lives of the true family-members were in extreme danger if the Nazis were to find out this deception. Some such \\"foster-family\\" children were only babies at the time they were \\"placed\\" with a foster-family, others only toddlers or else still very young. The experience of these \\"foster family\\" Hidden Children is very similar to that of the One Thousand Children. 4\\\\. A child \\"hidden\\" by the ≈íuvre de Secours aux Enfants (OSE) as part of their activities in France. (During the war, OSE was unable to continue its earlier work in Poland and elsewhere.) In each of these cases, there had to be at least one non-Jewish, probably Catholic, helper on the outside, who risked his or her own life to help. Whenever there are any records about such a person, that person is designated and honored as a Righteous Gentile. Trauma Hidden Children faced significant trauma during and after World War II.Moskovitz, Sarah \\"LOVE DESPITE HATE - Child Survivors of the Holocaust and their Adult Lives.\\" Schocken Books, New York 1983. .Krell, Robert \\"Child Holocaust Survivors, Memories and Reflections.\\" Trafford Publishing, 2007. . Most importantly, except when the child was in hiding with at least one parent, the Hidden Child had \\"lost\\" his parents and his parental support during the war. Instead he went into the care, good or bad, of strangers. Younger Hidden Children were often too young to remember their parents. Older Hidden Children knew that if they were discovered by the Nazis their fate was dire. After the war, as with nearly all Child Survivors of the Holocaust, the Hidden Child never regained his parents, who nearly surely had been murdered by the Nazis. Usually some difficult delay, generally he would be truly adopted by a caring new family - but the trauma just mentioned would remain with him. Recognition and restitution by German Government In 2014, the German Government, through the Claims Conference, officially arranged to make an extra restitution payment of 2,500 Euros to each such Hidden Child, in addition to any other Restitution for Holocaust experiences to which they were entitled. This was in recognition that any physical or emotional trauma suffered by a child would be greater than that suffered by an adult in similar circumstances, because the child would not yet have developed fully mature coping skills. Due to budgetary constraints, the amount of the payment (about $3,300 at the time) is only a small token, but with high symbolic value.

Rufa'il Zakh√ªr known in France as Rapha√´l de Monachis (1759 - 1831) was an Egyptian-born monk of Syriac ancestry, known for his orientalist studies and for being one of Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion's language teachers. He was born in Cairo to a Syriac-Melkite family. He studied at the Greek seminary in Rome and took his vows at the Basilian Monastery of the Saviour in Sidon where he remained from 1789 to 1794 when he returned to Egypt. During Napoleon's campaign in Egypt he served as Napoleon's personal interpreter. In 1803 he traveled to France where after visiting Joseph Fourier in Grenoble, he traveled to Paris to give important documents to the French government. He was appointed as adjunct professor of Arabic language at the √àcole des Langues Orientales. Among his students there was Champollion, to whom he taught colloquial Arabic and Coptic. He was also the single Arab member of the French Institut d'√âgypte. His colleague there, Silvestre de Sacy, who taught literary Arabic was strongly opposed to having a second professor of Arabic at the School of Oriental languages, considering it a personal offense. In 1803 he participated in the Coronation of Napoleon I and was depicted in Jacques-Louis David's famous painting. Among his unpublished manuscripts was a treatise in Arabic called Marj al-azhar wa bustan al hawadith al Akhbar (\\"The Hubbub of Al Azhar and the Garden of New Events\\"), in which he subtly critiqued the pedagogical methods of the Al-Azhar University by contrasting them to the more organized teaching of the French Academy. In 1816 after the fall of Napoleon at Waterloo, he returned to Egypt where he entered the service of Muhammad 'Ali Pasha.

Personal life Greer was born in Bremerton, Washington and was raised in the Seattle area. He is an initiate in Freemasonry and the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. He currently lives in East Providence, Rhode Island with his wife Sara.  Druidry Greer came to Druidry by way of the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids in 1995 after some twenty years‚Äô involvement in Hermetic occult spirituality. He received the Mount Haemus Award in 2003 from OBOD for his lecture \\"Phallic Religion in the Druid Revival\\". He served as Grand Archdruid of the Ancient Order of Druids in America (AODA), an initiatory organization teaching Celtic nature spirituality, from 2003 - 2015. He wrote The Druidry Handbook, which serves as the AODA‚Äôs core textbook and curriculum. Greer also created the training program for the Druidical Order of the Golden Dawn, an order which fuses druidry with Golden Dawn ceremonial magic, which he founded in 2013. He wrote The Celtic Golden Dawn: An Original & Complete Curriculum of Druidical Study, which serves as the orders‚Äôs core textbook and curriculum.  Politics, blogging, and nonfiction Greer describes himself as a moderate Burkean conservative, influenced by the political theorist Edmund Burke.

He believes that gradual societal collapse will ensue as fossil fuel powered industries and societies decline through resource depletion. In a 2009 blog post entitled \\"Hagbard's Law\\", he contrasted the attention global warming receives compared to peak oil. In a 2005 abstract, called How Civilizations Fall: A Theory of Catabolic Collapse, he wrote an ecological model of collapse in which production fails to meet maintenance requirements for existing capital.

The film features Thanhouser's leading players Anna Rosemond, Martin Faust, Frank H. Crane and Marie Eline in a drama about morality. Two suitors are vying for the hand of Julia Seaton and propose to her on the same day, but she asks for a month to decide between them. In the time the caliber of both men are tested when asked by a young girl, named May, to help her dying mother. The doctor refuses to help and the lawyer offers his assistance, but her mother soon dies. The orphan is taken in by the Seaton family and personally attests to the character of both men when Julia Seaton has to choose between her suitors. The writer, director and cameraman are unknown. Released on May 14, 1910, the film was met with mostly positive reviews by critics. The film is presumed lost.  Plot  Though the film is presumed lost, a surviving synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World. It states: \\"Julia Seaton, a rich heiress, has two suitors, Dr. John Seymour, a wealthy physician, and Richard Calhoun, a poor lawyer. They both propose in the same evening, but while inclined to prefer John, Julia has not yet made a definite choice, and tells both to come back in a month for their answer. The scene shifts to the squalid home of the charwoman, Mrs. Smith, who, ill in bed and unable to earn the rent money, is about to be evicted with her tiny daughter May. The mother faints from weakness, and May rushes for a doctor. She sees Seymour's sign in a window, and asks him to help her mother. Then the man shows his caliber. Because she has no money, he turns her away. Calhoun, the lawyer, meets May, learns of her plight, and, although poor, pays the overdue rent, and the family moved back in the house. But the privation she has suffered proved fatal to the mother and tiny May is left an orphan. On her death bed, Mrs. Smith is found by Miss Seaton, who is visiting the poor quarters on charity work, and on the charwoman's passing, society girl adopts poor little May. The child becomes a happy member of the Seaton family and at the end of the month is a fast friend of the kind-hearted Julia. At the end of a month, too, Julia prepares to decide who shall be her life partner, as promised. But it is little May who really decides. At sight of Seymour, she recalls the physician who turned her away, and denounces him to his own and Miss Julia's face. May recognizes Calhoun as the friend in need, and tells Miss Julia so.

Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman still employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. He was the most important script writer for Thanhouser, averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915. While the director of the film is not known, two Thanhouser directors are possible. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company for a short time, moving to Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. Bowers does not attribute either as the director for this particular production nor does Bowers credit a cameraman. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The leading lady, Anna Rosemond, was one of two leading ladies that Thanhouser would have in its first year of productions. The two suitors vying for her hand in marriage were Martin J. Faust and Frank H. Crane, both of whom were leading men in numerous productions. Frank H. Crane was involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company from 1909. Crane's was the first leading man of the company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser. Bowers credits Martin J. Faust as one of the most important actors for Thanhouser in 1910 and 1911, but Faust's role in productions often went uncredited. The role of a young daughter was Marie Eline, soon to be known and famous as the \\"Thanhouser Kid\\". A possible film still exists for the work and the identity of the actors are complementary in between two identical stills in the Jonathan Silent Film Collection. The description of T-151, identifies the man in the center as Martin Faust and notes the possibility that the still comes from this work. However, the description for T-176 identifies two actors as Harry Benham and Frank Crane, but asserts that the two only worked together in 1911.  Release and reception  The single reel drama, 957 feet long, was released on May 13, 1910. Whether the film is 957 feet or 950 feet long is subject to debate. Bowers notes that some sources state the film is 950 feet long, one such example is the advertising for the film which lists it as being approximately this length. Advertising for the film recognized negativity of Friday the 13th and used it to promote the film to redefine the date to instead bring joy. The film was shown across the United States, advertisements for the showing included theaters in Kansas, Texas, and Pennsylvania. Identifying the theaters showing this work is complicated by the identically named The Best Man Wins by Vitagraph. The silent western produced in 1909 was still being shown and advertised in theaters at the time of the release of Thanhouser's film. An ambiguous advertisement, but most likely Vitagraph reference, is seen in The Hawaiian Star of Hawaii was published on the same day of the Thanhouser release. Reviews for the film were generally positive. The Moving Picture World found the story to be interesting and well acted, giving no criticism of the production. The New York Dramatic Mirror's review criticized the weak plot and the satisfactory acting which was diminished by camera consciousness. The review also found that, \\"[i]n the scene where the child is taken from her mother's death bed too little attention is paid to the corpse.\\" The Leavenworth Times included a review that was favorable and praised the film's photography. The Arkansas City Daily Traveler had an advertisement from the Lotus Theater that stated Thanhouser films were rivaling Independent Moving Pictures. No known existing copies, complete or partial, are known to exist.

Where'd You Go, Bernadette is a 2012 epistolary comedy novel written by Maria Semple. The plot revolves around an agoraphobic architect and mother named Bernadette Fox, who goes missing prior to a family trip to Antarctica. It is narrated by her 15-year-old daughter Bee Branch, and is told in a series of documents (emails, memos, transcripts, etc.) with the occasional interlude by Bee.  Synopsis  After her mother's disappearance, 15-year-old Bee Branch gathers correspondence relating to her mother in order to ascertain what has happened to her. Bee traces the incident back to her perfect report card. Earlier, Bee's parents had told her she could have anything she wanted if she got a perfect report card for all her years in this school. Because of this previous promise, Bee convinces her parents, stay at home mother Bernadette, and father Elgin, a genius who works at Microsoft, to take her to Antarctica. Though Bernadette is mostly housebound she delegates the task of making their arrangements to a personal assistant in India, Manjula. Because she is housebound, Bernadette has an ongoing feud with some of the mothers at Bee's private school with the main instigator being her neighbor Audrey Griffin. Audrey accuses Bernadette of running over her foot with her car (which Bernadette does not dispute, though it is untrue). Bee also learns that her mother was once a famous architect, winner of a MacArthur \\"Genius\\" Grant because of her creation of the 20 Mile house, so called because it was made from material sourced from within 20 miles of the home. After she won the grant, Bernadette sold the house, only to belatedly realize it had been sold to a hostile neighbour who demolished the home as soon as he obtained it. After the defeat Bernadette moved to Seattle where she had four miscarriages before Bee. A friend of Audrey's, Soo-Lin Lee-Segal, an admin at Microsoft, goes to work for Elgin Branch. She reveals to him Bernadette's \\"attacks\\" on Audrey, causing him to question whether to admit Bernadette to a psychiatric institution. As Soo-Lin and Elgin begin an emotional affair, the FBI also contact Elgin to reveal \\"Manjula\\" is actually a Russian money scamming ring who plan to defraud Elgin and Bernadette. Elgin arranges for an intervention with Bernadette at the dentist to reveal these facts to her, but because of a mistake the (unsuccessful) intervention happens at their home with the FBI and police involved. In the middle of the intervention Bernadette goes to the washroom and disappears. Bee has a place at Choate, and in the aftermath of Bernadette's disappearance she is sent to the school early. Soo-Lin reveals to Audrey that she is pregnant with Elgin's child and he has bought them a family home. Elgin and Soo-Lin learn that Bernadette did take the trip to Antarctica herself and go there to confront her only to have her disappear again. During this time Soo-Lin also reveals to Audrey that her life is miserable and that the pregnancy is a result of a drunken one night stand between her and Elgin, who completely regrets the incident. At Choate, Bee receives a package that contains the bulk of the correspondence used in the novel up to that point. It is revealed that after discovering that the accusations she levelled against Bernadette were going to result in her being hospitalized, Audrey helped her escape from her house, showed her all the correspondence between Soo-Lin and her husband, stayed silent when Bernadette decided to go to Antarctica in the hopes that she would be able to speak privately to Elgin and Bee there, and sent the package containing all the correspondence to Bee, in the hopes that Bee would understand what happened with Bernadette. Bee is kicked out of Choate, in part because of the manuscript she is putting together. She guilts her father into going on the trip to Antarctica with her in the name of closure though she secretly believes her mother is hiding there. After nearly giving up hope Bee learns of Palmer Station, an American base where scientists work and research. Stealing a boat with her father, Bee goes to the station where she in fact finds Bernadette who is surprised to find that her family thought she was dead as she sent Bee a letter. Bee finds the missing letter when she returns to her old school. The letter reveals that Bernadette went to Antarctica in the hopes of reconciling with her husband and daughter and decided to stay for the cruise. While there she met a scientist who told her about Palmer Station and an architectural project for the South Pole in which every single material would have to be shipped from the U.S. which meant that it was of the utmost importance for everything to be designed to complete perfection. Bernadette snuck on board Palmer Station hoping to work on the project and sent the letter to Bee asking for her blessing and telling her she would return home if she did not get it within a set period of time.

It was designed by James Furnival for Edward Barton Southerden and built in 1861 with subsequent extensions. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 December 1993.  History  Edward Barton Southerden, circa 1901 The house was built in 1861 for Edward Barton Southerden, a successful Queen Street draper and later first Mayor of Sandgate, to a design by James Furnival who had recently established his practice in Brisbane. Extensions have included an 1876 design by Richard Gailey. Richard Edwards, early 1900s In 1882 it was sold to Richard Edwards who gave the house its Welsh name. Edwards was a partner in the drapery firm Edwards & Chapman, and a director of Telegraph newspapers for thirty years. He became the first member for Oxley in the Australian House of Representatives in 1901 and retired in 1913. In 1896 Edwards bought and demolished the neighbouring Athol Cottage and established Bryntirion's large garden in its place. Richard Edwards died in the house on 29 October 1915. The house remained in the family, occupied by his grandchildren and used as a doctor's surgery.  Description  Bryntirion is a chamferboard house on a stone foundation with a corrugated iron roof, built in 1861 with subsequent additions to the rear, front and western elevations. The house sits on its eastern alignment and is surrounded by lush subtropical gardens on the north, south and west. Glimpses of the house from the street are through formally arranged exotic and native trees. The stone base probably indicates the extent of the original house. Above the stone base are four rooms; two bedrooms, two reception rooms and a central hallway. The ground falls away at the rear of the building forming a room in the stone base, now disused but once the original kitchen. The original cast-iron range remains in the fireplace. A wing projects from the rear of the house along the eastern boundary. It also has a stone base which contains the original laundry with zinc tubs. This wing is further extended by a single storey gable roofed timber structure originally built as a stables and servants accommodation. A narrow gable roofed timber addition, built in the 1930s, extends along the western side of the stone based rear wing. The front facade has been significantly altered, mainly around 1900. It now features a projecting gable roofed room on the eastern side, a classically detailed entry porch in the centre and an attached rotunda with an ogee profiled cupola on the south west corner. These picturesquely arranged elements are connected by an open verandah. Verandahs on the west and north are enclosed. The interior of the house is intact with the exception of the reception rooms and hall which have been remodelled. The complex of corrugated iron roofs articulates separately the mass of buildings constructed over time. The original house has the largest roof, made up of hips and valleys, the rear wings are hipped and gabled and the verandahs are flat or curved skillions. Five brick chimneys stacks of varying sizes and the pointed cupola complete the roofscape. Bryntirion is an intact building that retains its 1860s core and garden setting.  Heritage listing  Bryntirion was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 December 1993 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. As a large villa residence embodying structural and stylistic changes from the 1860s, Bryntirion is important in demonstrating the pattern of changing affluent lifestyle and tastes in Brisbane. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. As one of the few remaining 1860s buildings in Brisbane, and the only example of a house on Wickham Terrace to be in continuous use as a family residence and doctor's surgery, Bryntirion demonstrates aspects of Brisbane's cultural heritage which are now rare. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Bryntirion is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of the layout and planting of a large private garden dating from the late nineteenth century; and of a residence built in the 1860s and extended over time. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Bryntirion is important in exhibiting a range of aesthetic characteristics valued by Brisbane's community, in particular the picturesque composition of the building's architectural elements and the contribution of the established garden to the Wickham Terrace and Burley Street streetscape.

She is known for being a Co-Founder and First Co-President of Columbia College Chicago.  Biography  Ida Morey was born on April 11, 1856 to William and Sarah Morey in Mercer County, Illinois. Later, the family moved to Union Township, Iowa. Her father, originally from Ohio, was a farmer and her mother, originally from New York, was a housewife. She attended the public schools of Chariton, Iowa. On October 4, 1877, she married Heston G. Riley of Ashley, Ohio. He died January 19, 1879. She returned to Iowa to teach and later become principal of the Chariton, Iowa public school that she attended as a youth. She then taught at the State Agricultural College at Ames, Iowa where she met Mary A. Blood in 1887, who had been sent out from the Emerson School of Oratory (now Emerson College) in Boston to teach elocution and expression. Blood urged her to move to Boston and study at the Emerson School where she graduated with a bachelor's degree in Oration in 1889 and a master's degree in Oration in 1890. She then joined Mary Blood in Chicago where the two women established the Columbia School of Oratory (now Columbia College Chicago) in 1890. Anticipating a strong need for public speaking at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, which celebrated the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's arrival in the Americas, Blood and Riley were inspired to open their school in the exposition city, Chicago, and adopt the exposition's name. She served as secretary of the National Association of Elocutionists and was a member of its Board of Directors until her death on March 7, 1901. Funeral services were held at the residence of Helen E. Starrett as both Mary Blood and Ida Riley had been living there. Dr. Frank W. Gunsaulus conducted the services and Mary Blood read selections from the Bible. She is buried next to her husband in Ashley, Ohio.

The cup was to have embedded sensors and the capability of linking to a smartphone to provide its user with nutritional and other data on the beverage in the cup. The designers convinced backers that the Vessyl would help make better decisions about their health and overall consumption. The cup was expected to recharge via inductive charging on a proprietary base station, to be included in the product packaging. Industrial designer Yves B√©har and his design firm Fuseproject were involved in its creation. Originally, the device was expected to ship in \\"Early 2015\\". However, in March 2015, Mark One announced via blog update that the shipping date would slip to \\"Q4 2017\\" once it has reached a satisfactory level of performance.

At the time the company closed its doors, early backers of the Vessyl were left without any formal communication as to the shutdown of the company, with the company no longer responding to inquiries from backers, and backer investment money disappearing along with the company and founder, Justin Lee. As of December 22, 2017, the company's website was operational, though backers could no longer log into their account, and before the month ended the website ceased to function entirely.

In addition to offering refunds, for backers who remained invested and hopeful of receiving their initial Vessyl orders, the designers introduced a secondary product, Pryme Vessyl, released to the public in November 2015 along with the false promise that early supporters who chose to resist requesting a refund on their initial orders could take advantage of a free opt-in program to receive a Pryme Vessyl as a reward for being patient and maintaining their investment with the company.

It was built in the 1860s by Alexander McNab. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  Athol Place was built in the early 1860s soon after Wickham Terrace was opened up for development. The block of three stone terrace houses was built by Alexander McNab, a building contractor, who retained them as rental properties. McNab lived next door in Athol Cottage which has since been demolished. Both properties were named after McNab's home town of Blair Atholl in Scotland. An early tenant was the noted physician Dr Joseph Bancroft who opened consulting rooms there in 1866, shortly after starting his Brisbane practice. Later tenants included McNab's son Alexander, who established the legal firm of Chambers McNab, and Brisbane Girls High School (now Somerville House) which used one residence as a boarding house. In 1916 the property was sold to Patrick Ryan whose family moved into one of the residences. In 1929 the Ryans moved out and converted the property into six flats. They sold Athol Place in 1972 to a firm of engineers who in turn sold it to Drs John Herron and Jon Cohen in 1979. They reinstated the exterior and refurbished the interior of the property, creating the two consulting rooms and a reception area on the ground floor and three flats upstairs.  Description  Athol Place is a row of three Colonial Georgian style terrace houses. Two storey in height, it is built in Brisbane tuff with a corrugated iron roof replacing the original shingles. A timber verandah with cast-iron balustrading extends across the front of the building of the upper level. As with many of its contemporaries, the row appears as a unified building with a single hipped roof. The interior is lined with plaster except for the rear sections which are in tongue and groove timber. The ground floor consists of a central waiting room with doors leading off on either side to doctors' consulting rooms. At the rear of each of these is an examination room which is entered through an archway. French doors open out from the reception and consulting rooms onto a hallway which runs across the width of the building. On the other side of the hall are a kitchen and offices and three stairwells leading to the flats on the first floor. These flats consist of an open kitchen and bathroom area at the top of the stairs, a wide hallway with living room on one side and two bedrooms which open out through French doors onto the front verandah. A sub-floor is created by the fall of the land at the rear of the building forming three rooms and three cellars. Until renovation, the original layout of each terrace house consisted of two ground floor reception rooms, each with a fireplace, and a wing comprising kitchen and service-rooms at the back. A staircase on one side of the front room leads to the upstairs bedrooms.  Heritage listing  Athol Place was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Built soon after the opening up of Wickham Terrace, Athol Place is significant as one of the earliest stone terrace houses with Georgian elements built in Brisbane. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. It is one of the few surviving original residential buildings left along this street, and is indicative of the type of house once common when this was a residential area. Terrace houses, though numerous, were not as common in Brisbane as they were in southern capitals. The demolition of many of their number has increased the rarity of early examples still extant. As most two storey terrace houses in Brisbane were built in brick or timber, the stone construction of Athol Place increases its significance. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is a fine example of its type and contributes to the streetscape of Wickham Terrace including Bryntirion on the adjacent corner of Birley Street. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building is a fine example of its type and contributes to the streetscape of Wickham Terrace including Bryntirion on the adjacent corner of Birley Street. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Athol Place's significance is enhanced by its association with Alexander McNab, the successful early Brisbane developer who built and owned it for many years. This was the residence of his son Alexander, the prominent solicitor, and was at one time the surgery of Dr Joseph Bancroft, the pioneer physician.

Displeased with that situation, he fled from his family by volunteering to serve in World War I. Insurgent Peasant, from the D√≥zsa woodcut series (1928) This proved to be an unfortunate decision, as he was wounded at the front, leaving him with a paralyzed left hand and a lung problem which became tuberculosis. In 1916, he moved to Budapest where he supported himself with a disability pension and, ironically, by doing some carpentry. In 1918, he joined the Hungarian Communist Party and remained a member until 1930, when membership became too dangerous. During this time, he learned to draw and paint at various night schools until 1918, when K√°roly Kernstok agreed to take him as a student, free of charge, at the Nyerges√∫jfalu art colony and taught him copper engraving in addition to painting. Unfortunately, the many changes in government disrupted pension payments and he was forced to return to manual labor, which was increasingly too difficult for him. As a result, he moved to Vienna in 1923, where he was able to find sufficient work doing paintings and etchings and had a successful exhibition at the Weihburg Gallery. He lived there for three years, then returned to Budapest. In 1928, his reputation was secured by a series of twelve woodcuts depicting the peasant revolt of 1514 (led by Gy√∂rgy D√≥zsa), despite having been done at the behest of the Communist Party. After 1930, his style became increasingly personal and eccentric. Tempera was his preferred medium then and his paintings, with subjects from daily life, became larger; almost monumental. He also worked in clay and wood sculpture. He died, aged only forty, after a series of illnesses.

Nelson recorded the song during his stint with Monument Records, and eventually became his only single released by the label. While the release failed to achieve national success, it was well received in Texas. Nelson re- recorded the song and included it in several album releases. Background and recording By early 1964, Nelson left Liberty Records after the release of his debut album, ...And Then I Wrote. At the time, Nelson was approached by Chet Atkins of RCA Records, who talked to him about the possibility of being signed by the label. Ultimately, Nelson decided instead to join Monument Records. The first session with the label, on July 6 produced by Fred Foster resulted in a failure. Foster's initial idea for the three-song session included French horns, trumpets and xylophones. For the following session in the third week of July that produced \\"I Never Cared For You\\", Foster stripped the band down to a guitar, bass, drums and a saxophone. The musicians included classical guitar player David Parker, bassist Bob Moore, drummer Jack Greubel and saxophonist Boots Randolph. During the recording, Moore complained that Nelson broke meter constantly, and that he was impossible to follow. Foster, meanwhile instructed him to stop playing, and told him that he would later overdub the bass. Release and reception Backed with \\"You Left Me (A long Time Ago)\\" on the B-side, \\"I Never Cared For You\\" was released in October 1964. It became the only single that Nelson released on Monument Records. The complex nature of the lyrics at the time did not favor its reception on the Country and Western market. The single flopped on the national market, while it became a local hit in Texas, enjoying major success in Houston. Nelson soon after resumed talks with Chet Atkins, and left Monument to join RCA Records. The song became a recurrent track in Nelson's albums. He released new versions of the song with his albums Me & Paul, A Horse Called Music, Teatro and December Day.

Angered at the renomination of President William Howard Taft over their candidate at the 1912 Republican National Convention, supporters of former President Theodore Roosevelt convened in Chicago and endorsed the formation of a national progressive party. When formally launched later that summer, the new Progressive Party acclaimed Roosevelt as its presidential nominee and Governor Hiram Johnson of California as his vice presidential running mate. Questioned by reporters, Roosevelt said he felt as strong as a \\"bull moose\\". Henceforth known as the \\"Bull Moose Party\\", the Progressives promised to increase federal regulation and protect the welfare of ordinary people. The party was funded by publisher Frank Munsey and its executive secretary George Walbridge Perkins, an employee of banker J. P. Morgan and International Harvester. Perkins blocked an antitrust plank, shocking reformers who thought of Roosevelt as a true trust-buster. The delegates to the convention sang the hymn \\"Onward, Christian Soldiers\\" as their anthem. In a famous acceptance speech, Roosevelt compared the coming presidential campaign to the Battle of Armageddon and stated that the Progressives were going to \\"battle for the Lord.\\" The August convention opened with great enthusiasm. Over 2,000 delegates attended, including many women. In 1912, neither the Republican candidate, President Taft, nor the Democratic nominee Woodrow Wilson, had endorsed women's suffrage on the national level and the famed suffragette and social worker Jane Addams gave a seconding speech for Roosevelt's nomination. Although Roosevelt insisted on excluding African-American Republicans from the South (whom he regarded as a corrupt and ineffective element), he did include black delegates from all other parts of the country,CQG, 1985, pp. 77‚Äì78 and he further alienated white southern supporters on the eve of the election by publicly dining with black people at a Rhode Island hotel. Roosevelt said at the end of his speech \\" We stand at Armageddon, and we battle for the Lord.\\" Candidates gallery Image:Theodore Roosevelt-Pach.jpgFormer President Theodore Roosevelt from New York Image:Hiram Johnson 2.jpgGovernor Hiram Johnson of California The Platform The main work of the convention was the platform, which set forth the new party's appeal to the voters. It was drafted in part by Charles McCarthy, and included a broad range of social and political reforms advocated by progressives. 16-page campaign booklet with party platform of the Progressive Party The platform's main theme was reversing the domination of politics by business interests, which allegedly controlled the Republicans' and Democrats' parties alike. The platform asserted that the first task of the statesmanship of the day was to destroy the invisible Government, and to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics. To that end, the platform called for * strict limits and disclosure requirements on political campaign contributions, * registration of lobbyists, and * recording and publication of congressional committee proceedings. In the social sphere the platform called for * a National Health Service to include all existing government medical agencies; * social insurance, to provide for the elderly, the unemployed, and the disabled; * limited injunctions in strikes; * a minimum wage law for women; * an eight-hour workday; * a federal securities commission; * farm relief; * workers' compensation for work-related injuries; * an inheritance tax, and * a constitutional amendment to allow a federal income tax. The political reforms proposed included * women's suffrage, * direct election of senators, and * primary elections for state and federal nominations. The platform also urged states to adopt measures for \\"direct democracy\\", including * the recall election (citizens may remove an elected official before the end of his term), * the referendum (citizens may decide on a law by popular vote), * the initiative (citizens may propose a law by petition and enact it by popular vote), and * judicial referendum (when a court declares a law unconstitutional the citizens may override that ruling by popular vote). Besides these measures, the platform called for reductions in the tariff, limitations on naval armaments by international agreement and improvements to inland waterways. The biggest controversy at the convention was over the platform section dealing with trusts and monopolies such as Standard Oil. The convention approved a strong \\"trust-busting\\" plank, but Roosevelt had it replaced with language that spoke only of \\"strong National regulation\\" and \\"permanent active [Federal] supervision\\" of major corporations. This retreat shocked reformers like Pinchot, who blamed it on Perkins (a director of U.S. Steel). The result was a deep split in the new party that was never resolved. In general, the platform expressed Roosevelt's \\"New Nationalism\\": a strong government to regulate industry, protect the middle and working classes, and carry on great national projects. This New Nationalism was paternalistic in direct contrast to Wilson's individualistic philosophy of \\"New Freedom\\". Roosevelt also favored a vigorous foreign policy, including strong military power. Though the platform called for limiting naval armaments, it also recommended the construction of two new battleships per year, much to the distress of outright pacifists such as Jane Addams.

It was built from 1860s to 1936. It was also known as Emmanuel College. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 March 2000.  History  St Andrew's War Memorial Hospital Administration Building is a two-storey rendered masonry building, the greater part of which was constructed in 1931 and 1936, and that also encompasses sections of a residence owned by Sir Charles Lilley dating from the late 1860s. From 1912 to 1954, the building was occupied by Emmanuel College, the Presbyterian college of residence of the University of Queensland. When the college relocated to the university's St Lucia campus in 1954, the building became part of St Andrews War Memorial Hospital. Crown land along Leichardt Street and Wickham Terrace was sold from 1856 marking the beginning of the development of Spring Hill, the \\"second northside suburb within the old town boundary of Brisbane\\". The meandering ridge roads of Wickham and Gregory Terrace were cleared of eucalyptus forest and indigenous communities in the late 1850s to 1870s to make way for the residences of the Brisbane elite. One of these was judge and politician, Sir Charles Lilley. Between 1863 and 1889, several parcels of land in the block now bounded by Bradley Street, Boundary Street, Wickham Terrace and North Street were purchased by Lilley or his trustees. An article in The Queenslander, 29 May 1930, claims that Lilley built Jesmond Cottage, a \\"one storeyed stone dwelling with slate roof\\" in Spring Hill around the time he was Queensland Premier in the late 1860s. As his family grew, it is believed that he added a two-storey stone extension and acquired or built an adjacent cottage which was used as accommodation for his sons. Lilley emigrated to Sydney in 1856 but soon moved to Brisbane where he worked in the law and as an editor for the Moreton Bay Courier. In 1858, he married Sarah Jane Jeays, the daughter of Brisbane architect and mayor Joshua Jeays. Lilley's legal and political career advanced during the 1860s and 1870s. In 1860, he was elected a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly for Fortitude Valley and became Attorney-General in Macalister's ministry in 1866 and 1867. He was Premier of Queensland from 1868-1870, appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1879 and received a knighthood in 1881. He is best remembered as a champion of free education as his 1870 Act introduced free primary education in Queensland. Sir Charles Lilley died in 1897, leaving a widow and thirteen children. The site in Spring Hill remained in the hands of his trustees until the death of his son, Edwyn Mitford Lilley in 1911, at which point the land was subdivided and sold. Following the opening of the University of Queensland at Gardens Point in March 1911, Emmanuel College purchased over an acre of land on Wickham Terrace towards the end of the year. Emmanuel College was the Presbyterian Church's residential college and Theological Hall and was one of the first residential colleges to be established, along with St John's and King's Colleges in Kangaroo Point in 1912, Women's College also at Kangaroo Point in 1914 and St Leo's also on Wickham Terrace in 1918. None of these other early college buildings have survived. Emmanuel College, Wickham Terrace, 1930 The Presbyterian College Committee was formed in 1910 and ¬£856 was subscribed towards the costs of buying suitable premises for a college by a large number of Brisbane residents. The decision was made to purchase the former Lilley residence, then being used as a boarding house, and the college opened with five students on 15 May 1912. For twelve years this remained the principal building of the College. Also on the site were a separate kitchen block and three cottages. The cottage on the block of land bordered by Bradley and Boundary Streets was pulled down and the land sold within a few years of the establishment of the College. The timber cottage to the West and facing Wickham Terrace was used as the Principal's residence and demolished in 1936 and another facing Bradley Street provided quarters for the domestic staff. A two-storey fibro-cement building, at the eastern end and perpendicular to the buildings facing Wickham Terrace, was completed in 1923. Initially this building had twelve students' rooms on the top floor and a dining room and billiard room on the first floor with showers and bathrooms in a basement at the north end of the building. In 1927, a three-storey brick building comprising a new dining hall, kitchen and student rooms was completed at a cost of ¬£5000. The old kitchen block was also demolished at this time. In 1931, the stone house was extensively remodelled with the addition of a two- storey cement wing on the eastern side, the rendering of the original stonework and changes to window openings. These alterations were designed by Brisbane architect Douglas Francis Woodcraft Roberts and cost ¬£2750. A western wing was constructed in 1936 to a cost of ¬£6500. The detailing is the similar to the earlier alterations but it is not known whether Roberts was also involved in this extension. After World War Two the University re-located from Garden's Point to St Lucia and Emmanuel College moved to new premises at the same time. Dr Alexander Mayes and wife Thora, 1934 Following World War II, Dr Alexander Mayes became the chairman of the committee of the Presbyterian Church to raise funding for the construction of a war memorial Hospital in Brisbane, built to honour the memories of the Australians who died in the war. Mayes' vision was \\"I see a 350 bed hospital as our goal, covering all major specialties, with excellent diagnostic facilities and operating theatres\\". In 1954, the old Emmanuel College was purchased by the Presbyterian Church of Queensland for the establishment of the hospital. In May 1958, the St Andrew's War Memorial Hospital opened with a surgical ward, medical ward and a small children's ward. The church bought most of the remaining land on the block bounded by Wickham Terrace, Boundary, North and Bradley Streets during the 1950s and 1960s and the hospital has continued to develop the site in succeeding decades. The main building of the former Emmanuel College has become the front of the hospital and has been used variously for administrative purposes, nurses' accommodation and the children's ward. The building is currently used as offices by the hospital administration. Mayes served as chairman of the board of governors of the hospital for many years. The hospital had an annual fundraising Scottish fair at Brisbane City Hall each year for which Mayes cooked haggis.  Description  St Andrew's War Memorial Hospital Administration Block is a two-storey, rendered masonry building located on Wickham Terrace, opposite Albert Park. A brick retaining wall with two entrances fronts Wickham Terrace, together with a small garden area with two flagpoles. The building is rectangular in form in three sections which present a symmetrical facade to the street. A central section with a pyramidal roof of corrugated steel is flanked by two wings with hip roofs clad in half-round, terracotta tiles. The roofs have deep, boxed eaves with decorative brackets and timber panelled soffit. The lower section of the ground floor is strongly expressed as a base with a rusticated ashlar-like finish to the render. The upper part of the facade is subdivided by a string course at the sill level of the upper floor windows. The exterior of the building features regularly placed rectangular windows, taller on the ground floor and smaller at the upper level with rectangular moulded panels between them. A number of timber, multi-paned casement windows and fanlights survive although many others have been replaced with aluminium framed windows in order to accommodate air conditioners. The main entrance is located to one side of the central section and has a concrete awning with recent automatic door. An ornate, arched doorway recessed into the wall is found at the western end of the Wickham Terrace facade. The door itself has five raised horizontal timber panels with an arched timber fanlight and is richly ornamented with a cartouche above the fanlight. At the rear of the building, evidence of the 1860s house is apparent. The central section is painted sandstone ashlar with several original window openings and a sandstone chimney. In the interior of this section some of the planning of the former residence is discernible and several door openings, mouldings and sections of timber floor remain. The chimney-breast can be seen at both ground and first floor levels and an early dog-leg staircase with balustrade and curved handrail remain. This section of the building has been altered over time. Many of the rooms have decorated plaster ceilings and deep cornices with Art Nouveau inspired ornamentation. The front entrance to the building opens into a hallway space and reception area that has a recent, low ceiling of acoustic tiles and a timber reception desk. Central hallways run from the entry area through both the western and eastern wings. On both levels of these wings the planning is essentially that of the former Emmanuel College with rows of equal-sized, small rooms located either side of the hallway. Most of these have decorative plaster ceilings and cornices. The far western end of the building departs from this pattern. On the ground floor, a board room is located in the north-western corner, the room has been recently decorated and has padded wall panelling up to picture rail height. A dog-leg staircase is located outside the board room and has curvilinear, wrought iron balusters and a curved timber handrail. At the top of this staircase is an entrance doorway to a suite of rooms, articulated as a separate apartment. The entrance door has the stylised appearance of an external door with large hammered-finish, decorative copper hinges, leadlight window and wrought iron door knocker and peephole. A small vestibule is separated from the main rooms of the apartment by a pair of swinging leadlight doors with an Art Deco influence. The main two rooms are panelled in two toned timber with a plate rail and highly decorative ceiling edges and cornice. A recent partition has been inserted into this area dividing it into three small rooms. A brick fireplace is located in the north- west corner. The other two rooms of the apartment are finished in smooth render with decorative ceilings. A bathroom is located at the end of the hall at the west end of the building and appears to have been part of the apartment. The walls are tiled in white, oblong ceramic tiles with a black tiled edge and a random placement of richly coloured Art Deco style tiles. The floor is finished in black and white tiles with a Greek key patterned edge.

The western tower was added during the 15th century. During the 15th century a church porch was also added to the church, but this was torn down during a renovation of the church in 1838. The construction material of the church is whitewashed fieldstone, while the corners and other details are made of sandstone. The windows date from the 1870s, when the considerably smaller, medieval windows were replaced. Internally, the ceiling is supported by medieval vaulting which has been heavily restored during the 19th century.

It consists of a Red dwarf star with 20-30% the mass of the Sun, and a White dwarf star roughly 50% the mass of the sun. The two components orbit each other in a tight orbit only 0.11 astronomical units from each other, with an orbital period of only 14.71 days. Due to their small separation, the two objects have never been visually resolved and are merely predicted from the radial velocity changes of GJ 3991 A, making the system a spectroscopic binary. White dwarf GJ 3991 B was first identified in 1997 by astronomers I. N. Reid and J. E. Gizis through significant radial velocity variations visible through GJ 3991 A, although were unable to identify the nature of the secondary object. In 1998, another group of astronomers was able to determine the secondary as a cold white dwarf star, the compact remnant that remains after a low-mass star such as our Sun is no longer able to fuse elements for energy. GJ 3991 B is the 9th nearest white dwarf, after Sirius B, Procyon B, Van Maanen 2, LP 145-141, 40 Eridani B, Stein 2051 B, G 240-72, and Gliese 223.2. Among these, GJ 3991 B is not only the coldest, but the only one in a short-period orbit with another star. GJ 3991 B is probably over 6 billion years old, making it the oldest among these objects as well. It is unknown exactly how GJ 3991 A and B are in such a tight orbit, as normally an object massive enough to create GJ 3991 B so early in the universe's history would destroy any objects orbiting less than 1-2 AU from it. GJ 3991 A, however, orbits only 0.11 AU from the white dwarf. It is possible that it migrated inwards after GJ 3991 B's red giant phase from a much further orbit.

This synergistic academic-community partnership is led by XinQi Dong MD, MPH, at Rutgers University, Melissa A Simon, MD, MPH, Esther Wong, ACSW, Bernarda Wong, ACSW, and utilizes a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach. The PINE Study is an extensive study that examines the general health and quality of life of Chinese elderly in the Chicago metropolitan area‚Äìthe largest cohort of Chinese elderly ever assembled for epidemiological research in Western countries. The image and acronym \\"PINE\\" was used as a suitable name for the study as in Chinese culture, it symbolizes longevity, resilience, respect and successful aging, which is parallel to the research objectives. Between 2011 and 2013, 3,159 face-to-face interviews were conducted with elderly living in the community, ages ranging from 60 to 105. Each participant‚Äôs interview was personalized according to the languages or dialects they preferred, such as English, Cantonese, Taishanese, Mandarin or Teochew. Data were assembled using a web-based program application which had English, Chinese traditional and simplified characters. Background =Overall Chinese population= The Chinese constitutes 56 different ethnicity, with 53 language dialects, 21 of which possessed their own written scripts. =Chinese population in United States= Asian American population, including those who are of mixed race, is estimated to be 18.2 million in 2010; those who identify only as Asian is estimated to total 14.7 million, approximately 4.8 percent of the population. Census BureauExternal Web Site Icon anticipates that there will be more than 40.6 million Asians present in the United States, comprising 9.2 percent of the total U.S. population by the year of 2050. Amongst the Asian population, Chinese population (except Taiwanese descent) is one of the largest Asian groups in the United States in 2011, constituting 4 million people. The distribution of Chinese American population was found to be mostly in California (1,122,187, 40 percent), New York (451,859 16 percent), Hawaii (170,803), Texas (121,588), New Jersey (110, 263) and Massachusetts (92,380) with Illinois (86,095).Baylor Ronald H. (2011). \\"Multicultural America: An Encyclopedia of Newest Americans, Volume 1\\", Appendix 1 Table 49. Greenwood. . Retrieved on Jan 22, 2015 Chicago is among the top 10 cities where Chinese Americans are concentrated. In most major US Cities, Chinese communities are mostly dominant in Chinatowns, usually called as \\"Tang2 Ren2 Jie1\\" in Mandarin and \\"Tong yan gai\\" in Cantonese. One of the largest Chinatowns in North American is Chinatown, Chicago, where first few Chinese immigrants settled when they arrived in Chicago in the 1870s. Chicago Chinatown Gate at Night Among 56 ethnic groups in China, Mandarin is mostly used. In Chicago, Mandarin, in addition to Cantonese, Taishanese and Teochew dialects are very commonly used. =Chinese population in Chicago= In 1910, Chinese population in Chicago increased to 1,000. 2 years later, increasing living costs and racial discrimination led most Chinese towards the south side of Chicago, leading to the establishment of the current Chinatown near Wentworth and Cermak. After the 1943 Chinese Exclusion Act repeal, a second wave of immigration occurred due to economic opportunities and family reunion. The revolution that occurred in mainland China in 1952 and the Tiannanmen Square protests in 1989 further increased the settlement of Chinese in the US. The Chinese population from Hong Kong, Taiwan and China further increased with the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act in addition to the increase the visa quota by 40% in 1990. In the 1970s, Chicago has the 4th largest Chinese population in the US and by 2012, Census 2010 data recorded 42,060 Chinese in Chicago. After the conclusion of Vietnam war in 1975, a large number of ethnic Chinese from Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand and Laos settled at uptown Argyle. In Illinois, Chinese community is growing rapidly and increased 35.4% between year 2000 to 2010. This rate is much faster than the African Americans(decreased 1%), Hispanic (increased 33%) and White(decreased 3%) population. Similar trends are seen in Cook County. For the past 10 years, the Chinese population has experienced an increase of 30% in Cook County in contrast to the declining total population. Chicago also experienced a similar pattern; Chinese population increased by 35.7% whereas the overall population decreased by 7%. =Project goal= With rapidly increasing global aging population, it is estimated that China's elderly population aged over 60 will hit 360 million by 2030. Concurrently, it is conceived that between 2012 and 2050, United States will also experience considerable growth in its older population, from 43.1million to 83.7 million, due to the baby boomers. Amongst the Asian subpopulation, the Chinese American was found to be one of the oldest, largest and the most rapid expanding society. Furthermore, they are also growing rapidly with a growth rate of almost four times higher than of overall U.S. older adult population from 2000 to 2010. Despite national statistics reports where U.S. Chinese older adults possess a longer life expectancy as compared to the general population, the initial phase of PINE Study discovered that elderly may not be enjoying the best quality of life. By shedding light on the health and well-being of Chicago Chinese older adults, the goal is to improve the health and quality of life of the Chinese aging population through education, research, advocacy, policy and sustainable community engagement in the Chicago area, and beyond. Methods The PINE Report =Community-based participatory research= PINE Study team executed a community-based participatory research approach in order to assess Chicago Chinese population's health needs, congruent to social, cultural and linguistic backgroupd. CBPR was the foundation to promote Chinese community health. This research design uses exhaustive health inquiry for education, empowerment and affecting sustainable social change, and engagement the participation of community members affected by health issues. For the last decade, this partnership between academic and community centers has been catered to improve the Chicago‚Äôs Chinese population's quality of life. =Data collection= Chinese elderly older than 60 in the Chicago metropolitan area were invited to participate in the study. Participants have been contacted in community settings, such as community-based organizations, social services agencies, churches, educational and outreach activities, senior apartments, newsletters and advertisements in community centers, and also by word of mouth. Multicultural and multilingual interviewers were trained to conduct in- home interviews face-to-face with participants in the language or dialect they are more comfortable with, which are predominantly Cantonese, Taishanese, English, Mandarin and Teochew dialects. During the 2011-2013 period, over 3,000 interviews were conducted. Questions were selected from scales that were validated in social science and public health research, translated into Chinese (if Chinese version was not available) and translated it back to English. The survey questionnaires were further inspected by investigator to ensure content and validity. Data were then collected using state-of-science web-based programthat recorded in English, Chinese traditional and simplified characters. This technological platform minimized any information that may be \\"lost in translation\\", increasing of the data collected. Partners =Academic partners= Rush Institute for Healthy Aging (RIHA) RIHA was formed in 1990 with the goal to better understand community health through rigorous research. Through the years, RIHA has participated in 50 research projects, with over 300 studies, providing knowledge and information about the community in regards to health disparities, cognitive and physical function, quality of life, psychosocial and other issues. =Community organizations= *Chinese American Service League (CASL) *Xilin Asian Community Center *Midwest Asian Health Association (MAHA) =Community Advisory Board= Role The Chinese Community Advisory Board was created to better understanding of needs, and represent the diverse population of Chinese population in Chicago. The Board has played a role in providing overall guidance and advice to the PINE Study, ranging from project conceptualization and preparation, survey implementation, recruitment and finding dissemination. The members are composed of community leaders and representatives from a variety of organizations and disciplines who have frequent interactions with the elderly population and adept in their own fields. Board meetings are held every 1‚Äì2 months with continuous feedback to ensure community steady support and to refine project goals and procedures. =Funding= The PINE Study is funded by the National Institutes of Health and is consistent with NIH's goal of improving health and aging and reducing health disparities in all racial/ethnic groups. Data and findings =Demographic profile= * The average age of participants was 73 years old with 59% of women. 58% of the elderly are married while 22% of them live alone. * Despite elderly in this sample population lived in the US on average for 21 years, 76% of them still exclusively read or speak Chinese, 91% of them socialize with only Chinese people, and 89% have only Chinese friends. * Elderly in this study have lower education and are more likely to be living with significant financial hardships as compared to national estimates of all US elderly. 86% of them live below the poverty line. * 36% of the participants consider religion to be important part of their lives with 54% of them performed religious services at home in the last year when we interviewed them. =Health= *The three most common diseases found amongst Chinese population were hypertension (56%), hypercholesterolemia (49%) and osteoarthritis (39%). These levels were similar and slightly higher than US National estimates. *The leading causes of mortality were heart disease (25%), cancer (23%) and stroke. *8% of study participants reported limitation of at least one aspect of Activities of Daily Living (ADL), predominantly walking and bathing. *51% of participants reported at least one limitation of Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), predominantly shopping, doing housework and laundry. =Healthcare utilization= * Chinese elderly uninsured rate is 5 times higher than national estimate. At time of interview, 24% of elderly do not have insurance. * Chinese elderly are found to not receive lesser preventive healthcare as compared to the national estimate, with 28% receiving a colonoscopy and 35% receiving a mammogram in the last two years. * Traditional Chinese Medicine is used commonly by 76% of participants who reported the use of traditional health remedies in the past year. =Mental health= * Mental health is a significant health burden in Chinese elderly population with an alarmingly high amount of elderly experiencing various form of psychological distress. 74% of elderly report life stress, 66% experience anxiety symptoms and 55% of elderly reports depressive symptoms. * Suicidal ideation and attempts are disproportionately prevalent with 3.7% of Chinese elderly over the age of 60 report suicidal thoughts in a year as compared to 2.3% of US older adults aged 50 and over. 9.4% of them had suicidal thoughts at some point during their lifetime, with 2 out of 1000 participants attempted suicide in the past year. Lifetime suicide attempts were prevalent at 9 out of 1000. =Elder abuse= * Elder abuse is an alarming health issue that was faced by Chinese elderly, with 24% experienced some form of abuse, predominantly psychological abuse (10%) and financial exploitation (10%). * 32% of elderly have also experience other forms of violence before they turned 60, including child abuse and domestic partner violence. =Social well-being= * The Chinese elder's social networks tend to center around family than friends, with 71% of elderly participants who identifies more than 4 close family members. On the other hand, 14% of participants report not having any friends. * It was found that elderly perceive social support more from family members (90%) than friends (70%) and depend on family's support (90%) than friends (60%). * Chinese elderly continue to expect the value filial piety, which is a culturally critical factor that expects children's caregiving obligations. This expectation is mainly placed upon the emotional aspect of care such as respect (90%) which is twice the expectation of instrumental care like financial support (43%). * Chinese elderly exhibit a high sense of belonging in the community where they reside and the feeling that the neighborhood is a good place to live in and feel right at home in the community they are in.  Publications  The data from the PINE study was used to publish more than hundreds of research papers by professionals, from various academic fields, across the states and countries. In 2014, special issues for the PINE study were published by the Journal of Gerontology Series A and AIMS Medical Science, and in 2017, by the Journal of Gerontology Series A. Implications Data collected from the PINE Study shows that there are many concerns with health disparity issues that are found in this rapidly expanding aging US community. At present, there are very few services that cater to the need of Chinese older adults and their families, with a lack workforce able to provide appropriate care, taking into consideration their linguistic and cultural needs. This demonstrates the need for increased social and health care services in the interest of this vulnerable population. A multi- disciplinary partnership is sought to provide them with a much needed disease prevention, intervention and support strategies for successful aging. Future directions =Longitudinally= Currently, the study has completed the third wave of data collection, and is in PINE phase 4.0, where the study team follows up on the Chinese elderly to examine the health status changes over time in order to better understand the risk and protective factors associated with health disparities. =Additional studies= Patient navigation program This project targets low-income women and to guide navigation around the U.S. healthcare and preventive care systems, in attempt to eliminate access barriers in addition to provide early intervention and prevention measures to promote healthy and successful aging.  Promoting Social and Emotional Well-Being in the Chinese Community  This program aimed to lower rates of mental distress and promote mental well-being of U.S. Chinese adults through empowering education, referral to treatment, care coordination, and behavioral activation by Community Health Workers (CHWs). Each participant received personalized intervention, which help him/ her cope with emotions. Focus group discussions Focus groups discussions examine key issues, such as mental health, cancer and intergenerational relationships that Chinese elderly face, via in-depth in person or interactive group interviews, where participants talk freely about the discussed topics. =Data sharing= As described in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Data Sharing Policy, data sharing encourages the use of exclusive data, advocates quality collaborations that across institutions, and expedite rapid translation of research data into publicly accessible knowledge Collaborative research effort through data sharing is critical to the success of the ongoing effort promote health and well-being among Chinese elderly.

History The station was opened by the Highland Railway in 1884 and had a short life with services being suspended during World War I on 9 August 1915 and the rails south of Buckie removed, although it was hoped to restart services. The line remained closed in 1923, when the Highland Railway was absorbed by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). After this the track was relaid, but services were not restarted and the track removed again in 1937.Geograph The nearby Aultmore became the terminus of a goods spur from Keith and continued in use until 1966. Work had begun on the Keith to Portessie line of the Highland Railway on 7 November 1882. Wartime economies led to closure of the line on 9 August 1915 and in 1917 the track between Aultmore (towards Keith) and Portessie was requisitioned by the Admiralty. The Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) re-opened the north and south sections of line by 1919, but the Aultmore to Portessie section passing through Enzie, Drybridge and Rathven was never re-opened and the track was again removed in 1937. =Infrastructure= The station had a single platform, a signal box and a goods shed with a stationmaster's house nearby.

This was to facilitate a possible reconciliation. Five delegates from each convention met to negotiate. The Progressives wanted reunification, but with Roosevelt as the Republican presidential nominee, which the Republicans adamantly opposed. Meanwhile, Charles Evans Hughes, a moderate progressive, became the front-runner at the Republican convention, though opposed by many conservatives. The Progressives suggested Hughes as a compromise candidate. Then Roosevelt sent a message proposing conservative Senator Henry Cabot Lodge. As a result, the Progressives immediately nominated Roosevelt again, with Louisiana businessman John M. Parker as the Vice Presidential nominee. Parker had run for governor as a Progressive early in 1916. (The Republican Party was deeply unpopular in Louisiana.) Parker got a respectable 37% of the vote. He was the only Progressive to run for governor that year.CQG, 1985, p. 503 Others suggested for the Vice-Presidency were California Governor and the 1912 Vice- Presidential nominee Hiram Johnson, and Chairman of the Party Convention Raymond Robins, but both withdrew their names in favor of Parker. However, Roosevelt later telegraphed the convention and declared that he could not accept their nomination and would be endorsing Republican nominee Charles Hughes for the Presidency. Confusion and collapse With Roosevelt refusing to be their candidate, the Progressive Party quickly fell into disarray; there was a temporary shout led by former Congressman Victor Murdock of Kansas for a ticket consisting of three-time Democratic nominee William Jennings Bryan and industrialist Henry Ford but it amounted to little. Some like National Committeeman Harold L. Ickes refused to consider endorsing Hughes, and there was some talk of nominating another for the Presidency in Roosevelt's stead, such as Hiram Johnson or Gifford Pinchot. However those discussed refused to consider the notion, and by this point some leaders like Henry Justin Allen had started to follow Roosevelt's lead and endorsed the Republican ticket, and various state parties such as those in Iowa and Maine began to disband. Finally, when the Progressive Party National Committee met in Chicago on June 26, those in attendance begrudgingly endorsed Hughes; even those like Ickes who had vehemently refused to consider granting an endorsement to Hughes began to recognize that without Roosevelt the party had no electoral staying power. There had been a weak attempt to replace Roosevelt on the ticket with the former Kansas Congressman Victor Murdock, but the motion was defeated 31 to 15. =Candidates gallery= File:T Roosevelt.jpgFormer President Theodore Roosevelt of New York (Refused nomination) File:VictorMurdock.jpgFormer Congressman Victor Murdock of Kansas (Not formally nominated) File:Hiram Johnson.jpgGovernor Hiram Johnson of California (Declined interest) File:Gifford Pinchot 3c03915u.jpgFormer Chief of the Forest Service Gifford Pinchot of Pennsylvania (Declined interest) Most of its members would return to the Republican Party, although a substantial minority supported Wilson for his efforts in keeping the United States out of World War I. Roosevelt had turned down the Progressive nomination for both personal and political reasons; he had become convinced that running for president on a third-party ticket again would merely give the election to the Democrats, a result he loathed to make possible, since he had developed a strong dislike for President Wilson. He also believed Wilson was allowing Germany and other warring nations in Europe to \\"bully\\" and intimidate the United States.

Demography  According to the 1998 census, Chakwal is one of the most rural districts of Punjab. Animals kept as a source of livelihood Nara Mughlan is a typical rural habitation with limited social/educational facilities. Majority of the people either join the defense/police force or go abroad in search of livelihood to USA/UK. People are predominantly divided on the political front. Some support the Muslim League, some the Peoples Party and some the Tehreek-e-Insaf.

The menhir stands in a field next to Les Paysans road in Guernsey. The granite block is 3.5m tall and extends a further metre below the ground.

After a competition with Defender and Courageous, Liberty was selected as the defender.https://web.archive.org/web/20130103075233/http://www.ali6.com/coppa_america1983.htm She lost to Australia II by 3‚Äì4 in the America's Cup.https://web.archive.org/web/20130103075233/http://www.ali6.com/coppa_america1983.htm  Background  Following the 1980 America's Cup where Freedom defeated Australia, the Freedom ‚Äô83 Defence Syndicate, whose fundraising was run through the Maritime College at the Fort Schuyler Foundation, made the decision to commission two new 12 metre yachts for the 1983 defence. Dennis Conner asked the designers to take risks so that the new boat would not simply be a refined version of Freedom, rather a new design that broke through her.Rousmaniere, John (1983). The America's Cup 1851 ‚Äì 1983. London: Pelham Books. p. 144. The first boat, Spirit of America (US-34), was designed by Bill Langan from Sparkman & Stephens. Langan described it as a \\"large, light twelve.\\"Rousmaniere, John (1983). The America's Cup 1851 ‚Äì 1983. London: Pelham Books. p. 146. The second boat, Magic (US-38), was designed by Johan Valentijn. Valentijn sought to build a small, light displacement 12 metre and Magic was several feet shorter than Spirit of America and displaced a mere 45,000 pounds (20.4 metric tonnes) ‚Äì about three-quarters of most contemporary 12 metres. Both Spirit of America and Magic were commissioned at Fort Schuyler, New York, on 17 April 1982.Rousmaniere, John (1983). The America's Cup 1851 ‚Äì 1983. London: Pelham Books. p. 146. Both boats, however, were failures. Despite the best efforts of the designers with input from computers, wind tunnels and test tanks, Freedom dominated its new stablemates: Magic was uncompetitive in strong wind and Spirit of America needed major modifications if were to become competitive. On 8 September 1982, Dennis Conner announced that Magic would be sold and that the proceeds would be used to design a third boat for the Freedom ‚Äô83 syndicate.Rousmaniere, John (1983). The America's Cup 1851 ‚Äì 1983. London: Pelham Books. p.146-7. Design and construction The initial proposal for the third boat was that Sparkman & Stephens and Johan Valentijn would collaborate to design a refined version of Freedom. This idea was eventually abandoned and ultimately Valentijn was asked to design the third boat himself with the input of Halsey Herreshoff ‚Äì Conner‚Äôs navigator and a designer in his own right.Rousmaniere, John (1983). The America's Cup 1851 ‚Äì 1983. London: Pelham Books. p. 148. Liberty was built by Newport Offshore and was delivered to the Freedom ‚Äô83 Syndicate in January 1983. Early results were mixed, but she was a clear improvement over Spirit of America and the Sparkman and Stephens‚Äô boat was retired.Rousmaniere, John (1983). The America's Cup 1851 ‚Äì 1983. London: Pelham Books. p. 149. By early spring 1983, it was clear some modifications were needed to improve Liberty‚Äôs performance. In particular, its seaway motion needed to be steadied and, in the process, make its performance in heavy winds comparable to Freedom‚Äôs. Three feet were cut from the boat‚Äôs stern and both the keel and rig were moved forward.Rousmaniere, John (1983). The America's Cup 1851 ‚Äì 1983. London: Pelham Books. p. 149. The alterations worked. Just before the defender races began, Conner announced that Liberty would be the boat he would be sailing on behalf of the Freedom ‚Äô83 syndicate.Rousmaniere, John (1983). The America's Cup 1851 ‚Äì 1983. London: Pelham Books. p. 150. Performance Despite being the first US boat to lose the America‚Äôs Cup, Liberty was not a bad design or poorly performing yacht. It clearly had the performance to be selected as the US defender having comprehensively beaten Courageous (US-26). In doing so, Liberty demonstrated a versatile performance in winds ranging from seven to 17 knots.Stannard, Bruce (1983). The Triumph of Australia II. Sydney: Lansdowne. p. 67. Against Australia II, a genuine ‚Äòbreak-through‚Äô design, Liberty won three races and arguably should have won the series but for two events. Firstly, just prior to the crucial fifth race, when Liberty was leading Australia II by 3‚Äì1 and needed only one more race to win the cup, the US boat broke its jumper struts close to the top of the mast. Although repairs were made, they weren‚Äôt totally effective and on the first leg of the race, the port jumper strut again collapsed disadvantaging the boat. Australia II went on to win the fifth race by 1:47 secs.Stannard, Bruce (1983). The Triumph of Australia II. Sydney: Lansdowne. pp. 110‚Äì111. Secondly, Liberty was 57 seconds ahead at the start of the fifth leg on the final race. Conner‚Äôs tactical mistake of not covering Australia II on the final downwind run allowed Australia II to overtake the US boat and eventually win the race and the America‚Äôs Cup.Stannard, Bruce (1983). The Triumph of Australia II. Sydney: Lansdowne. p. 120. Two final points that should be made are that of Liberty‚Äôs rating certificates, and the psychology between the Australia II and Liberty crews ‚Äì in particular that of Dennis Conner. Firstly, Liberty had three rating certificates: one for light, medium and heavy wind. That is, the Liberty camp could change the ballast and sail area depending on the conditions. Prior to the seventh race, the Liberty crew did just that, lifting ballast from the boat and increasing its sail area. John Bertrand, helmsman of Australia II, admitted that in that final race: ‚Äúthe ballasting challenges they had made to Liberty ‚Äì adding more sail area and taking weight out of the boat ‚Äì sped her up remarkably‚Ä¶ she had a little bit more speed on us and all of a sudden, we were in trouble.‚Äù‚ÄúAussie Assault‚Äù Documentary film, Sportsmaster Programs, 1983 Secondly, Conner did appear to be labouring under the psychological weight of Australia II 's excellent performance and the mystery of the winged keel. It seems that he was convinced Liberty was the slower boat and this almost certainly influenced his tactical decisions ‚Äì perhaps even the decision not to cover Australia II on the fifth leg of the final race. During an interview following Liberty‚Äôs comprehensive 3:25 secs loss in the sixth race, he said: \\"yes we‚Äôve made mistakes, I think that relative to the potential of our yacht we‚Äôve gotten a fair bit out of it this series and we‚Äôre pleased.‚Äù (Author‚Äôs emphasis)‚ÄúAussie Assault‚Äù Documentary film, Sportsmaster Programs, 1983 Fate Liberty‚Äôs ultimate fate remains unknown. During 1986‚Äì1988, the boat was the property of Sail America Foundation. Its home port was San Diego, California, and it served as a trial-horse to Stars & Stripes '87. During 1988‚Äì1989 it was transferred to the America‚Äôs Cup Organizing Committee also in San Diego.‚Äúhttp://www.shipstamps.co.uk/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t;=14085‚Äù The evidence then indicates it was sold to a Japanese owner in 1989.‚Äúhttp://www.americas-cup- history.at/english/us40%20libertyhtm‚Äùhttps://www.facebook.com/499298716846647/photos/o.137323756429708/739852529457930/?type=3 Unsubstantiated reports indicate that it sank off the coast of Kobe, Japan, in that year or 1991.‚Äúhttps://www.facebook.com/12MetreLiberty/info?tab=page_info‚Äù References Category:12-metre class yachts Category:America's Cup defenders Category:1980s sailing yachts Category:Sailing yachts built in the United States Category:Sailing yachts of the United States Category:1983 America's Cup ","title":"Liberty (yacht)"},{"id":"45170041","text":"A Romantic Adventuress is a 1920 American silent drama film directed by Harley Knoles and written by Charles Belmont Davis and Rosina Henley.

Woolley, a courier and bodyguard for polygamous leaders of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), who was excommunicated in 1924. History The LDS Church openly practiced plural marriage from 1852 and went through a series of legal battles with the U.S. government, and eventually ended the practice in 1890. Sometime before 1920, Woolley taught that LDS Church President John Taylor had set apart five men, including himself and his father John W. Woolley, to ensure that the practice of polygamy would continue into perpetuity even if abandoned by the church. Taylor's alleged action came shortly after the 1886 Revelation on the subject of polygamy. Between 1929 and 1933, Woolley extended the same supposed apostolic authority that Taylor granted to him, to a seven-man Council of Friends. Following the death of Woolley in September 1934, and of his Second Elder J. Leslie Broadbent six months later, the leadership of the Group fell to John Y. Barlow. In May 1935, Barlow and his fellow Friends sent a handful of followers to the small ranching town of Short Creek in the Arizona Strip (now Colorado City, Arizona, and Hildale, Utah), with the express purpose of building \\"a branch of the Kingdom of God.\\"Diary of Joseph Lyman Jessop, vols. 1-3 (privately published, 2000). Barlow believed that the isolated Creek could provide a place of refuge for those engaging in the covert practice of polygamy, a felony; within a month, the town's population more than doubled. After the failure of an attempted communal United Trust in 1935, the Group, particularly Apostle Rulon Jeffs, an accountant, worked to develop the United Effort Plan (UEP), intended to prepare the way for the collectivist United Order described by Mormon founder Joseph Smith. The UEP was incorporated on November 9, 1942. By 1944, the illicit activities of the Group, now boasting about 2,500 members, had come to the attention of LDS Church President Heber J. Grant, who agreed to cooperate with state and federal authorities in a multi-state raid intended to wipe out polygamy. In the 1944 raid, forty-six Community adults were accused of \\"unlawful cohabitation\\" and similar crimes, of whom fifteen ultimately received state prison sentences and nine federal prison sentences, with two, Charles Zitting and David Darger, receiving both. Schoolhouse of the Community and site of the 1953 Short Creek Raid. The group was notorious for the practice of polygamy due to media coverage during the Short Creek raids of 1945 and 1953. The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) later developed in the same geographical region and changed the name of the town to Colorado City and Hildale to eliminate any ties to the Short Creek raids. Additions were made to Woolley's Council of Friends as time went on and former members died or left the movement. Leroy S. Johnson and Rulon Jeffs, future leaders of the FLDS Church, were ordained by John Y. Barlow in the 1940s, while Joseph Musser's ordination of Rulon C. Allred in 1952 caused a division in the community and led to the creation of the Apostolic United Brethren (AUB). Today, the AUB continues to be led by a Priesthood Council, while the FLDS Church transitioned to autocratic \\"One Man Rule\\" by a single prophet in the 1980s. Other fundamentalist groups led by a Priesthood Council include the Centennial Park group, the Latter Day Church of Christ (Kingston Group), and the Righteous Branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Peterson Group). Priesthood authority The authority of the Council of Friends pertained to the Priesthood and not to the church, early Mormon fundamentalists, most of whom had been excommunicated from the LDS Church, felt that its existence gave them the right to continue solemnizing plural marriages even after LDS Church President Wilford Woodruff's 1890 Manifesto discountenancing the practice. Indeed, Woolley claimed to have been ordained to the Council for precisely that purpose by President John Taylor in 1886, along with his father John W. Woolley and four others. In order to ensure that \\"no year passed by without children being born in the principle of plural marriage.\\" Woolley, who had ostensibly become the last member of the Council after his father's death in December 1928, ordained six more men to the same calling between 1929 and 1933: J. Leslie Broadbent, John Y. Barlow, Joseph White Musser, Charles Zitting, LeGrande Woolley, and Louis A. Kelsch.

Raynova (Bulgarian: –ò–≤–∞–Ω–∫–∞ –ë. –†–∞–π–Ω–æ–≤–∞; born 16 October 1959) is a Bulgarian philosopher, feminist, editor, translator, and publisher. She is full professor of contemporary philosophy at the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and director of the Institute for Axiological Research in Vienna. Her research interests include western philosophy, continental philosophy, phenomenology, hermeneutics, philosophical anthropology, axiology, value theory, feminist philosophy, gender studies, intercultural philosophy, religious studies, translation studies, and the work of Jean-Paul Sartre and Paul Ricoeur. She has translated into Bulgarian Sartre's Being and Nothingness and Ricoeur's The Conflict of Interpretations. She is chief editor of various book series and journals, including the Peter Lang series \\"Philosophie, Ph√§nomenologie und Hermeneutik der Werte\\" (\\"Philosophy, Phenomenology and Value Hermeneutics\\") and Labyrinth: An International Journal of Philosophy, Value Theory and Sociocultural Hermeneutics, as well as program director of the Austrian publishing company Axia Academic Publishers. Education and career Raynova studied Germanic Languages and Literature at the Sorbonne and Philosophy at Humboldt University and Sofia University, where she earned in 1984 her master's degrees in Philosophy and in French Studies. From 1984 to 1989 she was Assistant Professor in French Studies in charge of the Philosophy Translation Program at the Department of Foreign Languages of Sofia University. In 1989 she earned a Ph.D. in Philosophy from the Institute of Philosophy at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, where she became Junior research fellow. The same year she founded the Bulgarian Society for French Philosophy and Culture - Soci√©t√© Bulgare de Philosophie et de Culture de Langue Fran√ßaise. After her habilitation in 1996, she was appointed senior research fellow and became Chair of the Department for Contemporary European Philosophy and Gender Studies and head of the Bulgarian Phenomenological Center. She was scientific secretary of the Institute of Philosophy from 1995 to 1997. After fellowships at Vienna University and the Austrian Academy of Sciences, she became in 1999 co-founder and director of the Institut f√ºr Axiologische Forschungen (Institute of Axiological Research). In 2006 she got a second doctoral title - Dr. phil. - from Vienna University. Since 2009 she has participated in the Austrian academic program \\"University meets Public\\", teaching philosophy courses in different high schools in Vienna. In 2013 she earned the highest doctoral degree - Sc.D., Doctor of Sciences in Philosophy - from the newly founded Institute for the Study of Societies and Knowledge of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, where she was appointed full professor. Work Translations and articles The early writings and research of Raynova had a special impact on Bulgarian philosophy and culture, as she was the first to introduce contemporary French and German philosophers, unknown at the time in the Bulgarian academia, like Simone Weil, Simone de Beauvoir, Edith Stein, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Paul Ricoeur, and to translate original texts of these and other authors into Bulgarian. She was also the first to open the field of Feminist philosophy in Bulgaria by publishing an extensive essay on Beauvoir in 1988 and organizing ten years later the first conference on Feminist philosophy in Sofia in which took part well known feminists like Alison Jaggar, Herta Nagl-Docekal, Cornelia Klinger, Hedwig Meyer-Wilmes a.o. After the fall of Communism she became chief editor of the book series \\"Philosophers of the 20th Century\\" at the publisher \\"Nauka I Izkustvo\\", and \\"Contemporary Philosophers\\" at EA, where she compiled the translation programs and edited herself some key figures of Western philosophy, including Jean-Paul Sartre, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Paul Ricoeur, Jacques Derrida, Jean Baudrillard, Jean-Francois Lyotard, Richard Rorty a. o. In addition to her Phenomenology courses at Sofia University, she set up in 1995 a seminar and invited lecturer program on \\"Phenomenology and Post-Phenomenology\\" of the Institute of Philosophy, and organized in 2004 the first International Conference on Phenomenology and Hermeneutics at Goethe Institut ‚Äì Sofia. Post-personalism, phenomenology, and comparative hermeneutics Since the beginning of her career, Raynova used the methods of comparative hermeneutics in combination with a new methodological and critical approach that she launched under the neologism of \\"post-personalism.\\" This perspective was elaborated in her first monograph From existential philosophy to post-personalism (1992) in the context of a detailed hermeneutic comparison of French personalism and existential philosophy. She explores in this book the question if Personalism is a form of Existentialism, as claimed Emmanuel Mounier, or, on the contrary, if existential philosophy is a variant of personalism, as asserted Jean Lacroix and Nikolai Berdyaev. By the means of an analysis of their common topics Raynova shows their specific methodological differences and issues, hence she offers more exact definitions of both currents as well as a new methodology enabling clearer distinctions between the different contemporary philosophical schools. Trying to overcome some dilemmas of contemporary philosophy, she propounds in conclusion \\"post-personalism\\" as a complex methodological alternative based on the following principles: the deconstruction of the conceptions of the personal existence and impersonal being reinterpreted in direction of the Urgrund as a supra-personal ground of being; the existence of a plurality of monadic centers; the personal evolution as a transformation through the free choice of a continuous conversion, i.e. a profound transformation of values and moral attitudes. This methodology is applied in her next book From Husserl to Ricoeur (1993). By retracing the different stages of Husserl's work, which passes from the project of the elaboration of \\"philosophy as science\\" (egology) to philosophy as a \\"general science of mind\\" (science of the life world), Raynova recovers the critical receptions of this projects in the post-husserlian thought and analyses the major transformations of the phenomenological approach to human being - the philosophical anthropology, the phenomenology of life, the fundamental ontology, the existential philosophy, neo-thomism and neo-Protestant phenomenology, French personalism, and hermeneutic phenomenology. Thus she shows how the transfigurations of the phenomenological approach passes from the conception of human being as a philosophical object to the conception of being (where Dasein is the \\"privileged\\" being) as a fundamental question of philosophy, ending in multiple rivalizing interpretations of subjectivity and unveiling the limits of phenomenology. As a possible overcome of this situation Raynova suggests a post-personalist deconstruction of the life world which deconstructs it not as subjectivity but as a center and as a starting point of philosophy. Some of these subjects has been subsequently discussed in interviews with eminent philosophers, published in her book Philosophy at the End of the 20th century (1995), and were later scrutinized in the context of the social and political implications of the phenomenological movement in her book √ätre et √™tre libre: deux passions des philosophes ph√©nom√©nologiques (2010). The post-personalist critical methodology was implemented also in her monograph Jean-Paul Sartre, the philosopher without God (1995) where she proposes a reinterpretation of Sartre's philosophical evolution by revisiting the axiological effects of his radical rejection of the hypothesis about God. The question about God and hence the questions if phenomenology can be elaborated as religious philosophy or only as a hermeneutic philosophy of religion are at the core of Raynova's discussions with Paul Ricoeur in Between the Said and the Unsaid (2009). Since 2000 Ricoeur's philosophy became the main subject-matter of her writings where she argues, in contrast to the mainstream interpretations, that there are some important differences in the perspectives of Ricoeur's early phenomenology and his later philosophical works. Honors and awards In 1983 Raynova became the First Prize in the National Philosophy Competition from the Bulgarian Ministry of Education and the Council of Higher Education. She was granted in 1996 the Paul Celan Fellowship at the Institut f√ºr die Wissenschaften vom Menschen in Vienna. In 1997 she has been Visiting Scholar at Vienna University and from 1998 to 1999 Visiting Fellow at the Austrian Academy of Sciences. For her translations of Jean-Paul Sartre's Being and Nothingness and Paul Ricoeur's The Conflict of Interpretations she was awarded the Bulgarian Union of Translators and the National Publishing Center's Translation Award in the field of Humanities.

The museum is an anchor point on the European Route of Industrial Heritage. History Narvik was founded in 1902 as the railhead of the Ofoten Railway (Ofotbanen) at an ice-free port on the Ofotfjorden to allow the mining corporation LKAB to exports a large supply of iron ore from Kiruna in neighbouring Sweden. LKAB built the Iron Ore Line (Malmbanan) to the Norwegian border. The combined rail line has transported tons of iron ore from Sweden since 1902. Due to the warm currents from the Gulf Stream, the port is usually kept ice-free. The port is also naturally large to hold boats up to long and deep. The building that houses Museum Nord, Narvik was erected in 1902, as the head office of the Norwegian state railway company, Norges statsbaner. It was designed by architect, Paul Due. The museum is situated one kilometre from the harbour and contains models of significant bridges and landing stages. The museum also possesses an archive of 200,000 historic photographs. The museum tells the stories of the building of the Ofoten Railway, Swedish mining company LKAB, development of the ice-free harbour of Narvik and the rapid transformation of the town over the past century.

The mission of The Freshwater Trust is to preserve and restore freshwater ecosystems.  History  The Freshwater Trust was a result of a merger between Oregon Trout and Oregon Water Trust in 2009. Oregon Trout was founded by a group of conservation fly fisherman in 1983. Founded 10 years later in 1993 with the help of Oregon Trout, Oregon Water Trust became the nation's first water trust. In 1991, the organization led a coalition to list several Pacific salmon under the Endangered Species Act. In 1996, they created Salmon Watch, a program to introduce students to the importance of protecting wild fish. In 1998, they led the effort to designate lottery dollars to habitat restoration. In 2007, they began building the StreamBank web platform, an effort to use technology to increase the pace and scale of restoration. They received a patent for StreamBank in 2011, and two years later, they received the U.S. Water Prize for innovation. In 2015, Joe Whitworth, the organization's president, wrote a book documenting the \\"quantified conservation\\" approach that The Freshwater Trust uses to fix rivers. \\"Quantified: Redefining Conservation for the Next Economy\\" was published by Island Press.\\"Quantified: Redefining Conservation for the Next Economy.\\" Island Press. Published September 2015.  Overview  The Freshwater Trust returns degraded streams to healthy conditions. Restoration actions include planting streamside, or riparian, forests to provide shade to a stream and stabilize banks; placing large woody structures instream to provide habitat for spawning and rearing habitat; restoring flow to dewatered streams; and reconnecting streams to closed floodplains. The Freshwater Trust also works with regulated entities to meet regulatory compliance through river restoration. The Freshwater Trust touts an approach called \\"quantified conservation.\\" This is the idea that conservation actions must be linked to positive, quantifiable outcomes for the environment. The organization also uses water quality trading to fix rivers. Water quality trading is a collaborative solution to address water quality and pollutant loads in a watershed. Water quality trading allows permitted point-source dischargers to invest in ‚Äúgreen‚Äù rather than ‚Äúgray‚Äù infrastructure (natural versus built) solutions. The Freshwater Trust assists a point source with designing and implementing trading program and bringing in regulators and non-point sources.Astor Boozer (August 11, 2014) ‚ÄúStates Use Regional Partnership, Innovation to Protect Rivers and a Way of Life.‚Äù USDA Blog.

Her photography includes pictures of environmental protests, such as the nuclear power industry and also of land usage in Australia. She is also credited as the main editor for \\"Critical Distance: Work with Photography/Politics/Writing\\". Career and projects Coventry studied painting from 1960 to 1968, during her first four years (1960-1964), she studied at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) and finished her post-graduate studies at the Slade School of Fine Art in London in 1968. In the 40 years of Coventry's career her work contains consistent themes and her exploration on factors of art, such as space and colouring, with the use of different artistic mediums such as paintings, collages, drawings and photography. The themes of her works would be evoking ideas based on our private expression, through the use of abstraction. Colouring wise, Coventry uses the term \\"acoustic\\" from music and bonds the concept of colouring in paintings, this is done to visualise pitches, keys and tones. Coventry's exploration of space can be evidently seen on her photography and painting projects in the 1970s. In order to create a sense of physical reality and to emphasise character by the use of composition for her photography projects, the size of the installation is proportionally huge. As for her abstract paintings, she uses huge installations in order to enhance how a person would view spacing, lighting and colouring of the paintings. = Here and There: Concerning the Nuclear Power Industry (1977-1978)= Here and There: Concerning the Nuclear Power Industry is a wall panel display which included photocopies of newspaper clippings, photographs printed on gelatin silver materials and notes written in both pencil and fibre tipped pen. The size of the wall panel is about the average person height, which was about four meters long. This was done by Coventry in order for the texts that has been written, can be read by the audience. The criteria for the photographs that were featured in the wall panel, were documentary type photographs, which is the reason why most of the photographs were plain and are classified as \\"what could be seen from outside the fence\\". The environmental message that Coventry wanted to avoid, would be the typical \\"hippy-ish\\" good vs bad, by having contrast of both beautiful nature and devastating technology. In order to avoid this, Coventry uses photos that has been published previously, through pre-existing photographs, it creates a sense that it is the reality that they are currently living in, which makes the message all the more significant as they have already experienced and relate with it. As opposed to photographs that are much more dramatic than the actual problem. Additionally, what makes the artwork unique is Coventry's contribution to the artwork itself, as it is composed of mostly photographs from other people and she only compiled and edited it to a physical medium to be presented to an audience. It consisted of newspaper clippings, photographs of nuclear power plants and handwritten text. The handwritten texts that are found next to various newspaper clippings are written by Coventry. These writings contradicts the statements written by the various newspaper writers, this is done by Coventry to create a juxtaposition effect. It was purchased at 1980. = Whyalla - Not a Document (1977-1981) = Whyalla - Not a Document is a seven part installation, that are supported on cardboard panels, perspex frame and the photographs are printed on silver gelatin process. It features photographs by Coventry, the concept of the photographs revolves about how people would perceive landscape, through the demonstration of the corruption of a land through panoramic photos. The criticism of the damage to the landscape, would be the misusage of the land by major industries, and also how it affects the surrounding areas by formations that takes place on the land based on the consequence of industrial activities. The term \\"Not a document\\" in the title, is used to refer that the photographs shown are not mere representation, but as \\"facts\\". This is Coventry's attempt at exploring the idea of how photographs represent the issue that it's trying to document. It was purchased at 1984. =Critical Distance: Work with Photography/Politics/Writing= Critical Distance: Work with Photography/Politics/Writing is a collection of photography projects concerning environmental and political issues on Australia. The title \\"Critical Distance\\", refers to the relationship the viewers and the photographs of the project (Distance) and also the accuracy of analysis and judgement based on the issues discussed (Critical). Coventry's project on \\"Here and There: Concerning the Nuclear Power Industry\\" is featured in the book, along with fully detailed view of the display. The book was briefly mentioned in Anne-Marie Willis's book on \\"Picturing Australia : A History of Photography\\", as she was discussing fine art photography, she talked about the potential of photography and how it has become a \\"self conscious activity\\" as an art form. Some books including \\"Working Papers on Photography\\" and \\"Halide\\", was described by her as an important and famous examples when it comes to debating the themes of photography in the past years (during the 1980s) Awards and recognitions Over the years Coventry's work has been exhibited in many public and private collections, as well as public museums. Her works are not only presented in Australia but also in England, North America, and New Zealand (Liverpool Street Gallery, New England Regional Art Museum and Center for Contemporary Art, respectively). In Australia alone, she has been featured in galleries and universities from 1978 up until 2009, such as the Australian National University, Tin Sheds Gallery (Faculty of Architecture Design and Planning), University of Sydney, Art Gallery of New South Wales, National Gallery of Victoria (Melbourne), Monash University, Museum of Art Melbourne, Ian Potter Museum of Art, Art Gallery of New South Wales, Watters Gallery, Experimental Art Foundation (Adelaide) and Institute of Modern Art (Brisbane).

Pawlowski was born on March 28, 1973 in Ko≈ºuch√≥w, Poland. Currently he is a street preacher in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. He operates a Christian street outreach organization called Street Church. Pawlowski is also said to advocate anti-LGBT, anti-abortion, and anti-Islam positions. He has spent much time in court due to charges laid against him by the Calgary Police Department in relation to his street preaching and in feeding the homeless of Calgary. In 2014, Pawlowski was fined for attempting to participate in the Calgary Stampede parade with his followers without official permission. On October 24, 2013 he was covered by the National Post stating that Calgary officials have a vendetta and was said to have pulled out a \\"thick sheaf of white papers from his briefcase\\" demonstrating the fact that he has had a lengthy battle for his rights to care for the homeless. For his commitment to his faith and beliefs, Artur has been recognized by various groups. In 2012, for his support of Israel, he received the Honorary Chaplain Position for the Province of Alberta from the prestigious Israeli humanitarian organization The Magen David Adom. He is the first ever to hold such a position for the province of Alberta. As well, on April 28, 2012, he received the 'Free Speech Award' for his seven years of ongoing defense of Canadian constitutional rights and freedoms. This award came from the organization called (PGIB) The Progressive Group for Independent Business of which former-Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper is a member.

Etymology Jilt originally meant \\"harlot\\" or \\"woman who gives hope then dashes it\\"; to jilt meant \\"to deceive (especially after holding out hopes), cheat, trick.\\" In William Wycherley's Love in the Wood (1671), II.i.141, Sir Simon complains of a \\"Mistress of mine...whom I treated to night at the French-house; but as soon as the Jilt had eat up my meat, and drank her two bottles, she run away from me.\\" In the 19th century, George W. Matsell defined \\"jilt\\" as \\"a prostitute who hugs and kisses a countryman while her accomplice robs him.\\" History Ann Street, Boston's red-light district in the 19th century, was lined with \\"jilt shops\\"‚Äîsaloons, dance halls, gambling dens, and brothels‚Äîwhose primary purpose was to lure customers for robbery. An example of a jilt shop in operation is described in an 1881 Boston Globe article. A man named Gideon Burnham entered a small saloon in the North End where, by his account, he attempted to pay for his drink with a $5 bill. The barmaid, Mary McNamara, said she could not make change but could get change across the street. After she left the saloon, Burnham was advised to follow her and retrieve his money before she spent it all on drink. As soon as he left the saloon, the door was locked behind him. Burnham found a police officer and had McNamara arrested for larceny. In court, McNamara and \\"the woman who keeps the jilt shop\\" told a different story, claiming that \\"instead of larceny there was only a breach of an illegal contract\\"; meaning, presumably, that Burnham had paid for sexual services which were not rendered. \\"The court intimated that there was very little difference between stealing and cheating, and preferred to believe the man's story, more particularly as it was the business of such women to cheat people and steal money in the way described.\\" McNamara was fined $20 and costs. In another instance, two female employees of a jilt shop were arrested in 1882 for stealing $250 from the pockets of Charles Tasker, a former North End police officer who \\"ought to have been wise enough to keep out of the snares of strange women.\\" A popular form of entertainment at jilt shops was rat-baiting. In the saloon above the rat-pit, drinks were served by provocatively dressed women who were paid a small fee by the owners, in addition to whatever they collected by various means from the customers.

La Follette with American Federation of Labor president Samuel Gompers during the 1924 election campaign. The nomination of Robert M. La Follette for president took place at a convention held in Cleveland, Ohio from July 4-5, 1924. The convention was called by the Conference for Progressive Political Action (CPPA) and included accredited delegates from national trade unions, state branches of the CPPA, and other political organizations. Members of the Socialist Party of America played a prominent role in the organization of the July convention and the subsequent La Follette presidential campaign; representatives of the Communist Workers Party of America were banned. History =Convention call= On February 11 and 12, 1924, approximately 120 delegates from state branches of the Conference for Progressive Political Action (CPPA), the railroad brotherhoods, and several smaller organizations met at the 3rd Conference of the CPPA in St. Louis, Missouri.Solon DeLeon and Nathan Fine, The American Labor Year Book, 1925: Volume VI. New York: Rand School of Social Science, 1925; pg. 120. This meeting viewed the election results of November 1922 with some satisfaction and reaffirmed the CPPA's stated goal \\"to help nominate and elect to public office only those 'who are pledged to the interests of the producing classes and to the principles of genuine democracy in agriculture, industry, and government.\\" No action was taken for the November 1924 campaign, however, as no candidates had been nominated or political platforms passed by the Democratic or Republican parties (both of which organizations included progressive wings).DeLeon and Fine, The American Labor Year Book, 1925, pg. 121. Nor did sentiment exist for an effort under the auspices of the Socialist Party of America (SPA) or the Farmer-Labor Party (FLP). Instead, the February 1924 CPPA Conference instructed the governing National Committee of the organization to schedule a convention to be held over the Fourth of July holiday \\"for the purpose of taking action on nomination of candidates for the offices of President and Vice-President of the United States, and on other questions that may come before the convention.\\" The National Committee was also instructed to attempt to coordinate its efforts with an organizing committee of the FLP, which had signaled its intention to call a presidential nominating convention in St. Paul, Minnesota opening May 30, 1924. =Opening of the convention= Twelve hundred delegates and nine thousand spectators ratified the nomination of Senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr. The atmosphere was more sober than the one that had prevailed in 1912, where Theodore Roosevelt elicited much enthusiasm among the delegations. Farmers themselves were sparsely represented; they were too \\"broke\\" to come, according to Senator Lynn Frazier. Only one African-American sat in the audience and only one or two eastern intellectuals. The convention was called by the Conference for Progressive Political Action, and duly accredited delegates appeared for such organizations as: the Food Reform Society of America, the National Unity Committee, and the Davenport Iowa Ethical Society. Many students attended, one of the largest groups coming from Columbia University. Jacob Coxey was present as well as John J. Streeter. Radical labor leaders constituted the main body of the congregation, but they refused to let members of the Communist party enter the building. The Credentials Committee reported unfavorably on the credential of William Mahoney as an individual, while not denying the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party a right to a seat, citing his acts during and after the St. Louis Conference as well as his active participation in the June 1924 St. Paul Convention of the Federated Farmer-Labor Party, a gathering perceived to have been an appendage of the Workers Party of America and previously condemned by the National Committee of the CPPA. The CPPA National Committee had previously requested that Wisconsin Senator Robert M. La Follette make a run for the presidency. The Cleveland Convention was addressed by the Senator's son, Robert M. La Follette Jr., who read a message from his father accepting the call and declaring that the time had come \\"for a militant political movement independent of the two old party organizations.\\" La Follette declined to lead a third party, however, seeking to protect those progressives elected nominally as Republicans and Democrats. La Follette declared that the primary issue of the 1924 campaign was the breaking of the \\"combined power of the private monopoly system over the political and economic life of the American people.\\" After the November election a new party might well be established, La Follette stated, around which all progressives could unite. It was the dream of some Progressives, but not La Follette, that they might replace the Democrats, and thereby bring a clearer ideological alignment to American politics. The best way to do this, according to John A. H. Hopkins, earlier a prominent member of the Rooseveltian Progressive Party, would be to prevent either of the major parties from gaining a majority in the Electoral College and thus force the House of Representatives to choose the President. The convention ended without a nominee for vice president. La Follette at first offered the job to Justice Louis Brandeis, and on his refusal, Sen. Burton K. Wheeler of Montana, who gratefully accepted.

In April 1938, Dunlap also purchased an additional 42 acres outside of Edwardsville to form the lake space itself. Construction of the lake began on November 1940 and the first phase was completed in May 1941. The beginning of World War II halted the road construction around the lake because road oil was not available. After the war, construction was completed in 1946 and Dunlap began selling the 526 lots. At that time there were 252 lots along the 15 miles of lakefront.

Date revised: 1938 History The station was not included in the tenders issued for the building of the stations even though Drybridge had been included in the list agreed upon on 3 July 1883 by the Highland Railway Board. Following the delivery of a petition from the inhabitants of Drybridge village a station was opened by the Highland Railway on 1 April 1885 at a cost of ¬£210. It was located on the \\"up\\" side of the line and was reached via a gate at the roadside and a path through the field. In 1889 the inhabitants of Drybridge petitioned for a goods station however it was decided that the gradients were too steep and the request was declined. Seven years later a second attempt was made with the same result. In December 1906 it was decided to install a siding about one mile from Drybridge on the \\"Down\\" line facing Keith and lying towards Rathven for the delivery of clay and pipes required to construct a reservoir. By March 1909 the works had been completed and the siding was duly lifted. In 1889 Drybridge was upgraded in status through the appointment of a station master, Alexander Dott, who had been a porter at Buckie and who was to be the only station master for Drybridge. The station did not prosper for it was decided that not all trains should stop at Drybridge and the station became a request stop. The construction of the GNoSR Moray coast route \\"effectively doomed the Highland route. Westbound journeys were shorter via the GNSR, and although the route to Aberdeen was longer, the Moray Coast Railway had services that were faster, more frequent and more convenient, with through trains running from Elgin, along the coast and to Aberdeen. As a rather straggly branch line, the Highland route struggled to compete, and the population between Buckie and Keith was too sparse to provide much additional traffic.\\"Long Lost Railways Accessed : 2015-01-23 =Suspension of services and final closure= Ruins of the old overbridge. Drybridge had a short life with services being suspended during World War I on 7 August 1915} and the rails south of Buckie removed for use at Inverness and Invergordon by the Admiralty, the station buildings being left intact as it was hoped to restart services after the war had ended. The line remained closed in 1923, when the Highland Railway was absorbed by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). After this the track was relaid following the removal of whin and gorse scrub and the laying of new ballast, but services were not restarted even though the station was officially renamed 'Letterfourie' in April 1925 due to the presence in Ayrshire of another Drybridge that had passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway from the Glasgow and South Western Railway. The track was removed again in 1937.Geograph The nearby Aultmore became the terminus of a goods spur from Keith and continued in use until 1966. Work had begun on the Keith to Portessie line of the Highland Railway on 7 November 1882. Wartime economies led to closure of the line on 7 August 1915 and in 1917 the track between Aultmore (towards Keith) and Portessie was requisitioned by the Admiralty. The Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) re-opened the north and south sections of line by 1919, but the Aultmore to Portessie section (passing through Drybridge) was never re-opened and the track was again removed in 1937 to 'aid the war effort'. As stated 'Letterfourie station' is recorded at this site on the 1938 OS map with railway track in situ, the name is that of the nearby house and estate. The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) had renamed the station, but never actually reopened it or this section of the line. =Infrastructure= The station had a single platform, a small shelter with two sections, a signal in 1902 only and an over bridge on the Rathven side.Elginshire Sheet XIV.NE. Publication date: 1905. Date revised: 1903. Drybridge platform was built of timber. In April 1907 the signals were taken out of use at the intermediate stations. The station buildings consisted of a single platform and a small building consisting of a ticket office and a waiting room. After confirmation of closure the station was sold to one of the demolition workers for ¬£5 and was taken to Keith. The site today No remains of the station are to be found at the site, however the gate post survives in situ and the sections of the road leading to the overbridge remain together with remnants of the bridge itself. The style of the nearby cottages suggests that they may have been built for railway workers.

Family Turnor was the son of Edmund Turnor (died 1805) and his wife Mary (died 1818), daughter of John Disney of Lincoln, and was a descendant of Sir Edmund Turnor the brother of 17th-century judge Christopher Turnor. Turnor's father held estates at Stoke Rochford and Panton in Lincolnshire; following the death of his father, these estates passed to Turnor. He was married twice, first to Elizabeth (died 1801), the daughter of Philip Broke of Broke Hall in Suffolk, and sister to Sir Philip Bowes Vere Broke. The marriage produced a daughter, Elizabeth Edmunda. His second marriage was to Dorothea, daughter of Lieutenant-colonel Tucker and sister of Sir Edward Tucker KCB, producing five sons (Christopher, Cecil, Algernon, Henry Marten, and Philip Broke), and two daughters (Charlotte and Harriet). Of his and Dorothea's offspring, Christopher became a promoter and architect of Lincolnshire vernacular buildings, MP, and husband of Lady Caroline Finch-Hatton; Algernon became an Anglican cleric and married Sophia, daughter of Sir Thomas Whichcote, 6th Baronet; and Henry Marten became a captain in the King's Dragoon Guards and married Marianne Macdonald, daughter of 3rd Baron Macdonald, and a descendant of Lady Anne, sister of King Edward IV. Turnor was the maternal uncle to Sir William Foulis and Sir Thomas Whichcote. Edmund Turnor died on 19 March 1829 and was buried in the family vault, installed in 1801 at St Andrew and St Mary's Church, Stoke Rochford.Massue, Melville Henry, Marquis of Ruvigny and Raineval (1911); The Plantagenet Roll of the Blood Royal: The Mortimer-Percy Volume, p. 392\\\\.

In 1778 he was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and in 1786, a fellow of the Royal Society. Before gaining fellowships Turnor commissioned drawings of antiquities found during his tour of Normandy, including that of a now non-existent fountain in the Place de la Pucelle, Rouen, these presented and read to the Society of Antiquaries, including a description of the fortress at Rouen (Ch√¢teau du Vieux Palais\\"Ch√¢teau du Vieux Palais at Rouen in Normandy\\", Arch Expo ‚Äì France- British Cooperation Project. Retrieved 23 January 2015), built by Henry V. He later became a fellow of the Royal Academy of Rouen. Turnor became a Justice of the Peace and in 1810‚Äì11 High Sheriff for Lincolnshire, and between 1802 and 1806, MP for the borough of Midhurst. Among Turnor's friends and collaborators were the biographer Andrew Kippis, the antiquarians Daniel Lysons, Samuel Lysons and Richard Gough, the writer Bennet Langton, and the naturalist Joseph Banks who was a close friend. It was for Andrew Kippis that he provided in 1793 a memoir of Sir Richard Fanshawe for Biographia Britannica, largely based on his reading of Fanshawe's wife Lady Fanshawe‚Äôs manuscript memoirs of her husband. Lady Fanshawe, the daughter of Sir John Harrison, was the sister of Margaret, the wife of Turnor‚Äôs ancestor Sir Edmund Turnor. The Turnor‚Äôs gained possession of the Stoke Rochford Hall and estates from the Harrison family though this marriage. In 1824 Turnor founded a National School in Colsterworth run under the principles of Scottish educationalist Dr Bell, which also served nearby villages and parishes of Stoke Rochford, Skillington, and Woolsthorpe. The school included a school room and an adjoining house and garden for the schoolmaster. A Roman bath was discovered by Turnor on the banks of the River Witham near Stoke Rochford.

The handles are close to the body and small. The foot is tiny in proportion to the vase. The amphora was uncovered in 1813 in Athens and is named after Thomas Burgon (1787‚Äì1858), a merchant of the Levant Company, who brought it to England and sold it to the museum. It was discovered full of bone fragments, having been used as a funerary urn. The back side of the vase was seriously damaged by a pick-axe during the excavation. Description The vase is painted in the black figure style with images of the Greek goddess Athena, a flying siren and an owl, as well as a two-horse chariot. Athena is facing to the left. She wears a helmet with a low crest; its main section resembles a cap. The left arm swings a spear with a very carefully illustrated tip. The clothing of the goddess consists of a long sleeveless peplos belted at the waist. The diploidion ‚Äì a part of the peplos whipped over the shoulders ‚Äì is decorated with a meander, while the skirt itself is decorated with a vertical band, which consists of full squares, and with a hem. Athena's feet are placed apart, firmly on the ground line. The Aegis' border of snakes is represented by two large writhing snakes and one peeping up over her shoulder. The shield which Athena bears with her right arm, bears a dolphin facing to the left. Left of Athena is the inscription, written from right to left, Œ§ŒüŒùŒëŒòŒïŒùŒïŒò(Œï)ŒùŒëŒòŒõŒüŒùŒïŒúŒô (\\"I am the Atheneth(eia) prize\\") in sixth-century BC orthography. On the back side of the vase there is a beardless, seated charioteer wearing red clothing. His feet on a running board, he drives a two-horse chariot to the right. He holds the reins in his right hand and the kalaurops (staff with bells), to goad the horse on. The shape of the wheels, with only two spokes and two reinforcing struts extending perpendicular to them resembles the bronze wheel from Olympia. On the unornamented neck there is a siren on the front and an owl on the back, both with their wings held in exactly the same posture.

German industrial leader Hanns Martin Schleyer was kidnapped on 5 September 1977, by the Red Army Faction (RAF), also known as Baader-Meinhof Gang, in Cologne, West Germany. It was intended to force the West German government to release Andreas Baader and three other RAF members being held at the Stammheim Prison near the city of Stuttgart. On 18 October 1977, on learning that three of their members had died in prison, the RAF killed Martin Schleyer. Course of events Schleyer's abduction was planned by Siegfried Haag, but he was arrested in 1976, so his replacement, Brigitte Mohnhaupt, carried out the abduction. On 5 September 1977, an RAF ‚Äúcommando unit‚Äù attacked the chauffeured car carrying Schleyer, then president of the German employers' association, in Cologne, just after the car had turned right from Friedrich Schmidt Strasse into Vincenz-Statz Strasse. His driver, Heinz Marcisz, 41, was forced to brake when a baby carriage suddenly appeared in the street in front of them. The police escort vehicle behind them was unable to stop in time, and crashed into Schleyer's car. Four (or possibly five) masked RAF members then jumped out and sprayed machine gun and machine pistol bullets into the two vehicles, killing Marcisz and a police officer, Roland Pieler, 20, who was seated in the backseat of Marcisz's car. The driver of the police escort vehicle, Reinhold Br√§ndle, 41 and a third police officer, Helmut Ulmer, 24, who was in the second vehicle were also killed. The hail of bullets riddled over twenty bullet wounds into the bodies of Br√§ndle and Pieler.[3] Schleyer was then pulled out of the car and forced into the RAF assailants' own getaway van. Schleyer was hidden in a highrise in Erftstadt (Liblar) near Cologne. The police came very close to finding him, but due to lack of internal communication could not rescue him. Several local police officers were convinced that Schleyer was held in the aforementioned highrise close to the autobahn. One investigator had rung the doorbell of the apartment in question, but nobody had conveyed this information to the crisis center of the federal police. The RAF demanded that the government release imprisoned members of their group. The government refused to give into RAF's demands or negotiate. The RAF sent the government a picture of Schleyer alive, in captivity, on 8 October 1977. After 43 days, the government had not given in to the demands of the kidnappers. Hours after the German counterterrorism unit GSG 9 ended the Palestinian hijack of Lufthansa Flight 181, the imprisoned RAF members Baader, Gudrun Ensslin and Jan-Carl Raspe were found dead in their prison cells. After Schleyer's kidnappers received the news of the death of their imprisoned comrades, Schleyer was taken from Brussels, Belgium on 18 October 1977, and shot dead en route to Mulhouse, France, where his body was left in the trunk of a green Audi 100 on the rue Charles P√©guy. Investigation On 9 September 2007, former RAF member Peter-J√ºrgen Boock mentioned that the RAF members Rolf Heissler and Stefan Wisniewski were responsible for Schleyer's death. Schleyer's widow, Waltrude Schleyer, campaigned against clemency for his kidnappers and other members of the RAF. She died on 21 March 2008, in Stuttgart.

The school serves students from \\"maternelle\\" (kindergarten) up to the \\"lyc√©e\\" (sixth form college/senior high school) level. The French school is located in the district of Praunheim, to the northwest of Frankfurt. Students are taught the French national curriculum and they can choose to prepare the Baccalaur√©at or the Abibac. The current head of the school is M. Nicolas Commenville.  History  In 1949 the first classes were taught to French students living in Frankfurt. In the 1960s the initiative developed into a school with different classes, an official status and more than 150 students. With 550 students in 2000 the school opened at its current location in Praunheim. The primary school obtained Ersatzschule status in 2007 and the middle school in 2012. By 2014 enrollment had reached 1,000 students, divided into 48 classes.  About the school  * The LFVH is a French school with an international recruitment: over 35 different nationalities are typically represented. * The school moved to its current premises in 2000. The building was designed by architect Michel Regembal (also known for his contribution to the Stade de France). * After being run by parents' associations for decades the school came under AEFE control in 2000. * In 2007 the primary school obtained Ersatzschule status and so did the middle school in 2012. * The German Staatliches Schulamt Frankfurt supervises the school's German component of the curriculum and the delivery of the Abitur. * In September 2014 there were 1004 students registered in the school. * LFVH is a whole-day school, including in the primary section.  Studying at the LFVH  The French national curriculum is demanding and exhaustive. Like all French schools in France and abroad, LFVH adheres to it. * If parents and students choose the bilingual (French-German) track, this curriculum is supplemented by essential teachings which fit the German educational requirements. These students usually go on to sit the Abibac, a combination of the French and the German end-of-secondary-education diplomas, allowing them direct access to both French and German universities and colleges. * The foreign languages students can learn at the LFVH: German, English, Spanish (as a first, second or third foreign language), and Latin. * Extra-curricular activities include: chess club, sports club, arts club, drama club, music club, the Students' Council, and many others. Students participate in competitions in mathematics, language arts, sciences and sports in Germany, France and across Europe. Trips are organised on a regular basis to sites around Germany, Austria, France and the UK. * A study time (Aide aux devoirs) is organised for middle school students who need support for their homework. * Students with special needs also receive specific support. * Students from the age of 3 can also attend Le P'tit Victor, the CEFA or l'Acad√©mie, all structures independent from the LFVH but which take care of LFVH students after class and offer all sorts of activities, including, for some, during the holiday.

Firor (October 18, 1927 - November 5, 2007) was an American physicist. He was Director of the High Altitude Observatory (HAO) from 1961 to 1968, and Director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) from 1968 to 1974. John Firor was one of the first scientists hired by NCAR, arriving in 1961 to head the High Altitude Observatory just as HAO was being absorbed into the new center. From 1974 to 1980, Firor served as executive director of NCAR, after which he managed the Advanced Study Program up to his retirement in 1996. He mentored countless numbers of young scientists, maintaining his gentle sense of humor and his keen perspective. This image shows Firor lecturing in 1968.  Biographical information  Firor was born in Athens, Georgia on October 18, 1927, where his father, John William Firor, was a professor of agricultural economics and his mother, Mary Valentine Moss, was a homemaker. John was the second youngest of four children. His sister, Anne Firor Scott(b. April 24, 1921), was a historian. His two brothers were Hugh Firor (March 24, 1929 - September 24, 2012 ), a medical doctor, and David (Nov 4, 1923- Oct 17, 2000), a soil and water district supervisor for the Oconee River District. His interest in physics and astrophysics began while serving in the army, during which time he was assigned to the Los Alamos National Laboratory. After his service, he returned to college and graduated in physics from Georgia Tech in 1949. He received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Chicago in 1954, writing his thesis on cosmic rays under John Simpson. He moved from cosmic rays to radio astronomy (particularly of the Sun) when he began work at the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism. He was married twice, to Merle Jenkins Firor (who died in 1979) and Judith Jacobsen (who died in 2004). He had four children by his first wife: Daniel, Kay, James, and Susan. Firor died on November 5, 2007, after a long battle with Alzheimer's disease.  Career at HAO and NCAR  Firor left the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1961 to become Director of the High Altitude Observatory (HAO), a position he occupied until 1968. Whilst HAO Director, Firor led the development of the new Solar Physics Division (SPD) of the American Astronomical Society (AAS), and became the SPD's founding chair. In 1968, he became the Director of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), of which HAO was a scientific division. He served as NCAR Director until 1974, when Francis Bretherton became director. From 1974 to 1980, Firor served as executive director of NCAR, after which he became Director of NCAR's Advanced Study Program up to his retirement in 1996.  Scientific publications  Firor wrote many papers on cosmic rays, radio sources in the universe, the Sun's atmosphere, and solar flares. He also participated in HAO expeditions to observe solar eclipses in New Guinea, Brazil, and Kenya. Later in his career, Firor took a keen interest in the intersection of science and society, and he became one of the earliest and most eloquent spokespeople on the dangers of human-induced climate change, testifying before Congressional committees and addressing a broad variety of audiences. His book, Our Changing Atmosphere (1990), received the Louis J. Battan Award from the American Meteorological Society. Firor and his second wife, Judith Jacobsen, co-authored The Crowded Greenhouse (2002), on the links between climate change and population growth.

Kakuryu takes the most prestigious spot, East Yokozuna, for the first time. There is one newcomer to the top division, Mitakeumi, who reaches makuuchi only four tournaments after his professional debut, the second fastest since the start of the Sh≈çwa era (although due to his amateur sumo achievements at Toyo University he was given special dispensation to start in the third highest division, makushita). =November= Harumafuji won his first championship in two years in November. *5: Hakuho declares himself fit for the Kyushu tournament, having recovered from the left knee injury that forced him out in September. He is competing in his 50th basho as a yokozuna, putting him in sole possession of fourth place on the all-time list. *20: The chairman of the Japan Sumo Association, former yokozuna Kitanoumi dies of colorectal cancer at the age of 62. He had been in Fukuoka for the current tournament and was taken to hospital suffering from anemia, after which his condition worsened. Hakkaku Oyakata, the former yokozuna Hokutoumi, is named acting chairman. A memorial service for Kitanoumi is announced for December 22. *22:The Kyushu tournament is won by Harumafuji on his return from a two basho absence. It is his seventh championship and first in two years. He loses on the final day to Kisenosato to finish on 13‚Äì2, but Hakuho cannot take advantage, losing to Kakuryu. Hakuho finishes on 12‚Äì3 having been 12‚Äì0 up, and has to share second place with rank-and-filers Ikioi and Shohozan, who both receive the Fighting Spirit Award. The Technique Award goes to Yoshikaze ‚Äì his fourth special prize in the last three tournaments. Ozeki Goeido preserves his rank with a bare majority of wins, 8‚Äì7.

These hollow fiber membranes are often bundled and housed within tubular polycarbonate shells to create hollow fiber bioreactor cartridges. Within the cartridges, which are also fitted with inlet and outlet ports, are two compartments: the intracapillary (IC) space within the hollow fibers, and the extracapillary (EC) space surrounding the hollow fibers. Cells are seeded into the EC space of the hollow fiber bioreactor and expand there. Cell culture medium is pumped through the IC space and delivers oxygen and nutrients to the cells via hollow fiber membrane perfusion. As the cells expand, their waste products and CO2 also perfuse the hollow fiber membranes and are carried away by the pumping of medium through the IC space. As waste products build up due to increased cell mass, the rate of medium flow can also be increased so that cell growth is not inhibited by waste product toxicity. Because thousands of hollow fibers may be packed into a single hollow fiber bioreactor, they increase the surface area of the cartridge considerably. As a result, cells can fill up the EC space to densities >108 cells/ml. However, the cartridge itself takes up a very small volume (oftentimes the volume of a 12-oz soda can). The fact that hollow fiber bioreactors are very small and yet enable incredibly high cell densities has led to their development for both research and commercial applications, including monoclonal antibody and influenza vaccineHirschel M, Gangemi JD, McSharry J., Myers C. Novel Uses for Hollow Fiber Bioreactors Genetic Engineering News Jun 15, 2011 (Vol. 31, No. 12). production. Likewise, because hollow fiber bioreactors use up significantly less medium and growth factors than traditional cell culture methods such as stirred-tank bioreactors, they offer a significant cost savings. Finally, hollow fiber bioreactors are sold as single-use disposables, resulting in significant time savings for laboratory staff and technicians.  History  In 1972, the Richard KnazekKnazek RA, Gullino PM, Kohler PO, Dedrick RL. Cell culture on artificial capillaries: an approach to tissue growth in vitro. Science. 1972 Oct 6;178(4056):65-6. group at the NIH reported how mouse fibroblasts cultured on 1.5 cm3 hollow fiber capillary membranes composed of cellulose acetate were able to form 1 mm-wide nodules in 28 days. The group recorded the final cell number as approximately 1.7 x 107 cells from a starter batch of only 200,000 cells. When the same group cultured human choriocarcinoma cells on polymeric and silicone polycarbonate capillary membranes totaling less than 3 cm3 in volume, the cells expanded to an amount approximating 2.17 x 108 cells. The Knazek group was awarded the patent for hollow fiber bioreactor technology in 1974.Cell culture on semi-permeable tubular membranes U.S. Patent US 3821087 A Based on this patented technology, companies began building different and larger (commercial) scale hollow fiber bioreactors, with significant development and technological improvement occurring in the late 1980s to early 1990s. By 1990, at least three companies were reported to offer commercially available hollow fiber bioreactors.Ahern, H. Hollow Fiber Bioreactor Systems Increase Cell Culture Yield The Scientist Magazine (1990) One engineering advance included adding a gas exchange cartridge, which enabled better control of system's pH and oxygen levels. Similar to a mammalian lung, the gas exchange cartridge efficiently oxygenated the culture medium, allowing the bioreactor to support higher numbers of cells. Combined with the ability to add or remove CO2 for precise pH control, the limitations commonly associated with large-scale cell culture were eliminated, resulting in densely packed cell cultures that could be maintained for several months. In addition, control of the fluid dynamics within each hollow fiber bioreactor led to further optimization of the cell culture environment. By alternating the pressure gradient across the hollow fiber membrane, media could flow back and forth between the EC side (cell compartment) and the IC side (hollow fiber lumen). This process, combined with the axial media flow created when media passes down the length of the fibers, optimized the growth environment throughout the entire bioreactor. This concept is termed EC cycling, Extra-capillary fluid cycling system and method for a cell culture. U.S. Patent US 20130058907 A1 and was developed as a solution to the gradients that form within hollow fiber bioreactors when media is pushed down the length of their fibers. Higher hydrostatic pressure at the axial end (media entering the fiber lumen) compared to the distal end of the bioreactor creates a Starling flow in the EC space, which is similar to what is observed in the body. This phenomenon also creates a nutrient-rich axial region and a nutrient-depleted distal region within the bioreactor. By incorporating EC cycling, the effects of Starling flow are eliminated and the entire bioreactor becomes nutrient-rich and optimized for cell growth. Optimal IC and EC space perfusion rates must be achieved in order to efficiently deliver media nutrients and growth supplements, respectively, and to collect supernatant. During the cell growth phase within these bioreactors, the media feed rate is increased to accommodate the expanding cell population. More specifically, the IC media perfusion rate is increased to provide additional glucose and oxygen to the cells while continually removing metabolic wastes such as lactic acid. When the cell space is completely filled with cells, the media feed rate plateaus, resulting in constant glucose consumption, oxygen uptake and lactate production rates.  Applications  With the introduction of hybridoma technology in 1975,Kohler, G., and C. Milstein. 1975. Continuous cultures of fused cells secreting antibody of predefined specificity. Nature 256:495. cell culture could be applied towards the generation of secreted proteins such as monoclonal antibodies, growth hormones, and even some categories of vaccines. In order to produce these proteins on a commercial scale, new methods for culturing large batches of cells had to be developed. One such technological development was the hollow fiber bioreactor. Hollow fiber bioreactors are used to generate high concentrations of cell-derived products including monoclonal antibodies, recombinant proteins, growth factors, viruses and virus-like particles. This is possible because the semi- permeable hollow fiber membranes allow for the passage of low molecular weight nutrients and wastes from the cell-containing EC into the non-cell-containing IC space, but they do not allow the passage of larger products such as antibodies. Therefore, as a cell line (e.g., hybridoma) expands and expresses a target protein, that protein remains within the EC space and is not flushed out. At a given time point (or continually during the culture), the harvest supernatant (product) is collected, clarified and refrigerated for a future downstream application. Smaller hollow fiber bioreactors are often used for selection and optimization of cell linesGramer, MJ. Britton TL. Selection and Isolation of Cells for Optimal Growth in Hollow Fiber Bioreactors Hybridoma 2000. 19(5):407-412. prior to stepping up to larger cell culturing systems. Doing so saves on growth factor costs because a significant portion of the cell culture media does not require the addition of expensive components like fetal bovine serum. Likewise, the smaller hollow fiber bioreactors can be housed in a laboratory incubator just like cell culture plates and flasks. Recently, hollow fiber bioreactors have been tested as novel platforms for the commercial production of high-titer influenza A virus.Tapia, F. et al. Production of high-titer human influenza A virus with adherent and suspension MDCK cells cultured in a single-use hollow fiber bioreactor Vaccine 32 (2014): 1003-1011. In this study, both adherent and suspension Madin-Darby Canine Kidney Epithelial Cells (MDCK) were infected with two different strains of influenza: A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), and the pandemic strain A/Mexico/4108/2009 (H1N1). High titers were achieved for both the suspension and adherent strains; furthermore, the hollow fiber bioreactor technology was found comparable in its production capacity to that of other commercial bioreactors on the market, including classic stirred-tank and wave bioreactors (Wave) and ATF perfusion systems.

The first use of fluidic oscillators in the form of sweeping jets for flow control was demonstrated by Raman et al., 1999. and later by several authors working in the area of flow control. Many organizations have been working on the use of such actuators for flow control. Boeing, NASA and the University of Arizona Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering, Illinois Institute of Technology, [Advanced Fluidics], Technical University of Berlin are a few of them. They are slots built into the control surface of an airfoil that build on the same principles as that of blown flaps; that by actively blowing air over the surface of an airfoil the effective lift produced by it is increased. Mechanism The impetus behind the research into sweeping jet actuators lies in the realization that any vertical tail structure on an aircraft is a parasitic surface in level flight. The design specification that must be met by the vertical stabilizer of any multi-engined aircraft is that it be able to produce enough lift to counteract any thrust asymmetry that would come as a result of engine failure during rotation (takeoff); but in any condition that is not an emergency or where a yaw moment is not desired the vertical stabilizer will only contribute added weight and drag to the aircraft. The jet nozzles (located directly upstream of the hinge around which the rudder moves) eject a subsonic stream of air that flows over the rudder and act to retain or reattach the boundary layer to the control surface as it is deflected beyond the incidence angle where natural flow would separate, generating as much as a 30-percent increase in the effective lift produced by the rudder. History As of January 2015 sweeping jet actuators have only seen experimental application and are not included as a design feature of any known aircraft.

Life Jan van der Noot was born to a noble family in Brecht, in the Duchy of Brabant, about halfway between Antwerp and Breda. In 1558 he moved to Antwerp and at some point became a Calvinist. In 1567, during the early stages of the Dutch Revolt, he was implicated in an attempted coup in Antwerp and fled to England.L√©onard Willems, \\"Noot (Jean-Baptiste vander)\\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 15 (Brussels, 1899), 866‚Äì877. His first work was published by John Day in Dutch and French editions in London as Het theatre oft toon-neel and Le theatre. The following year Edmund Spenser's English translation, A theatre wherein be represented as wel the miseries & calamities that follow the voluptuous worldlings, came out with Henry Bynneman. It was a combined work in verse and prose, reflecting on the deceits and shortcomings of the world. In 1571 he was in Cleves, and in 1572 in Cologne. He eventually returned to Antwerp in 1579. Ironically, he was now a Catholic and the city was coming under the rule of Calvinists. In Antwerp he produced a series of volumes of new verse, all with the title De poeticsche werken. He died in 1595.

Army creole was a term used in Tom Wolfe's book The Right Stuff to describe an English dialect spoken by military personnel. The dialect relies upon extensive use of profane intensifiers like \\"fuck\\" to gain attention in confusing circumstances requiring prompt, decisive action. Before 1980, basic training drill instructors, drill sergeants, military training instructors, and recruit division commanders used the dialect to increase the stress-levels of recruits, simultaneously emphasizing a recruit's subordinate status to the instructor, and increasing the probability of the recruit focusing on the instructions being provided in distracting situations.

Evolution AWOL entered the vocabulary during World War I, and acronyms became increasingly important to simplify descriptions of command structure and technical innovations of mid-20th-century warfare.

It is a small orchid, common within its range and about half the size of the common donkey orchid, Diuris corymbosa. Description Diuris laxiflora is a tuberous, perennial herb with 4 to 6 tufted leaves, each 60-150 mm long and 2-3 mm wide. The flower stem is 300-500 mm long with 1 to 6 flowers. The flowers are 10-13 mm across, are yellow with brown spots and appear from August to October. Taxonomy and naming The species was first described by John Lindley in 1839 and published in his \\"A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony\\" (1840). In The Genera and Species of Orchidaceous Plants he wrote \\"The pedicels and ovary together are about 3 inches long, which is less than the length of the internodes. Each stem bears from 4 to 8 flowers, which seem to be dark yellow, with no spotting, but perhaps with some stains of purple.\\" The specific epithet (laxiflora) is derived from the Latin words laxus meaning 'wide', 'loose' or 'open' and floris, 'flower', referring to the open arrangement of the flowers. The proper word for \\"flower\\" in classical and botanical Latin is flos, genitive singular floris.Lewis, C.T. & Short, C. (1879).

He has released 16 CDs as a leader and performed on countless other albums as a sideman, having worked with artists such as Buddy Rich, Frank Sinatra, and Steely Dan. Author and journalist Cicily Janus regards Weiskopf as \\"one of the best unknown musicians in the modern scene\\", and JazzTimes Magazine considers him to be underrated and \\"a highly potent tenor saxophonist who demonstrates a strong Trane-Rollins influence\\". Early life Weiskopf was born in Augusta, Georgia and grew up outside of Syracuse, New York. He took up his first instrument, the clarinet, at age 10 and began his saxophone studies four years later. He studied at the Eastman School of Music of the University of Rochester from 1977‚Äì80. After earning his BA in Music Performance he moved to New York City in September 1980. Professional career Weiskopf began his New York career performing with the Buddy Rich Big Band in 1981 at the age of 21, and began a 14-year stint with the Toshiko Akiyoshi Jazz Orchestra two years later. Since then he has released 16 recordings as a leader, and holds numerous credits as a sideman. It was 1988 when Weiskopf decided to attend Queens College of the City of New York, where he spent 2 years studying with clarinetist Leon Russianoff, later earning a Master of Arts degree in clarinet performance. Over the next two decades he went on to perform with a number of notable orchestras including the American Ballet Theatre Orchestra, the American Composers Orchestra, and the Gotham Chamber Orchestra. In 2002, Weiskopf became a part of the popular music group Steely Dan, and was featured on the title track of their 2003 album Everything Must Go. A few years later in 2006, he began to tour and perform with the Donald Fagen Band, as well as with the Dukes of September Rhythm Revue in 2010. In addition to performing, Weiskopf has taught at a number of different universities, as well as authored several books on jazz improvisation. Weiskopf was an Adjunct Professor at New Jersey City University in Jersey City, New Jersey from 1996‚Äì2000. From 2001 to 2009, Weiskopf was a visiting associate professor at the Eastman School of Music, and taught part-time at Temple University in Philadelphia from 2010 to 2012. He is currently an Coordinator of Jazz Studies at New Jersey City University in Jersey City, New Jersey. In 1991 and 1993 respectively, Weiskopf co-authored Coltrane: A Player's Guide To His Harmony and The Augmented Scale in Jazz (pub. J. Aebersold) with Ramon Ricker, and completed Intervalic Improvisation (pub. Aebersold) in 1994. Weiskopf's fourth book, Around The Horn, was released in 2001 and Beyond The Horn, a sequel, co-authored with his former student Ed RosenBerg, was released in 2006. His most recent book, Understanding the Diminished Scale, was released in 2013. Recognition Weiskopf has received three performance grants from the National Endowment for the Arts. He also was awarded funding for the creation and recording of his 2004 sextet recording Sight to Sound (Criss Cross Jazz) from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation and Chamber Music America. This suite of ten movements was inspired by the work of visual artists Dal√≠, Picasso, Van Gogh, Mir√≥, and others.

He earned a national reputation for preserving cowboy lore and traditions. Early life Ramsey was born in New Home, Texas, into a musical family. His father gave his newborn son the nickname Buckskin Tarbox, and from then on he went by the nickname Buck. He was the oldest son of the family and the middle child with five sisters and a younger brother. As a child he attended a two-room schoolhouse at Middle Well near Amarillo. Growing up in the farmland his childhood dream was to become a cowboy. His uncles, especially Uncle Ed, told stories and taught him cowboy ways and cowboy songs. Born with perfect pitch, he learned traditional shape note singing and sang regularly in Primitive Baptist Church \\"sings\\" and choirs. When he was a young teen he moved with his family to Amarillo. In high school, he sang with a band called the Sandie Swingsters. In 1956, Buck graduated from Amarillo High School and enrolled in what is now Texas Tech. To support himself in school, he worked at part-time jobs on ranches around Lubbock. His love of the outdoors made him quickly leave school to travel around the country. In 1958 he returned to Texas and enrolled in what is now West Texas A&M; University. He continued working as a cowboy on big West Texas ranches. He continued this life until 1962, when injuries sustained in a riding accident left him paralyzed from the chest down. He got around in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Poet and musician During rehabilitation after his accident, he rekindled an earlier interest in cowboy poetry. He submitted some poems to the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering in Elko, Nevada. That began his career as a professional cowboy poet, performer and songwriter. His work artfully chronicled cowboy lore and traditions, earning him a national reputation for preserving cowboy culture. He performed and recorded the old ranching and trail songs, with the idea of saving them for posterity. His peers regarded his contemporary cowboy poetry as some of the best in that genre. His recordings of the traditional \\"Rolling Uphill from Texas\\" (1992) and \\"My Home It Was in Texas\\" (1994) each won Western Heritage Wrangler Awards from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame. In 1993 his epic poem, As I Rode Out on the Morning, was published by Texas Tech University Press. The prologue, \\"Anthem,\\" was highly acclaimed as a standalone work. Buck Ramsey's awards and achievements include a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts (1995), Lifetime Achievement and Best Poetry Book awards from the Academy of Western Artists (1996), and the Golden Spur Award from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame in 1997. His performances of cowboy poetry and songs have been featured at the Smithsonian Institution and at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in Los Angeles. His awards continued after his death in 1998. In 2002 the Academy of Western Artists named their annual poetry book award the Buck Ramsey Award in his honor. A two-CD set of his recordings titled Hittin' the Trail was released by Smithsonian Folkways Recordings in 2003. It won the 2004 Western Heritage Wrangler Award.

Plot As described in a film magazine, Nelly Gray (Novak), a member of a traveling show, is stranded when the manager abandons the troupe, and Sierra Bill (Hart), a member of a gang, helps with the gift of some gold. Although the gang leader has designs on the young woman, he agrees that the gang will fight it out among themselves and the last man standing will get her. Sierra Bill wins, and in a drunken fury forces Nelly to marry him. After the wedding he becomes the model husband and soon Sonny (Headrick) is born who is the apple of his father's eye. The gang leader returns with Rosita, a young Mexican woman, and discloses Sierra Bill's past to Nelly and suggests that he is even having an affair with Rosita.

The target platforms are Windows PC, Macintosh, Android and iOS. The game takes place in a fictional world, ‚ÄúNyrthos‚Äù, which is a continent surrounded by sea. Little is known about the actual storyline. Nyrthos draws a lot of influence from the Diablo and Gothic series. The game's core mechanics will be similar to other RPGs (e.g. killing monsters, leveling, learning new skills, looting), however, Nyrthos will also borrow mechanics from other genres, such as giving the players the option to build structures and manage resources like a simulation video game. The key idea of the game is an expanding world. Players will influence the story development, which will be based on their votes and actions. Nyrthos also features a day/night/weather cycle that strongly impacts the world. The night is very dark and deadly, so many actions have to be performed during the day. The cycle influences many things, such as enemies, spawnable items, and events.  About the Developers  BeerDeer Games is a small indie games development studio located in Prague, Czech Republic. It was founded in 2011 by two long time colleagues and friends, Martin Pivko and Martin Jel√≠nek. In the past, its founders dealt with a wide variety of projects in the area of flash, game, application, and web development. Nyrthos is their first original project and was supposed to come out for PC, Android and iOS in 2012, but did not make the deadline.  Technology and Platforms  The game is being developed using Stage3D and Starling and will be possibly both browser-based (using the flash plug-in) / installed. The target platforms are both browsers (PC, MAC) and mobiles (Android, iOS). The use of Stage 3D/Flash allows to utilize devices' graphics cards, even while running in the flash plug-in. Nyrthos creators promise smooth 2D visuals with more effects, eye-candy, animations, ad postprocessing. The use of graphics cards is also supposed to lower the performance load of the processor immensely; this should allow to make smarter enemies, area effects and explosions and other cool stuff.

Several hosts and musical guests have received negative press due to their appearances on the program, including musician Sin√©ad O'Connor, comedian Andrew Dice Clay, then-Presidential candidate Donald Trump, and the bands Rage Against the Machine and Fear. In the course of the show's forty-plus-year history, several technical issues have occurred live on air, most notably with singer Ashlee Simpson. Other times, controversial content has been edited out of syndicated reruns and online-distributed editions of the show, including coarse language. The show has \\"banned\\" certain hosts and has also been accused of plagiarism. Technical issues =Ashlee Simpson= In 2004, Ashlee Simpson was caught lip-syncing during her first appearance as a musical guest. Ashlee Simpson appeared as a musical guest on the October 23, 2004 episode with Jude Law as host. Her first performance, \\"Pieces of Me\\", was performed without incident, but when she began her second song, \\"Autobiography\\", the vocals for \\"Pieces of Me\\" were heard again‚Äîbefore she had even raised the microphone to her mouth. Simpson began to do an impromptu jig, and then left the stage. During the closing of the show, Simpson appeared with Law and said: \\"I feel so bad. My band started playing the wrong song. I didn't know what to do so I thought I'd do a hoedown.\\" On October 25, Simpson explained that due to complications arising from severe acid reflux disease, she had completely lost her voice and her doctor had advised her not to sing. Her father wanted her to use a vocal guide track for the performance after she had suffered vocal issues during rehearsals. Simpson stated of the incident, \\"I made a complete fool of myself.\\" According to Simpson, the drummer hit the wrong button, which caused the wrong track to be played. Lorne Michaels had been unaware of the plan to use lip synching, and said in an interview with 60 Minutes that he would not have allowed it if he had been consulted. Simpson is the only musical guest ever to walk off stage during a live performance. Simpson returned to the show on October 8, 2005, and performed without incident. Controversies =Fear= In 1981, director Penelope Spheeris made a film titled The Decline of Western Civilization; the film featured an appearance by the group Fear. This appearance in particular caught the attention of former cast member John Belushi, who lobbied successfully to get the band a spot as a musical guest on the 1981 Halloween episode of SNL. Belushi had originally offered Fear the soundtrack for his major motion picture Neighbors. The film's producers eventually forced Fear off the project, and Belushi got them the infamous SNL gig as compensation. The band's appearance included a group of slamdancers, among them Belushi, Ian MacKaye of Minor Threat (and later Fugazi), Tesco Vee of The Meatmen, Harley Flanagan and John Joseph of the Cro-Mags, and John Brannon of Negative Approach. The show's director originally wanted to prevent the dancers from participating, so Belushi offered to be in the episode if the dancers were allowed to stay. The result was the shortening of Fear's appearance on TV. Frontman Lee Ving started the band's second song by stating, \\"It's great to be in New Jersey\\", drawing boos from SNLs New York live audience. Fear played \\"I Don't Care About You\\", \\"Beef Bologna\\", \\"New York's Alright If You Like Saxophones\\", and started to play \\"Let's Have a War\\" when the telecast faded into commercial. The slamdancers left ripe pumpkin remains on the set. Cameras, a piano and other property were damaged in a situation that was close to a stage riot. After their SNL appearance, which resulted in $20,000 in damage, some clubs chose not to hire the band. A New York Post article later reported the figure to be $500,000. This is believed to have originated from Ving, who told the Post that \\"...we caused $500,000 worth of damage, a cool half a million dollars worth of damage, ‚Äòcause we‚Äôre professionals, and I counted the damage myself.\\"Citizenmag.com Since this incident, Fear has not appeared on Saturday Night Live again. =Andrew Dice Clay= When Andrew Dice Clay was scheduled as a host for the May 12, 1990 episode, cast member Nora Dunn immediately announced to the press that she was boycotting the show in protest. She stated the protest was in view of Clay's perceivedly misogynistic act, and did so without informing Michaels, the cast, or most of the crew about her intent. The public backlash was immediate; the selection of Clay was compared to the Holocaust by an audience member during an interview with Michaels. Female members of the cast and crew were harassed by phone and mail for sticking with the show, and metal detectors were installed at the studio to enhance security. NBC censors insisted that the episode be aired with a delay to compensate for anything Clay might say on air. During the live show, some audience members heckled Clay but were immediately removed by the increased security detail. Dunn's contract was already coming to an end, and with one episode left in the season, the staff voted against having her take part in the final episode of the season and her contract was not renewed. Dunn would later express her surprise at the lack of support she received from her colleagues in her refusal to participate. Sin√©ad O'Connor was scheduled to be the musical guest for the episode, but she also boycotted the show because of Clay's involvement, forcing the producers to find two musical replacements, with one performance by Julee Cruise and a second by Spanic Boys. =Sin√©ad O'Connor= On October 3, 1992, O'Connor was scheduled to appear, performing an a cappella performance of Bob Marley's \\"War\\". During the dress rehearsal, O'Connor held up a photo of a Balkan child as a protest of child abuse in war before bowing and leaving the stage, which the episode's director Dave Wilson described as a \\"very tender moment\\". During the live show, O'Connor changed the \\"War\\" lyric \\"fight racial injustice\\" to \\"fight child abuse\\" as a protest against the then still relatively unknown cases of sexual abuse in the Roman Catholic Church. She presented a photo of Pope John Paul II while singing the word \\"evil\\", before tearing the image into pieces and saying \\"Fight the real enemy!\\" NBC had no foreknowledge of O'Connor's plan, and Wilson purposely failed to use the \\"applause\\" button, leaving the audience to sit in silence. Tim Robbins, who was the host for that episode and was raised as a devout Catholic, refused to acknowledge O'Connor at the end of the show. NBC received thousands of irate calls in the aftermath of the incident, and protests against O'Connor occurred outside of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, where a steamroller crushed dozens of her tapes, CDs and LPs. In the following weeks on SNL, Catholic guests Joe Pesci and Madonna both voiced their opposition to O'Connor. The show also aired several sketches mocking O'Connor. She has not appeared on Saturday Night Live since. The incident occurred a full nine years before John Paul II, in a 2001 apology, acknowledged that the sexual abuse within the Church was \\"a profound contradiction of the teaching and witness of Jesus Christ\\",Pope sends first e-mail apology; http://news.bbc.co.uk; November 23, 2001 followed in 2008 by Pope Benedict XVI apologizing and meeting with victims, speaking of his \\"shame\\" at the evil of abuse, calling for perpetrators to be brought to justice, and denouncing mishandling by church authorities.Pope Deeply Sorry for Child Abuse; www.abc.net.au; July 19, 2008Pope's Apology: 'You have suffered grievously and I am truly sorry'; The Telegraph; March 20, 2010 , despite the now well documented thousands of abuse cases proving O'Connor's accusation (although there is no data that indicates that priests commit abuse more often than the general population), NBC still declines to rebroadcast the sequence with the exception of an interview with O'Connor on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, which aired on April 24, 2010, when the clip was aired in full. In reruns, the incident is replaced with the dress rehearsal performance. The original episode was made available on volume four of the DVD special \\"Saturday Night Live ‚Äì 25 Years of Music\\", with an introduction by Michaels about the incident. On February 20, 2011, the clip was aired on the SNL special \\"Backstage\\" showing footage of the dress rehearsal and live performance side by side. The footage cuts to interviewees during the moment the photo was ripped. The incident was mocked during an episode of the television show 30 Rock (created by former Saturday Night Live head writer Tina Fey) in which it is mentioned that Tracy Jordan, star of TGS (the show's in-universe analogue to Saturday Night Live) tore up a picture of the pope during an episode; it is replied, \\"In his defense, it was Pope Innocent IV, because he increased taxation in the Papal States.\\" A later episode parodied the Saturday Night Live incident when an NBC page (Kristen Schaal) goes on stage and tears a picture of O'Connor in half. It was also mocked in the third episode of The Life of Rock with Brian Pern, which features the fictional title musician Brian Pern's appearance on a 1992 episode of Saturday Night Live, where he tears up a picture of The Fonz, calling him \\"evil\\" after remarking \\"lies\\", as a protest against Happy Days providing a distraction to the American public from American foreign policy aggression. This incident was also spoofed by the Australian band TISM on the album cover of Censored Due to Legal Advice. The album really was censored due to a lawsuit. The original name of the album was Australia the Lucky Cunt depicted a koala drawn in the style of artist Ken Done with a syringe in its mouth. Done was angered by this cover and on the week after the album's September 1993 release date obtained an injunction order banning the sale of the album. The album was re-released in November the same year under the Censored Due to Legal Advice title with the cover depicting four images of O'Connor on Saturday Night Live edited to show her tearing up a sheet of the TISM logo and the album title on it instead of the pope. =Rage Against the Machine= Rage Against the Machine displayed two upside-down American flags. On April 13, 1996, musical guests Rage Against the Machine (RATM) were scheduled to perform two songs. The show was hosted that night by billionaire and then-presidential candidate Steve Forbes. According to RATM guitarist Tom Morello, \\"RATM wanted to stand in sharp juxtaposition to a billionaire telling jokes and promoting his flat tax by making our own statement.\\" To this end, the band hung two upside-down American flags from their amplifiers. Seconds before they took the stage to perform \\"Bulls on Parade\\", stagehands were sent in to pull the flags down. Following the removal of the flags during the first performance, the band was approached by NBC officials and ordered to immediately leave the building. Upon hearing this, bassist Tim Commerford reportedly stormed Forbes' dressing room, throwing shreds from one of the torn-down flags. Morello said that members of the SNL cast and crew, whom he declined to name, \\"expressed solidarity with our actions, and a sense of shame that their show had censored the performance.\\" Since this incident, Rage Against the Machine has not appeared on Saturday Night Live again. =Donald Trump= Donald Trump's 2015 appearance invited protests. Business magnate and US president Donald Trump's second hosting appearance, in the midst of his 2016 presidential campaign, courted controversy and protests. Latino advocacy groups pressed NBC to cancel Trump's appearance, due to his remarks on Mexican immigration, while protestors picketed outside Trump Tower and 30 Rockefeller Plaza in the days preceding and of the show, holding \\"DUMP TRUMP\\" signs. That group created a petition to cancel Trump's hosting with over 500,000 signatures, delivering it to Michaels and NBCUniversal Chief Executive Steve Burke. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus issued a \\"statement of opposition\\" to Trump's appearance. The group DeportRacism.com offered $5,000 in cash to any audience member that would heckle Trump and call him a racist during his monologue. The show aired on November 7, 2015, and due to the equal-time rule, Trump only appeared for a total of twelve minutes. The notion of heckling was referenced in the show, when Larry David (who had guested earlier in the evening to play politician Bernie Sanders) called Trump a racist, but only to secure the $5,000. In the end, the episode received 9.3 million viewers‚Äîthe program's highest ratings in nearly four years‚Äîbut was panned by critics. NBC subsequently offered free airtime to Republican candidates who filed equal time requests. =Kanye West= On September 29, 2018, during the end credits, musical guest Kanye West, who wore a ‚ÄúMake America Great Again‚Äù hat, launched into a third performance with the song ‚ÄúGhost Town‚Äù featuring Kid Cudi and 070 Shake. Midway through the performance, NBC cut to commercial, as the show had reached the end of its allotted airtime. After finishing the performance, West began pontificating about the ‚Äúliberal media‚Äù attacking President Donald Trump and his own rumored 2020 presidential bid. This resulted in boos from the audience, as the cast stood off to the side of the stage and kept their heads down. The impromptu speech was captured in part by comedian Chris Rock. During the rant that was uploaded to Twitter by West's record producer, Mike Dean, West accused the cast and crew of bullying him about supporting Trump. Cast members Kenan Thompson and Pete Davidson weighed in on the performance with the former likening it to \\"hold[ing] people hostage\\" during an October 1 appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers, while the latter during the following episode's Weekend Update segment said that West was not told not to wear the hat, nevertheless wearing it throughout the week. Other A number of hosts and musical guests have been \\"banned\\" from appearing on the show again and there have been examples of other controversial goings-on within SNL. Examples of these are noted below. =Incidents= * On December 13, 1975, the show was ordered by NBC network officials to run the episode hosted by controversial comedian Richard Pryor on a five-second tape delay. Engineers at the show later said they did not run the delay because no one knew how to achieve the effect. However, the first edition of The Book of Lists, describing the broadcast, indicated that two words were deleted during the broadcast, although what was censored is not specified. * The December 15, 1979 episode featured three songs by musical guest David Bowie, concluding with a performance of \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\" which used a green screen effect to superimpose Bowie's head on the body of a marionette he operated while singing. Censors muted the lyric \\"other boys check you out\\" during the performance, but were unable to react in time when the song concluded with a large phallus repeatedly popping out of the marionette's pants. The episode was not edited further for rebroadcasts. * The episode of February 21, 1981, hosted by Dallas star Charlene Tilton, featured a parody of the famed \\"Who Shot J.R.?\\" story arc from the then-popular nighttime soap. During the show a plot line had cast member Charles Rocket and Tilton flirting while other cast members expressed jealousy, leading to Rocket being shot in the chest by a sniper in the middle of a sketch. In the show's closing moments, as cast members gathered with the host to say good night, Tilton asked Rocket how he felt about being shot. In character, Rocket replied \\"Oh man, it's the first time I've ever been shot in my life. I'd like to know who the fuck did it.\\" He attempted to explain it away as an extemporaneous exclamation. This later contributed to Rocket's dismissal from the show. During this same episode, musical guest Prince was thought to have sung the lyric \\"Fightin' war is such a fuckin' bore\\" during his performance of \\"Partyup\\", but it went largely unnoticed at the time, as censors either missed it or weren't sure whether he actually had said \\"fuckin'\\" or \\"funkin':. * A stand-up routine by Sam Kinison during the October 18, 1986 episode was edited for the West Coast telecast and later airings, replacing two sections of the routine with a silent image of the previous season's cast. The first cutaway occurred when Kinison encouraged the legalization of cannabis and said: \\"You can't get any more pot. If you give us back the pot, we'll forget about the crack.\\" The joke violated NBC policy of the time that all references to drugs must be negative. The second, longer cutaway occurred when Kinison made a joke about the Crucifixion. During rehearsal, Kinison had not performed the drug joke but he had performed, and been asked to remove, the Crucifixion joke. * In a December 5, 1992 \\"Wayne's World\\" sketch, the characters Wayne and Garth (portrayed by Mike Myers and Dana Carvey) made fun of Chelsea Clinton, daughter of then-President-elect Bill Clinton. Wayne noted that while \\"adolescence has been thus far unkind\\" to the then-twelve-year-old Chelsea, Garth opined that \\"she could turn into a babe in waiting.\\" First Lady Hillary Clinton was publicly critical of the jokes, and they were subsequently edited out of all repeats and syndication rebroadcasts of this sketch. \\"We felt, upon reflection, that if it was in any way hurtful, it wasn't worth it,\\" said executive producer Lorne Michaels. \\"She's a kid, a kid who didn't choose to be in public life.\\" Myers himself wrote a letter of apology to the White House. * The 13th episode of SNL 19th season, aired the weekend before Valentine's Day in 1994, featured a sketch in which host Alec Baldwin portrays a scoutmaster making overt sexual advances towards the boy scout character Canteen Boy (played by Adam Sandler). The sketch generated a considerable amount of complaints from viewers, who felt it was homophobic and trivialized pedophilia. Chicago Sun-Times columnist Richard Roeper stated that he received calls from his readers claiming they stopped watching the sketch before it finished, while the Boy Scouts of America said: \\"We see nothing funny about child molestation, and are surprised that this unfunny subject would be selected for a comedy sketch.\\" Baldwin said that NBC received 300,000 phone call complaints and lost seven affiliates due to the sketch, though this was proven false. Nonetheless, the sketch frequently appears in lists of the most controversial SNL moments, and reruns add a disclaimer that Sandler's character is 27 years old. * During an April 12, 1997 Weekend Update story about Tabitha Soren, anchor Norm Macdonald, a cast member who was no stranger to on-air controversies during his tenure at the Weekend Update desk, appeared to cough and choke momentarily, causing him to pause and then mutter live, \\"What the fuck was that?\\" The audience applauded, and Macdonald laughed the error away, saying at one point that he hoped everyone was enjoying \\"my farewell performance\\" and, in closing, \\"Maybe we'll see you next week\\". He was fired at the start of January 1998, partly because of this incident and partly (according to NBC's management, and disputed by much of the cast) due to a \\"drop in ratings and general reduction of quality.\\" Macdonald and others believed that the real reason for his dismissal was the inclusion of a series of jokes calling O. J. Simpson a murderer during and after his double murder trial in Los Angeles. NBC Entertainment president Don Ohlmeyer was good friends with Simpson, and had thrown a party for the jurors who acquitted Simpson after the trial. The jokes were written primarily by Macdonald and longtime SNL writer Jim Downey, who was fired from SNL outright at the same time. Downey was re-hired in 2000. Macdonald was replaced on Weekend Update by Colin Quinn, beginning on the January 10, 1998 episode. Macdonald's firing was widely criticized, most notably by comedian Chevy Chase, who was largely responsible for originating Weekend Update. Chase argued that Macdonald's \\"time in the chair [was] among the funniest and [most] well-written of all the Weekend Update stints\\".https://www.cinemablend.com/television/10-Most-Crucial-Casting- Changes-Saturday-Night-Live-History-43147.html The 10 Most Crucial Casting Changes In Saturday Night Live History by Mack Rawden 2013 * In March 1998, a Robert Smigel animated short film called Conspiracy Theory Rock, a parody of the show Schoolhouse Rock!, aired as part of the TV Funhouse segment. The scathingly political short accused big corporations including Time Warner, Disney, Fox, Westinghouse, and then-owner of NBC General Electric, of developing a media monopoly to manipulate public perception and conceal questionable actions. The clip aired only once as part of the original SNL episode and was removed from syndicated repeats, with Michaels explaining that it \\"wasn't funny\\". The clip was eventually released as part of the Saturday TV Funhouse compilation DVD in 2006. * While performing their single \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" on May 7, 2005, System of a Down's Daron Malakian exclaimed \\"fuck yeah\\". The band had previously refused to self-censor their performance, leading censors to mute \\"fuck\\" each time it was sung, but miss Malakian's impromptu yell. It was subsequently edited out of the West Coast telecast of the show. * The episode hosted by Rainn Wilson, aired on February 24, 2007, featured a sketch titled \\"Danny's Song\\", wherein bar patrons listen to the titular song and reminisce about inappropriate memories. A character played by Bill Hader says, \\"He loved this song. I remember we had this one great day at the park. We just had so much fun. He was running in the grass and chasing squirrels. They had this fountain and we threw pennies in it for hours. So great. It was the first day that I ever thought to myself: 'I have a dad. And not that I have a dad with Down's syndrome. He loved crayons.'\\" The skit prompted criticism from Jon Colman, the CEO of the National Down Syndrome Society, which led to the words \\"Down's syndrome\\" being bleeped in later rebroadcasts. * On September 26, 2009, Jenny Slate made her SNL debut in a \\"biker babes\\" sketch alongside Kristen Wiig and actress Megan Fox in which their characters repeatedly use the word \\"frickin'\\". In one instance Slate accidentally said \\"fuckin'\\" instead, which was dubbed over with \\"freakin'\\" for subsequent airings. Slate was 'pulled back' in subsequent episodes and fired from the show at the conclusion of the season. * On December 15, 2012, actor Samuel L. Jackson, appearing on the recurring Kenan Thompson sketch \\"What Up with That?\\" as a talk show guest whose segment was cut for time, exclaimed what sounded like the words \\"fuck\\" and \\"bullshit\\". Thompson ad-libbed in response, \\"C'mon, Sam, that costs money!\\" Jackson later claimed he had not said the full word \\"fuck\\" and that Thompson was supposed to cut off his second expletive. * On March 12, 2016, Ariana Grande uttered the word \\"shit\\" during her opening monologue. The profanity was \\"expected\\" to be edited out of the West Coast broadcast, but was not. * On November 12, 2016, host Dave Chappelle deliberately used the words \\"goddamn\\" and \\"nigger\\" throughout his monologue and in several sketches. Although NBC did not censor Chappelle, Raleigh affiliate WRAL-TV, which had only joined the network earlier in the year, did so, as it found airing profanity to be in violation of its own policy. * On February 4, 2017, host Kristen Stewart said that hosting the show was \\"the coolest fucking thing ever\\" during her opening monologue. Stewart realized her mistake, apologized and joked that she would never be invited back. She hosted again on November 2, 2019. * The episode hosted by Gal Gadot, aired on October 7, 2017, featured a sketch titled \\"Safelite AutoGlass\\". The sketch drew controversy for a scene in which a Safelite windshield repairman purposely breaks a customer's windshield in order to hit on the customer's 17-year-old daughter. The sketch was subsequently pulled from rebroadcasts and the Internet. Rebroadcasts replaced the sketch with a previously unaired sketch titled \\"The Last Fry\\". * On January 13, 2018, host Sam Rockwell accidentally said \\"you can't be this fucking stupid\\" while in character as a frustrated children's television host reminiscent of Mr. Wizard. In the same episode, Weekend Update co-anchor Colin Jost said the word \\"shithole\\" in reference to then-President Donald Trump's comments about \\"shithole countries\\" despite NBC asking him to say \\"s-hole.\\" Both incidents were censored for the West Coast broadcast of the show. * On November 3, 2018, cast member Pete Davidson said during his Weekend Update First Impressions segment on the 2018 Midterm Election candidates that Lieutenant Commander Dan Crenshaw looked like \\"a hitman in a porno movie.\\" Crenshaw himself made a cameo on the next episode's Weekend Update, in which Davidson apologized to him. * On September 12, 2019, the night before SNL planned to announce the three new cast members hired for the 45th season, several offensive remarks made by incoming cast member Shane Gillis were made public. Freelance comedy reporter Seth Simons posted clips, since removed from YouTube, of an episode of Matt and Shane's Secret Podcast from 2018 in which Gillis made racist and mocking remarks about Chinese people.A video of the podcast, removed before Gillis's hiring but reposted to Twitter, showed Gillis using racial slurs against Asian people, making derogatory references to the food they eat, and discussing his frustration with their inability to learn English, later referring to it as \\"good racism\\". Early in 2019, he called Democratic presidential nominee Andrew Yang a \\"Jew Chink\\". Gillis responded to the backlash with what Vox and The Huffington Post characterized as a non- apology. Four days later, on September 16, a spokesperson for Michaels announced that Gillis would be removed from the cast.https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/shane-gillis-at-saturday- night-live-racial-homophobic-slurs-podcast-1239506 =Banned performers= The following performers have been banned from either hosting or performing on Saturday Night Live mostly due to being badly rehearsed, going offscript (which Lorne Michaels reportedly hates), camera-mugging, not getting along with the cast and crew, or anything else that would be inappropriate. *On the October 29, 1977 episode, Charles Grodin was the host and during the week, he reportedly missed rehearsals and throughout the show, Grodin flubbed his lines, ruined sketches, and forgot the show was live. Grodin would be banned from ever hosting Saturday Night Live again. * On the December 17, 1977 episode hosted by Miskel Spillman (winner of the \\"Anyone Can Host\\" contest), Elvis Costello was the musical guest. Costello was slated to perform \\"Less Than Zero\\" due to pressure from his record company. Costello disagreed, and felt that the song, which was about British Union of Fascists leader Oswald Mosley, would not be understood by an American audience and was too low-key to make much impact. After roughly thirty seconds, Costello stopped his band, stating \\"I‚Äôm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but there‚Äôs no reason to do this song here.\\" The band then began to play \\"Radio Radio\\" instead. Costello was not invited back until 1989 and 1991. He parodied the incident on the 25th anniversary show by interrupting the Beastie Boys' performance of \\"Sabotage\\" which quickly morphed into a joint performance of \\"Radio Radio.\\" * On April 14, 1979, Milton Berle guest-hosted the program. Berle's long reputation for taking control of an entire television production‚Äîwhether invited to do so or not‚Äîwas a cause of major on-set stress. One of the show's writers, Rosie Shuster, described the rehearsals for the Berle SNL show, and the telecast, as \\"watching a comedy train accident in slow motion on a loop.\\" Upstaging, camera mugging, doing spit-takes, inserting old comedy bits, and climaxing the show with a maudlin performance of \\"September Song\\" complete with a pre-arranged standing ovation (something producer Lorne Michaels had never sanctioned) resulted in Berle being banned from hosting the show again. The episode was also barred from being rerun until surfacing in 2003, because Michaels thought it brought down the show's reputation.Best and Worst 'SNL' Hosts at xfinity.comcast.net, retrieved June 27, 2013. * Frank Zappa was banned after his 1978 episode for doing a \\"disastrous job of hosting the show\\", mugging for the camera and even announcing to the audience that he was reading from cue cards. * In 1982, Andy Kaufman proposed an audience vote to let him stay or force him off the show. The final tally of viewers calling in to \\"Keep Andy\\" came in at 169,186, while 195,544 voted to \\"Dump Andy.\\" * In 1982, Robert Blake was banned after taking a script, crumpling it up and throwing it into the face of writer Gary Kroeger. * In 1986, The Replacements were banned after they came out completely drunk during their performance of \\"Bastards of Young\\" and later appeared in each other's clothes during the second performance. However, Paul Westerberg later went solo and was allowed to appear. The band did not perform again on any NBC television program until 2014, when they appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. * Steven Seagal was banned after his hosting stint in 1991 for being the \\"worst host ever\\" (according to SNL creator and producer Lorne Michaels), as well as being difficult to work with, where he did not cooperate with the cast and crew. In a later episode hosted by Nicolas Cage, Lorne Michaels got in a jab at Seagal. When Cage lamented during his monologue that the audience might think he's the biggest jerk who's ever been on the show, Michaels responded \\"No, no. That would be Steven Seagal.\\" * A portion of Martin Lawrence's February 19, 1994, monologue concerning feminine hygiene has been removed from all repeats and replaced with a voice-over (writer Jim Downey) and intertitles stating that the excised portion \\"...was a frank and lively presentation, and nearly cost us all our jobs.\\" Lawrence also made references to genitalia when he talked about the John and Lorena Bobbitt incident. This led to Lawrence being subsequently banned from ever hosting, appearing, or even being mentioned on the show, although Leslie Jones mentioned his show Martin during a 2016 Weekend Update segment. * In 2003, Adrien Brody ad-libbed an introduction to musical guest Sean Paul while wearing fake dreadlocks and speaking in fake Jamaican Patois for 45 seconds, prompting Michaels to ban him for this action and to say that Brody's performance was possibly racist. =Plagiarism= * The sketch \\"O'Callahan & Son Pub\\", aired March 18, 1995 episode hosted by Paul Reiser, was entirely lifted from a standup routine by comedian Rick Shapiro by cast member/writer Jay Mohr. During rehearsal three weeks later, Mohr was brought to Michaels and shown a tape of Shapiro's act. Mohr denied any knowledge of Shapiro or his act at the time, but later admitted in his memoir that he had stolen the sketch word for word from Shapiro's work. Shapiro and his manager sued the show and gained an undisclosed settlement which included the removal of the sketch from all reruns of the show. * \\"Ladies Who Lunch\\", a sketch aired on the September 25, 2010 episode hosted by Amy Poehler, was deemed similar to the Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! segment \\"Tiny Hats\\". Both Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim jokingly tweeted links to the video. Heidecker told Vulture that \\"I watched it this morning, and found it to be very similar to our sketch, surprisingly similar,\\" while noting it also could have been coincidental. * The sketch \\"River Sisters\\", aired on the October 4, 2014 episode hosted by Sarah Silverman, was accused of plagiarizing \\"Rollin'\\", a similar sketch performed by the Los Angeles improvisation group the Groundlings. * A May 9, 2015 sketch showed a contestant on a Win, Lose or Draw-style game show panicking at being asked to draw the Muslim prophet Muhammad. Viewers compared the sketch to a \\"strikingly similar\\" January 2015 sketch on the Canadian sketch comedy series This Hour Has 22 Minutes, igniting allegations of plagiarism. * In a 2017 episode hosted by Louis C.K., a sketch aired in which a man, played by C.K., hires a clown (Bobby Moynihan) to perform at a birthday party at which he is the sole audience member. Comedian Tig Notaro accused the show's writers of plagiarizing her short film Clown Service. Notaro further claimed that a writer who was aware of Clown Service worked on Birthday Clown, and that Notaro and C.K. had not spoken for over a year. * In the November 2018 episode hosted by Jonah Hill, a sketch titled, \\"America's Got Talent: Wait, They're Good?\\" was aired. Several fans pointed out the similarities with the performance and a YouTube video posted by comedian Gus Johnson titled, \\"Every Episode Of America's Got Talent\\" and leveled accusations of plagiarism at the show. Johnson himself said that he considered it a coincidence and that he did not feel SNL intended to plagiarize him. In a video made in response, he stated \\"I really don't even think that SNL did anything wrong; they probably didn't even see my stupid video anyway. I mean, you can't keep up with all the memes on the internet.\\" * The founders of the sketch comedy troupe Temple Horses alleged that two sketches from Season 44, \\"The Pumpkin Patch\\" from the October 13, 2018 episode hosted by Awkwafina and \\"Pound Puppy\\" from the February 16, 2019 episode hosted by Don Cheadle, were plagiarized from their own earlier sketches \\"Pet Blinders\\" and \\"Not Trying to Fuck This Pumpkin,\\" uploaded to YouTube in 2011 and 2014 respectively. In a statement to Variety, Ryan Hoffman said \\"Imagine, one day you come home and it looks like somebody's robbed your house, what do you want from that situation? We feel like somebody took our stuff, and this isn't the kind of thing where you can just get it back or call your insurance company to have it replaced, so at this point we're just speaking out about it.\\" References Bibliography : : : : : : Further reading : Category:Saturday Night Live Saturday Night Live incidents, List of ","title":"List of Saturday Night Live incidents"},{"id":"45176993","text":"Thentu Lakshmu Naidu (Raja) is an Indian politician.

Background  In contrast to Danielsen's previous solo album Enjoy the Process, which featured only the singer along with his acoustic guitar, Food Chain featured a full band. In October 2014, prior to the release of the EP, the singer released \\"Rescue Me\\", the second song from the album via Revolver Magazine. The singer stated that he selected the tune, because \\"it‚Äôs a very powerful song that a lot of people can relate to in this day and age\\", going on to say that \\"We live in an overly medicated society, and we all have people close to us being affected\\".  Touring  In October and November 2014, the vocalist toured West Virginia along with the Midwestern and south central United States to promote the EP.

Born in North York, Ontario, he started high school at St. Edmund Campion Secondary School in Brampton before attending three different schools in the United States, including Notre Dame Preparatory School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. A former University of Nevada-Las Vegas (UNLV) signee, he began playing for Saint Louis at the college level, but after receiving limited playing time, he transferred to Grand Canyon, where he earned all-conference honors. After leaving college, Glaze was drafted by the Delaware 87ers of the NBA Development League but was released without playing any games. He made his professional debut in the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional, the top professional league in Mexico, for Correcaminos and also played a season with the Caballeros de Culiac√°n in the Circuito de Baloncesto de la Costa del Pac√≠fico. In November 2017, Glaze was signed by the St. John's Edge, an expansion team in NBL Canada. He averaged 7.3 points and 6.1 rebounds per game for the Edge, helping the team to the Central Division finals.  High school career  In his freshman basketball season, Glaze attended St. Edmund Campion Secondary School in Brampton, Ontario. For the following two years, he transferred to St. John's Catholic Prep in Buckeystown, Maryland, where he played the power forward position for the Vikings. As a junior at the Mid-Atlantic Invitational at St. Maria Goretti High School in November 2008, Glaze was named tournament most valuable player (MVP) and earned all-tournament honors as his team won the championship. On February 9, 2009, he led all scorers with 31 points to help defeat McDonogh School. By the end of the season, he was averaging 18 points and 8 rebounds per game, en route to The Gazette Player of the Year accolades. As a junior, Glaze moved to Proctor Academy in Andover, New Hampshire, closing the season with averages of about 20 points and 13 rebounds per game. At the time, Rivals.com ranked him as the 83rd-best prospect in his class and among the top-20 power forwards. Glaze played his final season at the high school level for Notre Dame Preparatory School in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. On November 11, 2010, he signed a letter of intent to play for the UNLV Runnin' Rebels in college, turning down offers from Akron, South Florida, and West Virginia. However, in April 2011, after the Rebels lost head coach Lon Kruger, Glaze requested release from his UNLV commitment. On August 2, 2011, he signed with the Saint Louis Billikens to play under coach Rick Majerus.  College career  For the 2011‚Äì2012 season, Glaze played in a mere 9 games as reserve power forward for the Billikens. Against Alabama State, he played 10 minutes while recording 2 points, 3 rebounds, and an assist. Glaze dislocated his shoulder in November 2012 after diving for a loose ball against Texas A&M; and missed the next five games. Glaze played in 25 games, a sizable increase in playing time, and had 20 starts. Glaze's best game came against conference foe Duquesne where he tallied 8 points, 10 rebounds, and 2 steals. The 2012‚Äì13 Saint Louis Billikens men's basketball team went 28‚Äì7 and earned the Billikens a 4 seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they eventually lost in the 3rd Round to 12th seeded Oregon. He averaged 3.1 points and 2.6 rebounds per game as a sophomore. Glaze (front) with Saint Louis at the 2013 NCAA Tournament Glaze played in all 34 games as a junior while making 6 starts for the Billikens. In the team's opener, Glaze scored 16 points on 7 of 7 shooting and grabbed 10 rebounds while the Billikens defeated Southeast Missouri State 87‚Äì64. Glaze followed up this career game with another notable performance against Southern Illinois Edwardsville where he scored 9 points, tallied 14 rebounds, and dished out an assist. After these two career games, Glaze continued to play well and had another strong performance with 14 points in a 67‚Äì65 win over Valparaiso on December 7. Glaze logged few minutes during conference play. The Billikens, however, went on a winning streak which eventually placed them in the AP Poll as high as #10. St. Louis ended up being a 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament, where the Billikens won in one of the greatest comebacks in NCAA Tournament history against North Carolina State, rallying from 14 down to win in OT. He averaged 3.8 points and 4.5 rebounds as a junior in 12.9 minutes per game. Even though his numbers weren't impressive, Glaze specialized in activities that did not show up on box scores such as setting screens, boxing out on rebounds, and playing strong defense. Glaze came into the 2014‚Äì15 season expecting to be in the starting lineup and play major minutes for the Billikens due to graduating players. However, before the season started Glaze re-injured his shoulder in practice and was officially ruled out for a few weeks. He ended up having to sit out the entire season due to surgery on that shoulder. On May 11, Glaze officially transferred to Grand Canyon University. He chose the Antelopes over offers from Wyoming and New Mexico and did not need to sit out a year, as he was a graduate transfer. Glaze scored a career- high 29 points in a 108‚Äì104 loss to Omaha on December 13, 2015. In his only season at Grand Canyon, he finished eighth in the Western Athletic Conference in scoring with 14.0 points per game, second in rebounding with 8.8 per game, and first in field goal percentage with 59.6 percent. Glaze led the team to a 27‚Äì7 record and earned the 2016 Riley Wallace Award for best college basketball transfer. He was also named second team National Association of Basketball Coaches All-Region 6 and second team All-WAC. Glaze received the Most Valuable Player award in the first John McLendon Classic during the first-round CollegeInsider.com Tournament game. Professional career Glaze (third from right) during a timeout with the St. John's Edge After graduation, Glaze worked out with the Philadelphia 76ers in anticipation for the 2016 NBA draft. He was drafted by their D-League affiliate the Delaware 87ers with the seventh pick of the third round in the 2016 NBA Development League Draft. He was one of four WAC players taken in the D-League draft. However, he never played for the 87ers and instead debuted for Correcaminos of the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional in Mexico. Glaze averaged 16 points, 12.3 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game. He led the league in rebounding but Correcaminos, which is owned by the Autonomous University of Tamaulipas, finished last in league standings. In March 2017 Glaze signed with the Caballeros de Culiac√°n of the Circuito de Baloncesto de la Costa del Pac√≠fico, another league in Mexico. In November 2017, Glaze was signed by the St. John's Edge, an expansion team in NBL Canada. He was dominant in the early season, contributing 19 points and 20 rebounds against the Island Storm, and posting 18 points and 17 rebounds the following game versus the Halifax Hurricanes. Glaze missed four games in November due to representing Canada in qualification matches for the FIBA Basketball World Cup. In a game versus the London Lightning on March 3, 2018, Glaze left the bench during a melee in which Carl English was tripped up. Glaze was ejected and was suspended the following game by the league. In their first season in play, the Edge reached the Central Division finals, losing to the London Lightning. He averaged 7.3 points and 6.1 rebounds per game for the Edge, shooting 60 percent on field goals. Glaze was named to the Third Team All-Canadian. In September 2018, Glaze's rights were traded by the St. John's Edge to the Windsor Express in exchange for Maurice Jones. Days later, his rights were traded to the Sudbury Five for those of Juan Pattillo. On October 12, 2018, Glaze signed with the Five. He averaged 13.9 points and 11.6 rebounds per game in 16 games. In January 2019, Glaze signed with Colegio Los Leones de Quilpu√© of the Liga Nacional de B√°squetbol de Chile.

In 19 games he averaged 10.8 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 2.4 assists per game. Glaze briefly played for Capitanes de Ciudad de M√©xico of the Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional, where in two games he averaged 29 points, eight rebounds, two steals, and 1.5 assists per game.

Life Maximilian grew up with his older brother, Joachim M√∂rlin, as the sons of Jodok M√∂rlin ( Jodocus Morlinus, ca. 1490 ‚Äì 1550 ), the Professor of Philosophy at the University of Wittenberg. After a harsh upbringing, when he learned the trade of a tailor, he switched to the profession of a scholar. Like his brother, he studied at Wittenberg in 1533 and came under the influence of Martin Luther and especially Philipp Melanchthon. From 1539, he was the pastor in Pegau and Zeitz and, after 1543, in Schalkau. On the recommendation of his teacher, he came to Coburg in 1544 as a court preacher ( Hofprediger ) and visited the city‚Äôs churches and schools on the behalf of the Duke of Saxony. After Maximilian graduated in 1546 under Caspar Cruciger the Elder at Wittenberg to the rank of Doctor, he was appointed as a Superintendent. In the theological debates of the times, he was at first on the side of Matthias Flacius. He pursued the condemnation of Justus Menius, participated in the Colloquy of Worms in 1557 and wrote with and Johann St√∂ssel the Weimarer Konfutationsbuch [ the Weimarer Book of Refutations ], which was mandatory for the Lutheran churches throughout Thuringia. The Duke of Saxony, John Frederick the Middle, also took him to Heidelberg to prevent his father-in-law, Frederick III the Pious, the Elector Palatinate of the Rhine, from going over to the Reformed side. The Heidelberger Abendmahlsgespr√§ch [ Heidelberger Discussion of the Lord‚Äôs Supper ], with which M√∂rlin was involved on 3 and 4 July 1560, remained unsuccessful. However, from the side of the Radicals, Flacius struck, distancing M√∂rlin from the Philippists. He fought against Andreas Osiander and helped in 1556 to enforce the Reformation to the Margraviate of Baden-Durlach on the behalf of its ruler, Charles II. As the Spiritual Assessor for the Consistory of Weimar, he pleaded in 1561 for peace with the terms of the mediating theologian Melanchthon. In Jena, he served in 1564 as the Pro- Chancellor and Vice-Dean in the first program for theological doctorates and upgraded St√∂ssel‚Äôs academic degree from Magister to Doctor. The next Duke of Saxony, John William, himself the supporter of Flacius, expelled M√∂rlin from the Duchy in 1569. A year later, M√∂rlin was appointed to Dillenburg and later Siegen, where he represented his side against the Reformed tendencies of the ruler, the Count of Nassau-Dillenburg, John VI, but without success. In 1573, he returned from Siegen to Coburg, where he was restored to his old offices. He dismissed the Gnesio-Lutherans and used his influence to add to the Formula Concordiae [ Formula of Concord ] and to contend with its effects. M√∂rlin gained importance as a preacher and the representative of church administrators. In 1581, he married for the second time. He was survived by twelve sons.

It has been found to act as a potent and selective small-molecule agonist of the tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) (Kd ‚âà 320 nM), the main signaling receptor of the neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). 7,8-DHF is both orally bioavailable and able to penetrate the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. A prodrug of 7,8-DHF with greatly improved potency and pharmacokinetics, R13 (and, formerly, R7), is under development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. 7,8-DHF has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in animal models of a variety of central nervous system disorders, including depression, Alzheimer's disease, cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury, cerebral ischemia, fragile X syndrome, and Rett syndrome. 7,8-DHF also shows efficacy in animal models of age-associated cognitive impairment and enhances memory consolidation and emotional learning in healthy rodents. In addition, 7,8-DHF possesses powerful antioxidant activity independent of its actions on the TrkB receptor, and protects against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, 6-hydroxydopamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, and oxidative stress- induced genotoxicity. It was also found to block methamphetamine-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, an effect which, in contrast to the preceding, was found to be TrkB-dependent. In 2017, evidence was published suggesting that 7,8-DHF and various other reported small-molecule TrkB agonists might not actually be direct agonists of the TrkB and might be mediating their observed effects by other means. 7,8-DHF has been found to act as a weak aromatase inhibitor in vitro (Ki = 10 ŒºM), though there is evidence to suggest that this might not be the case in vivo. In addition, it has been found to inhibit aldehyde dehydrogenase and estrogen sulfotransferase in vitro (Ki = 35 ŒºM and 1‚Äì3 ŒºM, respectively), though similarly to the case of aromatase, these activities have not yet been confirmed in vivo. Unlike many other flavonoids, 7,8-DHF does not show any inhibitory activity on 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. 7,8-DHF has also been observed to possess in vitro antiestrogenic effects at very high concentrations (Ki = 50 ŒºM). A variety of close structural analogues of 7,8-DHF have also been found to act as TrkB agonists in vitro, including diosmetin (5,7,3'-trihydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone), norwogonin (5,7,8-trihydroxyflavone), 4'-dimethylamino-7,8-dihydroxyflavone (4'-DMA-7,8-DHF), 7,8,3'-trihydroxyflavone, 7,3'-dihydroxyflavone, 7,8,2'-trihydroxyflavone, 3,7,8,2'-tetrahydroxyflavone, and 3,7-dihydroxyflavone. The highly hydroxylated analogue gossypetin (3,5,7,8,3',4'-hexahydroxyflavone), conversely, appears to be an antagonist of TrkB in vitro.

It was designed by Frank Gibson Costello and built by Brisbane City Council. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 May 2005.  History  The Brisbane City Council built the concrete shelter at Albert Park (north) as an air raid shelter in 1942. On 7 December 1941, the United States of America entered World War Two following the bombing of the American fleet at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii by Japanese carrier-borne aircraft. England and its Commonwealth had been at war with Germany since September 1939, but now the war was truly global. The Japanese first bombed Darwin on 19 February 1942 and 14,000 Australians were taken prisoner following the fall of Singapore. Plans to defend Australia from an anticipated Japanese invasion and to use Queensland as a support base for the conduct of the Pacific war were implemented quickly. Australian and American personnel poured into Queensland and urgently required a wide range of new buildings and facilities. The population of Brisbane swelled dramatically. As it was the major city in Queensland, and the most northerly major population centre in Australia, military planning headquarters were set up in Brisbane, as were a number of important maintenance, communication, and supply facilities. General Douglas MacArthur, Commander in Chief of the Allied Forces, Southwest Pacific, was based in the AMP building at the corner of Queen Street and Edward Street in Brisbane, and General Sir Thomas Blamey, Commander in Chief of the Australian Forces, used the recently constructed University of Queensland buildings at St Lucia. Brisbane was obviously a strategic target for bombing, and rapid action had to be taken to protect the population in the event of air raids. The demand on materials, services and labour was enormous and military projects took precedence in their allocation. Heavy Anti-Aircraft batteries were built at Victoria Park, Hendra, Pinkenba, Fort Lytton, Hemmant and Balmoral, and coastal artillery batteries were established on Bribie and Moreton Islands. Before the war, Queensland had a small population and no heavy manufacturing industries. To help overcome these problems, some buildings were prefabricated and standard designs for many structures were used. Designs took into account the scarcity of skilled labour and of some materials. The Brisbane City Council took responsibility for Air Raid Precautions activities, including establishing an Air Raid Warden system, firefighting systems and constructing air raid shelters. Aboveground salt water pipes were laid along city streets to aid in firefighting. On Christmas Eve, 1941, each Australian State's Emergency Committee issued instructions for government, private employers and private households to immediately start building shelters. Slit trenches were built in parks and schoolyards, windows were taped, and brownouts were applied to buildings. In the Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1, gazetted 23 December 1941, Premier William Forgan Smith, with powers conferred by Regulation 35a, National Security (General) Regulations, ordered the Brisbane City Council to construct 200 public surface shelters in the city area. Work had already started on 15 December, and later another 75 shelters were ordered. However, only 235 air raid shelters were constructed, the building programme being 90% complete by June 1942. In addition, around three kilometres of covered trenches were constructed in public parks, in 13 projects, including of concrete-pipe covered trench in the City Botanic Gardens, and of the same in Victoria Park. It was believed that one person could be accommodated by each foot of trench. In addition to the public shelters, the Brisbane City Council also constructed shelters for leased wharves and council properties, including at the Stanley Wharf, Circular Quay Wharves 2,3 and 4, Norman Wharf, and Musgrave Wharf. Shelters were built under the Story Bridge, for Kangaroo Point shipbuilding workers, and five shelters were constructed on behalf of the Bureau of Industry at the Howard Smith Wharves. The Protection of Persons and Property Order No.1 was applied statewide, and outside Brisbane another 24 Local Authorities in Queensland's coastal areas were ordered to produce surface or trench shelters for the public, to be built according to the Air Raid Shelter Code laid down in the Second Schedule of Order No.1. Initially, 20 of the Local Authorities were expected to construct a minimum total of 133 surface shelters, which were supposed to be able to withstand the blast of a 500-pound bomb bursting away. Four other Local Authorities would only build trenches. However, after plans were amended, 23 Local Authorities outside Brisbane, excluding Thursday Island, ended up possessing a total of 129 public shelters: 123 surface and six underground. This effort had cost . Where Local Authorities were unwilling or unable to build the required number of code-compliant shelters, in some cases because they had already begun erecting other shelters, the Department of Public Works became responsible for the shelters' construction. However, this led to problems when the Department tried to recoup half of the cost from the Local Authorities in question. Townsville, Toowoomba, Gladstone, and Ayr denied any liability for costs, and a Bill had to be passed in December 1942 to force their compliance. The Ayr Shire Council had claimed that the shelters would be death traps during an air raid. Of the 235 surface shelters built in Brisbane for the public, 21 survive and are still owned by the Brisbane City Council. One of the shelters, on Queens Wharf Road, is a site-specific \\"special\\" variation of the standard pillbox design. It is listed in the Queensland Heritage Register as part of the entry for the porphyry retaining wall on William Street. The other 20 public shelters owned by the Brisbane City Council can be divided into three types of pillbox intended for conversion after the war: \\"park\\", \\"bus\\", and \\"bus (stone)\\". They were designed to serve as structures such as bus waiting shelters or shade structures for parks, with some or all of the perimeter blast walls to be removed, leaving the concrete slab roof, floor slab and piers. The reusable pillboxes were designed to hold 70 people, as were the non- reusable standard pillboxes. F.G. Costello, Brisbane City Council City Architect between 1941 and 1952, was responsible for the design of the surface air raid shelters, and his variants of the standard pillbox were designed to provide a post-war utility for at least part of the Council's shelter building programme. In an address delivered to the Constitutional Club in Brisbane on February 1942, Costello noted that \\"if the emergency for their use does not arise ...(unused shelters)... remain in brick and concrete, in many cases having no further value and being a possible source of nuisance\\". He added that \\"I can assure you that wherever it is possible, without sacrificing the primary requirements of shelter from air attack, I have endeavoured in our Council buildings to so plan the shelters that they will fit into schemes of improvement which we hope will proceed immediately after the war\\". Costello's work was characterised by the use of an architectural language inspired by the modern movement in architecture. This movement pursued the rational use of modern materials and principles of functionalist planning and established a visual aesthetic largely inspired by the machine. It was part of an architecture employing the language of vertical and horizontal volumes and planes, floating flat roofs, masses set against voids and monumentality. Though modest in scale and form, the design of the shelters is characteristic of work in this idiom. The reusable shelters were often sited under fig trees, to aid in camouflage. The first of Costello's reusable designs is the pillbox with double- cantilevered roof slab, or \\"park\\" type shelter. In an original list of all the shelters constructed by the Brisbane City Council, these were simply labelled as \\"cantilever\\". They had four central piers supporting the roof slab, which allowed for the removal of the four blast walls after the war. There was an entrance at each end of the front wall, where an internal wall extended into the shelter. If the walls were made of brick, the shelter's dimension was by by high, and if concrete was used the dimensions were by by high. The difference was due to the fact that the brick walls finished in line with the top of the roof slab, covering the fascia, whereas the concrete walls finished at the soffit of the roof slab, flush with the fascia. The minimum wall thickness for brick was set at 13.5\\", and 12\\" for concrete. The roof slab was intended to have at least four inches of concrete. Of the 37 reusable shelters listed as being of the park type only 17 survive: one at Hefferan Park in Annerley; two at Albert Park; two at Wickham Park; one in Buranda Playground in Woolloongabba; two in Raymond Park in Kangaroo Point; and one each at Kelvin Grove, Morningside, Nundah, Stones Corner, and Windsor. Four other shelters stand on East Street and Wickham Street in Fortitude Valley. Most are used as simple park shelters, as intended, but the shelter at Nundah has been modified as a toilet block, and the shelter at Kelvin Grove is used as a bus shelter (as distinct from those shelters in the next category, which were specifically designed as \\"bus\\" type shelters). About half of the surviving park shelters had concrete blast walls, while half used brick. The second design was the pillbox with single-cantilevered roof slab, or \\"bus\\" type shelter, as it was called in the original Brisbane City Council list. These were designed so that the three brick blast walls could be removed after the war, leaving a concrete back wall and five brick piers at the front. Again, entrances were at each end of the front wall. Of the 19 \\"bus\\" types listed only two survive, at Newmarket and Newstead. The third design was also a \\"bus\\" type shelter, but it was built with a stone rear wall, instead of concrete, and six stone piers were later added, instead of five brick piers. The three brick blast walls could be removed as normal. Two of these \\"colonnade\\" types were built ‚Äî referred to in the Brisbane City Council list as \\"bus (stone)\\"‚Äî and only one survives, at King Edward Park. Most of the Brisbane structures built for the war were removed at the end of World War Two. The saltwater mains, slit trenches, and sirens disappeared, as did the many standard pillboxes that had stood in the middle of the streets of the Central Business District. 156 standard pillboxes were built, but none of the surviving public shelters in Brisbane City Council ownership are of that design. Of the 21 special shelters, only the one on Queens Wharf Road survives. However, of Costello's 58 reusable public surface shelters, 20 have survived; the removal of their blast walls, as planned, had given them a renewed purpose. The worker's shelters at the Story Bridge Hotel and Howard Smith Wharves also still exist. The blast walls of the air raid shelter at Albert Park (North) were removed according to plan after World War Two. The floor slab has been covered with bitumen to form the surrounding footpath.  Description  Albert Park (North) Air Raid Shelter, 2015 The Albert Park (North) air raid shelter is a rectangular concrete structure comprising a heavy floor slab, which is covered with bitumen, and a flat roof supported by concrete piers. The original floor slab is still evident through the bitumen cover. The shelter is unpainted, and the soffit shows evidence of hasty removal of the blast walls; some reinforcing steel is visible protruding downwards. It stands on the footpath to the northeast corner of Albert Park with the canopies of large trees overhanging the shelter.  Heritage listing  Albert Park (North) air raid shelter was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 31 May 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Albert Park (north) air raid shelter is important as a part of the Air Raid Precaution activities that were implemented for the defence of Brisbane during World War Two. Designed to afford protection to the civilian population of Brisbane in the event of air raid attacks or other emergencies, the air raid shelter located on the footpath to the north-east corner of Albert Park is important in demonstrating the impact of World War Two on the civilian population of Brisbane. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. Although many air raid shelters were constructed during World War Two in Queensland, comparatively few survive. Also, there are not many types of structures built by the Brisbane City Council during World War Two, for wartime purposes, which survive. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The shelter's solid construction, rectangular shape, and its siting near a population concentration, demonstrate the principal characteristics of a World War Two Brisbane public air raid shelter. The place is important in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period. The Albert Park (north) air raid shelter, now used as a shade shelter, demonstrates the secondary uses that were part of the original design intention. The shelter is a durable example of innovative design and use of concrete technology during World War Two. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The air raid shelter is important as an example of the wartime work of the City Architect's Office and particularly the work of City Architect F.G. Costello.

Its full and political correct name is Mieterinnen- und Mieterverband. Important political signals by the Swiss establishment occurred in the 1990s as the tenancy law was introduced, and the association developed into a consumer organization, focussed to support tenants, such as housing and rent terminations. As Switzerland is still a country of tenants of well over 60% of the population, now the goals are to lower rents, demand for more cooperative living room, and to take measures against the housing shortage. On 15 January 2015, the Swiss tenant association celebrated its 100th anniversary.  History  = Foundation = Kratzquartier buildings in Z√ºrich in 1885. Hardau accommodation high-rise 'silos' of the 1960s in the Limmat Valley in Z√ºrich as seen from K√§ferberg. The first tenant organizations in Switzerland were founded in Basel and Z√ºrich due to large housing shortage in 1891. In addition, the foundation was a response to the Swiss homeowners associations that was established at the same time. An important basis of the then tenanant organizations provided the so-called Wohungsenquenten beginning in 1889, which documented the catastrophic living conditions in urban workers' quarters. In 1915 the cantonal tenant association of Geneva called a Swiss tenant congress in Biel/Bienne, where the Swiss tenants association was founded, and its central board was based in Z√ºrich. For the association's activities, the work in the cities and regions of the present 27 sections is still eminent. = Later decades = Mieterverband as the today's tenant association was established in 1915, as stuffy and crowded housing, hygiene issues and the fight against diseases in the tenements in Basel and Z√ºrich that was then to compare with present days slums, thus the policy measures forced to become mandatory, basing on the cantonal associations that were established before in Basel and Z√ºrich. First formulated objectives were the demands to improve the hygiene significantly. In the early years, these claims were made using a distinct class struggle against the 'class of landlords', but in the following decades political means were postulated much more moderate.  Goals  = Early days = Since the beginning, an effective protection of tenants and tenant-friendly rental law are the central concerns. As concrete goals, the establishment of state and cooperative housing association and cooperatives, the political work against the 'land lords', and the establishment of state conciliation and control bodies. These included in the 1930s to ensure an equitable distribution of costs, such as for public lighting and remediation costs, and of fightloosening attempts by the tenant protection legislation in the 1970s. The tenant association demanded in subsequent years, the Swiss tenants to collective rent reduction requests in response to the mortgage rates in the 1990s. = Present days = A \\"right to housing\\" is still today not integrated in the Swiss Federal Constitution. So in 1970 an initiative was narrowly rejected. Squatting the predominantly non-parliamentary Mietbewegung in the 1980s and 1990s, led to tensions in some sections. The MV tries furthermore by parliamentary initiatives and federal popular initiatives to establish an effective protection of tenants in the Federal Constitution on the political level. It primarily works with unions and progressive parties. So in 1982 filed \\"Tenant Protection Initiative\\" in favor of a direct counter- proposal by the Federal Council was withdrawn, which was adopted in 1986. Remarkably enough, only in 1990 a tenancy termination and price protection was introduced. The demand for market rent by the 'historical class enemy', was answered by the popular initiative \\"Ja zu fairen Mieten\\" (Yes to fair rents) in 1997, which was rejected in the traditional conservative Switzerland in 2003, as well as a landlord friendly amendment to the Obligationenrecht, the code of obligations laws, by the Swiss voters in 2004. To date, very important is the free legal assistanceand legal protection against arbitration authorities and courts.

Following the U.S. invasion of Grenada and the overthrow of the revolutionary government, the Parliament of Grenada enacted a 1985 law which confirmed the 1979 act of abolition. Although the 1979 law may not have been constitutional (in that it purported to amend the constitution without enacting a law by a two-thirds parliamentary majority), the 1985 law was passed with a two-thirds majority and thus adhered to the procedure for amending the constitution. Thus, the JCPC held that appeals to it from Grenada had been legitimately abolished as of 21 February 1985. Since Mitchell and the 18 other appellants had filed their appeal in July 1985, the JCPC was not entitled to hear their appeals. In 1991, Grenada re-established appeals to the JCPC.

At issue was whether the police could request subscriber information associated with an IP address from an Internet service provider, on a voluntary basis under the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act,Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, SC 2000, c 5. and without prior judicial authorisation. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the request for internet subscriber information infringed the Charter's guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure.  Background  The appellant, Matthew David Spencer, used LimeWire to download child pornography onto a computer belonging to his sister, with whom he lived, and inadvertently shared it publicly. A member of the Saskatoon Police Service, using software to track worldwide child pornography file sharing, found Spencer's IP address among the results. Police investigators suspected the IP address to belong to a Shaw Communications customer in Saskatoon, although they did not know the identity or precise location of the customer to whom the IP address belonged. Without a production order or judicial authorization, police investigators made a written request to Shaw for the subscriber information linked to the IP address in question. Shaw voluntarily complied, turning over records including the name and address of the user associated with the IP address. The police used this information to lawfully obtain a search warrant for Spencer's sister's house, where they found several child pornography photos and videos. Spencer was arrested and charged with two criminal offences: possession of child pornography, contrary to section 163.1(4) of the Criminal Code, and distribution of child pornography, contrary to section 163.1(3) of the Criminal Code.Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 163.1.  The courts below  =Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench= Spencer was tried before the Court of Queen's Bench for Saskatchewan. At a pre-trial application, he argued that the way the police obtained his subscriber information was an unconstitutional search, violating section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. On the merits of the charges, he argued that he did not knowingly share the child pornography because he did not know how LimeWire sharing worked. Spencer moved for the evidence to be excluded under section 24(2) of the Charter. In response, the Crown argued that Shaw's voluntary disclosure of Spencer's subscriber information was authorized by section 7(3)(c.1)(ii) of PIPEDA, which allows an organization to disclose personal information to a government institution that has \\"identified its lawful authority to obtain the information and indicated that the disclosure is requested for the purpose of... carrying out an investigation relating to the enforcement of any... law or gathering intelligence for the purpose of enforcing any... law\\". The trial judge dismissed Spencer's Charter application, finding that the police's request for Spencer's subscriber information was not a search for the purposes of section 8.R v Spencer, 2009 SKQB 341, paras 17, 18, 19. At trial, the trial judge convicted Spencer of possession of child pornography. However, he acquitted Spencer of distribution of child pornography, holding that offence required some \\"positive step or action\\" to distribute the materialsR v Spencer, 2011 SKCA 144, paras 49‚Äì50. and that the mens rea had not been established. =Saskatchewan Court of Appeal= Spencer appealed the conviction on the possession charge to the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal, while the Crown appealed the acquittal on the distribution charge. The Court of Appeal unanimously upheld the possession conviction, agreeing with the trial judge that the way the police obtained the IP information was not an unreasonable search and did not violate the Charter.R v Spencer, 2011 SKCA 144, para 47. The Court therefore dismissed Spencer's appeal on this charge. On the second issue, the acquittal on the charge of distributing child pornography, the Court allowed the Crown appeal. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had erred by holding that the offence required proof of a \\"positive step\\" to distribute the child pornography. The Court therefore set aside the acquittal and ordered a new trial on the distribution charge.R v Spencer, 2011 SKCA 144, paras 81, 95. Spencer then appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  Judgment of the SCC  The Supreme Court dismissed Spencer's appeal. However, the Supreme Court's decision varied from the Court of Appeal's on several counts. Cromwell J, writing for a unanimous Court, held that law enforcement's obtainment of Spencer's subscriber information was a search for the purposes of section 8. Spencer was found to have a reasonable expectation of privacy in his subscriber information, a decision reached by weighing the Tessling factors. First, the Court took a \\"broad and functional approach\\"SCC, par. 26 by determining the subject matter of the search to be not merely Spencer's name and address but the identity of an Internet user. Second, the Court found that the nature of Spencer's privacy interest in subscriber information relating to a computer used privately was primarily an informational one, and set out three key elements of informational privacy: privacy as secrecy, privacy as control, and privacy as anonymity.SCC, par. 38 The Court found anonymity to be particularly important in an online context, where subscriber information \\"may implicate privacy interests relating not simply to the person‚Äôs name or address but to his or her identity as the source, possessor or user of that information\\".SCC, par. 47 Although the Court stopped short of recognizing an absolute constitutional right to anonymity,SCC, par. 49 it held nonetheless that Spencer had a high degree of informational privacy in his subscriber information. Third, the Court held that Spencer's expectation of privacy in his subscriber information was a reasonable one. The Court dismissed the Crown's argument that the request for subscriber information was authorized by section 7(3)(c.1)(ii) of PIPEDA, which provision requires lawful authority for any disclosure. However, the existence of lawful authority itself depends on the existence of a reasonable expectation of privacy in subscriber information. Thus PIPEDA was not determinative of the issue at hand. The Court held further that the police's search was not authorized by law, interpreting lawful authority as more than a \\"bare request by law enforcement\\".SCC, par. 71 The Court thus found the search unreasonable on the basis of the Collins test. Since the search warrant that led to Spencer's arrest was predicated entirely on the unreasonable search of Spencer's subscriber information, there would not have been grounds to issue the warrant had the police acted lawfully. Thus the search of Spencer's sister's house was unconstitutional, violating section 8 of the Charter. However, the Court held that the evidence obtained during the search of Spencer's sister's house should not be excluded, on the basis of the Grant test. The state's conduct was deemed not to constitute \\"wilful or flagrant disregard of the Charter\\"R v Grant, par. 75 because the Saskatoon Police Service reasonably believed that the subscriber information request to Shaw was authorized by law. The impact of the Charter-infringing conduct on Spencer was serious, unmasking his anonymity and exposing his online choices. However, society's interest in the adjudication of the case, one involving serious offences with mandatory minimum prison sentences, on its merits outweighed any privacy infringement.SCC, par. 76‚Äì81 The Court agreed with the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal that the trial judge had erred by holding that the offence of distribution of child pornography required proof of a positive step.SCC, par. 86  Impact  The Supreme Court's decision was hailed as a landmark victory for privacy and anonymity, sending a \\"strong message on Internet privacy\\" and holding definitively that law enforcement cannot use the section 7(3)(c.1)(ii) PIPEDA disclosure provision or the section 487.014 Criminal Code investigative power alone to compel ISPs to disclose a customer's subscriber information.

After some years of faithful service, in various capacities, Tom becomes a member of the firm. Lillie obtains a position as a stenographer in their office. She and Tom do not recognize each other, until Tom accidentally sees in her hand the little knife he had given her in the long ago. He declares he had loved her through the years, and has been patiently waiting for her, so the romance that began at the circus finds a happy climax at the altar.\\"  Cast  *Frank H. Crane as Tom Gates (adult) / alternatively Tom Wilk in the synopsis *Anna Rosemond as Lillie Lockwood (adult)  Production  The writer of the scenario is unknown, but it may have been Lloyd Lonergan. Lonergan was an experienced newspaperman still employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. He was the most important script writer for Thanhouser, averaging 200 scripts a year from 1910 to 1915. While the director of the film is not known, two Thanhouser directors are possible. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company for a short time, moving to Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. Bowers does not attribute either as the director for this particular production nor does Bowers credit a cameraman. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. The two known credits in the film are for the leading players, Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane. Rosemond was one of two leading ladies for the first year of the company and joined in the autumn of 1909. Crane was involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company from 1909. Crane's was the first leading man of the company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser. The setting of the film included Barnum and Bailey circus that were shot by a special arrangement with Mr. Barnum and Bailey. The date of the filming is unknown, but the 1910 route of Barnum & Bailey's Greatest Show on Earth indicates that it the circus was in New York between March 24 through April 30. The circus was at Madison Square Garden from March 24 through April 22 and it moved to Brooklyn, New York for April 25 through April 30. The circus would go to Philadelphia, Washington D. C., Baltimore, Maryland, and Wilmington, Delaware before moving back up through New Jersey on May 14 through May 18. According to one review in the Santa Cruz Sentinel, the film showed \\"...the Barnum and Bailey circus from the time they arrive at the lot until after the show.\\"  Release and reception  The one reel film was released on Friday May 20, 1910. There are different records for the length of the reel. According to Bowers, the film was 975 feet long, but one trade publication listed it as being 940 feet long. The film was advertised in theaters in Kansas, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Minnesota, Indiana, and California. The film was released one day before the Barnum and Bailey tent caught fire in Schenectady, New York. The May 21 fire did not result in injury or loss of life, but was caused an estimated $10,000 in damages, . The film was met with favorable reviews from critics. The Morning Telegraph offers general praise for the good photography and the well-told story. The Nickelodeon was equally positive and began to reflect the acting, staging and photography was up to the regular standard of the Thanhouser company. The New York Dramatic Mirror offered additional comments on the Thanhouser company's higher standards in their productions, but gave an otherwise positive review that focused on the novelty of the circus scenes.

It is a religion formed from the blending of Fon and Ewe beliefs and Dahomey religion which came to form Haitian Vodou.

Cuban Vod√∫ is noteworthy for its popularity in the Oriente Province of Cuba and a lack of academic study of the religion. Even though much of the practices come from Haitian immigrants bringing Haitian Vodou to Cuba the Cuban practices differ in some ways.

He was one of the most prolific high school distance runners in the late 1970s when he competed with Loara High School from his hometown, Anaheim in California. During this time he joined the rivalry between a notable generation of California high school runners, including the likes of Eric Hulst and Thom Hunt. Serna went on to represent the United States at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships in 1975 and 1976, and also had a collegiate spell with University of California, Irvine. Running career =High school= Serna attended Loara High School of Orange County, California, and competed in cross country and track in a time when California was the national hub of the high school distance running scene. Serna's reputation for leading races and the disproportionate amount of talented distance runners among Californian highschoolers accumulated to storied rivalries between Serna, Eric Hulst, Thom Hunt, and others. In the 1974 National Postal 2-mile cross country race, Serna placed first with a time of 8:56 in a loaded field (the National Postal was the only national-class high school cross country meet at the time), ahead of fellow Californian Eric Hulst. Dyestat Archive: 1974 17th Annual 2-mile National Postal Results At the 1975 CIF California State Meet, Serna ran the fastest non-winning two-mile time in US high school history, in a time 8:45.90 (less than a second slower than winner Eric Hulst).

The encounter was captured on a dash-cam video that was released on January 22, 2015. Details The two-minute fatal encounter started from a routine traffic stop, in which Bridgeton officers Braheme Days and Roger Worley pulled over a vehicle for running through a stop sign. While questioning the two men in the car, Leroy Tutt and Jerame Reid, who was African-American, the video shows Days suddenly shouting to his partner, \\"We've got a gun in his glove compartment!\\" followed by \\"Show me your fucking hands.\\" Days, who appears to recognize Reid, as he is heard calling him by his first name, retrieves a large silver handgun from the glove compartment. Days continues to warn Reid to not move, as Reid continues to move his hands around inside the vehicle. Several times, Days exclaims, \\"He's reaching for something!\\" As the situation intensifies, someone in the vehicle can be heard telling the officers, \\"I'm not reaching for nothing. I ain't got no reason to reach for nothing.\\" Reid then tells Days, \\"I'm getting out and getting on the ground.\\" The officer responds, \\"No you're not, stay right there, don't move.\\" A struggle ensues as Reid tries to push the door open, and the officer attempts to keep the door closed. Days steps back, and Reid pushes the door open, gets up, and exits the car with his hands at chest level. Days backs up and fires as Reid exits the vehicle. Reid reacts to the shots by moving his hands upwards. Worley fires one shot, and Reid is killed. Reid was unarmed at the time. Legal proceedings According to a statement from the Cumberland County Prosecutor's Office, the two officers told investigators that they feared for their lives, believing that Reid was reaching for a weapon. On August 20, 2015, a grand jury voted not to file charges against the two officers involved in the shooting.  Braheme Days  Braheme Days is African American and formerly worked as a personal finance teacher at Woodbury High School in 2009. A 2011 article wrote that Days, aged 31 and a father of two, grew up in Bridgeton. During a meeting of Bridgeton residents, Days suggested violence is a \\"many- headed beast, and we are going to have to attack it from many angles\\". Days is the father of Braheme Days, Jr., a shot putter from Bridgeton High School. Days joined the Bridgeton police force in 2012 after training in the academy for six months. He was praised by Police Chief Mark Ott for winning \\"four out of the five awards given to recruits in his graduating class\\". Cumberland County Prosecutor Jennifer Webb-McRae, who knew Days through another community leadership position he held, praised Days' \\"excellent character\\". In August 2014, Days and Patrolman Edward Connolly were allegedly shot at by Tyshaun S. Milledge while investigating a burglary. Milledge pleaded not guilty to the charge of shooting at the officers. Between 2012 and the Reid shooting, there had been nine municipal court complaints filed alleging that Days had \\"stopped, searched or charged for no reason\\", but these complaints were dismissed with the reason of a lack of probable cause. In October 2014, a video emerged of a Bridgeton police officer spraying a handcuffed suspect with what appears to be pepper spray, with the suspect questioning why the \\"macing\\" was being used against him. People at the scene and within the video identified Days by name as the officer. In February 2015, a lawsuit was filed against Braheme Days by Shakera Brown. Brown claimed that from January to December 2014, Days extorted her for sex in exchange for not sending her to jail.

It was derived from N-acetylserotonin (NAS). Relative to NAS, HIOC possesses greater potency and a longer half-life (~30 min or less for NAS in rats, while HIOC is still detectable up to 24 hours after administration to mice; ~4 hour half-life for HIOC in mouse brain tissues). It is described as producing long-lasting activation of the TrkB receptor and downstream signaling kinases associated with the receptor. HIOC is systemically-active and is able to penetrate the blood-brain-barrier. In animal studies, HIOC was found to robustly protect against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, an action which was TrkB-dependent. A chemical synthesis of HIOC has been published in 2015.

The cornerstone was laid in 1933 on the site of the previous 1868 building which was razed during the construction of the new courthouse (the former clock tower's face and clockworks would be later rebuilt into a new tower as part of the new Sheridan Elementary School in the late 70s). It was completed in 1934 as a Works Progress Administration project, having provided 200 local workers with jobs in the midst of the Great Depression. The building received a four-story rear annex in 1956 and interior renovations in 1968. At that time, the building included county offices, a jail, and several court rooms. The jail (which took up the topmost sixth floor) eventually moved to a new building next door in the early 80s with the Sheboygan County Sheriff's Department, before itself being split in a men's jail on the south side of Sheboygan in the mid 90s, with the women's jail and juvenile hall remaining in the 80s facility. Several county offices moved to a new administration building in the late 90s across the street, northeast of the courthouse. The combined 911 dispatch facility for Sheboygan county and the city of Sheboygan is within the 80s facility. The courthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, in part as a representative of the then modern design of a 20th-century government building, breaking with tradition-laden courthouses of the past. In the summer of 2018, the building received a renovation which reconstructed the front entrance to meet ADA and post-9/11 security guidelines, along with a front drive. The newly-renovated front entrance is secured with metal and x-ray detectors, and now the only public means of entrance into the building.

In Mexico, they live in a broad range of habitats and can be found in desert regions, grasslands and various sorts of woodland.Mackay, W. P. and E. Mackay. 2002. The ants of New Mexico (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Edwin Mellen Press, Lewiston, NY. They also nest under stones, but they usually prefer to nest in soil instead. Fields, meadows and pastures are ideal habitats for the species, and they will colonise woodland areas that are more open spaced. Methyl-n-amyl ketone chemicals are said to be marked on foraging tracks by these ants. These ants thrive in hot weather and dry conditions, and they are mostly active when it is hot, and will not forage during the night possibly because of cooler temperatures. Behaviour Reproductive alates during nuptial flight were recorded from May to August, and colonies of this species are polygyne, which means they have multiple queens, but colonies are usually small to moderately large in size. They forage for insects and tends to Hemiptera; they also feed on flower nectar. In the Gulf Coast, these ants are considered a household pest, where they nest in homes and invade houses.

The substance is a cold low density gas made of molecules each composed of a helium atom and lithium atom bound by van der Waals force. The preparation of LiHe opens up the possibility to prepare other Helium dimers, and beyond that multi-atom clusters that could be used to investigate Efimov states and Casimir retardation effects.  Detection  It was detected in 2013. Previously 7Li4He was predicted to have a binding energy of 0.0039 cm‚àí1 (7.7√ó10‚àí8eV, 1.2√ó10‚àí26J or 6 mK), and a bond length of 28 √Ö. Other van der Waals bound helium molecules were previously known including Ag3He and He2. Detection of LiHe was done via fluorescence. The Lithium atom in the X2Œ£ state was excited to A2Œ†. The spectrum showed a pair of lines, each split into two with the hyperfine structure of 7Li. The lines had wavenumbers of 14902.563, 14902.591, 14902.740 and 14902.768 cm‚àí1. The two pairs are separated by 0.177 cm‚àí1. This is explained by two different vibrational states of the LiHe molecule: 1/2 and 3/2. The bonding between the atoms is so low that it cannot withstand any rotation or greater vibration without breaking apart. The lowest rotation states would have energies of 40 and 80 mK, greater than the binding energy around 6 mK. LiHe was formed by laser ablation of lithium metal into a cryogenic helium buffer gas at a temperature between 1 and 5 K. The proportion of LiHe molecules was proportional to the density of He, and declined as the temperature increased.  Properties  LiHe is polar and paramagnetic. The average separation between the lithium and helium atoms depends on the isotope. For 6LiHe the separation is 48.53 √Ö, but for 7LiHe the distance is much smaller at 28.15 √Ö on average. If the helium atom of LiHe is excited so that the 1s electron is promoted to 2s, it decays by transferring energy to ionise lithium, and the molecule breaks up. This is called interatomic Coulombic decay. The energy of the Li+ and He decay products is distributed in a curve that oscillates up and down about a dozen times.

It was established by N.E.B. Ezra, who served as the paper's Editor-in-Chief for more than 30 years until his death in 1936, as the official newspaper of the Shanghai Zionist Association. It was one of China's oldest and most sophisticated Jewish periodicals, which also influenced the Jewish press in India. History Israel's Messenger was founded in 1904 by the Sephardi Jewish businessman Nissim Elias Benjamin Ezra (1883‚Äì1936) as the official mouthpiece of the Shanghai Zionist Association, which had been established by Ezra the year before. Ezra served as the paper's Editor-in- Chief for more than 30 years until his death in 1936. In addition to promoting Zionism, the paper reported on the activities of the Jewish communities in Shanghai and the rest of China, as well as world events. It was published fortnightly, and later monthly. Israel's Messenger was one of China's oldest and most sophisticated Jewish periodicals. It was also circulated in the United States, where it successfully positioned itself as the most authoritative Jewish voice from East Asia. The chief editor of the newspaper and other Zionist scholars cooperated with Imperial Japan. Japanese military officer Koreshige Inuzuka said he tried to use the Jewish media, including Israel's Messenger, to influence American opinion. Owing to financial difficulties, publication was suspended between February 1910 and September 1918, but the paper survived until its final issue appeared on 17 October 1941. The newspaper influenced the Jewish press in India. The Sargon brothers (Benjamin, Joseph, and David) of Bombay, who were nephews of N.E.B. Ezra, grew up reading Israel's Messenger. Greatly influenced by Ezra's journalistic concepts, the brothers edited the Jewish Advocate (later renamed the Jewish Tribune) in the 1930s, bringing it to a much higher level of professionalism than the older Jewish newspapers of Bombay.

Serbian consulates opened in the seats of the vilayets of Kosovo (Pristina), Manastir (Bitola) and Salonica (Thessaloniki). The Bitola council officially opened on May 9, 1889 with the mission to protect the interests of Serbs in the area, working on opening Serbian schools, etc. Background Mihailo Ristic's Report, Consul in Bitola, to Ljuba Koljevic, Minister of Foreign Affairs, about the events in the vilayet of the day of the uprising. (Bitola, July 29, 1903) Serbian national work in Old Serbia and Macedonia reached better results at the end of the 1860s and beginning of 1870s, increasing after the Great Eastern Crisis with the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and troop deployment in the Sanjak of Novi Pazar. The Society of St. Sava (est. 1886) and an educational department (est. March 1887) would handle the greater part of educational-cultural work, while Stojan Novakoviƒá, the Serbian Minister in Constantinople (1886‚Äì91), led the educational-cultural work, in effect, through the consulates of Skopje (1887), Thessaloniki (1887), Pristina (1889) and Bitola (1889). The main tasks of the consulates were to open schools, establish church-educational municipalities, Serbian bookshops and spreading Serbian literature, and educating Macedonians. Novakoviƒá prepared the opening of schools and church-educational municipalities within the Ecumenical Patriarchate in spring 1887. It was stressed that the Greek metropolitans were to help the Serbian consulates and overall Serbian activity in the Ottoman Empire. The establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate in 1870 had led to a schism in the Patriarchate and a boost to Bulgarian national aspirations in the Balkans. The return of Bulgarian bishops to the eparchies of Skopje, Ohrid and Veles at the end of the 1880s alarmed the Serbian and Greek diplomacy. Bulgarian politicians had a goal of implementing the borders drafted in the Treaty of San Stefano (1878). Novakoviƒá met with Ottoman representatives to whom he opposed placing the Bulgarian bishops, however, two Bulgarian bishops arrived at Ohrid and Skopje in 1890, which nevertheless prompted pursuing Serbian national interests in Macedonia. When asked by an Austro-Hungarian minister on the \\"ethnographic situation\\" he described the Macedonians as a transitional link between Serbs and Bulgarians, similar to Little Russia and Provence. Novakoviƒá started negotiations over the determination of spheres of interest in Macedonia with the arrival of Greek minister Nikolaos Mavrocordatos in Constantinople (1889).

The series is serialized in Mag Garden's Monthly Comic Garden magazine and is licensed in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment. A three-part prequel OVA of the manga was animated by Wit Studio as well as an anime television series adaptation that aired from October 2017 to March 2018. Plot Having been ostracized by both her relatives and partially by society, orphaned high school student Chise Hatori decides to sell herself at an auction in order for somebody else to take her in and have a new place to call home. At the auction in London, she is sold for five million pounds to Elias Ainsworth, a seven- foot-tall humanoid with an animal skull for a head. This magus, who seems closer to a demon than human, either brings her the light she desperately seeks or drowns her in ever deeper shadows in her new country, Britain. The series deals with a romantic slice-of-life storyline in a surreal & supernatural light. Characters ; : :The teenage protagonist and titular character of the story. She is the apprentice and future bride of Elias Ainsworth. Her father and brother abandoned the family when she was young, and her mother committed suicide in front of her causing her to feel unwanted by her relatives. She allows herself to be sold into slavery so someone will take her in. She is sold for 5 million Pounds to Elias. He tells her she is a Sleigh Beggy, a special magus who can draw magic from her surroundings and from within herself. However, this severely strains their bodies, making Sleigh Beggys very weak, and fated to die prematurely. Hence, Elias bought her with hopes of preventing her early death in about three years. Her small and fragile state has led others to give her the nicknames of Robin, and Little Bird Mage. She frequently receives gifts that suppress her magic to maintain her health. After being taken in by Elias she starts practicing magic, and finds she has a talent for sleep magic, but can also perform any type of magic at the cost of tremendous strain on her body. ; : :He is known as \\"Pilum Muralis\\" (lit. \\"Wall Spear\\"), the Child of Thorns, and the Thorn Mage. He is Chise's master and fianc√©, once apprenticed to Master Lindenbaum. A being with both fae and human elements, his origins are a mystery. It is hinted that he was born from the shadows of the forest, but his humanlike traits also imply that he was a mage who dabbled in black magic, consequently losing his humanity and memories. The other faeries see him as an abomination, something he does not mind. Occasionally he uses glamour spells to hide his animalistic appearance taking on a similar look to people he knows or sees. In the series he first resembles Simon, then Chise, and then an unknown woman. He can summon and control thorns, and transform into shadows. When angry enough, he adopts a more monstrous form consisting of various animal parts, such as a fish tail, wings or a snake body. Lindenbaum calls him a child in regards to Elias' limited understanding and sensations of human emotions. To this end, Elias purchases Chise partially because she is a rare Sleigh Beggy, but also with hope she can teach him about human feelings and behavior. He dislikes children because they often see through his shadow magic and fear him. The ones that don't fear him ask a lot of questions about him he can't answer. ; : :He is Chise's familiar, a Church grim who was originally a graveyard guard dog who chased away grave robbers and evil spirits. He was formerly called and used to be owned by Isabel. He initially thinks of himself as a human, keeping a human form until he later recalls his true identity. He shares a mental link with Chise and considers her a sister. Ruth's dog form resembles an Irish Wolfdog, although this form can change much like Elias, and he sometimes travels in Chise's shadow. ; : :She is an old acquaintance of Elias. She is a mage and a technician of the Magus Craft. :Her father was a technician of the Magus Craft. Even though her father was a magician, Angelica, who only had the quality of a sorcerer, could not directly learn the ways of her father. She worked hard to find her own method of performing magic. She later married, and had a daughter named Althea. ; : :She is the fairy landlady of the house where Elias and Chise reside. Originally a banshee, she is now a silent silkie and takes care of the housekeeping duties in the household. While protective of Chise, she strongly dislikes Simon Kalm the village priest, glaring at him when he enters Elias' house and wrapping her arms around Chise to protect her. ; : :Commonly called Lindel, he is Elias's magician master, and he lives in the Land of Dragons. Guarding the last sanctuary of dragons, he is the caretaker of the dragon's nest. His title is Echoes: Song of Flowers, and is many centuries old. ; : :She is a beautiful vampiric faerie who loves men and gives them talent at the cost of dying young. She had strong feelings for an old man named Joel Garland, but denied that they were in love as love would meant his inevitable death. Unfortunately, her presence was already killing him unintentionally at a slow rate. After learning this, Chise created a remedy that allowed them to see each other one last time. After Joel's passing, she tells Chise she will be living in Joel's garden and will not look for more lovers anymore. She later received the name, Redcurrant („É¨„ÉÉ„Éâ„Ç´„É©„É≥„Éà Reddokaranto), as Joel and Chise noted her eyes were the same color as the flower in Joel's Garden. ; : :He is the priest of the local church in the English town occupied by Elias and Chise, and was assigned the task of observing Elias. He has a breathing condition that is treated by Elias's medicine. ; : :He is an alchemist who apparently hates Magi and magicians, but still cares for his apprentice Alice. He was scarred in the face while protecting Alice, and later allowed Cartaphilus to take his left arm as material for an experiment in place of Alice. He later rebels against Cartaphilus, and also becomes interested in finding a way to prevent Chise's premature death. ; : :She is Renfred's highly devoted apprentice. A former street urchin, drug abuser and drug seller, Renfred discovered her innate magic potential, and took her in as an apprentice. Despite a few rough meetings with Chise, because of their similar circumstances and having been saved by her, she ends up befriending Chise. ; : :His true identity is \\"Cartaphilus\\", but prefers the name after the young gravedigger he fused with. He is known also as the Wandering Jew, or the \\"Magician of the Flow\\". He is a mysterious being that looks like a young boy, but has been around longer than even Elias. He is so old that he even refers to Ainsworth as a \\"little boy\\". A long time ago, people said that \\"God's Son\\" cast an immortal curse on him for mocking him during the crucifixion, (much like Gestas); it's said his immortality will last until Judgement Day. Through this curse he is unable to die, yet his body continuously rots causing perpetual pain and suffering. While he appears mostly human, he uses the body parts of other creatures and often collects fresh pieces for his body. He travels around the world performing gruesome experiments on both living and dead creatures as well as both humans and fae in hopes of creating a body that will not decay or will give him the ability to finally die. He has persisted for so long at this that he has forgotten why he does experiments causing him to bring nothing but suffering and carnage. His one true desire is to be forgiven and be able to live a life without suffering. ; :Joseph was a kind young boy who was rumored to be the son of a witch. He is in charge of digging graves for his village. The village rejected and bullied him, calling him strange and creepy because of his ability to see fae and speak with the dead. One day he hears a voice calling for help. He follows the voice and finds Cartaphilus, who looks like a shriveled up corpse. He brings Cartaphilus to his house and attempts to nurse him back to health. Cartaphilus makes Joseph feel needed causing Joseph to grow attached and he asks Cartaphilus to take him away once he is healed. Upon learning that Cartaphilus will never get better in order to take him away to a better place, a strange fusion is made between the two giving Cartaphilus Joseph's body in order to take him away from his misery. After the fusion however, both enter a state of temporary amnesia. This fusion does not stop the curse from slowly consuming both of them, rotting them from the inside out. Joseph then regains some memory after hearing about Cartaphilus' past. He then gets angry for suffering for something he didn't do and Cartaphilus does not even remember doing. ; : :He is the mischievous Faerie King and Titania's husband. He resembles a satyr, with hooves and deer antlers. ; : :She is the Faerie Queen and Oberon's wife. She looks like a beautiful and buxom woman riding a donkey, but can temporarily possess other faeries. She is a proud and very kind motherly figure to Ainsworth and frequently requests he come to live with her in the faerie kingdom. She still considers Ainsworth her child as he is the shadow of nature even though he is mostly a beast. Despite repeated requests from Ainsworth not to, she feels sorry for him and wishes for his happiness because she knows he is not accepted by humans or fae and may very well never find a place in the world. ; : :He is Titania and Oberon's bodyguard, who dislikes Elias. He is the one who gave Silver a new purpose and name (chapter twenty-four). ; : :Introduced by Lindel as his master and teacher. She is older than Lindel and is the person that gave both Lindel and Elias their names. ; : :She is a friend of Chise and the older sister of Ethan. While visiting her grandparents over Christmas she got into an argument with Ethan, in which afterwards, he ran off into the woods. Then Stella frantically went around town looking for him, but she couldn't find him and strangely everybody but her forgot he existed. Then she ran into Chise and Elias, telling them what happened and begging for their help. They agreed to help, then found out that it was Ashen Eye that took Stella's brother. Once they saved Ethan, Stella repays Chise and Elias by baking them lots of sweets when she visits her grandparents once a month. ; : :A librarian who takes care of Chise. He is seen in The Ancient Magus' Bride: Those Awaiting a Star OVA. ; : :He is an ancient fae that gives Chise a magical fox skin that she can use to mutate into a were-animal of her choosing. Ashen Eye is spiteful towards humans to the point he will use them to amuse himself. ; : :At first, Chise is the only one who sees or hears Mariel at Seth's auction house. Mariel later appears before Elias and Chise, revealing she's a witch, and that she may have a solution to Chise's curse. ; : :Chise's father. Back in Japan, he kept their neighbors from spying on them until he and his youngest son Fumiki ran away together, leaving Chise and her mother to fend for themselves. ; : :Chise and Fumiki's late mother. Originally before her death, she was kind, loving and soft-spoken; she tried protecting her daughter from the creatures that were drawn to her--but after a while, she grew to hate her own daughter. The stress of having to care for Chise tore her apart and she decided to end her own life by killing herself in front of Chise. It is implied that in the past, Chise's mother had gone through similar things when she was younger but was able to persevere. The stress of dealing with it again alongside raising Chise was what made her susceptible to her manipulation and near strangulation of her daughter. It is through her that Chise inherited the red hair and green eyes. ; :Chise's younger brother who mysteriously disappeared with his father. Like the rest of his family, he has incredible magical energy that in the same vein as his father created a protective barrier at the family apartment to keep the neighbors away. ; : :A distant relative of Chise through marriage, her husband Shouji forced her to take her in to avoid having a negative reputation and raised her along her two sons. However, Akiko was heavily negligent of Chise and was constantly complaining to her husband due to his business trips, leaving him to not deal with the young mage-to-be.

He also commented that the series' art \\"remains gorgeous and well-suited to the story all throughout this volume ... the backgrounds are lush and faces expressive, and the whole style has an ornate looseness to it that works perfectly for this kind of fantasy storytelling\\". He concluded by saying \\"If you have any appreciation for this style of classic fantasy storytelling, Ancient Magus' Bride is a can't-miss production\\".

Exploring 21st-century gay life, the series focuses on middle-aged Henry Best (Vincent Franklin). Following a disastrous date night with his boyfriend of nine years, Lance Sullivan (Cyril Nri), Henry's old life shatters. He embarks on a new life with unfamiliar rules. In development since 2006, Cucumber was announced along with E4's companion series Banana, and 4oD's web series Tofu in November 2013. The titles of all three shows come from a scientific study into the male erection, which divided the erection into a hardness scale consisting of tofu, peeled banana, banana, and cucumber. Upon reading the study, Davies remarked that \\"right there and then, I knew I had my drama\\". Cucumber ran for one series. Davies confirmed that Cucumber was a one and done story and would not return for a second series. The show was nominated for the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding TV Movie or Limited Series. Development Cucumber was created by Davies during his tenure as showrunner of Doctor Who. Envisioned as a spiritual sequel to the seminal 1999‚Äì2000 Channel 4 series Queer as Folk, More Gay Men, as it was then called, was to focus on middle-aged gay men. It developed from the question, \\"why are so many gay men glad when we split up?\\" that his friend Carl Austin had asked him in 2001. The show was initially due to enter production in 2006, but the success of the revival of Doctor Who indefinitely delayed the series. By March 2007, Davies had fleshed out the initial episode. He explained a pivotal scene in correspondence with journalist Benjamin Cook: By 2008, Davies had moved to Los Angeles, California. More Gay Men was among the list of series that Davies wanted to produce, along with an American adaptation of Bob & Rose. Cucumber had been picked up by the American cable network Showtime and BBC Worldwide and entered into pre-production in July 2011. Pre-production was suspended a month later after Davies's boyfriend Andrew Smith was diagnosed with a brain tumour. The couple returned to Manchester so Smith could undergo chemotherapy nearer to their families. Cucumber was later picked up by Channel 4 to be produced by Davies' former colleague Nicola Shindler and the Red Production Company. The show was Davies' first Channel 4 series in over a decade; Davies had an acrimonious dispute with the channel after a decision to green light production on a Queer as Folk spinoff and The Second Coming was reversed by new executive personnel. Former Doctor Who producer Piers Wenger convinced Davies to return to the channel due to the political nature of the show, which had by then been developed conceptually to include sister shows Banana and Tofu. The three series refer to a urological scale of erection hardness, which consists of tofu, peeled banana, banana, and cucumber, which is alluded to in the show's opening narration. Episodes Reception Writing in The Guardian, Sam Wollaston argued that the debut of the Cucumber/Banana/Tofu trilogy was the \\"television event of the week\\". He said that despite the show being \\"gloriously, triumphantly, explicitly gay\\", he \\"never once felt left out\\" as a heterosexual viewer. Mark Lawson said that the show had a wider theme: \\"the broader genre of respectability meltdown, as Henry is accelerated from smug dullness to scenes featuring police intervention, furious colleagues and social humiliation\\". Both Lawson and Theo Merz (writing in the Daily Telegraph) compare the Cucumber trilogy to Davies' Queer as Folk‚ÄîLawson argues that while Cucumber and Banana are \\"notably sexually graphic\\", the times have changed: \\"Queer as Folk was made at a time when campaigners were fighting to reduce the age of gay sexual consent from 18 to 16, while Davies‚Äô latest shows are screening in an era when men and women can legally marry each other\\", and therefore the depictions of explicit sexual themes are less likely to offend. Merz agrees, stating that Cucumber and Banana \\"feel less dangerous, and so less exciting than the earlier Queer as Folk\\"; Merz also argues that Cucumber has wider latitude to represent more varied gay characters as it is not carrying the burden of being the only show on television representing gay life. Writing in the Telegraph, Gerard O'Donovan argued that the first episode succeeded (\\"In terms of comedy it worked brilliantly, the brio and louche wit of Davies‚Äôs writing bringing a rare energy and grit to the unfolding chaos\\"). But Michael Hogan, also writing in the Telegraph, said that after watching the third episode, he was \\"disappointed\\" and could not find much warmth in the protagonist, Henry. The series was also positively reviewed in The Independent, where Ellen E. Jones stated: \\"In Davies's hands, the tragi-comedy of middle-aged desperation is so sad, but so, very, very funny\\". Jones also argued that the appeal of the show was \\"universal\\" rather than just limited to a gay audience. International broadcasts Both Cucumber and Banana premiered in the United States on Logo on 13 April 2015 and were watched by 55,000 viewers. Both series aired in Australia on SBS Television. In Canada, Cucumber and Banana were broadcast on OutTV in spring 2015. The series aired in Germany as a dubbed version with the first episode on WDR on 30 July 2016, which was watched by 70,000 viewers.

They have multiple graded stakes winners, three Breeders' Cup winners, and the Ramseys themselves have won multiple Eclipse Awards for outstanding owner and breeder. Ken and Sarah own Ramsey Farm, a 1,200 acre horse breeding operation in Nicholasville, Kentucky, and have raced horses at tracks throughout the United States. Many of their race horses have names incorporating the word \\"Kitten\\", Ken's nickname for Sarah Ramsey, used as the inspiration for the name of their leading stallion, Kitten's Joy, a successful racehorse in longer races on turf racetracks. When his style of racing proved unfashionable and outside breeders were reluctant to send mares to him, the Ramseys bought a herd of their own mares to breed and raced the progeny themselves, with considerable success, punctuated by Ken Ramsey personally leading most of his horses into the winner's circle after their races. To further promote the stallion, most of his offspring have \\"Kitten\\" in their names and, in some cases such as Breeders' Cup winners Bobby's Kitten and Stephanie's Kitten, the Ramseys honor friends or family members by incorporating their names as well. Background Both Ramseys are natives of Artemus, Kentucky, near Barbourville. Ken's father was a TVA mechanic. The family lived in a rural area and Ken's childhood home lacked indoor plumbing. Ken graduated from high school in 1952 as the valedictorian and began his college education on scholarship at Union College. He attended Eastern Kentucky University his sophomore year and then enlisted in the United States Navy. He graduated from the University of Kentucky, with help from the GI Bill. He went on to Officer Training School and was a commissioned officer in the Naval Reserve. Sarah was the daughter of a coal miner. She is called by her middle name, Kathern, by friends and family, but is known generally as Sarah. She attended Union College, where she graduated in 1962. Her nickname \\"Kitten\\" was derived from her middle name and given to her by Ken when the couple was dating in 1954. They married in 1958 and have four children. Ken Ramsey began his business career as a truck driver in the northeast before returning to Kentucky and managing a trucking company. He became a realtor in the 1970s and 1980s. Sarah assisted Ken as a secretary and manager of their various enterprises. The Ramseys went on to generate much of their wealth through investment in radio and cellular phone businesses. They owned cellular telephone tower businesses in Georgia, North Carolina, Oregon, California and Kentucky, one of which they sold in 1994 for $39 million and used the proceeds to purchase the former Almahurst Farm in Nicholasville, Kentucky. Their original purchase included 377 acres of the original historic farm, but the seller kept the Almahurst name with him. They named the property Ramsey Farm in 1995, and purchased additional parcels of land over the years, bringing the total acreage to approximately 1,200 acres. Sarah had a severe stroke in 2007, which resulted in her being in a coma for three weeks and developing paralysis on the right side of her body. She now uses a wheelchair and has difficulty speaking; she sometimes communicates via whiteboard. Fellow horse owner Marylou Whitney, who had also suffered a stroke, offered medical advice and emotional support to the Ramseys. To express their gratitude, the Ramseys named one of their fillies Thank You Marylou. Their philanthropic interests include the Kenneth L. and Sarah K. Ramsey Center for Health and Natural Sciences building at Union College. They helped the college obtain the property, which was the former Knox County Hospital, and contributed the funds to help remodel it into a classroom building. Horse breeding and racing Rosie Napravnik on the Ramsey's Dehere On Tour, 2013 Ken's original interest in horse racing began when an aunt took him to Churchill Downs when he was 6 years old. As an adult, he began buying race horses from the claiming race ranks, but his first claimer never raced. As Ramsey explained, \\"The first horse I ever owned was Red Redeemer and it was about 1968 or '69‚ÄîI've been around a long time. I claimed the horse for $1,500 at a now-defunct half-mile bull ring called Miles Park in west Louisville... [the horse] was totally blind in one eye so we ended up claiming a horse that had one eye and no testicles.\\" Ken held a trainer's license for a short period, and the Ramseys bred a few Thoroughbreds in the 1970s and 1980s. They became serious about horse breeding in 1994 when they purchased the former Almahurst Farm, which was the birthplace of 1918 Kentucky Derby winner Exterminator and the Standardbred racehorse Greyhound. They renamed the farm Ramsey Farm and stand the stallions Kitten's Joy, Catienus and Real Solution. The Ramsey Farm focuses on breeding horses to race, not simply to sell or show. They allow their horses to live in a natural environment outside most of the time, which helps the horses be tougher on the track. They stay outside even in cold weather and are allowed to run over rolling, hilly terrain. The Ramsey fields are about 70 acres each and horses are grouped into herds of about 30. Ken Ramsey takes particular pride in the farm's water, which is taken from springs and creeks that are on farm property, and used for both human and horse consumption. However, the horses are also given luxury treatment when needed‚Äîthe farm also has an equine spa that has an underwater treadmill with whirlpool jets. It can be heated, and when horses exit the spa, there is also a vibrating platform beneath heat lamps for further treatment. It was originally built for the care of Kitten's Joy, but is also used by other horses who have a need for its benefits. The Ramseys work with many trainers, matching their horses to trainers that fit a horse's specialty. Kitten's Joy was trained by Dale Romans. Other horses have been trained by D. Wayne Lukas, Bobby Frankel, Chad Brown, and Mike Maker. In 2015, they sent 11 horses to the new training stable of Maker's former assistant, Joe Sharp. By 2017, the Ramseys had 630 horses, with as many as 400 in race training, and produced about 100 foals a year. At the urging of their sons, they began to reduce the number of claiming horses they raced, and downsized their breeding size of their operation to focus their efforts on higher-end races, particularly using daughters of Kitten's Joy to produce horses that can run on dirt tracks and with Derby potential. A grandson said of Ken, \\"he wants it on his tombstone that he won the Kentucky Derby.\\" =Horses= Their best known race horse and premier stallion at their farm is Kitten's Joy, who retired with a 14: 9-4-0 race record and earnings of $2,075,791. He won multiple graded stakes races on turf courses, was second in the 2004 Breeders' Cup Turf, and won the Eclipse Award for American Champion Male Turf Horse. They also had success with the dirt track horse Roses in May, winner of the Dubai World Cup, who they sold to stand at stud in Japan. After retiring Kitten's Joy, they found that the market was poor for offspring of turf horses who did well at distance races; buyers wanted horses that ran on dirt at a young age. So they began to carefully invest in relatively inexpensive mares, some obtained in claiming races, but with suitable pedigrees. They built up a herd of over 100 mares to breed to Kitten's Joy and then they raced the offspring themselves. To help promote the farm's program, Ken Ramsey made a point of leading his horses into the winner's circle after races. Prior to her stroke, Sarah Ramsey also led in winners, but only for the Grade I wins. After their formula proved successful and they had many homebred winners, the stud fee for people to breed outside mares to Kitten's Joy rose, reaching $100,000 for the 2014 breeding season. They also added their Kitten's Joy son Real Solution to their stallion roster in 2015, after that colt won races that included the Premio Botticelli in Italy, the Arlington Million and the Manhattan Stakes in the US, and retired with winnings over $1.3 million. Racing colors of Ramsey Farms The \\"Kitten\\" moniker given to most of the Ramsey's homebred horses originates with Sarah's nickname, \\"Kitten\\". Sarah's first Thoroughbred was named Kitten's First, and that mare produced Kitten's Joy as well as several other winners. Sarah named their stallion \\"Kitten's Joy\\" because \\"she sensed that the horse would bring them great happiness.\\" On the advice of a former partner, Brereton Jones, the Ramseys continue to give \\"Kitten\\" names to the foals sired by Kitten's Joy to recognize the value of the stallion. The Ramseys also name their horses after family members, such as Dean's Kitten, who was named after Kenneth Ramsey's sister-in-law. The filly Stephanie's Kitten, winner of the 2015 Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Turf, was named for the Ramsey's granddaughter. Other people are honored with Ramsey horses being named after them, such as their Breeders' Cup winner Bobby's Kitten, named in honor of race horse trainer Bobby Frankel, and Thank You Marylou, who ran third in the 2014 Kentucky Oaks, named for Marylou Whitney. Other \\"Kittens\\" in the Ramsey stable include Admiral Kitten, Kitten Kaboodle, Fear the Kitten, Big Blue Kitten, and Emotional Kitten. Their naming scheme also brought out humor from other race horse owners; Perry Martin, owner of California Chrome, named a filly Not a Kitten. =Awards and major races= The Ramseys have been North America's leading owners by earnings in 2013 and 2014. They have won four Eclipse Awards for outstanding owners and two for outstanding breeder, and won the 2006 Kentucky Thoroughbred Media award. The Ramseys have won leading owner titles at Saratoga, Gulfstream Park, Ellis Park, and Turfway Park. They hold the record at Churchill Downs for most leading owner titles in the history of the track, with 28 titles, and the record at Keeneland, with 18. The one major race victory to elude them is the Kentucky Derby, which they have yet to win. Their best finish to date in a Triple Crown race was a third-place finish in the 2005 Belmont Stakes with Nolan's Cat. Their Kentucky Derby contenders included Ten Cents A Shine (eighth in 2003), Dean's Kitten (14th in 2010), Derby Kitten (13th in 2011), Charming Kitten (ninth in 2013), We Miss Artie and Vicar's in Trouble (10th and 19th in 2014) and Oscar Nominated (17th in 2016). They were forced to scratch their 2015 contender, Louisiana Derby winner International Star.

Life Rolf Frick was born in Chemnitz in the southern part of what was then central Germany. (Between 1953 and 1990 Chemnitz would be known as \\"Karl-Marx-Stadt\\", which is naturally reflected in contemporary sources.) His father was the director of a publishing house and, a new government regime would later determine, a committed Nazi supporter. By the time he was 9, World War II had ended and Chemnitz found itself in the Soviet occupation zone of what remained of Germany. The leadership pursued a strategy which would lead to the creation, formally in 1949, of a stand-alone Soviet sponsored state, the German Democratic Republic. By 1949 a merger of political parties had already taken place, in April 1946, which formed the basis for a rapid return to centrally directed one-party government. Because of his father's Nazi past, Frick received no direct government authorization for his secondary education. Instead he undertook an apprenticeship as a type-setter while his later school-level education was based on correspondence courses and evening classes. He then moved on to the University of Technology at Karl-Marx-Stadt where he studied Mechanical Engineering, obtaining qualifications in Mechanical engineering and in Polygraphy, following which worked successively as a technical research assistant and in a series of teaching positions, still at Karl-Marx-Stadt. He obtained a doctorate in 1978 with a dissertation entitled \\"Integration of Industrial Design within Product Development\\" (\\"Integration der industriellen Formgestaltung in den Erzeugnis- Entwicklungsprozess\\"). The topic fell within the field of Systematic Heuristics which during the 1950s and 60s took a more prominent place in the university syllabuses in the German Democratic Republic, and in which the Karl-Marx-Stadt University of Technology took a leading role. He moved north in 1979 when he obtained teaching chair as Professor for Design Methodology in Halle at the College of Arts and Design (in the \\"campus\\" then, as now impressively accommodated in Giebichenstein Castle). In 1968, the year of his 32nd birthday, Frick joined the East German Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) which at that time had become one of the \\"bloc\\" parties controlled by the country's ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED) through an administrative structure known as the (East German) National Front. Following reunification in 1989/90 he would become more politically prominent, joining the FDP (Free Democrats) as a result of the east-west merger of German Liberal parties that occurred in 1990. Between 1990 and 1994 he sat for the FDP as member of the Saxony-Anhlalt regional assembly. Between 1990 and 1991 he served as chairman on the assembly's Culture and Media committee. Then, between 4 July 1991 and 21 July 1994 he was the regional Minister for Science and Research, first under Werner M√ºnch and then under Christoph Bergner. The election for the Saxony-Anhalt regional assembly in 1994 saw support for the FDP party collapse from 13.5% in 1990 to 4.2%, which was below the 5% threshold needed to gain any seats, and Rolf Frick accordingly resigned his own seat on 21 July 1994. He now returned to work at The college. Later, in 1997, he became the Managing Director of Sandersleben Maschinen- u. Anlagenbau, a plant and machinery manufacturer located approximately 50 km (30 miles) north-west of Halle.

Life  Mihajloviƒá was born in the village of Tresonƒçe, close to Mavrovo, in 1887. A number of important Macedonians (belonging to the tribe Mijaks) came from this village. His father Mihailo was a builder who spent his life renovating churches in Macedonia and in Kosovo. His mother‚Äôs family came from the neighboring Lazaropole. Mihajloviƒá received his primary and secondary education in Skopje and Thessalonica. He enrolled in the Architectural Department of the Technical Faculty in Belgrade, from where he graduated in 1910 as one of the best students of that generation. Mihajloviƒá proceeded to post-graduate studies in Italy. He returned to Serbia in 1912 to take part in the First Balkans War joining the Chetnik guerrilla unit of vojvoda Doksim and took part in the Kumanovo Battle where he was wounded in the head. In 1914, he was appointed to the Engineering Command of the General staff. He stayed in military service until 1916 and the retreat of the Serbian army to Corfu. He was then sent to the United States to gather financial help and volunteers for the Salonika Front. After the war, he first graduated for a civil servant at the Dubique University, Iowa. He then went to the Sorbonne for specialization and also to London where he studied at the High School for Town Organization. This is where he obtained his PhD in 1920. Back in Belgrade, he was one of the founders of Feniks construction company. As one of the best-educated Serbs from Macedonia, Mihajloviƒá was appointed to be the mayor of Skopje. He performed this function on two occasions: from 1929 to 1936 and from 1939 to his death in 1941. During his two terms he worked hard to transform Skopje into a modern city. Most of the monumental buildings and other much needed infrastructural and educational objects were built on Mihajloviƒá‚Äôs insistence. In his two terms, Skopje was given a detailed urban plan, an extensive water supply system, Matka dam, new railway station, the famous Officers Club on the banks of Vardar, town park, several suburbs based on the principles of ‚Äúgarden cities‚Äù and a zoo.

While it's often considered to be the band's second official studio album, Old Wounds features a compilation of studio recordings, live recordings and composite songs with a mix of studio and live components. The album was released on September 9, 2008 through Temporary Residence Limited ‚Äî the band's first through the label. Old Wounds was produced by Converge guitarist Kurt Ballou and also features guest vocals from Converge bassist Nate Newton.  Reception  Upon release, the album was met with generally positive reviews. Writing for AllMusic, Jim Allen gave the album four-out-of-five stars and said: > Their second album, Old Wounds, explodes with overloaded basslines, > assaultive vocals, and beyond-distorted guitars, but there's an underlying > sense of control here (more obvious on some tracks than on others) that > makes the crucial difference between static and statement. Writing for Seattle newspaper The Stranger, Brian Cook also gave the album four-out-of-five stars and said: > Their second full-length, Old Wounds, is full of the same grit that marks > the finest punk records but succeeds on a grander scale thanks to its > remarkable restraint. The band do achieve some spectacular unglued moments, > but the album really shines when they rein in the assault. Jason Crock of Pitchfork score the album slightly lower with a rating of 6.6/10.0 and said: > Though it's been two years since Settle Down City, the methods on Old Wounds > are commendable even if the results are mixed; more artists would do well to > work fast and in front of crowd as often as possible. Better to lighten the > weight of expectation than take so much time crafting \\"statements\\" and lose > sight of what compels you as a band.

It is found in the south-eastern Alps, ranging from the Dolomites (Italy) in the west to the Julian Alps (Slovenia) in the east and the Carnic Alps and Lienzer Dolomiten (Austria) in the north. The habitats are related to the dwarf-shrub zone and include subalpine meadows, rock formations and scree with Salix-bushes and shrubs. The species is restricted to limestone with an altitudinal range from about 1,200 to 2,300 meters. The wingspan is 10.5‚Äì13 mm. In external appearance adults are distinguishable from Callisto coffeella by the forewing pattern. In basistrigella, the sub-basal whitish silvery line of the forewing is almost parallel and lies in the fold, whereas in coffeella this line is transverse to the wing axis or reduced to a spot. On average, the forewings are slightly narrower than in coffeella. Sexual dimorphism, as observed in coffeella, is absent in basistrigella. Genitalia do not provide obvious diagnostic differences but the length of the phallus is significantly longer in basistrigella than in coffeella. Adults have been collected during the day, flying around low bushes of alpine Salix glabra and Salix waldsteiniana. The flight period is largely dependent on exposure and snow coverage and usually extends between early June and late July. Etymology The species name refers to the characteristic wing markings.Integrative taxonomy reveals a new species of Callisto (Lepidoptera, Gracillariidae) in the Alps References Category:Gracillariinae Category:Moths of Europe Category:Moths described in 2015 ","title":"Callisto basistrigella"},{"id":"45182733","text":"Leptomyrmex erythrocephalus is a species of ant in the genus Leptomyrmex.

It is used as a method to exercise horses too young to be ridden, a way to provide light work to injured horses or those recovering from illness or surgery. It also is a useful method by which a single individual can condition more than one horse at a time. Horses can also be ponied with riders on both horses, a practice commonly seen at racetracks, where the pony rider assists in controlling the other, usually younger and more fractious horse. At a race track, ponying is done to bring race horses to the track, to accompany them as they warm up for exercise, and then pick them back up after they run. Pony riders are required to wear helmets and safety vests when on the track with their charges. Most ponying is done from a western saddle to give the pony rider more security and to allow the rider to \\"dally\\" or wrap the lead rope around the saddle horn if needed to maintain control of the ponied horse. The pony horse must have a calm and steady disposition. Geldings are often preferred mounts due to their more reliable disposition, particularly for ponying stallions. Although the word \\"pony\\" is used, horses used for ponying are generally full-sized.

In 1990, she completed her first lyrical collection, Byggnad √•t mig (A Building for Me). Her dramatic expressionist poems, written in prose, evoke animal and human worlds which are also depicted in later works. Spott ur en √§nglamun (Spitting Out of an Angel's Mouth, 1993) depicts a strange fairytale world seen through the eyes of little girls in red dresses who meet Bambi and Fox. She frequently introduces allusions to violence, desire and rupture, sometimes emphasized by the sensuous tactile effects of necklaces and clothing, as in Strata. As a literary translator, she has rendered into Swedish classic texts by women writers, including Ana√Øs Nin‚Äôs House of Incest, Giannina Braschi‚Äôs Empire of Dreams (poetry collection), Eileen Myles‚Äô Chelsea Girls, and United State of Banana, and Marguerite Duras' Le Navire Night.

The film was released via video on demand on January 23, 2015. Plot Based on a true story, three US Navy airmen are forced to ditch their torpedo bomber in the South Pacific during World War II. They then find themselves on a tiny life raft, surrounded by open ocean. With no food, water and little hope of rescue they drift across the ocean. Against incredible odds, these three virtual strangers survive dehydration, starvation, sharks, storms, the possibility of being apprehended by the Japanese, the madness of isolation, hopelessness and each other as they try to sail more than a thousand miles to safety. Cast * Garret Dillahunt as pilot Harold Dixon * Tom Felton as bombardier Tony Pastula * Jake Abel as radioman Gene Aldrich * Nadia Parra as Frances (Tony's sister) * Quinton Flynn as Newsreel narrator Background Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bomber from VT-6 before the Second World War, similar to the aircraft Dixon flew On January 16, 1942, Chief Aviation Machinist's Mate and enlisted Naval Aviation Pilot Harold Dixon (aged 41, from La Mesa, California), radioman Gene Aldrich (aged 22 from Sikeston, Missouri) and bombardier Anthony Pastula (aged 24 of Youngstown, Ohio) took off from the aircraft carrier USS Enterprise in a Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bomber Bureau Number 0335. As part of Torpedo Squadron SIX (VT-6), they were to undertake an anti-submarine sweep over the Pacific Ocean. Once airborne they were to maintain radio silence to safeguard the carrier being detected by the Japanese. Their aircraft lost position and was unable to return to the carrier. Running low on fuel, Dixon ditched the aircraft in the sea. The aircraft sank quickly taking most of the crew's survival equipment with it. The men inflated the small rubber life raft and climbed inside. Surviving on rainwater and meager rations the men drifted for 34 days and travelled over 1,000 miles, before landing on the Pukapuka atoll, a friendly island. The crew was picked up a week later by a seaplane from the USS Swan. =Medals= For his endeavors to keep his crew alive Dixon was awarded the Navy Cross. The citation read \\"...for extreme heroism, exceptional determination, resourcefulness, skilled seamanship, excellent judgment and highest quality of leadership\\". Pastula and Aldrich both received presidential commendations for their \\"extraordinary courage, fortitude, strength of character and exceptional endurance\\". The life raft the men used is on display at the National Naval Aviation Museum. =Memorials= Dixon died on June 26, 1987 and is buried at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery. Pastula died on October 19, 1982 and is buried in Ohio. Aldrich died of cancer on March 27, 1973 in San Diego.

It is based on Sayed Kashua's book Dancing Arabs (2002). In Canada the film was released under the title Dancing Arabs, which was the film's English- language title at its world premiere (one reviewer noted that the title \\"will prove tricky in marketing campaigns\\"). The film was considered a flop in Israel, with only 48,000 views, despite an $11 million budget. It tells the story of Eyad, an Israeli-Palestinian teenager from Tira who moves to Jerusalem to attend an elite Jewish high school, where he meets Naomi, a Jewish student, and falls in love with her. As part of his school-mandated community service, he meets Yonatan, who suffers from muscular dystrophy, and his mother Edna. Cast * Tawfeek Barhom as Eyad * Michael Moshonov as Yonatan * Yael Abecassis as Edna, Yonatan's mother * Danielle Kitsis as Naomi * Ali Suliman as Salah, Eyad's father * Marlene Bajali as Aisha, Eyad's grandmother * La√´titia E√Ødo as Fahima, Eyad's mother Plot Eyad (Tawfeek Barhom) is a gifted Palestinian teenager who is accepted to an elite Israeli school. His father (Ali Suliman) drives him to Jerusalem and drops Eyad off at the new school. Before entering the school, Eyad's Father tells him that the Palestinian people once longed to defeat their Jewish enemies, but will now settle for being able to live side by side with dignity. In school, he struggles to adapt. His Israeli peers refer to him as \\"Ayid\\" and he is looked down upon by the others. Things change once he meets Naomi (Danielle Kitsis); he helps her with her chemistry schoolwork and the two start to meet at a cafe. Yonatan (Michael Moshonov) is a disabled Israeli teen whom Eyad is assigned by the school to visit. Eyad and Yonatan develop a strong bond, as they are both considered outsiders. Back in school, Eyad and Naomi fall in love and meet up constantly, however, things begin to get complicated. Eyad excels in the classroom and begins to earn the trust and respect of his Jewish peers. He begins to sell falafel and bagels and starts to finally feel comfortable at the school. One day, as Eyad and Naomi are walking in the streets, Naomi asks Eyad to tell her he loves her in Arabic, whereupon an Israeli soldier overhears Eyad, asks to see his ID card, and aggressively questions him. In English class, Eyad and Naomi declare their love to the others and want to tell the world about their relationship. Once Naomi tells her parents about her Palestinian boyfriend, she is no longer allowed to go back to school. Eyad also drops out of school and asks the principal to inform Naomi's parents that she can now go back to school as he is no longer there. The decision angers Eyad's father and he is no longer welcome at home, so he moves to a flat in East Jerusalem and begins to seek work as a waiter. After many unsuccessful attempts, he lands a job as a dishwasher. By this point, Yonatan's health has deteriorated significantly and he is no longer able to move. Yonatan's mother asks Eyad to move in with them, as she trusts him and cannot take care of Yonatan by herself. Eyad realizes that he and Yonatan resemble each other, takes Yonatan's Israeli ID, and becomes a waiter. Yonatan's mother (Yael Abecassis) finds out, but allows Eyad to continue as long as no one ever finds out. Using Yonatan's ID, Eyad takes Yonatan's final exams and scores highly for both of them. Naomi serves in the IDF and tells Eyad that she is sick of lying and chooses to break things off. A while later, Yonatan dies, while Eyad (posing as Yonatan) informs the Muslim authorities that the Muslim Eyad has died. Eyad and Yonatan's mother attend the funeral and the screen goes white.

It is included in the \\"most standard and almost universal\\" arati songs sung at the end of Puja (worship rituals) of Ganesha in Maharashtra, especially in his festival Ganesh Chaturthi as well as in Ganesha temples in the region. Background Samarth Ramdas, the poet. Ganesha is the Hindu god of wisdom, knowledge and new beginnings. He is depicted with an elephant head. Samarth Ramadas was inspired to compose the arati by seeing the icon of Mayureshwara (a form of Ganesha) at Morgaon Ganesha Temple, the chief shrine in the Ashtavinayaka pilgrimage circuit, consisting of eight Ganesha temples around Pune. The arati is composed in the raga (musical mode) Jogiya (Jogia). Pratapaditya Pal describes the \\"addresses and references\\" to Ganesha in the song as \\"remarkable\\", considering Samarth Ramdas's patron deity was Rama, not Ganesha. The genre of arati songs is written in vernacular languages, as opposed the hymns of Hindu religious rituals and mantras, which are in Sanskrit. These songs are sung at the finale of the Puja (worship rituals), while a worshipper offers light to the god. This is done by waving a plate with oil- or ghee-soaked lit wicks in front of the icon.

His pot belly is interpreted to have grown his favourite sweet modaks as well as the sins of his devotees, thus absolving them. A serpent is around his waist. He has three eyes and a soft trunk. His third eye is interpreted to the source of knowledge. Lokprabha notes that the third eye, usually not depicted in Ganesha's iconography, is seen in the Ganesha of Morgaon. He is called Vakratunda, \\"One with a curved trunk\\". Another translation of the word means one who destroys the crooked. In the second last line, the poet's name is given: \\"Your humble servant Ramadas waits for you to come\\". Further, the song requests Ganesha, the Lord who worshipped by all, to be pleased with the devotee in trouble and protect him in distress. The chorus is repeated. Contemporary versions The collection of Ganesha aratis, including the \\"timeless\\" Sukhakarta Dukhakarta by singer-sister Lata Mangeshkar and Usha Mangeshkar, became popular on release in the 1970s. Anuradha Paudwal has the song in her music album Ganesh mantra. The song was used as the theme song for a Rock music concert by musicians Vishal Rane and Sameer Bangare. The song was adapted for the movie Bajirao Mastani and helped set the world record for the largest formation of human mosaic of the form of the God.

Background The Waitakere City Council sought to appoint a business development officer for the city. After interviewing numerous applicants for the position, the council decided to hire Ms Howe, and offered her a starting annual salary of $80,000. In reply to this offer, Howe said that as she had been earning $120,000 a year self-employed for the past 2 years. WDC then increased the starting salary to $100,000, which Howe accepted. However, thinking of the advantages (and not the disadvantages) of being a self-employed contractor, she asked the council if they would consider hiring her as a contractor for $120,000, which the council accepted, and Howe started work whilst the written contract was being drafted. Several months into the contract, due to an unworkable relationship with the WDC management, they notified Howe that they were canceling her contract, giving 1 months notice. The council claimed that such a contract had to be in writing, and as the contract had not been done, they claimed it was legally unenforceable. Howe initially made a claim for wrongful dismissal with the Employment Court, but withdrew this when she realized she was not an employee, but a contractor, and proceeded to file a claim for breach of contract instead. During the discovery proceedings, the WDC discovered that her previous 2 years earnings were overstated, and they amended their defence to include misrepresentation. Decision The court validated the contract and awarded her damages of 1 month, $12,000.

He is the namesake of the ACLU E.B. MacNaughton Civil Liberties Award. Early life and education MacNaughton was born in 1880 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to parents Daniel MacNaughton and Lillias Boyd. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1902. His first job after graduation was as a building contractor working for F.B. Gilbreth in Boston. After moving to Portland in 1903, MacNaughton began working in the office of architect Edgar M. Lazarus. Career The 1984 Portland Historic Resources Inventory identified 37 buildings associated with E.B. MacNaughton. =MacNaughton and Raymond= In 1906 MacNaughton formed an architectural and engineering partnership with Herbert E. Raymond, MacNaughton and Raymond. Raymond may also have trained as an engineer. The partnership existed until 1907 when Ellis F. Lawrence joined the firm. After the departure of Lawrence in 1910, MacNaughton and Raymond briefly resumed their partnership. MacNaughton's designs at this time include the Sellwood Branch YMCA and the Blake McFall Company Building. He is credited with designing the 1906 Alexandra Apartment/Hotel building on NW 21st Place in Portland, although a set of architectural drawings for the building was found among the Lawrence papers, leading researchers to conclude that the design credit should go to Lawrence. MacNaughton and Raymond also designed the 1912 Clyde Hotel. Relying on his skills as a building contractor, MacNaughton accepted the job of renovating the Marquam Building in 1912. Part of the building collapsed during the renovation, and MacNaughton was fired by owner Henry Pittock. An investigation concluded that weak bricks had been used in the original construction. =MacNaughton, Raymond, and Lawrence= The addition of Ellis F. Lawrence greatly increased the architectural skills at the firm. Among the surviving designs of MacNaughton, Raymond, and Lawrence are the Samuel G. Reed House and the Cumberland Apartments. Lawrence left the firm in 1910 to start his own company, and the two remaining partners continued as MacNaughton and Raymond. =Strong and MacNaughton= MacNaughton gradually became more interested in resource planning and asset management, and he formed a partnership with Robert H. Strong sometime after 1911, the Strong and MacNaughton Trust Company.MacNaughton's obituary in The Oregonian cited the year 1911 for the partnership, The Daily Astorian cited 1916, and the NRHP Continuation Sheet for Portland's Chinatown Historic District cited 1918. Strong was an asset manager whose inventory included management of the estate of Henry W. Corbett, and his brother was managing director of the Ladd estate.MacColl p. 238 Strong would soon become a commissioner at the Port of Portland. In 1919 Portland mayor George Luis Baker appointed MacNaughton to the newly created planning commission. Other planners included architects A. E. Doyle and Ellis F. Lawrence. The firm authored a series of newsletters in the 1920s that provided analysis and opinions about capital, real estate, taxes, merchandising, city infrastructure, and city planning. The firm also handled stock investments, and when the Portland Public Market was approved in the 1920s, Strong and MacNaughton was the transfer agent. =First National Bank of Portland= MacNaughton entered the banking industry in the mid-1920s when Frederic B. Pratt, owner of Portland's Ladd and Tilton Bank,Pratt had married Ladd's daughter, Caroline Ames Ladd. suspected that he had been cheated by the previous owners. Pratt hired MacNaughton to analyze the bank's records and discover what had happened. MacNaughton became a vice president at the bank, and when the bank was acquired by the U.S. National Bank of Portland, Strong and MacNaughton were tasked with liquidating the assets.MacColl p. 207-211 In 1928 MacNaughton became a vice president at the First National Bank of Portland, and Strong and MacNaughton was disbanded.MacColl p. 390 In 1932 during the Great Depression, he became president of the bank. He became chairman in 1947 and was scheduled to become honorary chairman in 1960. MacNaughton served for a time as an associate professor of banking at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. =The Oregonian= MacNaughton became a director of The Oregonian publishing company in 1939, a position he would hold for 11 years. During his time on the board, the newspaper undertook a costly relocation and expansion. MacNaughton became president of the company in 1947 and soon began to look for a buyer. The company was purchased for $5.6 million by Samuel Irving Newhouse, Sr. in 1950, and MacNaughton's tenure ended. =Reed College= In 1908 the will of Amanda Reed, widow of Simeon Gannett Reed, established a board of five trustees to oversee Reed College. In 1919 the trustees voted to create a Board of Regents that would absorb the original five trustees and include six newly elected officers. MacNaughton was among the new regents, as was Reed architect A. E. Doyle. MacNaughton served in various capacities at Reed for 24 years. He became president of the college in 1948 during a time of financial crisis. He raised faculty salaries, created a scholarship fund for students, and increased the size of Reed's endowment through donations. In 1952 when Reed was financially solvent, MacNaughton left his job as president. Partial list of honorariums and awards The University of Oregon awarded MacNaughton an honorary doctorate in 1944 in recognition of his many years of service to the Oregon business community. He received the William Freeman Snow Medal for distinguished service to humanity in 1952. MacNaughton served as chairman of the ACLU Advisory Council from 1955 until 1960, and the E.B. MacNaughton Civil Liberties Award was created in 1962 in his honor. Death MacNaughton died of cancer on August 24, 1960. He is buried at River View Cemetery.

Brawl in the Family expanded upon existing Nintendo characters by creating romances between Kirby and Jigglypuff, as well as Samus Aran and Captain Falcon, and by turning originally minor characters into recurring characters, such as Waluigi and a Bug Catcher from the Pok√©mon series. Gaming website Retro described Brawl in the Family as \\"almost aggressively lighthearted,\\" because where \\"a lot of comedic webcomics tend to veer into cynical territory,\\" Retro described Brawl in the Family as having a \\"warm, family friendly tone.\\" Notable comics A small portion of one of the \\"Kirby eats something\\" strips Brawl in the Family started under the title of Kirby Comics and was only uploaded on websites such as GameFAQs and IGN forums, until Taranto decided to expand the comic's cast and publish it on his own website, which was designed by Chris Seward. The first strip on the website is \\"The Showdown\\", published on June 13, 2008, showing a visual gag of Kirby transforming into his nemesis/best friend King Dedede. The character Waluigi was introduced in the April Fool's Day 2009 strip, becoming a recurring and popular character with readers.https://www.dailydot.com/unclick/waluigi- memes/https://venturebeat.com/2018/06/29/listen-to-waluigis-super-smash-bros- ultimate-lament-and-bring-a-tissue/ Musical comics were introduced with the 115th comic, How the King Stole Christmas Part 2, featuring the song \\"You're a Mean King\\", which parodied \\"You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch\\". The 400th Brawl in the Family strip is a music video titled \\"The History of Nintendo\\", which covers the US releases of many Nintendo games throughout the company's history. Nintendo Life stated that the video \\"crams some good detail into its 3:42 running time\\" and described it as \\"catchy.\\" Taranto himself called it his personal favorite Brawl in the Family video. \\"The History of Nintendo\\" was released shortly after Taranto underwent major surgery and was temporarily unable to work on more strips. In response to Mega Man being revealed as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and as the comic's 500th strip, Taranto uploaded a short video titled \\"Prodigal Robot\\" as a tribute to the iconic game character, while poking fun at the \\"popularity curve\\" of the Mega Man franchise. =Nintendo Force= Taranto was contacted by Lucas Thomas of IGN to be one of the comic artists of Nintendo Force Magazine. After stopping with Brawl in the Family, Taranto continued working on Nintendo-themed comics for the magazine. =Ending= Taranto announced his comic's end on July 25, 2014, in his 580th strip titled \\"World Eight-Four\\". Taranto later confirmed his final strip to be released on 3 October, precisely on the date Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS was going to be released. Though this was purely coincidental, Taranto described it as \\"very fitting\\", as the comic started around the time Super Smash Bros. Brawl was released. In an interview with WiiU Daily, Taranto detailed his reasons to stop with his comic: \\"[I] feel like I‚Äôve pushed it about as far as it can go by this point. It‚Äôs gotten more difficult to come up with unique concepts for strips that I haven‚Äôt already covered at some point, and I‚Äôm ready to dive into projects that involve non-existing IPs.\\" The final comic, \\"One Final Song\\", was described as \\"a very nostalgic musical number, drawing together tracks from [the comic's] long and musical history\\" and was dedicated to \\"all of the individuals that have enjoyed his work over the years.\\" Armed Gamer stated that the song \\"really hits in the feels\\" and praised the five \\"Meet Me at Final Destination\\" comics that led up to it. Kickstarter campaigns Taranto's first Kickstarter campaign was to fund Brawl in the Family: Volume 1, a comic book treasury containing the webcomic's first 200 strips, as well as bonus content. The campaign reached its initial goal of $10,000 within the first 24 hours and raised more than $56,000 in total. Around the time of the comic's end, Taranto started a Kickstarter campaign to fund the release of two more hardcover and paperback comic book treasuries containing the remaining 400 comics, as well as a large amount of bonuses. Each book contains a total of 200 strips, covering 244 pages. Available Kickstarter rewards included, but were not limited to, paperback and hardcover versions of all 3 books, a slipcase and signatures. Though the campaign hit its goal, the two new books were almost exclusively given to Kickstarter backers. On March 31, 2018, Taranto launched a Kickstarter for Too Bad. Waluigi Time, a comic book treasury featuring all of Waluigi's previous appearances in the comic, along with 200 new strips focusing on the character and 30 additional Brawl in the Family comics.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/437762268/too-bad-waluigi- time/ The book reached its $25,000 goal in three days, ultimately raising over $90,000 by the time of the campaign's conclusion.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/437762268/too-bad-waluigi- time/posts/2152258https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/437762268/too-bad- waluigi-time/posts/2178835 =Tadpole Treble= In November 2013, together with his brother Michael, Matthew Taranto started a Kickstarter campaign for Tadpole Treble, a music video game featuring a tadpole named Baton. In this game, the music determines the layout of the level. There was a demo of Tadpole Treble available during the Kickstarter campaign. The game was successfully funded on December 7, 2013, and was released on Steam on May 6, 2016 and on Wii U on August 11 of the same year. Podcast Taranto and website designer Chris Seward launched the Brawl in the Family Podcast in February 2013. The podcast is mainly based around the discussion of video games, and has continued even following the end of the comic.

Publication date: 1905. Date revised: 1902. was a station which served the hamlet of that name, about a mile away in the parish of Rathven, Scottish county of Moray. It was served by trains on the Buckie and Portessie Branch north of Keith. History The station was opened by the Highland Railway in 1884 to serve the small village and rural area of Rathven but had a short life with services being suspended during World War I on 9 August 1915 and the rails south of Buckie removed, although it was hoped to restart services. The line remained closed in 1923, when the Highland Railway was absorbed by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS). After this the track was relaid, but services were not restarted and the track removed again in 1937.Geograph The line to Aultmore became the terminus of a goods spur from Keith and continued in use until 1966. The station was located next to the turnpike road and in 1915 it was reported that it had handled 3000 tons of goods traffic, mainly grain, meal, coal, potatoes and livestock. It is said that the station had been built at the behest of the Countess of Seafield who used the station to travel to Castle Grant from her home at Cullen House. Work had begun on the Keith to Portessie line of the Highland Railway on 7 November 1882. Wartime economies led to closure of the line on 9 August 1915 and in 1917 the track between Aultmore (towards Keith) and Portessie was requisitioned by the Admiralty. The Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) re-opened the north and south sections of line by 1919, but the Aultmore to Portessie section (passing through Drybridge) was never re-opened and the track was again removed in 1937. The construction of the GNoSR Moray coast route \\"effectively doomed the Highland route. Westbound journeys were shorter via the GNSR, and although the route to Aberdeen was longer, the Moray Coast Railway had services that were faster, more frequent and more convenient, with through trains running from Elgin, along the coast and to Aberdeen. As a rather straggly branch line, the Highland route struggled to compete, and the population between Buckie and Keith was too sparse to provide much additional traffic.\\"Long Lost Railways Accessed : 2015-01-23 The fair ground for the 'Peter Fair' and extra trains were run on these days. Since 1871 Inchgower Distillery had been established nearby and Rathven handled all its traffic, together with agricultural produce and livestock. =Infrastructure= The station had a single stone built platform on the \\"up\\" side to the east, a signal box on the platform at the Buckie end and had sizeable and neat wooden station building, which, unlike many of the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNoSR) stations on the nearby Moray Coast line, had a canopyFlikr for passenger comfort whilst awaiting trains. A few \\\\additional sidings were present to allow shunting to take place away from the main line, two loading banks and some railway cottages were present at the site, including two porter's cottagesBanffshire Sheet II.SW Probable Publication date: ca. 1949.
