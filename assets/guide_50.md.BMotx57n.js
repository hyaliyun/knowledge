She was also referred to as Saint Agnes Blannbekin or the Venerable Agnes Blannbekin, though never beatified or canonized by the Roman Catholic Church. Her revelations were compiled by an anonymous confessor before being transcribed by the monk Ermenrich and later published in 1731 as Venerabilis Agnetis Blannbekin. The copies were confiscated by the Society of Jesus, and only two manuscripts survived. One was destroyed in a fire at the Strasbourg library in 1870. The surviving manuscript, currently owned by a Cistercian convent in Zwettl, Austria, was not released until the 20th century. Although Blannbekin is best remembered today for her visions, during her life she was known for her ministry to the urban population and her strange and provocative expressions of faith.  Life  Blannbekin was likely born in Plambach, Austria to a peasant family; due to her Life and Revelations being the only source of information from her directly, little is known with certainty. Her surname, which is also sometimes spelled Blanbakin, is a derivation of the name of this village (i.e., Plambachen). At the age of seven or eight, Blannbekin began secretly giving her meals to the poor. By the age of ten or eleven, she began craving the sacramental bread. In around 1260, she joined the Third Order of Saint Francis in Vienna; for the rest of her life she refused to eat meat, claiming the body of Christ was enough meat for her. During services and prayers in her early teenage years, Blannbekin began to hear voices which explained spiritual mysteries. Like her more famous contemporary, Angela of Foligno, Blannbekin‚Äôs revelations were dictated to an anonymous Franciscan confessor, and were transcribed by the Franciscan friar Ermenrich possibly as early as 1318; like many women mystics during this time, Blannbekin herself was illiterate. Devotional texts by women mystics that are ‚Äúco-authored‚Äù in this way are thought to suffer from interference from the filtering and dilution of their male scribes. Understandings of the ‚Äúconstruction of authorial personae‚Äù necessitate doubts of the validity of the transcriptions. Her visions are typified as distinctive to high medieval devotionalism and used ‚Äúfamiliar teaching techniques such as enumerating twelve glories of the Virgin, five types of confessors, and four ways of receiving the eucharist, made memorable through vivid color symbolism and animal imagery,\\" though marked by the eroticism ingrained in them. Blannbekin‚Äôs contemporaries were quick to show contempt for her, and she carried the reputation of being ‚Äúodd‚Äù even when she held respect. In one story, she was derided for compulsively bowing toward a basement window as she walked through town, but regained respectability after a stolen Eucharist was discovered in that said basement; however, occasions like these led to her feeling ‚Äúwrongly accused and defamed.\\"  Association with Extremist Religious Consumption  At the age of seven or eight, Blannbekin began secretly giving her meals to the poor; she would continue performing acts of both charity and self-starvation throughout her life. By the age of ten or eleven, she began craving the sacramental bread. In around 1260, she joined the Third Order of Saint Francis in Vienna, and for the rest of her life she refused to eat meat, claiming the body of Christ was enough meat for her; this led to her joining the legacy of mystics who used food and consumption (or lack thereof) as a vehicle for the soul to express its desire for God, because food was ‚Äúa central metaphor [and] the most direct way of encountering God.‚Äù Caroline Bynum writes: > ‚Ä¶to eat Christ is to become Christ. The Christ one becomes, in the reception > of communion and in the imitation of asceticism, is the bleeding and > suffering Christ of the cross. The flesh of Jesus‚Äîboth flesh as body and > flesh as food‚Äîis at the very center of female piety. And this flesh is > simultaneously pleasure and pain. Blannbekin also joined the ranks of spiritual women who often fasted for long periods to induce a ‚Äúsuffering‚Äù as an offering to Christ. Gluttony (‚Äúthe major form of lust‚Äù) is sinful in the Christian faith, and as it is the binary opposite of fasting (‚Äúthe most painful renunciation‚Äù), the church is predisposed to indulge fasting as a saintly act‚Äîhowever, this opens a channel for extremism that has been renounced in recent decades. Like saints receiving stigmata, spiritual women who practiced extreme fasting ‚Äúfelt that [their] suffering was service‚Äîthat it was one with Christ‚Äôs suffering and that it therefore substituted for the suffering of others, both their bodily ills and their time in purgatory,‚Äù and viewed the physicality of their starvation as their bodies ‚Äúquite literally [becoming] Christ‚Äôs macerated and saving flesh.‚Äù Through this physical performance of religiosity, pious revelations had a literality that enhanced the fulfillment of worship for medieval Christians.  Association with Mystic Eroticism  Although not all of her revelations were considered obscene, they included visions of monks, women, and Jesus naked, and described pseudo-sexual ecstasy at receiving them. In one vision, she claimed to have felt the foreskin of Jesus in her mouth: > Crying and with compassion, she began to think about the foreskin of Christ, > where it may be located [after the Resurrection]. And behold, soon she felt > with the greatest sweetness on her tongue a little piece of skin alike the > skin in an egg, which she swallowed. After she had swallowed it, she again > felt the little skin on her tongue with sweetness as before, and again she > swallowed it. And this happened to her about a hundred times. And when she > felt it so frequently, she was tempted to touch it with her finger. And when > she wanted to do so, that little skin went down her throat on its own. And > it was told to her that the foreskin was resurrected with the Lord on the > day of resurrection. And so great was the sweetness of tasting that little > skin that she felt in all [her] limbs and parts of the limbs a sweet > transformation. Blannbekin described herself as continually beset with visions throughout the day, which she described as imber lacrimarum, or a \\"rain of tears\\" from God. Many of these visions involved bright lights, and in one she described being \\"so filled with light within that she could gaze at herself.\\" As with the foreskin occasion, many of her visions involved touch, such as being kissed on the cheeks by the Lamb of God. While eating the Eucharist, Blannbekin claimed to taste Christ; on one occasion, a sexually immoral priest could not find his Eucharist, which Blannbekin claimed to have felt in her own mouth. Similarly, she described drinking a \\"refreshing spiritual drink\\" from the spear wound of Jesus. Supposed visitations from Jesus himself caused an orgastic reaction: \\"Agnes herself was filled with an excitement in her chest every time that God visited her that was so intense that it went through her body and that it burned as a result, not in a painful but in a most pleasurable manner.\\" The eroticism of Blannbekin‚Äôs visions are not without precedent; other mystics also presented Christ images with sexual effects or connotations. The reputation she earned during her lifetime is thought to be more related to her behavior than the erotic content of her visions, and sexual contextualization of religious revelations for women was common.  Criticism and Support  Modern scholars are splintered over the themes and messages of Blannbekin. Most accounts take a gynocentric viewpoint, e.g. analyzing the erotic images of Christ in terms of feminist criticism; this presents a patterned shift in her reception: as third-wave feminism of the early 1990s reintroduced sex- positivity and Blannbekin‚Äôs Life and Revelations came back into the medievalist spotlight, her work garnered a remarkable amount of support. Before this, eroticism intermingled with Christian revelations were treated disdainfully. Additionally, modern critics are increasingly more concerned with explicating the prejudice (albeit standard) in her work: > Medieval women, like medieval men, had the choice to support or subvert > Christianity‚Äôs efforts to marginalize and persecute groups such as > homosexuals, lepers, Jews, and people of color. Thus, we find Agnes > repeating the widely known legend about the death of sodomites at the birth > of Christ. She repeatedly condemns Jews, presents a negative portrayal of > Ethiopians and associates dark skin with evil, and interprets leprosy as a > sign of moral corruption. When read from the perspective of any of these > marginalized groups, Agnes‚Äôs religious beliefs are put into sharp relief as > an example of Christian hegemonic strategies, often successful, to employ > its subaltern members to its own ends. While this is a mar on the universality of Blannbekin‚Äôs work, it is still an opportunity for scholars of women‚Äôs spirituality to peer into the life of an ‚Äúodd‚Äù beguine who emblemizes common topics of interests in Medieval mysticism.  Death  Blannbekin died in Vienna, Austria on March 10, 1315 in her convent.

He was captain of the Canadian cricket team. Cheema is a big-hitting batsman who also bowls some handy medium pace. Early career He was born and raised in Pakistan. Cheema moved to Canada in the early 2000s and had only ever played cricket at club level but his heavy hitting caught attention in the Toronto and District Cricket Association league. Domestic and T20 franchise career He turned in a noteworthy season in 2005, scoring 627 runs in 14 matches at just under 50, and taking 24 wickets at 13.12. After a disappointing 2006, Cheema established himself as the league's most dangerous batsman the following year with two big hundreds 161 off a scarcely believable 61 balls with eight fours with 15 sixes and an effort of 145 with 15 fours and nine sixes. In 2010, Canada was included in Caribbean T20, the T20 tournament in the West Indies. Due to Ashish Bagai‚Äôs injury, Cheema was named as captain for the tournament which also involves seven teams from the Caribbean. His Canadian team surprised everyone by winning a stirring encounter with England domestic Twenty20 Champions Hampshire cricket club. He has also made the shortlist for the 2010 IPL contract auction; he is one of 51 people to do so from an original list of 97. On 3 June 2018, he was selected to play for the Winnipeg Hawks in the players' draft for the inaugural edition of the Global T20 Canada tournament. In June 2019, he was selected to play for the Vancouver Knights franchise team in the 2019 Global T20 Canada tournament. International career Cheema made his international debut at the age of 30 in the Scotia Bank ODI series in King City, Ontario in August 2008. Cheema came to notice with a 61-ball 89 against West Indies in his second ODI and in the same match also took 3 for 31 in 10 overs which was over shadowed by West Indies cricket team's 303 for 4 which includes century by Xavier Marshall. He followed that up with 61 off 45 balls against the same opposition two days later. He narrowly misses out in a maiden ODI hundred against Netherlands cricket team in July 2009. Later that month Cheema was one of six players awarded central contracts as Cricket Canada sought to professionalise its structures. His in ODI is 114.94 which is the top ten list of the highest number of strike rate. In the Canada T20 tournament, in October 2008, he hit ten sixes, more than either Sanath Jayasuriya or Shahid Afridi and was his team's top run-getter, averaging over 60 in the series. He scored 68 off 43 balls against Sri Lanka in his third game. Cheema was one of the four, Canadian Cricketer who face visa problem before the World Cup. Cheema hit a fluent 93 from 70 balls from No. 7 at Fatullah in a warm cup game against England. In September 2018, he was named in Canada's squad for the 2018‚Äì19 ICC World Twenty20 Americas Qualifier tournament. In August 2019, he was named in Canada's squad for the Regional Finals of the 2018‚Äì19 ICC T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier tournament. In October 2019, he was named in Canada's squad for the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament in the United Arab Emirates. Captaincy career Cheema was named Ashish Bagai‚Äôs deputy for the Canada Tour of Sri Lanka in 2009. He was appointed captain of the national side for the ICC America's Division One Championship 2009/10 in Bermuda in Ashish Bagai's absence that has been rested ahead of what is to be a gruelling push to the 2011 Cricket World Cup. He was appointed as full-time captain of Canada in 2012 where he leads them in World T20 Qualifiers in UAE where Canada finish fourth in the tournament.

Synopsis The story follows the lead characters through their experiences as members of the Police Negotiation Cadre (PNC). The PNC is a volunteer unit of the Hong Kong police force specializing in negotiations with terrorist members, partakers of local violence, and individuals contemplating suicide. The whole series is dotted with both large and small cases handled by the story's heroes and heroines. There is a love square between Pang Kwok-Tung (Bobby Au-Yeung), Kan Kit (Kenix Kwok), Mok Ka- Chung (Moses Chan) and Poon Man-Ching (Winnie Yeung). Bobby Au-Yeung later finds out that Winnie is cheating on him and secretly meeting Moses, Kenix Kwok's husband. Moses and Winnie leave Hong Kong, however, Moses returns to Hong Kong with the news that Winnie has once again separated from her husband and found another man. Yeung Kwong and Ip Ho-Yan have a comical love relationship, and marry in the end. Eventually, Bobby and Kenix get together. Many problems also happen in Yeung Kwong's (Julian Cheung) family. He is not his father's biological son (although he is favoured over his three siblings). Ip Ho-Yan (Annie Man) has a brief relationship with Julian Cheung's brother, Yeung Hau-Mo (Ellesmere Choi), but it ends when Ellesmere Choi cannot forget his previous girlfriend. Ip Ho-Yan and Julian Cheung start off as beginners learning about PNC. Towards the end, they become professional members of the PNC, and even stop their own instructor, Pang Kwok-Tung (Bobby Au-Yeung) from committing suicide.

It is one of a number of armoured electrical cables ‚Äì which include 11 kV Cable and 33 kV Cable ‚Äì and is found in underground systems, power networks and cable ducting. Aluminium can also be used for armouring, and historically iron was used. Armouring is also applied to submarine communications cables. Construction Example of steel wire armoured cables in a UK installation. Blue sheathed cable is normally instrumentation signal, black is power The typical construction of an SWA cable can be broken down as follows: * Conductor: consists of plain stranded copper (cables are classified to indicate the degree of flexibility. Class 2 refers to rigid stranded copper conductors as stipulated by British Standard BS EN 60228:2005British Standard BS EN 60228:2005. bsi-global.com) * Insulation: Cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) is used in a number of power cables because it has good water resistance and excellent electrical properties. Insulation in cables ensures that conductors and other metal substances do not come into contact with each other. * Bedding: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bedding is used to provide a protective boundary between inner and outer layers of the cable. * Armour: Steel wire armour provides mechanical protection, which means the cable can withstand higher stresses, be buried directly and used in external or underground projects. The armouring is normally connected to earth and can sometimes be used as the circuit protective conductor (\\"earth wire\\") for the equipment supplied by cable. * Sheath: a black PVC sheath holds all components of the cable together and provides additional protection from external stresses. The PVC version of SWA cable, described above, meets the requirements of both British Standard BS 5467 and International Electrotechnical Commission standard IEC 60502.IEC 60502-1 Standard. iec.ch (2004) It is known as SWA BS 5467 Cable and it has a voltage rating of 600/1000 V.Trevor Marks (2002) Handbook on BS7671: The IEE Wiring Regulations ‚Äì A Handbook of Compliance. Radikal Phase Publishing House Limited. . p. 358 SWA cable can be referred to more generally as mains cable, armoured cable, power cable and booklet armoured cable. The name power cable, however, applies to a wide range of cables including 6381Y, NYCY, NYY-J and 6491X Cable. Aluminium wire armoured cable Steel wire armour is only used on multicore versions of the cable. A multicore cable, as the name suggests, is one where there are a number of different cores. When cable has only one core, aluminium wire armour (AWA) is used instead of steel wire. This is because the aluminium is non-magnetic. A magnetic field is produced by the current in a single core cable. This would induce an electric current in the steel wire, which could cause overheating. Use of armour for earthing cable with light armouring The use of the armour as the means of providing earthing to the equipment supplied by the cable (a function technically known as the circuit protective conductor or CPC) is a matter of debate within the electrical installation industry. It is sometimes the case that an additional core within the cable is specified as the CPC (for instance, instead of using a two core cable for line and neutral and the armouring as the CPC, a three core cable is used) or an external earth wire is run alongside the cable to serve as the CPC. Primary concerns are the relative conductivity of the armouring compared to the cores (which reduces as the cable size increases) and reliability issues. Recent articles by authoritative sources have analysed the practice in detail and concluded that, for the majority of situations, the armouring is adequate to serve as the CPC under UK wiring regulations.The Use Of The Armour Of Steel Wire Armoured Cables As A Protective Conductor. gadsolutions.bizDarrell Locke (2008) Electrical Research Association Report (ERA) report on armoured cables with external CPCs ‚Äì Appendix 16 in Guide to the Wiring Regulations:17th Edition IEE Wiring Regulations (BS 7671:2008). Wiley. SWA BS 6724 cable The construction of an SWA cable depends on the intended use. When the power cable needs to be installed in a public area, for example, a Low Smoke Zero Halogen (LSZH) equivalent, called SWA BS 6724 Cable must be used. After the King‚Äôs Cross fire in London in 1987 it became mandatory to use LSZH sheathing on all London Underground cables ‚Äì a number of the fatalities were due to toxic gas and smoke inhalation. As a result, LSZH cables are now recommended for use in highly populated enclosed public areas. This is because they emit non-toxic levels of Halogen and low levels of smoke when exposed to fire. SWA Cable BS 6724 ‚Äì which meets the requirements of British standard BS 6724 ‚Äì has LSZH bedding and a black LSZH sheath.  Use in telecommunications  Armoured cable is used for submarine communications cable to protect against damage by fishing vessels and wildlife. Early cables carrying telegraph used iron wire armouring, but later switched to steel. The first of these was a cable across the English Channel laid by the Submarine Telegraph Company in 1851.Smith, Willoughby, The Rise and Extension of Submarine Telegraphy, J.S. Virtue & Company, 1891 . Many more telegraph, and later, telephone cables soon followed with multiple cores. Modern cables are fibre-optic cables rather than copper cores. The first transatlantic fibre- optic cable was TAT-8 in 1988.Bray, John, Innovation and the Communications Revolution: From the Victorian Pioneers to Broadband Internet, p. 244, IET, 2002 .

History =Ancient era= As showed by excavations of ruins of castellieri (walls protecting ancient settlements, on the Sienavecchia height), the origins of Stigliano date to Iron Age times. Scholars have suggested that these structures could have been built by the Etruscans as a defense against the invasion of the Senones. Presence of the latter is confirmed by local toponyms, such as the name of the village Brenna, close to Stigliano, which could stem from the name of their leader Brennus. The name of the local Merse river, which flows behind Stigliano, is potentially directly related to Merseburg, a town in eastern Germany. Orgia and Rosia are both non-roman names, and possibly related to the Lambards times. Although very little is known of Stigliano during the Roman times, the name of Sextilianum which appears in later records, may show the existence of a private property later on giving the name to the village. =Middle Ages= Stigliano is the site for one of the many castles that were part of the Ardenghesca consortium, feudal Lords of Lombard ancestry. In middle age Stigliano was the hub of a network of roads crossing the region, one to Massa Marittima and another following the Rosia river to the Maremma. All routes passed through the village of Torri and Stigliano; traces of the old roads can be seen in the woods near Stigliano. The presence of a monastery at Torri triggered economic growth in the area. The monks carried out an agricultural and industrial revolution, draining the marshes and introducing water mills along the Merse. The river accommodated every sort of hydraulic machinery, but mainly the ones, as forges, related to siderurgy. The abundance of water and woods, so acutely missed by the Siena merchants, influenced the development of Stigliano and the neighbouring villages during the 13th century. These natural resources were of crucial importance for Siena, the major city in the area, who decided finally to take the Ardenghesche lands for its own purposes. The first established industry was that of the Wool Masters, ‚ÄúThe Follatura‚Äù, who signed a contract with the monks at Torri to develop hydraulic machinery along the Merse river. Later on, the river was diverted, to power a serie of huge flour mills, built by the Sienese Common, of which three are still standing: Molino del Pero, near Brenna, Molino Serravalle and Molino del Palazzo. The straight dirt track which goes to San Rocco a Pilli was also built at this time. Some other mills, ‚ÄúSassa‚Äù and ‚ÄúVolta‚Äù, are just ruins. These mills were indispensable for the production of flour to supply Siena. This intricate medieval hydraulic system stretched for kilometers and was one of the most important technical achievements of the Middle Ages in Tuscany. A careful inventory of land properties in 1320, carried out by Siena authorities for taxing purposes, reveals the main source of incomes from this area in middle age: the iron industry. Although still primitive, siderurgy was greatly improved by hydraulic machinery, and reached high levels of sophistication. During this era, Stigliano was an independent commune, owning large areas of woodland and granting permits for allotments to its inhabitants, not only to farmers but also commercial entrepreneurs and merchants. There are documents recording deals of land exchanges with the Sienese as far back at the 13th century. However, after the outbreak of the Black Death in 1348 and the subsequent decline of the population, these achievements were neglected and even the revival of agriculture in the 18th century could not compare with the thriving centre in medieval times. The plague and the subsequent appearance of the ruthless condottieri armies which plundered of the countryside, ruined the synergy between the commune and its lands. Stigliano underwent a stage of refeudalization, and large properties of land were assembled by former merchants and bankers: the Borghese family, who established their master manor in the shape of a stronghold, at Palazzo, and the Pecci, who in Poggiarello edified their own one, the castello del Poggiarello di Stigliano. Further on, a farm of the sienese hospital Santa Maria della Scala was sold to the Placidi(and became an estate said Poderina, rebuilt in neogothic style in XIX century). Another renaissance villa, neglected and transformed in a farmhouse, is in Piaggia, once owned by the Venturi-Gallerani.

His abstract paintings and drawings take a historical cue from post-war European automatism and surrealism, and the influence those movements had on abstract expressionism.Tom Savage biography, Artnet Critical debate The primal, unconscious and disharmonious nature of Savage's technique, which the artist himself has described as the antithesis of that of regionalist painter Thomas Hart Benton,From the documentary short film , October 2008 has proven an interpretive challenge for critics. In his Los Angeles Times review of Savage's 1995 solo exhibition at the Cirrus Gallery in Los Angeles, critic David Pagel described the artist's works as \\"raw, incoherent, precarious and daring.

By extension, it has a range of other functions related to relative velocity calculations. A number of versions of the device were produced and it proved particularly useful for station-keeping, such as ships moving in convoy during World War II. Manufacture of the instruments was contracted to Elliott Brothers, London. Devices based on the Battenberg indicator were also developed for determining course and distance in aviation and when making allowances for aircraft drift due to winds. Instruments were also manufactured for other navies, for example in the USA. Mark I The prototype Battenberg course indicator of 1892. The guide bar and circular disc are at the bottom of the picture; the position bars are at the top and left; the speed bar stretches up and right to meet the almost horizontal diameter grove at the 3 o'clock position Prince Louis of Battenberg employed a firm of London instrument makers to build a prototype to his design. The device comprised: * 2 position bars for setting the initial and final stations * A speed bar, on which the speed of the ship (relative to the flagship) was set, and which was clamped at one end into the diameter grove by the speed ratio clamp * A guide bar * A circular disc To use the instrument, the course of the flagship was first set on the guide bar. When the initial and final stations had been set using the position bars, the speed ratio clamp was set to show the ratio of own ship speed to the speed of the flagship (if the flagship was doing 10 knots, and the manoeuvring ship had 15 knots available, the clamp would be set to \\"1.5\\"). Ensuring that the pin beneath the speed ratio clamp was set within the diameter grove, the course required to take station could then be read off the circular disc. Mark II The Mark II version dispensed with the use of relative speeds and set the guide bar on a sliding speed scale, thus allowing the speed of the guide and the speed of the own ship to be set independently. The device was constructed largely of brass. Mark III The Mark III instrument was constructed of aluminium alloy. Mark IV Similar to Mark III. The circular scale attached to the end of the 'own ship' bar was moved to be part of the pivot assembly so that it is fixed relative to the 'guide bar' instead of being fixed relative to the 'own ship' bar. The 'own ship' bar was redesigned with a pointer on the end to read off the scale. Mark V The Mk V Battenberg course indicator The Mark V instrument dispensed with the guide bar and own ship's bar, retaining only the two position bars. However, the circular base plate was added to by the provision of two celluloid transparent discs which were placed on top of the base and free to rotate. The instrument body was made of an aluminium alloy and had a scale graded in degrees around the outside. The base plate had no scale, but a series of interrupted parallel lines running across it. This device was in production around 1955. One disc was marked with a scale from 0 at the centre to 36 on the outside, in a similar manner to the markings originally etched onto the base plate, except that three marked scales were used, one in a line through the centre and another parallel but half way to the edge either side of the centre line. The markings were then repeated by a second set at right angles to the first. Depending on usage, the marked scale numbers could refer to distance or speed. A second disc was marked with a circular scale all around the edge labelled in degrees, with radial lines from the centre of the disc stretching out every ten degrees. The disc also had concentric circles which coincided with the marked scale on the other disc. To aid clarity, markings on the second disc were in a different colour to those on the first. The rear of the device had a separate rotating calculator, where if the ship's speed was set against the 60-minute guide mark, then the distance travelled at any time 0‚Äì60 minutes could be read off against the logarithmic time scale.

The translation movement took place in Baghdad from the mid- eighth century to the late tenth century. While the movement translated from many languages into Arabic, including: Pahlavi, Sanskrit, Syriac, and Greek, it is often referred to as the Graeco-Arabic translation movement because it was predominantly focused on translating the works of Hellenistic scholars and other secular Greek texts into Arabic.  Pre-Abbasid Developments  = Pre- Islamic developments = The ninth king of the Sasanian Empire, Shapur II, established the Academy of Gondishapur, which was to be a medical center, a library, as well as a college where various subjects like anatomy, theology, medicine, and philosophy would be studied. Later, Khosrow I established an observatory that could offer studies in dentistry, architecture, agriculture and irrigation, basics of commanding in military, astronomy, and mathematics. The Academy of Gondishapur was then considered as the greatest crucial center of medicine during the sixth as well as the seventh century. However, during the seventh century CE, the Sasanian Empire was conquered by the Muslim armies, but they preserved the center. Further west, the Byzantine emperor Justinian I closed the Academy of Athens in 529 CE. Along with the defunding of key public educational institutions, many scholars fled the region with their knowledge and materials. These migrant scholars sought asylum in Persia, whose ruler actively ensured their safe passage out of Byzantium and supported their academic ambitions. = Early Islamic Empire and Umayyad Period (632‚Äì750 CE) = Although Greek to Arabic translations were common during the Umayyad Period due to large, Greek-speaking populations residing in the empire, the translation of Greek scientific texts was scarce. The Graeco-Arabic translation movement began, in earnest, at the beginning of the Abbasid Period. However, many events and conditions during the rise of the Islamic empire helped to shape the setting and circumstances in which the movement blossomed. The Arab conquests before and during the Umayyad Period that spread into Southwest Asia, Persia, and Northeast Africa laid the groundwork for a civilization capable of fueling the Graeco-Arabic translation movement. These conquests united a massive area under the Islamic State, connecting societies and peoples previously isolated, invigorating trade routes and agriculture, and improving material wealth among subjects. The newfound regional stability under the Umayyad dynasty likely fostered higher literacy rates and a larger educational infrastructure. Syriac-speaking Christians and other Hellenistic Christian communities in Iraq and Iran were assimilated into the structure of the empire. These Hellenized peoples were crucial in supporting a growing institutional interest in secular Greek learning.

At the same time, the ruling elite of the new dynasty strove to adopt a Sassanian Imperial Ideology, which itself was also influenced by Greek thought. These factors culminated in a capital more receptive to and actively interested in the knowledge contained in scientific manuscripts of Classical Greece. The advent and rapid spread of papermaking learned from Chinese prisoners of war in 751 CE also helped to make the translation movement possible. The translation movement in Arab progressed in development during the Abbasid period. The Abbasid period encompassed one of the very critical markers in the movement's history, that is, the translation of the central texts of the Islamic religion, in this case, the Quran. The translation movement in Arab was a movement that was greatly supported under the rule of Islamic, which caused the translation of materials to Arabic from different languages like middle Persian. The translation movement was instigated by the Barmakids. Available documents depict that Persian texts were greatly privileged by the translation movement. The movement succeeded in forming civilization overlap and initiated new maps in the fields of culture and politics. Islamic rulers participated in the movement in numerous ways, for example, creating classes for translation to facilitate its flow all through the various phases of the Islamic empires. The translation movement had a significant effect on developing the scientific knowledge of the Arabs since several theories in science had surfaced from various origins. Late, there was the introduction of the western culture to the Arabic translations that were preserved since most of their initial scripts could not be located. Khalidi and Dajani (2015) argue that one of the last empires of Persia before Islam was the Sasanian Empire. Before Islam rose, there was no system for Arabic writing. Arabs could learn different languages, like Syriac as well as Aramaic, to attainability to communicate effectively whenever they were out for trading. They made their journey in what was referred to as summer and winter caravans. Normally in these journeys, one of the Arab tribes that were considered to be famous - such as the Quraysh - would lead them. The translation is known to date back to when the second century was at the helm. This is the time when the Syriacs are believed to have transformed their original customs as well as beliefs into Arabic. The golden age of Islam was regarded as the landmark for the translation movement. Muhammad, the founding prophet of Islam, delivered information to various political leaders as well as societies such as Persia, Rome, and Syria, which neither spoke nor understood Arabic, requesting them to consider the adoption of Islam. This resulted in Muhammad searching for private scribes who would translate from Arabic. This motivated Muslims to acquire and learn new foreign languages. Zayd ibn Thabit, who was the most competent of Muhammad's scribes entitled to Muhammad, translated to Persian, Syriac, as well as Hebrew in order to ease communication with jews. The major criteria that Islam incorporated were to motivate others to look for knowledge since they thought that understanding how Allah related to the creation was the most appropriate way of understanding the universe. This criterion was a significant concept that motivated the spreading of their religion throughout the world. When Muhammad died in 632 CE, caliphs that were considered Rightly Guided Caliphs were chosen to lead the Empire of Islam, the information of the Quran was becoming more known in the surrounding civilizations. There was an expansion of the Islamic empire, leading to searching of multilingual teachers as well as people to translate and teach the Quran and the Arabic language. Later, the Quran would be incorporated into one language. Translation attained more propulsion in the times of Umayyad, and therefore, Arab rose to be the official as well as the popular language in the Islamic Empire. Arabs were now facing the Greek's knowledge, the majority originating from the scholars that remained during the period of Byzantine. The main factor that led to the translation of the Arabic materials were the Syriacs since, as the Arabs could not understand the language in Greek, Syriacs had understood the language for more than ten centuries. When the fourth Umayyad caliph ruled as a king, translating the documents that were regarded official, as well as treaties in astronomy and medicine, began to happen. The songs in Byzantine and Persian were translated too. During this period, Greek gnomologia, such as Aristotle's, were translated and affected the poetry in Arabic later. A polyglot who was considered to be fluent in almost all the targeted languages was regarded as among the greatest translators during that time. He majored in the medical field. Through a hand from his son, Ishaq Hunayn, as well as his nephew, Habash, he translated more than ninety-five pieces of Galen, almost fifteen pieces of Hippocrates, about the soul, and about generation as well as corruption. The Arabic language extensively expanded to reach communities in places such as Morocco and Andalusia and would later be adapted as their language that was regarded as official. The Umayyad caliphs greatly helped in translating science as well as arts, which gave out a long-term foundation for the Empire of Islam. While Islam expanded, there was the preservation of other cultures by the Muslims and the utilization of technology and their knowledge of science in the efforts of stimulating their language to develop. Julius K√∂ckert: Harun al-Rashid receiving a delegation from Charlemagne in 768, oil on canvas (1864; Maximilianeum, Munich) The translation movement of the Arabs continually developed through the Abbasid period. This period encompassed the most significant markers in the movement history, that is, the translation of the major religious text of Islam, the Quran. The second Abbasis caliph, Abu Muhammad al-Mansur, relocated the capital to Baghdad from where it was, that is, Damascus. In Baghdad, he commanded most of the science and philosophy articles to be translated and other literature that was in Greek, Persian, as well as Syriac languages into Arabic. During the rule of the fifth caliph, Harun, they established the House of Wisdom to be the library for the many books that were translated. This house, however, borrowed much from the Academy of Gondishapur by incorporating its previous graduates. The House of Wisdom was later transformed into a centre of translation. = The House of Wisdom = The \\"House of Wisdom\\" (Bayt al-Hikmah) was a major intellectual center during the reign of the Abbasids and was a major component of the Translation Movement and the Islamic Golden Age. The library was filled with many different authors and translated books from the Greek, Persian, and Indian civilizations. The translation process in the House of Wisdom was very meticulous. Depending on the area of study of a certain book that was being translated, a specific person or group of people would be responsible for those translations. In example, the translation of engineering and mathematical works was overseen by Ab≈´ Ja øfar Ibn M≈´sa Ibn ShƒÅkir and his family, translations of philosophy and celestial movement was given to Ibn FarkhƒÅn al-Tabarƒ´ and Ya øq≈´b al-Kindƒ´, and Ibn IshƒÅq al-HarƒÅnƒ´ was in charge of translations involving the study of medicine. These translators were also from many different cultural, religious, and ethnic backgrounds, including Persians, Christians, and Muslims, all working to develop a well-rounded inventory of educational literature in the House of Wisdom for the Abbasid Caliphate. Once translation was finished the books would need to be copied and bound. The translation would be sent to an individual with very precise and skillful handwriting abilities. When finished, the pages would be bound together with a cover and decorated and would be catalogued and placed in a specific ward of the library. Multiple copies of the book would also be made to be distributed across the empire. The populace pays allegiance to the new Abbasid Caliph, al-Ma ømun, Historically, the House of Wisdom is a story of many successes. In 750 AD, the Abbasid's overthrew the Ummayad Caliphate, becoming the ruling power in the Islamic world. In 762 AD, Abu Ja øfar Abdallah ibn Muhammad al-Mansur, the second Abbasid Caliph, decided to move the capital of the empire to his newly built city of Baghdad in Iraq from Damascus, which was in Syria. Al-Mansur was very cognizant of the need to cultivate intellect and wanted to advance and magnify the status of the Islamic people and their culture. As a result, he established a library, the House of Wisdom, in Baghdad where scholars and students could study new material, formulate new ideas, transcribe literature of their own, and translate various works from around the world into the Arabic language. Al-Mansur's descendants were also active in the cultivation of intellect, especially in the area of translation. Under the rule of Abu al-Abbas Abdallah ibn Harun al-Rashid (better known as al-Ma ømun) the House of Wisdom thrived, acquiring a large amount of support and recognition. Al-Ma ømun would send scholars all over the civilized world to retrieve various scientific and literary works to be translated. The head translator at the time, Hunayn ibn Ishaq al-Ibadi, who was a Christian of al- Hira, is believed to have translated over one hundred books, including the work On Anatomy of the Veins and Arteries by Galen. Due to the translation movement under al-Ma ømun, the House of Wisdom was one of the largest repositories of scientific and literary books in the world at the time and remained that way until the Siege of Baghdad in 1258 AD. The destruction and pillaging of Baghdad by the Mongols also included the destruction of the House of Wisdom, however, the books and other works inside were taken to Maragha by Hulagu Khan and Nasir al-Din al-Tusi. = Notable Translators = ; Abu Zaid Hunayn ibn Ishaq al-Ibadi Hunayn's Introduction to the Art of Galen, Oxford, 13th Century Abu Zaid Hunayn ibn Ishaq al-Ibadi was a profound physician, philosopher, author and leading translator in the House of Wisdom . He was born at Hira (Iraq) in 809 AD and spent most of his youth in Basra where he learned Arabic and Syriac. He was affiliated with the Syrian Nestorian Christian Church, and was brought up as a Nestorian Christian long before the rise of Islam. Hunayn was eager to continue his education, so he followed his father's footsteps and moved to Baghdad to study medicine. Hunayn was an important figure in the evolution of Arabic Medicine and was best known for his translations of famous Greek and Middle Eastern authors. He had a complete mastery of Greek, which was the science language of the time. Hunayn's knowledge of Persian, Syriac, and Arabic exceeded that of previous prevalent translators, which enabled him to revise their erroneous renditions. Galen, Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle, Dioscorides, and Ptolemy were just a few of many writers that Hunayn used for his translated publications of medical and philosophical expositions. These translated treatises, in turn, became the backbone of Arabic Science. As he began his path into medicine in Baghdad, he had the privilege to study under one of the most renowned physicians in the city, Y≈´hannƒÅ ibn MƒÅssawayh. Y≈´hannƒÅ and his colleagues dedicated their lives to the field of medicine. They showed little to no respect to the people of Hira where Hunayn was from because Hira was known to be a city flourished by commerce and banking rather than science and medicine. Due to this, he did not take Hunayn seriously as a student. Hunayn was a highly intelligent person who paid very close attention to detail and found many mistakes in his assigned medical textbooks, so would often ask difficult questions no one at his school had the answer to. Eventually, Y≈´hannƒÅ became so frustrated that he gave up his rights as his teacher and blatantly told Hunayn that he does not have the ability to pursue this career. Hunayn had a strong mindset and refused to let Y≈´hannƒÅ get in his way. He left Baghdad for several years, and during his absence he studied the history and language of Greek. When he returned, he displayed his newly acquired skills by being able to recite and translate the works of Homer and Galen. He began translating a large number of Galen's texts including ‚ÄúAnatomy of the Veins and Arteries‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnatomy of the Muscles‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnatomy of the Nerves‚Äù, ‚ÄúOn Sect‚Äù, and many more in the upcoming future. Everyone was astonished at his amazing talent especially Y≈´hannƒÅ, so the two reconciled and would later collaborate on several occasions. Hunayn, his son Ishaq, his nephew Hubaysh, and fellow colleague Isa ibn Uahya became very involved in translating medicinal and science texts. This led to the beginning of Hunayn's success into the translation movement, where he interpreted the works of famous Greek and Arabic figures: Plato, Aristotle, Hippocrates, Galen, and Dioscorides. He was also constantly fixing defective manuscripts translated by other writers. Hunayn would collect different books based around the subject he was translating, and strove to make the text as clear as possible for readers. Because his translation methods were impeccable, it was not long until Hunayn became famous. Unlike other translators during the Abbasid period, he did not translate texts word for word. Hunayn had a specific way of absorbing information by attempting to attain the meaning of the subject prior to rewriting it, which was very rare to witness during his time. After he grasped a proficient understanding of the piece, he would rephrase his knowledge of it in either the Syriac or Arabic language onto a new manuscript. Hunayn, his son Ishaq Ibn Hunayn, his nephew Hubaysh Ibn al- Hasan al-A øsam, and fellow colleague Isa Ibn Uahya became very involved in working together on translating medicinal, science, and philosophical texts. Ishaq and Hunayn were important contributors in Hunayn's translations and active members of his school. His son mastered the Greek, Arabic, and Syriac language to be able to follow into father's footsteps. At the beginning of his career, Hunayn was very critical of his son's work, and even corrected his Arabic translations of \\"On the Number of Syllogisms\\". However, Ishaq was more interested in philosophy and would go on to translate several famous philosophical writings such as That the Prime Mover is Immobile and pieces of Galen's On Demonstration. He continued his passion for translations even after his father's death in 873 AD.  Ramifications of the Translation Movement  = Lack of original Greek texts = From the middle of the eighth century to the end of the tenth century, a very large amount of non-literary and non- historical secular Greek books were translated into Arabic. These included books that were accessible throughout the Eastern Byzantine Empire and the near east, according to the documentation from a century and a half of Graeco- Arabic scholarship. The Greek writings from Hellenistic, Roman, and late antiquity times that did not survive in the original Greek text were all vulnerable to the translator and the powers they had over them when completing the translation. It was not uncommon to come across Arabic translators who added their own thoughts and ideas into the translations. Ninth century Arab Muslim philosopher al-Kindi, for example, viewed Greek texts as a resource in which he was able to employ new ideas and methods off of, thus, re-inventing philosophy. Al-Kindi used the Greek texts as outlines used to fix the weaknesses and finish what they left unfinished. Translating also meant new information could be added in, while some could potentially be taken out depending on what the translator's goal was. Another example of this is found in the Arabic translator's approach to Ptolemy's astronomy in the Almagest. The Almagest was critiqued and modified by Arabic astronomers for many generations. The modifications were made based on Greek thought, most coming from Aristotle. As a result, this led to many new developments. When discussing the development of Arabic science, Greek heritage is an important area to cover. At the same time, in order to receive a complete understanding of Greek science there are parts that have only survived in Arabic that must also be taken into account. For example, Apollonius' Conics books V to VII and Diophantus' Arithmetica books IV to VII. The two listed are items of Greek origin that have only survived in their Arabic translation. The circumstance is the same for the relationship between Latin and Greek science, which requires the analysis of Greek texts translated into Arabic and then into Latin. Translation entails viewpoints from one angle, the angle of the one performing the translation. The full analysis and journey of the translated pieces are key components in the overarching theme behind the piece.

In the early 1930s Westfalen was converted into a seaplane tender to serve as a weather reporting and refueling station for Dornier Wal flying boats of Deutsche Luft Hansa carrying mail across the Atlantic between Europe and South America. The conversion of the Westfalen consisted of a large retractable stern mounted canvas drag apron for the flying boat to taxi on (i.e. for use in heavy seas and so the ship did not have to come to dead stop), cranes to lift the flying boats out of the water to be refueled and serviced, and a large compressed air catapult for launching the aircraft.\\"Floating Airport Ready For Atlantic Flyers\\" Popular Science, March 1933 When in operation, Westfalen cruised 900 miles in the middle of the South Atlantic between Bathhurst, Gambia (now Banjul) and Pernambuco, Brazil.

He represented the Leeward Islands cricket team regularly in the Red Stripe Cup during the 1990s and played for his home island of Nevis in the inaugural Stanford 20/20, held in 2006, where they were surprise Semi Finalists. Cricket career Phillip took part in the Leeward's winning Red Stripe Cup campaigns of 1993/94 and 1995/96. He played a big part in the 1995/96 Cup Final against Trinidad and Tobago by taking three wickets in the fourth innings which helped his team to win by 73 runs. Perhaps the biggest scalp of his career was Aravinda de Silva, whom he dismissed when the Leeward Islands took on the touring Sri Lankans at St John's in 1997. He has also taken the wicket of Trinidadian Brian Lara, bowling him in a Red Stripe match which the Leeward Islands won. His best performance in a match came during the 1994/95 Red Stripe Cup when he was Man of the Match after taking match figures of 13 for 123 against Jamaica. Eight of those wickets came in the first innings, at the expense of 92 runs and he took the other five when Jamaica followed on. At the time of his last first- class appearance, only Andy Roberts has taken better match and innings bowling analysis for the Leeward Islands than Phillip. It was a good season for Phillip, with his tally of 28 wickets at 15.50 only bettered in 1996/97 when he took 35 wickets, but at a more expensive average of 29.25. Wife's murder On 16 February 2006 in Nevis, Phillip's wife Shermel was found dead in the back of her car. The throat of his wife of four years had been slashed and Phillip was arrested and charged by police. On 15 November 2008, a jury in Charlestown found Phillip guilty of murder, and he was due to be sentenced on 22 December 2008, but this was deferred to 6 February 2009.

Access  The wetland is located close to the city of Rupnagar, 45 km northwest of Chandigarh City, in Rupnagar and Nawanshahr districts of Punjab. Chandigarh is the nearest airport, which connects it to the rest of India.  History  An archaeological museum of the Archaeological Survey of India at Ropar has displays of the antiquities unearthed during the excavations of mound in the area along with photographs displaying excavation material. The Museum depicts a sequence of six cultural periods or phases, with some breaks from Harappan times to the present day, found in the ancient mound known as Nalagarh Tibbi overlaying the Shiwalik (also spelt Sivalik) deposition on the left bank of the Satluj River where it emerges into the plains. A deep well with a stone inscription of Emperor Shah Jahan (AD 1627-1658) has been located at the foot of the mound.

The wetland is surrounded by hills in the North West and by plain area in the South and South East. Agricultural crops such as wheat, rice, sugarcane, sorghum etc., are grown in the farm lands in the area surrounding the wetland but the hills have thin vegetation and are exposed to intensive grazing.  Hydrology  Climatically, the drainage area of the wetland falls under semi-arid zone of Punjab with mean annual rainfall of 1518 mm. Initially, in the year 1882, a small headwork was constructed on the right bank of Sutlej River, near Ropar town, to supply water to Sirhind Canal. Subsequently, in 1952, a head regulator was constructed to divert water not only to the Bist Doab Canal but also to Sirhind Canal and to the Bhakra Main Canal (upstream of the wetland), for irrigation, industrial and domestic use. Water quality Water quality that determines the health of ecosystem of the wetland was monitored by the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) in the year 1998-99. The water quality was reported to be of 'A' category as the river entered into Punjab and deteriorated to 'D' category downstream of Ropar Lake, mainly due to the industrial effluents from a number of factories and industrial units. Further studies on physico-chemical analysis of important parameters, biological estimations as well as pesticide residue analysis have been initiated.  Flora and fauna  The wetland is rich in flora and fauna which are categorized below. = Flora = A total of 19 species of trees and 14 species of bushes and grasses are recorded. Of these, the tree species are Acacia catechu, Ameles modesta, Acacia nilotica, Albizzia lebbek Azadirachta indica, Bombax ceiba, Cassia fistula, Dalbergia sissoo, Eucalyptus tereticornis, Ficus benghalensis, Ficus religiosa, Mangifera indica, Melia azedarach, Moringa oleifera, Morus indica, Prosopis juliflora, Salix (willow), Syzygium cumini (jambul) and Zizyphus jujuba. = Aquafauna = Wetland is a major source of fisheries since large species of fishes have been recorded; some of the commercially important ones are: Rohu; Labeo gonius Seerha; Labeo calbasu Kalbans or Dhai; Labeo dero Gid; Labeo dyocheilus (Kunni); Catla catla Thal; Cirrhinus mrigala Mori; Puntius sarana Puthi; Cyprinus carpio communis (common carp); Cyprinus carpio spacularis (Mirror carp); Ceenopharyngodon idelle (grass carp); wallago attu Mali; Aorichthys seenghala Sangarha; Mastacembelus armatus Sam (Tire track eel); Ambasis ranga Shisha Mach; Channa punctatus Dolla (snake headed fish); and Channa striata Curd.

Some of the rare migratory birds are: golden-backed woodpecker (Dinopium benghalense, crimson-breasted barbet (Megalaima haemacephala) and green barbet (Stactolaema olivacea). =Fauna= Two species of tortoise (Geoclemys hamiltonii and Chitra indica both endangered), five species of lizards, eleven species of snakes including the threatened Python molurus or Indian python or ajgar are found in the wetland. Food chain The food chain in the wetland is basically well balanced as it has both deep water and shallow water characteristics and the ecosystem is stated to be > almost self sufficient and self-regulating. A Scientific study of the food chain has brought out the following sequence of facts. * Sunlight, pH, inorganic salts, nutrients and dissolved gases are the main abiotic components of the wetland ecosystems with the organic matter caused by the death and decay of animals and plants accumulating at the bottom of the lake * Decomposition at the bottom of the lake takes place due to a variety of heterotrophic microbes such as bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi; Aspergillus sp., Rhizopus sp., Curvularia sp., Paecilomyces sp., Saprolegnia sp. etc. are main species causing the decomposition * The producers of organic matter are the eutrophic green plants and some photosynthetic bacteria; the rooted submerged, floating and emergent hydrophytes being the Typha sp., Eleocharis sp., Sagittaria sp., Nymphaea sp., Potamogeton sp., Vallisneria sp., Eichhornia sp., Lemna sp. etc. and minute, floating or suspended lower plants like filamentous algae, diatoms, chlorococcales and flagellates. * Herbivores such as the mollusks, crustaceans, rotifers and some insects are the primary consumers which feed directly on plants. * Plant remains and organic matter nourish detritivores like the Chironomidae sp., mollusks, mites, some crustaceans and small fishes * Marginal rooted macrophytes are consumed by mammals such as buffaloes, cows etc. which frequent the shores of the lake * Hydrophytes are also the food source of some birds *Carnivores like the Predator beetles and bugs, dragonflies are the secondary consumers which feed on insects, mollusks, rotifers and crustaceans. Carnivorous fishes also belong to this category * Large carnivorous fishes and birds are the tertiary consumers which feed on small fishes and insects. * Top most consumer level is that of the human being and the fish eating birds, which feed mainly on fishes  Adverse impacts on the wetland  Over the years several adverse impacts on the quality of the wetland have been reported. Some of the important ones which invited remedial actions are: * Acute problems of siltation from the adjoining barren and fragile hills. Bare hills of the catchment are subject to continuous erosion leading to shrinkage of wetland area. * Unwarranted interference with the resident and migratory birds * Unauthorized fishing and poaching of wildlife causing damage to species * Increase in effluents from industrializatation in the upstream area of the wetland, such as the Fertilizer plant at Nangal and Thermal Power Plant at Ropar * Effluents of chemical pollutants like agrochemical residues run off, industrial effluents and sewage from some towns in the upper reaches of the wetland * Growth of Invasive weeds  Restoration measures  The Punjab State Council for Science & Technology has evolved several conservation programmes with support from the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoE&F;) of the Govt of India. Some of the programmes implemented include mass awareness campaigns and promotion of public participation in the wetland conservation. A few of the measures planned and under various stages of implementation are: * Afforestation and soil conservation in the highly erosion prone catchment areas of the wetland, * To erect chain-link fencing of strategic areas of the wetland to prevent exploitation of vital wetland resources and prevent encroachments of the wetland * detailed survey, including remote sensing survey and preparation of comprehensive maps * Detailed taxonomic studies of plant and animal species * Introduce fish species sustain fragile relationship between the fish level and the other biotic resources like birds and primary producers and to set up new fish seed farms in addition to refurbish the existing ponds. * Economic assessment  Gallery  File:Python molurus molurus 2.jpgIndian python (Python molurus molurus, Near threatened species) File:Sycomoros old.jpgFicus tree or fig tree File:Konnamaram.JPG Golden Shower Tree (Cassia fistula) File:Semal (Bombax ceiba)- Trunk of a Young tree in Kolkata W IMG 9725.jpgBombax ceiba (Cotton tree) File:Wallago attu 1.jpgWallago attu, a species of catfish File:Megalaima haemacephala 6238.jpgCoppersmith barbet (Megalaima haemacephala) File:Geoclemys hamiltonii.jpgGeoclemys hamiltonii (spotted pond turtle) File:Migratory birds at Ropar Wetland 07.jpgMigratory birds at Ropar Wetland -January 2018 File:Migratory birds at Ropar Wetland 03.jpgMigratory birds at Ropar Wetland File:Migratory birds at Ropar Wetland 01.jpgMigratory birds at Ropar Wetland File:Migratory birds at Ropar Wetland 02.jpgMigratory birds at Ropar Wetland File:Ropar Wetland 02.jpgRopar Wetland -Dec, 2017 File:Ropar Wetland 03.jpgRopar Wetland - Dec, 2017  See also  * Wetland * Kanjli Wetland * Harike Wetland  References  Category:Wetlands of India Category:Ramsar sites in India Category:Landforms of Punjab, India Category:Lakes of Punjab, India Category:Constructed wetlands Category:Reservoirs in India Category:Tourist attractions in Punjab, India ","title":"Ropar Wetland"},{"id":"20093058","text":"Martin Muwanga (born October 20, 1983) is a Ugandan football striker.

Produced by four Toronto men in a commercial venture, the Gay Publishing Company, Gay ran serious articles, letters to the editor, a diary, gossip columns, a feature called the \\"Gabrial Club\\", poetry, fiction, politics and a discrete personals column. Gay was illustrated, usually with photographs of drag queens, but also including 'physique' photography. Intended for a 'mainstream' gay audience it reflected cautious reformism, defending the rights and normalcy of a constituency living in a hostile environment. This was not unlike the political activism emerging in a few large American and European cities before more confrontational activism. Gay also published on Toronto police raids on bars, and on the calls for social and political change that were beginning to surface. The first five-hundred-copy issue sold out almost immediately. Printing two thousand copies by issue three, distributed to a number of outlets in Toronto and Montreal. Shortly, Gay expanded into the United States as Gay International. It quickly outstripped American publications' distributions, and by the spring of 1965 it was publishing twenty thousand copies across North America and selling about eight thousand. Publication ended in 1966 when criminal charges were levied against one of its central creators.

The compound has been studied in animals, but safety and efficacy in humans have not been established. Animal research In animal models of obesity and diabetes SRT1720 was found to improve insulin sensitivity and lower plasma glucose levels in fat, muscle and liver tissue, and increase mitochondrial and metabolic function. In mice rendered obese and diabetic by feeding a high-fat, high-sugar diet, a study performed at the National Institute of Aging found that feeding chow infused with the highest dose of SRT1720 beginning at one year of age increased mean lifespan by 18%, and maximum lifespan by 5%, as compared to other short-lived obese, diabetic mice; however, treated animals still lived substantially shorter lives than normal-weight mice fed normal chow with no drug. In a later study, SRT1720 increased mean lifespan of obese, diabetic mice by 21.7%, similar to the earlier study, but there was no effect on maximum lifespan in this study. In normal-weight mice fed a standard rodent diet, SRT1720 increased mean lifespan by just 8.8%, and again had no effect on maximum lifespan. Since the discovery of SRT1720, the claim that this compound is a SIRT1 activator has been questioned and further defended. Although SRT1720 is not currently undergoing clinical development, a related compound, SRT2104, is currently in clinical development for metabolic diseases.

There were a total of 35 matches played in the men's division and 26 matches played in the women's division. The men's division was split into two stages (in addition to finals) with each side playing each other once before being split into two groups, the top four and the bottom three. The top four sides progressed to a Super 4's stage where they again played each other once in order to be ranked for the semi finals. The semi finals featured Australia, England, New Zealand and South Africa with Australia defeating South Africa in the final to record their sixth consecutive World Cup. The top three sides contested a subsidiary title, won by England. Whilst the women's division was not split into separate stages it did employ a more complicated semi final system that gave all five nations the opportunity of progressing through to the final during the finals stage. South Africa advanced straight through to the final after defeating Australia in the semi finals stage, though Australia then prevailed over New Zealand and were able to reverse their semi final result to defeat South Africa in the final. This was the fifth consecutive World Cup for Australia. The 2007 Junior World Series of Indoor Cricket was held alongside this event. Host Selection The World Cup was awarded to England by the WICF at the conclusion of the previous World Cup. As a result England became the first nation to host the World Cup twice having held the first tournament in 1995. =Venue= The England Indoor Cricket Association determined that the Action Indoor Sports Stadium in Bristol would host all World Cup matches and Bristol became the host city as a result.

The World Cup Plate final was contested between the loser of the bronze medal match and the highest ranked side from the bottom three during the Super 4's stage. The women's division employed a slightly more complicated format. The fourth and fifth placed sides faced off against one another with the winner taking on third place to earn a right in the preliminary final.

This final was the sixth consecutive appearance in a World Cup final and was the first for South Africa. Despite performing below expectations early in the tournament, Australia easily accounted for England in their semi final. The South African side, on the other hand, came through a tough encounter with the New Zealand side by just three runs. In the end, Australia managed a narrow but comfortable victory to claim their sixth consecutive title. World Cup Plate A secondary and subordinate final was played between England (the loser of the bronze medal match) and France (the highest ranked side from the bottom three teams). England rebounded from their heavy loss against New Zealand in the bronze medal match to claim the first Plate title. Women's Division The Women's World Cup Final featured Australia and South Africa. South Africa entered the side as favourites having accounted for Australia in all but one of their encounters in the earlier stages of the World Cup. Australia, however, rebounded and managed to claim their fifth consecutive World Cup title. Player of the tournament Nineteen year old Lee Irwin of Australia was awarded player of the tournament.

It is connected to Heathrow Terminals 2 and 3 by the vehicular Heathrow Cargo Tunnel, and by rail with the Heathrow Terminal 4 tube and Heathrow Terminal 4 railway stations. Built at a cost of ¬£200 million, Terminal 4 was opened by the Prince and Princess of Wales on 1 April 1986.Above Us The Skies: The Story Of BAA ‚Äì 1991 (Michael Donne ‚Äì BAA plc), p. 40 British Airways was the main airline operating from the terminal from 1986 until its move to Terminal 5 on 29 October 2009, eventually making Terminal 4 the Heathrow base for airlines of the SkyTeam airline alliance. Overview =Terminal design= The terminal was initially designed as a facility for short-haul 'point-to-point' traffic, to compensate for its relatively long distance from the airport's central terminal area (CTA). The layout of the terminal, with passenger boarding gates very close to the check-in and security halls, was designed to facilitate rapid movement of passengers through the building (a requirement for short-haul, business-focused flights). Upon opening, it boasted other innovations including the complete segregation of arriving and departing passengers and a departure concourse over long.Above Us The Skies: The Story Of BAA ‚Äì 1991 (Michael Donne ‚Äì BAA plc), p. 41 Lord King, then Chairman of British Airways, demanded that Terminal 4 be solely for the use of British Airways to fulfill the airline's ambition of hosting all its flights in one terminal (an ambition that still has not been achieved even with the opening of Terminal 5 in 2008). A similar demand was made on the North Terminal at Gatwick. Terminal 4's distance from the CTA and design were ill-suited for British Airways' long-haul operations and could be seen as a contributor to the airline's dire operational performance, particularly in the years up to Terminal 5's opening in 2008. For example, passengers had to transfer between Terminal 4 and the CTA by bus rather than by a short moving walkway (as between Terminals 1 and 3 for example) and once inside Terminal 4, the gate areas are not large enough for the 400+ passengers waiting to board the waiting Boeing 747s. Passengers' baggage also had to make the trip by van, sometimes resulting in the luggage being mislaid, although this problem was somewhat alleviated in the late 1990s by the construction of an automated transfer tunnel between the CTA and Terminal 4. =Improvements and renovations= Following the transfer of most of British Airways' flights to Terminal 5 during 2008, Terminal 4 underwent a ¬£200m upgrade to enable it to accommodate 45 airlines and serve as the base for the SkyTeam airline alliance. The departures forecourt has been upgraded to reduce traffic congestion and improve security and an extended check-in area opened in late 2009. Most internal areas of the terminal were renovated between 2009 and 2014, whilst a new SkyTeam Alliance passenger lounge for premium passengers opened in 2009, more recently followed by the Etihad Airways Lounge. A Malaysia Airlines Golden Lounge, Gulf Air Golden Falcon Lounge, Qatar Airways Premium Lounge and Plaza Premium Lounge have all opened since 2010. Two new stands to accommodate the Airbus A380 were constructed in 2009, and a further two opened in 2015. A new baggage system has also been installed. Refurbishment of the arrivals areas is ongoing as of early 2016. = Temporary Closure = In 2020 due to the Coronavirus Pandemic, all flights from Terminal 4 were suspended and consequently, rail and tube services to Terminal 4 station were withdrawn; TfL Rail services diverted to T5. Heathrow also closed one of its runways in response to the drop in flights. Usage Terminal 4 interior, prior to refurbishment in 2012 Arrivals at Terminal 4, prior to refurbishment in 2012 =SkyTeam= All SkyTeam members with operations at Heathrow fly from Terminal 4, with the exceptions of Middle East Airlines and Delta Air Lines which use Terminal 3. The latter vacated to Terminal 3 on 14 September 2016 to ease connections with partner Virgin Atlantic.http://atwonline.com/airlines/delta-consolidate-london-heathrow- operations =Oneworld= Three Oneworld members fly out of Terminal 4, Malaysia Airlines, Royal Air Maroc and Qatar Airways. All have joined the alliance since moving to Terminal 4. Sri Lankan Airlines formerly operated from Terminal 4 but shortly after it joined Oneworld in 2014 it transferred its flights to Terminal 3. =Star Alliance= No Star Alliance airlines currently have presence in Terminal 4. Previously, Air India moved its flights to Terminal 2 on 25 January 2017 after joining Star Alliance in 2014. United Airlines also previously operated from this terminal until it moved to Terminal 2 on 4 June 2014. =Non-aligned= The principal non-aligned airlines are Etihad Airways, Royal Brunei Airlines, El Al, Gulf Air and Oman Air. Ground transportation Heathrow Terminal 4 Underground station =Road links= Terminal 4 is accessed from Junction 14 of the M25 motorway via the A3113 and then the Southern Perimeter Road. It is also accessible from Central London via the M4, exiting at Junction 3. There is a short stay car park directly opposite the terminal and a long stay car park on the other side of the twin rivers. =Rail links= Terminal 4 is served by Heathrow Terminal 4 Underground station on the London Underground's Piccadilly line and by Heathrow Express trains at Heathrow Terminal 4. Heathrow Express provides a free shuttle service to Heathrow Central station. At Heathrow Central, passengers can change for free services to Terminal 5, and also for the main Heathrow Express service to Paddington or the TfL Rail (formally Heathrow Connect) stopping service. As of February 2019, a standard adult single ticket to Paddington on Heathrow Express is ¬£25.00 (¬£22.00 off-peak) if purchased before travel, or ¬£27.00 if purchased on the train. The Piccadilly line has up to six trains per hour (about every 10 minutes) in the direction of Cockfosters via central London. Trains to central London run via Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3\\\\. They may wait at Heathrow Terminal 4 for up to eight minutes. Although the journey takes longer, fares are much cheaper than on the Heathrow Express service. As of February 2019, adult single fares to central London stations range from ¬£3.10 to ¬£6.00, depending on the time of day and whether or not a contactless payment card (including the Oyster card or Tfl Oyster App) is used. =Bus links= Terminal 4 is served by some local buses, coach services and car parking.

Terminal 3 arrivals area Terminal 3 was opened as the Oceanic Terminal on 13 November 1961; it was built to handle flight departures for long-haul routes. Renamed Terminal 3 in 1968, it was expanded in 1970 with the addition of an arrivals building. Other facilities added included the UK's first moving walkways. BOAC and the two US airlines, Pan American World Airways and Trans World Airlines (TWA), dominated operations at the terminal throughout the 1960s and 1970s. In 1969 the terminal was renovated to handle the new Boeing 747 which was introduced to the airport on 23 January 1970. Pan American sold its Heathrow landing rights to United Airlines in 1990 and TWA sold its to American Airlines in 1992. The terminal was refurbished between 1987 and 1990 at a cost of ¬£110 million. In 2006, the new ¬£105 million Pier 6 was completed to accommodate the Airbus A380 superjumbo; Emirates and Qantas now operate regular flights from Terminal 3 using the Airbus A380. Redevelopment of Terminal 3's forecourt through the addition of a new four- lane drop-off area and a large pedestrianised plaza, complete with canopy to the front of the terminal building, was completed in 2007. These improvements were intended to improve passengers' experiences, reduce traffic congestion and improve security. As part of this project, Virgin Atlantic was assigned its own dedicated check-in area, known as 'Zone A', which features a large sculpture and atrium. As of 2013, Terminal 3 has an area of . Heathrow Airport Limited also has plans for a ¬£1bn upgrade of the rest of the terminal over the next ten years which will include the renovation of aircraft piers and the arrivals forecourt. A new baggage system connecting to Terminal 5 (for British Airways connections) is currently under construction. In addition to the baggage system, the baggage claim hall is also set to undergo changes with dedicated A380 belts and an improved design and layout. In 2020 due to the Coronavirus Pandemic, all flights from Terminal 3 were suspended and flights moved to Terminals 2 and 5. The railway and tube station remained open to serve Terminal 2 . Usage The main presences in Terminal 3 are American Airlines and Virgin Atlantic, which Heathrow is a focus city for. British Airways, Emirates, Delta Air Lines, Cathay Pacific and Qantas are the other major users of the terminal. =Oneworld= Terminal 3 is used by the majority of the members of the Oneworld airline alliance: American Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Finnair, Japan Airlines, LATAM (leaving Oneworld on 1 May 2020), Qantas, Royal Jordanian, and SriLankan Airlines. British Airways, which also uses Terminal 5, also offers some flights from this terminal. However it is not used by Iberia (Terminal 5 only), Malaysia Airlines, Royal Air Maroc and Qatar Airways (all Terminal 4 only). It is also used by Vueling, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of International Airlines Group, the parent of British Airways and Iberia, but is not itself a member of Oneworld. Vueling, British Airways, and Finnair are the only airlines offering short-haul flights from this terminal. =Non-aligned= The principal non-aligned airlines are Emirates and Virgin Atlantic; others include Beijing Capital Airlines, Iran Air, Pakistan International Airlines, and Philippine Airlines. Oman Air previously operated from this terminal until its move to Heathrow Terminal 4 in 2014. =SkyTeam= Two SkyTeam member airlines use Terminal 3: Delta Air Lines and Middle East Airlines. Delta moved all flights to Terminal 3 on 14 September 2016 to ease connections with partner Virgin Atlantic. Virgin Atlantic is not a SkyTeam member. =Star Alliance= Today, no Star Alliance airlines use Terminal 3.https://www.heathrow.com/airport-guide/which-terminal. Most Star Alliance airlines now use Terminal 2. In the past, a number of Star Alliance airlines used this terminal: Air Canada, Air China, All Nippon Airways, EgyptAir, Ethiopian Airlines, EVA Air, Scandinavian Airlines, Singapore Airlines, Thai Airways, and Turkish Airlines. Ground transportation =Inter-terminal transport= Terminal 3 is connected by an underground walkway to Terminal 2. Terminals 4 and 5 can be reached by the free Heathrow Express rail service. London Underground services can also be used to transfer to Terminals 4 and 5 (the former requiring a change of train at Hatton Cross) for free In addition, numerous buses ply between the Central Bus Station (for Terminals 2 and 3) and the other terminals. However, using the train service is much quicker and easier for passengers with luggage. The bus service is free between terminals. =Road links= As part of the three central terminals at Heathrow, it is well linked to the M4 motorway via the M4 spur road and through a tunnel under the north runway. =Rail links= Terminal 3 is accessed by the Piccadilly Line of the London Underground from Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3 tube station, with trains towards Cockfosters via Central London. The Terminal is also accessed by TfL Rail and Heathrow Express from Heathrow Central where services go to Paddington. TfL Rail services are due to be replaced by Crossrail when it finally opens at some point in the future and services would be increased from two trains per hour (about every 30 minutes) to four trains per hour (about every 15 minutes). =Bus links= Terminal 3 is accessible to both bus and coach services from Heathrow Central bus station. There are also several coach services operated by National Express operating to other London airports such as Gatwick, Stansted and Luton; and other cities in the United Kingdom.

When it was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in April 1969 it was the largest new airport terminal in western Europe. Prior to its closure on 29 June 2015 it had only been handling twenty daily flights by British Airways to nine destinations. In May 2017 the contents of the terminal were put up for auction. The footprint of Terminal 1 was planned to be used for construction of the second phase of Heathrow Terminal 2. History British European Airways aircraft at Terminal 1 in 1971 Lineup of British Airways aircraft at Terminal 1 in the early 1980s Terminal 1 was designed by Frederick Gibberd, who also designed the earlier Europa Building (renamed Terminal 2) and the adjacent Queens Building. It opened to passengers in 1968, and it was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II in April 1969. At the time, Terminal 1 was the biggest short-haul terminal of its kind in Western Europe.Above Us The Skies: The Story of BAA ‚Äì 1991 (Michael Donne ‚Äì BAA plc), p. 40 A new pier (the so-called Europier) was added in the 1990s which increased the capacity of the terminal, catering for wide- body aircraft. There was separation between arriving and departing passengers within the International section, although the terminal was not originally built to cater for this separation. In 2005, a substantial redesign and redevelopment of Terminal 1 was completed, which saw the opening of the new Eastern Extension, doubling the departure lounge in size and creating additional seating and retail space. Since the buyout of British Midland International (BMI), British Airways served some short- and medium-haul destinations from this terminal. Virgin Atlantic operated its short lived Little Red UK domestic operation from the former BMI departure area in Gate 8 of Terminal 1. Terminal 1 closed on 29 June 2015 to allow the second stage of Terminal 2's expansion. Ahead of its closure, all remaining flights were moved to other terminals. Several airlines had already left Terminal 1 ahead of this date during 2014 and 2015. The last tenants alongside British Airways were Icelandair, El Al and TAM Airlines; TAM Airlines moved to Terminal 3 on 27 May 2015. The final flight to depart Terminal 1 was British Airways BA0970 to Hannover, Germany, which departed at 21:30 on 29 June 2015. British Airways was the last airline to operate out of Terminal 1 with flights to Amman-Queen Alia, Baku, Beirut, Cairo and Hannover, which all moved to Terminal 5, and to Bilbao, Luxembourg, Lyon and Marseille, which have been relocated to Terminal 3. British Airways previously had a flight to Tel Aviv from this terminal; on 30 March 2014 the flight transferred to Terminal 5. As of 2019, the main terminal building still stands, empty but untouched, although some of the ancillary structures and contact piers have been demolished. Facilities Due to its impending closure, there were just seven shops left airside in the terminal by June 2015: Boots, Cocoon, Dixons Travel, Glorious Britain, WHSmith and World Duty Free. There was an airside link to Terminal 2 allowing passengers to use the facilities in that terminal. All Star Alliance members were formerly in Terminal 1 but moved to Terminal 2 due to its closure. The Star Alliance lounge, the El Al King David Lounge and the Servisair lounge were closed prior to the closure of the terminal. The British Airways International lounge near Gate 5 was operational until the end. The gates at Terminal 1 were numbered 2‚Äì8, 16‚Äì21 and 74‚Äì78. In early 2017 it was announced that the global auction firm CA Global Partners would host a series of auctions and private treaty sales involving all of the remaining contents of the terminal. Ground transport =Road links= As part of the three central terminals at Heathrow, it was well linked to the M4 motorway via the M4 spur road and through a tunnel under the north runway. There was a short stay car park directly opposite the terminal and there was also a long stay car park on the Northern Perimeter Road by the northern entrance to the tunnel accessed by a shuttle bus service. =Rail links= Terminal 1 was accessed by the London Underground from Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3 tube station, with trains towards Cockfosters via Central London. The terminal was also accessed by Heathrow Connect and Heathrow Express from Heathrow Terminals 2 & 3 where services go to London Paddington. =Bus links= Terminal 1 was accessible to both bus and coach services from Heathrow Central bus station. There were also several coach services operated by National Express.

Originally published in German in 1967, it‚Äôs a kaleidoscopic work, considered by critics his most disquieting and nihilistic. The German title, Verst√∂rung, translates as something like Confusion or Disturbance, but the American publisher chose Gargoyles, perhaps in order to render the array of human freaks the novel depicts to its very end. In fact, this is a singular, surreal study of the nature of humanity. Plot summary One morning a doctor takes his son‚Äîan idealistic student of science and rationality‚Äîon his daily rounds through the grim mountainous Austrian countryside. They observe the rural grotesques they encounter‚Äîfrom an innkeeper whose wife has been murdered to a crippled musical prodigy kept in a cage‚Äîcoping with physical misery, madness, and the brutality of the austere landscape. But when they meet the insomniac Prince Saurau in his castle at Hochgobernitz, his solitary, stationary mind takes over the rest of the novel in an uninterrupted obsessive paragraph. It's a hundred-page monologue by an eccentric, paranoid man, a relentlessly flowing cascade of words that is classic Bernhard: the furious logorrhea is a mesmeric rant, completing the stylistic formation of his art of exaggeration, where he uses metaphors of physical and mental illness to explore the decay of his homeland. Imagery, style and themes Gargoyles is a dark, broken work, the first of Bernhard's novels to be translated and the first to gain him national recognition. The writing style is haunting and compulsive, the setting is the fairy-tale landscape of rural Austria, especially the area surrounding a remote mountain gorge. Then there is the Hochgobernitz castle, which seems to be taken right out of a Nosferatu movie. Its owner - old prince Saurau - is the expression of the best (or worst) Bernhardian values: the Habsburg stand-in who steals the show with a hundred-page monologue about his own descent into madness and his fraught relationship with his own son. Bernhard shares with Kafka and Beckett the ability to extract more than utter gloom from his landscape of inconceivable devastation. While the external surface of life is unquestionably grim, he somehow suggests more ‚Äì the mystic element in experience that calls for symbolic interpretation; the inner significance of states that are akin to surrealistic dream-worlds; man‚Äôs yearning for health, compassion, sanity. Excerpts *Each patient doctor and son visit suffers from a different nightmarish ailment by which the father means to expose the boy to the ubiquity of sickness, brutality, and death. \\"It would be wrong to refuse to face the fact,\\" his father cautions him, \\"that everything is fundamentally sick and sad.\\" *[Prince Saurau on his decaying family] \\"My sisters but also my daughters always try to keep me going by fraudulent means, deceptions major and minor, but especially through one scandalous ruse: their attention.

The mail has got to come, I think. Mail! Mail! Mail! News!\\" *Communication, family, and death are Saurau‚Äôs main interests, bound up as they are with the fate of the old ancestral castle. He is the patriarch of a moribund clan whose life and history centre on Hochgobernitz . It, like Saurau and his family, is a pathetic relic of Old Austria. Saurau lives in fear of his expatriate son who will someday return from exile to liquidate the estate of the old prince is dead. But he says towards the end: \\"I often think that it is my duty to write to my son in London and tell him what is awaiting him here in Hochgobernitz some day, when I am dead: cold. Isolation. Madness. Deadly monologuing.\\" Saurau's chilling (and bitingly self-reflexive) list is the corrupt inheritance that awaits the sons of Austria's grand monarchical tradition. :;Book‚Äôs Epigraph :Le silence √©ternel de ces espaces infinis m'effraie. --Pascal, Pens√©e 206 References *The Nihilism of Thomas Bernhard, by Charles W.

A subwavelength- diameter optical fibre (SDF or SDOF) is an optical fibre whose diameter is less than the wavelength of the light being propagated through it. An SDF usually consists of long thick parts (same as conventional optical fibres) at both ends, transition regions (tapers) where the fibre diameter gradually decreases down to the subwavelength value, and a subwavelength-diameter waist, which is the main acting part. Due to such a strong geometrical confinement, the guided electromagnetic field in an SDF is restricted to a single mode called fundamental. Name There is no general agreement on how these optical elements are to be named; different groups prefer to emphasize different properties of such fibres, sometimes even using different terms. The names in use include subwavelength waveguide, subwavelength optical wire, subwavelength-diameter silica wire, subwavelength diameter fibre taper, (photonic) wire waveguide, photonic wire, photonic nanowire, optical nanowires, optical fibre nanowires, tapered (optical) fibre, fibre taper, submicron-diameter silica fibre, ultrathin optical fibres, optical nanofibre, optical microfibres, submicron fibre waveguides, micro/nano optical wires (MNOW). The term waveguide can be applied not only to fibres, but also to other waveguiding structures such as silicon photonic subwavelength waveguides. The term submicron is often synonymous to subwavelength, as the majority of experiments are carried out using light with a wavelength between 0.5 and 1.6 ¬µm. All the names with the prefix nano- are somewhat misleading, since it is usually applied to objects with dimensions on the scale of nanometers (e.g., nanoparticle, nanotechnology). The characteristic behaviour of the SDF appears when the fibre diameter is about half of the wavelength of light. That is why the term subwavelength is the most appropriate for these objects. Manufacturing An SDF is usually created by tapering a commercial, usually step-index, optical fibre. Special pulling machines accomplish the process. An optical fibre usually consists of a core, a cladding, and a protective coating. Before pulling a fibre, its coating is removed (i.e., the fibre is stripped). The ends of the bare fibre are fixed onto movable \\"translation\\" stages on the machine. The middle of the fibre (between the stages) is then heated with a flame (such as of burning oxyhydrogen) or a laser beam; at the same time, the translation stages move in opposite directions. The glass melts and the fibre is elongated, while its diameter decreases. Using the described method, waists between 1 and 10 mm in length and diameters down to 100 nm are obtained. In order to minimize the losses of light to unbound modes, one must control the pulling process so that the tapering angles satisfy the adiabatic condition by not exceeding a certain value, usually in the order of a few milliradian. For this purpose, a laser beam is coupled to the fibre been pulled and the output light is monitored by an optical power meter throughout the whole process. A good-quality SDF would transmit over 95% of the coupled light, most losses being due to scattering on the surface imperfections or impurities at the waist region. If the fibre being tapered is uniformly pulled over a stationary heating source, the resulting SDF has an exponential radius profile. In many cases it is convenient to have a cylindrical waist region, that is the waist of a constant thickness. Fabrication of such a fibre requires continuous adjustments of the hotzone by moving the heating source, and the fabrication process becomes significantly longer. Handling Being extremely thin, an SDF is also extremely fragile. Therefore, an SDF is usually mounted onto a special frame immediately after pulling and is never detached from this frame. The common way of securing a fibre to the mount is by a polymer glue such as an epoxy resin or an optical adhesive. Dust, however, may attach to the surface of an SDF. If significant laser power is coupled into the fibre, the dust particles will scatter light in the evanescent field, heat up, and may thermally destroy the waist. In order to prevent this, SDFs are pulled and used in dust-free environments such as flowboxes or vacuum chambers. For some applications, it is useful to immerse the freshly tapered SDF into purified water and thus prevent the waist from contamination. Applications Applications include sensors, nonlinear optics, fibre couplers, atom trapping and guiding, quantum interface for quantum information processing,See, for example, a theoretical analysis with applications to precise quantum nondemolition measurement all- optical switches, optical manipulation of dielectric particles.

Parker was the New South Wales Minister for the Environment and the Minister for Heritage in the O'Farrell government from 2011 until she was sacked from the ministry by new Premier Mike Baird in 2014. Early years and background Parker was born to parents, Adeline and Campbell McEwen. Her family has its origins in the dairy farming district of Taranaki, New Zealand. She studied at the Palmerston North Teacher's College at Massey University, New Zealand and obtained a Diploma of Teaching. She subsequently worked as a development officer with a focus on Children's Services for the City of Sunshine between 1979 and 1980; a Family Day Care Co-ordinator for the City of Oakleigh between 1981 and 1982, and for Queensland Centacare between 1982 and 1983. After moving to Maitland in the mid-1980s, she was the Co-ordinator of a mobile resource service between 1984 and 1995 and she also taught child studies for TAFE between 1985 and 1992. At Maitland she developed one of the first mobile community outreach programs for that city. Her interest in politics became evident in 1999, when she became a political advisor to Senator John Tierney but left in November 2001 to become a manager at a skin cancer centre in Lake Macquarie. At the clinic she developed and implemented a program to encourage women to take leadership positions within politics, particularly the Liberal party. Parker was the Vice-President of the Liberal Party of New South Wales in 1997‚Äì2000, and was the president of the NSW Women's Council in 2000‚Äì2003. As head of the Liberal Women's Forum, she supported the training and mentoring of women in all levels of Government and initiated the Pathways to Political Leadership Programme. Political career =Ministerial career= As Minister for the Environment, Parker has sought to increase penalties for pollution and develop an independent Environment Protection Authority. She pursued a science-based approach to recovery of threatened species and secured additional funding for these programs. During Parker's ministry, the EPA also introduced an energy and waste policy aimed at business recycling across NSW, and programs to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill. In three years as heritage minister Parker delivered a record number of Maitland buildings to the state heritage register including Maitland's Jewish Cemetery. During her time as Minister for the Environment, Parker also oversaw the creation of the most comprehensive air quality network in Australia Securing the International World Parks Congress for Sydney in November 2014, greater support for Taronga Zoo's conservation program, the introduction of legislation banning solaria, making NSW the second in the world to do so (a lead other states have followed) and provided increased funding for community, local government, not for profit and aboriginal heritage projects throughout New South Wales. Parker and the Environment Protection Authority received a lot of criticism following a hexavlent chromium emission at Orica's ammonium nitrate plant in Newcastle in August 2011;. Parker refused to apologise for why there was a delay in informing the public of the spill claiming she was left off of a crucial departmental email. The Sydney Morning Herald reported \\" It was also reported that there was a pattern going back more than a decade with 32 documented serious pollution incidents in New South Wales since 1999 in which companies failed to notify authorities within 24 hours. Ms Parker has been criticised for not notifying the public about the incident until Thursday afternoon, three days later, despite being informed on Wednesday evening.\\" The Parliamentary report showed that Parker was notified about the incident by the Office of Environment and Heritage on 10 August 2011 at 4.23pm. In the morning of 11 August 2011, the Premier's Chief of Staff was notified by Parker's office and Parker informed the parliament at 3:30pm. It was reported that Parker received media training from journalist John Mangos to handle the crisis. The head of Orica claimed he tried to contact Parker about the spill three times with no success. Parker responded \\"The time for Orica to contact the Government and environmental authorities was as soon as the Kooragang Island leak occurred ‚Äì not seven days later\\". In November 2011, NSW Opposition Leader John Robertson called on the Premier to sack Parker saying \\"the job of a minister is to take responsibility for protecting the community and from day one, Ms Parker has clearly failed to live up to that standard\\". An upper house inquiry into the Orica incident was released in February 2012, the inquiry's report stated \\"The delay by the Minister for the Environment in informing the public regarding the leak, whether by press statement, ministerial statement or other means, was unacceptable\\" The inquiry also stated \\"in this instance Minister Parker's actions led to a great deal of political debate ultimately increasing public concern and confusion about the leak.\\" Immediately after the Orica incident the Government held an independent inquiry with an independent chairperson. Brendan O'Reilly, the former director general of the NSW Premier's department. Mr O'Reilly's report stated that \\"The public were exposed to the media reporting of the political debate with claims and counter claims being made. This resulted in increased concerns and confusion in the minds of the public.\\" On 11 October 2011, Parker introduced the Protection of the Environment Legislation Amendment Bill into the Parliament aimed at strengthening the ability of the Environment Protection Authority to regulate serious pollution incidents by significantly improving notification requirements and pollution incident response management provisions and increase penalties for non-compliance. The Bill was passed on 13 October 2011. In a budget estimates hearing in 2011, Parker stated \\"logging protects koalas.\\" Opposition environment spokesperson Luke Foley said that Parker had broken her government's promise of protecting koalas. Foley also said \\"Robyn Parker is allowing a national icon to be endangered thanks to her 'unsound ecological approach' \\" In one of her last acts as Minister for Environment, Parker launched a master plan for Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. The plan was seen as controversial and criticised by the opposition and former Australian of the Year Ian Kiernan as commercialisation of the gardens. Former Prime Minister Paul Keating also criticised the plan saying \\"\\"While the government is spending a lot of money on a cultured headland park at Barangaroo to the west, the same government, with the authority of environment minister Robyn Parker, is spending money to destroy the gardens to the east\\". In a cabinet reshuffle in 2014, new Premier Mike Baird sacked Parker and replaced with Rob Stokes as the new Minister for the Environment. Despite being endorsed as the candidate for the seat of Maitland, Parker announced her retirement from Parliament and did not contest the election held in March 2015. =Legislative Council= Parker was first touted as a Liberal candidate in 2000 However, she had to wait until 2002 to be pre-selected for the fifth position on the Liberal ticket, and was the seventh person elected on the combined Liberal/National ticket. In 2004 she spoke on the debate of the Criminal Procedure Amendment Sexual Offences Bill in the New South Wales Parliament. She supported the introduction of closed circuit television for victims to give their evidence in court as she had been a victim when she was nineteen in New Zealand. In the debate she pointed out the different standards that apply to rape victims compared to other victims of crime. She said that if \\"an assailant held you at knifepoint, asked you for your wallet and you complied, there is no question that a crime was committed. You would not be asked if you consented. You would not be asked if you had tried to resist. Only survivors of sexual assault are asked these questions.\\" =Legislative Assembly= On 19 February 2010, Parker was pre-selected by the Liberal Party to contest the semi-marginal Lower House seat of Maitland. At the 2011 election, Parker was elected with a swing of 20.3 per cent and won the seat with 56.3 per cent of the two-party vote. Her main competitor was the incumbent sitting member, Labor's Frank Terenzini. Personal life Parker is married to David and has three children Dylan, Chelsea and Heath and two stepchildren Ben and Tim. Her husband stood for the seat of Newcastle in the 2003 election. Parker told parliament in 2004 that she had been raped as a teenager and nailed her bedroom windows shut in the aftermath. In 2009 it was revealed that her eldest son, Dylan, then aged 22, made and flew paper planes and had become one of the world's best, while simultaneously dealing with the sudden discovery of a brain tumour. His story was broadcast in an episode of the ABC TV program Australian Story.

Occupational therapy education in the UK Every year around 1,500 new students embark on training to become registered occupational therapists. To qualify as an occupational therapist one is required undertake an approved programme of study at one of the 31 UK universities offering occupational therapy education. There are a variety of full and part-time programmes available in occupational therapy the UK, most are Bachelor of Science (with Honours) degrees; some are Postgraduate Diplomas, others are Master's degrees. All programmes must be approved by the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC) as meeting their minimum standards. This approval is mandatory in order for the graduates to be registered to practice. In contrast, accreditation is a voluntary process which confers further recognition of a programme by the Royal College of Occupational Therapists (RCOT). Those universities that continue to be accredited have committed to working in partnership with the professional body (the RCOT) to maintain high standards of education and practice, and to steer the profession‚Äôs development within the UK and abroad. The content of programmes varies but all combine both practice and academic study. Academic components may include anatomy and physiology, psychology and sociology, occupational therapy knowledge and skills, creative and management skills, therapeutic interventions, environmental adaptations and research methods and applications. History of occupational therapy in the UK In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the establishment of public health measures to control infectious diseases included the building of fever hospitals. Patients with tuberculosis were recommended to have a regime of prolonged bed rest followed by a gradual increase in exercise.Patterson 1997, cited in Turner et al., 2003 Dr Philip, a Scottish physician, prescribed graded activity from complete rest through to gentle exercise and eventually to activities such as digging, sawing, carpentry and window cleaning. During this period a farm colony near Edinburgh and a village settlement near Papworth in Cambridgeshire were established, both of which aimed to employ people in appropriate long-term work prior to their return to open employment. During and after the First World War, casualties amongst young men resulted in an acute shortage of manpower in the workforce. The need to re-establish these men in open employment facilitated the growth of OT in the treatment of those with physical disabilities. Curative workshops were opened within military hospitals, based on similar workshops already established in the United States, and were equipped with tools and machinery to exercise joints and muscles. Based on these workshops the first occupational therapy department in Scotland was opened in 1936 at the Astley Ainslie Institution in Edinburgh, where at the same time the first Occupational Therapy Training Centre was opened. Margaret Barr Fulton became the first occupational therapist to work in the United Kingdom in 1925. She qualified at the Philadelphia School in the United States and was appointed to the Aberdeen Royal Hospital for mental patients where she worked until her retirement in 1963. During that time, she gained an international reputation for her department and for her part in the development of both the Scottish Association (SAOT) and the World Federation of Occupational Therapists (WFOT). OT was introduced into England by Dr Elizabeth Casson who had visited similar establishments in America. In 1929 she established her own residential clinic in Bristol, Dorset House, for ‚Äòwomen with mental disorders‚Äô, and worked as its medical director. It was here in 1930 that she founded the first school of occupational therapy in the UK, Dorset House, The Promenade, Clifton. Its first Principal was Constance Tebbit (later Owens) who returned from training as an occupational therapist in Philadelphia to take up her post. She later went on to set up the Liverpool School of Occupational Therapy. She opened Dorset House School of Occupational Therapy in Bristol in 1930. Her interest in occupational therapy continued with involvement in the Association of Occupational Therapists (AOT), established in 1936. The Second World War added impetus to the development of occupational therapy as the profession played a vital role in the rehabilitation and re-establishment of wounded soldiers into the workforce.  Why are occupational therapists interested in occupation?  Occupational therapists work from an understanding that there is a relationship between the things that people do and their health and well-being This is a list of some of the characteristics of occupations, as discussed in literature in the last decade: * Occupations are activities both meaningful and purposeful to the individual performing them * They also usually have sociocultural meaning * Occupations fill and structure time * They tend to be grouped according to purpose: self-care, leisure and productivity (or work) * They support roles and participation in society * Occupations contribute to the individual‚Äôs sense of identity * Activities are not occupations if they are involuntary, or if they are aimed at a goal which does not involve individual meaning and participation It has been suggested that occupation can be defined simply as ‚Äòdoing, being and becoming‚Äô, a simple definition which captures the notion of subjectively meaningful activity which results in some kind of transformation in the ‚Äòdoer‚Äô. The word ‚Äòoccupation‚Äô has a relatively precise usage in the fields of occupational therapy and occupational science but other disciplines (such as anthropology, psychology, leisure studies) have an interest in the human activities. It can be argued that all activities are meaningful, given that they are socially situated, symbolic constructs, and so the understanding of an activity as an occupation rests, perhaps on personal meaningfulness.

Every city-state of Greece had a politeia at all times of its sovereign life, including the preceding Achaean Sparta and the subsequent Roman Sparta. The politeia of Dorian Sparta, however, was noted by many classical authors for its unique features, which supported a rigidly layered social system and a strong military. The act of foundation =Great Rhetra= According to Plutarch, Lycurgus (to whom is attributed the establishment of the severe reforms for which Sparta has become renowned, sometime in the 9th century BC) first sought counsel from the god Apollo by obtaining an oracle from Delphi regarding the formation of his government. The divine proclamation, which he received in this manner, is known as a \\"rhetra\\" and is given in part by Plutarch as follows: ::When thou hast built a temple to Zeus Syllabus and Athena Syllania, divided the people into 'phylai' and into 'obai', and established a senate of thirty members, including the 'archagetai', then from time to time 'appellazein' between Babyca and Cnacion, and there introduce and rescind measures; but the people must have the deciding voice and the power. Plutarch provides by way of explanation: \\"In these clauses, the \\"phylai\\" and the \\"obai\\" refer to divisions and distributions of the people into clans and phratries, or brotherhoods; by \\"archagetai\\" the kings are designated, and \\"appellazein\\" means to assemble the people, with a reference to Apollo, the Pythian god, who was the source and author of the polity. The Babyca is now called Cheimarrus, and the Cnacion Oenus; but Aristotle says that Cnacion is a river, and Babyca a bridge.\\" Another version of the rhetra is given by H. Michell: ::After having built a temple to Zeus Syllanius and Athene Syllania, and having 'phyled the phyles' (œÜœÖŒªŒ¨œÇ œÜœÖŒªŒ¨ŒæŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ±) and 'obed the obes' (œéŒ≤Œ¨œÇ œéŒ≤Œ¨ŒæŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ±) you shall establish a council of thirty elders, the leaders included. That is to say that after the people had been divided according to their different tribes (\\"phyles\\" and \\"obes\\"), they would welcome the new Lycurgan reforms. =Laws of Lycurgus= The Spartans had no historical records, literature, or written laws, which were, according to tradition, expressly prohibited by an ordinance of Lycurgus, excluding the Great Rhetra. Issuance of coinage was forbidden. Spartans were obliged to use iron obols (bars or spits), meant to encourage self-sufficiency and discourage avarice and the hoarding of wealth. A Spartan citizen in good standing was one who maintained his fighting skills, showed bravery in battle, ensured that his farms were productive, was married and had healthy children. Spartan women were the only Greek women to hold property rights on their own, and were required to practice sports before marriage. Although they had no formal political rights, they were expected to speak their minds boldly and their opinions were heard. Structure of Spartan society and government Spartan society can be represented by a three-layer pyramid ruled by the government. The structure of Spartan society, c. early 7th century BC =Society= Spartiates Not all inhabitants of the Spartan state were considered citizens (part of the demos). Only those who had successfully undertaken military training, called the agoge, were eligible. Usually, the only people eligible to receive the agoge were Spartiates‚Äîmen who could trace their ancestry to the original inhabitants of the city‚Äîalthough there were two exceptions. Trophimoi (\\"foster sons\\") were foreign teenagers invited to study. This was meant as a supreme honor. The pro-Spartan Athenian magnate Xenophon sent his two sons to Sparta for their education as trophimoi. Alcibiades, being an Alcmaeonid and thus a member of a family with old and strong connections to Sparta, was admitted as a trophimos and famously excelled in the agoge as well as otherwise (he was rumoured to have seduced one of the two queen consorts with his exceptional looks). The other exception was that sons of helots could be enrolled as syntrophoi (comrades, literally \\"the ones fed, or reared, together\\") if a Spartiate formally adopted him and paid his way. If a syntrophos did exceptionally well in training, he might be sponsored to become a Spartiate himself. A free-born Spartan who had successfully completed the agoge became a \\"peer\\" (·ΩÖŒºŒøŒπŒøœÇ, h√≥moios, literally \\"similar\\") with full civil rights at the age of 20, and remained one as long as he could contribute his equal share of grain to the common military mess in which he was obliged to dine every evening for as long as he was battle-worthy (usually until the age of 60). This was meant as assurance that every peer took good care of his estates and patrimony. Such h√≥moioi were also required to sleep in the barracks until the age of 30, regardless of whether they were married or not. Perioeci Others in the state were the Perioeci or Per√≠oikoi, a social class and population group of non-citizen inhabitants. The Perioeci were free, unlike the helots, but were not full Spartan citizens. They had a central role in the Spartan economy, controlling commerce and business, as well as being responsible for crafts and manufacturing. Helots Helots were the state-owned serfs who made up 90 percent of the population. They were citizens of conquered states, such as Messenia who were conquered for their fertile land during the First Messenian War. =Government= The Doric state of Sparta, copying the Doric Cretans, instituted a mixed governmental state: it was composed of elements of monarchical, oligarchical, and democratic systems. Isocrates refers to the Spartans as \\"subject to an oligarchy at home, to a kingship on campaign\\" (iii. 24). Dual Kingship The state was ruled by two hereditary kings of the Agiad and the Eurypontid families, both descendants of Heracles and equal in authority so that one could not act against the power and political enactments of his colleague, though the Agiad king received greater honour by virtue of seniority of his family for being the \\"oldest extant\\" (Herod. vi. 5). There are several legendary explanations for this unusual dual kingship, which differ only slightly; for example, that King Aristodemus had twin sons, who agreed to share the kingship, and this became perpetual. Modern scholars have advanced various theories to account for the anomaly. Some theorize that this system was created in order to prevent absolutism, and is paralleled by the analogous instance of the dual consuls of Rome. Others believe that it points to a compromise arrived at to end the struggle between two families or communities. Other theories suggest that this was an arrangement that was met when a community of villages combined to form the city of Sparta. Subsequently the two chiefs from the largest villages became kings. Another theory suggests that the two royal houses represent respectively the Spartan conquerors and their Achaean predecessors: those who hold this last view appeal to the words attributed by Herodotus (v. 72) to Cleomenes I: \\"I am no Dorian, but an Achaean\\"; although this is usually explained by the (equally legendary) descent of Aristodemus from Heracles. Either way, kingship in Sparta was hereditary and thus every king Sparta had was a descendant of the Agiad and the Eurypontid families. Accession was given to the male child who was first born after a king's accession. The duties of the kings were primarily religious, judicial, and militaristic. They were the chief priests of the state, and performed certain sacrifices and also maintained communication with the Delphic sanctuary, which always exercised great authority in Spartan politics. In the time of Herodotus (about 450 BC), their judicial functions had been restricted to cases dealing with heiresses, adoptions and the public roads. Civil cases were decided by the ephors, and criminal jurisdiction had been passed to the ephors, as well as to a council of elders. By 500 BC the Spartans had become increasingly involved in the political affairs of the surrounding city-states, often putting their weight behind pro-Spartan candidates. Shortly before 500 BC, as described by Herodotus, such an action fueled a confrontation between Sparta and Athens, when the two kings, Demaratus and Cleomenes, took their troops to Athens. However, just before the heat of battle, King Demaratus changed his mind about attacking the Athenians and abandoned his co-king. For this reason, Demaratus was banished, and eventually found himself at the side of Persian King Xerxes for his invasion of Greece twenty years later (480 BC), after which the Spartans enacted a law demanding that one king remain behind in Sparta while the other commanded the troops in battle. Aristotle describes the kingship at Sparta as \\"a kind of unlimited and perpetual generalship\\" (Pol. iii. I285a), Here also, however, the royal prerogatives were curtailed over time. Dating from the period of the Persian wars, the king lost the right to declare war, and was accompanied in the field by two ephors. He was supplanted also by the ephors in the control of foreign policy. Over time, the kings became mere figureheads except in their capacity as generals. Real power was transferred to the ephors and to the gerousia. Ephors The ephors, chosen by popular election from the whole body of citizens, represented a democratic element in the constitution. After the ephors were introduced, they, together with the two kings, were the executive branch of the state.ephor - Britannica Online Encyclopedia Ephors themselves had more power than anyone in Sparta, although the fact that they only stayed in power for a single year reduced their ability to conflict with already established powers in the state. Since reelection was not possible, an ephor who abused his power, or confronted an established power center, would have to suffer retaliation. Although the five ephors were the only officials with regular legitimization by popular vote, in practice they were often the most conservative force in Spartan politics. Gerousia Sparta had a special policy maker, the gerousia, a council consisting of 28 elders over the age of 60, elected for life and usually part of the royal households, and the two kings. High state policy decisions were discussed by this council who could then propose action alternatives to the demos. Apella The collective body of Spartan citizenry would select one of the alternatives by voting. Unlike most Greek poleis, the Spartan citizen assembly could neither set the agenda of issues to be decided, nor debate them, merely vote on the alternatives presented to them. Neither could foreign embassies or emissaries address the assembly; they had to present their case to the Gerousia, which would then consult with the Ephors. Sparta considered all discourse from outside as a potential threat and all other states as past, present, or future enemies, to be treated with caution in the very least, even when bound with alliance treaties.

Mayadunne was a fierce opponent of the Portuguese, who had arrived on the Island in 1505. He devoted his whole life attempting to oust his brother Bhuvanekabahu, the king of Kotte and thereby preserve the independence of Lanka, which was being undermined by the Portuguese intrigue. He constantly invaded the territory of Bhuvanekabahu of Kotte. Early life Mayadunne was born in 1501 in Kotte of the Kingdom of Kotte. He was the son of Vijayabahu VII who reigned as king from 1509 to 1521. Mayadunne was the youngest child born to Vijaya Bahu VII and his main Queen. He had two full brothers, Bhuvanekabahu and Raigama Bandara. Bhuvanekabahu who was also king of Kotte from 1521 to 1551. =Wijayaba Kollaya= In 1521 together with his two full brothers Bhuvanekabahu and Raigama Bandara, who were born to the main queen of Vijaya Bahu VII, he revolted against his father, suspecting him of planning to pass the throne of Kotte to one of Vijaya Bahu VII's other queen's sons (Devaraja) after his death. Although Mayadunne was the youngest of the three brothers he was the mastermind behind this revolt which ended with the death of their father Vijaya Bahu VII (he was assassinated by a hired foreigner) and the Kotte Kingdom was divided between the three brothers. This incident is known as \\"Wijayaba Kollaya\\" and can roughly be translated as the \\"Spoiling of Vijayabahu\\". Bhuvanekabahu came to power as Bhuvanekabahu VII of Sri Lanka and he got established in the Kotte Kingdom with a region roughly including present day Colombo, Gampaha, Districts, North Western Province and Southern Province coastline. Raigama Bandara got established in Raigama with his control roughly over present day Kalutara District & Southern Province except the coastline (which was under Kotte Kingdom). Mayadunne got established in the Kingdom of Sitawaka (Present day Avissawella) controlling roughly the modern day Sabaragamuwa Province (Kegalle, Ratnapura Districts). Reign Since Mayadunne was the main actor during the rebellion against their father, Bhuvanekabahu VII was from the beginning suspicious of him and developed close ties with the Portuguese who had established a fort in Colombo (1517). Before long Mayadunne got popular support from the local chiefs and population who didn't like Bhuvanekabahu VII collaborating with Portuguese. Mayadunne led several invasions against Kotte but Bhuvanekabahu VII was able to drive Sitawakan forces back with the help of Portuguese. During the first phase of these battles Mayadunne was helped by an anti-Portuguese Kingdom in Calicut, India. The Portuguese wanted to kill Mayadunne fearing one day he would become a greater threat to their foothold on the Island but Bhuvanekabahu VII didn't let them to conduct an all out invasion against Sitawaka. Several years later after Raigam Bandara died, in 1538, Mayadunne annexed the Kingdom of Raigama to Sitawaka. The all out rivalry between Sitawaka and Kotte started to unroll here on. By this time the Buddhist monks in Kotte who were responsible of the Dantha Dhathuwa, the Sacred Tooth Relic of Buddha, secretly smuggled it into Sitawaka and placed it under the protection of Mayadunne since they saw Portuguese as hostile towards Buddhism. According to the local tradition if someone has the ownership of the Tooth Relic he can claim the throne of all the Kingdoms within Sri Lanka. Mayadunne's popularity grew rapidly among locals and similarly Bhuvanekabahu VII of Kotte and later Dharmapala of Kotte had to rely more and more on Portuguese for help. Mayadunne started frequent attacks against the Kotte Kingdom and more and more of the lands of Kotte became part of Sitawaka. Since Kotte lacked local support the Portuguese automatically became the protectors of that Kingdom. Hence the rivalry between Kotte and Sitawaka turned into a rivalry between Sitawaka and Portuguese. During the period of Kingdom of Sitawaka King Mayadunne had stopped at the Nawagamuwa Pattini Devalaya to make a vow before he went to war with the Portuguese in the Colombo Fort. According to the reports of the Portuguese, in 1550, the King of Portuguese sent 600 troops to help King Bhuvanaikabahu VII of Kotte. They fought with King Mayadunne at Nawagamuwa. It is also recorded that in 1576, the Portuguese army destroyed Nawagamuwa Devale and established an army camp there.http://amazinglanka.com/wp/nawagamuwa/ =Sinhalese‚ÄìPortuguese War= Mayadunne and the Kingdom of Sitawaka was a part of the Sinhalese‚ÄìPortuguese War, which was an effort to get rid of the occupying Portuguese forces and stop them from colonizing the island. At the time, it was the worst ever defeat by a colonial power on eastern soil. Mayadunne and his son Rajasigha fought the Portuguese in the Battle of Mulleriyawa and won, where the Kingdom of Sitawaka emerged all-powerful, able to challenge the Portuguese, who lost the opportunity to ensure their total control of the island. Death and legacy Due to the fact that he stood against Portuguese invaders and stopping them from conquering the whole island, Mayadunne is considered one of the greatest kings of Sri Lanka. He died at the ripe age of 80 years in 1581.

A narrow region of a crystal is melted with a powerful CO2 or YAG laser. The laser and hence the floating zone, is moved along the crystal. The molten region melts impure solid at its forward edge and leaves a wake of purer material solidified behind it. This technique for growing crystals from the melt (liquid/solid phase transition) is used in materials research. Advantages The main advantages of this technique are the high pulling rates (60 times greater than the conventional Czochralski technique) and the possibility of growing materials with very high melting points. In addition, LHPG is a crucible-free technique, which allows single crystals to be grown with high purity and low stress. The geometric shape of the crystals (the technique can produce small diameters), and the low production cost, make the single-crystal fibers (SCF) produced by LHPG suitable substitutes for bulk crystals in many devices, especially those that use high melting point materials. However, single-crystal fibers must have equal or superior optical and structural qualities compared to bulk crystals to substitute for them in technological devices. This can be achieved by carefully controlling the growth conditions. Optical elements Schematic of a LFZ system Until 1980, laser-heated crystal growth used only two laser beams focused over the source material. This condition generated a high radial thermal gradient in the molten zone, making the process unstable. Increasing the number of beams to four did not solve the problem, although it improved the growth process. An improvement to the laser-heated crystal growth technique was made by Fejer et al., who incorporated a special optical component known as a reflaxicon, consisting of an inner cone surrounded by a larger coaxial cone section, both with reflecting surfaces. This optical element converts the cylindrical laser beam into a larger diameter hollow cylinder surface. This optical component allows radial distribution of the laser energy over the molten zone, reducing radial thermal gradients. The axial temperature gradient in this technique can go as high as 10000 ¬∞C/cm, which is very high when compared to traditional crystal growth techniques (10‚Äì100 ¬∞C/cm). Convection speed A feature of the LHPG technique is its high convection speed in the liquid phase due to Marangoni convection. The video presented in the following reference shows the liquid phase convection during lithium niobate (LiNbO3) fiber pulling using a very small piece of platinum wire inside the liquid that is allowed to spin. It is possible to see that it spins very fast. Even when it appears to be standing still, it is in fact spinning fast on its axis.

Life and works  RNLB Mary Stanford was chosen as the image to be represented on that postage stamp Gribble was born in Chelsea in 1872. His father Herbert A. K. Gribble ARIBA was an architect known for his design of the Brompton Oratory. Gribble was set to follow in his father's footsteps but instead elected to become a full-time painter in oils and watercolours. He was educated at the College of St Francis Saviour, Bruges, Belgium; South Kensington Art School; and under Albert Toft. He married Eleanor Mabel Clunn (nicknamed \\"Nellie\\"). They settled in Poole, Dorset, sometime between 1915 and 1924 (or perhaps in the 1930s), living at 3 Springfield Crescent, Parkstone. He became a member ‚Äî along with Henry Lamb and Augustus John ‚Äî of the Poole and East Dorset Art Society. Although his work included landscapes of Poole and portraits, Gribble was best known as a painter of historical (and often romanticised) maritime scenes. It was once suggested that he had painted \\"almost every historic event that took place on water, from the landing of William the Conqueror to the Scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow in 1919\\". Spanish galleons and treasure vessels are well represented in his work, and one critic described him as a \\"specialist in burning ships\\". Others compared his paintings to the fine marine vistas of the late 19th-century seascape artist, Henry Moore, acknowledging Gribble's skill in the accurate portrayal of costume and technical detail and his ability to convey an authentic period atmosphere.(1) In his preparatory sketches of ships, Gribble made notes on the precise structure and names of sails, masts, and rigging. He had studied the movement of water closely, and made highly technical analyses of the construction of rigging and sails to a level where it naturally informed his naval subjects. He also paid close attention to the detail of costume. The evident quality of Gribble's marine pictures lies in the artist's mastery of the oil painting medium adapted to a profound understanding of his chosen subject.(2) Gribble exhibited regularly at the Royal Academy and the Paris Salon, and his paintings were widely sought after. Franklin D. Roosevelt was one of many celebrity owners of Gribble paintings. He purchased a painting showing the arrival of American destroyers at Queenstown in Ireland, during World War I. It hung in the Oval Office of the White House when Roosevelt became United States President in 1933. The President reputedly suggested the painting's name ‚ÄîThe Return of the Mayflower ‚Äî to the artist. Roosevelt also purchased Surrender of the German Fleet to the Grand Fleet at Scapa Flow. Gribble had been one of the few civilian witnesses to this event in 1918; in his capacity as Official Maritime Painter to the Shipwrights' Company. Both works are believed to have been painted in 1919.(3) Other notable purchasers of Gribble paintings included Queen Mary, the German Kaiser, and Jackie Onassis. The Kaiser was so impressed by Gribble's work that King George V summoned the artist to a royal residence to meet him. Gribble was in demand as an illustrator, and his work appeared in many leading magazines, including '\\"The Illustrated London News and '\\"The Graphic. He illustrated numerous books, his work appearing even on royal postcards and chocolate boxes. After his death in 1962, his widow donated many of his works to Poole Museum, which now possesses the world's largest collection of Gribbles. The collection numbers 250 paintings, drawings, prints and photographs. Typical paintings in the Poole collection are The Plague Ship, The Whelp of the Black Rover and The Return of the Argosy Galleons, but there are also some local topographical works such as depictions of the Guildhall, the Custom House, views of the Quay and harbour, a portrait of former Mayor of Poole, Herbert Carter, in civic regalia, and one of a woman believed to be Gribble's wife Nellie. Although Gribble's work has been out of fashion for some decades, Poole Museum has taken the opportunity provided by the First World War Centenary to reassess Gribble's art by staging an exhibition of his marine paintings, based on its collection and focusing on his war paintings. Part of the national centenary programme led by Imperial War Museums, the exhibition also includes loans from private and public collections, including the National Maritime Museum, and the highlight of these is a painting of the scuttling of the German Fleet at Scapa Flow, of which Gribble was an eye witness, from the Harris Museum and Art Gallery, Preston. The exhibition, titled Painting Drama at Sea, continued until February 2014. Personal life and burial Gribble is buried with his wife in Parkstone Cemetery, Poole, Dorset. They had no children.

It is a worldwide pest of stored products, particularly food grains, and a model organism for ethological and food safety research. Ecology The red flour beetle attacks stored grain and other food products including flour, cereals, pasta, biscuits, beans, and nuts, causing loss and damage. The United Nations, in a recent post-harvest compendium, estimated that Tribolium castaneum and Tribolium confusum, the confused flour beetle, are \\"the two most common secondary pests of all plant commodities in store throughout the world.\\" Distribution and habitat The red flour beetle is of Indo-Australian origin and less able to survive outdoors than the closely related species Tribolium confusum. It has, as a consequence, a more southern distribution, though both species are worldwide in heated environments. The adult is long-lived, sometimes living more than three years. Although previously regarded as a relatively sedentary insect, it has been shown in molecular and ecological research to disperse considerable distances by flight. Adult Polyandry Female red flour beetles are polyandrous in mating behavior. Within a single copulation period, a single female will mate with multiple different males. Female red flour beetles engage in polyandrous mating behavior in order to increase their fertility assurance. By mating with an increased number of males, female beetles obtain a greater amount of sperm. Obtaining a greater amount of sperm is especially important since many sexually active male red flour beetles are non-virgins and may be sperm-depleted. The species engages in polyandry to obtain a greater amount of sperm from males, not to increase the likelihood of finding genetically compatible sperm. = Potential fitness benefits of polyandry = Multiple mating events can ensure that females obtain a greater net amount of sperm, resulting in an increased likelihood of successful fertilization. In nature, repeated matings could result in males that have a low sperm count. Due to the males' low sperm count, a female may need to mate with several males before being successfully inseminated. Although multiple mating events may result in an increased likelihood for finding genetically compatible sperm, genetic compatibility cannot always be considered a major fitness advantage for polyandrous behavior. The increased viability of embryos‚Äîdue to increased genetic compatibility‚Äîdid not significantly increase the number of adult beetles over time, and therefore, did not play a significant role in the fitness of the overall population. However, increased genetic compatibility could increase the genetic diversity of the population, which maybe useful in various different environments. High genetic diversity within a population can lead to high phenotypic variation, which can subsequently enable some variants to better survive and reproduce given a sudden environmental change. = Potential fitness detriments of polyandry =  Male competition for access to females  The availability of resources and population size can greatly affect how many matings each individual participates in. Increased population size within a given area with fixed resources can limit how many offspring can survive. Therefore, males must often compete with other males to be the last male that mates with the female, to increase his fertilization rate. By being the last male to mate with a female, it is likely that his ejaculate removed previous ejaculate from previous males, increasing the chances that his sperm fertilizes the female. In fact, in areas with limited resources, higher rates of cannibalism among competitor males can result in an overall decrease in fitness of the population since there is a net decrease in offspring production and survival.  Reduced offspring fitness  Polyandrous behavior may not always result in the propagation of adaptive genes. In the red flour beetles, the ability of a male to attract females‚Äîthrough pheromones‚Äîis genetically based. Males vary in the ability to attract females. However, offspring fitness is not related to the ability of the males to attract females. In other words, just because a male reproduced more often due to increased ability to attract females, does not necessarily mean the offspring have inherited the traits that result in increased fitness. = Variation in polyandrous behavior and mate choice = Females of different geographic regions‚Äîand subsequently, different genetic backgrounds‚Äîoften show great variation in mating behavior. Certain strains of females avoid multiple mating events while other strains of female engage in higher degrees of polyandry. This variation suggests that polyandry can be advantageous in some populations but not in others. Female beetles vary in which males they choose to copulate with. Moreover, female beetles can specifically choose which male's sperm is utilized for fertilization through cryptic choice. Females that have multiple sperm receptacles can store sperm from different males and can later choose which sperm is used for fertilization. Male beetles can also vary in the females they choose to mate with. Males are extremely selective in their mate choice. They prefer to mate with mature, virgin females. If a male mates with a virgin female, his sperm has an extremely high chance to fertilize the female if another male does not mate with her. Males are able to differentiate between virgin females and non-virgin females through scent; the wax-like secretions of competitor males could be found on the reproductive glands of non-virgin females, but not on virgin females. Males that possess an increase in the number of odor receptors are better able to choose which females to reproduce with and subsequently, increase their fitness. Some males possess better suited characteristics to detect the maturity and reproductive status of the female, and as such, will preferentially breed with only those females that will have the highest production of offspring. Likewise, males that deposit stronger scents will have an indirect fitness advantage due to their odor deterring other potential mates from an already inseminated female.  Polygamy  Polygamy in red flour beetles is a behavior common to both males and females of this species. Polyandry is thus polygamy in the female members of a population as discussed in the section above. On the other hand, polygyny refers to polygamy practiced by males in a population. = Polygamy in populations that lack genetic diversity = In red flour beetles, females that engage in polygamous behavior produce more offspring than those that are less polygamous. Polygamy is mostly seen in populations that lack genetic diversity. Polygamy in less genetically diverse populations is a means of avoiding fertilization between beetles that are closely related since they may be genetically incompatible.Welsh Jennifer. (2011).\\"Inbreeding makes female beetles frisky.\\" Live Science. The more partners that a male or female has, the higher the chances that at least one of the matings is with an unrelated partner and the greater the genetic diversity in the offspring. In this way, genetic incompatibility is reduced and diversity is increased in a population. For this reason, females copulate with more males when genetic diversity is low in order to attain fertilization success and also increase fitness in their subsequent offspring. In some studies, however, it has been noted that fertilization can still occur when related beetles mate. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that there is a significantly lower number of offspring produced when inbred beetles mate than when the matings are between out-bred partners. Successful fertilization observed in a small portion of research in related beetles has led some biologists to claim that there may be no inbreeding depression in red flour beetles. Even though there is successful fertilization, it is observed that a lower number of total offspring is produced, which can be argued to be a type of inbreeding depression since it lowers reproduction fitness. During mating, red flour beetles are known to engage in polygamous behavior. Male flour beetles have been known to recognize their relatives while the females do not have this capability. Lack of the ability to recognize their relatives has led females to mate with any male within the population. Female red flour beetles are also known to store sperm after mating. More sperm is stored by the first mating, which leads to less sperm stored in subsequent matings. However, amount of stored sperm does not stop the last male mate from fertilizing the egg. This is due to the fact that with each mating, males can remove previously stored sperm thus giving their own sperm an advantage to fertilize the egg.  Polygyny and fertilization success  In red flour beetles, males are known to engage in polygamous behavior. Research largely shows that Male red flour beetles engage in polygamous behavior to avoid inbreeding depression, especially when there is competition from other males. There is a higher fertilization success in out- bred males when they compete with inbred males to fertilize the same female. In polygamous beetles, the male that last fertilizes the female ends up having a higher fertilization success. Polygamy can thus be seen as an evolutionary result as males compete to be the last to fertilize the female's egg and contribute more to the next generation. Sperm precedence is thus a means of evolutionary competition through which the males try to achieve greater reproductive success.  As a model organism  The Red Flour beetle has played an important role as a model organism serving as a model for development and functional genomics. Compared to Drosophila, the Red Flour beetle more closely represents the development of other insects.Richards, S. Gibbs, R. Weinstock, G. 2008. The genome of the model beetle and pest Tribolium castaneum. Nature. 452: 949-955. In 2008, the genome of Tribolium castaneum was sequenced, analyzed, and compared to other organisms such as Drosophila. The Red flour beetle and the fruit fly share about 10,000-15,000 genes. Despite their shared genes, they do have their differences. During development, anterior-posterior patterning is normally regulated by the bicoid gene in Drosophila. However, in the Red Flour beetle, there is no bicoid orthologue, but instead the genes orthodenticle and hunchback substitute for bicoid in anterior patterning. Red Flour beetles are particularly useful for doing RNAi experiments. RNA interference are RNA that degrade mRNA transcripts to show a knock-down of gene function. Compared to Drosophila, RNAi have a greater response in the Red Flour beetle, making it ideal for knock-down experiments.Kumar, H. Panigrahi, M. Chhotaray, S. 2018. Red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum): From population genetics to functional genomics. Veterinary World. 11(8): 1043-1046 CRISPR technology has been shown to be useful in studying Tribolium castaneum. In one experiment, researchers used CRISPR to knock-out the E-cadherin gene. E-cadherin is a membrane bound protein of epithelial cells involved in cell-cell adhesion. This resulted in developmental issues in dorsal closure. RNAi knock-down of E-cadherin shows the same effect. Gilles, A. Schinko, J. Averof, M. 2015. Efficient CRISPR- mediated gene targeting and transgene replacement in the beetle Tribolium castaneum.

The conference's administrative offices and the office of the bishop are located in Lawrence, Massachusetts. It is part of the Northeastern Jurisdictional Conference. The bishop is the Reverend Sudarshana Devadhar (Boston Area). \\"HISTORY:\\" (SOURCE- The Wesley Center) Asbury traversed New England each of these years down to the last before that of his death. He always approached it with peculiar feelings; with mingled repugnance and hopefulness. He seemed there as in a foreign land, while all the rest of the nation was his familiar domain. Everywhere else he was welcomed by enthusiastic throngs; there he was repelled, and pursued his solitary journeys comparatively a stranger, finding refuge in families which were proscribed as heretical by public opinion, and in \\"meetings\\" which were impeached as fanatical \\"conventicles.\\" Yet he believed that Methodism would \\"radiate\\" over these elder communities. \\"I feel,\\" he writes, \\"as if God will work in these states and give us a great harvest; a glorious work of God will be wrought here. Surely we shall rise in New England in the next generation.\\" He lived to see the verification of his prediction. To him the religious life of New England presented an example of the rigid Hebrew legalism, strangely combined with the speculative dogmatism of the early Greek Church but unrelieved by the spiritual mysticism of the latter, and nearly destitute of the vital charity and joyousness primitive faith. Its distinctive theology he detested; it seemed to him to bind, as in iron bands, the souls of the people; depressing, by its tenets of election and reprobation with uncomplaining but profound distress, scrupulous, timid, and therefore often the best consciences; inflating the confidence and Pharisaism of the self-reliant or self-conceited, who assumed their predestination to heaven; enforcing the morality without the gracious consolation of religion; and giving to the recklessly immoral an apology for their lives in their very demoralization, their lack of \\"effectual grace,\\" of \\"an effectual call.\\" Devout Augustinian theologians would not indeed admit his logic; such was nevertheless his honest estimate of the New England Church, and he continually returned to the East, directing the best energies of Methodism against its traditional beliefs and ecclesiastical stagnancy. There, more than anywhere else, we have to regret the scantiness of his journals, for there, in his hardest field, his reflections as well as his facts would be most interesting to us. He re-entered it in the spring of 1804, and on the fourteenth of July opened the New England Conference at Buxton, Me. The ordination was held in a wood, where the bishop preached from a heavy heart. He describes the occasion as \\"an open time.\\" \\"The work of God broke forth,\\" he says, \\"on the right and on the left.\\" A great sensation spread among the multitude, and before the session closed it was estimated that fifty persons were converted. Snelling says, \\"There was a greater display of divine power at this Conference than any I ever attended. Many of the people were wrought upon in a very powerful manner; but, as is generally the case, there was some opposition. At one meeting a man, appearing to be in a violent passion, came in, and called for his wife, bidding her leave immediately. She urged him to stay a little longer. 'No,' said he; 'let us go.' He then started to go, but paused a few moments, then turned back, fell upon his knees, and prayed for mercy as earnestly as any. The preachers were placed in different directions in the grove, praying and exhorting. The people would gather around them in companies, similar to what are called praying circles at camp-meetings. In the circle which I was in there were eleven persons who professed to be brought from darkness to light, besides many others who were inquiring what they must do to be saved.\\" [1] \\"It was,\\" wrote Joshua Taylor, \\"the greatest time that we have seem in New England.\\" The New England Annual Conference maintains four campground/retreat centers: *Camp Aldersgate, North Scituate, Rhode Island *Camp Mechuwana, Winthrop, Maine *Rolling Ridge Conference and Retreat Center, North Andover, Massachusetts *Wanakee United Methodist Center, Meredith, New Hampshire Districts The New England Annual Conference is further subdivided into 8 smaller regions, called \\"districts,\\" which provide further administrative functions for the operation of local churches in cooperation with each other.

On April 28, 2008, again he addressed the United Nations at the inauguration of the UN's VII Indigenous Forum UNPFII - United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, with his proposed 10 Commandments to save the Planet, summarized as: :# In order to save the planet, the capitalist model must be eradicated and the North pay its ecological debt, rather than the countries of the South and throughout the world continuing to pay their external debts. :# Denounce and PUT AN END to war, which only brings profits for empires, transnationals, and a few families, but not for peoples. The million and millions of dollars destined to warfare should be invested in the Earth, which has been hurt as a result of misuse and overexploitation. :# Develop relations of coexistence, rather than domination, among countries in a world without imperialism or colonialism. Bilateral and multilateral relations are important because we belong to a culture of dialogue and social coexistence, but those relationships should not be of submission of one country to another. :# Water is a human right and a right for all living things on the planet. It is not possible that there be policies that permit the privatization of water. :# Develop clean energies that are nature friendly; put an end to energy wastefulness. In 100 years we are doing away with the fossil fuels that have been created over millions of years. Avoid the promotion of agrofuels. It is incomprehensible that some governments and economic development models can set aside land in order to make luxury cars run, rather than using it to provide food for human beings. Promote debates with governments and create awareness that the earth must be used for the benefit of all human beings and not to produce agrofuels. :# Respect for the mother Earth. Learn from the historic teachings of native and indigenous peoples with regard to the respect for the mother Earth. A collective social consciousness must be developed among all sectors of society, recognizing that the Earth is our mother. :# Basic services, such as water, electricity, education, healthcare, communications, and collective transportation should all be considered human rights; they cannot be privatized but must rather be public services. :# Consume what is necessary, give priority and consume what is produced locally, put an end to consumerism, waste, and luxury. It is incomprehensible that some families dedicate themselves to the search for luxury, when millions and millions of persons do not have the possibility to live well. :# Promote cultural and economic diversity. We are very diverse and this is our nature. A plurinational state, in which everyone is included within that state ‚Äì whites, browns, blacks, everyone. :# We want everyone to be able to live well, which does not mean to live better at the expense of others. We must build a communitarian socialism that is in harmony with the Mother Earth. =Timeline of Morales World tour= * December 30, 2005: Evo Morales visits Cuba after celebrating his democratic victory in his base town of Orinoca.

The 6th Meeting of the Commission for Monitoring Brazil-Bolivia trade was used to this end. As it stood, at the time Brazil was the main destination for exports from Bolivia, having bought, in 2007, 35.7% of the products that Bolivian companies sell to other countries. They were also the main exporter to Bolivia, sending 24.7% of products imported into Bolivia. As industrialized products represented 94.6% of Brazilian sales up to September of the year, Bolivian sales in the same period were limited largely to natural gas, which accounted for up to 92.7% of the total purchased from the country, or US$1.89 billion. The products with the greatest scope for an increase in trade from Brazil to Bolivia were crude oil, insecticides, aircraft, vehicle engines, soy in grain, vegetable oils and ironworks products, amongst others. From Bolivia to Brazil, products such as animal feed, vegetable oil, crude oil, tin, ores of precious metals, precious gems, dried and fresh fruit, plants, leather and garments were also capable of seeing sales grow.http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewiStockNews+articleid_2775227.html =Venezuela= Venezuelan relations with Bolivia were largely centered around personal relations with the Leftist leaders of the region. Hugo Ch√°vez strongly supported Morales when he came under attack from the elite in the east of his country and the United States. Following the rift with the United States, Venezuela came to Bolivia's rescue to double the country's textile exports from what it was selling to the U.S. under an agreement for lax duties that Washington suspended for the cessation of support in the War on Drugs by Bolivia. Bolivian Vice Minister, Hu√°scar Ajta said at the first round of the Bolivia-Venezuela Business Fair in La Paz that the nearly $47 million in sales was agreed to \\"double what is being exported in textiles and manufacturing to United States via ATPDEA.\\" Ajta also noted that total trade‚Äîthe agreement would be signed within the framework of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA) and the Trade Treaty of Peoples (TCP) ‚Äì \\"is three times what Bolivia [had previously] exported to Venezuela in textiles and manufacturing.\\" In like measure, the Venezuelan Minister of Production, Susana Rivero said that Venezuela \\"is not a substitute\\" for the United States, but \\"a new market with new conditions, with many facilities. This is an agreement that will allow the export sector ‚Äì even if there is a financial crisis ‚Äì to not be affected.\\" The previous year U.S. imports from Bolivia totaled $362.6 million, including $73 million worth of jewelry and about $20 million of clothing and household textile goods, as well as $64 million of tin and $46 million of crude oil. It was estimated that more than 30,000 jobs in Bolivia depended on duty-free exports to the United States.http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=320577&CategoryId;=14919 =Argentina= The Bolivian government announced the formation of a bilateral technical commission to assess the viability of supplying gas to Argentina. The Hydrocarbon Minister, Saul Avalos, said deliberations would begin upon his return from Buenos Aires on December 1 to agree on the terms, including the volume and payment commitments. As it stood at the time Bolivia exported nearly 1.7 million cubic meters of gas a day to Argentina, but was trying to redefine the terms of the contract in force, which established that 7.7 million cubic meters should have been supplied in the year, and with projected supplies of 16.6 million cubic meters in 2009 and 27.7 million cubic meters in 2010. Due to the limited extraction capacity the country was bound to promise only what it could accomplish with Brazilian internal markets priority.http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7BAC8732A0-7023-49AF-8055-408995E00C9B%7D&language;=EN Relations with Europe In summer 2013, Morales was returning from a summit in Moscow where he made comments that he would consider giving political asylum to U.S. citizen Edward Snowden. On his trip to Europe, his plane was forced to land for 14 hours in Austria after Italy, France, Spain and Portugal denied him access to their airspace on fears that Snowden was aboard the airplane. It turned out that Snowden was not on board. However, the Spanish ambassador to Austria came to the airport with two staff members to search his plane. The following week, at a summit in Cochabamba, five Latin American leaders, Argentina's Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner, Uruguay's Jos√© Mujica, Ecuador's Rafael Correa, Suriname's D√©si Bouterse and Venezuela's Nicol√°s Maduro, denounced Morales' \\"virtual kidnapping\\" and the United States pressure they believed resulted in the action. A statement at the end of the summit demanded answers from France, Portugal, Italy and Spain, but did not mention the U.S. Morales also later said \\"We don't need a United States embassy in Bolivia. My hand would not shake to close the US embassy. We have dignity, sovereignty. Without the US, we are better politically, democratically.\\" Maduro said \\"Europe broke all the rules of the game. We're here to tell President Evo Morales that he can count on us. Whoever picks a fight with Bolivia, picks a fight with Venezuela.\\" Correa said that all the leaders present were offering \\"all of our support\\" to Morales and called the move an aggression against the Americas. Russia also criticised France, Spain and Portugal said that \\"the actions of the authorities of France, Spain and Portugal could hardly be considered friendly actions towards Bolivia [...] Russia calls on the international community to comply strictly with international legal principles.\\" Though France apologised in a statement to the Bolivian government with French President Fran√ßois Hollande saying that there was \\"conflicting information\\" over the passenger manifest, Morales said \\"apologies are not enough because the stance is that international treaties must be respected.\\" Bolivia said that it would summon the French and Italian ambassadors and the Portuguese consul to demand explanations.http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/07/20137555926652236.html Peru's Ollanta Humala was also at the summit that he had arranged.

Iranian business attache Hojjatollah Soltani said his country planned to use Bolivia as a base for future Red Crescent medical programmes across the continent. On a visit to Iran, Morales also secured Iranian assistance in promotion of hydrocarbon development. Bolivia described the trip as an attempt to reach out to other states \\"rejected by the international community.\\" Morales added that the two are as \\"two friendly and revolutionary countries\\" that are strengthening ties; adding that Iran's efforts to provide economic and political backing would \\"support the peasant struggle in Latin America.\\" Iran's investments would boost bilateral economic and agricultural ties, from milk processing plants, to television and radio stations, including an agreement to provide Bolivian state television with Spanish-language programming,chron.com to funding hydroelectric exploration. Reports also indicated an interest in Bolivia's reserves of uranium and lithium for use in the Iranian nuclear program. Morales previously joked that he too is a part of the \\"axis of evil.\\" During another visit to Iran in 2010, together with then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad he said there was a need to \\"strengthen the resistance front formed by independent and freedom-seeking nations to fight against imperialism and global hegemony.\\"Press TV Relations with Libya Following Libya's establishment of diplomatic relations on August 13 and Libyan ambassador to Bolivia, Ali Farfar's, announcement of US$80 million in investments, Morales attended the thirty-ninth anniversary of the Libyan Revolution, where he met the Libyan leader Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi at Benghazi. In Libya he secured support for his government and for democratic change in Bolivia, more active trade, energy cooperation and improved diplomatic relations. The secretary of the Popular Congress, Muftah Queepe, said Libya ratified its support for the revolutionary and democratic process Morales was applying in Bolivia. Queepe praised Gaddafi's philosophy of Islamic socialism. Along with Iran, he also secured Libyan investment in Bolivia's hydrocarbons industry which, despite substantial energy reserves, was struggling to meet a commitment to pump natural gas to Argentina and Brazil. Relations with Russia Morales meeting with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow on 16 February 2009. Russia has an embassy in La Paz, and Bolivia has an embassy in Moscow. With Bolivia the focus on relations with Russia is mainly economic, as opposed to political and strategic, as an agreement to invest in Bolivia's natural gas fields shows. It is seen to \\"help Latin America...[as it] expands Latin America's economic opportunities, diversifies its relationships...that's healthy.\\"http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-11-14-voa17.cfm 2008 saw, as a first step to re-establish ties with Russia, the Bolivian government had plans to purchase a small batch of helicopters. Ambassador Leonid Golubev told The Associated Press that he would like to see Russia's ties to Bolivia one day \\"approach the level\\" of its growing partnership with Venezuela.http://www.elpais.com/articulo/internacional/Bolivia/proyecta/comprar/armamento/ruso/varios/millones/dolares/elpepuint/20090522elpepuint_10/Tes In 2009, amid improving relations between the two countries, Bolivia and Russia signed various agreements pertaining to energy and military ties, mining activities and illegal drug eradication. Relations with the United States Prior to becoming president a rift with the U.S. was foreshadowed after Morales called President George W. Bush a terrorist: \\"Bush is the only terrorist, because he is the only one who intervenes militarily in the affairs of other countries. This is state terrorism, but those who demand their rights, those people are not terrorists.\\"http://www.watchingamerica.com/cronicaar000001.shtml On September 10, 2008, Evo Morales declared the US Ambassador to Bolivia, Philip Goldberg, persona non grata‚Äîthe eighth U.S. ambassador to be declared so, which was quickly followed by the ninth. Goldberg said of the decision that \\"I regret that the Bolivian government took this decision. I think this has set back U.S.-Bolivian relations.\\"http://www.newsweek.com/id/160100 Morales had accused him of conspiring with the opposition after Goldberg was caught on film leaving the office of opposition prefect Rub√©n Costas following a secret meeting in the early hours of the morning. The U.S. reciprocated by expelling the Bolivian ambassador in Washington. Tensions grew further when Bolivia refused permission for planes from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to fly over Bolivian territory. Morales said: \\"It's important that the international community knows that here, we don't need control of the United States on coca cultivation... We can control ourselves internally. We don't need any spying from anybody.\\" Morales said his country should not fear U.S. suspension of trade preferences with Bolivia. In Vallegrande, near where Che Guevara died, he said: \\"We don't have to be afraid of an economic blockade by the United States against the Bolivian people.\\" Still, his government announced it would send a delegation to Washington to lobby for the country's continued participation in the ATPDEA, a regional trade pact with Andean states offering lowered import tariffs for cooperating with U.S. anti- narcotics efforts. Relations took a further bite when Morales ordered DEA agents to leave the country within three months from November 1, 2008. In expelling the U.S. agents, he accused them of supporting the opposition separatists, conspiring to overthrow him, spying and having killed farmers. Morales said his country can fight cocaine trafficking on its own. Morales told police officers in the administrative capital of La Paz that, \\"Some politicians say that with the withdrawal of the DEA, drug trafficking will increase ... I trust that our national police is prepared to fight drug traffickers. We're capable of funding the operations of the national police against drug trafficking.\\" This followed moves earlier in the year where the presidents anti-drug czar Felipe Caceres said Bolivia should \\"nationalize\\" the fight against the drug trade, and that the government was ready to invest about $16 million to achieve this. A 2008 annual report to the U.S. Congress cited three states, including Bolivia, for failing to fight illegal drugs, the first time Bolivia made it onto the most severe category on the list with other political opponents like Venezuela and Myanmar. Morales upped the ante and condemned the United States in saying that it has no such authority to certify whether other countries are successfully fighting drug trafficking. He added that the counter-narcotics \\"certification process of the U.S. government has to end. It's just political vengeance. It would have to be the OAS or the United Nations that would lead an effort like that.\\" =Rapprochement= In November 2008, Morales said that he wanted to improve ties with the incoming U.S. administration of Barack Obama. After addressing the U.N. General Assembly, he told the press that \\"My interest is how to improve relations with the new president. I think we could have a lot of things in common. If we talk about change I have some experience now. I think it would be good to share experiences with the new president-elect.\\" However, ominous signs were also apparent when he repeated allegations against the DEA, saying \\"The DEA will not return while I am still president. The DEA ... had an intelligence structure, but it wasn't so much to fight drugs, it had more to do with the political aggression against my government...In recent times, we've seen some officials of the DEA involved in political conspiracy.\\" He added that his government would set up a new intelligence operation involving the military and police to fight drug trafficking in place of the DEA.https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g2mGKFnTzp7SawRc5_RK1dTXgySQD94GVOM02 Later Morales met with four U.S. lawmakers to discuss the expulsion of the U.S. Ambassador. After the meeting Richard Lugar (R-In), said that the United States rejected any suggestion that it did not respect Bolivia's sovereignty or the legitimacy of its government. Morales responded that he was confident relations with the United States would improve when Obama becomes president. Vietnam and China In the light of the declining U.S. economy following the economic crisis of 2008, Bolivian trade officials looked for alternative markets to close an export gap with trade reduction between the U.S. and Bolivia. The country chose Vietnam and China in this regard. Deputy Foreign Minister Pablo Guzman said he would be looking into the possibility of signing bilateral trade agreements with the two countries. The move was said to not only cover the gap, but also expand exports in general.http://www.vnagency.com.vn/Home/EN/tabid/119/itemid/275114/Default.aspx Criticism and controversy =Dispute with the Europe Union (EU) over immigration= A new European Union (EU) immigration law detaining illegal immigrants for up to 18 months before deportation triggered outrage across Latin America, with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez threatening to cut off oil exports to Europe.Chavez: Europe risks oil over immigrant law Evo Morales wrote an open letter to the EU criticizing the new restrictions, published in the British Guardian newspaper as an opinion-editorial on June 16, 2008.\\"42 days?

The aim of the technology is to protect digital content (video or audio) from unauthorized use. Protected Streaming consists of many different techniques; basically there are two main components: encryption and SWF verification. This technique is used by the Hulu desktop player and the RT√â Player. Fifa.com also uses this technique to serve the videos on the official site. Some videos on YouTube also use RTMPE, including those uploaded there by BBC Worldwide.  Encryption  Streamed content is encrypted by the Flash Media Server \\"on the fly\\", so that the source file itself does not need to be encrypted (a significant difference from Microsoft's DRM). For transmission (\\"streaming\\"), a special protocol is required, either RTMPE or RTMPS. RTMPS uses SSL-encryption. In contrast, RTMPE is designed to be simpler than RTMPS, by removing the need to acquire a SSL Certificate. RTMPE makes use of well-known industry standard cryptographic primitives, consisting of Diffie‚ÄìHellman key exchange and HMACSHA256, generating a pair of RC4 keys, one of which is then used to encrypt the media data sent by the server (the audio or video stream), while the other key is used to encrypt any data sent to the server. RTMPE caused less CPU-load than RTMPS on the Flash Media Server. Adobe fixed the security issue in January 2009, but did not fix the security holes in the design of the RTMPE algorithm itself. Analysis of the algorithm shows that it relies on security through obscurity. For example, this renders RTMPE vulnerable to Man in the Middle attacks. Tools which have a copy of the well-known constants extracted from the Adobe Flash player are able to capture RTMPE streams, a form of the trusted client problem. Adobe issued DMCA takedowns on RTMPE recording tools, including rtmpdump, to try to limit their distribution. In the case of rtmpdump, however, this led to a Streisand effect. SWF verification The Adobe Flash player uses a well-known constant, appended to information derived from the SWF file (a hash of the file and its size), as input to HMACSHA256. The HMACSHA256 key is the last 32 bytes of the server's first handshake packet. The Flash Media Server uses this to limit access to those clients which have access to the SWF file (or have been given a copy of the hash and the size of the SWF file). All officially allowed clients (which are in fact *.swf files) need to be placed on the Flash Media Server streaming the file. Any other client requesting a connection will receive a \\"connection reject\\". The combination of both techniques is intended to ensure streams cannot be sniffed and stored into a local file, as SWF verification is intended to prevent third party clients from accessing the content. However, it does not achieve this goal. Third party clients are free to write the decrypted content to a local file simply by knowing the hash of the SWF file and its size. In practice, therefore, Adobe's own implementation of the Macromedia Flash Player is the only client which does not allow saving to a local file. The only possible way to restrict connections to a Flash Media Server is to use a list of known hosts, to avoid the whole player (the Flash client) being placed on an unauthorised website. Even this has no real benefit for mass-distributed files, as any one of the known hosts could take a copy of the data and re- distribute it at will. Thus \\"known host\\" security is only useful when the known hosts can be trusted not to re-distribute the data.

The original version was made from three large medieval nails salvaged from the Coventry Cathedral after the building was severely damaged by German bombs on 14 November 1940, during the Second World War. In the following decades, several hundred crosses have been given as gifts to various organisations, including churches, prisons and schools. The form of the cross echoes the crucifixion of Christ, and the nails with which Christ was affixed to the cross according to some accounts. In Coventry Coventry Cathedral was severely damaged during the Coventry Blitz, and its roof was destroyed on 14 November 1940. The idea for the cross came from Rev Arthur Philip Wales, who was then rector of St Mark's church in Coventry, which was also damaged in the bombing, and later rector at St Michael's church in Warmington, Warwickshire. He found several large hand- forged medieval carpenters nails as he walked through the ruins of the cathedral on the morning after the bombing. He used some wire to bind together three nails into the shape of a Latin cross, with one nail vertical and two head-to-tail as a cross-piece, and presented them to the Bishop of Coventry, Mervyn Haigh. The Cathedral's Provost Richard Howard had the words \\"Father Forgive\\" carved into the wall behind the altar of the ruined building, and two charred beams fallen together into the shape of a cross were erected among the rubble. The original charred cross is now displayed in the new cathedral, constructed after the war adjacent to the ruins of the medieval cathedral, with a replica placed in the standing ruins of the old cathedral. The original cross of nails is also retained by the new cathedral. It made a progress around the churches of the diocese in Lent 1962, returning to the new cathedral on the eve of its consecration on 25 May 1962, and is now often displayed at the High Altar, with the nails now welded into place. Elsewhere In September 1947, Richard Howard visited Kiel and presented a cross made from medieval nails found in the ruins of Coventry Cathedral to the church of St Nikolai; in return, Howard was presented with a stone from the ruins of the German church. Over subsequent years, hundreds of nail crosses have been given to various organisations, originally using medieval nails from the old cathedral but more recently using modern replicas. In many places the Coventry Cross of Nails is mounted on a wall, or displayed on an altar. The recipients of nail crosses from Coventry were brought together in 1974 to form an ecumenical \\"Community of the Cross of Nails\\", developed by Bill Williams, Provost at Coventry Cathedral from 1958 to 1981. The network of over 200 organisations in 45 countries shares a commitment to peace, justice and reconciliation. It includes dozens of churches in Germany, including the Dresden Frauenkirche, and Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church and Chapel of Reconciliation (Kapelle der Vers√∂hnung) in Berlin, and in other cities in the UK and elsewhere. At many, the Coventry Litany of Reconciliation is recited each Friday; the short prayer was written by Canon Joseph Poole in 1958. A Coventry Cross of Nails was on board the Type 42 destroyer during the Falklands War, sunk with the ship and later salvaged by Royal Navy divers. It was returned to Coventry Cathedral, kept by the next , a Type 22 frigate, from 1988 until she was decommissioned in 2002, and later presented to the Type 45 destroyer , which is affiliated to Coventry.

The strike-slip rupture originated on the Red River Fault, which had not experienced an earthquake above magnitude 7 since 1700, and affected Tonghai County, Yunnan province, China. At least 10,000 people were killed, making it one of the deadliest in its decade. The tremor caused between US$5 to $25 million in damage,This would cost roughly US$28,194,000 to $140,968,000 in 2008 US$. See Inflation Calculator. felt over an area of . In Hanoi, North Vietnam, almost from the epicenter, victims left their homes as the rupture rumbled through the city. Occurring during the height of the Cultural Revolution, it was not widely publicized by the Chinese government for well over a decade. The amount of aid and finances distributed was described by the Beijing Morning Post as \\"pathetically small\\". Much of the aid provided to survivors was in \\"spiritual\\" form, including Mao Zedong badges and condolence letters. Nevertheless, the earthquake was among the first to be studied over a long term by the Chinese government. It was cited as one of the reasons behind creating the largest earthquake monitoring system in China, 25 years later. Background and tectonics Fertile plains around Qilu Lake in Tonghai County Yunnan, the epicentral region, is one of the more seismically active Chinese provinces. The earliest earthquake recorded there was in the 9th century; however, moderate to strong ones have been observed since the 15th century. Since the 9th century, 32 earthquakes with a magnitude of 7 or greater have occurred in the province. Shallow strike-slip faulting is a characteristic of Yunnan quakes.Chen & Scawthorn (2002), p. 442. Earthquakes in southwestern Yunnan, such as the 1970 Tonghai event, are less frequent than in other parts of the province. The Red River Fault, the fault line on which this quake is alleged to have occurred, has lacked seismological activity as a whole. Red River temblors generally rise at high angles, as shown in a 1962 Ministry of Geology report.Allen et al. (1984), p. 687. Marking in sedimentary rocks indicate that several large earthquakes formed on the fault during the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs.Allen et al. (1984), p. 686. Until this quake, no earthquake above magnitude 7.0 on the Richter scale had occurred on this fault since about 1700, and the fault was believed to be \\"dead\\". Since the 1970 Tonghai rupture, it is believed that the Red River fault is instead experiencing a long seismic gap similar to that of the Japan Median Tectonic Line, on which no major temblor has formed since 700 but produced massive ones during the Holocene epoch.Allen et al. (1984), p. 689. Damage and casualties The city of Gejiu was from the epicenter. The epicenter of the quake was about southwest of Kunming and northwest of Gejiu; this area was mainly a tobacco- growing region. Effects of the rupture were felt over an area of . In Hanoi, North Vietnam, almost from the epicenter, victims left their homes as the rupture rumbled through the city. The earthquake measured 7.1 on the moment magnitude scale. It may have killed more than 15,000 people, making it the third deadliest in China during the 20th century, and injured an additional 26,783.Zchau & K√ºppers (2003), p. 482. The tremor caused between US$5 to $25 million in damage. A Reuters news report, the only one in the immediate aftermath, mentioned the recording of a \\"severe\\" quake by Hong Kong's Royal Observatory and cited an unconfirmed report that it might have destroyed part of Kunming. It caused of visible surface faulting on the Tonghai Fault. There was a maximum horizontal offset of 2.5 m (8 ft) and vertical offset of about 0.5 m (1.5 ft). As a result of inversion techniques, scientists were able to decide that several events comprised the surface faulting. This further confirmed that the earthquake, along with a later earthquake in Yunnan in 1973, corresponded to a fault within the area. Aftermath =Scientific study= The earthquake was among the first to be studied over a long term by the Chinese government. More than 40 Chinese seismologists, engineers, and geologists visited the disaster zone to conduct research into the cause and damage of the earthquake; some spending as much as a year collecting soil samples and recording other primary research evidence for future study. Such data was collected over a broad area of almost 1,400 towns within the area.Hu et al. (1996), p. 107. =Reaction= According to the Reuters report, the survivors came together to \\"fight against the disaster\\". Much of the aid provided to survivors was in \\"spiritual\\" form. The Chinese government sent tens of thousands of Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong books and badges in his honor to victims as part of the relief effort, and survivors also received 14,350 sympathy letters. However, the amount of aid and finances distributed was described by the Beijing Morning Post 30 years later as \\"pathetically small.\\" The details of the earthquake were not widely publicized by Chinese authorities until about 18 years after its occurrence. In China's first decades of Communist rule, its policy was to not disclose natural disasters or accidents unless foreigners were injured. While the Chinese official press had not released a comprehensive report, Reuters and the Royal Hong Kong Observatory both released information soon after the disaster. At the time of the quake, the Xinhua News Agency briefly mentioned a smaller magnitude quake but did not provide information on damage or casualties. On 19 November 1988, nearly nineteen years later, Chen Zhangli of the State Seismology Bureau, speaking at a news conference for another earthquake that had recently occurred, estimated the death toll of the 1970 quake to be 10,000. He did not give a reason why his government had not previously disclosed this knowledge. Government officials from China released a different estimate in 2000, putting the death toll at 15,621. China published the estimate after a memorial service for survivors and relatives was held in Yuxi on 5 January. A Yuxi Seismology Bureau official noted that the information had been classified for \\"political reasons\\" and the death toll estimate had been known among bureaucrats as early as 1997. Twenty-five years after the earthquake, the largest earthquake-monitoring network nationally was established in Yunnan. It set up earthquake offices in every county to prepare for another large rupture. The 1970 Tonghai earthquake was cited as one of the reasons behind creating the monitoring system.

It was built and was operated, in its first year, by the Westfield Corporation. It is currently operated by Muroe K Asset Management Ltd. Buildings were demolished and roads rerouted to make way for the development in 2004; but because of continued failure to secure buy-in from enough businesses, construction did not begin in earnest until January 2014: for most of the intervening years, the site had little apart from a deep excavation, though from 2010 the area round the edge of the site was laid out as an urban park. The \\"hole in the ground\\" was very unpopular in Bradford, and at one point the site was occupied by protestors.  History  In 1998 the Forster Square Development Partnership was established between Magellan Properties, Caddick Developments and the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council. They planned a 51,096 m¬≤ (570,000 sq ft) shopping centre containing Debenhams, Next, C&A;,https://www.flickr.com/photos/bradford_timeline/6161309021/in/set-72157627702593036 Marks and Spencer and 100 shops and other leisure facilities. (BHS had a store in Broadway, but it demolished as part of the demolition of the previous development on the site and C&A; also had a store on the old Broadway but closed all UK stores in 2001 and thus cancelled plans to be part of this redevelopment). The partnership sold it to Stannifer which was bought out by the Westfield Group in December 2004. Planning permission for the development was approved on 10 September 2003, with the claim that 3,000 new jobs could be created. Demolition on the Forster Square site started on 18 March 2004 and by mid-2006 the site was empty apart from a large pile of rubble. It was originally hoped that the complex would be open by late 2007 (with construction commencing in early 2006), but with a lack of anchor tenants and with many workmen still working on Westfield Derby, the start date for construction was pushed back. The delays led to Bradford Council threatening to take back control of the site from Westfield, if progress was not made. Boarded shops on Broadway on the fringes of the development; until the centre opened, shops in this area were somewhat isolated. By 2006 demolition work had freed for development a site encompassed by Hall Ings, Well Street, the new Lower Kirkgate and Charles Street. In April 2010, after several years in which no construction had taken place, the project was mothballed and work began on creating a temporary park on part of the site. The site was subsequently occupied by protesters unhappy about the lack of development. In January 2014, the park was demolished, and work resumed on the construction. The centre was opened at 10 am on 5 November 2015, by Alexandra Burke at the Forster Square entrance, and simultaneously at other entrances by representatives from Bradford City and the Bradford Burns Unit, and by the world's longest-married couple Karam and Kartari Chand. Building work began again in January 2014, beginning by demolishing the temporary urban park which had occupied part of the site since 2010.  Temporary urban park  Mural at the temporary Urban Garden In February 2010, almost 6 years after the start of demolition, Bradford Council announced a plan to convert part of the construction site into a temporary park.

He is portrayed by Joshua Jackson. Fictional character biography Peter Bishop was born in 1978, in the alternate universe, to parents Walter Bishop, also known as \\"Walternate,\\" and his wife Elizabeth Bishop. In 1985, Peter acquired an extremely rare and savage genetic disease. His father, a brilliant scientist (in both universes), worked around-the-clock to save him. Revealed in the episode \\"Peter,\\" the Walter Bishop of the prime-universe watched his own son, the prime-universe version of Peter, die because of the same disease. He would frequently watch the other Peter living in the alternate universe via a \\"trans-dimensional window,\\" which could allow someone to view the Other Side. Eventually, Walter formulated a compound and opened a doorway into the other universe, with the intentions of saving the other Peter from death. However, the vial containing the compound shattered on his way over to the Other Side, so he was forced to kidnap Peter, bring him over to the prime- universe, cure him, and then return him. But, after curing Peter on our side, he and his wife could not find themselves able to return him, so they raised him as their own. Though at first resistant to this, Peter later grew up oblivious to Walter's deception, apparently forgetting it happened. He repeatedly told Olivia Dunham that he was never fond of his father, and even recalled times when Walter experimented on him. It is implied that Walter did this to see how Peter's body reacted to moving between universes. In 1991, Walter's lab assistant, Dr. Carla Warren, was killed in a fire in his lab, and Walter was locked away inside St. Claire's Mental Institution. Peter later admits to have never visited Walter, and continued to grow up despising his father. His hatred towards Walter grew to the point that Peter took books belonging to Robert Bishop, Walter's father, and sold them for money, an action that affected Walter greatly when he discovered this in 2009. Even with his genius I.Q. level of 190, and fluency in English, Arabic, Persian, Latin, Greek, Cantonese, Russian, and Spanish, Peter became a college drop-out with gambling debts, a jack-of-all-trades, and a master con artist. He falsified a chemistry degree from MIT and managed to publish a few papers before his con was discovered. The only time he spoke to his father during Walter's initial 17-year stay inside St. Claire's was when Walter phoned to tell him that Elizabeth had died in a car crash, though Peter later discovered that she actually committed suicide because of the guilt she carried from keeping him in this universe (\\"The Man From The Other Side.\\") Additionally, Peter has trouble with the mafia because he owes an undisclosed amount of money to \\"Big Eddie,\\" a crime lord who had been hunting him for some time. =Season one= Peter was first seen setting up a business deal in Baghdad, Iraq, when he was blackmailed by Olivia Dunham to gain access to his father. Peter releases Walter from St. Claire's so he can develop a cure for Olivia's lover, John Scott, though John is discovered to be a traitor (it is revealed in episode 1x13, \\"The Transformation,\\" that John was actually an undercover agent working with the National Security Agency, and his love for Olivia was real). For the majority of the early episodes, Peter despises working with his father, and in episode 1x04, \\"The Arrival,\\" he prepares to leave Boston for good. But, he comes in contact with The Observer known as \\"September,\\" who appears to read Peter's mind. Following this incident, Peter realizes that \\"The Pattern\\" does actually exist, and vows to remain in Boston until he discovers the truth, becoming a civilian consultant for U.S. Department of Homeland Security, in the area of fringe science. By the culmination of season one, Peter and Walter appear to have completely reconciled. Peter even builds his father a device that could repair his water-damaged records, in episode 1x19, \\"The Road Not Taken.\\" By the first season finale, \\"There's More Than One of Everything,\\" Walter reveals to Peter the existence of the alternate universe, without telling him that is where he was born. Peter plays a key role in stopping David Robert Jones from opening a door to the Other Side, to kill William Bell, by closing the hole shut while Jones' body is only halfway through, slicing him in half. By this time, Walter begins leaving Peter notes explaining where he has run off to, making Peter remark to Astrid Farnsworth, \\"our little boy has grown up,\\" solidifying his newfound love for his father. =Season two= In the beginning of season two, \\"A New Day in the Old Town,\\" Olivia returns to the prime-universe after a visit to William Bell in the other dimension. She is gravely wounded on her way back and not expected to survive. A devastated Peter goes to say goodbye before she is taken off life- support, and after he kisses her forehead, Olivia awakens from her coma and cryptically tells Peter, \\"na e√≠nai kal√Ωtero √°nthropo ap√≥ ton pat√©ra sou (tou),\\" Greek for \\"be a better man than your father.\\" Olivia does not remember saying this, or her experience on the Other Side, but this phrase deeply affects Peter, who explains that his mother used to say it to him every night before he went to bed. By episode 2x04, \\"Momentum Deferred,\\" Olivia remembers meeting Bell in the other dimension, and learning of an impending war between both universes, and that an army of \\"shape-shifters\\" from the other side is working undercover in the prime-universe. Peter and Walter's reconciliation reaches its peak in episode 2x10, \\"Grey Matters\\". Thomas Jerome Newton, the leader of the shape-shifters, kidnaps Walter and forces him to reveal how he opened an inter-dimensional doorway in 1985. Peter risks everything to rescue Walter and is horrified at the thought of seeing him die. In the episode \\"Jacksonville\\", Walter reactivates Olivia's Cortexiphan abilities, allowing her to identify objects from the Other Side because of a distinctive \\"glimmer\\" they display. When she looks at Peter, he projects a \\"glimmer\\", making Olivia realize he came from the Other Side. Olivia promises Walter that she will not tell Peter the truth, feeling that some secrets are far too damaging to be revealed. In the episode \\"The Man from the Other Side\\", Walter decides he has to tell Peter the truth, but, as he is about to explain, they are called in to investigate a case. They discover that Newton is attempting to bring something‚Äîor someone‚Äîfrom the other universe into our world. The sonic vibrations released from Newton's device would inevitably kill anyone from this universe. When Peter shuts down the device and only sustains a concussion, he discovers his true origins. While receiving treatment in the hospital, he confronts Walter and blames him for his adopted mother's suicide. At the end of the episode, Olivia notifies Walter that Peter has checked out of the hospital and is on the run to resume his isolated and nomadic pre- Fringe life. Despite attempts to track him down, Olivia is unable to locate him. Peter travels to Washington state where he works with local police to solve a series of murders. He believes that Newton is responsible, but is proved wrong. However, Peter later finds Newton in his motel room, and is held at gunpoint. With Peter subdued, Newton calls out to \\"Mr. Secretary\\" (the man he pulled over from the Other Side), who is revealed to be his biological father, Walter (Walternate), from the other universe. Peter agrees to accompany his biological father to his home universe, which is captured on security cameras and sent to Olivia and Walter, who are devastated by the loss. On the other side, Peter lies comatose for three days to acclimate to his old world and reunites with his biological mother. Later, Peter reviews schematics of a machine (called the \\"Wave Sink\\" Device), which could heal his home universe, that requires his help for operation, but he later learns from Olivia, who has crossed over with Walter to find him, that his biological father intends to use the machine to destroy his adopted world. The Observers anticipated this outcome and warned Walter years ago that Peter should not return home. After Peter's return to his home world, September gave Olivia a drawing of Peter in the machine with energy emanating from his eyes. In an effort to save his life and the Prime-Universe, Olivia confesses her love for Peter, and they kiss. With this new information, Peter voluntarily returns to his adopted world with his adopted father, unknowingly bringing the parallel- universe version of Olivia, while the Olivia from the Prime-Universe is held captive in the other side by Walternate. =Season three= After returning to his universe, Peter finds it difficult being able to accept Walter's reasons for kidnapping him. In 3x02, \\"The Box\\", Peter helps thwart a terrorist attack on a Boston train station; he discovers that the ultrasonic device used for the attack is part of the weapon Walternate showed him, making him realize there are pieces of it in this universe as well. Peter also becomes romantically interested in \\"Fauxlivia\\" (the alternate Olivia), unaware that she is an impostor sent to manipulate him and Walter. Later in Season 3 in the episode \\"Entrada\\", Peter discovers the truth as prime-Olivia informs him of being trapped in the alternate Universe. After the prime universe Olivia returns, she tells Peter that her hopes of reuniting with him helped her to survive and come back, leaving Peter in a tricky situation regarding his feelings for Olivia. \\"Fauxlivia\\" returns to her home universe and finds herself six weeks pregnant, Walternate welcomes the news and offers his full support, though it seems he has an ulterior plans for the pregnancy and baby. Peter is unaware of the pregnancy or Walternate's plans. In the episode \\"Marionette\\", prime-Olivia struggles with the thought that the man she loved could not realize Fauxlivia was an impostor. She angrily declares that she does not want to be with Peter anymore, claiming \\"she's [Fauxlivia] taken everything\\". In the episode \\"6B\\" Peter and Olivia try to fix their relationship, but when they share a kiss, Olivia begins to see him glimmer and realizes she is afraid (as this ability is present when she is in a state of fear). She talks to him about it outside the bar opposite the apartment block they are investigating when she sees that the glow of the alternate universe can be seen emanating from the window of apartment 6B. Once the case is resolved, Olivia unexpectedly shows up at the Bishop's house with some whiskey to celebrate another catastrophe averted, talks to Peter, and tells him she wants to know how 'beautiful' she and Peter can be. This was in reference to his statement that any lingering thoughts he had of Fauxlivia were because he spent so much time dreaming of what it would be like to be in a relationship with Olivia and that it was, indeed, a beautiful thing. The two kiss and Olivia leads Peter upstairs, presumably to consummate their relationship. In \\"The Firefly,\\" September and The Observers resurface, hoping to correct a mistake he made 25 years prior. In the ensuing chase between them, Peter corners September on a rooftop and asks what will happen to him, if the \\"doomsday machine\\" will in fact destroy both him and this universe. However, September only cryptically states, \\"it must be difficult, being a father,\\" before shooting him with his \\"air gun,\\" knocking him unconscious. At the end of the episode, September and another Observer, December, watch the Bishop house, and reveal the reason why they orchestrated the day's events‚Äîto see if Walter is finally able to let Peter die, which he apparently is. \\"And, now we know,\\" September remarks, \\"when the time comes, he will be willing to do it again\\". In the episode \\"Bloodline\\" Peter's son is born to Fauxlivia, unknown to Peter. Much of Peter's story arc throughout the third season revolves around the doomsday device. Peter and the science team discovered that our side had another weapon, with the pieces scattered all over the world, which was originally constructed by \\"The First People,\\" the first human species on Earth. They realize that Fauxlivia's mission on our side was to locate the pieces of the machine, as Walternate's device on the other side was flawed and missing components. In \\"Reciprocity,\\" the science team visits a Massive Dynamic bunker, where they have been constructing the machine. When Peter approaches it, the machine is triggered, and his nose begins to bleed. Following this, Peter decides to start killing all the remaining shapeshifters whose identities are on Fauxlivia's computer. When Walter finds out, he is worried the machine has begun to change Peter, \\"weaponizing\\" him. In \\"6:02 AM EST,\\" Walternate activates the weapon on his side, using the DNA of Peter and Fauxlivia's baby, Henry Dunham. Through quantum entanglement, the weapon on this side is also activated, and, according to Sam Weiss, becomes \\"frustrated,\\" after Peter attempts to enter it in an effort to prevent the destruction of this universe. Using Olivia's telekinetic powers, the weapon's protective force field is dropped, and Peter manipulates it, in 3x21, \\"The Last Sam Weiss.\\" Whilst inside the machine, Peter's consciousness is propelled 15 years through time, arriving in 2026, outside the completed One World Trade Center. In \\"The Day We Died,\\" the season three finale set in 2026, Peter, 47 years old and a leading member of a more militarized Fringe Division, is married to Olivia, who has taken Broyles' place as commanding officer. In this future, after Peter entered the machine, he destroyed the Other Side. However, both universes were inextricably linked, and by destroying one, it would only be a matter of time before the side remaining would also cease to exist. After seeing Olivia dead after Walternate (who had escaped to our side before his world's destruction) killed her, he becomes depressed and an alcoholic. Walter creates a plan to bring Peter's mind from 2011 into his 2026 body, where he would witness the end of days, before returning him, with the hopes that the younger Peter would make a different choice, than destroying the Other Side, thus creating the \\"First People\\" mythos. After the Peter from 2011 experiences life in 2026, he returns to 2011, and uses the machine to create a \\"bridge\\" between both worlds, where both Walters, and both Olivias, can hopefully forget their differences to save the multiverse. However, before he can fully explain their mission, Peter mysteriously disappears, and both sides forget about him entirely, but remain dedicated to saving their worlds. A conversation between September and December reveals they forgot about Peter because he \\"never existed,\\" as he \\"fulfilled his purpose.\\" =Season Four= Because of Peter's \\"erasure\\" from existence, a new timeline develops, which while very similar to the original one, contains slight differences. Just as happened in the original timeline, Walter was locked away in St. Claire's Mental Hospital for seventeen years, until Olivia Dunham had him released in order to help her partner and lover John Scott. However, without Peter there, they were unable to save John's life. The Fringe Division of the prime- universe is still formed after this, but the characters all have subtle personality differences. Also, other events which Peter only had a slight hand in are erased entirely, such as the prime-universe version of Lincoln Lee's first meeting with the Fringe Division. Olivia lives with the constant feeling that something is missing from her life, and joined Fringe Division because she believed it would help her find answers. As a result of this, she has a much colder personality, and maintains an openly hostile relationship with double, Fauxlivia. She also managed to kill her stepfather (whereas in the original timeline she only wounded him), and was adopted by Nina Sharp, who continues to be a maternal figure in her life. Without Peter's presence, Walter has even less of a grip of reality, becoming agoraphobic, afraid to leave the lab, hypersensitive to germs that may or may not be there, and prone to destructive \\"episodes.\\" In order to cope with this, he has Astrid examine crime scenes while wearing an ear-mounted microphone and video camera, while he watches. He also sets up a bed in the lab, with an FBI agent stationed outside whenever he sleeps. Olivia appears to have a calming effect on him, and their relationship is more gentle and crutch-like than in the original timeline. In \\"Neither Here Nor There,\\" September the Observer is instructed by his superior to erase all memories of Peter that still remain despite the timeline's change. While September constructs the necessary device, brief apparitions of Peter begin appearing to his former colleagues. However, they are so brief that most do not notice, with the exception of Walter, who becomes so terrified that he hides in his sensory deprivation tank. His colleagues do not believe him due to his fragile mental state. Once the device is constructed however, September decides not to activate it, and Walter sees a reflection of Peter in the screen of his television, causing him to panic. The \\"hallucinations\\" continue, and become auditory, with Peter pleading with Walter to help him. This pushes Walter to the brink, and Olivia finds him about to lobotomize himself as a result. It is at that point revealed that she has dreams of Peter, and the two agree to try to find him, though they don't know who he is or why he is appearing to them. The situation comes to a head when a strange force appears to Olivia several times. They first think that it's another Cortexiphan child, but at the end of the episode, it is revealed to be Peter. He resurfaces (quite literally) in Reiden Lake, and is taken to the hospital, where, much to the confusion of the Fringe Division, he asks for Olivia and Walter, and reveals knowledge that no citizen should know. After revealing his knowledge of the technology the new breed of shapeshifters are using, he is brought into the Fringe Division under heavy supervision. His presence is emotionally painful to Walter, who reveals that, in this timeline, Peter died when the ice broke after they crossed over from the other universe. While he seems to believe Peter's claims, he doesn't consider himself worthy of having his son returned. Though he briefly expresses joy and wonder at seeing Peter, he quickly states that he doesn't deserve it, and that Peter was never Walter's son, leaving Peter frustrated and heartbroken. His presence also confuses Olivia, who treats him as a stranger. However, time paradoxes have begun to form, apparently as a consequence of his return. After fixing the time paradoxes, Peter concludes that this timeline is not \\"his,\\" not the one he knows with the people he knows, and he wants to go to the machine again, certain that it will take him back to \\"his own\\" timeline. Lincoln Lee later asks him if he had a relationship in the original timeline with Olivia, as Lee wishes to pursue Olivia romantically, but does not want to insult Peter if he already has a relationship with her. Peter reassures him that \\"She's not (his) Olivia\\" and therefore he has no objection to Lee pursuing her. He even purchases Lee a new pair of glasses more stylish than his current one, in order to help him. After making numerous requests, he is continually denied access to the machine and becomes increasingly desperate to return home. He confronts Walter and demands his help, but Walter emphatically refuses, as the previous time he tried to save a version of Peter, his wife committed suicide, and he lost his career and sanity. Out of options, Peter concludes that his best hope is Walternate. However, he is denied access to the newly created \\"bridge,\\" but Olivia and Lincoln offer to help him cross over using Walter's portal, which in the new timeline was recovered by Massive Dynamic after it sank to the bottom of Reiden Lake after Walter originally crossed over. Olivia and Lincoln desire his help to gather intelligence on the alternate universe, especially regarding a new and dangerous form of human-shapeshifters, which they believe are under the direction of Walternate. Peter refuses, as he believes he is neutral in the conflict and helping them would make Walternate less likely to help him. After crossing over, Lincoln and Peter make a failed attempt to gain access to Walternate and are captured by the alternate Fringe Division. However, en route to being interrogated, their driver receives a mysterious call and kills his fellow officer and attempts to frame them for the crime and execute them. However, they are able to overpower and kill him, with Lee leading the pursuing Fringe Division off on a chase as a diversion so Peter can escape. He visits his mother Elizabeth Bishop, and after convincing her of his identity, gains access to Walternate. Walternate reveals that he has been aware of Peter's reappearance in the timeline as he has been monitoring the intelligence feeds from the Prime Universe. Peter accuses him of creating the new shapeshifters and asks for his help in returning home. Walternate summons his lead scientist Brandon and asks him for confirmation that Walternate created them. Brandon denies it and Walternate unexpectedly shocks him unconscious with a special device, revealing him as a shapeshifter. He explains to Peter that the shapeshifters have infiltrated his government, and that he has no reliable way of detecting them, as the device he used on Brandon is fatal to humans. He also reveals that he had nothing to do with the Fringe agent who attempted to kill Peter and Lincoln. He asks for Peter's help in assuring the Prime Universe that he is not responsible for the new shapeshifters and asking for their help, as he believes that Peter's neutrality in the conflict makes him trustworthy. He promises Peter that he will help him return home in return for his help dealing with the threat. After Olivia begins having memories of Peter, he believes that he is psychically controlling her to become his Olivia, as she is susceptible to thoughts due to her Cortexiphan powers. He leaves her, saying it is for the best. However, after a meeting with September in which he learns that he is in his timeline after all, he joins her again and their relationship is rekindled. Personality Peter has been described as a \\"sort of jack of all trades\\", and also as a \\"brilliant person\\" who possesses \\"a lot of his father's innate intelligence\\". He is often the first person to note how insane the proposed experiments sound and tries to find logical explanations often where there are none. When he is first introduced, Peter is callous and cold to Olivia, showing little concern for Agent Scott, but he grows to become more sympathetic as details of his unhappy and often traumatic childhood are revealed. He often maintains a sardonic, cynical demeanor, but has proven time and time again to have a heart of gold. In addition, he has become far more enthusiastic about the work Fringe Division does, and his thought process has realigned itself to suit that. =Relationships= Prior to the pilot, Peter did not have a close relationship with his father, Walter. As a result, Peter grew up turning his back on science, the career field of his father. While the relationship has had many ups and downs, Peter has grown to trust and admire Walter, and consider him to be his father. In the prime timeline, Peter was in love with Olivia, but was unaware that he fathered a child with Fauxlivia, whom she named Henry, in the alternate universe. Subsequently, at the end of season 3, when Peter is removed from the timeline as though he had never existed beyond childhood, Henry, too, ceases to exist. In the alternate timeline, Peter married Olivia and had a daughter, Henrietta \\"Etta\\" (female version of \\"Henry\\"). After being taken by the observers when they invaded and reunited after 21 years, she was killed by Captain Windmark in \\"The Bullet That Saved the World\\". However, after Walter created a new timeline erasing The Observers from the future Peter, Olivia and Etta seemingly live happily ever after.

It is one of the oldest surviving brick house in the city; it was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1971 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. History The Moross House was built in 1840 by French brickmaker Christopher Moross; it was one of two homes built by him on the site.Eric J. Hill, John Gallagher, American Institute of Architects Detroit Chapter, AIA Detroit, Wayne State University Press, 2002, , p. 234 The Moross House is the oldest brick dwelling remaining in the city of Detroit. Ownership of the property changed hands several times, and included owner Colonel Freeman Norvell, son of US Senator John Norvell of Michigan. The Colonel fought at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, was a University of Michigan Regent, State Senator and co-owner of the Detroit Free Press. The Detroit Historical Commission purchased the property in the 1960s and completely restored the home from 1971 - 1973. The home was placed on the National Historic Register in 1972. The city of Detroit operated the home as the Moross House Museum and the Detroit Garden Center used the house and gardens for events, meetings, parties and sensational plantings. According to the University Michigan, the gardens contain the oldest, or second oldest, wisteria in the Midwest. In 2002 the city of Detroit sold the home and property to Mr. and Mr. Roland Scott.

The first League of Armed Neutrality was an alliance of European naval powers between 1780 and 1783 which was intended to protect neutral shipping against the Royal Navy's wartime policy of unlimited search of neutral shipping for French contraband.Armed Neutralities - International maritime law in the eighteenth century British naval commanders followed their instructions with care, ordered away boarding parties and made seizures with impunity. Four fifths of ships sailing, according to one estimate, made port in safety,Albion and Pope, Sea Lanes in wartime, p. 35 but it was the loss of the other fifth that rankled. By September 1778, at least 59 ships were taken prize-8 Danish (and Norwegian), 16 Swedish and 35 Dutch, not mentioning others from Prussia.AS, Genoa, AS. 2293, letter, Ageno to Serenissima, London, 29 September 1778 Protests were enormous by every side involved. Beginnings Empress Catherine II of Russia began the first League with her declaration of Russian armed neutrality on , during the War of American Independence. She endorsed the right of neutral countries to trade by sea with nationals of belligerent countries without hindrance, except in weapons and military supplies. Russia would not recognize blockades of whole coasts but only of individual ports and only if a belligerent's warship was actually present or nearby. The Russian navy dispatched three squadrons to the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and North Sea to enforce this decree.http://minaev.blogspot.com/2009/03/march-11-in-russian-history- armed.html Denmark-Norway and Sweden, which also ruled Finland, accepting Russia's proposals for an alliance of neutrals, adopted the same policy towards shipping, and the three countries signed bilateral agreements and then a tripartite convention forming the League in August 1780. The intention was to band their ships together in convoys and declare their cargoes not to be contraband although such a declaration would not be accepted by the British. Spain, at war with Britain, pledged to respect the League's neutrality, while Britain demurred. The Netherlands planned to join the League in January 1781, but Britain found out before the treaty could be signed and declared war after it had captured a Dutch ship bearing what the British called contraband. The Netherlands could not thus join a league of neutrals.John D. Grainger, The Battle of Yorktown, 1781: A Reassessment (Boydell, 2005), p. 10. The league members remained otherwise out of the war but threatened joint retaliation for every ship of theirs searched by a belligerent. In 1781, Prussia, Austria and Portugal joined the League; in 1782 the Ottoman Empire joined; and in 1783 the Two Sicilies. As the Royal Navy outnumbered all their fleets combined, the alliance as a military measure was what Catherine later called it, an \\"armed nullity\\". Diplomatically, however, it carried greater weight; France and the United States were quick to proclaim their adherence to the new principle of free neutral commerce. Britain, which did not, still had no wish to antagonise Russia and avoided interfering with the allies' shipping. While both sides of the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War tacitly understood it as an attempt to keep the Netherlands out of the League, Britain did not officially regard the alliance as hostile.Encyclopedia of American foreign policy, Volume 1, Editors Alexander DeConde, Richard Dean Burns, Fredrik Logevall, Simon and Schuster, 2001, Throughout the war, most of the naval supplies of the Royal Navy continued to come from the Baltic Sea. The League ceased to have any practical function after the Treaty of Paris (1783) ended the war. It was followed in the Napoleonic Wars by the Second League of Armed Neutrality, which was far less successful and ended after the British victory at the Battle of Copenhagen.

Anti-flash gear, also known simply as flash gear, is basic personal protective equipment consisting of a fire-resistant hood and fire-resistant gloves, often made of Nomex. The purpose of anti-flash gear is to provide protection to the head, neck, face and hands from short-duration flame exposure and heat. This equipment is donned by shipboard navy personnel whenever a fire breaks out or during periods of heightened readiness. Anti-flash gear may be accompanied by other protective gear, such as life belts, helmets and gas masks. While it may be worn by first-response fire-fighting parties, regular shipboard fire- fighters will usually wear full flame-resistant and insulating protective gear similar to civilian fire fighters. History Anti-flash gear was introduced in the Royal Navy following the Battle of Jutland, when a number of British warships had been destroyed or damaged by flash from burning cordite propellant passing through the shell handling room into the magazine. It was found that the anti-flash hoods and gloves were more effective if flame- proofed with borax or boric acid.

Politics Morales articulated the driving force behind MAS in the following terms: He also stated: Morales has argued for the establishment of a constituent assembly to transform the country. He also proposed the creation of a new hydrocarbon law to guarantee at least 50% of revenue to Bolivia, although MAS has also shown interest in complete nationalization of the gas and oil industries. Morales has taken a middle ground: supporting the nationalization of natural gas companies, but supporting foreign cooperation in the industry. Morales has referred to the U.S.-driven Free Trade Area of the Americas as \\"an agreement to legalize the colonization of the Americas\\" and has supported the stated desire of Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez to form an \\"Axis of Good\\" between Bolivia, Cuba, and Venezuela, in contrast to the \\"Axis of Evil\\" comprising the United States and its allies. In March 2006, President Evo Morales announced in Santa Cruz an increase in the minimum wage by 50%. As it is currently set at 440 bolivianos(45 euros) per month, it would then increase to 660 bolivianos (67 euros) per month. Morales had earlier stated that it should be increased by 100%. However, 6 out of 10 workers are part of the informal economy, thus limiting the impact of this increase. Fulfilling a campaign promise, Morales opened on August 6, 2006 an assembly to begin writing a new constitution aimed at giving more power to the indigenous majority. Education reform =Indigenous languages in schools= Morales supports a movement to teach indigenous languages such as Aymara, Quechua, and Guaran√≠ which are spoken mainly in the rural areas of Bolivia. His government estimates that only 37% of the population speaks a native language that predates the introduction of Spanish in the 16th century. Morales's Education Ministry has declared the drive to increase this percentage as part of a broad effort \\"to decolonize the mindset and the Bolivian state.\\" The program is seen as \\"emblematic of his government's indigenous-based social agenda\\". In 2006 Morales's Minister of Education and Culture, Felix Patzi, announced that he would be requiring all government employees to take indigenous language training. The Morales government's proposal to require all state schools to teach the languages has angered many urban Bolivians who see it as a move to replace Spanish. This is denied by the Morales government who point out that over half of Bolivians claim indigenous heritage and that it should not be shameful to speak an indigenous language outside of the home or local community. Patzi brought further controversy to the movement by calling Bolivians who can't speak an indigenous language \\"an embarrassment\\" and by issuing a letter stating that no school would be recognized unless they guaranteed indigenous language instruction in the 2007 academic year. =Reform of religious classes in state schools= In June 2005, Minister Felix Patzi brought organizational opposition against the Morales governments' ideas when he declared that \\"Catholicism would no longer be 'the official' religion taught at schools.\\" After mass protests led by the Catholic hierarchy this proposal was shelved by Morales. =Aftermath= Morales, initially supportive of Patzi and his policies, faced with the opposition of the Catholic hierarchy dropped the proposal to change the religion classes in state schools. Morales also relaxed the language requirement, no longer requiring it to be obligatory in 2007. In late January 2007, Morales replaced several members of his cabinet, including Patzi whose suggestions had \\"got Morales in hot water with the Roman Catholic Church\\". The Bolivian media reported that this cabinet shuffle \\"reduced the number of ministers of indigenous descent, and incorporated more middle-class politicians from the radical left to his cabinet.\\" Economy =Nationalization of natural gas industry= In 2005, following popular protests and president Gonzalo S√°nchez \\"Goni\\" de Lozada's resignation, Congress passed an energy law that added a 32% tax on production to an already-existing 18% royalty. It also required that companies renegotiate their contracts with the state. As of May 1, 2006, President Morales signed a decree stating that all natural gas reserves were to be nationalized: \\"the state recovers ownership, possession and total and absolute control\\" of hydrocarbons (Bolivia has the second largest resources of natural gas in South America ‚Äî 1.38 trillion cubic meters ‚Äî after Venezuela). He thus put to some effect his electoral promises made during the various Gas Wars, declaring that \\"We are not a government of mere promises: We follow through on what we propose and what the people demand.\\" The announcement was timed to coincide with Worker's Day on May 1. Ordering the military and engineers of YPFB, the state firm, to occupy and secure energy installations, he gave foreign companies a six-month \\"transition period\\" to re-negotiate contracts, or face expulsion. Nevertheless, Morales stated that the nationalization would not take the form of expropriations or confiscations. Vice President √Ålvaro Garc√≠a said in La Paz's main plaza that the government's energy-related revenue will jump to $780 million in 2007, expanding nearly sixfold from 2002. Among the 53 installations affected by the measure are those of Brazil's Petrobras, one of the largest foreign investors in Bolivia, which controls 14% of the country's gas reserves. Brazil's Energy Minister, Silas Rondeau, reacted by condemning the move as \\"unfriendly\\" and contrary to previous understandings between his country and Bolivia. US Exxon Mobil Corporation, Petrobras, Spain's Repsol YPF, UK gas and oil producer BG Group Plc, and France's Total are the main gas companies present in the country. According to Reuters, \\"Bolivia's actions echo what Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez, possibly Morales' biggest ally, did in the world's fifth-largest oil exporter with forced contract migrations and retroactive tax hikes ‚Äî conditions that major oil companies largely agreed to accept.\\" YPFB will pay foreign companies for their services, offering about 50% of the value of production, although the decree indicated that companies exploiting the country's two largest gas fields would get just 18%. =Nationalization of smelter= On February 8, 2007, Morales announced that a metal processing plant outside of the city of Oruro owned by the Swiss mining company Glencore International AG would be nationalized. The plant processes tin, lead, and silver. Morales said that there had been \\"a lack of transparency in its financial dealings\\" and that corporations that abide by Bolivian law had nothing to fear. He said \\"Companies that respect Bolivian laws, that do not steal money from the Bolivian people, will be respected. But if the companies do not respect the laws, I have no other alternative than to recover those companies.\\" Vinto was privatized by the Banzer government in 2000, when it was sold to London-based Allied Deals. However, Allied Deals promptly went bankrupt and was unable to meet its commitments, forcing the government to liquidate the asset. The liquidating entity Grant Thornton sold Vinto to Compa√±√≠a Minera Colquiri, owned by Compa√±√≠a Minera del Sur (51%) and Great Britain's Commonwealth Development Corporation (49%), in June 2002. Glencore purchased the plant from Comsur-CDC in 2004. Coca =Background= Licit and illicit uses Coca is the raw material for cocaine but is prized by many Bolivians (especially among those of Amero-Indian descent) for its traditional uses in medicines and herbal teas. Long before coca was used to make cocaine, the indigenous people of the Andean region, the Aymara and Quechua, chewed coca leaves as a dietary supplement, a means to ease pangs of hunger and thirst and an antidote for altitude sickness. Many Amero-Indians continue to view the plant as sacred. In modern Bolivia, coca leaves may be legally consumed and are most often prepared in teas like mate de coca. The legal sale and consumption of coca leaves are part of daily life for some groups of Bolivian peasants, especially those in mining and other fields of heavy labor. Noted celebrities who have consumed coca tea include Pope John Paul II and The Princess Royal. While a limited market exists for coca leaves, since the early 1990s the United States has put pressure on the Bolivian government to reduce the amount of coca leaves produced for refinement by the international drug trade. Plan Dignidad In 1995 at the height of coca production, one out of every eight Bolivians made a living from coca. The country was the world's third largest grower of coca after Peru and Colombia. In 1997, 458 square kilometres of land were being used to produce coca leaves, with only 120 km2 of that being grown for the licit market. In August 1997, with strong support of the US government, Bolivian President Hugo Banzer developed \\"Plan Dignidad\\" (\\"The Dignity Plan\\") to counter the \\"scourge\\" of drugs. The plan focused on eradication, interdiction (through lab destruction), efforts to counter money laundering, and implementation of social programs that countered and prevented drug addiction. The plan's heavy emphasis on plant eradication and noticeable lack of focus on trafficking organizations was noted by its critics at the time. The US Embassy in Bolivia defended the aggressive focus on crops, maintaining that Bolivia was devoid of significant trafficking organizations and claiming that the bulk of illegally exported coca went through small 'mom-and-pop' operations. This claim continues to be rejected by scholars of Bolivian society who say \\"Bolivia is very vulnerable to the influence of international trafficking organizations and that it is very likely that the participation of Bolivian entrepreneurs in the illegal business has increased.\\" During the initial years of the operation area of coca production dropped. While in 1997 it had been 458 km2, by 1998 it was down to 380 km2; in 1999 it fell to 218 km2, and in 2000 it reached its lowest point at 146 km2. Since the 1990s, the US has been funding the Bolivian government's eradication program by an average of $150 million a year. Opposition to eradication, rise of Morales Critics of the aggressive focus on farmers and the program's lack of effort against traffickers argued against the claims that Bolivia's traffickers were only \\"mom-and-pop organizations\\". They pointed out the increase in prices offered to Peruvian coca farmers during 1998 as proof that international trafficking organizations were going to Peru to make up for the Bolivian shortfall caused by the program. They also pointed to the 1999 indictment for drug trafficking of Marino Diodato who was married to the niece of President Banzer, and was an Italian believed to have Mafia and Camorra ties. By 2001 coca planting in Bolivia moved outside of the traditional growing areas of Chapare and Yungas and the area in production began to climb ever since. Along with an increase in worldwide coca production, the program contributed to a decline in the real standard of living of Chapare peasants leading to protests and violent social unrest (where both demonstrators and police were slain). The Bolivian government's use of the military in coca-growing regions during the unrest brought criticism from NGOs such as Human Rights Watch. Promises of alternative development for farmers stagnated because of worsening external economic conditions. These conditions caused social mobilization among coca farmers like Evo Morales who called for an end to forced eradication and other measures enacted with the intent of countering narcotics. From 2000 forward, the Bolivian government made several agreements with coca grower federations to end confrontations, but they failed to follow through on their promises causing further opposition to these governments. Morales rose to national attention by leading the political opposition to eradication and this position is a central reason for his election to the Bolivian Congress. His association with anti-eradication forces caused his expulsion from Congress in 2002 which led to his presidential campaign with its surprising showing that same year. Morales coalition prevails Pressures from the Morales-led coalition caused president Gonzalo S√°nchez de Lozada to stop forced eradication. To address some of his opponents concerns in 2003 he initially proposed allowing families to cultivate small plots of coca but in the face of strong pressure from the US Embassy he withdrew the idea. Gonzalo S√°nchez de Lozada resigned the presidency due to the Bolivian Gas War. When his successor Carlos Mesa was unable to stem the increasing conflict over distribution of wealth from fossil fuel production he also resigned. Morales's support from coca farmers was seen as a large reason for his victory to the open presidential office in the 2005 election. On his way to vote during the 2005 election Morales carried a coca plant. After it was declared that he was the front runner in the election he called for a referendum on how the plant should be controlled. Countering US fears that he would ignore coca cultivation expressly done for narcotic purposes Morales said, \\"There won't be the free cultivation of the coca leaf.\\" He also called on America to enter into an agreement with Bolivia to truly fight drug trafficking. He repeated his position calling for \\"zero cocaine production and zero drug trafficking, but not zero coca growing or zero cocaleros [coca growers].\\" He announced his government would study whether the amount of coca allowed for legal traditional consumption should be increased. At the time coca growing was legal on 29,000 acres (120 km2) of the Yungas valley with lesser area in the Chapare region. =Morales Presidency= In early 2006, soon after taking office, Morales traveled to the tropical region of Chapare and met with a crowd of 20,000 consisting mainly cocaleros. A garland of coca leaves was placed around his neck and more leaves placed upon a straw hat he donned to shield him from the sun. He told the crowd, \\"The fight for coca symbolizes our fight for freedom. Coca growers will continue to grow coca. There will never be zero coca.\\" There is much disagreement between Morales's administration and the United States regarding anti-drug laws and cooperation between the countries, but officials from both countries have expressed a common desire to work against drug trafficking, with Sean McCormack from the U.S. State Department reinforcing the support of Bolivian anti-drug policy, and Morales repeatingly calling for zero cocaine production and zero drug trafficking. Processing plant In February 2007, Venezuela loaned Bolivia $250,000 to build two coca processing plants in Chapare and Las Yungas to turn coca into tea and trimate (a mixture of aniseed, chamomile and coca). The plants are set to be up and running in September or October 2007 and the products will likely be sold in Venezuela. Constitutional Assembly One of Morales's electoral promises was to establish a Constitutional Assembly to re-write the Bolivian constitution. This was also one of the central demands of the Bolivian social and indigenous movements who supported Morales's candidature for the presidency.Bolivia Information Forum Bulletin No 2 Towards the Constituent Assembly A Constitutional Assembly was established and elections for assembly members were held in July 2006.Bolivia Information Forum Bulletin No 3 The Constituent Assembly results The Assembly then sat in Sucre, in the Teatro Gran Mariscal and was given 12 months to write a new Bolivian constitution.

It occurred between 1800 and 1801 during the War of the Second Coalition and was initiated by Paul I of Russia. It was a revival of the First League of Armed Neutrality (1780), which had been quite successful during the American War of Independence in isolating Britain and resisting attempts to interfere with their shipping. The Second League was less successful than the First. The Second League was intended to protect neutral shipping against the Royal Navy's wartime policy of unlimited search of neutral shipping for French contraband, in an attempt to cut off military supplies and other trade to the First French Republic. The British government, not yet anxious to preserve Russian goodwill, openly considered it a form of alliance with France and attacked Denmark, destroying parts of its fleet in the first Battle of Copenhagen and forcing it to withdraw from the League. Britain also occupied the Danish West Indies between March 1801 and April 1802. In addition to this, Prussia invaded Hanover in April 1801 as a way to attack the British. Paul's assassination in March 1801 and the accession of Alexander I led to a change of policy in Russia, and the alliance collapsed. Russia later joined the British in a coalition against Napoleonic France. Legacy The prospect of a third league of armed neutrality potentially including Britain and France was briefly proposed in the 1860s, during the American Civil War, following the Trent Incident in which the US Navy stopped a British vessel and removed two Confederate diplomats. Ultimately the two countries did not form a league but maintained the principle of the freedom of the seas, and both remained neutral.

Main sources  History of Liao of 1344 was compiled using older sources, mainly: * the Shilu ÂØ¶ÈåÑ (Veritable Records), completed in the Khitan Liao dynasty (907-1125) under Yel√º Yan ËÄ∂ÂæãÂÑº's direction, no longer extant; * a draft Liao Shi, compiled in the Jurchen Jin dynasty under the direction of an official named Chen Daren Èô≥Â§ß‰ªª, never published and no longer extant; * and several other sources such as the Zizhi Tongjian (1080's), Qidan Guo Zhi and other descriptions of the Khitans in the previous dynastic histories (Wei Shu, Sui Shu, ...). The Liao Shi contains 116 volumes, including 30 volumes of Imperial Annals, 32 volumes of Records of Institutions, 8 volumes of Tables, 48 volumes of Biographies and Descriptions, and 1 volume of Glossary of National Language ÂúãË™ûËß£ Guoyijie (the Khitan language),pp. 123-125 Howorth, H.

Creation and reliability  Many Chinese scholars of the time argued that the non-Han, \\"barbarian\\" Liao dynasty did not merit its own official history, but rather posited that the Liao histories should be an addendum to the history of the Song, which was ethnically Han Chinese. This was part of the larger dispute between the Mongol court and the Chinese literati scholars, in which the Chinese political theory whereby only one dynasty could be deemed legitimate at a time clashed with the Mongol's beliefs to the contrary.Hok-lam Chan, p.73 Due to this dispute between two different political cultures, the Liao Shi, as well as the histories of the concurrent Jin and Song dynasties, was not officially compiled until 1343‚Äì1344, when the pro-Chinese Chief Councillor Toqto'a took up the pre-Yuan histories project again. In its final form, this project conceded to the Mongol court's desire to treat the Liao, Jin, and Song as equally legitimate dynasties. The compilation of the Liao Shi was finished in one year by imperial historians, although without undergoing any but the most minimal of proofreadings. Because of this, the Liao Shi and the other two pre-Yuan histories are known for their technical errors, lack of precision, inconsistencies in transcribing non- Chinese terms and names, and over-lapping subject matter. Qing scholars Qian Daxin and Zhao Yi noted inconsistencies in the History of Liao in their works Study of the Discrepancies in the Twenty-two Standard Histories Âªø‰∫åÂè≤ÂäÑË®ò and Critical Notes on the Twenty-two Histories ‰∫åÂçÅ‰∫åÂè≤ÂäÑË®ò. Nonetheless, the Liao Shi provides a large amount of knowledge on Khitan's imperium's tribal politics and traditions. Since Yel√º Yan's Shilu and Chen Daren's Liao Shi have been lost, Toqto'a's Liao Shi is the only extant Chinese-style historical record of the Khitan empire.  Editions  The work of collation and punctuation have been done several times,Xu Elina-Qian, pp.22-23 by example in the Qianlong edition, the Nanjian edition, the Beijian edition, Baina edition and the Daoguang edition. The nowadays commonly use edition is the Zhonghua Shuju Press edited Liao Shi, under direction of the Khitan studies' specialists Feng Jiasheng and Chen Shu, and based on the Baina edition. This Zhonghua Shuju Press version and its annotations also refer to other historical sources such as the Cefu Yuangui, Zizhi Tongjian, Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian, Jiu & Xin Tangshu, Jiu & Xin Wudai Shi, Song Shi, Jin Shi, Qidan Guo Zhi and Liao Wenhui.ÈÅºÂè≤, ËÑ±ËÑ±, ‰∏≠Âçé‰π¶Â±Ä, 1974. The History of Liao was translated into Manchu as (Wylie: Dailiyan gurun i suduri, M√∂llendorff: Dailiyan gurun i suduri). The Qing dynasty Qianlong Emperor erroneously identified the Khitan people and their language with the Solons, leading him to use the Solon language to \\"correct\\" Chinese character transcriptions of Khitan names in the History of Liao in his \\"Imperial Liao Jin Yuan Three Histories National Language Explanation\\" (Ê¨ΩÂÆöÈÅºÈáëÂÖÉ‰∏âÂè≤ÂúãË™ûËß£ Qinding Liao Jin Yuan sanshi guoyujie) project. Qianlong's \\"corrections\\" ended up compounding the errors and making the transcription of some foreign words even worse. Marshall Broomhall wrote that So unscientific was this work that the K'ien-lung editions of the Liao, Kin, and Y√ºan histories are practically useless. Emil Bretschneider demonstrated how the etymologies in the Qianlong edition were incorrect. Content The annals are covered in Volumes 1-30 beginning with founder Abaoji (Taizu) in volumes 1‚Äì2. Volume 30 covers Yel√º Dashi, who fled and founded of the state of Qara Khitai also known as the Western Liao at the dissolution of the Liao dynasty. Biran describes volume 30 of the text as the one of the most important sources for the history of the Qara Khitai. Treatises are covered in volumes 31‚Äì62. The administrative divisions of the Liao are described in volumes 37 through 41 under the title Geography (Âú∞ÁêÜ), organized by the five primary level circuits (ÈÅì). Official posts (ÁôæÂÆò) are described in volumes 45‚Äì48. Standen gives English translations for some of the official posts in a glossary. Volumes 63-70 are tables including the lineage of the ruling Yel√º clan as well as other clans in volume 63, tribes (ÈÉ®Êóè) in volume 69, and vassal states (Â±¨Âúã) in volume 70. Notable figures included in the Biographies section include Han Yanhui, Liao chancellor of Han origin in volume 74; Zhao Yanshou general from the Later Tang who also served the Liao in volume 76; and Wang Jizhong ÁéãÁπºÂø†, who helped broker the Chanyuan Treaty of 1004‚Äì1005 in volume 81. Legacy The debate about the legacy of the Liao as a legitimate dynasty continued after the completion of the text. Around the time of publication Yang Weizhen stated that only the Song was a legitimate dynasty and the Liao and Jin were usurpers. He continued to argue this point and composed an essay titled 'On legitimate Succession' Ê≠£Áµ±ËæØ. Ming scholar Wang Zhu ÁéãÊ¥ô wrote an alterative history of the Song titled Verified History of the Song ÂÆãÂè≤Ë≥™ in which the Liao and Jin states were relegated to treatises on foreign states. However, Wang Chu's text received criticism itself from Qing scholars who viewed it as an intentional distortion of history. In addition, the text Great Outline of Historical Records by Ming scholar Shao Jingbang ÈÇµÁ∂ìÈÇ¶ (1491-1561) gave the Liao and Jin the status of alien usurpers.

They were particularly well known for their three wheelers. It was one of the oldest milk float manufacturers lasting from the early 1940s to the early 1990s. In 1989, the company was acquired by Smith Electric Vehicles. Major customers included United Dairies (later known as Unigate) and in the early years, Express Dairies. The basic design evolved throughout W&E;'s existence before finally ending its days as the Rangemaster. History The first Wales & Edwards milk float produced for United Dairies in 1951 The company began life as a garage which acted as an agency for Morris and Wolseley cars. In the early 1940s, they serviced cars and sold petrol, as well as having the car salesroom. As part of the war effort during World War II, the garage was divided into two, with one half servicing cars for essential users, such as doctors, vets and farmers, and the other half servicing Morris 15 cwt Quads and Mobile workshops for the army. They also worked on parts for Spitfire aircraft, and the workforce was swelled by a number of Italian prisoners of war during this period. The company diversified once hostilities had ceased, and Mervyn Morris produced designs for a battery electric vehicle. Staples such as bread and milk were delivered in many parts of the country by horse and cart, and the electric vehicle developed into a cheaper solution for milk deliveries. Roddington Dairy was the first to order a vehicle, which was delivered to them in early 1951. A base for manufacturing the vehicles was set up at Harlescott, a suburb to the north of Shrewsbury, and they obtained wiring harnesses from Hartley Electromotive, an electrical engineering company which had moved to Monkmoor, to the east of Shrewsbury, in 1949. In 1951, United Dairies circulated a specification for a milk delivery vehicle to a number of potential manufacturers, who were asked to produce prototypes. W&E; were assisted in this by Mickleover Transport, a subsidiary of United Dairies, who were responsible for managing the transport needs of the company. The prototype was tested, and two significant changes were made before production started. The transmission was replaced with a modified design, for which Mickleover obtained a patent, and the electrical control gear was made more robust. By 1953, some 700 were in service, and W&E; were able to make them available to other customers. United Dairies placed an order for a further 1,250 vehicles in mid-1953. The vehicle was a 3-wheeled design, with a single wheel at the front, steered by a tiller, and two powered wheels at the back. The turning circle was just , and the motor had a chain drive to a bevel shaft, which included a rubber-bonded coupling, to reduce starting and braking torque. This gave good starting performance, even when there was snow or ice on the road surface. Batteries were located beneath the driver's seat, and the 29-volt motor was controlled by a Sharp contactor and four-stage controller. According to The Transport Museum, Wythall, which has amassed a large collection of milk floats, the first W&E; vehicle was supplied to United Dairies in 1951. Despite its limited protection for the driver, it was an immediate success, and United Dairies placed an order for a further 1,500 vehicles. The 3-wheeled design was the mainstay of W&E;'s production, with United Dairies eventually ordering over 3,000 more. When the first vehicle, which carries the registration number XMT 422, reached the end of its working life, it was returned to W&E;, who subsequently donated it to the Transport Museum, where it can be seen, restored to its 1952 condition. A Freightliner belonging to Howards Dairies, No. 670, registration OHJ 420F delivering milk to cafes by Southend Pier, Essex, around 1970 A 5-wheel Loadmaster milkfloat, built in 1963, registration number 8505 PF, and now preserved at the Transport Museum, Wythall On the early vehicles, the control panel and tiller gear were covered by two metal panels, and some protection was offered to the driver by a canvas screen. In 1955, Mickleover Transport designed and made a front cowl to replace the panels, which was made of glasspol, a polyesther resin reinforced with glass-fibre matting. The cowls were initially fitted to 100 vehicles, and improved access to the control panel and tiller gear. They contained orange pigment, of the same colour as the United Dairies livery, which meant that they did not have to be painted once manufactured. Mickleover Transport intended to fit them to a large number of vehicles. In 1956, W&E; introduced a 25 cwt vehicle where the complete cab was made of glasspol. The cab included draught deflectors at the sides, to improve the protection of the driver. They also displayed a standard 25-30 cwt chassis fitted with an Enfield 1.13 litre two-cylinder oil engine at the 1956 Dairy Show, for use in areas which were particularly hilly. The engine was air-cooled, and coupled to a 3-speed gearbox, but the concept was short lived. In 1961, the company added a 5-wheeled articulated milk float to their range, designed for a payload of 2 long tons, and known as the Loadmaster 2 tonner. Only 18 were ever built, before production ceased in 1966. One of them remained in service with United Dairies until 1992, by which time it was based in Eastbourne. The trailer was rebuilt from an open-sided dairy vehicle to an enclosed box van in 1985, and on withdrawal, it was donated to the Wythall Transport Museum, who have since rebuilt the trailer in its original form. W&E; felt that the maximum payload for their three-wheeled float was 30 cwt, and such a model was known as the Major. Bigger payloads required a four-wheeled float, and the Freightliner was showcased at the 1966 Royal Dairy Show. It came as a 50 cwt model and twin tyres were fitted on the rear axle. In order to retain the manoeuvrability of the three-wheeled vehicles, the front springs and steering drag link were placed inside the frames, which allowed a kerb-to-kerb turning circle of to be achieved. The wheelbase was , with the cab located in front of the front wheels, to give easy access to the driving position. Three models were available, with top speeds of , and . The working range was from , and a series resistance controller was fitted as standard, although the model at the Dairy Show had a thyristor control unit. =Acquisition= Following changes in legislation which allowed milk to be sold by supermarkets and garages at lower prices than the home delivery dairies could charge, sales of milk floats plummeted. Wales & Edwards saw a drop in orders of 70 per cent in a single year. Attempts to find other markets for the vehicles failed, and in 1989 the company was sold to Smith Electric Vehicles, who were based in Gateshead. Customers W&E; supplied large numbers of floats to United Dairies, who had provided the original specification. They also supplied Express Dairies, who supplied milk over an area of some in the London area. In 1963 they had a total fleet of around 2,200 battery electric road vehicles, of which 200 were Standard 3-wheelers, 190 were the 25-cwt Rangemaster model, and three were the Loadmaster articulated model. The Transport Museum, Wythall, located to the south of Birmingham, have five W&E; vehicles on display. There are two Standard models, the original model with an open cab dating from 1950 which belonged to United Dairies, and another dating from 1958, with a protected cab, which belonged to Handsworth Dairies, located in the West Midlands. A Birmingham Dairies Intermediate model dates from 1965, and there is a 1968 Rangemaster which was operated by the same company. The fifth vehicle is a 1963 Loadmaster articulated float.

The orchestra is drawn from musicians of the State Opera and the Czech National Theatre, and most of its concerts take place at the opera house.  Recording  The orchestra play and record music for every type of orchestral project including CD albums, major international films, television series, video games and even ringtones ‚Äî both for the Czech Republic market but chiefly for clients and media productions all around the world. It works with labels such as Decca, EMI, Sony BMG, Silva Screen Records, Tadlow Music, etc. and many international film studios. The orchestra plays more than 250 recording sessions every year and that makes it one of the most recorded and respected orchestras in the world. Also the orchestra recorded many international movie scores. Recordings have been made for film production companies such as Paramount, Sony, Lucasfilm and many others at Smecky Music Studios. David Lynch returned again in 1997 to record his Lost Highway, and yet again in 2001 to record Mulholland Drive. Credit list consists of acclaimed composer names like Alexandre Desplat, Rachel Portman, Mychael Danna, Jeff Danna, Ludovic Bource, Gabriel Yared, Steven Lebetkin, Steve Barakatt and many more. They also created Leading Britain's Conversation's primary jingle. Hybrid (British band) worked with the orchestra on their studio albums Disappear Here (Hybrid album) and Light of the fearless, as did the band Enter Shikari for the song Elegy For Extinction on their record Nothing is True & Everything is Possible released in 2020.  Concerts  In recent years the orchestra has performed many concerts of classical and film music repertoire throughout Europe but especially Germany, where it is the ‚Äúin house‚Äù orchestra for Klassik Radio. Now, with the international acclaim for their prize winning recordings, the orchestra is receiving requests for more and more live concerts around the world. These requests peaked with the orchestra performing in front of an audience of 20,000 in Santiago, Chile with conductor Nic Raine and guest soloist Itzhak Perlman.

Still was born in Bathurst, New South Wales. A tall round arm bowler who could generate movement off the pitch, he proved an effective opening bowler. In his first match against Victoria, he opened the bowling, taking 4/23 off 11 overs, and in the second innings, he combined with opening partner, Robert McDowall to skittle out the Victorians for a paltry 50 off 18 overs. Still claimed 3/24 off 9 overs, and McDowall took 5/23 off 9. Between the two, they claimed 15 wickets to set up an 8 wickets victory for the Tasmanians. He did not play another game for Tasmania until the 1857-58 season, when he was recalled to face the Victorians again. Tasmania were demolished for 33 on a damp green pitch, with Gideon Elliott taking an astonishing 9/2 off 19 overs. The Victorians replied with 115, Still claiming 3/21 off his 18 overs. Tasmania was again bundled out, this time for a slightly better 62, but it handed Victoria victory by an innings and 20 runs, with Still not required to bowl in a second innings, his first class career had ended. Robert Still died in Launceston, Tasmania at the age of 85 years.

It was released in 2007 by Rio Grande Games. Its theme is to build galactic civilizations via game cards that represent worlds or technical and social developments. It accommodates 2-4 players by default although expansions allow for up to 6 players, as well as solo play. The game uses iconography in place of language in some places, with complex powers also having a text description. While appreciated by experienced players for being concise, some new players find the icons difficult to learn and decipher. The game won Boardgamegeek's Golden Geek Award for best card game, Fairplay Magazine‚Äôs √Ä la carte award for best card game of 2008, and was described by the magazine Tric Trac as \\"LE jeu de cartes de cette ann√©e 2008\\" (THE card game of the year 2008). Gameplay Like many other Euro-style games, players win Race by having the most victory points at game end. VPs come from three sources: worlds and developments placed on a player's tableau, and VP chips earned by consuming goods from worlds. To place a world or development, players pay a cost in cards from their hand. Keeping a steady income of new cards throughout the game is important to victory. = Phase selection = At the start of each round, all players simultaneously and secretly choose one of five phases: Explore, Develop, Settle, Consume, or Produce. Selections are revealed simultaneously. The only phases which actually occur in a round are those selected by players. Additionally, the players who picked a certain phase get a special bonus during that phase, such as the ability to look at more cards during the Explore phase. Every card in play has powers which are active during various phases. For instance, the development \\"Investment Credits\\" has a Develop power which makes placing developments one card cheaper. A possible starting world from the base game, Epsilon Eridani. This world is worth 1 victory point and has powers during the settle and consume phases (III and IV). = Round play = Within a round, phases (those selected by players) happen in the following order: # Explore ‚Äì Draw two cards and keep one. # Develop ‚Äì Play a development. # Settle ‚Äì Play a world, either by paying to take it peacefully or by military conquest. # Consume ‚Äì \\"Ship\\" resources for cards and VPs. As a bonus activity, players can Trade a resource to earn many cards, but no VPs. # Produce ‚Äì Put a good (a face-down card from the deck) on all production worlds that do not have one. After all phases are complete, players discard down to a hand limit of 10 cards. Unusually among card games, cards discarded due to the hand limit or when paying a cost are placed face-down (in a \\"messy\\" pile to distinguish them from the draw deck), concealing information that could be used to deduce upcoming draws. Play continues until, at the end of a round, either at least one player has 12 or more cards in their tableau, or the entire starting pool of victory point tokens has been claimed by the players. At that point, the player with the highest total of victory points from tokens and from cards in their tableau is the winner. =Race vs. other titles= The play style of the game is similar to that of another Rio Grande game, San Juan, which is the card game version of the board game Puerto Rico. Lehmann, Race's designer, developed his own card game version of Puerto Rico at the request of the publisher. Some of its ideas were incorporated in San Juan. Later, Lehmann used those ideas to create a different game, one of space exploration, settlement, and conquest rather than development in the colonial Caribbean. The principal difference in the playing sequence between Race and Puerto Rico/San Juan is that in the latter games, a given phase can only be chosen by one player each round, and the order of activities is based on player order and the phases each player picks in succession; in Race, multiple players may choose the same phase, and the order of activity execution is fixed. Wei-Hwa Huang, who is credited as a development assistant for Race, went on to become the primary designer of Roll for the Galaxy (assisted by Tom Lehmann). In this adaptation six-sided dice represent a player's workers, with rolls determining what phases workers are placed in. Expansions Gameplay with the base set. 10 cards have been played in one player's tableau, so the game is likely to end soon During playtesting, plans were made for two expansionsRace for the Galaxy Designer Preview #1: Race for the Galaxy Designer Preview #3: to add more variety to gameplay, shore up certain strategies, and to accommodate more players. The game's success prompted the publisher to request a third expansion, as well as new expansions not requiring the original trio.BGG forum post by Lehmann: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/3692801#3692801 Currently there are five expansions for Race. The first three expansions, Gathering Storm, Rebel vs Imperium, and The Brink of War, comprise the first expansion arc. These expansions thematically focus on a struggle for galactic control between the militarily powerful Imperium and a Rebel uprising. The second arc, which is designed to be played separately from the first, includes only the expansion Alien Artifacts, about the revival of long-dead Alien overseer technology. In the third arc the Xeno Invasion set chronicles a catastrophic invasion by monstrous \\"Xenos\\" from a distant world. All the expansions provide new game cards, starting worlds, and support for at least five players. Many new mechanics also interact with base set keywords, such as \\"Rebel\\" or \\"Uplift\\". =The Gathering Storm= The first expansion adds components for a fifth player, additional cards, goals (opportunities to gain extra victory points chosen at random at game start), and rules and components for solo play (against a \\"robot\\" player).\\"Game Preview: Race for the Galaxy: The Gathering Storm\\" , By Tom Lehmann, September 26, 2008, Boardgame News. =Rebel vs Imperium= The second expansion is intended for use with the first expansion. It adds components for a sixth player, more cards and goals, and direct player interaction in takeovers of other players' military worlds; players who refrain from playing certain cards are immune to conquest. Takeovers are optional and the rules for this expansion encourage trying the game both with and without them. This set also introduces many new Rebel and Imperium Cards and introduces a special 2 player scenario where one player takes the role of The Imperium while the other starts with a Rebel homeworld. In this variant the starting hands consist partly of Imperium/Rebel cards and takeovers are allowed. =The Brink of War= The third expansion adds still more cards, and goals, as well as a new mechanic called galactic prestige. Each round the player(s) with the most prestige earn an additional victory point and possibly a card. Each prestige is worth one victory point at the end of the game, and many of the new cards allow prestige to be spent (for victory points, cards, or other effects). Additionally, a new \\"once-per-game\\" action is introduced that allows the user to search the deck for a card meeting a specific stated requirement, or to enhance the bonus the user earns in a round (at the cost of one prestige). The set further extends takeover options: the Interstellar Casus Belli development can allow attacks against anyone, and the Imperium Planet Buster can destroy enemy worlds outright. =Alien Artifacts= The fourth expansion is used with only the base game and was released during 2013. It includes new explore powers and an optional \\"orb game\\" in which players explore for victory points and new powers. Some players have criticized the gameplay of the orb game while praising the game cards in the set, saying that the orb makes the overall game play non-simultaneously and last too long. =Xeno Invasion= The fifth expansion, published 2015, is for use with the base game only. According to Lehmann, \\"XI is aimed at intermediate players\\" and has the most new base cards of any expansion so far. It allows for up to 5 players, and in addition to new world and development cards it includes an optional \\"Invasion Game\\", in which players must defeat three waves of Xeno alien invaders. Players can earn bonuses by contributing to the war effort, but the game can also end in two new ways: repulsing the Xeno threat or losing to the invaders.

The pressure inside the tire is measured using a pressure transducer with the pressure information being subsequently sent to the vehicle to warn the driver of under or over inflation of a tire. The pressure information is commonly transmitted to the vehicle using radio frequency (RF) technology, though systems using mechanical, electrical or magnetic methods have been used over recent years.Hawes, p. 2. Typical system VDO In most current designs of direct TPMS, a small electronic assembly which is rugged enough to be mounted inside a tire, measures the pressure using a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) pressure sensor and then transmits this and other information to one or more vehicle receivers. Other information can include a serial number, temperature, acceleration and the status of the complete tire pressure monitoring system.Hawes, p. 123. The purpose of the serial number is to allow the vehicle to ignore transmissions from other vehicles and operate with a unique data field. A typical direct TPMS (e.g. Ford,Hawes, p. 185. BMWHawes, p. 51. or ToyotaHawes, p. 690.) comprises the following components on a vehicle: * A direct TPM sensor fitted to the back of the valve stem on each wheel * A TPM Warning Light * Unique identifier (IDs) for which tire is providing the data including speed and the direction of rotation * A tire pressure monitor electronic control unit (ECU) * Antenna(s) * Controller for periodic measurements * Source of power * Diagnostics and wake up system Most direct TPMS systems use ultra high frequency (UHF) radio in one of the 'unlicensed' ISM bands (industrial, scientific and medical) for transmitting the data,http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/terrestrial/faq/index.html often around 434 MHz in Europe and 315 MHz in much of the rest of the world. On some systems there is a separate receiver or antenna near each wheel whilst more commonly there is a single receiver which receives data from all of the wheels on the vehicle. Commonly this receiver is also used for remote keyless entry system (RKE) as this also usually uses UHF radio transmissions. TPM sensors can be fitted to the wheels in a number of ways. They can be mounted on the back of the tire's valve stemHawes, p. 3. or attached using adhesive or to a band which is then securely wrapped around the rim inside the tire, usually in the drop zone.Hawes, p. 459. =Direct tire pressure monitor system warning light= When the direct TPMS warning light comes on, either one of the tires is under-inflated, severely over-inflated, or there is a fault with the system. If the light is constant then inflating to the correct placard pressure should turn it off. If this is not the case then this indicates a puncture. If the light is intermittent or if it stays on after correct inflation or replacement of a punctured tire then this indicates a fault with the direct TPMS system. =Registration of direct TPMS IDs= When the direct TPMS system is fitted at the factory the unique ID numbers of the TPM (tire pressure monitoring) sensors have to be registered along with their position on the vehicle with the tire pressure monitor ECU. This is also the case if any of the system components are subsequently changed e.g. in the event of rotating the tires, changing sensors, replacing the ECU etc. This process requires the activation of the direct TPMS sensor using low frequency (LF) radio and the capture of the UHF data transmitted. This data includes the direct TPMS ID, the pressure and the temperature. In automotive manufacturing plants, the activation is carried out using large antenna systems whilst in the dealerships and tire shops, hand tools are used. These tools can also be used to check the direct TPMS for faults prior to disassembly. If a TPM sensor or its position on the car are changed without re-registering the IDs, then the TPMS warning light will turn on and stay on until the IDs are re- registered.. Localisation If there are multiple antennas or receivers, this permits localisation of the TPM such that the vehicle can tell from which wheel the pressure data has come. As an alternative to this method, the vehicle can be programmed at the time of manufacture with the position of the tire together with its TPM serial number. This allows the vehicle to display which tire has low pressure.http://www.wipo.int/pctdb/en/wo.jsp?wo=2006104484&IA;=WO2006104484&DISPLAY;=DESC Also, some vehicles have low frequency radio transmitters mounted near to each wheel which can be used to force the individual TPMs to transmit at will. These typically use similar technology to 125 kHz RFID tags where the transmitted field is predominantly magnetic and can be easily detected by a small LF antenna located in the TPM. This method of localisation is often referred to as a high line system. The LF antenna is also often used by the TPM for configuration and to force transmission so that localisation can be re-learned by the vehicle if a sensor is changed or the wheels rotated to even up tread wear. A third method uses the UHF signal strength which is proportional to the distance of the TPM from the receiver. If the receiver is located towards the front of the vehicle, the signal from the front wheel TPM's will be stronger than that from the wheels at the rear. The TPM also has a method of detecting the rotational direction of each wheel to identify which side of the vehicle the TPM is located and this information forms part of the message transmitted to the vehicle. This combination allows the correct wheel to be identified. TPM sensor features The TPM sensors currently fitted to high volume production cars worldwide are battery-powered, self-contained units which periodically measure tire pressure, and often temperature and acceleration. The sensor is equipped with an RF transmitter circuit which is used to broadcast the measured pressure etc. within the tire.http://www.freescale.com/webapp/sps/site/overview.jsp?nodeId=02Wcbf123F2D5D The TPM is designed to use as little power as possible to give maximum battery life. This is done by using very low power circuitry and transmitting the data as infrequently as possible and with as low power as possible. The UHF transmitter in a TPM typically transmits around 250ŒºW (1ŒºW is equal to one millionth (10‚àí6) of a watt). TPMs do not have UHF receivers built in due to the relatively high power requirements of this technology. This means that they can't tell that they are transmitting at the same time as another TPM. Most TPMs do have LF receivers as this uses little or no power. The pressure, temperature and acceleration sensors generate analog signals which are converted to their digital equivalents using analog to digital converters. The acceleration sensor measures the centrifugal force generated when the wheel rotates. This force is proportional to the rotational speed. The acceleration sensor may be a simple switch rather than an analog transducer (accelerometer). This is usually referred to as a roll switch. The acceleration sensor allows the TPM to be placed in a low-power communication device mode, when the vehicle is stationary which can extend the battery life. The advantage of a roll switch over an accelerometer is that the switch is purely mechanical and doesn't use any power to take a measurement. When the vehicle is stationary, the TPM may periodically transmit to the vehicle. This allows (as long as the vehicle receiver is always on) the driver or vehicle operator to be warned of low pressure as soon as the Ignition system is switched on rather than having to wait until the vehicle is moving. All TPM units on a vehicle operate on the same RF channel frequency and each message includes pressure data, temperature data, a unique ID code, operating state data, status information and check digits. The check digit is either a checksum or a cyclic redundancy check (CRC). The TPM does not usually have information about the tire's correct pressure as this would be very difficult and possibly dangerous to support. However it may have an algorithm contained within it which detects both slow and rapid changes in pressure. This condition may be transmitted as part of the TPM's status. It may also cause the TPM to transmit more frequently. Direct tire pressure monitoring systems There are two main types of direct tire pressure monitoring system currently in use. These are known as 'high line' and 'low line'.Hawes, p. 361. =High line system= If the vehicle is fitted with low frequency (LF) transmitters near each wheel, the vehicle may use these to force the sensors to transmit. In this case, the TPM may not transmit on its own, but the vehicle will periodically command the sensors to send their information.Hawes, p. 363. In addition, the TPMs will be forced to transmit when the ignition is switched on. This will give an early indication of low pressure without having to have the vehicle's receiver switched on when the vehicle is not in use. The transmitters are usually activated one at a time in sequence so that the vehicle can inform the driver of the location of the wheel with low pressure. This information can then be used later for localisation by matching the TPM's unique ID with its position discovered by this sequential activation. This method is used on some high line systems where the TPM also transmits periodically. On some vehicles only three LF transmitters are used in order to save money. The vehicle assumes that transmissions from a nearby TPM which has not been woken up by the LF belong to the TPM located where there is no LF transmitter. High line systems are inherently more expensive than low line systems but they have the advantage of the vehicle knowing the pressure when started without draining the vehicle's main battery and providing localisation. These systems tend to be used on higher end models. =Low line system= In this system, the TPM units transmit on their own at fixed or random intervals. As the individual TPMs on the vehicle do not know if another TPM is transmitting at the same time, it is possible to have collisions between messages transmitted. Measures have to be taken to ensure that the message is received by the vehicle. On some systems the message is re- transmitted multiple times to reduce the effect of interference (communication). The transmission pattern can be random or pseudo random to reduce the chance of collisions between transmissions from the sensors on the vehicle. Another method of attempting to avoid collisions is simply to transmit more frequently such as once per minute. In addition, if the TPM detects a rapid change in pressure or too high a temperature, it will start to transmit more frequently so that the vehicle has more chance of receiving the information. The low line system is used on the majority of vehicles due to its lower cost. Legal status =USA= The use of TPMS in vehicles in the USA was mandated in 2008 by the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation Act (or TREAD). This states that the driver of a vehicle must be warned of under inflation by 25%. The warning is displayed to the driver in line with 49 CFR Part 571 Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). The minimum requirement for the warning is in the form of a simple lit symbol on the dashboard, and this is often augmented by the display of a graphic of the car showing the wheel position to which the warning light corresponds. All new model year 2008 light vehicles shall have a TPMS (direct or indirect) fitted which is capable of detecting when one or more of the vehicle's tires, up to all four tires, is 25% or more below the manufacturer's recommended inflation pressure (placard pressure) or a minimum activation pressure specified in the standard, whichever is higher.http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/rulings/tirepresfinal/index.html =EU and Far East= European Union (EU) and Far East legislators looked at TPMS as a way of reducing CO2 emissions.http://www.iea.org/Textbase/work/2005/EnerEffTyre/stock.pdf From November 2014 (ECE-R 64 EU Directive), all new passenger cars models sold in the EU must be equipped with a TPMS.https://eur- lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:310:0018:0040:EN:PDF See also *Cold inflation pressure *Run-flat tire *Tire-pressure gauge *Car safety Notes Bibliography *.

Ideals The movement's program was based on Christian ethics and on papal encyclicals focused on social concerns whilst its political orientation was clerical-conservative. The movement's leaders included the Ukrainian political and cultural figure Oleksander Barvinsky, Anatole Vakhnianyn, and Kyryl Studynsky. The Christian Social Movement's support was based on Ukrainian moderates seeking rapprochement between Ukrainians and Poles.Encyclopedia of Ukraine, \\"Christian Social Movement\\" written by V. Markus Originally its principles included loyalty to Austria‚ÄìHungary and the Habsburg monarchy, the creation of a separate Ukrainian province, support for the Ukrainian language and expansion of Ukrainian schools, and opposition to Galician Russophiles. History Oleksander Barvinsky, founder of the Christian Social Party Its political party, founded in 1896, was originally named the Catholic Ruthenian People's Union. During this time, it was supported by Metropolitan Sembratovich, head of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, and by the Austrian government, which subsidized the newspaper Ruslan.Himka, John Paul. (1999). Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine. McGill-Queen's University Press: Montreal and Kingston. pg. 138 In 1911 the Catholic Ruthenian People's Union, under the leadership of Oleksander Barvinky, renamed itself as the Christian Social Party and sent representatives to the Austrian Parliament in Vienna as well as to the local Galician Diet. The Christian Social Party was more popular among Ukrainian civil servants than it was among the clergy, was uncritically loyal to the Habsburg monarchy, and did not enjoy widespread popularity among the Ukrainian population.Christoph Mick. 2016) Lemberg, Lwow, Lviv, 1914-1947: Violence and Ethnicity in a Contested City. West Lafayette, Indiana: Purdue University Press. pg. 95 After Austria-Hungary's collapse, the Christian Social Party subsequently participated in the formation of the West Ukrainian People's Republic. Following the Polish‚ÄìUkrainian War, after western Ukraine had passed under the control of the Second Polish Republic, the party continued to function until the 1930s. At that time, part of its members joined the Ukrainian National Democratic Alliance (UNDO) (a moderate political organization opposed to the radical Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists), while others founded the Ukrainian Catholic People's Party. The latter party advocated autonomy for western Ukraine but was loyal to the Polish state. It was able to place a member in the Polish parliament and Senate but was generally not very influential within Ukrainian society.Ukrainian Catholic People's party Entry in the Encyclopedia of Ukraine, published by the University of Toronto In the Second World War, western Ukraine was annexed by the Soviet Union and the Christian Social Movement ceased to exist there. Due to its strong ties to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the Christian Social Movement was criticized for its clericalism by both left-wing socialist groups as well as by right-wing nationalist groups in western Ukraine.

Mumbai grew into a leading commercial center of India during the 19th century on the basis of textile mills and overseas trade. After independence, the desire to domesticate a Marathi social and linguistic Mumbai to a cosmopolitan framework was strongly expressed in the 1950s. Mumbai, one of the earliest cities in India to be industrialized, emerged as the centre of strong organized labour movement in India, which inspired labour movements across India. Background Ships in Mumbai Harbour. Mumbai grew into a leading commercial center of India during the 19th century The Seven Islands that came to constitute Mumbai were home to communities of the Marathi Speaking Kolis and Aagris for Decades. The islands came under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese and subsequently to the British East India Company. During the mid-18th century, Mumbai was reshaped by the British with large-scale civil engineering projects, and emerged as a significant trading town. Mumbai was a native Fisherman Land of Marathi Speaking Kolis And Aagris grew into a leading commercial center of India during the 19th century on the basis of textile mills and overseas trade. The city was, first and foremost, built and developed by an Britishers Then Migrants From Gujarat Came For industrial and commercial bourgeoisie consisting of Parsis, Gujarati Hindus, Muslims communities earning their wealth on the extensive Arabian trade. The expanding labour force in Mumbai was initially drawn from the coastal belt of Konkan, south of the city. Until the 1940s, Marathi speakers from these areas accounted for 68% of the city's population, and held mostly jobs. Bombay State George Fernandes emerged as a key figure in the Bombay labour movement in the early 1950s After India's independence from British rule on 15 August 1947, the territory of Bombay Presidency retained by India after the partition was restructured into Bombay State. The area of Bombay State increased, after several erstwhile princely states that joined the Indian union were integrated into Bombay State. Subsequently, Bombay City, the capital of erstwhile Bombay Presidency, became the capital of Bombay State.* Following communal riots between Hindus and Muslims in the Sindh province of the newly created Pakistan from Bombay Presidency, over 100,000 Sindhi Hindu refugees from Pakistan were relocated in the military camps five kilometres from Kalyan in the Bombay metropolitan region. It was converted into a township in 1949, and named Ulhasnagar by the then Governor-General of India, C. Rajagopalachari. In 1947, Congress party activists established the Rashtriya Mazdoor Mill Sangh (RMMS), with a claimed membership of 32,000, to ensure a strong political base in the textile industry. The RMMS served as a lasting impediment to the free development of independent unionism in Bombay. Economic growth in India was relatively strong during much of the 1950s, and employment growth in Bombay was particularly good, as the city's manufacturing sector diversified. The Bombay textile industry until the 1950s was largely homogeneous, dominated by a relatively small number of large industrial mills. From the late 1950s, policies were introduced to curb the expansion of mills and to encourage increased production from the handloom and powerloom sectors, because of their employment generating capacities. Bombay was one of the few industrial centres of India where strong unions grew up, particularly company or enterprise based unions, often in foreign owned firms. A key figure in the Bombay labour movement in the early 1950s, was George Fernandes. He was a central figure in the unionisation of sections of Bombay labour in the 1950s. Bombay's Bollywood film industry grew rapidly as it received intense political attention and new sources of governmental funding after 1947. This enabled the industry to embark on technological innovations and to establish effective systems for nationwide distributions. The enormous growth in spectatorship and cinema halls throughout the country soon established Bombay cinema as the dominant Indian film industry. In April 1950, Greater Bombay District came into existence with the merger of Bombay Suburbs and Bombay City. It spanned an area of and inhabited 2,339,000 of people in 1951. The Municipal Corporation limits were extended up to Jogeshwari along the Western Railway and Bhandup along the Central Railway. This limit was further extended in February 1957 up to Dahisar along the Western Railway and Mulund on the Central Railway. The Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, one of the finest institutions in the country in science and technology, was established in 1958 at Powai, a northern suburb of Bombay, with assistance from UNESCO and with funds contributed by the Soviet Union. Battle of Mumbai Flora Fountain was renamed Hutatma Chowk (\\"Martyr's Square\\") as a memorial to the Samyukta Maharashtra movement. The Hutatma Chowk memorial with the Flora Fountain, on its left in the background The desire to domesticate a Marathi social and linguistic Mumbai to a cosmopolitan framework was strongly expressed in the 1950s. On 13 May 1946, a session of the Marathi literary conference held at Belgaum, unanimously resolved on the formation of a united Marathi state. Consequently, the Samyukta Maharashtra Parishad (United Maharashtra Conference) was formed on 28 September 1946, to unite all Marathi-speaking territories into a single political unit. The Parishad consisted of political leaders from the Congress and other parties, and prominent literary figures. It presented its point of view to the States Reorganisation Committee. However, the States Reorganisation Committee in its report to the Indian Government in 1955, recommended a bilingual state for Maharashtra‚ÄìGujarat with Mumbai as its capital. The Maharashtrians wanted Mumbai as a part of Maharashtra, since it had majority of Marathi speakers. However, the city's economic and political elite feared that Bombay would decline under a government committed to developing the rural hinterland. Mumbai Citizens' Committee, an advocacy group composed of leading Migrant Gujarati industrialists lobbied for Mumbai's independent status. In the Lok Sabha discussions on 15 November 1955, S. K. Patil a pro Gujarati lobby Political Leader, a Congress Member of Parliament (MP) from Mumbai, demanded that the city be constituted as an autonomous city-state, laying stress on his Anti Marathi character. On 20 November 1955, the Mumbai Pradesh Congress Committee organized a public meeting at the Chowpatty beach in Mumbai, where S. K. Patil and Morarji Desai, the then Chief Minister of Bombay State, made provocative statements on Mumbai. Patil said that, \\"Maharashtra will not get Bombay for the next 5,000 years.\\" On 21 November 1955, violent outbursts erupted, and there was a total hartal in Bombay. Thousands of angry protesters converged at Hutatma Chowk with a view to march peacefully towards the Council Hall, where the State Legislature was in session. The police used tear gas to disperse the crowd, but when it failed, they finally resorted to firing, killing 15 people. Under pressure from business interests in Mumbai it was decided to grant Mumbai the status of a Union territory under a centrally-governed administration, setting aside the recommendations of the States Reorganisation Committee report. On 16 January 1956, Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India, announced the government's decision to create separate states of Maharashtra and Gujarat, but put Mumbai City under central administration. Large demonstrations, mass meetings and riots soon followed. The Mumbai Police dissolved the mass meetings and arrested several of the movement's leaders. During 16 January-22 January, police fired at demonstrators protesting the arrests, in which more than 80 people were killed. The States Reorganisation Committee report was to be implemented on 1 November 1956. It caused a great political stir and, led to the establishment of the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti (United Maharashtra Committee) on 6 February 1956. The Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti was basically born from the Samyukta Maharashtra Parishad, but had an enlarged identity with broad representation from not only the Congress, but opposition parties, and independents as well. The Samiti spearheaded the demand for the creation of a separate Maharashtra state including Mumbai out of the bilingual Bombay State using violent means. In the August 1956 discussions, the Union cabinet agreed on the creation of a bigger bilingual Bombay State including Maharashtra, Marathwada, Vidharbha, Gujarat, Saurashtra, Kutch, and Mumbai City. In the second general elections of Bombay State held in 1957, the Samiti secured a majority of 101 seats out of 133 in the present day Western Maharashtra region. The Congress could secure only 32 seats out of 133 in Maharashtra, obtaining a bare majority of 13 out of 24 in Greater Mumbai The Congress suffered the same fate in Gujarat, winning only 57 out of 89 seats. The Congress however succeeded in forming a government in Bombay State with the support of Marathwada and Vidarbha. Yashwantrao Chavan became the first Chief Minister of the Maharashtra State. In 1959, he headed a cabinet of 15, out of which 4 represented Gujarat, to discuss the future of Bombay State. Chavan managed in convincing Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi, who was elected President of the Indian National Congress in 1959, of the futility of the bilingual Bombay State, which was increasingly jeopardizing Congress prospects in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Finally on 4 December 1959, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) passed a resolution recommending the bifurcation of the Bombay State. The Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti achieved its goal when Bombay State was reorganised on linguistic lines on 1 May 1960. Retrieved on 12 November 2008. Gujarati-speaking areas of Bombay State were partitioned into the state of Gujarat. Maharashtra State with Mumbai as its capital was formed with the merger of Marathi-speaking areas of Bombay State, eight districts from Central Provinces and Berar, five districts from Hyderabad State, and numerous princely states enclosed between them. In all 105 persons died in the battle for Mumbai. As a memorial to the martyrs of the Samyukta Maharashtra movement, as Hutatma Chowk (Martyr's Square), and a memorial was erected, since it was the starting point of the agitation. After the 1960 bifurcation, many Gujaratis left Mumbai feeling that they would be better-off in Gujarat than in Mumbai, and fearing that they would be neglected by the Maharashtra Government. The Maharashtrians also blamed the Gujaratis for the death of the 105 martyrs of the Samyukta Maharashtra movement. Rise of Regionalism Bal Thackeray had established the Shiv Sena party in 1966 In the 1960s,the Marathi-speaking middle-class in Mumbai, who had been the most consistent supporters of the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti,felt threatened in Mumbai despite the creation of Maharashtra. This was mainly because of the increasing number of migrants competing with them for jobs. The Gujarati and Marwari communities owned majority of the industry and trade enterprises in the city, while the white-collar jobs were mainly sought by the South Indian migrants to the city. This was the line taken by Mumbai cartoonist and journalist Bal Thackeray in his weekly magazine Marmik (Satire), launched in 1963, which soon became one of the most popular magazines among Native Marathi speakers of Mumbai. Backed by his father Prabodhankar Thackeray and a circle of friends, he established the Shiv Sena party on 19 June 1966, out of a feeling of resentment about the relative marginalization of Maharashtrians in Mumbai. The Shiv Sena rallied against the South Indians, the Communists, the Gujarati city elite, and the Muslims in India. In the 1960s and 1970s, Shiv Sena cadres became involved in various attacks against the South Indian communities, vandalising South Indian restaurants and pressuring employers to hire Marathis. The creation of Navi Mumbai Navi Mumbai, the twin city of Navi Mumbai, was founded in 1979, to help the dispersal and control of Bombay's population The need for urban development on the mainland across from Mumbai Island was first officially recommended in the 1940s. In 1945, a Post-war development committee suggested that areas should be developed on the mainland on the opposite side of the harbour to contain the future growth of the city. In 1947, N. V. Modak and Albert Mayer published their plan, stressing on controlled development of the city, suburbs, and its satellite towns like Thane, Vasai, and Uran. In March 1964, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai submitted its development plan for Greater Mumbai, which was criticized for various reasons, but approved in 1967. By that time, another plan had been developed by two of Mumbai's leading architects Charles Correa and Pravin Mehta, and an engineer Shirish Patel. They suggested that a \\"twin city\\" of equal size and prominence to Greater Mumbai, would only be able to solve the city's congestion problems. Thus, the idea of the creation of Navi Mumbai was born. The proposed site for Navi Mumbai covered an area of , integrating 95 villages spread over the districts of Thane and Raigad. 21st century One of the bomb-damaged coaches at the Mahim station in Mumbai during the 11 July 2006 train bombings During the 21st century, the city suffered several bombings.

The damaged Oberoi Trident hotel during the November 2008 attacks Mumbai was lashed by torrential rains on 26‚Äì27 July 2005, during which the city was brought to a complete standstill. The city received 37 inches (940 millimeters) of rain in 24 hours ‚Äî the most any Indian city has ever received in a single day. Around 83 people were killed.

He became the Federal Communications Commission Chairman on June 29, 2009. On March 22, 2013, he announced he would be leaving the FCC in the coming weeks. On January 6, 2014, it was announced that Genachowski had joined The Carlyle Group. Early life and education Genachowski was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, and grew up in Great Neck, New York, the son of Adele and Azriel Genachowski. He attended yeshiva and studied in Israel. He entered Columbia College of Columbia University as a pre-med student, but earned a Bachelor of Arts in History (1985) magna cum laude. He was an Editor of the Columbia Daily Spectator. After working in Washington, D.C., for former New York Congressman Chuck Schumer, he entered Harvard Law School and earned a Juris Doctor (1991), also magna cum laude. He was a Notes Editor at the Harvard Law Review when his classmate Barack Obama was its president. Genachowski clerked for The Honorable Abner J. Mikva on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and then for Justices William J. Brennan and David Souter at the U.S. Supreme Court. Government and business experience Genachowski was on the staffs of the Select Committee investigating the Iran- Contra Affair and then U.S. Representative Chuck Schumer.Rock Creek Ventures - Julius Genachowski In 1994 FCC Chairman Reed Hundt hired him as a senior legal advisor; he was chief counsel 1996-1997. He was Chief of Business Operations and a member of Barry Diller's Office of the Chairperson at IAC/InterActiveCorp and executive responsible for the creation of Fox Broadcasting Company and USA Broadcasting. He earned at least $2.5 million when Vivendi acquired Universal assets in 2003. He had previously served on the Boards of Directors of Expedia, Hotels.com, and Ticketmaster. Genachowski was a co-founder of LaunchBox Digital and Rock Creek Ventures; a Special Advisor at General Atlantic; and a member of the Boards of Directors at The Motley Fool, Web.com, Mark Ecko Enterprises, and Beliefnet. In April 2006, he was appointed to the Board of JackBe. He served on the Board of Common Sense Media, a leading organization seeking to improve the media lives of children and families and the Advisory Board of Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2). He also helped found the New Resource Bank, the country's first commercial green bank. On January 6, 2014, it was announced that Genachowski returned to the corporate world to take a post at The Carlyle Group. There he will reportedly concentrate on global technology, media, and telecommunications investments. Obama campaign and transition For Senator Barack Obama's 2008 Presidential Campaign, Genachowski was Chairperson of the Technology, Media and Telecommunications Policy Working Group, which created the Obama Technology and Innovation Plan. He also advised and guided the Campaign's innovative use of technology and the Internet for grassroots engagement and participation. After the November election, he co-led the Technology, Innovation, and Government Reform Group for President-Elect Obama's Transition Team. On January 12, 2009, several news outlets reported that Genachowski would be President-Elect Obama's choice to head the FCC. This was confirmed by a press release on March 3, 2009. Tenure as FCC Chairman On June 25, 2009, the U.S. Senate unanimously confirmed Julius Genachowski as FCC Chairman. Wired named \\"A New FCC\\" one of the \\"Top 7 Disruptions of the Year\\" after Genachowski announced plans to create the country's first national broadband plan, reallocate spectrum from over-the-air TV broadcasters to meet demand for wireless usage, and pursue rules to preserve Internet freedom and openness. According to an opinion piece by Genachowski, wireless providers increased wireless infrastructure investment more than 60% between 2009 and 2013 and the United States led the world in the deployment and adoption of 4G/LTE mobile broadband. A study by the ITIF made similar assertions. However, numerous press outlets subsequently questioned the findings. Businessweek called the U.S. a \\"wireless backwater\\" prior to 2008, while Genachowski praised the mobile industry for \\"America's leadership in mobile\\" in 2009. In terms of wired broadband, the Genachowski FCC reported that networks capable of 100 megabits per second passed less than 20% of U.S. homes in 2009 and over 80% in 2012, putting the U.S. near the top of the world in deployment of broadband infrastructure. This followed announcements of upgrade plans by cable operators in 2008. According to an opinion piece by Genachowski, American firms installed more fiber optic cable for high-speed broadband in 2011 and 2012 than those of any nation other than China, and more than all European nations combined. Genachowski announced his resignation on March 22, 2013. He will join the Aspen Institute as a senior fellow. In addition, he announced in January, 2014 that, upon leaving the FCC, he would begin work for the Carlyle Group. =National Broadband Plan= On March 16, 2010, Genachowski released a National Broadband Plan, titled \\"Connecting America: The National Broadband Plan\\". The plan lays out a vision for a U.S. strategic advantage in broadband. It includes more than 200 recommendations, including proposals to reallocate airwaves for mobile broadband and to modernize the FCC's $9 billion per year Universal Service Fund from a program that supports phone service to a program that efficiently supports broadband. Proponents had argued that lack of a national plan put the United States at a competitive disadvantage compared to nations with developed broadband plans. The plan was released to generally positive reviews from public interest and business leaders. Some public interest advocates expressed concern that the plan did not propose to foster more competition in a broadband market. For example, the broadband plan found there to be \\"reasons to be concerned about wireline broadband competition in the United States.\\" President Obama commended the plan, and the Obama administration endorsed the spectrum goal in a speech by National Economic Council Director Lawrence Summers. At the end of Genachowski's tenure, 87 percent of the action agenda had been acted upon. Additional agenda items were never provided. =Connect America Fund= Under Genachowski, the FCC overhauled the $9 billion per year Universal Service Fund (USF) into a program that supports universal broadband service rather than phone service. The new Connect America Fund was approved unanimously by the FCC in October 2011 and launched in April 2012, and maintains the same annual budget as USF. The FCC projects the Connect America Fund will help connect over 19 million Americans to broadband, mostly in rural areas. In July 2012, the FCC announced the first phase of the program which, over three years, pairs $115 million in public funds with private investment to bring high-speed Internet to 400,000 residents and businesses that lack access. As part of the reforms, the FCC identified mobile broadband as a Universal Service goal for the first time. The Connect America Fund includes a Mobility Fund specifically to bring 3G and 4G wireless broadband to unserved areas. =Spectrum crunch= Genachowski has warned of a \\"spectrum crunch\\" of public airwaves, in which demand for mobile broadband service outstrips the availability of spectrum. Numerous experts have disputed claims that a \\"spectrum crunch\\" exists. Genachowski and his team have pushed for incentive auctions of broadcast television spectrum‚Äîa proposal in the National Broadband Plan to allow spectrum license-holders to supply spectrum for auction and receive a share of the proceeds. The plan received criticism from some television broadcasters, who said it favored mobile broadband deployment goals over their industry. The auctions gained bipartisan support from U.S. lawmakers and praise from wireless and tech companies as a way to promote investment in wireless networks and drive further innovation. Incentive auctions were passed by U.S. Congress and adopted into law as part of the deal to extend the payroll tax cut. Genachowski announced the process would be advised by a team of auction economics experts, led by economist Paul Milgrom. Genachowski has pushed for spectrum sharing between current government and commercial wireless users in order to improve network capacity. He has also advocated for the preservation and use of unlicensed spectrum bands as platforms for innovation, citing the success of Wi‚ÄëFi, which uses unlicensed spectrum. The FCC has set aside spectrum for unlicensed use. In February 2013, the FCC voted unanimously on a Genachowski proposal to free up wireless spectrum that will increase Wi-Fi speeds and ease network congestion in homes and at major hubs, like conferences, airports, hotels etc. It is the largest block of unlicensed spectrum made available for Wi-Fi in over a decade, and adds an additional 195 MHz of spectrum in the 5 GHz band. NPR's Marketplace called the vote a \\"rare moment of unanimity in Washington.\\" =Mergers and acquisitions= Under Genachowski, the FCC approved the Comcast NBC merger in January 2011. The FCC and Department of Justice applied a number of public interest conditions to promote online competition in the video marketplace. Unfortunately, according to the FCC, the price of multichannel video has continued to rise. In June 2012, Comcast agreed to pay an $800,000 settlement for allegedly violating their agreement with the FCC to market an affordable, standalone broadband deal that was not tied to cable television plans. In November 2011, following an August 2011 announcement by the Department of Justice that the merger would be opposed, the FCC moved to block AT&T;'s proposed $39 billion bid for rival T-Mobile. The merger would have combined the second and fourth-largest cellphone carriers in the country, resulting in the largest concentration in U.S. wireless market in history.[47] AT&T; withdrew their application days later. AT&T; competitors have sought to improve their market position with a proposed merger between T-Mobile/MetroPCS and a major investment in Sprint Nextel by Japan's Softbank. =Consumer empowerment and protection= Connect2Compete Genachowski announced the launch of Connect2Compete in 2011, an initiative to help close the digital divide by expanding broadband and computer access to low-income households. Connect2Compete offers under $10 per month broadband access and under $150 laptops to households with a child enrolled in the national school lunch program. It is a partnership with Internet service providers, technology companies, and nonprofits, run outside government and funded by in-kind commitments. In May 2012, Connect2Compete launched a pilot program to expand access in San Diego. It reports billions of dollars in commitments and plans to launch in all 50 states. Gigabit City Challenge In January 2013, Genachowski launched a \\"Gigabit City Challenge\\" to engage with broadband providers and state and local leaders to ensure ultrafast gigabit Internet is available in at least one community in all fifty states by 2015. As part of the initiative, Genachowski announced plans to hold workshops and create best practices resources to help reach the goal. Combating bill shock In 2011 the FCC and wireless carriers reached an agreement to combat bill shock when consumers receive unexpected overage charges. Smartphone and tablet wireless data users now receive alerts when they near an overage charge. Leading Education by Advancing Digital (LEAD) Genachowski launched an effort with U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to encourage the spread of digital textbooks and create a blueprint on how to harness technology for education reform. In 2012 the FCC and Department of Education joined with technology and education leaders to form the Leading Education by Advancing Digital (LEAD) Commission to analyze trends and present policy and funding recommendations. LEAD is co-chaired by Columbia University President Lee Bollinger, TPG Capital co‚Äëfounder James Coulter, former Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings and Common Sense Media founder and CEO Jim Steyer. Data roaming Genachowski led a successful effort to pass data roaming rules so consumers have access to wireless Internet even in areas their provider does not cover. The rules passed on a 3‚Äë2 vote in April 2011. The rules require Verizon and AT&T; to enter into roaming agreements with smaller carriers in order to preserve industry competition. Health Care Genachowski launched a Healthcare Connect Fund in 2012 to expand access to broadband for health care. The fund is capped at $400 million and will help bring modern, cost-saving telehealth technology to rural hospitals and clinics. Genachowski also led an effort to provide spectrum for wireless medical technology‚Äîcalled Medical Area Body Networks (mBANs)‚Äîthat monitor patients' vital signs to improve outcomes and lower costs. Public files of TV stations The FCC also passed a rule to require local television stations to put their public files online. The rule modernized the existing agency rule that requires public files available at television stations in physical filing cabinets. The rule was proposed in an FCC report \\"The Information Needs of Communities\\", commissioned by Genachowski and authored by Steve Waldman in 2011. Since 1938, broadcasters have been required to make a file available to the public containing information on station advertising and other topics. The new rule was passed in April 2012, and initially ABC, NBC, Fox, and CBS stations in the top 50 markets will have to put their file online‚Äîin 2014, all TV stations will be required to comply. Broadcasters resisted the requirement and claimed that administrative costs would be high. Public interest groups and editorial boards such as Bloomberg News endorsed the rule. Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA) In January 2012, the FCC released a report and order on implementation of the Twenty-First Century Communications and Video Accessibility Act (CVAA), which updates federal law to increase the access of persons with disabilities to modern communications. Among the reforms was a rule moving Internet video previously shown on television to closed captioning. =Net neutrality= While chief technology advisor to President-Elect Obama, Genachowski was a strong advocate of a net neutrality principle. Net neutrality principles were first articulated at the FCC by Republican Chairmen Michael Powell and Kevin Martin, and were endorsed in a unanimous FCC policy statement in 2005. Support for codifying net neutrality came from public interest groups, venture capitalists, wireless carriers such as Sprint and Clearwire, and a coalition including Google, Amazon, Twitter and others. Support for the net neutrality principle was also a campaign promise of Barack Obama. Opposition largely came from dominant Internet service providers. In May 2010, the FCC proposed an Open Internet Order with net neutrality rules that required wireline Internet service providers to not block websites or impose certain limits on users; wireless providers were given greater freedom to interfere with consumer's Internet access. In December 2010, the FCC passed a final version on a 3-2 vote. President Obama issued a statement of support, and later threatened to veto any House legislation to repeal the rules. Support also came from a number of business and technology leaders and public interest groups. AT&T; CEO Randall Stephenson backed the rules as a way to eliminate regulatory uncertainty. The rules received criticism from Verizon, which argued they exceed the FCC's authority, and from some public interest groups such as Free Press, which argued the rules were too narrow and should be expanded. Verizon Wireless and Free Press sued the FCC, although Free Press dropped its lawsuit. In 2012, Genachowski appointed Harvard law professor Jonathan Zittrain to chair an FCC Open Internet Advisory Committee created to evaluate the effectiveness of the neutrality rules. The group is made up of representatives from Mozilla, Netflix, the Center for Democracy and Technology, AT&T;, Internet Society, Comcast, Disney, and others. As of April 2013, no evaluation has been provided to the public. In July 2012, during the FCC review of Verizon Wireless' purchase of spectrum held by cable operators, the FCC settled an investigation into Verizon Wireless over violation of open Internet rules on its 700 MHz spectrum. The FCC found the Verizon had asked Google to remove applications from the Android marketplace that allow \\"tethering\\" to turn smartphones into Wi-Fi hotspots. Verizon had typically charged a \\"tethering fee\\" of $20 for their service. As part of the settlement, Verizon agreed to pay $1.25 million to the U.S. Treasury. =International= Genachowski has promoted an international Multistakeholder Model of Internet governance to protect Internet freedom and warned against proposed new regulations by the International Telecommunications Union, an arm of the UN, that could result in a more government-oriented, top-down model of internet governance. In November 2012, Genachowski and Hector Olavarria Tapia, Mexico's Secretariat of Communications and Transport, signed an initiative to combat theft of mobile devices and their sale across the border. Under the program, wireless carriers will build and maintain an international database to prevent stolen devices from being reactivated in Mexico or the United States. Earlier in the year, major U.S. carriers signed an agreement with the FCC to begin disabling stolen devices within the United States. =Public Safety Initiatives= Genachowski and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg unveiled the nation's first comprehensive emergency notification system for cellphones at Ground Zero in May 2011. The Personal Localized Alerting Network (PLAN) is a free service to send emergency text alerts to citizens in an area with \\"imminent threats to safety.\\" It is a partnership between the FCC, FEMA, New York City, and wireless carriers. Genachowski has also announced a plan to create a \\"Next Generation 911\\" emergency response system that will enable text, video, and photo messages and automatic location information to be sent to 911. In response to a nationwide rise in smartphone theft and related assaults, Genachowski, major city police chiefs, and wireless providers launched a national database to track stolen smartphones. The initiative will allow users to disable use of their device once reported stolen, lowering the black market value. From mid-2011 to mid-2012, roughly one in three robberies nationwide involved theft of a cellphone, according to the FCC. The four largest wireless carriers are expected to put databases in place by 2013, and complete a merged database in 2014. Genachowski has campaigned against \\"distracted driving\\", or the use of mobile devices or texting applications while driving. In 2009, Genachowski and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood launched a campaign to reform laws and change social norms. He has advocated in the media and testified before the Senate, and spurred awareness campaigns such as AT&T;'s \\"It Can't Wait\\" initiative. Over 100,000 car crashes each year involve texting, according to the National Safety Council. Personal life His parents are Eastern European Jews who survived the Holocaust. His cousin, Menachem Genack, is an Orthodox rabbi and the CEO of the Orthodox Union Kosher Division. He was previously married to Rachel Goslins and to journalist Martha Raddatz. Genachowski was named by President Barack Obama to lead the United States delegation for the commemoration of the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.

Kingdom of Italy established formal bilateral relations with the Principality of Serbia on 18 January 1879. The strategic partnership between the Republic of Serbia and the Republic of Italy was established in Rome on 13 November 2009. Italy is one of the member states of the European Union which strongly support Accession of Serbia to the European Union. Both countries are members of the Central European Initiative. History =Before the establishment of the formal bilateral relations= Saint Spyridon Church, Trieste Economic, social and political interactions between Italian Peninsula and Balkan Peninsula are of historical longue dur√©e and were intensive ever since the Roman Empire conquered of the region. Grand Prince of Serbia Stefan the First- Crowned (1165‚Äì1228) coronation was performed by a legate of Pope Urban II which led some Serbian historians to conclude that Stefan underwent both Catholic and Orthodox coronations, but modern scholars tend to agree that only the papal one took place. Stefan's third wife, Venetian noblewoman Anna Dandolo, became Queen of Serbia and was mother to Stefan Uro≈° I. Popular legend claims that the ≈Ωiƒça Monastery, seat of the Serbian Orthodox Church between 1219‚Äì1253, was intentionally constructed on the half way between Rome and Constantinople. =Relations up until the creation of Kingdom of Yugoslavia= Kingdom of Italy established formal bilateral relations with the Principality of Serbia on 18 January 1879. =Yugoslav period= =Breakup of Yugoslavia= A US F-117 Nighthawk before taking off from Aviano Air Base, Italy, in March 1999 as part of NATO operations against Yugoslavia In the initial phase of the Breakup of Yugoslavia Members of the European Economic Community were divided over the importance they should give to the potentially contradictory principles of self-determination and territorial integrity. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl strongly stressing the right to self- determination, French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand arguing against immediate cutoff of aid to Yugoslavia, while Spain, Italy and United Kingdom insisted on the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia. In the period following the breakup of Yugoslavia Italy perceived Belgrade as an ally for diplomatic leverage on newly independent Croatia and Slovenia in advocating rights of Istrian Italians and recognition of Istrian-Dalmatian exodus while in addition Italian left showed sympathy towards the country under international sanctions. Staff size at the Italian Embassy in Belgrade barely changed between years 1990 and 2010. Relations between Italy and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia- Montenegro) under Slobodan Milosevic's rule were cold but nevertheless continued. The Italian government bought shares in Telekom Serbia, but also took part in the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia when the NATO-member states used the Aviano Air Base in Italy from where military aeroplanes dropped bombs onto Yugoslavia. Italian participation was perceived as an major rapture in relations, yet Rome decided to participate in NATO bombing as it enabled Italy to get a primary role in the aftermath of the war. 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia was the first NATO intervention led by Italian officials and the country was the second largest contributing state of the NATO Kosovo Force. This offered an opportunity for Italy to regain a more central role in Mediterranean diplomacy which particularly materialized in UNIFIL Lebanon. Italy and Serbia quickly normalized relations after the overthrow of Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá and Rome becoming one of the first supporters of Serbia‚Äôs European integrations. =Relations since 2006= On 21 February 2008 Italy recognized unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo which in previous days was recognized by France, United Kingdom, United States and Germany as well. This was perceived as a second major blow to the relations after 1999 intervention and Serbia recalled its ambassador for a couple of months but subsequently normalized relations. Former Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and at the time High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Federica Mogherini facilitated Belgrade‚ÄìPristina negotiations. In an effort to reach final comprehensive agreement between two sides Mogherini was open to the idea of Partition of Kosovo but the agreement was not reached due to Kosovo's announcement of a 10% and subsequently 100% tariffs on goods imported from Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 2016 Italy was represented in Belgrade with 25 diplomats, just behind Russia (54), United States (40), China (37), Germany (33) and Libya (27) but more than Austria, France, Turkey, Hungary, United Kingdom or Serbian diplomatic allies in Europe such as Greece and Spain. Comparatively high Italian presence was explained with growing economic ties, unusually high Libyan diplomatic presence, Serbia's role in Western Balkans and Italian leading role in developing the best possible NATO‚ÄìSerbia relations short of membership. On April 25 Serbia sent 8 planes with medical aid to Italy, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Serbia sent 2 million epidemiological masks, 2 million surgical masks 1 million gloves, 100 thousand suits.

Relations continued with the successor Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The Portuguese recognized the government in exile of this state after the German occupation of 1941. Relations with the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which took power in 1945 after World War II, were only established in 1974 after the Portuguese Carnation Revolution.

The road is designated as County Route 84 (CR 84) from NY 28N in Newcomb to Interstate 87 (I-87) in North Hudson, and as New York State Route 910K (NY 910K) between I-87 and U.S. Route 9 (US 9) in North Hudson. The CR 84 portion is an , two-lane stretch of rural highway maintained by the Essex County Department of Public Works' Highway Division while NY 910K is a highway maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). All of Blue Ridge Road has been designated as the \\"Blue Ridge Road Scenic Byway\\" by NYSDOT. Blue Ridge Road was designated as part of NY 73 in the 1930 renumbering of state routes in New York. NY 73 was truncated to Schroon in the mid-1930s. Route description Blue Ridge Road consists of Essex County's CR 84, which composes the bulk of the route, and NY 910K, which is a short, state-maintained roadway connecting I-87 to US 9\\\\. The entirety of Blue Ridge Road is designated as the \\"Blue Ridge Road Scenic Byway\\", a New York State Scenic Byway, by NYSDOT. =County Route 84= Blue Ridge Road begins at an intersection with NY 28N and CR 75 (Eaton Lane) in the area south of Tahawus (pronounced \\"ta-hawz\\"). The road heads to the northeast, initially paralleling the Hudson River, then intersects with CR 25 (Tahawus Road), which heads north to the hamlet of Tahawus. After that, the route diverges from the Hudson River, turning to the southeast and climbing slightly to the side of Pine Hill, before progressing downhill. At the base of the mountain, CR 84 crosses over Vanderwhacker Brook, which flows into nearby Vanderwhacker Pond. The road winds its way around several different mountain peaks, passing to the north of Cheney Pond. After passing through the hamlet of Boreas River, CR 84 briefly follows Wolf Pond Brook, which eventually turns north for nearby Wolf Pond. The road continues eastward past Sand Pond and begins to descend, roughly following Sand Pond Brook. It passes along the base of Ragged Mountain, a peak in the Adirondacks, after which the road runs along the edge of the valley of the stream known as \\"The Branch.\\" At the base of Three Brothers Mountain, CR 84 curves northeast before making a turn to the southeast, soon entering the hamlet of Blue Ridge. With The Branch still paralleling to the south, CR 84 continues its eastward descent and eventually intersects with its first road in several miles, Lazy Street, which provides access to the creek. At the base of Nippletop Mountain, Blue Ridge Road passes along the north shore of Palmer Pond, a small pond visible from the Adirondack Northway (I-87). Soon after, Blue Ridge Road intersects with the ramps leading to and from the Northway and the county-maintained portion of Blue Ridge Road ends. =NY 910K= The eastern end of Blue Ridge Road, beginning at the ramps to and from the Adirondack Northway, is maintained by NYSDOT as NY 910K. The route heads eastward from the Northway ramps to nearby US 9\\\\. On this stretch, there is one intermediate intersection, this being with an unnamed roadway. The route ends at US 9 in the hamlet of North Hudson. History The entirety of Blue Ridge Road was designated as the westernmost portion of NY 73 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. NY 73 initially ran from NY 28N east to an intersection with US 9 in North Hudson, where NY 73 turned south to follow US 9 toward Schroon. The route was truncated to begin at US 9 in Schroon. NY 73's former alignment along Blue Ridge Road was redesignated as CR 2B by 1969. The section between the Northway and US 9 was later transferred to the state and assigned the NY 910K designation. On May 21, 2009, New York Governor David Paterson announced that stimulus money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act would be used to reconstruct the CR 84 segment of the Blue Ridge Road, seeing it as a major connector from NY 28N to I-87.

He was resident in England from 1536 to 1540, and in 1542 was appointed professor of theology at Marburg.Heinrich F. Plett, Rhetoric and Renaissance Culture (2004), p. 27. Work Hyperius's theology lies between Lutheran and Reformed beliefs. Influenced by Martin Bucer, he was not a strict Lutheran. Jean Calvin endorsed his erudition.Christopher Mattinson Dent, Protestant Reformers in Elizabethan Oxford (1983), p. 90. His work De formandis concionibus sacris (On the Making of Sacred Discourses) was the first Protestant text solely devoted to systematic homiletics, that is, to preaching considered as a branch of rhetoric.Larissa Taylor, Preachers and People in the Reformations and Early Modern Period (2001), p. 51.

In his overall approach, Hyperius sought a firm basis in the Bible, rigidly, and held that before practical theology can be put in force, it must be made a part of systematic theological study, and must not be taught fragmentarily. Demanding an immense amount of preliminary reading on the part of the student, covering all practical theology except missions, he held that such reading would involve preparation for the practical work of the ministry. All must be squared with the Bible, or, where the Bible did not contain specific data, with the commandments of love for God and one's neighbor. In addition, he urged the preparation of a work on church government, including the data of the New Testament, relevant portions of church history, excerpts from the councils, papal decrees, Church Fathers, and works on dogmatics, liturgics, and related materials. His English translator, John Ludham (vicar of Wethersfield, Essex, 1570-1613),A. Hessayon and N. Keene, Scripture and Scholarship in Early Modern England (Ashgate Publishing, 2006), p. 63. published the De formandis as The Practise of Preaching, otherwise called the Pathway to the Pulpet (London 1577).Andreas Hyperius, The practise of preaching, otherwise called the Pathway to the pulpet: conteyning an excellent method how to frame divine sermons, & to interpret the holy Scriptures according to the capacitie of the vulgar people. First written in Latin by the learned pastor of Christes Church, D. Andreas Hyperius: and now lately (to the profit of the same Church) Englished by Iohn Ludham, vicar of Wethersfeld (Thomas East, London 1577). Ludham went on to translate Hyperius's posthumously published De Sacrae Scripturae lectione ac meditatione quotidiana (Basle, 1569) as The Course of Christianity: or, as touching the dayly reading and meditation of the holy Scriptures (London 1579):Andreas Hyperius, The course of Christianitie: or, As touching the dayly reading and meditation of the holy Scriptures: very requisite and necessary for all Christians of what estate or condition soeuer: two bookes. Translated out of Latine into English, by Iohn Ludham vicar of Wethersfeld (Henry Bynneman, London 1579). he then turned to the homilies of Rudolf Gwalther on the prophet Joel (London 1582)Rudolf Gwalther, The homilies or familiar sermons of M. Rodolph Gualther Tigurine vpon the prophet Ioel. Translated from Latine into Englishe, by Iohn Ludham vicar of Withersfielde (Thomas Dawson for William Ponsonnby, London 1582). before returning to Hyperius for A Speciall Treatise of Gods Providence (c. 1588), which included an exposition upon Psalm 107. To this was added an appendix of the Cambridge sermons and disquisitions of Peter Baro.Andreas Gerardus, Hyperius, A speciall Treatise of Gods Providence, and of comforts against all kinde of crosses & calamities to be fetched from the same. With an exposition of the 107 Psalme. Heerunto is added an appendix of certaine Sermons & Questions‚Ä¶ as they were uttered and disputed ad Clerum in Cambridge. By P. Baro‚Ä¶ Englished by I.

Related elements include stakeholder analysis, context analysis, and scenarios,Alexander and Beus-Dukic, 2009. Pages 17-18 among other business and technical areas. Principles Goals are objectives which a system should achieve through cooperation of actors in the intended software and in the environment. Goal modeling is especially useful in the early phases of a project. Projects may consider how the intended system meets organizational goals (see also ), why the system is needed and how the stakeholders‚Äô interests may be addressed.E. Yu, \\"Towards Modelling and Reasoning Support for Early-Phase Requirements Engineering\\", 1997 IEEE A goal model: * Expresses the relationships between a system and its environment (i.e. not only on what the system is supposed to do, but why). The understanding this gives, of the reasons why a system is needed, in its context, is useful because \\"systems are increasingly used to fundamentally change business processes rather than to automate long-established practices\\".K.Pohl and P. Haumer, \\"Modelling Contextual Information about Scenarios\\", Proc. 3rd Int. Workshop on Requirements Engineering: Foundations of Software Quality REFSQ ‚Äô97, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, June 1997 pp. 187-204. * Clarifies requirements : Specifying goals leads to asking \\"why\\", \\"how\\" and \\"how else\\". Stakeholders' requirements are often revealed in this process, with less risk of either missing requirements, or of over-specifying (asking for things that are not needed). * Allows large goals to be analyzed into small, realizable goals: * Deals with conflicts : goal modeling can identify and help to resolve tradeoffs between cost, performance, flexibility, security and other goals. It can reveal divergent interests between stakeholders. It can identify conflicts because meeting one goal can interfere with meeting other goals. * Enables requirement completeness to be measured: requirements can be considered complete if they fulfil all the goals in the goal model. * Connects requirements to design: for example, the i* \\"Non- Functional Requirements (NFR) framework\\" uses goals to guide the design process. Notations There are several notations in use for goal models in software development, including: * i* (pronounced \\"eye-star\\") and a variant, GRLYu et al, 2011. * KAOS van Lamsweerde, 2009. * UML Use Case diagramFowler, 2004. Pages 99-105 Other notations have been proposed by researchers, while the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) and GRL are sometimes used to make safety cases to satisfy the regulator in safety-related industries.GSN Community Standard =Goal modeling in i*= The i* goal modeling notation provides two kinds of diagram: * \\"Strategic Dependency\\" (SD), defining relationships between roles in terms of specific goals that one role depends on the other role to provide. * \\"Strategic Rationale\\" (SR), analyzing the goals identified on the SD model into subsidiary goals and tasks. i* shows each role (an actor, agent or position) as a large circle containing the goals, tasks, and resources which that role owns. Ownership in i* means that the role desires the satisfaction of its goals, either for its own benefit or for the benefit of some other role. Goals may be accompanied by \\"obstacles\\" (negative goals) to be surmounted. Non-functional goals can be modeled as \\"soft goals\\" in i*: they are diagrammed as clouds or indented ovals. =Goal modeling in KAOS= The KAOS goal modeling notation provides a way of defining goals and obstacles, underpinned by a formal (mathematical) method of analysis. =Goal modeling in UML= UML's use case diagram provides a simple goal modeling notation. The bubbles name functional goals,Alexander and Beus-Dukic, 2009. Page 121 so a Use case diagram forms a simple functions-only goal model: as Cockburn writes, use cases cover only the behavioral requirements.Cockburn, 2001. Page 62 Roles are shown as actors (stickmen on the diagram), linked to the use cases in which they take part. The use cases are drawn as elliptical bubbles, representing desired behavioral goals.Cockburn, 2001. Page 221 With the addition of misuse cases, the notation can model both desired goals and active threats. The misuse case notation shows negative (possibly hostile) stakeholders as the primary actors for the misuse cases; these may be grouped on the right-hand side of the diagram. The notation may assist in discovering suitable mitigating or preventative goals, shown as subsidiary use cases. These often have the aim of improving security, safety, or reliability, which are non-functional goals. Non-functional requirements can to some extent be described in use case style using misuse cases to define negative goals; but the (positive) goals thus discovered are often functional. For example, if theft is a threat to security, then fitting locks is a mitigation; but that a door can be locked is a functional requirement.Alexander and Maiden, 2004. Chapter 7. Pages 119-139. The counter point is that Use Cases are not from Cognitive Science roots, whereas i* and KAOS are. Indeed, the literature behind Use Cases does not include discussion Goal Intention, Goal Refinement, Ends-Means, does not call out Rasmussen et cetera. There may be a predilection to relate Use Cases to Goals because of the visual metaphor of Goals rather than the semantics of Goal Refinement per Cognitive Science.

Formerly a senior fellow, running the Europe programme, at Chatham House (The Royal Institute of International Affairs) in London, he has also held fellowships with a number of leading think tanks in the United States and Europe including the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the German Marshall Fund of the United States. He is vice president of the Halifax International Security Forum, Shepherd began his working life as a journalist, in which capacity he worked for Reuters and The Times. Early life and education Born in Ilkley, West Yorkshire, Shepherd attended Ilkley Grammar School, a state school in the north of England. He studied Russian at the School of Slavonic and East European Studies - which today forms part of University College London - and gained a master's degree in political theory from the London School of Economics. Career The early focus of his work was post-Communist transition in Eastern Europe and Russia, such as in his first book, Czechoslovakia: The Velvet Revolution and Beyond (Palgrave Macmillan/St. Martins Press, 2000), which dealt with the post-communist reform process. His research and commentary have since branched out into international security, transatlantic relations, European politics, the global democracy agenda, the impact of the digital revolution on politics and society, and the relationship between the Western world and the State of Israel. His second book, A State Beyond the Pale: Europe's Problem with Israel (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2009), was described by one reviewer as \\"the best book on the Middle East conflict to appear in years\\". Shepherd has also contributed to, and edited many other books and publications including Belarusian opposition leader Andrei Sannikov's biographical account of his time as a political prisoner in KGB jails and labour camps, My Story, which contains a foreword by Nobel Laureate Svetlana Alexievich. Before entering the world of think tanks, he was the Moscow Bureau Chief for The Times. Prior to that he worked for eight years for Reuters in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and London. Shepherd believes he lost his job at Chatham House, which has had an awkward relationship over the years with Israel and the Jewish people, due to his expressing a non-hostile position on Israel.  The Commentator  Shepherd is the owner/publisher of the political news and commentary website The Commentator. The website's stance is described in the \\"About\\" section as \\"Centre-right internationalist\\", though Shepherd's own political outlook is said in that section to have moved on: \\"Owner Robin Shepherd... has developed his thinking to the point that he now regards the old Right-Left dichotomy as redundant. He is working on a book, provisionally entitled Realignment: Democracy in the Digital Revolution, which argues that our inherited democratic structures and thinking are obsolete and that we need to revamp them to suit the changes inaugurated by the digital revolution.\\" Books * * References Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:British columnists Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Alumni of the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies Category:Alumni of the London School of Economics Category:Chatham House people ","title":"Robin Shepherd"},{"id":"20095524","text":"Otto Liebermann (24 November 1898 ‚Äì 6 April 1974) was the first scientist to describe the low-temperature synthesis of dolomite in a reproducible laboratory experiment.

Her playing was admired for its depth and beauty of tone, classical unity and tremendous power. Vera Bradford was born in Melbourne to a musical family. Her mother Edith was a pianist, and her father Frederick and brother Cec were violinists. She started learning the piano at the age of seven, and she graduated from the University of Melbourne Conservatorium in 1927, with the highest honours. In 1928 she took up a scholarship with Percy Grainger in Chicago. (Grainger and his wife Ella became close friends of Vera‚Äôs, and Ella always stayed with Vera on Percy's visits to Australia.) She also studied at the Chicago Musical College with Rudolph Ganz and Alexander Raab. It was Raab who introduced her to the technique that made her famous, the 'arm weight' technique of the Russian teacher Theodor Leschetizky, which she had first experienced when seeing Benno Moiseiwitsch perform in Melbourne in the 1920s. It was this which developed the big tone and control that became a feature of her performances of the works of Brahms, Rachmaninoff and Liszt. Raab insisted she not play the piano for a year, so that she could unlearn her previous techniques, and practise with the piano lid down. Her debut was in 1931 at the Chicago Opera House where she played the Hungarian Gypsy Airs by Sophie Menter, orchestrated by Tchaikovsky. This was followed by a long and triumphant career as a concert pianist in which she gave many first Australian performances ‚Äì George Gershwin's Concerto in F, Richard Strauss's Burleske in D minor (1937), the Sophie Menter piece mentioned above, Debussy's Feux d'artifices, and works by Bart√≥k and William Walton. She played extensively in Australia and with the fledgling Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) orchestras before World War II, and after the war undertook a number of overseas tours. In 1946 she was the first Australian woman to perform the Brahms concertos, which the ABC and Bernard Heinze had previously considered too difficult for a woman. The critic Neville Cardus wrote of a performance of the D minor concerto with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra: \\"Miss Bradford put forth a strength which many men might envy or fear. It was virtuoso playing of a rare order\\". The same attitude had prevailed when she was contracted to premiere Richard Strauss's Burleske with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in 1937. The visiting Finnish conductor Georg Schn√©evoigt discovered the pianist was a woman and demanded she be replaced by a male pianist; but Vera Bradford was not one to be intimidated, and she gave an excellent performance. For many years she was a teacher at Melbourne University. In 1963 she represented Australia at the 2nd International Music Festival in Seoul, Korea and visited Japan, the Philippines, and Hong Kong. For some time in the 1960s she taught students in a private home in Frankston and was loved by her pupils. She continued to be active in music well into the 1970s, being the first pianist to perform a recital for Melbourne television However, for a time during this period, she was excluded from any ABC engagements, due to difficulties she had with the General Manager, Sir Charles Moses, and her recordings were banned. However, in 2010, following a listener request to ABC FM broadcaster Colin Fox (Weekend Breakfast) ABC Radio recording were found from the archives and broadcast. In 1968 she formed the Frankston Music Society and the Frankston Symphony Orchestra, and performed with it on a number of occasions. She also arranged for young pianists such as Geoffrey Tozer and Ronald Farren-Price to appear with the orchestra. Vera Bradford never married, preferring to focus her energies on her musical career. She died on 6 January 2004, eight months short of her 100th birthday, at Tanderra Hostel in Camberwell, Melbourne. She often gave impromptu concerts there for her fellow guests, the last time being just two months before her death. The Frankston campus of Monash University houses a large collection of Vera Bradford's items that she donated; it is known as the Vera Bradford Music Collection.

In April 1955, almost eight months before the arrest of Rosa Parks and a month after the arrest of Claudette Colvin, she was arrested for refusing to give up her bus seat to a white rider.  Biography  = Early life and family = Aurelia Browder was born on January 29, 1919 in Montgomery, Alabama, where she resided her whole life. She was the sole economic support of her six children after she was widowed. She had several different careers throughout her life including working as a seamstress, nurse midwife and teacher She was a strong, smart woman, one who Jo Ann Gibson Robinson described in her memoir as ‚Äúwell- read, highly intelligent, fearless.‚Äù = Education = Browder completed high school in her thirties and eventually earned a bachelor's degree in science from Alabama State University. She graduated with honors and was in the National Alpha Kappa Mu Honor Society there. While at Alabama State University, Browder met Jo Ann Gibson Robinson, a professor in the English Department, fellow Civil Rights activist, and member of the Women's Political Council. Robinson inspired Browder to get involved and tackle the injustices in the transportation system, encouraging her to participate in the lawsuit proposed by the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA). = Involvement in civil rights = Prior to her involvement in the Montgomery bus boycott, Browder was active in the voter registration campaigns of the 1950s. She spent time tutoring African Americans who wanted to take the voter registration exam, worked to eliminate poll taxes, and provided transportation to the courthouse for those who wanted to register. Aurelia Browder became associated with several Civil Rights groups during her time including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA) and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).  Browder v. Gayle  = Arrest and filing of case = Aurelia Browder was arrested on April 19, 1955, almost eight months before the arrest of Rosa Parks and a month after the arrest of Claudette Colvin, for sitting in the white section of a public city bus in Montgomery, Alabama.

Browder was picked as the lead plaintiff because of her age. Two of the other plaintiffs were teenagers, and the other two were senior citizens. Browder was 37 at the time, putting her in the middle of the other plaintiffs and a good representation of all of them.

The City of Montgomery could not enforce any law ‚Äúwhich may require plaintiffs or any other Negroes similarly situated to submit to segregation in the use of bus transportation facilities in the City of Montgomery.‚ÄùGarrow, David J. (1989). The Walking City. Brooklyn, NY: Carlson Publishing Inc. pp. 607‚Äì609, 261‚Äì278. Both the city and the state appealed this decision. On December 17, 1956, the Supreme Court upheld the ruling, issuing a court order to the state of Alabama to desegregate its buses. While the Montgomery bus boycott, sparked by Rosa Parks, gained lasting national attention, it was Browder‚Äôs court case that resulted in segregation laws being declared unconstitutional.  Montgomery bus boycott  The Montgomery Bus Boycott was not a spontaneous event; various organizations in Montgomery ‚Äî including the NAACP, MIA, and Women‚Äôs political council (WPC) ‚Äî had been waiting for the right moment to begin protest. After several women, including the plaintiffs of Browder v. Gayle, refused to give up their seats on the bus, the spark for the boycott was ignited when Rosa Parks was arrested. The boycott, primarily led by Jo Ann Gibson Robinson, began on December 3, 1955, two days after Rosa Parks' arrest.Garrow, David J. (1989). The Walking City. Brooklyn, NY: Carlson Publishing Inc. pp. 607‚Äì609, 261‚Äì278. The boycott lasted a little over a year and served as the face of the movement, gaining national attention and applying pressure on the courts to rule in favor of ending segregation.\\"Montgomery Bus Boycott.\\" HISTORY. https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/montgomery-bus-boycott. Retrieved 18 March 2020. The less public side of the protest was Browder v. Gayle. The Montgomery Improvement Association filed Browder's case instead of Parks‚Äô because it would be able to skip being heard in the local courts. Rosa Parks' case would have had to go through local courts first, where the case might have stayed pending for years. By filing directly with the District Courts, they would also be able to achieve an injunction against the segregation law at the same time.Garrow, David J. (1989). The Walking City. Brooklyn, NY: Carlson Publishing Inc. pp. 607‚Äì609, 261‚Äì278. The boycott ending with Browder v. Gayle‚Äôs ruling, a fact often overlooked by history.

Later life  Browder continued to be an activist and involved with the NAACP, MIA and SCLC after her case was settled. She spent some time teaching veterans at the Loveless School and established her own business later in life. Browder's son, Butler Browder, still lives in Montgomery. He feels that his mother's legacy has been overshadowed. In a 2005 article in the Montgomery Advertiser Butler wrote, ‚ÄúThe truth is Browder vs. Gayle changed the laws that mandated bus segregation. If it weren't for that case and continued efforts to end segregation in this country, we might still be marching.‚Äù  Commemoration  In 2019 a statue of Rosa Parks was unveiled in Montgomery, Alabama, and four granite markers were also unveiled near the statue on the same day to honor four plaintiffs in Browder v.

It is the seat of the Bishop of W√ºrzburg and has served as the burial place for the Prince-Bishops of W√ºrzburg for hundreds of years. With an overall length of 103 metres, it is the fourth largest Romanesque church building in Germany,\\"Dom St. Kilian\\", Stadt W√ºrzburg and a masterpiece of German architecture from the Salian period. Notable later additions include work by Tilman Riemenschneider and Balthasar Neumann. The cathedral was heavily damaged by British bombs in March 1945 but rebuilt post- World War II.  History  W√ºrzburg Cathedral (1904) The present cathedral was built from 1040 onwards by Bishop Bruno of W√ºrzburgis. It likely was the third church on the site: the previous two, built in about 787 and 855, were respectively destroyed and severely damaged by fire. After Bruno's accidental death in 1045, his successor Adalbero completed the building in 1075. Due to several rebuildings, notably after 1133, the cathedral was only consecrated in 1187. This church already had the strong cross lay-out still present today: a long nave with a high choir, the broad transept and the two narrow western towers. After 1237, the originally lower eastern towers were raised, showing features of early Gothic style. The side aisles were remodelled in about 1500 in the late Gothic style. The stuccoist Pietro Magno decorated the cathedral in Baroque stucco work in 1701-04. In 1721-34, Balthasar Neumann built the burial chapel for the Sch√∂nborn bishops, north of the transept. Around the foot of the eastern tower, he also added a Baroque vestry and Ornatkammer (1749). Additional changes made to the western fa√ßade and towers in 1879-85 (see picture of the cathedral in 1904) were removed after 1946. The greater part of the building collapsed in the winter of 1946 in consequence of the fire bombing of W√ºrzburg on 16 March 1945. Reconstruction was completed in 1967, in the course of which the Baroque components were removed in favour of a re-Romanisation. The new interpretation emphasizes the contrast between the surviving historical parts of the structure, resulting in a sometimes controversial combination of predominantly Romanesque with modern and Baroque elements. The Romanesque Revival west front with a rose window, the tripartite gallery and the opening for the clock were combined during the reconstruction with a plain pumice stone wall, and revealed again during renovation work up to November 2006. In 1988 the choir was redesigned by Hubert Els√§sser. The stucco ceiling that had collapsed in 1946 was not rebuilt, but replaced by a flat wooden ceiling. Description With a length of 103 metres, the cathedral is reckoned to be the fourth largest Romanesque basilica in Germany. = Works of art = The cathedral contains numerous works of art, of which the following are of especial note: * A series of tombs and epitaphs of bishops, including the monumental effigies of the prince-bishops Rudolf II von Scherenberg (1495) and Lorenz von Bibra (1519), both by Tilman Riemenschneider * Sch√∂nborn Chapel by Balthasar Neumann and Maximilian von Welsch with the tombs of Johann Philipp von Sch√∂nborn, Lothar Franz von Sch√∂nborn, Johann Philipp Franz von Sch√∂nborn and Friedrich Karl von Sch√∂nborn * Double crypt. The eastern part dates from 1040 and contains the tomb of Bruno. The western one (12th century) was demolished around 1700 but rebuilt after 1962. It features an old well, the tomb of Conrad of Querfurt and the oldest piece of art of the cathedral: a bearded face which may be Carolingean or even Merovingian in origin. * Burial chapel/Sepulture: Like the chapter hall above, the Gothic structure was destroyed in the bombing raids but has been rebuilt. It now contains a cycle of stained glass by Georg Meistermann.Bistum W√ºrzburg website (German) * Baptismal font (1279), by Meister Eckart of Worms * Seven- armed candelabra (1981) by Andreas Moritz =Layout of the main level of the building= Floor plan View of the cathedral from Marienberg Fortress 350px :1.

There is a second organ for the choir, and a third is planned for 2010. = Bells = The cathedral today has 20 bells, with a total combined weight of 26 tons. The largest is the Salvator Bell with a diameter of 2.3 m and weighing in at 10 tons. Of the old bells only the \\"Lobdeburg Bell\\", by Cunradus Citewar of W√ºrzburg, the most prominent bellfounder of his time, dates from 1257. Because it was taken down in 1933 and stored in the crypt, it is the only ancient bell of the cathedral to have survived the firestorm caused by the bombing of 16 March 1945. It now hangs in the south- west tower and is rung every Friday at 3.00 p.m., to mark the hour of the death of Jesus Christ.

The original church on this site was built in 1178, shortly after the arrival of the Anglo-Normans in the town. It was named after St. Werburgh, abbess of Ely and patron saint of Chester. The current building was constructed in 1719. It is located in Werburgh Street, close to Dublin Castle. The church In Celtic and Danish times, the parish was known as that of St. Martin of Tours, and his church stood near the south end of Werburgh Street. After St. Werburgh's Church was constructed it was much frequented by Bristol men, who were amongst the earliest settlers in Dublin. It contained chapels in honour of Our Lady, St. Martin and St. Catherine.Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland (1915) p. 33 The original church was burned down in 1311 (along with much of the city) and was rebuilt. From the time of Archbishop Henry de Loundres (died 1228), St. Werburgh's was appropriated to the Chancellor of St. Patrick's. By 1559 the nearby church of St. Mary del Dam on Dame Street was closed and its parish incorporated in that of St. Werburgh‚Äôs, which meant that St. Werburgh‚Äôs became the parish church of Dublin Castle. Primate James Ussher was appointed to this church in 1607, and Edward Wetenhall, afterwards Bishop of Kilmore, author of the well-known Greek and Latin Grammars, was curate here. Swift's friend, Dr. Patrick Delany (1685-1768), was rector of the parish in 1730. St. Werburgh's in 1808, showing the tower and steeple During the 17th century conflicts erupted between the parish of St. Werburgh and that of nearby St. John the Evangelist (located in Fishamble Street) over parish boundaries. Each vestry wanted houses to levy rates on. The contested houses were in Copper Alley and those around Essex Gate and Essex Bridge. The church needed replacement by the end of the seventeenth century. An act of 1715 which passed through the Irish Parliament appointed commissioners for building a new church.G. N. Wright Colonel Thomas Burgh, M.P. for Naas, Surveyor-General for Public Buildings, was entrusted with the erection of the new structure. This was completed, so far as to admit of the celebration of divine service, in 1719, at a cost of ¬£8,000. However, it was damaged by fire in 1754 and did not re-open until 1759. The present interior dates from this time, and was designed by John Smyth.Craig (1969) p. 178 Perhaps it is because of this that the area's fire engines used to be stored in the church porch; the church today holds the oldest surviving fire appliances in the city.http://comeheretome.com/2012/05/25/the-remarkable-and- forgotten-captain-james-robert-ingram/ In the eighteenth century St. Werburgh's came into vogue as the parish church of the British Lord Lieutenant and his entourage, where he had his own Viceregal pew inserted in 1767.Craig (1969) p. 178 In fact the pew register for this church lists many of the persons prominent in Dublin public life in this century. Around the same time John Smith (or Smyth) was the architect of an upper gallery for schoolchildren. The tower and spire were added the following year. The spire was removed around 1810 by the Castle authorities as a security measure, as it overlooked the Castle yard. They used as an excuse that the tower was unsafe (whereupon the architect Francis Johnston offered to make it safe, but was rejected); the tower was felled twenty-six years later.Craig (1969) p. 178 The interior of the church was re-modeled in 1877 by the architect William Welland, when the parish was united with that of St. John the Evangelist. The parish The parish corresponds with the civil parish of the same name. The Organ In the year 1754, an accidental fire was started within the church which left nothing except the stone-work and bells. Sir Philip Hoey, a clergyman attached at one time to St Werburgh's church, left a sum of money to purchase an organ. It was built by Millars of College Street and first publicly performed in June 1768. On the 3rd of May, 1787, a commemoration of Handel was performed in St. Werburgh's Church by amateurs of the highest distinction, including Sir Hercules Langrishe, Baron Dillon, Surgeon Neale, Lady Portarlington and Mrs. Stopford. The present organ was first built by the local eighteenth century organ builder Ferdinand Weber and restored by Telford and Telford around 1870 within the case of the organ originally installed. The instrument comprises two manuals and pedals, with mechanical action throughout, and a total of fifteen stops, with one further stop prepared for but never inserted. The gilded front pipes and a number of the internal pipes are of eighteenth century origin. The manual keyboards of normal compass, 56 notes, but the pedals are of a transitional mid-nineteenth century design featuring only 25 notes. The organ still contains a space for individuals to pump the bellows of the organ, a practice which was necessary before the widespread electrification of the instrument from the 1960s. This space contains a number of historical pieces of graffiti. George Frideric Handel used this instrument for the rehearsal of his work Messiah which premiered in the Great Music Hall, Fishamble Street. Notable parishioners John Field, composer and pianist was baptized in this church on 5 September 1782. There is a collection of parish deeds from the parish of St. Werburgh dating from 1317 to 1662, listing property owners in the parish. They were catalogued by the Royal Irish Academy between 1916 and 1919.Ryan, 2001 Burials There was a churchyard next to the church used for hundreds of years and beneath the church are twenty-seven vaults.Gilbert, 1854 Nicholas Sutton, the Attorney General for Ireland, was buried here in 1478; his family had lived on Werburgh Street for several generations. Sir James Ware (1594-1666), historian, was buried here in December 1666. Lord Edward Fitzgerald, commander-in-chief of the United Irishmen was buried in the vaults of this church on 5 June 1798, while his captor, Major Sirr, was buried in the churchyard in 1841.

It was designed by Shai Halevi, William E. Hall, and Charanjit S. Jutla. Fugue takes an arbitrary-length message and compresses it down to a fixed bit-length (either 224, 256, 384 or 512 bits). The hash functions for the different output lengths are called Fugue-224, Fugue-256, Fugue-384 and Fugue-512. The authors also describe a parametrized version of Fugue. A weak version of Fugue-256 is also described using this parameterized version. The selling point of Fugue is the authors' claimed proof that a wide range of current attack strategies based on differential cryptanalysis cannot be efficient against Fugue. It is also claimed to be competitive with the NIST hash function SHA-256 in both software and hardware efficiency, achieving up to 36.2 cycles per byte on an Intel Family 6 Model 15 Xeon 5150, and up to 25 cycles per byte on an Intel Core 2 processor T7700. On 45 nm Core2 processors, e.g. T9400, Fugue-256 runs at 16 cycles per byte using SSE4.1 instructions. On the newer Westmere architectures (32 nm), e.g. Core i5, Fugue-256 runs at 14 cycles/byte. Fugue's design starts from the hash function Grindahl, and like Grindahl uses the S-box from AES, but it replaces the 4√ó4 column mixing matrix with a 16√ó16 \\"super-mix\\" operation which greatly improves diffusion. The \\"super-mix\\" operation is, however, only slightly more computationally expensive to implement than the AES mixing strategy.  SuperMix  The 224 and 256 bit variants of Fugue work with a state which can be represented in 4 by 30 matrix of unsigned bytes, whereas the 384 and 512 bit variants work with a 4 by 36 byte matrix. Operations can be performed in-place on this state. The core of the algorithm, known as the \\"SuperMix transformation\\", takes 4√ó4 matrix as input and returns a new 4x4 matrix. The input to SuperMix is simply the first four columns of the current 30-column state and the output is used to replace this same state area (i.e. SuperMix affects only the 4x4 matrix at the head of the state). The SuperMix function can be defined as: \\\\text{SuperMix}(U) = \\\\text{ROL} \\\\left( M \\\\cdot U + \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\sum_{j e 0} U_j^i & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\\\sum_{j e 1} U_j^i & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & \\\\sum_{j e 2} U_j^i & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \\\\sum_{j e 3} U_j^i \\\\end{pmatrix} \\\\cdot M^T \\\\right) where: : M = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 4 & 7 & 1\\\\ 1 & 1 & 4 & 7\\\\ 7 & 1 & 1 & 4\\\\ 4 & 7 & 1 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} ; :U is a 4x4 matrix of bytes (i.e. the matrix after the S-box substitution of the input); and :M^T is the transpose of M. The transformation ROL takes a 4x4 matrix, and rotates the i-th row to the left by i bytes, i.e. : \\\\text{ROL}(W)_j^i = W_{j-i \\\\pmod 4}^{i}  Fugue 2.0  Fugue 2.0 is a tweak of original Fugue, which runs at about twice the speed of Fugue for 256-bit output.

Description As with the ice- type models, the eight-vertex model is a square lattice model, where each state is a configuration of arrows at a vertex. The allowed vertices have an even number of arrows pointing towards the vertex; these include the six inherited from the ice-type model (1-6), and sinks and sources (7, 8). Eightvertex2 We consider a N\\\\times N lattice, with N^2 vertices and 2N^2 edges. Imposing periodic boundary conditions requires that the states 7 and 8 occur equally often, as do states 5 and 6, and thus can be taken to have the same energy. For the zero-field case the same is true for the two other pairs of states. Each vertex j has an associated energy \\\\epsilon_j and Boltzmann weight w_j=e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\epsilon_j}{kT}}, giving the partition function over the lattice as : Z=\\\\sum \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\sum_j n_j\\\\epsilon_j}{kT}\\\\right) where the summation is over all allowed configurations of vertices in the lattice. In this general form the partition function remains unsolved. Solution in the zero-field case The zero-field case of the model corresponds physically to the absence of external electric fields. Hence, the model remains unchanged under the reversal of all arrows; the states 1 and 2, and 3 and 4, consequently must occur as pairs. The vertices can be assigned arbitrary weights : \\\\begin{align} w_1=w_2&=a\\\\ w_3=w_4&=b\\\\ w_5=w_6&=c\\\\ w_7=w_8&=d. \\\\end{align} The solution is based on the observation that rows in transfer matrices commute, for a certain parametrisation of these four Boltzmann weights. This came about as a modification of an alternate solution for the six-vertex model; it makes use of elliptic theta functions. =Commuting transfer matrices= The proof relies on the fact that when \\\\Delta'=\\\\Delta and \\\\Gamma'=\\\\Gamma, for quantities : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Delta&=\\\\frac{a^2+b^2-c^2-d^2}{2(ab+cd)}\\\\ \\\\Gamma&=\\\\frac{ab-cd}{ab+cd} \\\\end{align} the transfer matrices T and T' (associated with the weights a, b, c, d and a', b', c', d') commute. Using the star-triangle relation, Baxter reformulated this condition as equivalent to a parametrisation of the weights given as : a:b:c:d=\\\\operatorname{snh}(\\\\eta-u):\\\\operatorname{snh} (\\\\eta +u):\\\\operatorname{snh} (2\\\\eta): k\\\\operatorname{snh} (2\\\\eta)\\\\operatorname{snh} (\\\\eta-u)\\\\operatorname{snh} (\\\\eta+u) for fixed modulus k and \\\\eta and variable u. Here snh is the hyperbolic analogue of sn, given by : \\\\begin{align} \\\\operatorname {snh} (u) &=-i\\\\operatorname {snh} (iu) \\\\ \\\\text{where } \\\\operatorname {snh} (u)&= \\\\frac{H(u)}{k^{1/2}\\\\Theta(u)} \\\\end{align} and H(u) and \\\\Theta(u) are Jacobi elliptic functions of modulus k. The associated transfer matrix T thus is a function of u alone; for all u, v : T(u)T(v)=T(v)T(u). =The matrix function Q(u)= The other crucial part of the solution is the existence of a nonsingular matrix-valued function Q, such that for all complex u the matrices Q(u), Q(u') commute with each other and the transfer matrices, and satisfy where : \\\\begin{align} \\\\zeta(u)&=[c^{-1}H(2\\\\eta)\\\\Theta(u-\\\\eta)\\\\Theta(u+\\\\eta)]^N\\\\ \\\\phi(u)&=[\\\\Theta(0)H(u)\\\\Theta(u)]^N. \\\\end{align} The existence and commutation relations of such a function are demonstrated by considering pair propagations through a vertex, and periodicity relations of the theta functions, in a similar way to the six-vertex model. =Explicit solution= The commutation of matrices in () allow them to be diagonalised, and thus eigenvalues can be found. The partition function is calculated from the maximal eigenvalue, resulting in a free energy per site of : \\\\begin{align} f=\\\\epsilon_5-2kT\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{\\\\sinh^2((\\\\tau-\\\\lambda)n)(\\\\cosh(n\\\\lambda)-\\\\cosh(n\\\\alpha))}{n\\\\sinh(2n\\\\tau)\\\\cosh(n\\\\lambda)} \\\\end{align} for : \\\\begin{align} \\\\tau&=\\\\frac{\\\\pi K'}{2K}\\\\ \\\\lambda&=\\\\frac{\\\\pi \\\\eta}{iK}\\\\ \\\\alpha&=\\\\frac{\\\\pi u}{iK} \\\\end{align} where K and K' are the complete elliptic integrals of moduli k and k'. The eight vertex model was also solved in quasicrystals. Equivalence with an Ising model There is a natural correspondence between the eight-vertex model, and the Ising model with 2-spin and 4-spin nearest neighbour interactions. The states of this model are spins \\\\sigma=\\\\pm 1 on faces of a square lattice. The analogue of 'edges' in the eight-vertex model are products of spins on adjacent faces: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\alpha_{ij}&=\\\\sigma_{ij}\\\\sigma_{i,j+1}\\\\ \\\\mu_{ij}&=\\\\sigma_{ij}\\\\sigma_{i+1,j}. \\\\end{align} Isingduallattice The most general form of the energy for this model is : \\\\begin{align} \\\\epsilon&=-\\\\sum_{ij}(J_h\\\\mu_{ij}+J_v\\\\alpha_{ij}+J\\\\alpha_{ij}\\\\mu_{ij}+J'\\\\alpha_{i+1,j}\\\\mu_{ij}+J\\\\alpha_{ij}\\\\alpha_{i+1,j}) \\\\end{align} where J_h, J_v, J, J' describe the horizontal, vertical and two diagonal 2-spin interactions, and J describes the 4-spin interaction between four faces at a vertex; the sum is over the whole lattice. Isinginteractions We denote horizontal and vertical spins (arrows on edges) in the eight-vertex model \\\\mu, \\\\alpha respectively, and define up and right as positive directions. The restriction on vertex states is that the product of four edges at a vertex is 1; this automatically holds for Ising 'edges'. Each \\\\sigma configuration then corresponds to a unique \\\\mu, \\\\alpha configuration, whereas each \\\\mu, \\\\alpha configuration gives two choices of \\\\sigma configurations. Equating general forms of Boltzmann weights for each vertex j, the following relations between the \\\\epsilon_j and J_h, J_v, J, J', J define the correspondence between the lattice models: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\epsilon_1&=-J_h- J_v-J-J'-J,\\\\quad \\\\epsilon_2=J_h+J_v-J-J'-J\\\\ \\\\epsilon_3&=-J_h+J_v+J+J'-J,\\\\quad \\\\epsilon_4=J_h-J_v+J+J'-J\\\\ \\\\epsilon_5&=\\\\epsilon_6=J-J'+J\\\\ \\\\epsilon_7&=\\\\epsilon_8=-J+J'+J. \\\\end{align} It follows that in the zero-field case of the eight-vertex model, the horizontal and vertical interactions in the corresponding Ising model vanish. These relations gives the equivalence Z_I=2Z_{8V} between the partition functions of the eight-vertex model, and the 2,4-spin Ising model. Consequently a solution in either model would lead immediately to a solution in the other.

Early life Jennings was born in 1825 in Fairfield, Connecticut, to Abraham Gold Jennings and Anna (n√©e Burr) Jennings. His brother was Frederick B. Jennings. At a young age he came to New York to learn the dry goods business. Through his great-grandfather, Peter Burr, he was distantly related to U.S. Vice President Aaron Burr. Career In 1849, he headed West to seek his fortune in the California Gold Rush. He set up a general mercantile store in San Francisco with Benjamin Brewster and amassed a considerable fortune by outfitting prospecting camps along the coast and around Sacramento. =Standard Oil= In 1862, he returned to New York with the intention of retiring from all business activities. Due to his close relationship with his wife's brother-in-law, William Avery Rockefeller, Jr., he became interested in the affairs of the Standard Oil Company. In 1871, when Standard Oil was incorporated in Ohio, Jennings was one of the original stockholders. Of the initial 10,000 shares, John D. Rockefeller received 2,667; William Rockefeller, Henry Flagler, and Samuel Andrews received 1,333 each; Stephen V. Harkness received 1,334; Jennings received 1,000; and the firm of Rockefeller, Andrews & Flagler received 1,000.

The first such model was introduced by Linus Pauling in 1935 to account for the residual entropy of water ice. Variants have been proposed as models of certain ferroelectric and antiferroelectric crystals. In 1967, Elliott H. Lieb found the exact solution to a two-dimensional ice model known as \\"square ice\\". The exact solution in three dimensions is only known for a special \\"frozen\\" state. Description An ice-type model is a lattice model defined on a lattice of coordination number 4. That is, each vertex of the lattice is connected by an edge to four \\"nearest neighbours\\". A state of the model consists of an arrow on each edge of the lattice, such that the number of arrows pointing inwards at each vertex is 2. This restriction on the arrow configurations is known as the ice rule. In graph theoretic terms, the states are Eulerian orientations of an underlying 4-regular undirected graph. The partition function also counts the number of nowhere-zero 3-flows. For two-dimensional models, the lattice is taken to be the square lattice. For more realistic models, one can use a three-dimensional lattice appropriate to the material being considered; for example, the hexagonal ice lattice is used to analyse ice. At any vertex, there are six configurations of the arrows which satisfy the ice rule (justifying the name \\"six-vertex model\\"). The valid configurations for the (two-dimensional) square lattice are the following: :500px The energy of a state is understood to be a function of the configurations at each vertex. For square lattices, one assumes that the total energy E is given by : E = n_1\\\\epsilon_1 + n_2\\\\epsilon_2 + \\\\ldots + n_6\\\\epsilon_6, for some constants \\\\epsilon_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\epsilon_6, where n_i here denotes the number of vertices with the ith configuration from the above figure. The value \\\\epsilon_i is the energy associated with vertex configuration number i. One aims to calculate the partition function Z of an ice-type model, which is given by the formula : Z = \\\\sum \\\\exp(-E/k_BT), where the sum is taken over all states of the model, E is the energy of the state, k_B is Boltzmann's constant, and T is the system's temperature. Typically, one is interested in the thermodynamic limit in which the number N of vertices approaches infinity. In that case, one instead evaluates the free energy per vertex f in the limit as N\\\\to \\\\infty, where f is given by : f = -k_BT N^{-1}\\\\log Z. Equivalently, one evaluates the partition function per vertex W in the thermodynamic limit, where :W=Z^{1/N}. The values f and W are related by :f= -k_BT \\\\log W. Physical justification Several real crystals with hydrogen bonds satisfy the ice model, including ice and potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP). Indeed, such crystals motivated the study of ice-type models. In ice, each oxygen atom is connected by a bond to four other oxygens, and each bond contains one hydrogen atom between the terminal oxygens. The hydrogen occupies one of two symmetrically located positions, neither of which is in the middle of the bond. Pauling argued that the allowed configuration of hydrogen atoms is such that there are always exactly two hydrogens close to each oxygen, thus making the local environment imitate that of a water molecule, . Thus, if we take the oxygen atoms as the lattice vertices and the hydrogen bonds as the lattice edges, and if we draw an arrow on a bond which points to the side of the bond on which the hydrogen atom sits, then ice satisfies the ice model. Similar reasoning applies to show that KDP also satisfies the ice model. Specific choices of vertex energies On the square lattice, the energies \\\\epsilon_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\epsilon_6 associated with vertex configurations 1-6 determine the relative probabilities of states, and thus can influence the macroscopic behaviour of the system. The following are common choices for these vertex energies. =The ice model= When modeling ice, one takes \\\\epsilon_1=\\\\epsilon_2=\\\\ldots=\\\\epsilon_6=0, as all permissible vertex configurations are understood to be equally likely. In this case, the partition function Z equals the total number of valid states. This model is known as the ice model (as opposed to an ice-type model). =The KDP model of a ferroelectric= Slater argued that KDP could be represented by an ice-type model with energies : \\\\epsilon_1=\\\\epsilon_2=0, \\\\epsilon_3=\\\\epsilon_4=\\\\epsilon_5=\\\\epsilon_6>0 For this model (called the KDP model), the most likely state (the least-energy state) has all horizontal arrows pointing in the same direction, and likewise for all vertical arrows. Such a state is a ferroelectric state, in which all hydrogen atoms have a preference for one fixed side of their bonds. =Rys F model of an antiferroelectric= The Rys F model is obtained by setting : \\\\epsilon_1=\\\\epsilon_2=\\\\epsilon_3=\\\\epsilon_4>0, \\\\epsilon_5=\\\\epsilon_6=0. The least-energy state for this model is dominated by vertex configurations 5 and 6. For such a state, adjacent horizontal bonds necessarily have arrows in opposite directions and similarly for vertical bonds, so this state is an antiferroelectric state. =The zero field assumption= If there is no ambient electric field, then the total energy of a state should remain unchanged under a charge reversal, i.e. under flipping all arrows. Thus one may assume without loss of generality that : \\\\epsilon_1=\\\\epsilon_2, \\\\quad \\\\epsilon_3=\\\\epsilon_4, \\\\quad \\\\epsilon_5=\\\\epsilon_6 This assumption is known as the zero field assumption, and holds for the ice model, the KDP model, and the Rys F model. History The ice rule was introduced by Linus Pauling in 1935 to account for the residual entropy of ice that had been measured by William F. Giauque and J. W. Stout. The residual entropy, S , of ice is given by the formula : S= k_B\\\\log Z = k_B\\\\, N \\\\, \\\\log W, where k_B is Boltzmann's constant, N is the number of oxygen atoms in the piece of ice, which is always taken to be large (the thermodynamic limit) and Z=W^N is the number of configurations of the hydrogen atoms according to Pauling's ice rule. Without the ice rule we would have W =4 since the number of hydrogen atoms is 2N and each hydrogen has two possible locations. Pauling estimated that the ice rule reduces this to W =1.5 , a number that would agree extremely well with the Giauque-Stout measurement of S . It can be said that Pauling's calculation of S for ice is one of the simplest, yet most accurate applications of statistical mechanics to real substances ever made. The question that remained was whether, given the model, Pauling's calculation of W , which was very approximate, would be sustained by a rigorous calculation. This became a significant problem in combinatorics. Both the three-dimensional and two-dimensional models were computed numerically by John F. Nagle in 1966 who found that W = 1.50685 \\\\pm 0.00015 in three-dimensions and W= 1.540 \\\\pm0.001 in two-dimensions. Both are amazingly close to Pauling's rough calculation, 1.5. In 1967, Lieb found the exact solution of three two- dimensional ice-type models: the ice model, the Rys F model, and the KDP model. The solution for the ice model gave the exact value of W in two- dimensions as : W_{2D} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{4}{3}\\\\right)^{3/2} = 1.5396007.... which is known as Lieb's square ice constant. Later in 1967, Bill Sutherland generalised Lieb's solution of the three specific ice-type models to a general exact solution for square-lattice ice-type models satisfying the zero field assumption. Still later in 1967, C. P. Yang generalised Sutherland's solution to an exact solution for square-lattice ice-type models in a horizontal electric field. In 1969, John Nagle derived the exact solution for a three- dimensional version of the KDP model, for a specific range of temperatures. For such temperatures, the model is \\"frozen\\" in the sense that (in the thermodynamic limit) the energy per vertex and entropy per vertex are both zero. This is the only known exact solution for a three-dimensional ice-type model. Relation to eight-vertex model The eight-vertex model, which has also been exactly solved, is a generalisation of the (square-lattice) six- vertex model: to recover the six-vertex model from the eight-vertex model, set the energies for vertex configurations 7 and 8 to infinity. Six-vertex models have been solved in some cases for which the eight-vertex model has not; for example, Nagle's solution for the three-dimensional KDP model and Yang's solution of the six-vertex model in a horizontal field. Boundary conditions This ice model provide an important 'counterexample' in statistical mechanics: the bulk free energy in the thermodynamic limit depends on boundary conditions. The model was analytically solved for periodic boundary conditions, anti-periodic, ferromagnetic and domain wall boundary conditions. The six vertex model with domain wall boundary conditions on a square lattice has specific significance in combinatorics, it helps to enumerate alternating sign matrices. In this case the partition function can be represented as a determinant of a matrix (whose dimension is equal to the size of the lattice), but in other cases the enumeration of W does not come out in such a simple closed form. Clearly, the largest W is given by free boundary conditions (no constraint at all on the configurations on the boundary), but the same W occurs, in the thermodynamic limit, for periodic boundary conditions, as used originally to derive W_{2D}. 3-colorings of a lattice The number of states of an ice type model on the internal edges of a finite simply connected union of squares of a lattice is equal to one third of the number of ways to 3-color the squares, with no two adjacent squares having the same color. This correspondence between states is due to Andrew Lenard and is given as follows. If a square has color i = 0, 1, or 2, then the arrow on the edge to an adjacent square goes left or right (according to an observer in the square) depending on whether the color in the adjacent square is i+1 or i‚àí1 mod 3. There are 3 possible ways to color a fixed initial square, and once this initial color is chosen this gives a 1:1 correspondence between colorings and arrangements of arrows satisfying the ice-type condition.

A copy of the list was published in The Guardian in 2003 and the original was released by the Foreign Office soon after. Background The Information Research Department (IRD) was a propaganda unit set up by the Labour government in 1948 at the Foreign Office, after the start of the Cold War. Celia Kirwan, a close friend of Orwell who had just started working as Robert Conquest's assistant at the IRD, visited Orwell at a sanatorium where he was being treated for tuberculosis in March 1949. Orwell wrote a list of names of persons he considered sympathetic to Stalinism and therefore unsuitable as writers for the Department, and enclosed it in a letter to Kirwan. The list became public in 2003. Having worked for Cyril Connolly's Horizon magazine, and briefly as an editorial assistant for Humphrey Slater's Polemic, Kirwan was Arthur Koestler's sister-in-law and one of the four women to whom Orwell proposed after the death of his wife Eileen O'Shaughnessy in 1945. Although Koestler had supported such a match, Kirwan turned him down.Celia [Goodman] in Notebook Orwell based his list on a private notebook he had maintained since the mid-1940s of possible \\"cryptos\\", \\"F.T.\\" (his abbreviation for fellow travellers), members of the Communist Party of Great Britain, agents and sentimental sympathisers. The notebook, now at the Orwell Archive at University College London, contains 135 names in all, including US writers and politicians. Ten names had been crossed out, either because the person had died or because Orwell had decided that they were neither crypto-communists nor fellow travellers. The people named were a m√©lange: \\"some famous, some obscure, some he knew personally and others he did not.\\" Orwell commented in New Leader in 1947: > The important thing to do with these people ‚Äì and it is extremely difficult, > since one has only inferential evidence ‚Äì is to sort them out and determine > which of them is honest and which is not. There is, for instance, a whole > group of M.P.s in the British Parliament ([Denis Nowell] Pritt, [Konni] > Zilliacus, etc.) who are commonly nicknamed \\"the cryptos\\". They have > undoubtedly done a great deal of mischief, especially in confusing public > opinion about the nature of the puppet regimes in Eastern Europe; but one > ought not hurriedly to assume that they all hold the same opinions. Probably > some of them are actuated by nothing worse than stupidity. The notebook contained columns with names, comments and various markings. Typical comments were: Stephen Spender ‚Äì \\"Sentimental sympathiser... Tendency towards homosexuality\\"; Richard Crossman ‚Äì \\"Too dishonest to be outright F. T.\\"; Kingsley Martin ‚Äì\\"Decayed liberal. Very dishonest\\";Orwell, George, Unpublished Notebook, 1948 and Paul Robeson ‚Äì \\"very anti-white. [Henry] Wallace supporter\\". Journalist Geoffrey Wheatcroft considered Orwell's remarks \\"perceptive and sometimes even generous\\", going on to say that \\"DN Pritt is described as an 'almost certainly underground' Communist but also a \\"Good MP (i.e. locally). Very able and courageous'\\". Among the names, Orwell selected 38 which he forwarded to Kirwan. Richard Rees discussed the names with Orwell, later commenting that it was \\"a sort of game we played ‚Äì discussing who was a paid agent of what and estimating to what lengths of treachery our favourite b√™tes noires would be prepared to go.\\"Rees, Richard, Letter to Ian Angus, 10 June 1967 Orwell asked Rees to fetch the notebook from Orwell's former residence on the Scottish island of Jura, Scotland in early 1949, thanking him in a letter of 17 April. One of Orwell's biographers, Bernard Crick, thought there were 86 names in the list and that some of the names were written in the hand of Koestler, who also co-operated with the IRD in producing anti- Communist propaganda. Orwell was an ex-colonial policeman in Burma and according to Timothy Garton Ash, he liked making lists: 'In a \\"London Letter\\" to Partisan Review in 1942 he wrote, \\"I think I could make out at least a preliminary list of the people who would go over to the Nazi side if the Germans occupied England.\\"' Reactions to the list The British press had known about the list for some years before it was officially made public in 2003. In 1996 The Independent discussed the list and who was named on it in an article headlined, \\"Orwell's little list leaves the left gasping for more\\".https://www.independent.co.uk/news/orwells-little-list-leaves-the-left- gasping-for-more-1328633.html In 1998 The Daily Telegraph \\"broke\\" the story with the headline \\"Socialist Icon Who Became an Informer\\". Michael Foot, the former leader of the Labour Party and a friend of Orwell in the 1930s and 1940s, was \\"amazed\\" by the revelation. Richard Gott, who in 1994 had resigned as literary editor of The Guardian after admitting that he had accepted travel expenses from the KGB in an unrelated case, referred to Orwell's list as only a \\"small surprise\\". The journalist and activist Norman Ian MacKenzie, who was on the list, noted \\"Tubercular people often could get very strange towards the end. I'm an Orwell man, I agreed with him on the Soviet Union, but he went partly ga-ga I think. He let his dislike of the New Statesman crowd, of what he saw as leftish, dilettante, sentimental socialists who covered up for the Popular Front in Spain [after it became communist-controlled] get the better of him.\\" Bernard Crick justified Orwell wanting to help the post-war Labour government. \\"He did it because he thought the Communist Party was a totalitarian menace,\\" he said. \\"He wasn't denouncing these people as subversives. He was denouncing them as unsuitable for a counter-intelligence operation.\\" Professor Peter Davison, editor of Orwell's Complete Works, said those who would be really disappointed would be those who claimed to have been on the list but were not. The historian John Newsinger considered it \\"a terrible mistake on his part, deriving in equal measure from his hostility to Stalinism and his illusions in the Labour government. What it certainly does not amount to, however, is an abandonment of the socialist cause or transformation into a footsoldier in the Cold War. Indeed, Orwell made clear on a number of occasions his opposition to any British McCarthyism, to any bans and proscriptions on Communist Party members (they certainly did not reciprocate this) and any notion of a preventive war. If he had lived long enough to realise what the IRD was actually about there can be no doubt that he would have broken with it\\". The journalist Neal Ascherson was critical of Orwell's decision to give the information to the IRD, claiming \\"there is a difference between being determined to expose the stupidity of Stalinism and the scale of the purges and throwing yourself into the business of denouncing people you know.\\" The journalist and activist Paul Foot said the revelations would not detract from Orwell's reputation as a great writer, noting \\"I am a great admirer of Orwell, but we have to accept that he did take a McCarthyite position towards the end of his life.\\" The journalist and writer Alexander Cockburn was strongly critical of Orwell's actions, referring to the notebook as \\"a snitch list\\". Cockburn attacked Orwell's description of Paul Robeson as \\"anti-white\\", pointing out Robeson had campaigned to help Welsh coal miners. Cockburn also said the list revealed Orwell as a bigot: \\"There seems to be general agreement by Orwell's fans, left and right, to skate gently over Orwell's suspicions of Jews, homosexuals and blacks\\". Celia Kirwan said: > I think George was quite right to do it. ... And, of course, everybody > thinks that these people were going to be shot at dawn. The only thing that > was going to happen to them was that they wouldn't be asked to write for the > Information Research Department.

It is located on what was once termed the \\"Sl√≠ Mh√≥r\\" (Irish: Great Way), a key route that ran westwards across Ireland from Dublin. The church was rebuilt in its present form in the 18th century by John Smyth (or Smith). The church closed in 1966 due to a decrease in the size of the local congregation.CoreChurch.ie - About us - History The church was de-consecrated the following year, and for a period was used by Dublin Corporation for exhibitions and concerts. After a period of decline, and later of refurbishment, St. Catherine's was re-consecrated and has been the place of worship for the Anglican \\"CORE\\" church (City Outreach for Renewal and Evangelism) since then. History =Parish history= In 1177 the parish of St. James is mentioned as part of the Augustinian abbey of St. Thomas (from which Thomas Street got its name), and the church of St. Catherine was a chapel-of-ease to the abbey. By the end of the 13th century the western suburbs had so increased in population that a separate parish was deemed necessary, which was provided for by splitting the parish of St. James and setting up an independent parish for St. Catherine's.Short Histories of Dublin Parishes. Part IX. at www.chaptersofdublin.com Both parishes were still subservient to the Abbey of St. Thomas, but in 1539 the abbey was dissolved with all the monasteries by Henry VIII. In the surrender made by Henry Duffe, last Abbot, were included \\"the Churches of St. Catherine and St. James near Dublin.\\" Both churches, now independent, had new curates appointed by the crown: Sir John Brace to St. Catherine's (which was shortly taken over by Peter Ledwich (or Ledwidge)) and Sir John Butler to St. James. Over the following hundred years both churches passed over to the reformed church, while Roman Catholic priests led a precarious existence tending to the larger part of the population, which remained faithful to the old religion. The parish of St. Catherine appears to have been the only viable one in the area at that time ‚Äî Roman Catholics eventually got the use of a chapel in Dirty Lane (now Bridgefoot Street) towards the end of the 17th century. Later, another St. Catherine's was founded in Meath Street to cater for the Catholic population. The two Church of Ireland parishes were separated in 1710. =Building history= A print illustrating the execution of Robert Emmet outside St. Catherine's, which can be seen in the background Robert Emmet's marker in front of the church The building that stands now was originally built between 1760 and 1769 to the designs of the architect John Smyth (who was also responsible for the interior of St Werburgh's Church, among other works in Dublin at the time).Archiseek.com - Architecture of Dublin In 1803 the church was the site of Robert Emmet's execution - and a plaque commemorating this remains today.RobertEmmet.org - Dublin Images - Plaque Into the 20th century, the Protestant population of the Liberties area of the city declined, and the church closed in September 1966. It was de-consecrated the following year. St. Catherine's was transferred for a number of years to Dublin Corporation, and was used for exhibitions and concerts - hosting artists such as Christy Moore and The Chieftains. It fell disused in the 1980s however, and the interior was vandalised.Excavations.ie - Database of Irish excavation reports - St. Catherine's In 1990 Dublin Corporation offered the church for sale as part of an inner city development plan. An Anglican group (City Outreach for Renewal and Evangelism - CORE) took on the refurbishment of the church in 1993, and the interior was largely restored by the end of 1998. In early November 1998 St. Catherine's was reconsecrated and has been an active place of worship since then. Church architecture A noted authority on Dublin architecture, Maurice Craig,TimesOnline wrote that St. Catherine's has \\"the finest fa√ßade of any church in Dublin\\".Irish Times - Thu 9 Sep 2000 - \\"Restoring faith in St Catherine's\\" Its fa√ßade is built of mountain granite and has in the centre four Doric semi-columns supporting a pediment, and at the extremities coupled pilasters. Originally a spire was intended, but this was not completed due to lack of funds. Internally, St. Catherine's is a galleried church (a type common in Dublin from the late 17th century) Architects Curdy and Mitchell restored the church in 1877 and during the following decade an interior reordering was undertaken by architect James Franklin Fuller, during which the old box pews were replaced with open ones. The crypt contains the remains of several Earls of Meath. Christopher Plunkett, 2nd Earl of Fingall, fatally wounded at the Battle of Rathmines, was buried in St Catherine's in August 1649.

Florida National Group was acquired in 1990 by First Union Corporation, which was renamed Wachovia in 2001. History =Early years= Samuel Hubbard's Mercantile Exchange Bank eventually became Florida National BankFlorida Times-Union: December 10, 2005-Pioneering Hubbard family's name is still remembered in Jacksonville by LENI BESSETTE AND LOUISE STANTON WARREN after Jacksonville's Great Fire of 1901. Millionaire Alfred I. du Pont acquired a major interest in the FNB shortly after moving to Jacksonville in the mid-1920s, but he was unable to gain control until the Great Depression struck in 1929. The FNB stayed solvent throughout the 1930s because du Pont put $15 million of his own money into the institution to cover Bank runs.Florida Department of State: Great Floridians 2000 Program- Jacksonville During the early 1930s, six other Florida National Banks were opened throughout Florida, including Lakeland and Bartow; Alfred's wife, Jessie Ball du Pont was named a director of the bank. When Alfred du Pont died in 1935, the du Pont Trust, managed by Ed Ball, Jessie du Pont's brother, continued to control the bank. Growth continued with the acquisition of many more Florida banks over the next two decades and became known as the Florida National Group, which was one of the strongest banks in the state. In size, the branches eventually numbered 185, second only in Florida to Barnett Bank.New York Times: March 8, 1989-First Union to Acquire Florida National Bank by Michael Quint Ball built the Florida National Bank building at 214 North Hogan Street in Jacksonville in 1961. The structure was constructed using materials which would appreciate in value, such as marble floors and granite exteriors, but excluded items that Ball considered frills. There were no executive washrooms and no hot water faucets in the entire eleven story edifice. The corporate offices of the group were housed in the upper floors and the bank's principal location was on the ground floor. Ed Ball also kept his personal office there for managing the du Pont Trust. After Ball's death, the structure was renamed the Edward Ball Building. Congress forced the du Pont Trust to divest itself of banking interests when they withdrew the trust's 15-year exemption from the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956.New York Times: March 11, 1979-Ed Ball at 91: Embattled, Implacable by Jon Nordheimer The trust sold 34.7% ownership in Florida National Banks to Charter Company in 1971 for $42M, leaving the du Pont Trust with 24.9%, below the legal definition of a bank holding company. The CEO of Charter was Raymond Mason, a prot√©g√© of Ed Ball. Additionally, Ed Ball personally owned 6.4% of FNB and was executor of his sister's estate, which owned 4.5% of FNB.New York Times: June 13, 1971-Florida Banker at Bay On July 9, 1973, the Federal Reserve Board issued a preliminary determination that the du Pont Trust had retained enough stock that would allow the trust to continue to exert some control over the bank.New York Times: July 10, 1973-DuPont Interest in Bank Held Inadequately Divested Ball was forced to sell the trust's remaining shares and resign as chairman of FNB. However, the du Pont Trust owned a significant block of Charter stock, and the close personal relationship between Mason and Ball still allowed some indirect control. One Enterprise Center served as corporate headquarters of Florida National Bank from 1986 to 1990. =Acquisition= Southeast Banking Corporation (SBC), Florida's largest bank holding company, targeted FNB with a takeover bid in 1980, which the FNB board rejected. That same year, a group of foreign investors from Chile, Venezuela, Canada and south Florida sought 40% ownership and control of FNB. FNB filed suit in circuit court and the group was enjoined from acquiring more than 25% of the bank holding company's outstanding shares.New York Times: May 6, 1981-Company News; Florida Bank Fights To Block Takeover However, Florida National revealed in 1981 that it was willing to permit acquisition by Chemical Banking Corporation of New York City after laws preventing interstate banking were lifted.New York Times: May 20, 1982-Florida Bank's Special Meeting At the same time, C.A. Cavendes Sociedad Financiera, a Venezuelan investment company, announced that it had acquired 24.99 percent of the common stock of Florida National. In February, 1982, SBC sued to obtain an injunction against the merger in Federal court, citing contrary banking laws in both Federal and Florida codes.New York Times: February 9, 1982-Florida Bank Merger Fought Florida National Bank countered with an antitrust suit against SBC. It was FNB's contention that if SBC were allowed to complete the takeover, commercial banking competition would be unlawfully reduced.New York Times: February 17, 1982-Florida Bank Antitrust Suit In early 1983, Southeast Banking Corporation dropped its takeover attempt and agreed to exchange their 1.73 million FNB shares for 24 FNB branch offices, $5.7M in cash, a downtown Miami real estate parcel and other assets.New York Times: March 3, 1983-Southeast Banking This was during the time when Charter was going through a bankruptcy. The Federal Reserve Board approved a revised merger plan between FNB and Chemical Bank in 1984. However, at the time, interstate banking acquisitions were prohibited by Federal law and required state legislative approval.New York Times: March 2, 1984-Fed Will Accept Florida Bank Plan With the 1990 deadline running out for its option to buy FNB and no sign of state legislative approval, Chemical Bank sold their 4.9% interest to First Union for $115 million.

The Coney Island waterfront was originally subdivided among several private entities who erected barriers. Plans for a Coney Island boardwalk were first discussed in the late 1890s as a means of uniting the different sections of Coney Island, and as a revitalization project for these areas. The boardwalk, designed by Philip P. Farley, was named after Brooklyn borough president Edward J. Riegelmann, who led its construction. The Riegelmann Boardwalk's first portion opened in 1923, with further extensions in 1926 and 1941, as well as several modifications and repairs throughout the 20th century. After NYC Parks unsuccessfully attempted to repair the boardwalk with concrete in the early 21st century, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Riegelmann Boardwalk a city landmark in 2018. Description = Dimensions and materials = The Riegelmann Boardwalk stretches for from West 37th Street at the border of Coney Island and Sea Gate to Brighton 15th Street in Brighton Beach. The boardwalk is wide for most of its length, though portions in Brighton Beach are wide. It is raised above sea level to protect against storm surges, and, according to designer Philip Farley, to \\"give ample clear space under the boardwalk both longitudinally and laterally.\\" Staircases and ramps lead southward to the beach at intervals of every blocks or . Ramps also connect the boardwalk to the streets to the north. The boardwalk was built using of sand, of stone, of reinforced concrete, and of timber flooring. As part of the construction of the boardwalk, 16 rock jetties spaced at intervals of were built to prevent violent waves from crashing against the boardwalk. The current beaches are not a natural feature; the sand that would naturally replenish Coney Island is cut off by the jetty at Breezy Point, Queens. Following the boardwalk's construction, sand has been redeposited on the beaches via beach nourishment, and is held in place by around two dozen groynes. The boardwalk has a steel and concrete foundation supporting wood planking for the walkway, though much of this is no longer visible due to the beach having been raised after the boardwalk was constructed. The boardwalk is designed to handle a maximum load of . To accomplish this, Farley installed a precast concrete-girder structure under the boardwalk on the advice of J.W. Hackney, who designed Atlantic City's boardwalk. Pile bents were placed at intervals, each bent containing two bundles of four reinforced concrete piles. The piles rest on bases and extend downward . The ends of the girder structures are cantilevered outside the piles. The boardwalk's planks are set in a modified chevron design, running at 45-degree angles between two longitudinal wooden axes. The diagonal pattern was to \\"facilitate the ease of walking,\\" while the wooden axes were designed for chairs to be rolled down the boardwalk. The boardwalk was first built using Douglas fir planks from Washington state. After numerous rebuilds, sturdy hardwoods were added to the boardwalk, as were plastic and concrete. The boardwalk is also used as a bike lane between 6a.m. and 9p.m. each day, except during summers, when cycling is curtailed after 10a.m. = Amenities = Original \\"Fifth Avenue\\"-style street lights Restroom facilities, benches, and drinking fountains are located along the boardwalk's length, both on the level of the boardwalk and beneath it. Five pavilions and five pergolas were completed in 1925 by J. Sarsfield Kennedy. These no longer exist, but were designed in the Mediterranean Revival style and were characterized by \\"arched entrances, rows of Tuscan columns, corner piers, and red tile roofs.\\" \\"Comfort stations\\" or restrooms, also no longer extant, were also built below the level of the boardwalk, and were characterized by ornamental semicircular stairs and rooftop terraces that aligned with the boardwalk's elevation. Most of the shade pavilions to the south of the boardwalk were built in the 2000s and 2010s, and are elevated due to Federal Emergency Management Agency regulations, though there are also some historic pavilions from the 20th century. There are four non-functional historic cast iron fountains as well as newer, functioning steel fountains. The boardwalk's original street furnishings included 170 \\"twin-arm\\" street lights similar to those on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, posted at intervals and at street intersections. Benches that faced the ocean were installed by the J.W. Fiske Ironworks Company, but have also been replaced. = Attractions = Modern attractions on the boardwalk include Luna Park, Deno's Wonder Wheel Amusement Park, and the New York Aquarium. The boardwalk is also adjacent to MCU Park, which opened in 2001 and is the home stadium of the Brooklyn Cyclones, a Minor League Baseball team. A live performance venue, the Ford Amphitheater at Coney Island, opened on the boardwalk in 2016. Several amusement parks that formerly faced the boardwalk, including Steeplechase Park (1897‚Äì1964), the original Luna Park (1903‚Äì1944), and Astroland (1962‚Äì2008), no longer exist. There are several officially designated landmarks on the boardwalk. The Childs Restaurants building, a New York City designated landmark that is now the site of the Ford Amphitheater, opened in 1923 at West 21st Street; its terracotta facade was designed to blend in with the boardwalk's appearance. To the east is the Parachute Jump, a defunct parachute tower ride, which is both a city landmark and a National Register of Historic Places listing. The B&B; Carousell, directly beside the Parachute Jump, is the last operating carousel in Coney Island and is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Coney Island Cyclone, a wooden roller coaster built in 1927 at West 10th Street, is the only operating coaster on Coney Island from the 20th century, and is both a city and national landmark. Set inland from the boardwalk is the Wonder Wheel (built 1920), a -tall eccentric Ferris wheel that is also a recognized city landmark. Other attractions on the boardwalk include the Thunderbolt roller coaster, the Abe Stark Recreation Center, and numerous other amusement rides, shops, and restaurants. The First Symphony of the Sea, a , wall relief created by Japanese artist Toshio Sasaki, was installed along the boardwalk in 1993, outside the New York Aquarium. The relief contains depictions of waves, fish, and zygotes of marine species in terrazzo and ceramic.  Steeplechase Pier  View toward the end of the pier Steeplechase Pier is a pier located at the intersection of the boardwalk and West 17th Street, near the site of Steeplechase Park, of which the pier was originally part. It is the only remaining pier on Coney Island's beach. The pier had been built by 1904, at which point it was estimated as being long. A newspaper article from that year praised the view from the pier: \\"There is no more beautiful view around New York than the sight of the twinkling colored lights of Coney Island and its reflection in the water.\\" Steeplechase Pier was originally used by anglers and it was also used by ferry lines to Coney Island until 1932. The original Steeplechase Pier was erected by builder F.J. Kelly at an unknown date, but construction had been completed within 30 days. The pier was ceded to the city in October 1921 just before the boardwalk was constructed, and was reopened in December 1922. Several improvements, such as a proposed widening and an auditorium, were never built. Steeplechase Pier was damaged multiple times in the following years due to hurricanes, fires, and boat accidents. The most serious incident was a fire in 1957 that destroyed the pier; a larger replacement opened the next year, with a T-shaped extension at the end. The pier was rebuilt most recently in 2013 after it was damaged by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Two years after it reopened, the pier received a $3.4 million grant for a total reconstruction. History = Context = The first bridge to Coney Island was established in 1824, and this was followed five years later by the creation of the Coney Island House, a seaside resort. Due to Coney Island's proximity to Manhattan and other boroughs, and its simultaneous relative distance from the city of Brooklyn to provide the illusion of a proper vacation, it began attracting vacationers in the 1830s and 1840s, and numerous resorts were built. New railroad lines, built after the American Civil War, served Coney Island's restaurants, hotels, bathing pavilions, theaters, the waterfront, and other attractions. A series of fires in the resorts in the 1880s and 1890s opened up large tracts of land for the development of theme parks, the first of which was Sea Lion Park in 1895. By the first decade of the 20th century, it contained three competing major amusement parks (Luna Park, Dreamland, and Steeplechase Park), and many independent amusements. The beach was not accessible to the public for the most part, since it was actually the private property of beachfront lots. Starting in 1882, various lots were acquired from the village of Gravesend at unusually low prices and subdivided to private interests. Some portions of the beach contained private boardwalks, but other portions had no infrastructure, and some sections of the beach were enclosed by fences that extended into the water. In the 1890s, a private boardwalk was built to connect the hotels and bungalows in Brighton Beach and Manhattan Beach; this walk extended for nearly . George C. Tilyou, who operated various amusements in Coney Island and later consolidated them into his Steeplechase Park, built boardwalks in his resorts at both Coney Island and Rockaway Beach. Numerous privately owned piers also jutted into the water at West 5th, West 8th, and West 17th Streets. Public beach accessibility was considered almost nonexistent; in 1904, it was estimated that there would be of public beachfront on Coney Island for each of the 3.7 million residents of New York City. In 1912, the West End Improvement League of Coney Island noted that only one street, West 23rd Street, had direct public access to the beach from Surf Avenue, the southernmost west‚Äìeast artery on what was then an island. = Planning and construction = The Thunderbolt at West 15th Street Interest in creating a public boardwalk increased in the 1890s, when the formerly separate boroughs of New York City were consolidated. The economist Simon Patten, a boardwalk proponent, said that the construction of a similar boardwalk in Atlantic City, New Jersey, in the late 19th century had helped to revitalize the formerly seedy waterfront there. The New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor took a similar position. In 1897, the Board of Public Improvements and Brooklyn borough president Edward M. Grout proposed a boardwalk along the southern shore of Coney Island, between West 37th and West 5th Streets. The board and Grout expected that property owners would relinquish their waterfront plots to create a space for a boardwalk. A bill proposed in the New York State Legislature in 1901 would have had property owners pay half of the boardwalk's $350,000 construction cost. However, the bill was heavily opposed by organizations who cited the bill's language and the projected property losses as reasons for their disapproval. Ultimately, only one segment was constructed near the Seaside Park resort, between West 5th Street and Ocean Parkway. Other organizations in the 1900s would present numerous proposals to build a boardwalk, though these were mainly concerned with building a walkway over the ocean itself rather than constructing a beach or clearing the waterfront.See, for instance: * * In 1912, the West End Improvement League published a 36-page booklet about the benefits of constructing a boardwalk. This plan was endorsed by the New York City Board of Estimate, which in April 1913 approved a special committee's report on the feasibility of building such a structure. This time, almost everyone supported the proposed boardwalk, though there were disputes over whether to pay the $5 million cost through private capital or city funds. Simultaneously, in 1912, New York State sued amusement owners for taking private ownership of Coney Island's beach. A judge ruled the next year that all of the beachfront exposed at low tide actually belonged to the state. An appellate court affirmed this decision in 1916, with an exception made for part of Steeplechase Park, a plot of land granted by the state prior to the creation of the park itself. All obstructions on the beachfront were demolished in accordance with the ruling. The Coney Island‚ÄìStillwell Avenue station, completed in 1920, allowed greater access from the rest of New York City. Overcrowding became common, with up to one million people filling the island on the hottest days. In May 1921, the state legislature voted to give the city the right to acquire any uplands facing the Atlantic Ocean on Coney Island, as well as on Queens' Rockaway Peninsula west of Beach 25th Street in Far Rockaway, Queens. In preparation for this action, the city held meetings on the initial boardwalk design in 1919, approved a plan in 1920, and obtained title to the land in October 1921. A groundbreaking ceremony was hosted the same day. The actual beach improvement and boardwalk construction began in 1922. Construction was overseen by Philip P. Farley, consulting engineer for Brooklyn from 1918 to 1951. The first bents for the boardwalk structure were erected in March 1923, and the last bents were completed ten months later. Initially there was some opposition to the boardwalk's construction, and business owners unsuccessfully attempted to erect fences to prevent construction progress. Concurrently with the boardwalk improvements, Riegelmann petitioned the city to make improvements to the beach and surrounding streets to make the boardwalk easier to access. In accordance with this, sand from the seabed was used to replenish the eroded shorelines. In addition, timber bulkheads, timber groynes, and granite jetties were installed starting in August 1922. The beach could accommodate half a million people when the project was finished. = Opening and early operation = A comfort station along the boardwalk In April 1923, shortly before the boardwalk was completed, it was named after Edward J. Riegelmann, the Brooklyn borough president. Riegelmann, one of the project's main leaders, had boasted that the boardwalk would raise real estate values on Coney Island. Despite his role in the creation of the boardwalk, Riegelmann and his assistant commissioner of public works opposed naming the boardwalk after him. Nevertheless, Riegelmann praised the project, and he said that following the construction of the boardwalk, \\"poor people will no longer have to stand with their faces pressed against wire fences looking at the ocean.\\" The boardwalk was completed in three phases and originally stretched between Ocean Parkway and West 37th Street. The first section of the boardwalk, comprising the eastern section between Ocean Parkway and West 5th Street, opened in October 1922. The boardwalk was extended westward to West 17th Street in December 1922. The final section of the boardwalk, from West 17th to West 37th Street, was officially opened with a ceremony on May 15, 1923. At the time of its opening, the boardwalk was said to be wider and more expensive than the comparable boardwalks at Atlantic City, the Rockaways, and Long Beach on Long Island. After the boardwalk was completed, New York City Comptroller Charles L. Craig said that it could not be considered a \\"real boardwalk\\" without pergolas and restrooms. Accordingly, in June 1924, the New York City Board of Estimate approved the erection of five comfort stations and five \\"pergolas or pavilions within the lines of the public beach.\\" The pavilions were completed by early 1925. Another ongoing project, approved by the Board of Estimate in December 1922, was to widen, create, or open private streets that led to the boardwalk. Work began in 1923 and entailed condemning 288 lots, which contained 175 houses and portions of Steeplechase Park. Eighteen streets from West 8th to West 35th Streets were created; Surf and Stillwell Avenues were widened; and some private passageways such as West 12th Street were taken over by the city. Sewers and sidewalks were also installed. Brooklyn public officials believed that these changes would both revitalize Coney Island's shore and lessen congestion on Surf Avenue. In total, the boardwalk and related improvement projects cost $20 million (about $ million in ), of which 35% was paid through taxes, and the remainder was paid by the city. The Brighton Beach extension of the boardwalk, which would build out the boardwalk from Ocean Parkway eastward to Coney Island Avenue, was formally approved by the city's Board of Estimate in June 1925. The extension measured about long, and entailed expanding the beach and creating new paths to the boardwalk. Real estate developments were proposed as a result of the extension, which was completed by mid-1926. The $1 million extension was originally supposed to have been paid for through taxes that were levied on Coney Island property owners via tax assessments. Although some property owners objected to the assessments, they were ultimately forced to pay for the project. A similar scheme to extend the boardwalk westward, from West 37th Street to Coney Island Light, was opposed by the residents of Sea Gate, the private community through which the boardwalk would have been expanded. In June 1927, borough president James J. Byrne approved the Sea Gate extension and bought land on the Sea Gate waterfront. The following year, the bulkhead lines in Sea Gate were approved for demolition, in anticipation of the boardwalk being extended. The boardwalk extension was slated to have connected to a steamship pier operated by the Coney Island Steamship Corporation. However, the company was permanently enjoined from selling stocks and bonds in July 1930. The corporation claimed that the Brooklyn government had allocated $3 million to extend the boardwalk in December 1929, but borough president Henry Hesterberg denied having done so. The boardwalk was ultimately not extended past the fence on West 37th Street. A four-block section of the boardwalk was damaged during a fire in July 1932, but the damaged segment was rebuilt and reopened the following month. = Moses reconstruction = In 1938, the responsibility of maintaining the boardwalk was transferred to the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation (NYC Parks). Parks commissioner Robert Moses had previously criticized the condition of the Coney Island, Rockaway, and South Beach boardwalks, saying, \\"These beaches and boardwalks were never properly planned, and cannot under present conditions be properly maintained and operated.\\" In a letter to mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, Moses wrote: > The boardwalk was constructed too near the water without providing any play > areas on the north side. [...] When sand was pumped in to increase the width > of the beach, instead of obtaining good white material, the contractor was > allowed to deposit brown sand on the beach. Streets were cut through which > dead-ended at the boardwalk, and which are no good as traffic arteries and > are not proper parking spaces. The zoning ordinance was adapted to the > wishes of the property owners rather than to the requirements of the public > welfare. Brighton Beach extension, looking westward After NYC Parks took control of the boardwalk, Moses announced plans to expand it eastward to around Corbin Place in Brighton Beach, as well as to incorporate another within Brighton Beach. The expansion would allow NYC Parks to add capacity for 50,000 more visitors along the Coney Island Beach. The project involved rebuilding an stretch of the boardwalk, relocating it inland and straightening its route; this required the condemnation of 20 buildings and the demolition of the Municipal Baths at West 5th Street. In addition, in October 1938, the city acquired from developer Joseph P. Day for the proposed eastward extension. Moses's original plan had been to clear another inland of the boardwalk, but these plans were modified in 1939 in order to preserve the amusement area there. The Board of Estimate approved the modified plan in December 1939, and work commenced the following month. To provide easier access to the boardwalk, a new street at approximately the location of West 9th Street was also built. As part of the renovations, a covering of sand was placed along the entirety of the beachfront. This was accomplished using sand from the Rockaways and New Jersey. The relocated boardwalk was completed by May 1940. The same year, gray paving blocks were added at Brighton 2nd and West 2nd, 15th, 21st, 27th, and 33rd Streets, as well as Stillwell Avenue, to create firebreaks in the boardwalk. In early 1941, work started on extending the boardwalk from Coney Island Avenue to Brighton 15th Street. The extension was narrower than the rest of the boardwalk, at wide. Upon the completion of the extension, the boardwalk reached its current length of . In 1955, Moses proposed extending the boardwalk east into Manhattan Beach, connecting it to the Manhattan Beach Boardwalk. These plans were opposed by property owners there, who contended that it would bring unwanted social degradation to their community. The Board of Estimate ultimately voted against Moses's plan. = Late 20th century = View on the boardwalk, looking west at Luna Park Further work was undertaken on the boardwalk in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This included the replacement of the original street lights with replicas in the 1960s, as well as the replacement of benches, drinking fountains, pavilions, and comfort stations. Concrete and brick lifeguard towers were erected in the 1970s. By the 1960s, Coney Island was in decline due to increased crime, insufficient parking facilities, bad weather, and the post-World War II automotive boom. This culminated in the last of the three big amusement parks, Steeplechase Park, being sold off in 1965. A newspaper article noted in 1961 that between 5,000 and 10,000 people slept on the beach every night, and that the boardwalk was a common place for purse snatchings and muggings. Since the boardwalk contained a wide-open space underneath, it was a frequent location for such acts as looking up women's skirts, indecent exposure, and kissing. The boardwalk's maintenance was in active decline by the 1970s. As such, repairs on two sections of boardwalk between Brighton 1st and Brighton 15th Streets were underway by 1975. Local officials, such as then-assemblyman Chuck Schumer, and residents of the surrounding communities petitioned for the city's board of estimate to release $650,000 in funding for repairs to the boardwalk. By the 1980s, the boardwalk was in poor condition; several people had been injured after falling through rotted portions of the boardwalk, the restrooms and drinking fountains were not functioning, and the section between West 32nd and West 33rd Street had collapsed completely. In 1983, it was estimated that three-quarters of the planks were in good shape. The same year, New York City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin rated the boardwalk's quality as \\"poor\\" due to holes and nails within the deck, vacant lots adjacent to the boardwalk, broken water fountains, and filthy restrooms. In 1985, a small part of the Coney Island Beach, as well as three other city beaches and Central Park's Sheep Meadow, were designated as \\"quiet zones\\" where loud radio playing was prohibited. Subsequent repairs to the boardwalk were completed by 1987. In the early 1990s, as part of a $27 million shoreline protection project, the United States Army Corps of Engineers filled in the area under the boardwalk with sand. Afterward, the space underneath became occupied by persons who were homeless, so in 1996 the city cleared out the encampment and fenced off the space under the boardwalk. Brooklyn borough president Howard Golden said in 1997 that he would rate the boardwalk as being in a \\"B-plus\\" condition; according to Golden, the largest problems were that some rails and signs needed to be fixed. On the other hand, residents had complained the previous year that the boardwalk had loose and cracked boards, holes in the wood, and uneven pilings. City vehicles frequently used the boardwalk despite exceeding the weight limit; furthermore, NYC Parks only had three employees to maintain the boardwalk year-round, as compared to eight in 1990. NYC Parks contended that it had spent $180,000 on a recent project to repair the boardwalk and that the Brooklyn borough president's office had budgeted $20 million since 1981 to repair the boardwalk. = 21st century = Brighton Beach section of the boardwalk in 2008 NYC Parks started replanking the boardwalk with ipe wood in the late 1990s, though this was opposed by environmental groups who objected to the wood being logged from the Amazon rainforest. New comfort stations and shade pavilions were added around 2001. By 2010, the city government was renovating the boardwalk: some sections were receiving new wood planking over concrete supports, while others were being replaced entirely with concrete, which had a lower maintenance cost. However, the addition of the concrete sections was controversial. Though concrete was cheaper and did not require wood sourced from trees in the Amazon rainforest, many local residents and officials felt that the boardwalk would only be authentic if made of wood. Additionally, there was no logicistical difficulty in securing wood: at the time, the Rockaway Boardwalk was simultaneously being rebuilt in wood. After installing two small concrete sections of the boardwalk, NYC Parks proposed using a type of plastic that resembled wood. The rebuild with concrete and plastic was approved in March 2012, though wood advocates later filed a lawsuit to stop the use of concrete. The boardwalk was slightly damaged during Hurricane Sandy later that year, and the adjacent amusement parks and aquarium suffered more severe damage, as did Steeplechase Pier. Further comfort stations were added in 2013, with four modular units being delivered to West 8th, West 2nd, Brighton 2nd, and New Brighton Streets. In 2014, amid the push to rebuild the boardwalk using concrete, two local members of the City Council, Mark Treyger and Chaim Deutsch, suggested making the boardwalk a New York City landmark. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission initially rejected the application for landmark status, and later in 2014, NYC Parks commenced a project to repair the boardwalk using concrete. The decision to use concrete and plastic was again controversial, but according to NYC Parks, was necessary to repair decades of use and deterioration. On May 15, 2018, the 95th anniversary of the boardwalk's opening, the Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the boardwalk a city landmark. With that designation, the boardwalk became the city's eleventh \\"scenic landmark,\\" and as such, could not be removed. The same month, two comfort stations opened at Brighton 15th Street after several years of debate. The city government announced in November 2019 that it would spend $3.2 million to place anti-terrorism bollards at entrances to the boardwalk, as part of a larger initiative to improve safety in public areas following a deadly 2017 truck attack in Manhattan.  Cultural significance  The boardwalk outside the New York Aquarium The construction of the boardwalk opened up the beach to the millions of people that visited Coney Island in its heyday, and it became known as the area's \\"Main Street,\\" supplanting Surf Avenue in that role. A 1923 guidebook described the area as \\"the oldest, most densely crowded and most democratic\\" of all the amusement areas around New York City. The boardwalk increased international visitation to Coney Island. One French observer wrote of the boardwalk, shortly after its opening, \\"Families which cannot go to the rich watering places come in hordes on Sunday to enjoy the municipal beach. It is like the Promenade des Anglais at Nice turned over to the proletariat.\\" Another writer cited the boardwalk's completion as \\"a contributing factor in the modernizing of the Coney Island section,\\" saying that its construction had led to the development of apartment buildings on the Coney Island peninsula. The boardwalk is the setting for two large annual events. The Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest takes place every July 4 outside the original Nathan's Famous location at Surf and Stillwell Avenues near the boardwalk. Nathan's had been one of several hot dog vendors that formerly lined Coney Island. The Coney Island Mermaid Parade has taken place along the boardwalk since 1983. The parade typically occurs every June, and involves floats and costumes and a King Neptune and Queen Mermaid that are crowned at the end of each parade. As a stand-in for Coney Island, the boardwalk has also been depicted in the visual arts, music, and film. Several artworks have featured the boardwalk as a focal point, including Harry Roseland's 1930s depictions of the boardwalk and beach, as well as the 1938 lithograph The People Play-Summer by Benton Murdoch Spruance. Films have used the boardwalk as a setting or even as a plot narrative, such as Sinners' Holiday (1930), Little Fugitive (1953), Annie Hall (1977), The Warriors (1979), and Requiem for a Dream (2000). The boardwalk is also used in TV shows, including children's shows such as Dora the Explorer and sitcoms such as Seinfeld. In addition, the boardwalk has appeared in several music videos, including those by Salt-N-Pepa (1993) and Beyonc√© (2013), and has been shown in albums such as Coney Island Baby (1975).  Accolades  Ruby's and Nathan's, two longtime restaurants on the boardwalk At the time of its construction, the boardwalk was considered the most important public works project in Brooklyn since the Brooklyn Bridge, which had been completed in 1883. One newspaper described the project thus: \\"New York scientists and engineers have succeeded where King Canute failed to halt the onward march of the tides.\\" The boardwalk immediately became one of Coney Island's biggest draws after its opening. A columnist for the Brooklyn Times-Union wrote in 1932 that, so powerful was the boardwalk's effect, \\"the boardwalk and Coney Island are now synonymous.\\" In 1994, the American Shore & Beach Preservation Association recognized the boardwalk as being one of several \\"infrastructure accomplishments\\" comparable to the Catskill Watershed and Central Park. In giving the award, the ASBPA stated that the boardwalk had served people who would otherwise \\"not have access to exclusive Long Island beaches.\\" In addition, in 2018, the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the boardwalk as one of the city's \\"scenic landmarks\\" after having previously rejected it for landmark status.

Kalil House is a structure that was built by Frank Lloyd Wright in Manchester, New Hampshire, in 1955. The Usonian Automatic design of this house allowed Wright to meet the requirements of Dr. Toufic and Mildred Kalil, a professional couple. Wright used the term Usonian Automatic to describe the design of economical Usonian style houses constructed of modular concrete blocks. This house illustrates Wright's creative use of this inexpensive material. Typical of Wright's Usonian style, the Kalil house draws its beauty from simple, linear forms rather than ornamental details. Symmetrical rows of rectangular window openings give the heavy concrete a sense of airiness. The Kalil house was designed in the mid-1950s, near the end of Wright's life. The Zimmerman House was built in a very different Usonian style for Dr. Toufic Kalil's good friend and hospital colleague, Dr. Zimmerman, three lots down, on the same street, five years earlier. This house contains a living room, kitchen, two bedrooms, two baths and a study. All of the original furniture, most of which is built-in, is still intact. In September 2019, it was reported that the house would be put up for sale in October, with an asking price of $850,000.

He again fought Kidderminster in the December 1910 general election and came close to winning back his old seat.

History and background The first move to begin an historical center within the specialty of family medicine came in 1987, when Claudene Clinton, then Director of the Division of Research and Information Services for the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), suggested the need for the establishment of a repository within the AAFP to house the growing body of material relating to the founding, growth and development of the academy and of the specialty of family medicine. At its meeting in February of that year, the Board of Directors of the academy moved to establish ‚Äúa task force on the history of the American Academy of Family Physicians to determine the best way to preserve materials and documents related to the growth of the specialty.‚ÄùMinutes of the AAFP Board of Directors, February 19‚Äì22, 1987. A consultant was obtained, and after lengthy study in which detailed space, equipment and budgetary requirements were determined, the Board of Directors approved the establishment of an ‚ÄúAAFP Archives‚Äù within the Academy.‚ÄúProposal for AAFP Archives,‚Äù April 1989. Following her retirement as Director of the Division of Research and Information Services, Ms. Clinton served as the first Archivist for the archives (later renamed ‚Äúthe Archives for Family Practice‚Äù) on a contract basis with the academy. On January 1, 1992, administrative responsibility for the archives was transferred from the academy to the AAFP Foundation. Following its transfer to the foundation, a Board of Curators was created to serve in an advisory capacity to the Foundation‚Äôs Board of Trustees on the operations of the Archives.Report of the AAFP/F Library Committee to the Board of Trustees, September 20, 1992. Initially the Board was made up of 7 members (now 15) ‚Äúwho have made significant contributions to family practice; who possess a broad perspective of the discipline; who have a strong interest in its historical development; and who are familiar with all the organizations in the discipline.‚Äù In 1998, an endowment was also created for the center, to help realize the Board of Curator‚Äôs vision of a ‚Äúself-sustaining and self- supporting‚Äù entity operating within the foundation.Minutes of the AAFP Foundation Board of Trustees, October 19, 1997. By 2003, the Archives for Family Practice had evolved into the principal resource center for the collection, conservation, exhibition and study of materials relating to the history of family medicine. Besides the academy and the foundation, other family medicine organizations that contribute by placing their records into its holdings, donating to its endowment and having their members serve on its advisory board include the American Board of Family Medicine (ABFM); the Association of Departments of Family Medicine (ADFM); the Association of Family Medicine Residency Directors (AFMRD); the North American Primary Care Research Group (NAPCRG); and the Society of Teachers of Family Medicine (STFM).Center for the History of Family Medicine brochure, 2004. The collections had also evolved, growing into four separate and distinct areas: # a corporate, or organizational archives for the holdings of the seven family medicine organizations; # manuscript collections of prominent family physicians and family medicine educators and staff; # an historical research library containing books written by and about family physicians and reference materials on family medicine; and # a museum collection of medical artifacts relating to the specialty for exhibition. This rapid expansion of the Archives for Family Practice‚Äôs collections, coupled with some confusion generated by its name (which was similar to several medicine journals bearing the title ‚ÄúArchives‚Äù), gave rise to the need for a name change for the archives. Consequently, in November 2003, the Board of Curators and the AAFP/F Board of Trustees approved a new name for the facility, and on January 1, 2004, the Archives for Family Practice became the Center for the History of Family Medicine.‚ÄúDusting Off the Archives... and Other Online Coverage,‚Äù FP Report (March 2004), p. 3.Sheri Porter, ‚ÄúHistory Secure in Newly Renamed Center‚Äù FP Report (online version), Retrieved on November 10, 2008.AAFP Foundation Bulletin, Spring 2004.

The Ato Institucional N√∫mero Cinco ‚Äì AI-5 () was the fifth of seventeen major decrees issued by the military dictatorship in the years following the 1964 coup d'√©tat in Brazil. Institutional Acts were the highest form of legislation during the military regime, given that they overruled even the highly authoritarian Constitution, and were enforced without the possibility of judicial review. They were issued on behalf of the \\"Supreme Command of the Revolution\\" (the regime's leadership).Situation in Brazil. CIA analysis and full text of AI-5 Artur da Costa e Silva, President when AI-5 was put into effect. AI-5, the most infamous of all Institutional Acts, was issued by dictator Artur da Costa e Silva, president at the time on December 13, 1968.\\"Governo Baixa Novo Ato\\", Folha de S.Paulo, December 14, 1968. It resulted in the forfeiture of mandates, interventions ordered by the President in municipalities and states and also in the suspension of any constitutional guarantees which eventually resulted in the institutionalization of the torture commonly used as a tool by the State. Written by then Minister of Justice, Lu√≠s Ant√¥nio da Gama e Silva, it came as a response to earlier events such as a march of over fifty thousand people in Rio de Janeiro to protest against the murder of student Edson Lu√≠s de Lima Souto by a member of the Military Police of Rio de Janeiro, the March of the One Hundred Thousand, and the decision of the Chamber of Deputies denying authorization to prosecute Congressman M√°rcio Moreira Alves, which called Brazilians to boycott the celebrations of September 7 (Independence of Brazil). It also aimed to consolidate the ambitions of a group inside the military, known as \\"hardline\\", unwilling to give the power back to the civilians anytime soon. Consequences The immediate consequences of the AI-5 were: * The President of the Republic was given authority to order the National Congress and the State Legislative Assemblies into forced recess. This Unclassified document shows how AI-5 forced Municipal Councils to recess. This document, which was declassified, discusses how a powerful military General thought that the Congress being closed was a \\"blessing.\\" Costa e Silva used this power almost as soon as AI-5 was signed, resulting in the closure of the National Congress and all state legislatures except that of S√£o Paulo for almost a year. The power to order the National Congress into recess would be used again in 1977. * The assumption by the President of the Republic and the Governors of the States, during the periods of forced recess of the federal and state Legislatures, respectively, of the fullness of the legislative power, enabling the President and the Governors to legislate by decrees with the same force and effect as statutes passed by the legislative Chambers. This power included the power to legislate constitutional amendments. A sweeping amendment of Brazil's 1967 Constitution (already adopted under the Military Regime) was promulgated in 1969 (Constitutional Amendment number 1, also known as the 1969 Constitution, because the entire altered and consolidated text of the Constitution was re-published as part of the Amendment), under the authority transferred to the Executive Branch by the AI-5. * the permission for the federal government, under the pretext of \\"national security\\", to intervene in states and municipalities, suspending the local authorities and appointing federal interventors to run the states and the municipalities; * the preliminary censorship of music, films, theater and television (a work could be censored if it was understood as subverting the political and moral values) and the censorship of the press and of other means of mass communication; * the illegality of political meetings not authorized by the police; * the suspension of habeas corpus for crimes of political motivation. * the assumption by the President of the Republic of the power of sacking summarily any public servant, including elected political officers and judges, if they were found to be subversive or un-cooperative with the regime. This power was widely used to vacate the seats of Opposition members in the Legislative branch, so that elections would be held as usual, but the composition of the Legislature resulting from the elections would be dramatically changed by the deprivation of office of Opposition legislators, effectively transforming the Federal, State and even municipal legislatures in rubber-stamp bodies. The deprivation of office of Opposition legislators also affected the makeup of the Electoral College of the President of the Republic (under the 1967 and 1969 Constitutions, adopted under the military regime, the President was chosen by an Electoral College made up of the entire National Congress, and of delegates chosen by the State Assemblies). Thus, not only elections for the Executive Branch were indirect, but the vacancies created in the composition of the Legislative bodies affected the makeup of the Electoral College, so that it also became a rubber-stamp body of the military regime. * By passing AI-5 the dictatorship could take away anyone's political rights for up to ten years, and put the death penalty back into effect * the instant legitimacy of certain types of decrees issued by the President, that were made not liable to judicial review.

It was originally published in German in 1986. Plot summary Extinction takes the form of the autobiographical testimony of Franz-Josef Murau, the intellectual black sheep of a powerful Austrian land-owning family. Murau lives in Rome in self-exile, obsessed and angry with his identity as an Austrian, and resolves never to return to the family estate of Wolfsegg.Wolfsegg‚Äôs info card. He is surrounded by a group of artistic and intellectual friends, and intends to continue living what he calls the Italianate way. When he hears of his parents' deaths, he finds himself master of Wolfsegg and must decide its fate. Murau has cut himself off from his family and sought to establish an intellectual life as a tutor in Rome. In the first half of the novel, he reflects on the spiritual, intellectual, and moral impoverishment of his family to his Roman student Gambetti. He only has respect for his Uncle Georg, who similarly cut himself off from the family and helped Murau to save himself. In the second section, he returns to his family‚Äôs estate, Wolfsegg, for the funeral, as well as to determine the disposal of the estate, which is now in his hands. Throughout the novel, Murau talks about the void that he has created for himself via exaggeration combined with understatement. Murau then incriminates all of art in this role of unjustified absolution. To Gambetti, the \\"great\\" of \\"great art\\" was just that; when he thinks on his villa in Wolfsegg, \\"great\\" comes to mean something new: criminal art that has the power to make people pardon themselves for mortal sins. Gambetti is Murau‚Äôs collaborator. His presence provides the mirror to the society of his parents, and reveals that Murau too has established an audience for himself that unknowingly endorses his obscure tactics. He stops speaking to Gambetti in the second half of the novel because Gambetti has been an agent in Murau‚Äôs self-deception. This in turn allows Murau to write his Extinction. Imagery, style and themes In this last of his novels, Bernhard uses repetition to achieve a cathartic effect while delivering himself of a parthian shot at the very language without which his own literary achievements would have been inconceivable. There‚Äôs something utopian in this novel, underscored by the ending, where Wolfsegg‚Äôs entire estate is donated to the Jewish community of Vienna. It‚Äôs a radical and destructive utopia, a utopia that annihilates Murau himself, and which is at any rate overwhelmed by resentment and hate for his birthplace.Although it must be said that legally Bernhard was born in 1931 in Heerlen, Netherlands as an illegitimate child to Herta Fabjan (1904-1950) and the carpenter Alois Zuckerst√§tter (1905-1940). His mother had temporarily moved there to give birth and avoid scandal. But Bernhard wouldn‚Äôt be Bernhard if such a denigration, so relentless and ruthless, didn‚Äôt mutate in a vertiginous cascade of words with compulsive musical pitches of extraordinary beauty (and beautifully rendered by translator David McLintock) ‚Äì a melodic aria whose lightness sharply contrasts with the gloomy character of Murau‚Äôs proclamations. It‚Äôs this very rhythm ‚Äì an inexorable, spiralling mechanism of hyperboles and superlatives ‚Äì which confers to the narrative the specific \\"vis comica\\" so characteristic of Bernhard‚Äôs work. Exaggeration changes into grotesque, tragedy into comedy. And often within the text, one hears a long liberating laughter. \\"Everything is ridiculous when one thinks of death,\\" Bernhard wrote, and very few other contemporary authors have demonstrated how thin the line is that separates the tragic from the comic. Excerpts *In a remarkable passage, the narrator Murau, an expatriate professor based in Rome, talks about the search for his childhood in an Austrian country estate, Wolfsegg: :\\"In Rome I sometimes think of Wolfsegg and tell myself that I have only to go back there in order to rediscover my childhood. This has always proved to be a gross error, I thought. You‚Äôre going to see your parents, I have often told myself, the parents of your childhood, but all I‚Äôve ever found is a gaping void. You can‚Äôt revisit your childhood, because it no longer exists, I told myself. The Children‚Äôs Villa affords the most brutal evidence that childhood is no longer possible. You have to accept this. All you see when you look back is this gaping void. Not only your childhood, but the whole of your past, is a gaping void. This is why it‚Äôs best not to look back. You have to understand that you mustn‚Äôt look back, if only for reasons of self- protection, I thought. Whenever you look back into the past, you‚Äôre looking into a gaping void. Even yesterday is a gaping void, even the moment that‚Äôs just passed.\\" *This then prompts Murau to remember a reflection he made to his student Gambetti on the subject of exaggeration: :\\"We‚Äôre often led to exaggerate, I said later, to such an extent that we take our exaggeration to be the only logical fact, with the result that we don‚Äôt perceive the real facts at all, only the monstrous exaggeration. I‚Äôve always found gratification in my fanatical faith in exaggeration, I told Gambetti. On occasion I transform this fanatical faith in exaggeration into an art, when it offers the only way out of my mental misery, my spiritual malaise‚Ä¶With some, of course, the art of exaggeration consists in understating everything, in which case we have to say that they exaggerate understatement, that exaggerated understatement is their particular version of the art of exaggeration, Gambetti. Exaggeration is the secret of great art, I said, and of great philosophy. The art of exaggeration is in fact the secret of all mental endeavor. I now left the Huntsman‚Äôs Lodge without pursuing this undoubtedly absurd idea, which would assuredly have proved correct had I developed it. On my way to the Farm, I went up to the Children‚Äôs Villa, reflecting that it was the Children‚Äôs Villa that had prompted these absurd speculations (sic).\\" ;Book's Epigraph: > I feel death pinching me by the throat, or pulling me by the back. > --Montaigne Notes References *The Nihilism of Thomas Bernhard, by Charles W.

He died flying a BAC Lightning over the North Sea while on exchange with the Royal Air Force. September 1970 incident In September 1970, Captain Schaffner was an American exchange pilot flying BAC Lightnings with No. 5 Squadron RAF at RAF Binbrook in north-east Lincolnshire, England. Binbrook was one of the bases, along with RAF Coningsby (which flew Phantoms), that was on Quick Reaction Alert. On the evening of September 8, 1970, an object was spotted over the North Sea by radar and he was on duty so he took off to follow the object. His callsign was 'Foxtrot 94'. The object was then tracked by the early warning station at RAF Fylingdales and by the USAF radar station at Thule Air Base in Greenland and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex radar base in Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA. The Lightning planes were asked to return to their base in Leuchars, and the Phantom planes patrolled the area. At 21.30, the object was picked up on radar again heading south-west over the north of Denmark. Two Lightning planes were scrambled from RAF Leuchars, to patrol to the north-east of Aberdeen, and two Lightning planes were scrambled from RAF Coltishall. The Strategic Air Command headquarters at Offutt Air Force Base near Omaha, Nebraska was informed of the incident as well as NORAD at Cheyenne Mountain. A Shackleton maritime plane that had been patrolling the Firth of Forth then circled the area around Flamborough Head. Captain Schaffner took off from Binbrook in the Lightning plane XS894 at 22.06. He had boarded the plane whilst its fuel tanks were still being filled. The plane was armed with two Red Top air-to-air missiles. The object was flying east of Whitby and parallel to the coast. It was tracked by RAF Staxton Wold in North Yorkshire. =Removal of the crashed Lightning= On October 7, 1970, Royal Navy divers located the plane on the sea bed. The plane was recovered from the sea three months later and was remarkably intact. The canopy was closed but the body of Captain Schaffner was not found. The wreckage was taken back to RAF Binbrook for investigation. Normally this would have happened at the MOD Crash Investigation Branch, part of the Royal Aircraft Establishment (now the Air Accidents Investigation Branch) at Farnborough. =September 2014 magazine contribution= In a letter to the aviation magazine FlyPast a retired RAF Sqn Ldr states that his aircraft (Avro Shackleton Mk.III WR981) was the 'Object' tracked by the various radar stations, and the incident was part of a much larger TACEVAL (station TACtical EVALuation) exercise. Two Lightnings were involved. The first made four approaches on the Shackleton, before departing the area while the second started an approach (flown by Capt Schaffner), before breaking off to Starboard. It never re-established contact and the Shackleton crew assumed that it had returned to base, until they were alerted by Uxbridge Centre on the guard frequency, requesting that they begin a search and rescue operation using the call sign Playmate 51.FlyPast September 2014 Page 102 References External links * BBC Inside Out September 2002 Category:1941 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Aviators killed in aviation accidents or incidents in the United Kingdom Category:United States Air Force officers Category:Victims of aviation accidents or incidents in 1970 ","title":"William Schaffner"},{"id":"20096305","text":"Matunuck is a village in South Kingstown, Rhode Island, United States near Charlestown, Rhode Island.

Ward (born March 3, 1968, in Selah, Washington) is a retired American Champion jockey and a current trainer in Thoroughbred horse racing. Background Ward grew up in the horse racing industry, being the son of trainer Dennis Ward. Riding career In 1984, Wesley Ward was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Apprentice Jockey following a season in which he won riding championships at Aqueduct Racetrack, Belmont Park, and the Meadowlands Racetrack and rode 335 winners. He went on to compete at racetracks in Italy, Malaysia and Singapore before his battles with weight gain led to retirement in 1989. Training career Wesley Ward turned to training, first as an assistant to his father before going out on his own in 1991. He earned his first stakes win as a trainer in 1994 at Hollywood Park, winning the Cinema Handicap. Based in California, he also races at Gulfstream Park in Florida during the winter months. He has had 3 children, Riley Ward, Denae Ward, and Jackson Ward. On June 16, 2009, Ward became the first U.S.-based conditioner to ship a horse to England and win a stakes race at the prestigious Royal Ascot meeting. Strike the Tiger, a 2-year-old gelding co- bred and co-owned by Ward, shocked the meet by taking the Windsor Castle Stakes at odds of 33-1. The following day, Ward sent out a 2-year-old filly named Jealous Again to claim an even bigger Ascot victory. She took the Group 2 Queen Mary Stakes by a comfortable five lengths. Ward also suffered setbacks at that Ascot meeting‚Äî4-year-old Cannonball was sixth in the Group 1 King's Stand Stakes, and juveniles Yogaroo (Norfolk Stakes-G2), Aegean (Albany Stakes-G3) and Honor in Peace (Chesham Stakes) were also-rans in their events. But Cannonball was wheeled back on four days' rest, almost unheard of in American racing circles, and ran second in the Golden Jubilee Stakes (Gr. 1). In 2013 Ward scored a further Royal Ascot success when No Nay Never won the Group 2 Norfolk Stakes, and a first European Group 1 win when the same horse won the Prix Morny at Deauville in August. In 2014, Ward scored his fourth Royal Ascot victory with Hootenanny, in the Windsor Castle stakes over 23 other horses by four lengths. At the 2014 Breeders Cup, Ward scored his first victory with Hootenanny in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Turf. One day later, Ward scored his second victory with Judy the Beauty in the Breeders' Cup Filly & Mare Sprint. 2015 brought a fifth Royal Ascot success when Ryan Moore rode Acapulco to win the Queen Mary Stakes, giving Ward his second victory in that race. At the 2017 Royal Ascot meeting, Ward trainee Con Te Partiro took the Sandringham Handicap at odds of 20-1 ridden by Jamie Spencer.

Throughout the German occupation of Poland, many Poles rescued Jews from the Holocaust, in the process risking their lives ‚Äì and the lives of their families. Poles were, by nationality, the most numerous persons who rescued Jews during the Holocaust. To date, ethnic Poles have been recognized by the State of Israel as Righteous among the Nations ‚Äì more, by far, than the citizens of any other country. The Home Army (the Polish Resistance) alerted the world to the Holocaust through the reports of Polish Army officer Witold Pilecki, conveyed by Polish government-in-exile courier Jan Karski. The Polish government-in-exile and the Polish Secret State pleaded, to no avail, for American and British help to stop the Holocaust. The rescue efforts were aided by one of the largest resistance movements in Europe, the Polish Underground State and its military arm, the Home Army. Supported by the Government Delegation for Poland, the most notable effort dedicated to helping Jews was spearheaded by the ≈ªegota Council, based in Warsaw, with branches in Krak√≥w, Wilno, and Lw√≥w. Polish rescuers were hampered by the murderous conditions of the German occupation. Any kind of help to Jews was punishable by death, for the rescuer and the rescuer's family. Of the estimated 3 million non-Jewish Poles killed in World War II, thousands were executed by the Germans solely for saving Jews. Background Before World War II, 3,300,000 Jewish people lived in Poland ‚Äì ten percent of the general population of some 33 million. Poland was the center of the European Jewish world. The Second World War began with the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939; and, on 17 September, in accordance with the Molotov-Ribbentrop agreement, the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east. By October 1939, the Second Polish Republic was split in half between two totalitarian powers. Germany occupied 48.4 percent of western and central Poland.Piotr Eberhardt (2011), Political Migrations on Polish Territories (1939‚Äì1950). Polish Academy of Sciences; Stanis≈Çaw Leszczycki Institute, Monographies; 12, pp. 25‚Äì29; via Internet Archive. Racial policy of Nazi Germany regarded Poles as \\"sub-human\\" and Polish Jews beneath that category, validating a campaign of unrestricted violence. One aspect of German foreign policy in conquered Poland was to prevent its ethnically diverse population from uniting against Germany. The Nazi plan for Polish Jews was one of concentration, isolation, and eventually total annihilation in the Holocaust also known as the Shoah. Similar policy measures toward the Polish Catholic majority focused on the murder or suppression of political, religious, and intellectual leaders as well as the Germanization of the annexed lands which included a program to resettle Germans from the Baltics and other regions onto farms, ventures and homes formerly owned by the expelled Poles including Polish Jews. The response of the Polish majority to the Jewish Holocaust covered an extremely wide spectrum, often ranging from acts of altruism at the risk of endangering their own and their families' lives, through compassion, to passivity, indifference, blackmail, and denunciation. Polish rescuers faced threats from unsympathetic neighbours, the Polish-German Volksdeutsche, the ethnic Ukrainian pro-Nazis, as well as blackmailers called szmalcowniks, along with the Jewish collaborators from ≈ªagiew and Group 13. The Catholic saviors of Jews were also betrayed under duress by the Jews in hiding following capture by the German Order Police battalions and the Gestapo, which resulted in the Nazi murder of the entire networks of Polish helpers. In 1941, at the onset of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, the main architect of the Holocaust, Reinhard Heydrich, issued his operational guidelines for the mass anti-Jewish actions carried out with the participation local gentiles. Massacres of Polish Jews by the Ukrainian and Lithuanian auxiliary police battalions followed. Deadly pogroms were committed in over 30 locations across formerly Soviet-occupied parts of Poland, including in Brze≈õƒá, Tarnopol, Bia≈Çystok, ≈Åuck, Lw√≥w, Stanis≈Çaw√≥w, and in Wilno where the Jews were murdered along with the Poles in the Ponary massacre at a ratio of 3-to-1.Ronald Headland (1992), Messages of Murder: A Study of the Reports of the Einsatzgruppen of the Security Police and the Security Service, 1941‚Äì1943. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ. Press, pp. 125‚Äì126. . National minorities routinely participated in pogroms led by OUN- UPA, YB, TDA and BKA. Local participation in the Nazi German \\"cleansing\\" operations included the Jedwabne pogrom of 1941. The Einsatzkommandos were ordered to organize them in all eastern territories occupied by Germany. Less than one tenth of 1 per cent of native Poles collaborated, according to statistics of the Israeli War Crimes Commission. Rudolf Weigl, Polish Righteous whose vaccines, smuggled into the Lw√≥w and Warsaw Ghettos, saved countless Jewish lives. Ethnic Poles assisted Jews by organized as well as by individual efforts. Many Poles offered food to Polish Jews or left it in places Jews would pass on their way to forced labor. Other Poles directed Jewish ghetto escapees to Poles who could help them. Some Poles sheltered Jews for only one or a few nights; others assumed full responsibility for their survival, fully aware that the Germans punished by summary execution those (as well as their families) who helped Jews. A special role fell to Polish physicians who saved thousands of Jews. Dr. Eugeniusz ≈Åazowski, known as the \\"Polish Schindler\\", saved 8,000 Polish Jews in Rozwad√≥w from deportation to death camps by simulating a typhus epidemic. Dr. Tadeusz Pankiewicz gave out free medicines in the Krak√≥w Ghetto, saving an unspecified number of Jews. Professor Rudolf Weigl, inventor of the first effective vaccine against epidemic typhus, employed and protected Jews in his Weigl Institute in Lw√≥w; his vaccines were smuggled into the Lw√≥w and Warsaw Ghettos, saving countless lives. Dr. Tadeusz Kosibowicz, director of the state hospital in Bƒôdzin, was sentenced to death for rescuing Jewish fugitives (but the sentence was commuted to camp imprisonment, and he survived the war). Those who took full responsibility for Jews' survival, perhaps especially, merit recognition as Righteous among the Nations. 6,066 Poles have been recognized by Israel's Yad Vashem as Polish Righteous among the Nations for saving Jews during the Jewish Holocaust, making Poland the country with the highest number of such Righteous. =Statistics= The number of Poles who rescued Jews from the Nazi German persecution would be hard to determine in black-and-white terms, and is still the subject of scholarly debate. According to Gunnar S. Paulsson, the number of rescuers that meet Yad Vashem's criteria is perhaps 100,000 and there may have been two or three times as many who offered minor help; the majority \\"were passively protective.\\" In an article published in the Journal of Genocide Research, Hans G. Furth estimated that there may have been as many as 1,200,000 Polish rescuers. Richard C. Lukas estimated that upwards of 1,000,000 Poles were involved in such rescue efforts, \\"but some estimates go as high as three million.\\" Lukas also cites W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski, a wartime member of ≈ªegota, as having estimated that \\"at least several hundred thousand Poles ... participated in various ways and forms in the rescue action.\\" Elsewhere, Bartoszewski has estimated that between 1 and 3 percent of the Polish population was actively involved in rescue efforts; Marcin Urynowicz estimates that a minimum of from 500,000 to over a million Poles actively tried to help Jews. The lower number was proposed by Teresa Prekerowa who claimed that between 160,000 and 360,000 Poles assisted in hiding Jews, amounting to between 1% and 2.5% of the 15 million adult Poles she categorized as \\"those who could offer help.\\" Her estimation counts only those who were involved in hiding Jews directly. It also assumes that each Jew who hid among the non-Jewish populace stayed throughout the war in only one hiding place and as such had only one set of helpers. However, other historians indicate that a much higher number was involved. Paulsson wrote that, according to his research, an average Jew in hiding stayed in seven different places throughout the war. The Kr√≥l family of Polish Righteous west of Nowy SƒÖcz Ghetto hid Jewish friends in the attic for three years. In close proximity, the Germans carried out mass executions of civilians. An average Jew who survived in occupied Poland depended on many acts of assistance and tolerance, wrote Paulsson. \\"Nearly every Jew that was rescued, was rescued by the cooperative efforts of dozen or more people,\\" as confirmed also by the Polish-Jewish historian Szymon Datner. Paulsson notes that during the six years of wartime and occupation, the average Jew sheltered by the Poles had three or four sets of false documents and faced recognition as a Jew multiple times. Datner explains also that hiding a Jew lasted often for several years thus increasing the risk involved for each Christian family exponentially. Polish-Jewish writer and Holocaust survivor Hanna Krall has identified 45 Poles who helped to shelter her from the Nazis and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Szpilman, the Polish musician of Jewish origin whose wartime experiences were chronicled in his memoir The Pianist and the film of the same title identified 30 Poles who helped him to survive the Holocaust. Meanwhile, Father John T. Pawlikowski from Chicago, referring to work by other historians, speculated that claims of hundreds of thousands of rescuers struck him as inflated. Likewise, Martin Gilbert has written that under Nazi regime, rescuers were an exception, albeit one that could be found in towns and villages throughout Poland. There is no official number of how many Polish Jews were hidden by their Christian countrymen during wartime. Lukas estimated that the number of Jews sheltered by Poles at one time might have been \\"as high as 450,000.\\" However, concealment did not automatically assure complete safety from the Nazis, and the number of Jews in hiding who were caught has been estimated variously from 40,000 to 200,000. =Difficulties= ghetto in Warsaw, being constructed by Nazi German order in August 1940 Efforts at rescue were encumbered by several factors. The threat of the death penalty for aiding Jews and limited ability to provide for the escapees were often responsible for the fact that many Poles were unwilling to provide direct help to a person of Jewish origin. This was exacerbated by the fact that the people who were in hiding did not have official ration cards and hence food for them had to be purchased on the black market at high prices. According to Emmanuel Ringelblum in most cases the money that Poles accepted from Jews they helped to hide, was taken not out of greed, but out of poverty which Poles had to endure during the German occupation. Israel Gutman has written that the majority of Jews who were sheltered by Poles paid for their own up-keep, but thousands of Polish protectors perished along with the people they were hiding. There is general consensus among scholars that, unlike in Western Europe, Polish collaboration with the Nazi Germans was insignificant. However, the Nazi terror combined with inadequacy of food rations, as well as German greed, along with the system of corruption as the only \\"one language the Germans understood well,\\" wrecked traditional values. Poles helping Jews faced unparalleled dangers not only from the German occupiers but also from their own ethnically diverse countrymen including Polish-German Volksdeutsche, and Polish Ukrainians, many of whom were anti-Semitic and morally disoriented by the war. There were people, the so-called szmalcownicy (\\"shmalts people\\" from shmalts or szmalec, slang term for money), who blackmailed the hiding Jews and Poles helping them, or who turned the Jews to the Germans for a reward. Outside the cities there were peasants of various ethnic backgrounds looking for Jews hiding in the forests, to demand money from them. There were also Jews turning in other Jews and ethnic Poles in order to alleviate hunger with the awarded prize. The vast majority of these individuals joined the criminal underworld after the German occupation and were responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people, both Jews and the Poles who were trying to save them. According to one reviewer of Paulsson, with regard to the extortionists, \\"a single hooligan or blackmailer could wreak severe damage on Jews in hiding, but it took the silent passivity of a whole crowd to maintain their cover.\\" He also notes that \\"hunters\\" were outnumbered by \\"helpers\\" by a ratio of one to 20 or 30. According to Lukas the number of renegades who blackmailed and denounced Jews and their Polish protectors probably did not number more than 1,000 individuals out of the 1,300,000 people living in Warsaw in 1939. Public execution of Micha≈Ç Kruk and several other ethnic Poles in Przemy≈õl as punishment for helping Jews, 1943 Michael C. Steinlauf writes that not only the fear of the death penalty was an obstacle limiting Polish aid to Jews, but also antisemitism, which made many individuals uncertain of their neighbors' reaction to their attempts at rescue. Number of authors have noted the negative consequences of the hostility towards Jews by extremists advocating their eventual removal from Poland. Meanwhile, Alina Cala in her study of Jews in Polish folk culture argued also for the persistence of traditional religious antisemitism and anti-Jewish propaganda before and during the war both leading to indifference. Steinlauf however notes that despite these uncertainties, Jews were helped by countless thousands of individual Poles throughout the country. He writes that \\"not the informing or the indifference, but the existence of such individuals is one of the most remarkable features of Polish-Jewish relations during the Holocaust.\\" Nechama Tec, who herself survived the war aided by a group of Catholic Poles, noted that Polish rescuers worked within an environment that was hostile to Jews and unfavorable to their protection, in which rescuers feared both the disapproval of their neighbors and reprisals that such disapproval might bring. Tec also noted that Jews, for many complex and practical reasons, were not always prepared to accept assistance that was available to them. Some Jews were pleasantly surprised to have been aided by people whom they thought to have expressed antisemitic attitudes before the invasion of Poland. Underground Biuletyn Informacyjny announcing death sentence by Kedyw and the execution of named individuals who blackmailed Polish villagers hiding Jews, July 1943. Former Director of the Department of the Righteous at Yad Vashem, Mordecai Paldiel, wrote that the widespread revulsion among the Polish people at the murders being committed by the Nazis was sometimes accompanied by an alleged feeling of relief at the disappearance of Jews. Israeli historian Joseph Kermish (born 1907) who left Poland in 1950, had claimed at the Yad Vashem conference in 1977, that the Polish researchers overstate the achievements of the ≈ªegota organization (including members of ≈ªegota themselves, along with venerable historians like Prof. Madajczyk), but his assertions are not supported by the listed evidence. Paulsson and Pawlikowski wrote that wartime attitudes among some of the populace were not a major factor impeding the survival of sheltered Jews, or the work of the ≈ªegota organization. The fact that the Polish Jewish community was destroyed during World War II, coupled with stories about Polish collaborators, has contributed, especially among Israelis and American Jews, to a lingering stereotype that the Polish population has been passive in regard to, or even supportive of, Jewish suffering. However, modern scholarship has not validated the claim that Polish antisemitism was irredeemable or different from contemporary Western antisemitism; it has also found that such claims are among the stereotypes that comprise anti-Polonism. The presenting of selective evidence in support of preconceived notions have led some popular press to draw overly simplistic and often misleading conclusions regarding the role played by Poles at the time of the Holocaust. =Punishment for aiding the Jews= Announcement of death penalty for Jews captured outside the Ghetto and for Poles helping Jews In an attempt to discourage Poles from helping the Jews and to destroy any efforts of the resistance, the Germans applied a ruthless retaliation policy. On 10 November 1941, the death penalty was introduced by Hans Frank, governor of the General Government, to apply to Poles who helped Jews \\"in any way: by taking them in for the night, giving them a lift in a vehicle of any kind\\" or \\"feed[ing] runaway Jews or sell[ing] them foodstuffs.\\" The law was made public by posters distributed in all cities and towns, to instill fear. The imposition of the death penalty for Poles aiding Jews was unique to Poland among all German occupied countries, and was a result of the conspicuous and spontaneous nature of such an aid. For example, the Ulma family (father, mother and six children) of the village of Markowa near ≈Åa≈Ñcut ‚Äì where many families concealed their Jewish neighbors ‚Äì were executed jointly by the Nazis with the eight Jews they hid. The entire Wo≈Çyniec family in Romaszka≈Ñce was massacred for sheltering three Jewish refugees from a ghetto. In Maciu≈Ñce, for hiding Jews, the Germans shot eight members of J√≥zef Borowski's family along with him and four guests who happened to be there. Nazi death squads carried out mass executions of the entire villages that were discovered to be aiding Jews on a communal level. In the villages of Bia≈Çka near Parczew and Sterdy≈Ñ near Soko≈Ç√≥w Podlaski, 150 villagers were massacred for sheltering Jews. In November 1942, the Ukrainian SS squad executed 20 villagers from Berecz in Wo≈Çy≈Ñ Voivodeship for giving aid to Jewish escapees from the ghetto in Povorsk. According to Peter Jaroszczak \\"Micha≈Ç Kruk and several other people in Przemy≈õl were executed on September 6, 1943 (pictured) for the assistance they had rendered to the Jews. Altogether, in the town and its environs 415 Jews (including 60 children) were saved, in return for which the Germans killed 568 people of Polish nationality.\\" Several hundred Poles were massacred with their priest, Adam Sztark, in S≈Çonim on 18 December 1942, for sheltering Jewish refugees of the S≈Çonim Ghetto in a Catholic church. In Huta Stara near Buczacz, Polish Christians and the Jewish countrymen they protected were herded into a church by the Nazis and burned alive on 4 March 1944. In the years 1942‚Äì1944 about 200 peasants were shot dead and burned alive as punishment in the Kielce region alone. Entire communities that helped to shelter Jews were annihilated, such as the now-extinct village of Huta Werchobuska near Z≈Çocz√≥w, Zahorze near ≈Åachwa, Huta Pieniacka near Brody or Stara Huta near Szumsk. Additionally, after the end of the war Poles who saved Jews during the Nazi occupation very often became the victims of repression at the hands of the Communist security apparatus, due to their instinctive devotion to social justice which they saw as being abused by the government. Richard C. Lukas estimated the number of Poles killed for helping Jews at about 50,000. Jews in Polish villages A number of Polish villages in their entirety provided shelter from Nazi apprehension, offering protection for their Jewish neighbors as well as the aid for refugees from other villages and escapees from the ghettos. Postwar research has confirmed that communal protection occurred in G≈Çuch√≥w near ≈Åa≈Ñcut with everyone engaged, as well as in the villages of G≈Ç√≥wne, Ozork√≥w, Borkowo near Sierpc, DƒÖbrowica near Ulan√≥w, in G≈Çupianka near Otwock, and Teresin near Che≈Çm. In Cisie near Warsaw, 25 Poles were caught hiding Jews; all were killed and the village was burned to the ground as punishment. Jerzy and Irena Krƒôpeƒá rescued over 30 Jews on their farms in Go≈ÇƒÖbki and set up homeschooling for all children, Christian and Jewish together The forms of protection varied from village to village. In Go≈ÇƒÖbki, the farm of Jerzy and Irena Krƒôpeƒá provided a hiding place for as many as 30 Jews; years after the war, the couple's son recalled in an interview with the Montreal Gazette that their actions were \\"an open secret in the village [that] everyone knew they had to keep quiet\\" and that the other villagers helped, \\"if only to provide a meal.\\" Another farm couple, Alfreda and Boles≈Çaw Pietraszek, provided shelter for Jewish families consisting of 18 people in Ceran√≥w near Soko≈Ç√≥w Podlaski, and their neighbors brought food to those being rescued. Two decades after the end of the war, a Jewish partisan named Gustaw Alef-Bolkowiak identified the following villages in the Parczew-Ostr√≥w Lubelski area where \\"almost the entire population\\" assisted Jews: Rudka, Jedlanka, Makoszka, Ty≈õmienica, and B√≥jki. Historians have documented that a dozen villagers of Mƒôt√≥w near G≈Çusk outside Lublin sheltered Polish Jews. In some well-confirmed cases, Polish Jews who were hidden, were circulated between homes in the village. Farmers in Zdzieb√≥rz near Wyszk√≥w sheltered two Jewish men by taking turns. Both of them later joined the Polish underground Home Army. The entire village of Mulawicze near Bielsk Podlaski took responsibility for the survival of an orphaned nine-year- old Jewish boy. Different families took turns hiding a Jewish girl at various homes in Wola Przybys≈Çawska near Lublin, and around Jab≈Ço≈Ñ near Parczew many Polish Jews successfully sought refuge. Impoverished Polish Jews, unable to offer any money in return, were nonetheless provided with food, clothing, shelter and money by some small communities; historians have confirmed this took place in the villages of Czajk√≥w near Stasz√≥w as well as several villages near ≈Åowicz, in Korzeni√≥wka near Gr√≥jec, near ≈ªyrard√≥w, in ≈Åaskarzew, and across Kielce Voivodship. In tiny villages where there was no permanent Nazi military presence, such as DƒÖbrowa Rzeczycka, Kƒôpa Rzeczycka and Wola Rzeczycka near Stalowa Wola, some Jews were able to openly participate in the lives of their communities. Olga Lilien, recalling her wartime experience in the 2000 book To Save a Life: Stories of Holocaust Rescue, was sheltered by a Polish family in a village near Tarnobrzeg, where she survived the war despite the posting of a 200 deutsche mark reward by the Nazi occupiers for information on Jews in hiding. Chava Grinberg-Brown from Gmina Wiskitki recalled in a postwar interview that some farmers used the threat of violence against a fellow villager who intimated the desire to betray her safety. Polish-born Israeli writer and Holocaust survivor Natan Gross, in his 2001 book Who Are You, Mr. Grymek?, told of a village near Warsaw where a local Nazi collaborator was forced to flee when it became known he reported the location of a hidden Jew. Nonetheless there were cases where Poles who saved Jews were met with a different response after the war. Antonina Wyrzykowska from Janczewko village near Jedwabne managed to successfully shelter seven Jews for twenty-six months from November 1942 until liberation. Some time earlier, during the Jedwabne pogrom close by, a minimum of 300 Polish Jews were burned alive in a barn set on fire by a group of Polish men under the German command. Wyrzykowska was honored as Righteous among the Nations for her heroism, but left her hometown after liberation for fear of retribution. Jews in Polish cities Irena Sendler smuggled 2,500 Jewish children out of the Warsaw Ghetto to safety. In Poland's cities and larger towns, the Nazi occupiers created ghettos that were designed to imprison the local Jewish populations. The food rations allocated by the Germans to the ghettos condemned their inhabitants to starvation. Smuggling of food into the ghettos and smuggling of goods out of the ghettos, organized by Jews and Poles, was the only means of subsistence of the Jewish population in the ghettos. The price difference between the Aryan and Jewish sides was large, reaching as much as 100%, but the penalty for aiding Jews was death. Hundreds of Polish and Jewish smugglers would come in and out the ghettos, usually at night or at dawn, through openings in the walls, tunnels and sewers or through the guardposts by paying bribes. The Polish Underground urged the Poles to support smuggling. The punishment for smuggling was death, carried out on the spot. Among the Jewish smuggler victims were scores of Jewish children aged five or six, whom the German shot at the ghetto exits and near the walls. While communal rescue was impossible under these circumstances, many Polish Christians concealed their Jewish neighbors. For example, Zofia Baniecka and her mother rescued over 50 Jews in their home between 1941 and 1944. Paulsson, in his research on the Jews of Warsaw, documented that Warsaw's Polish residents managed to support and conceal the same percentage of Jews as did residents in other European cities under Nazi occupation. Ten percent of Warsaw's Polish population was actively engaged in sheltering their Jewish neighbors. It is estimated that the number of Jews living in hiding on the Aryan side of the capital city in 1944 was at least 15,000 to 30,000 and relied on the network of 50,000‚Äì60,000 Poles who provided shelter, and about half as many assisting in other ways. Jews outside Poland Poles living in Lithuania supported Chiune Sugihara producing false Japanese visas. The refugees arriving to Japan were helped by Polish ambassador Tadeusz Romer. Henryk S≈Çawik issued false Polish passports to about 5000 of Jews in Hungary. He was killed by Germans in 1944. = ≈Åado≈õ Group = The ≈Åado≈õ Group also called the Bernese Group (Aleksander ≈Åado≈õ, Konstanty Rokicki, Stefan Ryniewicz, Juliusz K√ºhl, Abraham Silberschein, Chaim Eiss) was a group of Polish diplomats and Jewish activists who elaborated in Switzerland a system of illegal production of Latin American passports aimed at saving European Jews from Holocaust. Ca 10.000 Jews received such passports, of which over 3000 have been saved. The group efforts are documented in the Eiss Archive. Organizations dedicated to saving Jews ≈ªegota members at 3rd anniversary of Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, Poland Several organizations dedicated to saving Jews were created and run by Christian Poles with the help of the Polish Jewish underground. Among those, ≈ªegota, the Council to Aid Jews, was the most prominent. It was unique not only in Poland, but in all of Nazi-occupied Europe, as there was no other organization dedicated solely to that goal. ≈ªegota concentrated its efforts on saving Jewish children toward whom the Germans were especially cruel. Tadeusz Piotrowski (1998) gives several wide- range estimates of a number of survivors including those who might have received assistance from ≈ªegota in some form including financial, legal, medical, child care, and other help in times of trouble. The subject is shrouded in controversy according to Szymon Datner, but in Lukas' estimate about half of those who survived within the changing borders of Poland were helped by ≈ªegota. The number of Jews receiving assistance who did not survive the Holocaust is not known. Perhaps the most famous member of ≈ªegota was Irena Sendler, who managed to successfully smuggle 2,500 Jewish children out of the Warsaw Ghetto. ≈ªegota was granted over 5 million dollars or nearly 29 million z≈Ç by the government-in-exile (see below), for the relief payments to Jewish families in Poland. Besides ≈ªegota, there were smaller organizations such as KZ-LNP≈ª, ZSP, SOS and others (along the Polish Red Cross), whose action agendas included help to the Jews. Some were associated with ≈ªegota. Jews and the Church Mother Matylda Getter rescued between 250 and 550 Jewish children from the Warsaw Ghetto. Polish priest Marceli Godlewski was recognized as Righteous among the Nations in 2009. The Roman Catholic Church in Poland provided many persecuted Jews with food and shelter during the war, even though monasteries gave no immunity to Polish priests and monks against the death penalty. Nearly every Catholic institution in Poland looked after a few Jews, usually children with forged Christian birth certificates and an assumed or vague identity. In particular, convents of Catholic nuns in Poland (see Sister Bertranda), played a major role in the effort to rescue and shelter Polish Jews, with the Franciscan Sisters credited with the largest number of Jewish children saved. Two thirds of all nunneries in Poland took part in the rescue, in all likelihood with the support and encouragement of the church hierarchy. These efforts were supported by local Polish bishops and the Vatican itself. The convent leaders never disclosed the exact number of children saved in their institutions, and for security reasons the rescued children were never registered. Jewish institutions have no statistics that could clarify the matter. Systematic recording of testimonies did not begin until the early 1970s. In the villages of O≈ºar√≥w, Ignac√≥w, Szyman√≥w, and Grodzisko near Le≈ºajsk, the Jewish children were cared for by Catholic convents and by the surrounding communities. In these villages, Christian parents did not remove their children from schools where Jewish children were in attendance. Irena Sendler head of children's section ≈ªegota (the Council to Aid Jews) organisation cooperated very closely in saving Jewish children from the Warsaw Ghetto with social worker and Catholic nun, mother provincial of Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary - Matylda Getter. The children were placed with Polish families, the Warsaw orphanage of the Sisters of the Family of Mary, or Roman Catholic convents such as the Little Sister Servants of the Blessed Virgin Mary Conceived Immaculate at Turkowice and Chotom√≥w. Sister Matylda Getter rescued between 250 and 550 Jewish children in different education and care facilities for children in Anin, Bia≈Ço≈Çƒôka, Chotom√≥w, Miƒôdzylesie, P≈Çudy, Sejny, Vilnius and others. Getter's convent was located at the entrance to the Warsaw Ghetto. When the Nazis commenced the clearing of the Ghetto in 1941, Getter took in many orphans and dispersed them among Family of Mary homes. As the Nazis began sending orphans to the gas chambers, Getter issued fake baptismal certificates, providing the children with false identities. The sisters lived in daily fear of the Germans. Michael Phayer credits Getter and the Family of Mary with rescuing more than 750 Jews. Historians have shown that in numerous villages, Jewish families survived the Holocaust by living under assumed identities as Christians with full knowledge of the local inhabitants who did not betray their identities. This has been confirmed in the settlements of Bielsko (Upper Silesia), in Dziurk√≥w near Radom, in near Czƒôstochowa, in Korzeni√≥wka near Gr√≥jec, in ≈Åaskarzew, Sobolew, and Wilga triangle, and in several villages near ≈Åowicz. Some officials in the senior Polish priesthood maintained the same theological attitude of hostility toward the Jews which was known from before the invasion of Poland. After the war ended, some convents were unwilling to return Jewish children to postwar institutions that asked for them, and at times refused to disclose the adoptive parents' identities, forcing government agencies and courts to intervene. See also: Jews and the Polish government The Mass Extermination of Jews in German Occupied Poland: the 1942 report by the Polish government-in-exile addressed to the wartime allies of the United Nations Lack of international effort to aid Jews resulted in political uproar on the part of the Polish government in exile residing in Great Britain. The government often publicly expressed outrage at German mass murders of Jews. In 1942, the Directorate of Civil Resistance, part of the Polish Underground State, issued the following declaration based on reports by the Polish underground: The Polish government was the first to inform the Western Allies about the Holocaust, although early reports were often met with disbelief, even by Jewish leaders themselves, and then, for much longer, by Western powers. Holocaust resistor Witold Pilecki Witold Pilecki was a member of the Polish Armia Krajowa (AK) resistance, and the only person who volunteered to be imprisoned in Auschwitz. As an agent of the underground intelligence, he began sending numerous reports about the camp and genocide to the Polish resistance headquarters in Warsaw through the resistance network he organized in Auschwitz. In March 1941, Pilecki's reports were being forwarded via the Polish resistance to the British government in London, but the British government refused AK reports on atrocities as being gross exaggerations and propaganda of the Polish government. Similarly, in 1942, Jan Karski, who had been serving as a courier between the Polish underground and the Polish government in exile, was smuggled into the Warsaw Ghetto and reported to the Polish, British and American governments on the terrible situation of the Jews in Poland, in particular the destruction of the Ghetto. He met with Polish politicians in exile, including the prime minister, as well as members of political parties such as the Polish Socialist Party, National Party, Labor Party, People's Party, Jewish Bund and Poalei Zion. He also spoke to Anthony Eden, the British foreign secretary, and included a detailed statement on what he had seen in Warsaw and Be≈Ç≈ºec. In 1943 in London, Karski met the well-known journalist Arthur Koestler. He then traveled to the United States and reported to U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In July 1943, Jan Karski again personally reported to Roosevelt about the plight of Polish Jews, but the president \\"interrupted and asked the Polish emissary about the situation of... horses\\" in Poland. He also met with many other government and civic leaders in the United States, including Felix Frankfurter, Cordell Hull, William J. Donovan, and Stephen Wise. Karski also presented his report to the news media, bishops of various denominations (including Cardinal Samuel Stritch), members of the Hollywood film industry, and artists, but without success. Many of those he spoke to did not believe him and again supposed that his testimony was much exaggerated or was propaganda from the Polish government in exile. Last page \\"Raczy≈Ñski's Note\\" - official note of Polish government-in-exile to Anthony Eden 10 December 1942. The supreme political body of the underground government within Poland was the Delegatura. There were no Jewish representatives in it. Delegatura financed and sponsored ≈ªegota, the organization for help to the Polish Jews ‚Äì run jointly by Jews and non-Jews. Since 1942 ≈ªegota was granted by Delegatura nearly 29 million zlotys (over $5 million; or, 13.56 times as much, in today's funds) for the relief payments to thousands of extended Jewish families in Poland. The government-in-exile also provided special assistance including funds, arms and other supplies to Jewish resistance organizations (like ≈ªOB and ≈ªZW), particularly from 1942 onwards. The interim government transmitted messages to the West from the Jewish underground, and gave support to their requests for retaliation on German targets if the atrocities are not stopped ‚Äì a request that was dismissed by the Allied governments. The Polish government also tried, without much success, to increase the chances of Polish refugees finding a safe haven in neutral countries and to prevent deportations of escaping Jews back to Nazi- occupied Poland. Diplomat Henryk S≈Çawik helped save Jews with false Polish passports. Polish Delegate of the Government in Exile residing in Hungary, diplomat Henryk S≈Çawik known as the Polish Wallenberg,Grzegorz ≈Åubczyk, Trybuna 120 (3717), 24 May 2002. helped rescue over 30,000 refugees including 5,000 Polish Jews in Budapest, by giving them false Polish passports as Christians. He founded an orphanage for Jewish children officially named School for Children of Polish Officers in V√°c. Archiwum dzia≈Çalno≈õci Prezydenta RP w latach 1997‚Äì2005. BIP.Maria Zawadzka, \\"Righteous Among the Nations: Henryk S≈Çawik and J√≥zsef Antall.\\" Museum of the History of Polish Jews. Warsaw, 7 October 2010. See also: \\"The S≈Çawik family\\" (ibidem). Accessed 3 September 2011. With two members on the National Council, Polish Jews were sufficiently represented in the government in exile. Also, in 1943 a Jewish affairs section of the Underground State was set up by the Government Delegation for Poland; it was headed by Witold Bie≈Ñkowski and W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski. Its purpose was to organize efforts concerning the Polish Jewish population, to coordinate with Zegota, and to prepare documentation about the fate of the Jews for the government in London. Regrettably, the great number of Polish Jews had been killed already even before the Government-in-exile fully realized the totality of the Final Solution. According to David Engel and Dariusz Stola, the government-in-exile concerned itself with the fate of Polish people in general, the re-recreation of the independent Polish state, and with establishing itself as an equal partner amongst the Allied forces. On top of its relative weakness, the government in exile was subject to the scrutiny of the West, in particular, American and British Jews reluctant to criticize their own governments for inaction in regard to saving their fellow Jews. The Polish government and its underground representatives at home issued declarations that people acting against the Jews (blackmailers and others) would be punished by death. General W≈Çadys≈Çaw Sikorski, the Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces, signed a decree calling upon the Polish population to extend aid to the persecuted Jews; including the following stern warning. According to Michael C. Steinlauf, before the Warsaw Ghetto uprising in 1943, Sikorski's appeals to Poles to help Jews accompanied his communiques only on rare occasions. Steinlauf points out that in one speech made in London, he was promising equal rights for Jews after the war, but the promise was omitted from the printed version of the speech for no reason. According to David Engel, the loyalty of Polish Jews to Poland and Polish interests was held in doubt by some members of the exiled government, leading to political tensions. For example, the Jewish Agency refused to give support to Polish demand for the return of Lw√≥w and Wilno to Poland. Overall, as Stola notes, Polish government was just as unprepared to deal with the Holocaust as were the other Allied governments, and that the government's hesitancy in appeals to the general population to aid the Jews diminished only after reports of the Holocaust became more wide spread. Szmul Zygielbojm, a Jewish member of the National Council of the Polish government in exile, committed suicide in May 1943, in London, in protest against the indifference of the Allied governments toward the destruction of the Jewish people, and the failure of the Polish government to rouse public opinion commensurate with the scale of the tragedy befalling Polish Jews. Clandestine poster warning of death penalty for blackmailing and turning in Jews, ≈ªegota 1943. Poland, with its unique underground state, was the only country in occupied Europe to have an extensive, underground justice system. These clandestine courts operated with attention to due process (although limited by circumstances), so it could take months to get a death sentence passed. However, Prekerowa notes that the death sentences by non-military courts only began to be issued in September 1943, which meant that blackmailers were able to operate for some time already since the first Nazi anti-Jewish measures of 1940. Overall, it took the Polish underground until late 1942 to legislate and organize non-military courts which were authorized to pass death sentences for civilian crimes, such as non-treasonous collaboration, extortion and blackmail. According to Joseph Kermish from Israel, among the thousands of collaborators sentenced to death by the Special Courts and executed by the Polish resistance fighters who risked death carrying out these verdicts, few were explicitly blackmailers or informers who had persecuted Jews. This, according to Kermish, led to increasing boldness of some of the blackmailers in their criminal activities. Marek Jan Chodakiewicz writes that a number of Polish Jews were executed for denouncing other Jews. He notes that since Nazi informers often denounced members of the underground as well as Jews in hiding, the charge of collaboration was a general one and sentences passed were for cumulative crimes. The Home Army units under the command of officers from left-wing Sanacja, the Polish Socialist Party as well as the centrist Democratic Party welcomed Jewish fighters to serve with Poles without problems stemming from their ethnic identity. However, some rightist units of the Armia Krajowa excluded Jews. Similarly, some members of the Delegate's Bureau saw Jews and ethnic Poles as separate entities. Historian Israel Gutman has noted that AK leader Stefan Rowecki advocated the abandonment of the long-range considerations of the underground and the launch of an all-out uprising should the Germans undertake a campaign of extermination against ethnic Poles, but that no such plan existed while the extermination of Jewish Polish citizens was under way. On the other hand, the pre-war Polish government armed and trained Jewish paramilitary groups such as Lehi and ‚Äì while in exile ‚Äì accepted thousands of Polish Jewish fighters into Anders Army including leaders such as Menachem Begin. The policy of support continued throughout the war with the Jewish Combat Organization and the Jewish Military Union forming an integral part of the Polish resistance.

A user of this program would likely provide input that gives an expected response in most situations. However, if the user does in fact innocently provide the pre-defined input, invoking the internal functionality, the program response is often quite unexpected to the user (thus appearing \\"magical\\").  Background  Typically, the implementation of magic strings is due to time constraints. A developer must find a fast solution instead of delving more deeply into a problem and finding a better solution. For example, when testing a program that takes a user's personal details and verifies their credit card number, a developer may decide to add a magic string shortcut whereby entering the unlikely input of \\"***\\" as a credit card number would cause the program to automatically proceed as if the card were valid, without spending time verifying it. If the developer forgets to remove the magic string, and a user of the final program happens to enter \\"***\\" as a placeholder credit card number while filling in the form, the user would inadvertently trigger the hidden functionality.  Resolution  = Situations/issues of cause = Often there are significant time constraints out of the developer's control right from the beginning of their involvement in a project. Common issues that might lead to this anti-pattern as a result: * Null != null or any variation where a data type doesn't compare bitwise to a supposedly identical type. This is an issue that can even occur within the same development environment (same programming language and compiler). This problem has a long history for numerical and boolean types and most compilers handle this well (with applicable warnings and errors, default resolution, etc...). Nullable types such as strings have the difficulty of historically different definitions for NULL. The errors/warnings produced are often general or a 'best fit' default error whose message does not actually describe what's going on. If the developer can't get enough clues to track the issue down through debugging, taking a short cut, and coding in a 'default' string, may be the only way to keep the project on schedule. One solution to this may be the application of the Null Object pattern.Eric Freeman, Elisabeth Freeman, Kathy Sierra, Bert Bates; 2004, Head First Design Patterns, 1st ed., O'Reilly, Chapter 6, pg. 214, The Command Pattern, , * Programmed into a corner. Sometimes a design seems straightforward and even simple but turns out to have a logical flaw, dependent upon the possible user inputs, due to an often unforeseen circumstance towards the end of planned development. Thus a developer might feel the need to implement a user input with special security/operational allowances to deal with such circumstances. This can be particularly ironic since it will sometimes become obvious that a more robust design from the beginning would likely have left room to handle the flaw. However this would perhaps have taken too much time to implement and it might have conflicted with the fundamental engineering concept of KISS, keeping a design and implementation simple and meeting only the initial necessary requirements. * Allowing external access to a global flag. Over-confidence that a global flag can never be set accidentally or maliciously (often a quite reasonable assumption) justifies such implementation for testing and debug purposes, especially for small applications with simple interfaces. If the distribution of the program is considerable however, it is usually just a matter of time before somebody sets the flag. An obvious solution is to never use a global variable in such a manner. A developer might also make the flag circumstantially accessible. So the magic string by itself would be dealt with by the program as any other input.Andrew Cumming; 2007, SQL Hacks, 1st ed., O'Reilly, pg. 174, Prevent an SQL Injection Attack, , The user has to then reproduce the setting as well as produce some collection of other events, that the user interface discreetly allows, for the flag to accept the setting; a far more unlikely scenario, though still possible. = Strict formatting = Restricting the format of the input is a possible maintenance (bug fixing) solution. Essentially, this means validating input information to check that it is in the correct format, in order to reduce the possibility of the magic string being discovered by the user. Examples include validating a telephone number to ensure that it contains only digits (and possibly spaces and punctuation to a limited extent) or checking that a person's name has a forename and a surname (and is appropriately capitalised). An exception is made for the magic string in the validation code so that it will not be rejected by validation. It is expected that, since a user would likely quickly notice the strict enforcement of formatting, it would likely not occur to the user to try inputting a string not conforming to the format. Therefore, it is very unlikely for the user to try the magic string. As with any input validation process, it is important to ensure that the format is not restrictive in a way that unintentionally restricts the use of the application by some users. An example of this is restricting telephone number or postal codeBrian Knight, Allan Mitchell, Darren Green, Douglas Hinson, Kathi Kellenberger; 2005, Professional SQL server 2005 integration services, 1st ed., John Wiley and Sons, Chapter 5, pg. 129, Handling Dirty Data, , input based on one country's system (e.g. requiring every user to give a five-digit ZIP code), causing problems for legitimate users who are based in other countries.  Purposeful implementation  As is often the case with anti- patterns, there exists specific scenarios where magic strings are a correct solution for an implementation. Examples include cheat codes and Easter eggs. Furthermore, there are cases when users invent magic strings, and systems that have not coded to accept them can produce unexpected results such as missing license plates.https://www.snopes.com/autos/law/noplate.asp See also * Magic number (programming) * Time formatting and storage bugs, for problems that can be caused by magics * Sentinel value (aka flag value, trip value, rogue value, signal value, dummy data) * Canary value, special value to detect buffer overflows * Video games cheat codes which have the same origin * XYZZY (command) References Category:Anti-patterns ","title":"Magic string"},{"id":"20096375","text":"Rafael Carmona (born October 2, 1972 in R√≠o Piedras, Puerto Rico) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher for the Seattle Mariners.

He was himself a medical writer and was regarded as a second Galen. Biography Montanus was born in Verona, and became a friend of the pioneering anatomist Andreas Vesalius.Burgersdijk & Niermans Auction catalogue, number 318, lot 1445, online and archived.

Licensed to Georgetown, Ohio, United States, the station is owned by Dreamcatcher Communications. History The station was assigned the call letters WIAO on June 15, 1981. On October 16, 1981 the station changed its call sign to the current WRAC. WRAC was founded and placed on the air by Virginia Purdy as part of the Ohio River Broadcasting Association (ORBA). The studios started out with its creme and blue colors scheme, in a converted barn/garage on Virginia's personal property in West Union. The transmitter was placed on Spencer Mountain, roughly 10 miles west of West Union and one mile north of the pan handle. Gene Bowen (formerly of WURD provided much of the logistical help in getting the station on the air. The studios and transmitter site were furnished with state-of-the-art equipment. The station was one of the first in the area to originate high fidelity remote broadcasts using link backs by transmitter rather than conventional phone lines. The first primary hosts were Virginia Purdy (morning talk), Gene Bowen (morning drive), Phil Swayne (lunch block), Ted Foster (evenings) and Dan Ramey (afternoons). Jeff Hall and Jeff Scott (King) joined soon afterward. Jeff Hall replacing Dan Ramey afternoons, and Jeff Scott providing engineering support, remote broadcast setup and vacation fill-in support. Jeff Scott later worked stints in morning drive and lunch block. Gene Bowen, Jeff Hall, and Jeff Scott left successful previous positions at WURD to join WRAC. Gene Bowen, Phil Swayne, Jeff Hall, and Jeff Scott have since left the station to pursue careers outside of radio. (Gene Bowen has since died.) The station started out playing an eclectic blend of top hits in pop, country, and adult contemporary. Bluegrass segments were later added on the weekend and subsequently to weekday evenings. The station was known for its community involvement stemming primarily from the founders interest in politics. Virginia herself maintained a tight grip on the public persona of the station by banning content that she felt was unacceptable for the public airwaves. At her request, the playing of the song \\"Jack and Diane\\" by John Cougar was banned, as one early example. She also hosted regular morning talk segments on relevant topics with the movers and shakers of the area. At her direction, the station, early on known as the bridge across the Ohio, maintained a presence at every festival and celebration in the surrounding Southern Ohio and Northern Kentucky markets. As Virginia became ever more involved in educational politics, her day to day influence and interest in the station began to wane. Early on, the station had no nickname, at the strict direction of the owner. WRAC was always only referred to as WRAC in jingles and promos; never with any taglines or nicknames. Internally the \\"RAC\\" in WRAC was always thought to stand for Radio Adams County. Management felt this too restrictive and never permitted its use on the air. An early \\"on the air\\" promotion entitled \\"Make Maggie Moo\\" became so popular that when the station was later sold and the format changed to top country, Maggie remained to become the station mascot, and the station is now known as C103 \\"The Home of the Cow\\". Current owners Don and Venita Bowles have operated the station under the parent company DreamCatcher Communications since 1997. WRAC C103 is one of four stations in southern Ohio and northern Kentucky owned and operated by DreamCatcher Communications. The others include - WAOL-FM 99.5 The Edge, licensed to Ripley, OH; WFLE-FM and WFLE-AM out of Flemingsburg, KY. C103 now plays Top 40 Country plus top hits from the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. The primary on-air hosts today are Brad Rolfe and Rosie Young (The Brad & Rosie Show). The show has generated very high ratings in the past several years and is now the number one morning show in the area. Longtime afternoon host Ted Foster retired in April 2010. This position was taken over by Matt Hilderbrand in May 2010. Hilderbrand has since become a popular personality in the area. Rolfe and Hilderbrand also share hosting duties of \\"The Trash and Treasure Trading Post\\", a long-standing call in show for the station. In September 2015, the station added a third on-air personality in Brian Elliot. As a result, The Brad and Rosie Show extended to a four-hour show, running from 6am to 10am. Brad Rolfe rounds out the morning show from 10am to 11am. Brian Elliot handles the midday shift from 11am to 4pm. Matt Hilderbrand moved to the afternoon drive slot and is on the air from 4pm to 8pm. C103 now broadcasts in digital from a new tower and transmitter located in Russelville, Ohio. C103 studios are still located in West Union, Ohio. C103 is not only a country music radio station but also serves the community by broadcasting from area festivals, fairs, community events plus C103 broadcasts high school sports. C103 airs over 150 Southern Hills Athletic Conference basketball games a year, as well as high school baseball and volleyball, Ohio University football, dirt track and NASCAR Sprint Cup racing.

Licensed to Ashland, Ohio, United States, the station serves the North-Central Ohio area and is the only radio station located within the city limits of Ashland. The station is owned and operated by Ashland University (formerly Ashland College). Its studios are located in the Center for The Arts building (formerly Arts & Humanities, or A&H;). The transmitter and its antenna are located in the top floor of the library. WRDL is Ashland University's award-winning, student-run radio station, broadcasting Top 40 hits and more to those in and around Ashland 24-hours a day. With a primary listening radius of about , WRDL is \\"committed to bringing Ashland County its local news, sports, and information.\\" 88.9 WRDL can also be heard in 10 counties in North-Central Ohio, and is committed to being our listeners go-to source for the latest Top 40 hits and more.

For information about Ashland University's Journalism and Digital Media program, visit http://www.ashland.edu/jdm. History WRDL began broadcasting from tiny studios in a former projection booth for a theater in Founder's Hall in 1966. Originally at 88.1 on the dial, the 10-watt station's transmitter was located atop Clayton Hall, the tallest dormitory on the campus. Later the frequency was moved to 89.5 to avoid conflicts with other nearby non-commercial educational stations. In the 1980s the power was increased to 3,000 watts, and the station dial position was moved to 88.9. The transmitter was moved atop the new campus library building. The station gets its call letters from the initials of Richard Dean Leidy, an adjunct professor that founded the radio/television department, at what was then called Ashland College. He always modestly insisted the letters stood for \\"Radio Department Laboratory.\\" Leidy led the department from 1960 to 1988, when he retired. Most students were seeking majors or minors in the AC Speech Department. The earliest equipment consisted of a Collins tube-type control board and two 16-inch transcription turntables of 1950's vintage. Additional tube-type equipment caused frequent high temperatures in the tiny control room without air- conditioning. In the earliest days, the station signed off in the summer, and only broadcast during the September to June school year. In the mid-1960s some of the earliest student DJs consisted of Charles Beekley, Tom Warner, Mike Rogers and Craig Whitmore. They were quickly joined by Les Bagley, Tony \\"Z\\" Zabilski, Pat Murray, Ken Krauss, Jay Pappas, Mark Koontz and Will Ruch and others. Even with only 10 watts, the station became very popular in the community and student DJs were invited to do \\"record hops\\" at area high schools, and to appear at community events. One of the most visible was the annual three-day remote broadcast from a downtown tent to promote donations to benefit the American Cancer Society. Charles G. (Charlie) Beekley graduated in 1966 and was hired as Mr. Leidy's first assistant instructor. \\"CGB,\\" as he was familiarly known, was succeeded in the early 70s by others including Jay Pappas. Early guest lecturers included Eric Severeid of CBS News and Byron MacGregor, news director of the then highly popular CKLW Radio. The school began offering Radio/Television as a major in the late-1960s when facilities were modernized and expanded with a move to custom designed facilities in the new Arts & Humanities Building. New studio equipment included a state-of-the- art Altec Lansing audio board and other late model radio gear as well as a well-equipped television production studio and control room. A United Press International news teletype was installed and Les Bagley was appointed the station's first designated student News Director. WRDL and ACTV2 newscasts were simulcast, and along with some other campus-originated programming (including remote broadcasts from the Ashland County Fair and live coverage of City Council meetings) were used as \\"local content\\" on the city's Armstrong Cable television system. WRDL programming was also simulcast on AM through a low-power carrier-current system that transmitted through the campus power lines. In the early 1970s, the station's personalities included Gary Fletcher, Dean Dallman, Don King, Marty Larsen, \\"Kirk the Jerk\\" Fegley and Scott Rankin's \\"Get Up and Go Show.\\" Later in the 70s and early 80s, the station's music hosts included Tripp Rogers, Bob Spence, John Hager, Mike Marchinuke, Pete Moore, John (the Bear) Carroll, Doug Kurkul, Mike Parker, Michelle Temple, Tim (Shadow) Morris, Keith Connors, BJ McCurdy, Blair Mintz, Jeff France, and Ed Vogt. A Spanish-language show on Sundays was hosted by Jose Diaz. During this time, the station was called FM89, and later 89-Plus. The Sunday Night Special, which ran once a week for two hours, featured a different recording artist each week. Among the artists highlighted on the Sunday Night Special programs were Pink Floyd, Bob Seger, Todd Rundgren, the Doobie Brothers, Chicago, Yes, Heart, Billy Joel, Paul McCartney, and many other of the era's most popular rock acts. Airing immediately after the Sunday Night Special was an hour-long disco program, hosted by Adolph Santorine. The station also offered a weekly program featuring jazz, hosted by Mark Buchan. Jay Pappas was the faculty member responsible for WRDL radio for many of these years, and Larry Hiner for WRDL television. Bill Clinger was responsible for equipment maintenance and broadcast technical matters. In 1993, student staff adopted the nickname \\"The Eagle,\\" because it was easier to say than the call letters. The name references the university's mascot, the Eagles. This nickname quit being used sometime around 2010. As of 2016, WRDL participates annually in College Radio Day, the day in which hundreds of college radio stations from around the country celebrate the unique medium of college radio. In 2016, WRDL won Nationally recognized awards from the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS). These awards are believed to be the first awards won for WRDL from IBS in the station's 50-year history. According to an Ashland University press release, several Ashland University Journalism and Digital Media (JDM) students received finalist awards for their work with the University's radio and television stations in the national Intercollegiate Broadcasting System awards competition. ‚ÄúThe great thing about these honors is that we had finalists in both the radio and television categories in the national IBS awards competition,‚Äù said Dr. David McCoy, chair of AU's JDM department. ‚ÄúThis clearly conveys the converged media approach exhibited by JDM, as judged by blind peer reviews. Moreover, it enhances the fact the JDM is Ohio‚Äôs premiere small college/university academic media program.‚Äù The finalist trophies and the first place awards will be presented at the national convention in New York in the spring of 2017. Many of the AU nominees will be attending that convention and awards presentation. McCoy said these awards are a first for WRDL 88.9 FM in the JDM era and it is believed that is the first time for a national award notification in the 50-year history of WRDL. ‚ÄúAs the faculty advisor for the radio station, I am proud of the work of all student radio participants,‚Äù he said. Those receiving honors in the radio category were: \\\\- Best Newscast (Top 7) - The Early Bird's Word - Kate Siefert \\\\- Best Women's Basketball Play-by-Play (Top 5) - AU vs. Grand Valley State - Derek Wood & Noah Cloonan \\\\- Best Use of Facebook (Top 5) - WRDL Facebook - Derek Wood \\\\- Best Show Promotional Poster (Top 6) - WRDL - Derek Wood In 2017, WRDL participated in Vinylthon 2017, a yearly event recognized by the College Radio Foundation, encouraging college stations to play vinyl for some period of time throughout the day. In 2017, WRDL was 1 of 12 stations across the country to play vinyl for 24 straight hours, thus capturing the \\"Golden Slipmat Award.\\" In 2017, WRDL won Nationally recognized awards from the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System (IBS). Those receiving honors in the radio category were: \\\\- Best Sports Play-by-Play, Women's Basketball (Top 6) - AU National Championship Game - Noah Cloonan and Tyler Lance. WRDL won first place in this category in 2016 IBS competition. \\\\- Best Event Promo (Top 5) - AU Basketball - Tom Nesbitt \\\\- Best Station Promotional Poster (Top 6) - WRDL Tailgate Party Current Format In June 2012, WRDL began broadcasting mainstream contemporary hit radio music in an effort to increase consistency in listenership and increase the presence of the station at on-campus venues such as the recreational center, athletic event, and dining areas. The station's new positioning statement, \\"More Music, More You,\\" was designed to let listeners know that WRDL would provide them with both more music and more local content than the competition. WRDL offers local news weekday mornings and evenings and also an entertainment and local information-based morning show, \\"The Early Bird's Word,\\" which airs 7:00 am ‚Äì 9:00 am on weekdays while school is in session. The show features regular appearances from university and city authorities, including Ashland Mayor Matt Miller. In 2013, the station debuted Ashland's only hip/hop and R&B; show, \\"The Pregame,\\" which plays the latest music from the Top 40 rap, R&B;, and hip/hop charts. The show can be heard on Saturday nights from 7:00 pm ‚Äì 2:00 am Sunday morning. Beginning in 2016, WRDL began \\"Throwback Thursday,\\" which is every Thursday from 1:00 pm ‚Äì 3:00 pm. The show features music from past generations of WRDL, including the 1980s, 1990s and new millennium. Every semester, WRDL features live student-DJ's at various times throughout the day, including mornings, afternoons and evenings. Sports Coverage In the fall of 2012, WRDL scheduled to broadcast every Ashland University home football game, as well as a full slate of area high school football. In the winter, WRDL offered live broadcasts of most AU home men's and women's basketball games (games over winter break, when school was not in session, were not broadcast). As the Ashland University women's basketball team went on its national championship run, WRDL broadcast every single game, including the national tournament in San Antonio, Texas, despite not receiving any funding help from the university for the trip. WRDL also offered broadcasts of AU baseball in the spring of 2012. In the fall of 2013, WRDL expanded its Ashland University sports coverage by adding both one volleyball and one women's soccer match on a trial basis. Both broadcasts were successful, and the Eagle volleyball match received one of the largest online stream audiences in WRDL history. WRDL also broadcast a road AU football game against Walsh at the historic Fawcett Stadium in Canton, OH. WRDL also added more Eagle baseball to its sports schedule in the spring of 2014. Due to the success of the volleyball broadcast in 2013, WRDL added additional volleyball matches to the sports broadcast schedule in the fall of 2014. In total, the 2014 WRDL Sports schedule featured seven AU football games and six Ashland volleyball matches. Since 2013, WRDL has been the exclusive home for Ashland Eagle Athletics, broadcasting live from home games for AU Football, Men's and Women's Basketball, Baseball, Volleyball, and Men's and Women's Soccer. In 2016, WRDL increased their coverage for AU Volleyball, covering all home games inside Kates Gymnasium. WRDL also increased their coverage of AU Soccer, as the Men's Soccer team returned to action following a three-year hiatus. A full schedule of all WRDL Sports broadcasts can be found on the station website.

It is owned by the Swiss Alpine Club. The hut is the start of the normal route to the summit and other mountains in the area. The first hut was built in 1894‚Äì1895 just next to the then still much higher Border Glacier at an altitude of . A completely new building was inaugurated in 2009, a hi- tech, energy-wise almost self-sufficient, environmentally friendly mountain hut based on wood with an aluminium shell. Location The Monte Rosa Hut lies on the western side of Monte Rosa massif, on the place named Untere Plattje. It dominates the Grenzgletscher (Border Glacier) to the south and west, and further down the Gorner Glacier, and is surrounded by many four- thousanders, such as Dufourspitze, Liskamm, Castor, Pollux, Breithorn and Matterhorn. The hut can be reached using the Gornergratbahn; from the station Rotenboden a trail leads to the Gorner Glacier. Then the Gornergletscher has to be crossed (usually marked itinerary), then over the lower end of the Grenzgletscher, finally at around 2,600 m the trail continues directly to the hut. History Old stone-based hut (1895‚Äì2010) The first hut, known under the name Betemps hut, was built between 1894 and 1895. It had 25 beds and was owned by the Swiss Alpine Club central committee. The hut was enlarged in 1918 to host 20 more people. The Betemps hut was offered to the Monte Rosa section in 1929 then transformed and renamed Monte Rosa hut. Between 1939-1940 a new hut with 86 beds was built. The capacity was raised up to 146 in 1972 and 160 in 1984. =The new hut= Inside the new hut A new hi-tech environmentally friendly mountain hut was designed by architect Andrea Deplazes of ETH Zurich and inaugurated in September 2009. The project of the Swiss Alpine Club, to mark the 150th anniversary of ETH Zurich, was launched in 2003. The construction materials prefabricated elements were transported by train to Zermatt and 3,000 helicopter trips were needed to take 35 workers and materials up to the glacier. The five-story polygonal building was built on stainless steel foundations with a spiral interior made out of wood, the exterior being covered with an aluminium shell. The building is designed to obtain 90 percent of its power needs from the sun. Excess energy is stored in valve-regulated lead-acid battery cells, which supply power when it is overcast. Water is collected from melting glaciers and stored in a large reservoir 40 metres above the hut. Bands of windows allow the sun to heat air inside the spiral building with the redistribution of thermal energy produced by visitors. Over the next few years the hut will become a research station for the students from the ETH Zurich. They will use it to investigate how to use energy and resources efficiently.

It is located 2,600 meters above sea level. The name Almoloya comes from the Nahuatl phrase almoloy√°n which means place where water flows out. \\"del Rio\\" means \\"of the river\\" in Spanish and refers to the Lerma River, which originates here.  The town  = History = While the area had been long inhabited by hunter-gatherers, the first sedentary farming communities appeared in this area around 5000 to 1000 BC. Almoloya was founded on the edges of the marshes of Lake Chicnahuapan. In the Pre-Classic period, agriculture intensified and tribal communities began to develop. By the High Classic period, villages with ceremonial centers had developed as well as the cultivation of corn, beans and vegetables on chinampas in Lake Chicnahuapan and the Chicnahuapan River, now known as the Lerma River. The village of Almoloya was founded between 650 and 850 AD by the Otom√≠ and Matlatzinca people. The patron divinity was the Night Jaguar from the Olmec culture and the ceremonial center was called Xiut√©petl Xaxalpa. Mixcoatl conquered Almoloya del R√≠o, along with Toluca, Tenango, Malinalco and Zoquitzinco. This was part of the expansion of the Tepanec empire which included many of the peoples of the Valley of Toluca. Aztec conquest came in 1476 under leader Axayacatl putting the town under the jurisdiction of Tacuba. Later, in 1521, Spaniard Gonzalo de Sandoval took over the town along with the rest of the valley, putting it under the jurisdiction of Toluca. The Franciscans came shortly thereafter to evangelize the native population, very likely building a small, temporary church where the current church stands. In 1528, the town was part of the encomienda of Juan Guti√©rrez Altamirano, a cousin of Hern√°n Cort√©s, who had a hacienda named Ateneo. He also set up a hacienda just outside the town of Almoloya. In the 16th and 17th centuries the town church, San Miguel Arcangel was built. In the 18th century, the town of Metepec had grown sufficiently that it became a jurisdiction, which Almoloya belonged to. Viceregal authorities mandated that Indians living in scattered small communities in this valley be grouped into four larger communities; one of these communities was Almoloya By 1808, the town itself had grown sufficiently that it had jurisdiction over three other communities: San Mateo Texcalyacac, Santa Cruz Atizap√°n, Santa Mar√≠a Nativitas and San Pedro Techuchulco. During the Mexican War of Independence, Ignacio Ray√≥n's troops fought royalist troops in the fields between this town and Santiago Tianguistenco. On 26 October 1884, 300 people led by Friar Isidro Garc√≠a attacked forty evangelists killing Pastor Landa, Nicanor Gomez and Nicolas Muci√±o. In 1889, the town had a territory of 18 km2 and a population of 3,740 people. During the Mexican Revolution, the townspeople's loyalty was split between the federal government and Zapatista and other revolutionaries. In 1913, Genovevo de la O. took the town's municipal president, Apolonio V√°zquez prisoner and nearly executed him. In 1915, fighting between federalists and revolutionaries resulted in the burning of the municipal palace and the destruction of almost all of the municipality's records. A small portion was saved by Juan Hern√°ndez. Between 1914 and 1918, a series of epidemics such as typhoid and famines struck the town, resulting in the reduction of the population. Between the 1930s and 1950s a number of work projects began to divert water from the Lerma River to supply nearby Mexico City. This eventually led to the disappearance of Lake Chignahuapan. These works included an aqueduct and other actions such as dynamiting to divert the water to the city. In addition to the disappearance of the lake, this diversion has had seriously negative consequences to the Lerma River itself by blocking off the springs that feed the river. Overexploitation of these springs is also causing the dropping of water tables that will eventually cause the springs to dry up altogether. By 1995 only 55 people spoke an indigenous language and by 2005, only 31 did. As of 2005, the town had a population of 7,992 people. thumb = Notable sites = The town church, called San Miguel Arc√°ngel, is its most outstanding feature, built between the 16th and 17th centuries. It is dedicated to Our Lord of Burgos. The church faces west, towards where Lake Chignahupan was, with a view of the Nevado de Toluca. In the late 19th century, the stone wall to the north was constructed and its tower is thought to have been built around this time as well. Its bells were cast in 1947. According to sources, to achieve a better sound, many women of the town donated much of their gold jewelry. Many of the church's improvements at this time were the work of a religious fraternity called \\"La Agrupacion.\\" The church has two side naves and one main nave, at the back of which if the main altar, whose age is undetermined. Above the vestibule is the choir, which used to have a large organ. In its interior are sculptures of the Archangel Michael, Saint Augustine, Archangel Gabriel, and four of Christ. The Esmeralda Clock was made in 1926 in France with its base made in Mexico. It originally was located in Mexico City. It was given to the municipality as a token of appreciated for the sale of its water to the city. It was placed in its current position in 1940. As the town is located on the tallest hill in the municipality, the tones of this clock can be heard in the nearby communities, with many people using these chimes to mark their day. The Parque Ecotur√≠stico was inaugurated in 2007 in the marshes of the old lake. These marshes are home to a wide variety of species including a third of the bird species native to the State of Mexico. It is also a wintering ground for birds that migrate from the United States and Canada. =Economy= As the principal economic activity of the town is the production of denim clothing, every year in September is the \\"Feria de Vestido y Costura\\" (Festival of Clothing and Sewing).Garments produced include rebozos, stoles and embroidered wool skirts. Traditional garments of the region, especially those associated with the feast of Corpus Christi are a specialty as well. Many of these garments can be bought at the weekly Sunday tianguis or open-air market. Almoloya is known for mariachi bands that make their living at Plaza Garibaldi in Mexico City. The best-known of these bands are called \\"Benito Juarez\\" and \\"Miguel Hidalgo\\". =Festivals= This town celebrates Carnaval every year in honor of the Virgin of Dolores. During this celebration, folkdances such as the \\"Paseo de Locos\\" (Parade of Crazies) los \\"Vaqueros\\" (the Cowboys) las \\"Pastoras\\" (the Shepardesses) and \\" Se√±or Santiago\\" (Lord Santiago). This town is also the home of the annual \\"Biker Fantasy Fest,\\" also known as the \\"International Camping Biker\\" which started in 1994. This is a rock-and-roll and motorcyclists' event, billed as non-violent and family-friendly. The 2007 event expected 50,000 people over the three-day event. This event mostly features Mexican rock bands such as Las victimas del Dr. Cerebro, La Dolorosa, Los Gatos (band), Congal Tijuana, Pante√≥n Rococ√≥ and Maldita Vecindad. The municipality As municipal seat, the town of Almoloya del R√≠o currently has governing jurisdiction over only two other communities, Tecalco to the north of the main town and Texcoapan to the south. These two are divided into the following communities: Emiliano Zapata, El Calavario, La Puerta, Loma Linda, San Miguel, Duraznitos, Loma Alta, Florida (El Jaguey), Mirasol and Mezapa. Together the combined municipality had a population of 8,939 in 2005.It is bordered by the municipalities of Santa Cruz Atizap√°n, Santiago Tianguistenco, Texcalyacac, Xalatlaco and San Antonio la Isla. It has a territory of 6.44 square km. The topography of this small municipality consists of a hill of volcanic origin, on which the town lies, surrounded by smaller, rolling hills and the lakebed of the old Lake Chignahuapan. From here the Lerma River has its start from a number of springs that originate here. On 26 March 1847, Almoloya del R√≠o became a municipality. In 1854, the communities under its jurisdiction were San Pedro Techuchulco, San Mateo Texcalyacac, Santa Cruz Atizap√°n and the Rancho de Almoloya. However, its territory was reduced in 1866 when the municipality of Texcalyacac was erected and again in 1870 when Santa Cruz Atizap√°n separated. The area has a rainy season from April to October and a dry season from November to March with a total annual rainfall of 871.7 mm. Average temperature is about 11.7C with temperatures as high as 18C and as low as 1.5C. The principal economic activity, the production of clothing, is based on the town. Some handcrafts are produced including woven baskets for tortillas and flower arrangements. Outside the town, there is still agriculture, primarily the production of animal feed and corn on communal and ejido lands. Cattle raising is also practiced here.

Marsonek (born July 10, 1978) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher. Professional career Sam Marsonek was a 6'6\\" right handed pitcher out of Tampa, Florida. Sam was a graduate from Jesuit High School (FL) and was drafted as the 24th overall pick in the annual MLB First Player Draft in 1996, by the Texas Rangers. At the conclusion of the '99 season with the Rangers, Sam was traded to the New York Yankees in a trade deal with Brandon Knight for outfielder Chad Curtis. On July 8, 2004, after his sixth year in the Yankees organization, Marsonek was called up to the majors. Marsonek's MLB debut was July 11, 2004 where he came in to pitch in relief against the Tampa Bay Rays, his hometown team. In this outing, Marsonek pitched 1.1 innings, giving up 0 earned runs on 2 hits. In 2007, Marsonek pitched in the independent Atlantic League for the Somerset Patriots. In 35 games (14 starts), he was 6-8 with a 5.03 ERA and 59 strikeouts. Marsonek was released from the Washington Nationals in 2008, ending his 12-year professional baseball career. Coaching career After being released from his professional baseball contract, Marsonek was now searching for the next calling for his life. Sam eventually became a high school baseball coach, starting his career in Tampa, Florida at Cambridge Christian School. Marsonek spent the next four years coaching the Lancers, leading the team to two district titles, a regional championship and a state final four appearance. He was replaced by Sam Blackmon in May of 2013 after stepping down to work full-time with SCORE International. For the next few years, Score International baseball was a nationally ranked travel baseball program by Perfect Game USA. Marsonek, as the Director of SCORE International Baseball, was searching for a stable place to facilitate these outstanding players from across the world. In May 2016, Marsonek and his wife had the opportunity they were searching for; SCORE International took over Baseball Country, (formerly owned by Kenny and Angela Burns). Prior to the new position, Marsonek and his SCORE team had been bringing in missionaries along with carpentry teams to help out the area, using Baseball Country as their hub for what was already 10 years. Although there may be a change in scenery, the impact of Marsonek's coaching and directing under SCORE International baseball marked a great foundation for Baseball Country. Associated to Marsonek's coaching career is rosters filled with players from Florida, Canada, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, and the Bahamas, assisting over 85 of these players to attain a college scholarship and 27 to sign professional contracts.

Pyrus communis subsp. pyraster), also called European wild pear, is a species of pear of the family Rosaceae. This wild pear and Pyrus caucasica (syn. P. communis subsp. caucasica) are thought to be the ancestors of the cultivated European pear (Pyrus communis subsp. communis). Both the wild pears are interfertile with domesticated pears. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish Pyrus pyraster from a common pear. Pyrus pyraster can reach an age of 100 to 150 years. Description Pyrus pyraster is a deciduous plant reaching in height as medium-sized shrub and as a tree.Pignatti S. - Flora d'Italia ‚Äì Edagricole ‚Äì 1982. Vol. I, pag. 603 Unlike the cultivated form the branches have thorns. The leaves are ovate with serrated margins. The flowers have white petals. The stamens are equal to the length of styles. The flowering period extends from April through May. The fruits reach in diameter. and ripens in late Summer to early Autumn.They are quite hard and astringent, but they have a sweet taste and are edible when they are really ripe and fall from the tree. The seeds ripen in September. Under good growing conditions, wild pear trees have a remarkably slender form with a characteristic rising crown. In less favourable conditions they show other characteristic growth forms, such as one-sided or extremely low crowns. Distribution The distribution of wild pear ranges from Western Europe to the Caucasus. It does not appear in Northern Europe.Schede di Botanica The wild pear has become quite rare. It is sympatric with Pyrus elaeagrifolia. It may hybridize with other pears, producing, for example, Pyrus austriaca in a cross with Pyrus nivalis. Habitat Wild pear can grow on almost all soils, except the most acidic ones. However, owing to its weak competitive ability, the species exists mostly on extreme or marginal sites. Its tap roots enable it to grow on very dry soils. The tree requires a lot of light and is often found in the open landscape. It occurs in thickets and open woods with cool-temperate climates, in lowlands, hills and sometimes in the mountains, at above sea level. Wild pears in Britain The ‚Äúwild pears‚Äù of England and Wales are actually thought to be domesticates that escaped cultivation. They appear to be archaeophytes, with charcoal and carbonised pips having been found at several Neolithic sites and are occasionally mentioned in medieval documents. It is likely that pears spread to Britain after their domestication with early farmers and subsequently escaped into the wild. Its establishment in the British Isles is probably due to human migration, with the trees belonging to one of the Pyrus communis subspecies instead of the true wild pear species of P. pyraster, which is native to much of continental Europe but absent from Britain. Another species of pear found wild in South West England, the Plymouth pear (Pyrus cordata), is now thought to have originated from hedging plants imported from Brittany.

Gilbert based loosely on Gilbert's short story, \\"The Story of a Twelfth Cake\\", which was published in the Christmas Number of The Graphic in 1874, and elements of other Gilbert plays. The story concerns a man who, with the help of a fairy, changes a small event in his past to try to save his engagement to the girl he loves. This leads to profound changes in his present, and he finds that matters are even worse than before. Foggerty's Fairy opened at the Criterion Theatre in London on 15 December 1881. Charles Wyndham, the manager of the Criterion, starred as the lead character, Frederick Foggerty. Despite Wyndham's star power, interest in the play's bold and original premise and reviews that were at least partly positive, the play was not a success. It closed on 6 January 1882 after about 25 performances. Disappointed, Gilbert turned back to writing comic operas with Arthur Sullivan. Background W.S. Gilbert in about 1878 =Genesis= By the time Foggerty's Fairy premiered, Gilbert and Sullivan had already written half a dozen comic opera hits. Since 1877, however, Gilbert had not written a successful play apart from Sullivan. Gilbert wrote Foggerty's Fairy for British actor Edward Sothern, who had commissioned two earlier plays from Gilbert, Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith and The Ne'er-do-weel. Sothern had not been satisfied with The Ne'er-do-weel, despite various rewrites, and he refused the piece.Crowther, Andrew. \\"Foggerty's Failure\\", The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive He had already paid Gilbert for the play, and Gilbert was unable immediately to pay him back. After various discussions between Gilbert and Sothern, Gilbert agreed to let Sothern play his recent comedy success, Engaged, in America and promised to write a new play for him.Ainger, pp. 134‚Äì35 and 166 In the autumn of 1879, Sothern was on one of his lengthy American tours. He intended to open the new Gilbert play at the Park Theatre in New York in the spring of 1880. The Era wrote in October 1979 that \\"It is proposed, during Mr Sothern's [American] engagement, to bring out revivals of The Crushed Tragedian, Dundreary, and David Garrick, the new comedy by Mr Gilbert being reserved for the spring engagement.\\"The Era, Drama in America, 12 October 1879 At the same time, Gilbert was also busy rehearsing his American productions of H.M.S. Pinafore, the world premiere of The Pirates of Penzance and touring companies to play these and The Sorcerer, as well as British revivals of two of his plays. On 29 February 1880 The Era reported: \\"Mr Sothern says that, although his new comedy, by Mr Gilbert, has cost him 3,000 guineas, he would not take 6,000 guineas for it now. It is a piece of the wildest absurdity ever perpetrated, and all the parts are immense.\\"The Era, 29 February 1880 Obviously by that date Sothern had received an early version of the play and was enthusiastic about it. The same issue of The Era states that definite plans had been made for Sothern to appear at the Gaiety Theatre, London in Foggerty's Fairy, as the new play was now called, in October 1880, after the end of his American tour. Sothern did not produce the play in the spring, and scholar Andrew Crowther speculates that Gilbert was late in completing it. In addition, Sothern had been ill for much of the time since the autumn, although he fulfilled his performing commitments. Sothern came to England for a six- week holiday in June 1880, still planning to produce Foggerty's Fairy in New York.Stedman, p. 180 After one illness and a short European tour, Sothern fell seriously ill in the autumn. His health declined until he died in January 1881 never having performed the play but leaving behind a heavily annotated copy. Sothern's sister, Mary Cowan, was the beneficiary of Sothern's will. Sothern's widow contested the will, and it took Cowan until 31 May to probate it. Gilbert contacted Cowan soon after Sothern's death and offered her his help. He suggested that she \\"underlet\\" Foggerty's Fairy to him for ¬£525 and half of whatever he received for it until she had been paid 1,500 guineas. The play was first offered to comic actor J. L. Toole, but the deal fell through, and Gilbert next offered the play to actor Charles Wyndham, who was then manager of the Criterion Theatre.Ainger, pp. 193‚Äì94 After Gilbert had settled these financial dealings with Mrs. Cowan, she wrote to him: \\"Allow me to say that of all the people with whom I have had any dealings in reference to money since my Brother's death, you have treated me with the greatest kindness & fairness & I feel grateful to you for sparing me any trouble or anxiety.\\"Ainger, p. 194 Foggerty's Fairy includes a mixture of several elements that Gilbert had used in earlier work. The main device of the fairy magic, which changes a small event from the past and leads to unexpected consequences, came from a short story, \\"The Story of a Twelfth Cake\\", which Gilbert had first published in the Christmas number of The Graphic in 1874. This novel plot elements anticipates numerous fantasy and science fiction stories like Back to the Future.Cole, Sarah. \\"Foggerty's Fairy Synopsis\\", The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive Gilbert slightly modified the story and renamed it Foggerty's Fairy when he republished it in his 1890 collection of stories and essays, Foggerty's Fairy and Other Tales. Although this plot device is retained in the play, the plot of the play is almost completely changed. The device of transformation by supernatural aid is one of Gilbert's favourites.Adams, p. 528 Gilbert uses it in The Sorcerer, The Mountebanks and many of his other works. In addition, Gilbert used elements from his earlier plays The Wedding March (1873) and Tom Cobb (1875). In addition, several lines from the play appear in various Gilbert and Sullivan operas. The Ko-Ko, Nanki-Poo and Yum-Yum exchange from The Mikado, about lovers being too affectionate in front of another man who loves the woman, is used in the first act of Foggerty's Fairy. The \\"romantic\\" old lady, Malvina de Vere, is described as \\"having the remains of a fine woman about her\\", as is Ruth in The Pirates of Penzance. =Productions= By October 1881, Gilbert was rehearsing Foggerty's Fairy at the Criterion. At the opening night on 15 December 1881, Arthur Sullivan was in the audience. He found the play \\"ingenious, but unsatisfactory‚Äîlike a dream\\".Stedman, p. 189 Audience reaction was favourable enough that Gilbert took a curtain call. The critics agreed that the piece was bold and original but uneven. The idea of the parallel universes conjured by the fairy was novel and intriguing but bewildering to audiences and critics, who were required to remember the original state of affairs and compare them to the magically transformed one.Stedman, p. 190 We are used to this type of story in plays and films today, but it was unprecedented and shocking in 1881. Wyndham's performance was praised, and the play must have generated considerable interest: On 24 December, the drama critic of The Illustrated London News had not yet seen the play, but had heard that the play was \\"brilliantly successful, and will probably have a very long run; so there will be plenty of time to criticise it at leisure after the feverish pantomimic Boxing-Night week. I hear the Fairy spoken of on all sides as one of the wittiest and as the most ingenious and daring of Mr Gilbert's dramatic productions.\\" Unfortunately, he never published his review ‚Äì Fogerty's Fairy closed on 6 January 1882, before the next edition of his weekly paper. It was not a success, playing only about 25 performances.Moss, Simon. \\"Foggerty's Fairy\\" at Gilbert & Sullivan: a selling exhibition of memorabilia, c20th.com, accessed 21 November 2009 After the play's failure, Gilbert decided to concentrate on his work with Sullivan.William S. Gilbert on the Internet Movie Database Five days after it closed, Gilbert and Sullivan signed a new five-year agreement with Richard D'Oyly Carte to produce more operas together, and then they went to Sullivan's home to discuss their next piece, another work about fairies, Iolanthe. Foggerty's Fairy still receives occasional amateur productionsBerry, Simon. \\"Foggerty's Fairy\\", Daily Info, Oxford, 27 May 2006Video of 2007 production from the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival fringeReinthaler, Joan. \\"Fringe Festival: Foggerty's Fairy is a funny take on a forgotten Gilbert comedy,\\" The Washington Post, 10 July 2011 and rare professional ones.\\"Virginia City Players-Foggerty's Fairy\\", 23 June 2007, accessed 14 October 2011 Synopsis =Act I= In the Talbot drawing room, it is the morning of the marriage of Foggerty, a young pharmacist, to Jenny Talbot, a childhood friend. She will only marry a man who has never loved before because she doesn't want to \\"have a heart at second-hand\\". She was previously engaged to Foggerty's gloomy friend, Walkinshaw, but Foggerty informed her that Walkinshaw had been engaged to another woman, and so Jenny broke their engagement. Jenny's father, a \\"wholesale cheesemonger\\", and her guests do not much like Foggerty, and the best man, Walkinshaw, still bears a grudge. Foggerty has not told Jenny that he has another fianc√©e in Melbourne, Delia Spiff, a rich old woman who is a distant relative of Jenny's. Despite her wealth, however, he got cold feet and returned to London. Walkinshaw notes a newspaper report that Spiff has just arrived in England. Foggerty is afraid that Spiff will ruin his marriage, but a fairy guardian named Rebecca arrives and offers help. Foggerty wishes that Spiff did not exist. She gives Foggerty a magic elixir that will change a past event in his life. Rebecca warns him that all the consequences of any event changed by the elixir will also be changed and that this may lead to unanticipated results. He promises to use caution. She also gives him pills that he can swallow before summoning her. Now Spiff arrives and claims Foggerty in marriage. Jenny calls off the engagement, Walkinshaw is pleased, and in desperation Foggerty drinks the elixir. =Act II= Fairy Rebecca awakens Foggerty, and he finds himself in a different drawing room. As a consequence of the obliteration of Spiff, Rebecca has never met Foggerty before. He overhears Jenny's bridesmaids talking and deduces that he is about to marry Jenny. Malvina de Vere, a \\"stately lady of middle age and tragical demeanour\\" meets Jenny, now in her wedding dress. Malvina has previously had 18 lovers, all of whom had left her, though not before paying substantial damages in breach of promise lawsuits. She believes that her 19th lover is unfaithful but hopes that lover 20 will marry her. Jenny invites her to her wedding reception. It turns out that Jenny is about to marry Walkinshaw, rather than Foggerty, although she does not love him. Foggerty sees Jenny in her wedding dress and tries to kiss her, annoying Walkinshaw. After Foggerty understands the situation, he tells Jenny that he loves her. She says that she has always loved him, but he never declared his feelings, and now it is too late. He understands that, in his earlier reality, he had come together with Jenny only as a consequence of fleeing Spiff. Foggerty roughs up Walkinshaw for stealing his girl, but realises the cause and is dejected. Walkinshaw and Talbot doubt his sanity. Meanwhile, Jenny overhears Malvina calling her lawyer, who says that her 19th lover is to be married later that day, and so she is free to marry her number 20. She mentions her 19th lover's name: Walkinshaw! Jenny terminates her engagement to Walkinshaw, throwing herself into Foggerty's arms. Malvina sees Foggerty and tells him that she can marry him now ‚Äì he is lover number 20. Jenny faints, and Foggerty flees with Malvina in pursuit. =Act III= Hours later, both return to Walkinshaw's parlour, exhausted. Jenny's father has called the doctors to report that Foggerty has gone mad. He instructs Walkinshaw to keep him there until he can be hauled off to the asylum, but Walkinshaw hides from Malvina. Threatened with a suit for staggering damages, and having lost Jenny, Foggerty decides to marry Malvina. He also explains to Malvina that he has lost his memory of the past. Talbot comes back with the doctors and Blogg, an asylum attendant. Blogg is instructed to stay and watch Foggerty but not to contradict him in any way. Foggerty deduces that Blogg is a policeman, and by the time he finishes asking Blogg about the crime that he himself must have committed, he thinks that he and Walkinshaw murdered the latter's aunt. Now he believes that he will be \\"hanged first and confined in a lunatic asylum afterwards\\". He summons Rebecca using one of the pills, but she is not his fairy as a consequence of the elimination of Spiff. After some blackmailing (he has 47 pills left!), he points out some inconsistencies in the consequences of the magic. He persuades her to restore matters to their original state, but without Spiff. She does so, and the scene is transformed to daylight in the Talbot's home. All ends happily, with Foggerty to marry Jenny and Walkinshaw to marry Malvina.

The Commission‚Äôs primary objective was to maximise the number of effective child maintenance arrangements (private or statutory) in place for children who live apart from their parents. Under the 2010 UK quango reforms, the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission became the Child Maintenance Group external organisation working for the Department for Work and Pensions, who now have responsibility for its functions. Functions The Commission had three publicly stated functions: * to promote the financial responsibility that parents have for their children; * to provide information and support on the different maintenance options (Child Maintenance Options); * to provide an efficient statutory child maintenance service with effective enforcement (Child Support Agency). History During 2008, the Commission began to offer information and support on the different child maintenance options available to parents. The Commission also provided an efficient statutory child maintenance service with improved assessment, collection and enforcement processes. The new enforcement powers were introduced from 2009/10. These changes aimed to ensure parents take responsibility for providing financial support for their children where they have access to them, or indeed do not. The Commission was abolished on 30 July 2012, but despite its functions being subsumed back into the Department for Work and Pensions, the 'Child Maintenance Group' continues to operate using the client-facing brand name of the Child Support Agency for those using the 1993 and 2003 statutory schemes. The new '2012 Scheme' is branded as the Child Maintenance Service and began limited intake of new cases on 10 December 2012.

Kelly's Directory of Wiltshire of 1915Kelly's Directory of Wiltshire 1915 identifies Burton as the most important part of the parish of Nettleton. It is about west of Chippenham. There is a record of Burton dating back to AD 1204,The Place-names of Wiltshire p 81 1939 Gover, J.E.B et al. and more recently in Book 44 ‚Äì Wiltshire, of the Topographical Collections of John Aubrey, 1659‚Äì70.John Aubrey's remarks on Burton and St Mary's Church The modern community has an active Anglican church, St Mary's, and a public house, The Old House at Home. It is served by two nearby Church schools, Bybrook Valley CofE School in Yatton Keynell (4 miles) and Trinity CofE School in Acton Turville (1 mile). The Burton Community Association was founded in 2014 and is a registered charity. It has built and maintains a children's play area; it provides a defibrillator and volunteers trained in its use and in CPR; it has a group which organises activities to maintain and improve the village appearance; and a community safety and crime prevention group which operates a Community Speed Watch scheme and supports the work of the police. St Mary's Church The Church of St Mary the Virgin, which stands on the hill above the hamlet of Burton, is the oldest and most important building in the village, and is a Grade I listed building. The oldest parts of the church date from about 1290 although little remains from that period. The Register of Incumbents dates back to 1305 when the Abbot of Glastonbury presented Johannes de Montacute to the living. The Manor and Advowson of Netlington belonged, until the Dissolution, to Glastonbury Abbey. The church is now in the ByBrook Benefice in the rural deanery of Chippenham, archdeaconry of Malmesbury, and the present patron is the Bishop of Bristol. The National Association of Decorative and Fine Arts Society has published a Church RecordChurch Record for St Mary's Netteton & Burton NADFAS for St Mary's, providing an extensive and detailed formal record of the contents of the church, and many aspects of the building. The external walls of the nave and aisle date from the 14th century and in 1460 a general re-modelling of the church took place which included re-roofing the church, the building of the chancel and the erection of the north and south porches. The 15th-century tower is one of several in this area, and has a western doorway over which is a quaint stone hood forming a shallow porch. The north porch is richly vaulted within, and is surmounted externally by a panelled and battlemented parapet. On the cornice beneath are a number of grotesques to carry off the roof water: two at each side. A much- worn stoup for holy water is against the inner doorway. The door itself is the original one and still retains a large handle and escutcheon of the original ironwork. The door is fitted with a Banbury lock, the earliest form of church lock. This type of lock is one in which the lock's metal components are separately fitted into a block of wood which forms the frame. There are two keys: the smaller, possibly the older, is 230 mm long, and weighs 483g; the larger is 317mm long, weighing 858g. The south doorway is an early example of Early English work and has a curious canopied niche over the apex with flanking buttresses in which are carved two small human figures. The priest's door is in the north wall of the chancel chapel, as the rectory is on this side of the church, and has over it externally a curious little projecting hood. Above the chancel arch is a picturesque stone sanctus bell-turret with panelled sides surmounted by a short broach spirelet with foliated finial. The ceiled wagon roof is tiled in Cotswold stone. =Inside the church= The earliest feature of the church is the circular Norman font, the lower part of which is formed like a scallop-capital with fish-scale ornamentation above. The north aisle, which has three Georgian box pews, is a 14th-century copy of Norman work. The arches of the nave rest on the round columns which have sculptured capitals, all of them different. Here is a fine array of thirty or forty figures and faces below the roof and on the arches. Most are human, with a few grotesques. Some of them are corbels holding up the roof. The bench table (stone bench) on the inside of the north wall is of particular interest and probably dates from the 13th century. Most of the ancient glass was destroyed by Oliver Cromwell's men in the Fanatique Tymes, as John Aubrey put it, but some fragmentary pieces remain in the north aisle windows, mainly heraldic forms. They show Royal Arms, Scrope, Badlesmere, Dunstanville and Paulet among others. The families represented were all at one time or another associated with the manor of Castle Combe, though the Paulet arms occur all over South and West England. The 14th-century aisle terminated in line with the chancel arch. When the aisle was lengthened, the original three-light east window with reticulated tracery was reconstructed in the present 15th century east wall, and the square-headed three-light windows inserted in the north wall, and two in the south wall of the nave. Arthur Mee's description of the church in 1939The King's England : Wiltshire p 265 1939 Mee, A describes the nave as 'filled with box pews', but these have been reconstructed at some unknown date into pews of a normal height. The Royal Arms over the chancel arch, which by law after the Restoration had to be displayed, is interesting as it is in the form used by the Georges until 1801. These were the last of the Royal Arms to display the Arms of France in the second quarter. The pulpit is of stone, with 15th-century stone carving. The stone steps up to it are 600 years old. The altar is crowned with a late 19th-century reredos, which is a Doulton terracotta panel of the Last Supper by George Tinworth. The altar rails are 17th-century with vertically symmetrical balusters. There is a heraldic wall monument beside the altar with marks of lightning on it, to Samuel Arnold, a 19th-century rector for 40 years. Some restoration work was carried out in 1900 and again in the 1970s when a fire destroyed much of the work just finished. Repairs were again completed a year later. In 2009, the pews and pew platform were removed in the west end of the church, and a new stone floor laid over the earth floor underneath. This revealed that one of the beams supporting the pew platform was very old, hand carved and part painted ‚Äì possibly part of the rood screen that many churches had before the Protestant Reformation. The church possesses several pieces of silver, including a flagon, chalice, paten and paten cover, most of which dates from the 17th and 18th century. There is a First World War memorialNettleton War Memorials John Belcher commemorating: * Albert Boucher, * Percy Brookman, * E.W.Hacker, * Edwin Kent, * Arthur G.

There is a Second World War Memorial, commemorating: * George Copeland, * Sydney Edridge, * Kenneth Rawlings * Frederick Webb, * Frank Young. There are several other memorials inside the church, mainly of the incumbents and their relatives. =The church bells= The tower holds six bells which were restored and rehung by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough on a new steel frame in 1982 below the old wooden frame, displacing the old ringing chamber, thus the bells are now rung from the base of the tower. The tenor bell is c.1410, from the Worcester foundry; two others are 17th-century. The tenor bell has an unusual border. Ornamental borders of foliage or arabesques between the words or on other parts of the bell are hardly ever found on mediaeval bells. The only other instances in an English church are believed to be on the tenor at Hereford Cathedral (about 1450), and a bell at Bintry, Norfolk (about 1530).Church Bells of England, H.B Walters 1912 =In the churchyard= There are 24 listed monuments in the churchyard. These are chest tombs with a Grade II listing. Also here is the war grave of Private Edwin Kent. The Wiltshire Times of 30 October 1915 published the following report concerning Kent's death and funeral: :Died of Wounds :Great sympathy is felt in the village for Mrs E Kent and her child in the loss of their husband and father. Pte E Kent, 3rd Wilts who died of wounds received in the recent advance in Flanders Pte Edwin Kent was 32 years old when he died of wounds (shot through the spine) in hospital in Norwich. He was a native of Yatton Keynell but had lived at The Gib until he enlisted in January 1915. Before joining the Army, he had been employed by a Mr Higg, a coal merchant in Burton. Pte Kent was married and had a daughter. :Pte Edwin Kent aged 32 of the 2nd Wiltshire who was wounded whilst at the front, being shot through the spine, died in hospital in Norwich on Friday last week. He was a native of Yatton Keynell but prior to enlisting in January last, was residing at The Gibb being employed by Mr Higg, coal merchant of Burton. He leaves a widow and one little girl. :As Kent had died in hospital in England, Mrs Kent asked for the body to be buried in her local church. The local recruiting office, with the help of Lt Col Sir Audley Neeld, the Colonel steward of the Devizes depot, arranged for a military funeral. :The funeral took place on Wednesday 27 October with Rev Stafford James officiating. The funeral procession from The Gibb to Burton was headed by the band of the 2nd Wilts under Bandmaster Easton. A firing party under Sgt Bridle and Cpl Ings followed the band with their rifles reversed. At the graveside, the firing party fired three volleys and Bugler Ford sounded the \\"Last Post\\". :The mourners at the church included: :The widow and deceased daughter, Mrs Humphries (Mother), Mr H Kent ASC (in khaki) and Cpl W Kent (10th Royal Hussars) brothers, Miss E Kent (sister), Mr and Mrs J Taylor (brother in law and sister) Mr J Kent and deceased sister and her son. Others who followed included Mr and Mrs Fry and Mr Brown (Gibb), Mr and Mrs H Booy, Mr and Mrs A Booy (Castle Combe), Mr and Mrs AR Dolman (Castle Combe) Mr Higgs and Mr Hill (former employers of the late Pte Kent). :Pte Kent‚Äôs daughter was a pupil at Castle Combe school. Her fellow pupils sent 2 wreaths to the funeral. In the churchyard here are also the graves of Captain John Russell Compton Domvile (1856‚Äì1893) and Eva Kathleen Domvile (1868‚Äì1897), children of Reverend Charles Compton Domvile (1816‚Äì1898) who was Rector of St Mary's. This branch of the Domvile familyDomvile family website. is descended from Charles Pocklington Esquire M.P. who succeeded his Uncle Sir Compton, and took the Name and Arms of Domville. Notable buildings St Mary's Church is the only Grade 1 listed building in the parish. Burton Farmhouse, now known as The Old Farmhouse, is situated at the bottom of Church Hill, and is a Grade 2 listed building. It is late 17th or early 18th century. The Plume of Feathers, now known as The Old Plume, is also Grade 2 listed. It is late 17th or early 18th century. Another old building is Chestnut Cottage, which used to be the old forge. Also, part of the Old Rectory, now a private house, dates from 1605, although in common with the other old buildings, it has been substantially extended and altered over the generations. Causeway An evaluation excavation in 2005Wiltshire and Swindon Historic Environment Record ST87NW526 confirmed the presence of a causeway next to the top (east‚Äìwest) section of Church Hill, comprising several phases of stone surfacing approximately 2.6m wide, built on to a 4m wide bank of redeposited natural clay. Although limited dating evidence was recovered, the causeway appears to have been in use by the 17th century, and may well be medieval in origin. The causeway seems likely to have been used until the construction of a dry-stone wall along its centre line in the 19th or 20th century. A possible early road surface extending beneath the modern lane was also identified and, although poorly dated, its construction and use appear to have been broadly contemporary with the causeway.

Description Half-elves, as their name implies, are the offspring of humans and elves. Half-elves are a subrace unto themselves, blending the features of human and elf. Half-elves look like elves to humans and like humans to elves (hence their elven description as \\"half-human\\"). They do well with elves, humans, gnomes, dwarves, and halflings, a social ease reflected in racial bonuses to the Diplomacy and Gather Information skills. In the case of conflicts between elves and humans, however, each side suspects a half-elf mediator of favoring the other. The drow despise them, referring to them as 'Mongrel half breeds'. The main character of the initial Dragonlance series, Tanis Half-Elven, is a half-elf, as his name implies. In the Dungeons & Dragons Eberron campaign setting, half-elves consider themselves a separate people from humans and elves both and \\"breed true\\"; they bear the dragonmarks of Storm and Detection. Half-Elves have curiosity and ambitions like humans but they have sense for magic and love for nature like their elven parents. Their skin is paler than human skin and they are taller and bigger than elves. Half-Elves have long ears like elves. They live about 180 years.

Sessile organisms for which natural motility is absent are normally immobile. This is distinct from the botanical meaning of sessility, which refers to an organism or biological structure attached directly by its base without a stalk. Sessile organisms can move via external forces (such as water currents), but are usually permanently attached to something. Organisms such as corals lay down their own substrate from which they grow. Other sessile organisms grow from a solid such as a rock, dead tree trunk, or a man-made object such as a buoy or ship's hull. Mobility Sessile animals typically have a motile phase in their development. Sponges have a motile larval stage, which becomes sessile at maturity. In contrast, many jellyfish develop as sessile polyps early in their life cycle. In the case of the cochineal, it is in the nymph stage (also called the crawler stage) that the cochineal disperses. The juveniles move to a feeding spot and produce long wax filaments. Later they move to the edge of the cactus pad where the wind catches the wax filaments and carries the tiny larval cochineals to a new host. Reproduction Many sessile animals, including sponges, corals and hydra, are capable of asexual reproduction in situ by the process of budding. Sessile organisms such as barnacles and tunicates need some mechanism to move their young into new territory. This is why the most widely accepted theory explaining the evolution of a larval stage is the need for long-distance dispersal ability. Biologist Wayne Sousa's 1979 study in intertidal disturbance added support for the theory of nonequilibrium community structure, \\"suggesting that open space is necessary for the maintenance of diversity in most communities of sessile organisms.\\" Clumping Blue mussels, Mytilus edulis, are sessile and exhibit clumping Clumping is a behavior in sessile organisms, in which individuals of a particular species group closely to one another for beneficial purposes, and can be seen in coral reefs and cochineal populations. This allows for faster reproduction and better protection from predators. Predominance in coastal environments The circalittoral zone of coastal environments and biomes are dominated by sessile organisms such as oysters. Carbonate platforms grow due to the buildup of skeletal remains of sessile organisms, usually microorganisms, which induce carbonate precipitation through their metabolism. Botanical sessility In anatomy and botany, sessility refers to an organism or biological structure that has no peduncle or stalk. A sessile structure has no stalk.

Rompala (born 1947) is an American executive currently on the board of directors of the Olin Corporation. He was chairman of Valspar from February 1998 until his retirement in July 2005. He had previously served as both CEO and president of Valspar. Rompala's leadership is credited with significantly expanding Valspar's international business operations, where it had previously been a primarily North American business. Early life and education Richard Rompala was born in 1947 to a working-class family on Pittsburgh's strongly Eastern European South Side. Rompala's steelworker father eventually moved the family to Ambridge, Pennsylvania. In 1964, Rompala went to Columbia University, earning bachelor's degrees in chemistry and chemical engineering in 1969. He went on to Harvard Business School where he earned an MBA in 1975. Management work Rompala got his first management position at the Olin Corporation, running their flexible urethanes division. He left this position in 1979 to work for Victor Posner and eventually served as a senior vice president of operations at Mueller Brass. In 1985, he went to work for PPG Industries starting as a vice president of corporate development. He was eventually promoted to group vice president of chemicals and then to group vice president of resins and coatings. In 1993, PPG's chairman and CEO, Vincent Sarni was on the verge of retirement, and outside speculation suggested that Rompala was a serious contender to take his place. This, however, did not happen, and Rompala left PPG. In May 1994, Rompala was elected president of Valspar. On October 30, 1995, he assumed the position of CEO at Valspar, succeeding C. Angus Wurtele in that position. He went on to replace Wurtele as chairman in February 1998, with Wurtele staying on Valspar's board of directors. Rompala's contributions at Valspar enabled them to increase their overseas revenues from 3% in the mid-1990s to nearly 30% by 2004. Rompala accomplished this by opening joint ventures in China, Hong Kong, Brazil, South Africa and Mexico. In 1998, Rompala went to work on the Olin Corporation's board of directors, where he currently serves as the lead director and chair of the compensation committee. Rompala retired from Valspar as chairman in July 2005.

He arranged one of the first ever promotional films to be shot, in 1912, of the Rover motorcycle production and testing, ending with a sequence of him accidentally falling off his motorbike in the middle of Kenilworth ford! Many of his Rover publicity exercises, such as racing the Blue Train, passed into motoring legend. In January 1930, the Rover name hit the world press when a Rover tried to take on Le Train Bleu on its 750 mile run between Calais and Cannes. The idea of racing the Blue Train was very popular with motor enthusiasts, and each new attempt was received with varying expectations of success. Many had already failed on this mammoth challenge. The act to promote the new Rover Light Six in a headline-grabbing campaign was the brainchild of former motorcycle tester and pioneer publicist Dudley Noble, in which a Light Six was to race the Blue Train across France from Calais to St Raphael on the C√¥te d'Azur. It was a moderately shameless stunt of him, being safe in the knowledge that the average speed of the famous express was no more than about 40 mph once all its stops and detours were taken into account. To beat the train, Noble had to drive more or less non-stop from Calais to the French Riviera. The Rover Light Six averaged 38 mph on its 750 miles journey to beat the train's expected time of just over 20 hours, which gave the Rover team a 20 minute lead over the train. It had been beaten for the first time and the Rover team became celebrities through the Daily Express. In March 1930, Bentley Boy Woolf Barnato raised the stakes on Rover and its Rover Light Six having raced and beat Le Train Bleu for the first time, to better that record with his 6¬Ω Litre Bentley Speed Six on a bet of 100 Pound Sterling. He drove against the train from Cannes to Calais, then by ferry to Dover and finally London, travelling on public highways, and won; the H. J. Mulliner-bodied formal saloon he drove during the race as well as a streamlined fastback \\"Sportsman Coupe\\" by Gurney Nutting he took delivery of on 21 May 1930 became known as the Blue Train Bentleys; the latter is regularly mistaken for or erroneously referred to as being the car that raced the Blue Train, while in fact Barnato named it in memory of his race.

Jungle Captive features Otto Kruger, Amelita Ward, and Rondo Hatton (as a character named \\"Moloch\\"). Vicky Lane plays Paula Dupree the Ape Womanhttp://www.tcm.turner.com/tcmdb/title/80012/Jungle-Woman/, the lead character from the two earlier films. The film was written by Dwight V. Babcock and directed by Harold Young. Plot The film begins in the laboratory of the eminent biochemist Mr. Stendahl (Otto Kruger). As his assistants, Ann Forester (Amelita Ward) and Don Young (Phil Brown) observe, he successfully concludes an experiment to restore life to a dead rabbit. Meanwhile, at the city morgue, the misshapen Moloch (Rondo Hatton) arrives to claim the body of the now dead Ape Woman (Vicky Lane). The inquisitive attendant begins checking his credentials and is strangled for his efforts. Moloch escapes unseen with his quarry in a stolen ambulance. With the Ape Woman's body in tow, Moloch ditches the stolen vehicle over a cliff and proceeds with his own car to his final destination. He arrives at a desolate house and carries his cargo inside. The police, led by Inspector Harrigan (Jerome Cowan) manage to discover a clue, a medical smock, found near the wreckage of the ambulance. They trace it to Mr. Stendahl's lab, where Harrigan finds that it belongs to Don, making him suspicious of the young lab assistant. Ann, present during his questioning, offers a fake alibi to cover for her fianc√©. Later, Stendahl abducts Ann and transports her to his secret lab, the desolate house on Old Orchard Road that contains Moloch and the body of the Ape Woman. He plans to use a portion of Ann's blood to revive the creature. Moloch, enamored with the pretty new houseguest, becomes very protective of her. With her blood, the biochemist is successful in restoring life to the beast. In order to fully prove his theory, he knows he will need to convert her to human form. He sends Moloch to secure the records of the late Dr. Walters, which remain in the possession of Dr. Fletcher. A later dialog exchange reveals that the hapless Fletcher was killed during the theft. Armed with the recorded knowledge gathered by Dr. Walters, Stendahl utilizes glandular secretions from his captive lab assistant to complete the Ape Woman's metamorphosis. However, the brain of his subject has been damaged and possesses only animal instincts. He determines that a new brain is needed, and decides to use Ann as a donor. Stendahl departs for his downtown lab, and the now very human Ape Woman wanders away. Moloch cannot locate her on the grounds and goes to Stendahl's office in search of his boss. He finds Don there, but is informed that Stendahl is out. Don notices that Moloch is wearing a fraternity pin that he had given to Ann. He trails Moloch back to the Old Orchard Road house and is captured by Moloch and Stendahl there. After binding Don to a chair, Stendahl and Moloch attempt to locate the missing Ape Woman. While they are engaged in their search, Don frees himself and tries to escape with Ann. Stendahl and Moloch thwart his efforts and return them to the laboratory. The police make a search of Stendahl's downtown office at the Medical Building. Harrigan finds a utility bill receipt, indicating an Old Orchard Road address, paid by the biochemist. Remembering that the wrecked ambulance was discovered near there, he decides to follow up on the lead. Don, tied once again to a chair, is forced to watch as Stendahl prepares for his next operation. However, when Don explains to Moloch that the brain transplant will result in Ann's death, the once loyal henchman turns on his boss. Stendahl guns him down. Unbeknownst to the scientist, the gunfire causes the Ape Woman to revert to her beastly form. As he continues his preparations, the creature rises from the table and attacks him. With the scientist disposed of, she turns her attention toward the helpless Ann, but is in turn shot by the arriving Harrigan in the nick of time. The film ends with Don and Ann being pulled over by the police and presented with a subpoena for them to appear at the magistrate's office. A closer examination of the document reveals the purpose; to pick up their wedding gift from Harrigan.

Being mezzanines, they are always plugged on a carrier PCB that supports this format. The modules communicate with their carrier over a dedicated bus, and can have all kinds of special functions. M-Modules are standardized as ANSI/VITA 12-1996 and are especially suited for adding any kind of real-world I/O to a system in a flexible way. They are modular I/O extensions for all types of industrial computers, from embedded systems up to high-end workstations. The M-Module Interface - a fast asynchronous parallel interface - offers sophisticated functions like 32-bit data bus, burst transfers up to 100 MB/s, DMA and trigger capabilities. M-Modules also offer direct front- panel connection rather than requiring a separate adapter panel with ribbon- cable connections. This provides a clean path for sensitive signals without loss of data or signal quality - using, for example, shielded D-Sub connectors and coaxial cables. M-Module Introduction The mezzanine approach to placing multiple functions in a single card slot has been around for a long time both in proprietary and open standard forms. Valid arguments can be put forth for both of these approaches. The M-Module is one open standard that is gaining increasing popularity for applications in the fields of analog and digital I/O, instrumentation, robotics, motion functions and fieldbuses. This standard was originally developed in Germany by MEN Mikro Elektronik for VMEbus applications and was soon expanded to support the CompactPCI bus as well. It has been embraced as ANSI/VITA 12-1996. Image:M-modules-measurement- spec.jpg In addition to the single wide form shown, M-Modules can be developed in double, triple and quadruple wide configurations. Because of the standard's genesis in the VME world it is sized such that 4 fit in a 6U module and 2 in a 3U module. Conveniently, because of the way other backplane standards have evolved, 4 units easily fit the front panel space in VXI and 6U cPCI/PXI while 2 will fit in the front panel space of 3U cPCI/PXI and up to 8 will fit in a 1U LXI rack mount carrier. At the present time a number of instruments are available in the M-Module form factor in the following categories: *Pulse Generators *Function Generators *Arbitrary Waveform Generators *Digital Word Generators *Digital Multi-meters *Counter/Timers *Rubidium Sources *OCXO's *GPS Timing Receivers *Distribution Amplifiers *Precision Voltage Sources *MIL-STD-1553, CANbus, ARINC429 *Switching Modules *Serial, Analog & Digital I/O A significant advantage to the M-Module is that it has a relatively straight forward set of electrical and mechanical specifications. This enables an engineer to design a function that might be required without having to become an expert on VXI, PXI or LXI as carriers are available to allow the design to be ported to the backplane or bus of the test system in use. Supporting the Standard As with any mezzanine card, a means must be provided through which the card may be adapted to a backplane or higher level interface. Such a device is generally referred to as a carrier. These come in two types: non-intelligent and intelligent. The functions performed by the former include the simpler functions such as mounting and providing power as well as the more complex such as providing translation between bus types, protocols, routing of triggers and interrupts and making each mezzanine appear as a separate instrument to the host backplane. Intelligent carriers will generally perform all of the functions of the non-intelligent plus perform pre or post processing of data, allow the combination of multiple instruments into composite instruments that then may be controlled at a higher level, and perform translation of commands from older instruments so as to facilitate replacement of Legacy instruments. Of equal or greater importance in the support of the mezzanine is the software. The majority of the M-Module instrument types referenced above come with VXI/PXI Plug-and-Play or IVI drivers. However, a number of the more control oriented M-Modules are supported only with C drivers. Actions are underway that are described below which allow application of the Plug-and-Play drivers across multiple platforms. Benefits of Modularity Perhaps the greatest advantage of an M-Module mezzanine instrument is the ability of both the vendor and the user to become \\"Platform Agnostic\\". From the vendor's perspective, it is only necessary to develop one instrument, say a Pulse Generator, and with the use of carriers he can produce the same product into VXI, PXI, VME, LXI and other applications. This greatly reduces development costs when compared to the development of pulse generators for multiple buses. References *August 2008, Evaluation Engineering Magazine enews article.

He played more than 150 matches in the English Football League. Life and career Johnston was born in Glasgow. He began his football career as a junior at Cardiff City, turning professional in 1964 and making his debut at the end of the 1964‚Äì65 season at the age of 17. He was part of Cardiff's 1965 Welsh Cup-winning team. The following year he settled into the side and, playing alongside the likes of John Charles and John Toshack, he finished as the club's top scorer with a total of 23 goals. In March 1967, Johnston played in a benefit match for victims of the Aberfan disaster against Arsenal and scored twice against the London club, which persuaded them to offer ¬£20,000 to Cardiff to sign him. He made his debut for Arsenal on 19 August 1967, against Stoke City, and made 17 appearances in his first season, 1967-68. However, he could not hold down a place in 1968‚Äì69 and was dropped to the reserves, where he won a Football Combination winners' medal. Out of the Arsenal first team, he joined Second Division club Birmingham City in the summer of 1969, for a fee of ¬£30,000. He made 25 appearances and scored 3 goals for Arsenal. Signed as a replacement for Fred Pickering, Johnston failed to hold down a first-team place. A period on loan at Walsall immediately preceded a ¬£6,000 move to Fulham, where he spent two years.

The game also incorporates a stunt system to give players boosts that progressively increases their overall speed. The game is played over 6 tracks with 5 racers to choose from. It also includes up to 4 player split-screen offline multiplayer, and a Time Trial mode with online leaderboards. The game features a number of control options for players, including steering their vehicle with the motion controls of the Wii Remote alone or with the thumbstick on the Nunchuk, with the game also supporting the Classic Controller and GameCube controllers. Development High Voltage Hot Rod Show was inspired by games such as R.C. Pro-Am and Micro Machines, with the style of the characters and vehicles taking inspiration from Kustom Kulture and the artwork of Ed Roth and Kenny Howard amongst others. The game runs on High Voltage Software's Quantum 3 game engine that was used in High Voltage's previous WiiWare game Gyrostarr. The game originally was to feature 8 tracks, but 2 were cut due to Nintendo's WiiWare game size restrictions. Reception IGN scored the game a 6/10, noting the \\"inherently thin\\" content of the game and citing gameplay that follows a \\"very shallow, by-the-books design\\" that lacks polish.

It is located east of Centralia, Washington, United States in Lewis County. As of 2006, it is the only commercial coal-fired power plant in the State of Washington. A bill signed in 2011 by governor Christine Gregoire, the TransAlta Energy Transition Bill, will result in one boiler being shut down by the end of 2020 and the other by the end of 2025. Generating units =Coal-fired= The two identical coal-fired generating units have a combined capacity of 1,340 MW. Both units started up for commercial operation in August 1971. (Bonneville Power Administration 1980 EIS) In 2011, a deal was struck between the plant owner and operator, TransAlta, Governor Christine Gregoire, and Washington State environmental groups and policy makers to shut down the coal boilers. The first would be shut down in 2020, and the second in 2025, with a schedule of emissions reductions to be met along the way. The Washington State Senate approved the deal with a 36-13 vote.\\"TransAlta Agrees to Phase Out Coal Plant\\". PubliCola.com. March 9, 2011. To complete this transition, TransAlta is receiving an expedited permit, and is also exempt from any Environmental Impact Assessment that would otherwise be required. =Gas-fired= In 2002, the plant capacity was supplemented with five natural gas-fired units. Four of them are 50-MWe gas turbine (GT) units, and the fifth is a 68-MWe steam cycle unit. The entire arrangement is known as combined cycle 4-on-1 where the exhaust from the 4 GT's creates steam via Heat Recovery Steam Generators (HRSGs) to power a single steam turbine. In 2014, the gas fired portion of the plant known as the \\"Big Hanaford Plant\\" was removed from the plant footprint and parted out to various buyers. Fuel supply Seventy percent of sub- bituminous coal used by the plant was delivered by truck from the nearby Centralia Coal Mine, which was a strip mine and the largest coal mine in the state of Washington, until it closed down on November 27, 2006.\\"Centralia mine to close, putting 600 out of work,\\" Puget Sound Business Journal, Nov. 28, 2006. Retrieved on 30 January 2009. Coal from the Powder River Basin in Montana and Wyoming has also been transported by rail to be burned at the plant since 1989, but was only used to supplement Centralia Coal mine coal until 2006. By 2008, the plant was burning 100% Powder River basin coal. Recent rail upgrades to the Centralia Power Plant, and SO2 scrubber upgrades to ensure plant releases less pollution, will ensure the plant runs for at least another 15‚Äì20 years. Centralia currently burns coal from about nine 110-car coal trains each week (i.e. 990 full coal cars). Environmental and public impacts Annually, this coal plant emits 350 pounds of mercury pollution, making it the state's largest single source of mercury pollution. Mercury pollution is a bio cumulative neurotoxin which causes brain damage in humans and is especially dangerous for children and pregnant or nursing mothers.http://www.thenewstribune.com/2010/09/26/v-printerfriendly/1356827/for- childrens-sake-move-away- from.htmlhttp://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=george&dbid;=103 The plant also emits 7.5MMtCO2e, making up a large portion of Washington State's total CO2 emissions. All of the mining area is currently being reclaimed. When TransAlta bought the plant in 2000, it agreed to reduce emissions. It installed US $200 million worth of scrubbers on the plant, which were purchased from ABB Environmental Systems. Between 2010 and 2012, the Centralia Power Plant has been offline for an average of 4 months of each year. In March 2009, a proposed agreement between TransAlta and the Washington State Department of Ecology was announced, regarding a significant step forward in improving air quality in Washington. Key to the agreement is TransAlta's willingness to voluntarily reduce mercury emissions by at least 50 percent by 2012 to address air quality concerns in the region. Capture testing took place in 2009 and an activated injection product was selected. The process will cost US$20 to $30 million over the next several years. Additionally, continuous emissions monitoring systems (CEMS) for mercury measurement was certified by the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC). Currently, neither Washington State nor the U.S. federal government has regulations in place for mercury emission reductions. As part of the same agreement between TransAlta and the Washington Department of Ecology, TransAlta agreed to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) by 20 percent beginning in 2009. This is two to five years earlier than TransAlta would have been required to reduce NOx emissions if an agreement had not been reached with the Department of Ecology. In 2012, Selective Non Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) system was installed to further reduce NOx at a cost of almost $20M. It is in the commissioning and testing phase through 2014.http://www.transalta.com/2009rs/environment/emissions/ and http://www.ecy.wa.gov/programs/air/TransAlta/Final_agreement/Transalta_signed_agreement.pdf owner of Centralia plant and Washington State Ecology.

Background Shut Out was a chestnut stallion sired by Hall of Famer Equipoise, the multiple stakes-winning champion his fans called \\"The Chocolate Soldier.\\" Shut Out was bred by Greentree Stable in Lexington, Kentucky, owned by Mrs. Payne Whitney (Helen Hay Whitney), who had also bred his dam, Goose Egg, by the French stallion Chicle. Racing career The year Shut Out was born, Greentree Stables also produced top runner Devil Diver, who beat Shut Out in the 1941 Hopeful Stakes for 2-year-olds. Hall of Fame conditioner John Gaver, training for Greentree, gave Eddie Arcaro his choice of Kentucky Derby mounts: Devil Diver or Shut Out. Arcaro chose Devil Diver, who came in sixth. Shut Out, under jockey Wayne D. Wright, won the race. Arcaro switched mounts for the Belmont Stakes, riding Shut Out to victory. Shut Out's other main rival that year was Alsab, 1941's U.S. Champion Two- Year-Old Colt. Alsab also took 1942's three-year-old honors. Yet Shut Out came close to winning the 1942 Triple Crown, losing the Preakness Stakes to Alsab while finishing fifth after a troubled trip. He also won the prestigious Travers Stakes, again under Arcaro. Shut Out held a 3 to 2 margin over Alsab when Alsab finished fourth in his career finale, while Shut Out was third in an overnight handicap in 1944. Stud record Shut Out died in 1964 after a respectable career at stud, siring a number of stakes winners for Greentree such as One Hitter.

He was the second son of Rev. Edmund Hollond, of Benhall Lodge, Saxmundham, Suffolk by his first wife Isabella n√©e Robinson and was educated at Harrow School. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge in 1862 and was President of the Union in 1865. He received a bachelor's degree in 1865, receiving a second class in the Classical Tripos. He subsequently obtained a master's degree. He was then admitted at the Inner Temple on 12 November 1864 and called to the Bar on 10 June 1870. He never practised law, however. On 17 August 1870 he married Fanny Eliza Keats, and the couple had six children. By 1879 Hollond was chairman of the Paddington Board of Guardians, although he was resident in the coastal resort of Brighton. In that year he was selected by the Liberal Party along with William Thackeray Marriott to contest the two seat parliamentary constituency of Brighton. At the general election in April 1880 the two Liberals topped the poll, unseating the sitting Conservative members of parliament. In 1884 Marriott resigned his seat to be re-elected as a Conservative, and at the general election of 1885 Hollond lost his seat to David Smith of the Conservative Party. Following a split in the Liberals over Irish Home Rule, Hollond became a Liberal Unionist, standing unsuccessfully at East Perthshire. By 1889 he was president of the Marylebone Liberal Unionist Association. He was a Deputy Lieutenant for London and Justice of the Peace for Devon, Somerset and Middlesex. During this time he lived at Stanmore Hall, Middlesex, and \\"Wonham\\", Bampton, Devon, inheriting the latter from his aunt Mrs Robert Hollond in 1884. He died at his London residence, 41 Prince's Gate, Westminster, in October 1912 aged 68. He was buried at Stanmore. References  External links  * *Biography, drawn from Burke, L.G., 1939; Univ.

As a young man Gore's ambition was to be a philosopher, but as a student at Trinity College, Oxford (following in the steps of his great uncle Bishop Charles Gore), he soon found that his real passion was for drawing and painting at the Ruskin School of Arthttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1406397.stm which he attended almost daily. Leaving Oxford, and arriving in London, Gore trained at the Slade under Henry Tonks and at the Westminster School of Art with Mark Gertler and Polunin from whom he learnt the flat-on-the-floor method of painting backdrops for the theatre: most useful later on when as an active member of the Balalaika Dance Group as dancer and organiser of events, he enhanced their productions with his professional expertise. He wrote a very successful folk ballet. Pre-World War II, his career took off when a Greek patron saw his work and asked him to spend a year travelling and painting in Greece. Visits and extended sojourns to France followed, and an exhibition at Gallery Borghese in Paris in 1938 when Vauxelles called him the English fauve. Soon after, however, he was forced to leave and return to the UK. During World War II, Gore was camouflage officer for the south-east and helped prepare the troops for the D-Day invasion.War paint: art, war, state and identity in Britain, 1939‚Äì1945, Issue 8846 By Brian Foss (Page 16) In 1946, he began teaching at Saint Martin's School of Art, where he was Head of Painting from 1951 until 1979. In 1961 he was appointed Vice-Principal of Saint Martin's until he retired from the post in 1979.The International Who's Who 2004 by Elizabeth Sleeman, Routledge, 2003 , (Page 632) His students and colleagues there included many of the most accomplished artists of the twentieth century who continue to acknowledge the encouragement they received from Gore. Summer months for many years were spent painting outside: on the Greek islands of Paros (1950s) and later on Aegina. Then during the 1960s, the rich hinterland of Majorca, followed by the brilliantly-lit landscapes of Provence. He exhibited at the Redfern Gallery until they took to abstract art, the Juster Gallery (NY), Fosse, Lavenham, Richmond Hill Gallery ‚Äì always keeping his independence to exhibit wherever he so wanted. Gore was a Trustee of the Imperial War Museum (1967‚Äì1984), and was Chairman of its Artistic Records Committee (1972‚Äì1986). In 1972, Gore was elected as a Royal Academician, and from 1976 to 1987 he was Chairman of the Royal Academy of Arts Exhibitions Committee. In 1980, Gore visited the US for the first time to deliver a dissertation at the Yale Center for British Art, New Haven, Connecticut. Staying en route in New York he was so exhilarated by its exciting light and ambience that since then he visited almost yearly. He made an important contribution as a figurative painter with an enormous experience of paint, composition and colour to show the vitality of the US, when American artists had mostly turned to abstraction and were exploring painterly possibilities in a different direction. Gore was made CBE in 1987. In 1991 he designed a series of posters for the London Transport Museum.http://www.ltmcollection.org/posters/artist/artist.html?IXartist=Frederick+Gore His last solo exhibition was at the Richmond Hill Gallery, London (January 2009). His published books include \\"Abstract Art\\",Methuen & Co Ltd, 1961 \\"Painting: Some Basic Principles\\"London, Studio Vista; New York, Reinhold Pub. Corp., 1965. and \\"The Baptism, Piero della Francesca\\";London, Cassell, 1969. , he is also the author of an unpublished translation of poems by Baudelaire. Gore died age 95 on 31 August 2009. He is buried in Brompton Cemetery. Personal life Gore had a son and two daughters. His wife Constance (Connie) survived him.

Ogawauchi's greatest fame came as the fifth member of the Crazy Max stable in Toryumon. Career = Toryumon (2001-2004) = Jun Ogawauchi debuted as a member of the T2P project, a particular branch of the Toryumon system led by √öltimo Drag√≥n, wrestling his early career in Mexico. He began to make appearances in Toryumon Japan in 2002 alongside classmate Shuji Kondo, but Kondo was clearly considered to be of a higher rank to Ogawauchi. This would be a theme of Ogawauchi's career for many years, with him suffering in the shadow of his peers. He struggled through a few injuries once he came to Toryumon Japan on a permanent basis and also impressed on the last T2P show with his performance against T2P monster Toru Owashi. Ogawauchi received his biggest break in 2003. Crazy Max, arguably the greatest stable in Dragon System history, declared they were looking for a new member. However, fans were shocked when Takamichi Iwasa, who had been appealing to become the 5th member, was denied the spot, and the place was actually given to the rookie Ogawauchi on May 11, 2003,http://dgusa.puroresufan.com/cmax.html who was renamed to simply JUN. After a slow start where he struggled to gain acceptance, an impressive performance in the 2003 Rey de Parejas lead to an increase in his charisma and alterations in his ring style to fit in with his new team-mates. These alterations were rewarded when he defeated Shuji Condo for the British Commonwealth Junior Heavyweight Championship. He is the last person to date to have held that particular title, as the title was vacated on November 10, 2003 and has not been revived since. However, disaster struck in December when he suffered an injury during a match against \\"brother\\" Yasshi. Rumours also circulated that his injury had been worsened during a Crazy Max trip to South Korea. This was bad news, as Cima himself had declared that 2004 would be a renaissance year for Crazy Max. Ogawauchi retired from active professional wrestling in February 2004, tearfully citing herniated cervical vertebrae which were causing numbness in his left arm. His final match was a tag team match on February 26, 2004 alongside his Crazy Max mentor Cima in a loss to the Aagan Issou team of Shuji Kondo and \\"brother\\" Yasshi. Following the loss, Ogawauchi took the microphone and told his Crazy Max team-mates how much he loved them. Don Fujii then helped him to climb up the corner of the ring and pose for one last time, and Cima carried him out on his back. In an interesting note, they never played the 10 bell salute for Ogawauchi, a custom for leaving wrestlers, suggesting there was a glimmer of hope for a return. = Dragondoor and El Dorado (2005-2008) = Ogawauchi resurfaced on July 19, 2005 on the debut show of Dragondoor Project, reuniting with several of his T2P classmates on the show, such as Toru Owashi, Shuji Kondo and Milano Collection AT. Still firmly retired, Ogawauchi worked as the ring announcer for the promotion. Jun was not the only T2P star to resurface for the promotion, as he was joined by Mototsugu Shimizu, Kinya Oyanagi and Venezia. When Dragondoor ended in early 2006, Ogawauchi moved on to the followup promotion Pro Wrestling El Dorado set up by Dragondoor owner Noriaki Kawabata. To fit with the El Dorado theme, Ogawauchi has taken to dressing as a pirate for his ring announcing duties, donning a look reminiscent of Jack Sparrow. El Dorado ceased operations in December 2008 due to dwindling fan interest caused by the departure of the Aagan Iisou stable. = Pro Wrestling Secret Base (2009-present) = Following El Dorado's closure, several former members formed Pro Wrestling Secret Base, a small scale continuation of El Dorado wrestling out of Chofu. Initially working as a ring announcer, Ogawauchi made a return to the ring after five years on October 20, 2009. He teamed with Masa Takanashi against Kinya Oyanagi and Satoshi Kajiwara. Though Ogawauchi was pinned by Oyanagi, it marked the beginning of his return to full-time active wrestling. Ogawauchi continues to wrestle for Secret Base as a member of the promotion's home army, regularly teaming with Mototsugu Shimizu. Since returning, he has wrestled most notably for Big Japan Pro Wrestling and New Japan Pro-Wrestling's NEVER series. On May 4, 2015, Ogawauchi defeated Go to win the Captain of the Secret Base Openweight Championship, losing the title to Mototsugu Shimizu on September 9.

LEDs (light emitting diodes) are very inexpensive to purchase and have become a new way to make street art. Many artists who use LEDs are guerrilla artists, incorporating LEDs to produce temporary pieces in public places. LEDs may be used in installation art, sculptural pieces and interactive artworks.  Infamous LED art  In early 2007, there was a bomb scare in Boston, Massachusetts in the United States caused by a guerrilla marketing campaign. An advertising firm working for Cartoon Network to promote the network's animated television show Aqua Teen Hunger Force, hired two artists to produce art for the ad campaign. The artists placed LED signs in various locations across ten cities. However, Boston was the only city that reacted by shutting down bridges and bringing in bomb squads to remove the LEDs. The majority of the light boards were removed and the artists were arrested. Cartoon Network general manager Jim Samples resigned as a result of the incident.  Artists and works incorporating LEDs  *Jenny Holzer - One of the most well known artists who incorporates LEDs into her work. She uses familiar statements and reinterprets them to alter their meanings. *Brigitte Kowanz - artist based in Vienna *Meeli K√µiva (aka Mery Crystal Ra) - an artist who achieved acknowledgement for her installation \\"Reactive River\\" (European Parliament main building, Brussels, Belgium) *Liz LaManche - creates large paintings illuminated by color-changing LED light for a motion effect *Liu Dao - an art collective in China that uses actors and filmmakers to make animated LED portraits.

Artists throw individual LEDs onto a metallic object, like public sculpture or road infrastructure, which itself acts as a canvas. LED throwies were invented in 2006 by the artists Evan Roth and James Powderly, the founder of Graffiti Research Lab at Eyebeam Atelier open lab New York City. After Graffiti Research Lab posted the instructions how to make a throwie on Instructables, throwies went viral on the Internet and could be found in advertising, were for sale as DIY kits or further developed by other artists and hackers worldwide. Blinkies Animations of various blinkies Blinkies are small electronic devices that make very bright (usually flashing) light using LEDs and small batteries. They are often sold by vendors at night-time events that have fireworks displays such as Independence Day, Canada Day, or Guy Fawkes Night. They are also popular at raves, New Year's Eve parties and nighttime sporting events. There is no industry standard or official name for blinkies, but most common names use some combination of the terms flash, magnet, strobe, body, blink, light, and/or jewelry. Common examples are blinkies, blinkees, body lights, blinky body lights, magnetic flashers, or flashing jewelry. = Uses = Blinkies are most often used for amusement at raves, parties and nighttime events. Their other uses include: * Blinkies imprinted with company logos at conventions * Safety lights for children during Halloween, or nighttime events * Fun and safety during camping trips * Emergency flashers for disabled automobiles or lost hikers (most blinkies have over a one-mile visibility range at night) * The term blinky is often used for bicycle lights which flash. In some countries, blinkies can be used as a primary light on a bicycle. * Blinkies also can be attached to mobiles (cell phones). When the mobile turns on, makes a call, or receives a call, the blinky will keep flashing. * \\"Winky blinkies\\" can refer to stage and film props which display lighting effects, or \\"gags,\\" during a dramatic production. = Construction = Body A typical blinky is a small plastic two-piece cylinder wide enough to accept a button cell battery with a small etched circuit board on the face and threads on the open end, paired with a cylinder cap which screws on to seal and secure as one. The flashing LED circuit board face can be round and enclosed by the cylinder, or a variety larger colored shapes such as logos that are glued to the outside face of the cylinder end. Common designs utilize a rubber ring gasket as an on/off switch. When placed between the batteries and circuit board inside the front cover, tightening the screw base deforms and flattens the gasket forcing the battery tip to contact the back of the printed circuit board, which completes the circuit. Modern blinkees are more likely to use a battery case that opens with a small eyeglasses type screw and a push button on/off switch.  Back  The most common designs use a set of strong magnets, one at the back of the blinky, and another that can be removed. This allows the light to be easily attached to clothes, or stuck onto any magnetic metal such as buttons or belt buckles. Clips are often used to make earrings, a loop can make a pendant, or a ring can be welded to the back to make a finger ring. Double sided adhesive pads are sometimes used to stick the blinky directly to the body, most often in the navel.  Circuit board  The circuit board typically has anywhere from 2 to as many as 25 micro- LEDs. LEDs that emit different colors within the visible spectrum are commonly used, whereas ultraviolet or infrared LEDs are less common in blinkies. Blue, white, violet, and ultra-violet LEDs often require two or more battery cells, due to their higher voltage requirements. The visible side of the etched circuit board can be constructed to flash in a variety of ways, especially where there are multiple LEDs in multiple colours. A clear plastic conformal coating material such as silicone, acrylic or epoxy protects the fragile LEDs on the exposed front of the board. Shaped boards have literally hundreds of variations combined with imprinting. Common shapes (besides the classic small circle) are stars, hearts, flowers, flags, animals, holiday symbols (like Halloween jack-o-lanterns), and sports team logos.

It was a Windows-based desktop environment with open-source applications and system utilities developed upon the reBOX web application framework by iCUBE Network Solutions, an Austrian company located in Vienna.  About the project  OOS.cc, which is short for Online Operating System, was a web application platform that mimicked the look and feel of classic desktop operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X or KDE. It consisted of various open source applications built upon the so-called reBOX web application framework. As applications could be executed in an integrated and parallel way, the OOS could have been considered a web desktop or webtop. It provided basic services such as a GUI, a virtual file system, access control management and possibilities to develop and deploy applications online. As the Online Operating System was executed within a web browser, it was no real operating system but rather a portal to various web applications, offering a high usability and flexibility. The project was partly funded by grants from the Internetprivatstiftung Austria (IPA). As at 01.08.2008 almost 20.000 users have joined the oos.cc community, using the offered featured and applications.  History  The development of the web desktop was started by iCUBE Network Solutions in 2005, followed by the first beta releases in 2006. Hence, together with YouOS and eyeOS, it can be considered to be one of the first publicly available systems of its kind. The first full version including core-level multi-language support, the file system and a basic set of applications was released to the public in March 2007 on the occasion of a national exhibition (ITnT Austria) and has left beta state half a year later in October 2007. The first release considered stable (1.0.0) was published in July 2007. The project itself and the contained applications have received several national innovation awards (see, ) and have gained attention mainly due to the comprehensive approach taken (see, ). OOS.cc started as a national project. The full platform including all offered applications are currently available in three languages (German, English as well as Spanish) and is receiving increasing coverage around the world (for examples see, or). The current version is 1.3.01 from 01.08.2008.  Technical Overview  The project is fully written in JavaScript, exclusively using DHTML techniques to run in any web browser without any additional software installation needed. The system implements a modern kind of web application model, excessively using Ajax for communicating between client components and the Java server backend in an exclusively asynchronous manner. Aim is to offer users the unique interaction behavior following the desktop metaphor, which is the main idea of any web desktop. Also typical for this sort of web application is the broadly use of Javascript-on-demand techniques, cutting the complete project source into pieces and loading them instantly when needed. Based on this technical basis, reBOX was the framework library all applications in oos.cc were built of. It is a fully flexible and extensible API, including a GUI widget set, communication mechanisms and server services offering general and framework specific services. The Online Operating System itself consisted of a basic framework, which was able to launch any JavaScript application using the reBOX library. The user interface was based on the behavior of the Windows desktop with a start menu, a task bar and a desktop background. All applications were running in this environment. At server side, there were Java based web services that ran to serve the client processes and to provide data from the relational database in the backend. oos.cc also provided an integrated development environment called Developer Suite, which allowed the community to build own applications for the desktop environment based on reBOX (see development section below).  License  All applications available in oos.cc were open source under the European Union Public Licence (EUPL). The reBOX development toolkit is free to use developing any applications for the webtop.  Features  As mentioned above, all applications published on oos.cc are open source based on the EUPL, and can be \\"installed\\" or \\"deinstalled\\" to what-ever preferences the user has. Besides global services like the multi-language support or the global theme support, as well as some minor tools and games, oos.cc offered four major services that could be used completely free of charge. * Integrated and fully flexible file storage (1 GB per user) ** HTTP as well as FTP file transfer from and to local file system ** User-based file-shares within the oos-community ** WebDAV access ** Document Management (including Version Control and File Locking mechanisms) * Image publishing, organization and post-processing * A free sub domain (user.oos.cc) for web- or image publishing, directly integrated in the desktop * Groupware applications, including free mail, fetchmail and contact management * An integrated development environment where oos-applications can be created directly from within the system (see development section below) Next releases were planned to focus on an extensive security and privacy suite, dealing with challenges like anonymous communication (browsing as well as temporary mail-addresses) as well as offering encrypted password and file storage and connectivity services. Since its initial stable release, OOS.cc could have been accessed using https to ensure secure communication.  Limitations and drawbacks  * Limited number of applications: no commercial applications can be hosted. Only reviewed applications are being published * No processing of popular office formats (.doc, .odt, etc.) * Limited language support: Only English, German and Spanish * Dependence on foreign infrastructure: No possibility to extend storage, no additional/guaranteed bandwidth, etc.  Development  One of the key focuses of the team was right from the beginning to offer a very flexible and comprehensive API, that can be used to develop not only custom applications within oos.cc, but also stand- alone web-applications or to integrate single components in existing web- sites. By decoupling the development from web-related \\"problems\\" using the reBOX API web-applications can be development in a similar fashion to any Java program: Elements can be positioned and can interact like in high-level object oriented programming languages, without taking care of divs, browser specific behavior or communication handling. The framework also offers multi-language and theme support for existing as well as newly created applications, allowing changing almost every aspect of the look and feel of the used components according to the preferences of its users. For taking advantage of this approach, one of the applications offered in the OOS was an integrated Development Suite, allowing directly writing and executing code and hence creating new programs within the boundaries of the web computer. All applications on oos.cc were released as open source, thus all existing programs were offered to be imported, reviewed or changed and then locally deployed. Following this idea, every user was free to submit changed or newly created applications to be included in the globally offered application set. The last release offered features like auto-completion and an outline-window.

Peptide T, and its modified analog Dala1-peptide T-amide (DAPTA), a drug in clinical trials, is a short peptide derived from the HIV envelope protein gp120 which blocks binding and infection of viral strains which use the CCR5 receptor to infect cells. Peptide T has several positive effects related to HIV disease and Neuro-AIDS. A FDG-PET neuro-imaging study in an individual with AIDS dementia who completed a 12-wk treatment with intranasal DAPTA, showed remission in 34 out of 35 brain regions after treatment. A placebo-controlled, three site, 200+ patient NIH-funded clinical trial, which focused on neurocognitive improvements, was conducted between 1990 and 1995. The results showed that DAPTA was not significantly different from placebo on the study primary end points. However, 2 of 7 domains, abstract thinking and speed of information processing, did show improvement in the DAPTA group (p<.05). Furthermore, twice as many DAPTA-treated patients improved, whereas twice as many placebo patients deteriorated (P=.02). A sub- group analysis showed that DAPTA had a treatment effect and improved global cognitive performance (P=.02) in the patients who had more severe cognitive impairment. An analysis of antiviral effects from the 1996 NIH study showed peripheral viral load (combined plasma and serum) was significantly reduced in the DAPTA-treated group. An eleven-person study for peptide T effects on cellular viral load showed reductions in the persistently infected monocyte reservoir to undetectable levels in most of the patients. Elimination of viral reservoirs, such as the monocytes, is an important treatment goal. , peptide T is not currently available as a treatment in any country. Popular culture In the 2013 biographical film Dallas Buyers Club,Dallas Buyers Club. Dir. Jean-Marc Vall√©e. Perf. Matthew McConaughey. Truth Entertainment, Voltage Pictures; Focus Features (US), 2013. protagonist Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey) promotes the use of injected peptide T as a treatment for HIV/AIDS and Alzheimer's Disease and sues the FDA over their efforts to limit his ability to use peptide T, as it was an unapproved medicine. Additional information on Woodroof's court challenge to the FDA related to his obtaining access to peptide T can be found in the article by Marsha Cohen in Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly (vol.18:471) Cohen, 1991. Woodroof's challenge was in part responsible for the 1987 revisions to the FDA investigational drug regulations that expanded access to experimental drugs for patients with serious diseases with no alternative therapies.

Thomas (born 5 June 1964 on Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, England) is a human evolutionary geneticist, Professor of Evolutionary Genetics at the Research Department of Genetics, Evolution and Environment at University College London. He was formerly a researcher in the department of Biological Anthropology at the University of Cambridge.Prof Mark Thomas , UCL School of Life and Medical Sciences  Scientific career  Thomas is notable for a number of scientific publications in the fields of human demographic and evolutionary history inference, molecular phylogenetics of extinct species using ancient DNA, Cultural evolutionary modelling, and molecular biology. In 1994 Thomas was one of the first people to read the DNA sequence of the extinct woolly mammothHagelberg et al., 1994; Thomas et al., 2000a and in 1998 he coauthored a paper providing genetic support to the claim of recent patrilineal common ancestry among the Jewish priestly caste known as Kohanim (singular \\"Kohen\\", \\"Cohen\\", or Kohane). Between 2000 and 2003 Thomas coauthored several other papers on the origins of various Jewish and Judaic groups, including the Lemba, otherwise known as the \\"Black Jews of Southern Africa\\".Thomas et al., 2000b. In 2002 Thomas coauthored a paper providing Y chromosome evidence for a very high Anglo-Saxon component of patrilineal ancestry in central England.Weale et al., 2002. This result proved unpalatable for many archaeologists and led to Thomas developing the \\"apartheid-like social structure\\" modelThomas et al., 2006 to explain the discrepancy between archaeological and genetic estimates of the scale of Anglo-Saxon migration. Thomas has also worked extensively on the evolution of lactase persistence (see Lactose intolerance), the ability of some humans to produce the enzyme lactase throughout their adult life and thus to consume appreciable quantities of fresh milk without the discomforts of lactose malabsorption. In 2004 he led a study to show that most lactase persistent Africans did not have the same mutation causing it as Europeans.Charlotte A. Mulcare, Michael E. Weale, Abigail L . Jones, Bruce Connell, David Zeitlin, Ayele Tarekegn, Dallas M. Swallow, Neil Bradman and Mark G. Thomas (2004) The T allele located 13.9 kb upstream of the lactase gene (LCT) (C-13.9kbT) does not predict or cause the lactase persistence phenotype in Africans. American Journal of Human Genetics 74: pp1102‚Äì1110. In 2007, in collaboration with Joachim Burger's group in Mainz, Germany, he showed that the genetic variant that causes lactase persistence in most Europeans (-13,910*T) was rare or absent in early farmers from central Europe.J. Burger, M. Kirchner, B. Bramanti, W. Haak, M. G. Thomas (2007) Absence of the Lactase-Persistence associated allele in early Neolithic Europeans . Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 104: pp3736-3741. In 2009 Thomas led a computer simulation study indicating that lactase persistence started to co-evolve with the culture of dairying in the LBK (Linearbandkeramik) culture.Yuval Itan, Adam Powell, Mark A. Beaumont, Joachim Burger and Mark G. Thomas (2009) The Origins of Lactase Persistence in Europe. PLoS Comput Biol 5(8): e1000491. In 2009 ‚Äì in collaboration with Prof Stephen Shennan and Dr Adam Powell ‚Äì Thomas published a study in the journal Science showing that population density and or migratory activity are likely to be a major determinants in the maintenance or loss of culturally inherited skills, and that this seemed to explain a number of curious features of the appearance of behavioural modernity in humans at different times in different parts of the world.Powell, A., Shennan, S., and Thomas, M.G.

It is one of the first African national dance companies. It has toured extensively around the world. Although the name might suggest the idea of European ballet to English speakers, because the name is in French, the focus of the company is actually on promoting traditional African dance and culture. History The roots of the Les Ballets Africains go back to Guinean poetry student, dancer, choreographer and musician Fod√©ba Ke√Øta. In France in 1948, he founded a poetry group for Africans, which gradually evolved into the drumming, dancing and storytelling African Theater Ballet of Fodeba Keita. It toured Europe from 1951 to 1955 and the United States in 1953. It became Les Ballets Africains in 1952 in Paris. There was strong opposition at first; various tribes were offended that others were dancing their dances and singing their songs, but gradually that objection was overcome. In the 1950s, among the notable musicians recruited were djembe drummers \\"Papa\\" Ladji Camara of Mali and Guinean Famoudou Konat√©. The group performed in the United States in 1959, with a run of 48 performances on Broadway, following a successful European tour. After Guinea obtained its independence from France in 1958, then President of Guinea Ahmed S√©kou Tour√© made the ballet the national ensemble. When President S√©kou Tour√© died in 1984, government support came to an end, and the troupe encountered financial difficulties for several years, but has subsequently resumed touring. In 1991, Italo Zambo, the company's artistic director, noted that the Los Angeles day performances differed from the night ones and performances in Africa and Europe in one respect: traditionally, Guinean men and women dance bare-chested. In 1967, while touring in Quebec, Canada, the troupe's director had to go to court in Montreal to answer the charge of inciting minors to give an indecent performance for this very reason. The judge dismissed the charge.

Focusing on the cultural life of the city of Chicago, each issue of The Chicagoan contained art, music, and drama reviews, profiles of personalities and institutions, commentaries on the local scene, and editorials, along with cartoons and original art. In an early issue, The Chicagoans editors claimed to represent \\"a cultural, civilized and vibrant\\" city \\"which needs make no obeisance to Park Avenue, Mayfair, or the Champs Elysees.\\" Despite its lofty aims, the stalwart assertions of publisher Martin J. Quigley (who once wrote that \\"Whatever Chicago was and was to be, The Chicagoan must be and become\\"), and a circulation that sometimes rose above 20,000, the magazine was largely forgotten after its last issue.Neil Harris, The Chicagoan: A Lost Magazine of the Jazz Age (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 2008), 1‚Äì27. Only two substantial collections remain, one at the University of Chicago's Regenstein Library and the other at the New York Public Library. Cultural historian Neil Harris has written a book on the subject, The Chicagoan: A Lost Magazine of the Jazz Age (the University of Chicago Press).  Authors  Marie Armstrong Hecht (1892‚Äì?). First editor of The Chicagoan, a writer and literary critic. Married to journalist-author Ben Hecht from 1915 to 1925. Marie Hecht published several volumes of poetry in the 1920s and created or adapted some Broadway plays in the 1920s and 1930s. Under a later married name, Marie Essipoff, she produced a number of books in the 1950s emphasizing economical cooking with new techniques, including Making the Most of Your Food Freezer.Harris, 371 Richard Atwater, \\"Riq\\" (1892‚Äì1948). Born in Chicago as Frederick Mund Atwater, he attended the University of Chicago, where he wrote for the student newspaper and later taught Classical Greek. He went on to work for various local newspapers, including the Chicago Daily News, the Chicago Tribune, and the Herald-Examiner. With his wife, Florence Atwater, in 1938 he coauthored Mr. Popper's Penguins, which won the Newbery Medal.Harris, 370  Artists  E. Simms Campbell (1908‚Äì71). The first African American cartoonist with a national reputation, Campbell was born in St. Louis and graduated from Englewood High School in Chicago. He attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago between 1924 and 1926 and later he moved to New York, where he was employed as a cartoonist at the Daily Mirror. He did important illustrations for some African American publications, including Crisis and Opportunity, but was better known for his color cartoons in Esquire. He would later work for a string of national advertisers and for Playboy.Harris, 370 Albert Carreno (1905‚Äì64). This Mexican-born caricaturist and cartoonist portrayed stage and sports personalities for The Chicagoan in the late 1920s while working for the Chicago Daily News. He then moved to New York and was employed by a series of publishers and comic-book producers including Fawcett, National, and Marvel.Harris, 370 Nat Karson (1908‚Äì54). Born in Switzerland, he attended Chicago public schools and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and increasingly concentrated his efforts on theatrical caricature. After he moved to New York, his theatrical designs and productions attracted wide attention; he created both sets and costumes with the Federal Theater Project and with Orson Welles.Harris, 372 A. Raymond Katz (1895‚Äì1974), aka Sandor. Born in Hungary, Katz attended both the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts. He created car cards, posters, and other commercial art before becoming the featured artist of The Chicagoan.Harris, 372 Isadore Klein (1897‚Äì1986). Magazine cartoonist, animator, sketcher, painter, and story writer, Klein worked for The New Yorker as well as for The Chicagoan and was involved with a series of famous studios and celebrated cartoons, from Krazy Kat and Betty Boop to Popeye. He was widely credited with originating the idea for Mighty Mouse.Harris, 372 Boris Riedel (no dates available). Creator of The Chicagoans first cover, Riedel served for a while as the magazine's art editor. He illustrated a book of poetry by Marie Hecht, a novel by J. V. Nicholson, and a children's book, The Timid Giant, written by advertising executive Earle Ludgin. Riedel also created movie posters for films starring Clara Bow, Lon Chaney Sr., and Adolphe Menjou, and contributed to The Linebook, a publication put out for WGN Radio, a Tribune Company outlet in Chicago.Harris, 374  Resurrection  J.

He was a member of the National Parliament of the Solomon Islands, representing the Gizo/Kolombangara constituency spanning Gizo and the island of Kolombangara in Western Province. Lilo served as the Minister of Finance of the Solomon Islands from 2006 to 2007 and from 2010 to 2011. Biography =Personal life= Lilo is originally from the village of Ghatere on Kolombangara island. He earned a master's degree in development and administration from the Crawford School of Economics and Government at Australian National University. Lilo's CV also includes a Postgraduate Diploma and Bachelor of Economics received from the University of Papua New Guinea. =Career= Lilo worked as a permanent secretary for the Ministries of Finance and of the Environment before entering politics. He was elected to the National Parliament of the Solomon Islands in 2001. In November 2011, Prime Minister Danny Philip fired Lilo, his Finance Minister, and Central Bank Governor Rick Hou, accusing both of undermining his government. Philip had been accused of misusing and misappropriating a $10 million national development fund, which had been allocated to Solomon Islands from the government of Taiwan. In response to his sacking, Lilo told reporters, \\"No one undermined the prime minister, but he undermined himself by abusing his powers and the highest office in the country. He sacked us to create a vacuum to lure MPs from the opposition.\\" Lilo further criticized Philips, \\"What he (Mr Philip) did was unbelievable, unacceptable and sickening.\\" =Prime Minister of Solomon Islands= Prime Minister Danny Philip resigned on 11 November 2011, ahead of a vote of no confidence stemming from the allegations of the misuse of Taiwanese funds. On 16 November 2011, Lilo was elected Prime Minister of Solomon Islands, winning a majority of the 29 of the 49 eligible members of Parliament and defeating three other rivals for the office. Former Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare of East Choiseul received nine votes, MP for North Vella La Vella Milner Tozaka received nine votes, and MP for Gao/Bugotu Samuel Manetoali earned just two votes in parliament. Lilo was declared the winner by Governor General Sir Frank Kabui. Lilo took the oath of office before Kabui at approximately 5 p.m. On 18 November two days after his election Lilo held his first official engagement with US ambassador to the Solomon Islands, Teddy Taylor regarding the Solomon Islands eligibility for US Millennium Challenge Account funding. Lilo is a member of the National Coalition for Reform and Advancement (NCRA), the same party as his predecessor, Danny Philip. Lilo took over the leadership of the NCRA from Philips, which retains the Office of Prime Minister. Prime Minister Lilo completed his cabinet appointments by 23 November 2011, restoring almost all of ministers from the previous NCRA government to their posts. The only major change was Lilo's appointment of Rick Hou as the country's new finance minister. Lilo reappointed Manasseh Maelanga as deputy prime minister. Maelanga was also appointed Home Affairs Minister.\\"Ten more ministers sworn in\\" , Solomon Star, 23 November 2011 Lilo is a key supporter of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands. Prime Minister Lilo pledged to refocus on Solomon Islands' faltering coconut industry at the opening 48th Asian Pacific Coconut Committee (APCC) Ministerial meeting, which was held at the Mendana Hotel in Honiara on 28 November 2011. Lilo's government (backed by the governments of Nauru, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Timor-Leste) introduced the motion which led to the United Nations General Assembly re-inscribing French Polynesia on the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories in May 2013. Lilo stated that he wished to see French Polynesia obtain self- determination regarding its future status.\\"Solomon Islands made history in UN\\", Solomon Star, 21 May 2013 The day before the vote in the General Assembly, the Assembly of French Polynesia formally protested against the prospect of the country being re-added to the list.\\"Tahiti assembly votes against UN decolonisation bid\\", Radio New Zealand International, 17 May 2013 France denounced Solomon Islands-introduced motion as \\"blatant interference [and] a complete absence of respect for the democratic choice of [French] Polynesians\\", who had just elected a government hostile to the prospect of independence.\\"Polyn√©sie : la France d√©nonce une \\"ing√©rence flagrante\\" de l'ONU\\", Le Monde, 17 May 2013 References External links *Member page at Parliament website Category:1965 births Category:Australian National University alumni Category:Finance Ministers of the Solomon Islands Category:Government ministers of the Solomon Islands Category:Living people Category:Members of the National Parliament of the Solomon Islands Category:People from the Western Province (Solomon Islands) Category:Prime Ministers of the Solomon Islands Category:University of Papua New Guinea alumni ","title":"Gordon Darcy Lilo"},{"id":"20098224","text":"Varian Lonamei (born May 10, 1962) is a member of the National Parliament of the Solomon Islands.

In 1970 it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, along with the nearby Cannon Building. Since 1986 it has also been a contributing property to the Central Troy Historic District. It is five stories tall and three bays wide. The eastern (front) facade is done in terra cotta with details in iron and glass. The latter two materials are combined to create the building's most distinctive feature, the proscenium-style arched window across the bottom two stories. The building was constructed in 1904 during an early 20th-century building boom in downtown Troy. It originally housed the R.C. Reynolds home furnishing store. The store's grand opening on September 16, 1904 was attended by a crowd of thousands. An article in the Troy Times praised the building calling it \\"one of the most attractive show buildings in the city\\".

Early life and education Scott was born in 1960 in Nairobi, Kenya. She graduated from University of Edinburgh with a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree and from the University of Strathclyde with a Diploma in Legal Practice (DipLP). Legal career Scott was admitted as a solicitor in 1989, and she was called to the bar in Scotland (the Faculty of Advocates) in 1991. She \\"took silk\\" (became a Queen's Counsel) in 2002. She has acted as lead counsel in a number of high-profile appeal cases such as the Lockerbie bombing and the Glasgow Ice Cream Wars, in which she defended Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Thomas \\"TC\\" Campbell, respectively. She was also successful in the appeal case of Kim Galbraith, whose murder conviction for shooting her policeman husband was reduced to diminished responsibility. =Megrahi's second appeal= On 6 November 2008, Scott applied to the Court of Criminal Appeal for Megrahi's release on bail pending the second appeal against his conviction at the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial in 2001. The three judges reserved their judgment on the application. A week later, Megrahi's bail application was refused. Megrahi was told he would remain in jail for the duration of his second appeal. =Judicial career= From 2003 to 2012, Scott was a part-time sheriff.

Her comment was viewed as inappropriate, with the Scottish Conservative Chief Whip James Lamont arguing that, \\"plenty of people have had tough lives ... but don‚Äôt rape anyone.\\" In 2017, Scott granted a man who confessed to the rape of a 12-year-old child an absolute discharge. Although Scott acknowledged that Scottish law dictates an individual under the age of 13 is considered incapable of giving consent in any circumstance, she stated that the victim was not distressed and that all eyewitnesses believed her to be over 16. Rape Crisis England and Wales critiqued Scott's ruling, saying that, as a 12-year-old has no legal capacity to consent, sexual activity with them is always illegal. Moreover, it is an adult's responsibility to ensure that their partner is capable of giving consent. In a letter published after the trial, the victim claimed that she was unconscious at the time of the attack, further calling into question her ability to consent. Personal life Scott's partner is Frank Richard Crowe, a sheriff. Together they have one son.

In the Franco era he served as provincial president of the metal syndicate from 1963 to 1966. He served as procurator for Valencia province in the Francoist Cortes from 1973 until its dissolution in 1977. He was appointed Mayor of Valencia in September 1973 and served until April 1979. However in June 1977, when the first democratic government was formed, he resigned the office considering that he was no longer authorised to head it, but was persuaded to resume the role within a month. Nonetheless he insisted on being ratified by a vote of Valencian councillors. During his time as Mayor he aimed to professionalise the city and run it \\"like a business.\\" He also acted to halt residential development in the Devesa del Saler natural park and secured the transfer of the gardens in the old course of the River Turia from the Spanish Crown to Valencia City council. He later recalled that he had ensured that when the King came to Valencia \\"He came with the River under his arm.\\" He also restored the teaching of the Valencian language in schools in Valencia city. =Democratic era= Politically and socially Francoist, he resisted the replacement of the ailing Franco by the young King Juan Carlos but nevertheless welcomed the new monarch on his first visit to Valencia city. He abstained in the vote to legalise political parties in June 1976. After the law was passed, he joined the new Spanish People's Union (Uni√≥n del pueblo espa√±ol), however, one year later, in 1977, he became a founder member of the Valencian Regional Union (Uni√≥n Regional Valenciana), the embryo of the Valencian Union (Uni√≥ Valenciana) which was formed in August 1982. He became Secretary General of Uni√≥ Valenciana (UV) in September 1982 and later served as its regional president. =National politician= He entered national politics in 1982 when he was elected to the national parliament as a deputy for Valencia province as part of a joint list between UV and the Popular Alliance. In 1986, when UV contested the election in their own right, he was re-elected, serving until 1989.

It was nominated for an Academy Award in 1988 for Best Documentary Feature.The Ten-Year Lunch Wins Documentary Feature: 1988 Oscars It was later aired on the PBS series The American Experience. Summary The film documents the nuclear tests performed around Bikini Atoll during Operation Crossroads in 1946, and their effects on the indigenous population and American servicemen involved. Interviewees * Kilon Bauno (Chief of the Bikinians) * John Smitherman, atomic veteran Production The film was produced in-part by attorney Jonathan Weisgall. In 1975, he had been sent by Covington & Burling to meet with displaced Bikini Islanders from the 1946 atomic tests. He eventually published a book on the subject, ‚ÄúOperation Crossroads: The Atomic Tests at Bikini Atoll.‚Äù Reception The Los Angeles Times wrote, ‚ÄúThe film by British film maker Robert Stone (an Oscar nominee for feature documentary) is an outstanding achievement on all levels. Stone conveys an enormous body of facts, figures, attitudes and effects in the most organically subtle fashion. There‚Äôs also a uniquely emotional quality thanks to the participation of two witnesses--Kilon Bauno, the chief of 162 Bikinians who were relocated throughout the Marshall Islands to clear the way for the nuclear invaders, and John Smitherman, a Navy pilot involved in dropping the bombs.‚Äù The Washington Post wrote, ‚ÄúStone's film is an eloquent, if harrowing, examination of the psychic and physical fallout of the testing, both on Bikinians and on unprotected American servicemen who were drenched in radioactive mists while monitoring the blasts. The most surreal footage comes from government archives -- never-before- seen film shot for a propaganda epic that was never made. Seven hundred and fifty cameras and half the world's existing movie film were shipped to Bikini to capture the Felliniesque events. Men shear lambs, grease them with Flashpoint cream and strap them to the decks of \\"target\\" ships in the Bikini lagoon to test the effects of the blasts. There is footage of uncomprehending Bikinians leaving their home, of fresh-faced sailors walking, naked, into showers jokingly labeled \\"Radio Active,\\" of military men hand- painting the name \\"Gilda\\" on a fat 20-kiloton bomb. It's all perky, upbeat -- Beaver Cleaver Drops the Bomb.‚Äù Michaela Pontellini wrote in Vancouver Weekly, ‚ÄúRadio Bikini, which is named for the temporary radio station positioned on the island shortly before Operation Crossroads began, is firmly against the destructive powers of nuclear energy. There are no interviews with anyone other than the victims of the disaster, and the focus is entirely on what is portrayed to be completely useless nuclear testing and the sheer callousness of the United States government for putting its servicemen at risk. Smitherman notes that none of the servicemen were informed as to what the tests were, nor the possible dangers of their involvement. The complete lack of consent is galling, and highlights the American governments decision to sacrifice a few for the ‚Äògreater good‚Äô.‚Äù References See also *The Atomic Cafe-the 1982 collage documentary film co-directed by producer Kevin Rafferty External links * *Radio Bikini at Robert Stone Productions *Radio Bikini at Rotten Tomatoes Category:1988 films Category:1980s documentary films Category:American Experience Category:American films Category:American documentary films Category:Bikini Atoll Category:English-language films Category:Films set in the Marshall Islands Category:Documentary films about nuclear war and weapons Category:Films directed by Robert Stone ","title":"Radio Bikini"},{"id":"20098433","text":"Impressionism is an art movement.

In particular, Canning noted that the \\"first half of the year ... had the most focus.\\" Canning said the premiere episode \\"Do-Over\\" was \\"filled to capacity with comedy\\", called \\"Se√±or Macho Solo\\" \\"near perfect\\", but said the story for the finale \\"Kidney Now!\\" was \\"fun\\" but \\"average for a season finale.\\" Alynda Wheat of Entertainment Weekly, reviewing the DVD release, gave the season an A‚àí. Jeremy Medina of Paste magazine also reviewed the premiere, saying it was \\"sort of like the first day of school after summer vacation: sort of awkward at times, but fast and buoyant and warmly familiar all the same\\". Brian Lowry of Variety was more critical, calling the third season \\"wildly uneven\\" and saying 30 Rock was \\"merely a good comedy whose shortcomings prevent it from joining the ranks of great ones.\\" The season is also noted by critics positively due to the praise of Tracy Morgan and Jack McBrayer's performance.

The show averaged 7.7 million viewers through the first ten episodes, a ratings level that Variety called \\"solid\\" and credited to pairing the show with The Office on NBC's Thursday schedule.

H. Lawrence novel The Rainbow (1915). Sammi Davis stars as Ursula, a sheltered young pupil, then schoolteacher, who's taken under the wing (sexually and otherwise) by the more sophisticated Winifred (Amanda Donohoe). Russell's film was a companion to his 1969 adaption of Lawrence's second novel about the Brangwen sisters Women in Love (1920). Glenda Jackson appears as the mother of the character she played in Women in Love (1969). Leonard Maltin commented that \\"Many beautiful and striking moments don't quite gel, but still worth watching\\". The film was entered into the 16th Moscow International Film Festival. Plot Set during the final years of England's Victorian era, Ursula Brangwen is the eldest of several children of wealthy Derbyshire farmer Will Brangwen and his wife Anna. Ursula, since age 3, has a fascination with rainbows and after one rainstorm, she runs off with a suitcase hoping to look for a pot of gold at the end of it. Will tries to ease her fascination by making her a jam sandwich with several spreads of different flavoured jam resembling a rainbow. During her teenage years, Ursula falls into a same sex romance with her older swimming and gym teacher Winifred Inger, while at the same time, Ursula also begins having romantic feelings for Anton Skrebensky, a student at the nearby boys high school who plans to enlist in the Army after graduation. Ursula and Winifred spend romantic weekends together at Winifred's house as well as hiking in the hills around the area. Winifred introduces Ursula to an artist friend of hers whom encourages Ursula to model in the nude for his paintings, and when the artist, Mac, makes sexual advances towards Ursula and refuses to pay her for her modeling, she walks out. One weekend, Ursula brings along Winifred as her chaperone when she visits her father's wealthy older brother, Uncle Henry, who becomes smitten with Winifred and, after a short courtship, proposes marriage to her. Winifred accepts which creates jealousy in Ursula. Feeling abandoned and alone after Winifred leaves her to marry Uncle Henry, and Anton goes off to fight in the Second Boer War in South Africa, Ursula decides to restart her life by becoming a school teacher. After graduation from high school, Ursula moves to London where she takes a job as a schoolmarm at a poor elementary school in the East End where she becomes quickly appalled by the lack of discipline and hygiene among the impoverished children she is forced to teach (many of whom are illiterate child laborers). She also fends off sexual advances by the lecherous headmaster of the school, who uses physical discipline to settle unruly students. Ursula initially refuses to go to that level of physical punishment for her class. But after being provoked a few too many times by one belligerent boy who uses a slingshot to pelt her with small stones, Ursula finally loses her temper and violently beats the child with a cane in full view of the class and school staff. While her violent outburst actually works to pacify her students, and makes the headmaster not to make anymore inappropriate passes at her, Ursula is guilt-ridden by her own actions and as a result, she quits her job when the school year ends. Returning to her family farm a year-and-a-half later in the spring of 1901, Ursula is reunited with Anton who is back from war and wants to rekindle a romance with her. After having a casual reunion with Winifred, who is married to Uncle Henry and now has a baby, Ursula decides to consummate her romance with Anton. At the same time, Ursula also begins working with a local miners union to help out unprivileged workers with salary and securities. When she learns that she may be pregnant, Anton proposes marriage to her, but she turns him down, wanting to follow her own path in life. After Ursula learns that she is not pregnant, Anton leaves her for good. One day, Ursula is attacked while walking home alone by two mine workers who attempt to rape her, but she escapes and spends most of the day hiding out in a rain-soaked forest, but she makes it back to her farm. There she finds a telegram from Anton who informs her he married another woman and has left the country with her for a military post in India. After a heartfelt talk with her father about life and what path it leads in life, Ursula decides to start all over again by taking another teaching position in a new town about two hours away. In the final scene, Ursula packs a suitcase and runs out of her house to chase another large rainbow that appears after a storm, just like her younger self used to in the opening scene.

He collaborated with Viv Russell and felt it would be a relatively easy film to finance because Women in Love had been such a success.Russell p 157 Russell said he was \\"well pleased\\" with the script \\"mainly due to Viv's contribution.\\"Russell p 164 He focused on the last third of the novel, the story of Ursula. Russell called it \\"a timeless parable...about a girl who won't stay within the comforting womb of her family but goes off alone to find her own way in life...This film's about saying no I won't because I'm me and not you. And it's about a woman saying that in the days they weren't supposed to.\\" \\"It's the same heroines,\\" Russell said, \\"but they're in their teens rather than in their 20s. It's them growing up and battling all the things that females of all ages have had to do throughout history.\\"At the Movies: [Review] Lawrence Van Gelder. New York Times 6 May 1988: C.8. Russell was optimistic about getting money. \\"I was back on home ground in Lawrence country. There was nude wrestling (a man and a woman this time) and stampeding animals (shire horses this time) all that lovely scenery and the usual horny miners.\\"Russell p 195 However all the major studios in Hollywood passed. So too did David Puttnam who Russell said thought the script was a \\"downer\\" and that Ursula was a \\"pain in the arse\\". Puttnam did say he would recommend it to Goldcrest Films but the director heard nothing further from him.Russell p 168 In 1983, it was reported that Russell had taken an option on the novel.THE NUCLEAR \\"AFTERMATH\\" Welsh, James M. Literature/Film Quarterly; Salisbury Vol. 11, Iss. 4, (1983): 277. In January 1984 Russell said he was unable to get finance for the film. \\"It seems to me that as the last one did well commercially this would too. But I just can't sell it anywhere. Everyone says 'it's a beautiful script but it's not commercial.' Of course they'd be saying exactly the same thing about Women in Love if I were trying to sell that now. It's so hard to find anyone with the courage to say yes to anything today.\\"MOVIES: KEN RUSSELL: OPERA HIGHS AFTER FILM LOWS Mann, Roderick. Los Angeles Times 22 January 1984: r14.

Los Angeles Times 19 April 1987: 29. However Russell's film Gothic (1986) became a big success on video, and Vestron told Dan Ireland that if Russell could come up with a horror movie, they would finance The Rainbow. He signed a three-picture deal with Vestron that included Salome's Last Dance, Lair of the White Worm and The Rainbow. Russell says the film was budgeted at ‚Ç§2.5 million but Vestron insisted he lose half a million from the budget. He rewrote the script to lose a dream sequence and a crowd sequence and decided to shoot the film within London and not the Lake District as originally planned. Russell later wrote these changes did not compromise the film - indeed he felt they tightened the script.Russell p 292-293 Vestron wanted names. They hoped Glenda Jackson would play the mother of one of the characters in Women in Love but she was on Broadway at the time. Russell offered the part to Julie Christie who turned it down. Vestron wanted Doug Savant to play the English officer but Russell did not think he was suitable. Russell wanted to work with Amanda Donohoe again but Vestron pressed for a name - Kelly McGillis, Mariel Hemingway and Theresa Russell turned it down. Catherine Oxenberg would not appear nude. Vestron agreed to Sammi Davis in the lead as they had liked her in Lair of the White Worm. Charles Dance and Jeremy Irons turned down the role of Davis' father enabling Russell to cast Christopber Gable.Russell p 292-294 Russell said Davis \\"has exactly the same characteristics as the young Glenda Jackson: a totally instinctive ability to identify with the character she is playing, an emotional directness and that undefinable quality that makes the camera love her.\\" Russell later said the character of Ursula was \\"a bit of a problem to bring off because she's a young woman who is fighting hard for her identity and she could be seen as grumbling all the time...but Sammi transcends all that.\\" Vestron refused to green light to film without names. Viv suggested Elton John who wanted to try acting and he was sent a copy of the script. In June 1988 it was announced Elton John was to play Uncle Harry.FIRE UP! . . .: [FINAL EDITION, C] Kathy O'Malley & Hanke Gratteau. Chicago Tribune 26 June 1988: 2.

Russell offered the role to Alan Bates and Oliver Reed who both turned it down before David Hemmings accepted.Russell p 305-306 Producer Ronaldo Vasconcellos called it \\"one of Ken's calmer films and I think the world is ready for it.\\" The film came out a few months after a British TV version of the novel which had a bigger budget. Davis had auditioned for the lead but been turned down in favour of Imogen Stubbs. Sammi Davis said \\"Ken couldn't be normal. But he's the best director I ever worked with: full of energy, a brilliant sense of humor. And very demonstrative, not wordy-which I like, 'cause I'm not a wordy person. The reason people probably think he's crazy is because of his films. He picks such odd subjects.\\"Riding a \`Rainbow': [Home Edition] ARKATOV, JANICE. Los Angeles Times 20 May 1989: 2. Davis appeared in the film naked in a few scenes. \\"Up till then I'd always said no,\\" she says. \\"But (nudity) was so essential to this part. That's what Lawrence is about: nakedness, physically and mentally getting down to the core of the person. That's why I felt fine about doing it.\\" References Notes * External links * Category:1989 films Category:1989 drama films Category:1980s historical drama films Category:Bisexuality-related films Category:Lesbian-related films Category:British films Category:British historical drama films Category:1989 LGBT-related films Category:British LGBT- related films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films based on works by D.

A five-time stakes winner, he was crowned 2008 Canadian Horse of the Year and Champion Sprinter.  Background and family  Bred in Florida by premier breeding farm Adena Springs, Fatal Bullet was sired by Red Bullet, the winner of the 2000 Preakness Stakes. The sire of other stakes horses such as Royal Currier, Cool Bullet, and Red Lead, his progeny have collectively earned more than $9.1 million. Fatal Bullet is out of the Regal Classic mare Sararegal, who has also produced stakes winning filly Millennia.

Racing career  = 2007‚Äì2008: early career = During his racing career, Fatal Bullet was trained by Reade Baker who has also trained stakes winners Breaking Lucky, Bear Now, and Solid Appeal, among others. Fatal Bullet ran his first six starts at Woodbine, winning his debut maiden and three allowances. He made his graded stakes debut in his third start, the 2007 Summer Stakes, finishing ninth. Fatal Bullet's first start outside of Canada came in the Woody Stephens Stakes at Belmont Park in July 2008. He finished eighth in the race. = 2008: Horse of the Year = The gelding's first stakes win came next in the listed Bold Venture Stakes, where he set a new track record for 6.5 furlongs. Following his first big win were two more- the Tom Ridge Stakes at Presque Isle Downs and the Gr.III Kentucky Cup Sprint Stakes, a race in which he set another track record of 6.5 furlongs. In his final start of 2008, Fatal Bullet contested the 2008 Gr.I Breeders' Cup Sprint at Oak Tree. Fatal Bullet finished a valiant second to champion Midnight Lute, who came back from injury to win the race for the second time, in record time. For his performances in 2008, Fatal Bullet was crowned the Sovereign Award for Canadian Champion Sprinter and Canadian Horse of the Year. Fatal Bullet also received three votes for American Champion Sprint Horse at the 2008 Eclipse Awards, with the winner being Benny the Bull. = 2009‚Äì2013: later career = Fatal Bullet's first start after the Breeders' Cup came next year in the 2009 Bold Venture Stakes, in a title defence. Fatal Bullet is one of six horses to win the Bold Venture Stakes twice. The final time, 1:14.90, was only 0.36 off Fatal Bullet's own stakes record, which Fatal Bullet had set the year before. In his next start, Fatal Bullet finished sixth in the Alfred G. Vanderbilt Handicap. The gelding's final stakes win came afterwards in the Gr.III Phoenix Stakes. Fatal Bullet again contested the Breeders' Cup Sprint, this time finishing a poor sixth to winner Big Drama. Fatal Bullet's later career consisted of several board-hitting performances in graded races, such as the Play the King Stakes, Nearctic Stakes, Kennedy Road Stakes, and Eclipse Stakes. His final win came in July 2016 in an allowance at Woodbine Racetrack. Fatal Bullet has not raced since November 2013, when he finished 8th in the Kennedy Road Stakes. He has presumably been retired.

It is a subdivision of the California Health and Human Services Agency. It enforces some of the laws in the California Health and Safety Codes, notably the licensing of some types of healthcare facilities. One of its functions is to oversee vital records operations throughout the state. On August 9, 2020, Dr. Sonia Y. Angell resigned as the CDPH Director and State Public Health Officer. Governor Gavin Newsom indicated Angell's resignation was related to data issues with the California Reportable Disease Information Exchange (CalREDIE) system that resulted in nearly 300,000 backlogged COVID-19 test results. On August 10, 2020, Sandra Shewry was appointed as acting director and Dr. Erica Pan, California state epidemiologist, was named acting state public health officer.  Medical Marijuana Program  CDPH operates the Medical Marijuana Program, tasked with issuing identification cards under Compassionate Use Act of 1996, and California Senate Bill 420.  Kids' Plates Program  CDPH administers the state's Kids' Plates program, which funds programs to protect children through the sale of customized license plates featuring one of four symbols- Heart, Hand, Star or Plus sign in the plate message. Of the proceeds, 50% supports child care licensing and inspections, 25% supports prevention of child abuse and 25% supports accidental childhood injury prevention programs.

Although CDPH eventually asked that people not use 56,000 green or 247,000 blue lunch bags, CDPH was criticized by an advocacy group for not notifying parents quickly enough of the presence of lead in the green ones.  Medical Privacy Fines, 2009  In 2009 CDPH imposed two fines totaling more than $400,000 against Kaiser Permanente hospital in Bellflower, CA, for failing to prevent unauthorized access to confidential patient information. The first fine was in May, of $250,000. It was the largest under a state law enacted following widely publicized violations of privacy involving celebrities, including Farrah Fawcett, Britney Spears and California First Lady Maria Shriver. A second fine, of $187,500, was part of an investigation into employees improperly accessing the medical records of the so-called Octomom Nadya Suleman and her children.

Office of Health Equity  The Office of Health Equity (OHE) was established, as authorized by Section 131019.5 of the California Health and Safety Code, to provide a key leadership role to reduce health and mental health disparities to vulnerable communities. The Deputy Director of the OHE reports to the Director at CDPH and works closely with the Director of Health Care Services. A priority of this groundbreaking office is building of cross-sectoral partnerships. The work of OHE is informed in part, by their advisory committee and stakeholder meetings. The office consults with community-based organizations and local governmental agencies to ensure that community perspectives and input are included in policies and any strategic plans, recommendations, and implementation activities. OHE is divided into the following three units: Community Development and Engagement Unit's mission is to strengthen the CDPH‚Äôs focus and ability to advise and assist other state departments in their mission to increase access to, and the quality of, culturally and linguistically competent mental health care and services. Policy Unit's mission is to tackle complex projects that require input and collaboration across multiple agencies and departments, most of which are not traditionally thought of as health related. Health Research and Statistics Unit (HRSU) is a leading state unit in collecting data and disseminating information about health and mental health disparities and inequities in California.

Ideological repression in arts Until the late 1920s various forms of artistic expression were tolerated. However the increase of the scope of the Soviet political repression, marked by the first show trial, the Shakhty Trial, brought into the focus of Bolsheviks the question whether \\"bourgeois intelligentsia\\", including workers of culture and arts, can be loyal to the Soviet power and can be trusted. As an early step was an instruction to the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers \\"to scourge and chastice [literature]\\" in the name of the Party\\", i.e., effectively encouraging censorship of literature on ideological grounds. Among the first targets were Yevgeny Zamiatin and Boris Pilnyak. Soon the concept of Socialist Realism was established, as the officially approved form of art, an instrument of propaganda, and the main touchstone of ideological censorship. Repression of religion Ideological repression in science Certain scientific fields in the Soviet Union were suppressed after being labeled as ideologically suspect.Loren R. Graham (2004) Science in Russia and the Soviet Union. A Short History. Series: Cambridge Studies in the History of Science. Cambridge University Press. Mark Walker (2002) Science and Ideology. A Comparative History. Series: Routledge Studies in the History of Science, Technology and Medicine. Routledge. In some cases the consequences of ideological influences were dramatic. The suppression of research began during the Stalin era and continued, in softened forms, after his regime.Loren R. Graham, Science and philosophy in the Soviet Union. New York, 1972, https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&d;=8979265 =Soviet Science during the Stalin Years= The Stalin years (1924‚Äî1953, with a big impact on the next decades) were very significant and controversial in the history of the Soviet science. On the one hand, these years are marked with a rapid industrialisation of the Soviet Union for which a great deal of research, mainly in the technical fields, has been done. On the other hand, in the Stalin times, many prominent scientists underwent repressions, purges and humilation. Under Stalin the education system would be stunted by the strict codes on proper speech and what is acceptable to discuss as a good Communist because he had the strictest rules on the matter of propriety and discussion. The Soviet Sciences Academy would be affected like all universities by the rules imposed particularly those pertaining to censorship. Not only would it be directly affected by censorship in the sense that some materials would be banned but people would be put in charge or taken out of leadership of the schools based on censorship and false accusations of improper behavior would be used in attempts to gain favor. The Soviet Science Academy ended up with a leader of the philosophy department who was placed there simply to keep the man out of trouble. The government decided to not execute or send the famous writer to the gulag because he had won the Stalin award. Doing this would have discredited the Stalin award and thus Stalin the leader of the Communist party himself. So instead, the Soviet Science Academy would have Georgy Aleksandrov work for them placing him as a department head because they believed there that he could be more easily controlled and kept within party parameters in regards to his behavior and speech. They did so because he attempted to publish works and write about topics that were considered questionable. The topic which he wanted to write about were philosophers who were not the four main Communist philosophers he wanted to mention the Western philosophers in his writings. This was decided to be inappropriate and his proposal was refused by the authorities. They then decided that it would be best to demote him from his current position of research and place him as a head of department at the Soviet Science Academy because it was considered a lesser position where he could be kept out of further mischief. Another incident which happened regarding the Soviet Science Academy during this period is that a jealous scientist would attempt to discredit two famous geneticists. These genetics had government permission to publish their findings in an American journal of science which made the Soviet Union and the Science Academy look distinguished and able to compete with the Western world. However, the scientist Trofim Lysenko would falsely accuse them of collaborations with the West and selling secrets because he wanted to gain recognition of his own and gain funding. He felt as though more money should be put into agriculture instead.Stalin and the Soviet Science Wars However, this attempt would backfire and he would be ignored even during this period of intense concern with such problems. During this era the expected move would have been to arrest the scientists but like the philosopher they were very high profile and so rather than arresting them for flimsy charges they looked into the man making the accusations and would choose instead to take a wiser and more reasonable course of action. In the Soviet Science Academy as well as in the USSR science field in general, people often used informal networks to communicate. This was true of prominent scientists such as Nikolay Zelinsky an internationally reputable organic chemist who began before the revolution and continued his work after. He was not a member of the Communist party nor did he hold a high position but he did hold discussion with scientists from across various fields of study. This meant that people knew and would support him across fields of science which was common for this period. So there was a certain amount of cooperation and working together to be found as well scientists who tried to get each other in trouble. The Soviet Science Academy would be pitted against the Communist Academy in terms of status. Both of them would compete in terms of relevancy and official recognition by the party. These organizations would struggle within the bureaucracy to gain more resources and respect during the late 1920s.David-Fox, \\"Symbiosis to Synthesis\\" Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Geschichte Osteuropas 46, 226-227 Until party leader Avel Enukidze would be placed in charge of it and he made it superior to the Soviet Academy by declaration.David-Fox, Symbiosis to Synthesis, 236-238 However, the Communist Academy would fade in the 1930s because it was seen as promoting the older Bolshevik ideals and would cease to exist ending the competition between the two. This period of completion though led to a restructuring in the Soviet Sciences Academy in order to better it so that it would not be seen as obsolete. It came close in the late 1920s to dissolving the Science Academy but would stop short of it because they decided it was important to have a singular scientific institute. The reasons for nearly destroying it had to do with the danger of thinking minds under the Soviet system and the concern that they did not uphold the right sort of ideals.David-Fox, Symbiosis to Synthesis, 243 They would decide that the Science Academy was necessary for the Soviet Empire and decided not destroy it but rather to rework the system. This would eventually lead to the Soviet Science Academy dominating as they found it continued to be useful as a way of competing with the West. The last major thing that would happen with the Soviet Science Academy would be a struggle to allow more Western ideas into the Physics Department. This obviously was in response to America having nuclear weapons and the Soviet Union realizing they needed to catch up with them. An article would be published by Vladimir Fock through the Soviet Science academy criticizing the theories of Albert Einstein because he was a Western scientist.Pollock, The Soviet Science Wars,76 However, this propagandist work was found to have shoddy science behind it and the entire department upon inspection was found to be less productive than the rest of the Science Academy. The more realistic scientific work written by Moisey Markov which agreed with Western theories would receive more support.Pollock, The Soviet Science Wars, 80 So in the beginning, with people like Aleksandrov in the philosophy department there was the idea that people should not bring up Western ideology even to criticize it and explain why Communism is better but now there is a turnaround where because beating the West is what matters good science needs to take place even if it means talking about ideas that go against principles to do so. This is because the philosophy of the West had been more important to defeat than proper research methods until the concerns about nuclear war emerged. They would decide to fire more of the department and hire more competent people because of the increased importance of nuclear research. The need for physicists would protect Jewish people from the xenophobic wrath of Stalin and Beria but not everyone would be spared for these reasons.Pollock, The Soviet Science Wars, 82-84 Still many scientists would be protected by the institute because they were seen as important to the success of the country. The Soviet Science Academy would help to play their part in the goal of the Soviet Union to surpass the military might of the United States through the use of physics and chemistry research. Important members of the scientific community were spared from Stalin's usual amount of wrath and their punishments were often lessened from what one usually would expect from the regime. In the beginning this was mainly because of ideological reasons to not harm the party by punishing someone who had received a major award or had international accreditation. Scientists were given more chances to explain their behavior or prove their innocents than average citizens because they were seen as valuable. Later, though it would be for more practical reasons as scientists became the leaders in the arms race which played a major part in the Cold War. The Soviet Science Academy would become the dominant institute where these scientists were educated and often worked. However, from 1928 on the Politburo interfered in the affairs of the Academy. By the summer of 1929, Yuri Petrovich Figatner headed a special government commission that had to inspect the Academy and purge it of \\"counter-revolutionaries,\\" turning it into a Stalinist organization. Figatner's commission originally included Sergey Oldenburg, but he was sacked for \\"obstructing the reconstruction of the Academy of Sciences\\". By the end of 1929, 128 members of staff out of 960 were fired, with a further 520 supernumeraries from 830 also dismissed. In the following year over 100 people (mainly scholars and humanists, including many historians) were charged in what is called the Academicians' Case. Former Academicians such as G.S. Gabaev, A.A. Arnoldi, Nikolai Antsiferov, had already been exiled or imprisoned, but were also put on trial. On August 8, 1931 the Board of the Joint State Political Administration Board condemned 29 people, including: * S.V. Bakhrushin * V.N. Beneshevich * D.N. Egorov * Y.V. Gautier * N.V. Izmaylov * Nikolai Likhachev * M.K. Lyubavsky * A.M. Mervart * Sergey Platonov * S.V. Rozhdestvensky * Yevgeny Tarle In 1931 the Joint State Political Administration Board imposed another wave of punishments on the research officers of various establishments of the Academy of Sciences, the Russian Museum, the Central Archives, and others. These included A.A. Byalynitsky- Birulya, A.A. Dostoevsky, B.M. Engelgardt, N.S. Platonova, M.D. Priselkov, A.A. Putilov, S.V. Sigrist, F.F. Skribanovich, S.I. Tkhorzhevsky, and A.I. Zaozersky. Some former officers, who worked for the Academy of Sciences such as A.A. Kovanko and Y. A. Verzhbitsky, were executed by shooting. N.V. Raevsky, P.V. Wittenburg and D.N. Khalturin who had organized various expeditions, the priests A.V. Mitrotsky, M.V. Mitrotsky, and M.M. Girs (the church group), Professor E.B. Furman, Pastor A.F. Frishfeld (the German group) and F.I. Vityazev-Sedenko, S.S. Baranov-Galperson and E.G. Baranov-Galperson (the publishers group) were also punished.Academics' Case, accessed July 13, 2008 Smaller commissions investigated institutions, thus the Commission for the Reorganisation of KIPS and the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography subjected these organisations to \\"socialist criticism\\".

She was the first American woman allowed to take a graduate degree at the University of G√∂ttingen in 1895. She was also the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in physics from G√∂ttingen; in fact, she was the first woman to obtain a physics Ph.D. from any German university. After she received her doctorate she worked at the newly founded Institut f√ºr Physikalische Chemie at G√∂ttingen under Walther Hermann Nernst. pp 353-354 pp. 62, 63, 65, 93, 95 Invited back to Germany in 1898 to work at the Physikalisch-Technische Reichsanstalt in Charlottenburg, Maltby was research assistant to the President, Friedrich Kohlrausch, and helped set the research methodology in the field of conductivity. After returning to the United States, Maltby studied mathematical physics with Arthur Webster at Clark University from 1899 to 1900.

Maltby was a mentor to her students, vigorously extending efforts to support their professional advancement. During her 31 years of teaching at Barnard, and the nearly 20 years that she was chair of the physics department, Maltby took a great interest in her students' learning, even introducing physics courses for non-physicists, including probably the first course in the physics of music. There are many examples of her efforts to support the professional advancement of female physicists. As chair of the American Association of University Women (AAUW) Committee on Fellowships, Maltby administered funds that supported women actively engaged in physics research during the early part of their careers. Since women were not eligible for many research fellowships because of their gender, the AAUW Fellowships were critical for maintaining a cadre of women physicists. Maltby's enormous effort contributed to the Fellowships' preservation. Despite Barnard College's Dean's Rule that stated, \\"the College cannot afford to have women on the staff to whom the college work is secondary; the College is not willing to stamp with approval a woman to whom self-elected home duties can be secondary,\\" Maltby supported women's efforts to do both. As chair of the Physics Department, she vigorously opposed the forced resignation of Harriet Brooks when she planned to marry. Physicist and History of Science interviewer Katharine Sopka wrote that her students greatly admired her. One wrote her that, \\"Professor Maltby was my mentor--a gracious lady--a friend and a counselor. Her most memorable advice to me was not to forego marriage for a career--which advice I followed and lived happily ever after.\\" pp. 11-13 Maltby never married. The first edition of American Men of Science, published in 1906, recognized her name with star to note her as one of the country's top scientists.

The quote above was the polite fiction accepted by Maltby's friends and associates in the academic world of Barnard College and Columbia University in the first half of the 20th century. And fiction it was. Autosomal DNA tests of Margaret Maltby's \\"adopted\\" son's two daughters, available at Ancestry.com., show their descent from ancestral families of Maltby's mother and of her father, evident in the DNA his daughters share with numerous other descendants of those families. It is clear that Philip Randolph Meyer was Maltby's natural son. He was born in June 1897, six months after Maltby's sudden resignation at the end of the Fall 1896 term \\"in consequence of an accident\\" from her post as Associate Professor of Physics at Wellesley College. Maltby reappeared to resume her teaching career as an instructor at Lake Erie College in September 1897. She returned to a research position in Germany in 1898, leaving her son in the care of a friend with a well fitted-out nursery. Upon her return to the United States in 1901, she was reunited with her son. She took up her post at Barnard College that same year. She spent the rest of her life in the Columbia University Morningside Heights community except for a year's sabbatical at the Cavendish Laboratory, Cambridge University, in 1910, a short-lived attempt to relocate to California for her retirement, and frequent and extensive traveling and touring.

After studying at the Honiara Technical Institute, he worked as Supervising Manager for Student Welfare Services at the Solomon Islands College of Higher Education. He then began a career in national politics, when he stood successfully for Parliament in the December 1, 2004 by-election in the Ugi/Ulawa constituency. (The by-election was prompted by MP Nathaniel Waena's elevation to the post of Governor-General.) He was re-elected in the 2006 and 2010 general elections. He first entered Cabinet in March 2005 when Prime Minister Sir Allan Kemakeza appointed him Minister for National Reconciliation, Unity and Peace, in the wake of the severe ethnic conflict on Guadalcanal. He held the post until February 2006, when he was appointed Minister for Mines and Energy. Following the April 2006 general election, he became Minister for Infrastructure and Development in Prime Minister Snyder Rini's short-lived Cabinet. Rini resigned the following month, under public pressure and in the face of an impending motion of no confidence, and Tora found himself on the Opposition benches, where he remained until Rini's successor, Manasseh Sogavare, was himself ousted in a vote of no confidence in December 2007. Tora supported new Prime Minister Derek Sikua, and was appointed Minister for Home Affairs.

He saw action during the American War of Independence and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, eventually rising to the rank of Rear-Admiral. Early life Cunningham was born in Eye, Suffolk in 1755, and after reading Robinson Crusoe at a young age, decided on a career at sea. As the country was at peace he joined a merchant ship. While serving as a seaman, the American War of Independence broke out and Cunningham joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman in 1775. He initially served aboard the 32-gun frigate , which sailed to the West Indies in early 1776, joining Sir Peter Parker's fleet. Cunningham's abilities led to him being recommended to Parker, and Parker duly transferred him aboard his flagship, . He was transferred again to the 14-gun , which was despatched to cruise off Savannah Point, Jamaica. On 8 July the Ostrich engaged a 16-gun French privateer. In the ensuing three-hour battle, both the commander and the lieutenant of the Ostrich were wounded but the French were forced to surrender, having lost 30 dead. The British casualties were four dead and 28 wounded. After his good conduct in the battle, Cunningham was appointed Acting-Lieutenant aboard the 18-gun sloop the following year. He then moved to the 28-gun sixth rate as her First Lieutenant. The Hinchinbrook was then under the command of Horatio Nelson. Cunningham remained at sea after Nelson transferred to the shore to superintend the defences of Jamaica, transferring to the 36-gun in 1780. The Pallas was ordered to escort the fleet from Jamaica back to Britain in summer 1782. During the crossing the squadron encountered a hurricane. Several of the ships were sunk and the Pallas was driven onto shore and wrecked. Fortunately Cunningham had transferred from her just before she sailed, joining . He remained in the West Indies until receiving confirmation of his promotion on 4 September, and the command of the hired brig Barrington. Command Cunningham was then sent with by Sir Joshua Rowley to interdict the American salt trade with the Bahamas. He was successful at this, but whilst re-provisioning at Jamaica, a French force landed and seized Turks Island. Alerted to this, Nelson gathered together a small squadron and set off to attempt to recapture it, relying on Cunningham's expert knowledge of the waters around the island. Nelson's force fell in with Cunningham's Barrington off the island, and together the Barrington and another of Nelson's ships, began to bombard the French positions whilst troops were landed. The two ships came under heavy fire from the entrenched French and were compelled to withdraw, having had several wounded. Nelson tried again the following day, but again failed to make much headway, and the attempt was called off. The end of the war in 1783 meant that the Barrington was paid off and Cunningham retired from active naval life. He returned to service in 1788 when he joined Admiral Sir William Cornwallis' flagship . He served for several years in the East Indies, before being promoted to commander and given command of the 16-gun sloop . He then returned to Britain. He arrived after the outbreak of war with France, and was quickly appointed to the 14-gun . He then joined Lord Hood's fleet in the Mediterranean, arriving there in April 1793. He was largely employed in carrying despatches and maintaining communications with other ships scattered throughout the Mediterranean ports. On 5 October 1793 the Speedy accompanied and into Genoa, where they captured a French frigate, the Modeste and two armed tartanes. The Captain and Speedy then sailed to the Gulf of Spezia where they caught another French frigate, the Imperieuse at anchor. The Imperieuse scuttled herself, but was subsequently salvaged and recommissioned as HMS Imperieuse. Cunningham was promoted to captain and given command of the prize, with his commission post-dated to the date of the capture, 12 October 1793. He commanded the Imperieuse until early 1794, when he transferred to . He commanded her off Corsica, helping his old commander Nelson in the reduction of the French strongholds on the island. Cunningham distinguished himself to the extent that Lord Hood entrusted him with the public despatches announcing the capture of the island, adding Cunningham was given command of , a 38-gun frigate he was to command for the next six years. He was at anchor with the fleet at the Nore when the Spithead and Nore mutinies broke out in 1797. Actions during the mutiny Escape of HMS 'Clyde' from the Nore mutiny, 30 May 1797 , by William Joy. The Clyde slips away at night, with the ships of the mutineers in the background. The red flag flies from the mainmast of the Sandwich, to the left of the picture. The Spithead and Nore mutinies were two major mutinies by sailors of the Royal Navy on various adjacent ships that broke out on 10 May 1797 and quickly spread. During the mutiny, only Cunningham aboard the Clyde and Sir Harry Burrard-Neale aboard were able to retain control over the sailors on their respective ships. By 22 May, the mutiny became more violent due to the Admiralty refusing to make any concessions. To help signal their mutinous control over the port admiral, the flag of the port admiral was torn down and replaced with the red flag. Seven days later on 29 May, the mutineer leader Richard Parker called for delegates to come from other ships to his headquarters aboard . Sensing the time was right to escape, Cunningham did not reply to Parker's request. To keep the mutineers from suspecting his plan, Cunningham kept the sails of the Clyde down and did not man the ship's wheel with a pilot. HMS 'Clyde' Arriving at Sheerness After the 'Nore' Mutiny, 30 May 1797, Joy's second painting, showing the Clyde arriving the following morning to cheering crowds. After it grew sufficiently dark, Cunningham gathered his crew at 9pm and announced his intention to escape the mutiny by sailing the Clyde out of the port in the next three hours so that they would arrive at Sheerness before daybreak. He encouraged them by declaring that if they agreed to this, Sir Harry Neale would join them with the St Fiorenzo. The crew almost unanimously agreed to this, and a single voice of dissent was quickly shouted down. At midnight, Cunningham ordered the anchor raised and the Clyde silently slipped out of the port. By daybreak, Cunningham and his ship arrived at Sheerness safely away from the mutiny. The Clyde's successful escape from the mutineers cause an atmosphere of distrust to spread among those who agreed to follow the mutineer leaders. This distrust formed the first effective blow against the ringleaders, and soon other ships were abandoning the mutinies and returning control to their respective commanders. As a result, the mutinies soon were quashed. Return to service The Clyde‚Ä≤s next duty was to escort a convoy to the Baltic. While returning from this duty the Clyde came across and captured the French privateer Success, and several days later captured the Dorade. Several men were put aboard the prize from the Clyde, but while returning to port, a gale blew up. The prize had attempted to outsail the Clyde but capsized. Cunningham stopped and lowered a boat to assist, but only four survivors were recovered. In 1798 the Clyde was used to attend on King George III during his trip to Weymouth, after which she returned to cruising in the English Channel. On 10 June 1799 she captured the French privateer schooner Air, following this up three days later by capturing the privateer Bon Ordre. On 20 August, while sailing off Cordovan, two sails were spotted in the distance. Thinking them to be a ship of the line and a frigate, Cunningham sailed closer, at which the two ships began to sail away in opposite directions. Cunningham immediately gave chase, pursuing the largest one, which turned out to be the 36-gun frigate Vestale. The Clyde brought her to battle and after an engagement of an hour forced her to strike her colours. The Vestale had lost 10 killed and 22 wounded to two killed and three wounded on the Clyde. In the meantime the other French ship, the 28-gun Sagasse had taken the opportunity to escape into port. News of the victory was communicated to shore. King George III was in the theatre when news reached him. He stood up and directed the news be communicated to the audience. There was applause and Rule Britannia! was played. The Clyde then joined Sir John Jervis and Admiral Cornwallis. She was occupied throughout the summer of 1800 conveying the artist John Thomas Serres around the French coast so that he could carry out surveys and make sketches of the headlands for charts. Cunningham was also active in capturing several Spanish privateers, and pursuing French warships. In summer 1801 Cunningham was appointed Commodore, and given command of a squadron of frigates to guard against a possible French invasion of the Channel Islands. On 21 July was wrecked on the French coast. Learning that the French intended to salvage and re-float the vessel, Cunningham sent the Clyde‚Ä≤s lieutenant, William Mounsey in with the ship's boats to burn the wreck. In this Mounsey was successful, despite being under heavy fire from French shore batteries as he did so. Promotions and flag rank With the Peace of Amiens the Clyde was paid off at the Nore on 24 June 1802. The resumption of hostilities led to Cunningham being given command of the 74-gun and sent to patrol off the Texel with a squadron. He was relieved in this post by Sir Sidney Smith, and Cunningham moved aboard . In September 1803 he was offered a place on the Victualling Board by Earl St Vincent, and moved ashore. In 1806 he became resident commissioner of Deptford and Woolwich Dockyards, which he superintended for the next seventeen years. He moved to Chatham Dockyard in 1823, and he retired from there on 4 May 1829 with the rank of Rear-Admiral. He was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Guelphic Order on 24 October 1832. In 1829 he had published his account of the events at the Nore, entitled A narrative of occurrences that took place during the mutiny at the Nore in the months of May and June 1797. Family and later years Cunningham had married twice, first to Miss Boycott, and secondly to Miss Proby. He had a number of children. His son joined the navy but died at sea in 1822. Cunningham spent the later years of his life living with his daughters at the family seat of Oak Lawn House in Eye. He died there at the age of 80 on 11 March 1834.

Elaborate cases and consoles were often featured in residence organs. In other installations, the pipes were hidden behind tapestries, under or above staircases, or spoke from the basement through grilles or tone chutes. They also made Organettes and Player Pump Organs for the \\"Working Man\\" to buy. An advertisement for the Aeolian Pianola.(1912)The pianola, a pneumatic player piano, soon after became extremely popular. It had been invented in 1895 by Edwin S. Votey, president of the Farrand & Votey Organ Company in Detroit. In 1897, Votey joined Aeolian,(December 21, 1899). Aeolian Organ Company‚Äôs purchase [of Votey Organ Company]. Hartford Courant, p. 3. Retrieved April 13, 2020 and in 1900 the firm obtained the patent for such instruments. In 1899, Aeolian took over the property and business of the Vocalian Company of Worcester, Mass. and ran it together with the Meriden plant.(December 21, 1899). Aeolian Organ Company‚Äôs purchase [of Votey Organ Company]. Hartford Courant, p. 3. Retrieved April 13, 2020 In 1903, Tremaine absorbed a number of companies making self-playing instruments, including the [Albert] Weber Co., a New York piano maker since 1852, into the Aeolian, Weber Piano & Pianola Co. In 1904 Aeolian sued the Los Angeles Art Organ Company for patent infringement of its player mechanism, leading to court victories that effectively shut down a competitor. Other patent lawsuits were not always successful. As the pianola, in its turn, was supplanted by the newer Aeolian's \\"Duo Art\\" reproducing piano (1913), which could reproduce the sound of a famous artist playing without manual intervention, the Aeolian, Weber Piano & Pianola Co. became the world's leading manufacturer of such roll-operated instruments. In 1915 the Aeolian Co. started making Vocalion phonographs and in 1917/8 started Vocalion Records, a maker of high-quality discs which in December 1924 was sold to Brunswick Records. The phonograph was one of the main factors in the demise of the player piano, although Starr made players and records as well as pianos. An attempt of the company to engage in the production of church and concert organs resulted in important installations at Duke University Chapel and Longwood Gardens. It was undermined by the Great Depression, during which the organ division was merged with the E.M. Skinner Organ Co. to become the Aeolian-Skinner Organ Co., a leading builder until the 1970s. As the popularity of the player piano faded with the rise of the phonograph and radio, the company merged in 1932 with the American Piano Company (itself a 1908 consolidation of Chickering & Sons, Knabe & Co., and other manufacturers). The combined company, known as the Aeolian-American Corporation, went through several ownership changes. For example, in 1959, ownership passed to the Heller family, owners of the former Winter and Co., in which they renamed the company to just the Aeolian Corporation. Then, in 1983, two years before declaring bankruptcy, it was sold to former Steinway president Peter Perez. Interesting enough, it is the Organettes and the Player Pump Organs that have survived today and still are collected and enjoyed by their collectors. So loved are these smaller machines, they have been restored and in fact there are places to buy recuts of the original music. On January 27, 1917, R. J. Reynolds contracted the Aeolian Company of New York for a pipe organ with four keyboards and a pedal footboard.Mayer, Barbara, Reynolda: A History of an American Country House, Winston-Salem, John F. Blair, Publisher, 1997, p. 70 Today, the organ has approximately 250 organ rolls and is played in the afternoon for visitors.Vocalion showroom, Aeolian Hall 1916234x234px = Location = Aeolian was first located at 841 Broadway, in the heart (and soul) of the piano district; the company later moved to 23rd Street, and then to 360 Fifth Avenue. Aeolian Hall (1912‚Äì13), 33 West 42nd Street, housed the firm's general offices and demonstration rooms as a recital hall on the 43rd Street side, where many noted musicians performed, and was where the first Vocalions were made. The building was sold by Aeolian in 1924. The firm's pipe-organ factory was in Garwood, N.J., until the merger with the E.M. Skinner Co. The firm returned to Fifth Avenue in 1925. The firm's facilities in the new Aeolian Building included a 150-seat recital hall, recording studios for Duo Art piano rolls, offices, design studios, drafting rooms, and a director's room in the upper stories. The Aeolian Company (as Aeolian American Corp.) remained in the Aeolian Building until 1938, after which it leased half of Chickering Hall on West 57th St.City of New York Landmarks Preservation Committee, Designation List 342 LP 2125 Page 5  Copyright law  It was Congressional suspicion of the market power of the Aeolian company during the early 20th century that prompted adoption of the first compulsory license system in U.S. copyright law, for the mechanical reproduction of musical compositions, a category that included piano rolls.Cohen, Julie E. et al. (2006). Copyright in a Global Information Economy, (p. 447). Aspen Publishers. The player piano deeply troubled popular music composers such as John Philip Sousa. Sousa worried that the pianos would kill the public's demand for sheet music, and sheet music was the source of composers‚Äô copyright royalties. To make matters worse, the player piano companies refused to pay royalties to composers for the songs they put on player piano rolls. These rolls were scrolls of paper with holes punched out in patterns that instructed the piano how to play a particular song. The rolls, argued the player piano companies, did not ‚Äúcopy‚Äù the composers‚Äô musical compositions. As a result, they were perfectly legal. The Supreme Court, in its 1908 opinion in White- Smith Music Publishing Company v. Apollo Company, sided with the player piano companies. The Court held that because humans could not read player piano rolls, they were not in fact copies of the musical compositions they encoded. The result in White-Smith lasted but a year before Congressional action. The Copyright Act of 1909 mandated that all musical compositions would be subject to a compulsory license. In short, since 1909 the copyright law has allowed musicians to copy others‚Äô songs by mechanical means (e.g., via piano roll or phonorecord/sound recording) without asking permission, so long as they paid a specified fee to the original songwriter. Anticipating that Congress was about to overturn White-Smith, Aeolian Company moved swiftly to buy up song rights from musicians and publishing companies so it could copy them onto player piano rolls. Aeolian's competitors quickly complained to Congress about Aeolian's attempt to corner the music market. Congress responded with the invention of the cover song rule.

Life and education Solomon was born on 2 April 1930 in Highland Park, Illinois.\\"Center for Creative Photography Acquires the Rosalind Solomon Archive\\", Center for Creative Photography, University of Arizona. Retrieved 21 July 2016. She graduated from Highland Park High School in 1947. She attended Goucher College in Baltimore, Maryland graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science in 1951. She married Joel W. (Jay) Solomon (1921‚Äì1984), with whom she had two children. The marriage ended in divorce. Solomon sailed to Belgium and France with The Experiment in International Living. She studied intermittently with Lisette Model from 1971 to 1977. Before photography Later Solomon became the Southern Regional Director of the Experiment in International Living. In this capacity, she visited communities throughout the Southern United States, recruiting families to host international guests and interact with other cultures in a personal way. In August 1963, Solomon traveled to Washington, D.C. for an interview with the Equal Employment Department of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which was then establishing a program for part-time recruiter‚Äìconsultants in various regions of the United States. Solomon and a group of USAID staff including Roger Wilkins (nephew of Roy Wilkins) joined the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, during which Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech. Subsequently, in her work for USAID, Solomon traveled to historically black colleges in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, and Tennessee where she spoke to students and faculty about overseas employment opportunities. Photography In 1968 Solomon's volunteer work with the Experiment in International Living brought her to Japan where she stayed with a family near Tokyo. There, at age 38, Solomon began to use an Instamatic camera to communicate her feelings and thoughts. This was the starting point for her photography practice, which also includes prose related to her life experiences. Upon her return to the United States, Solomon photographed regularly. She purchased a Nikkormat in 1969 and in the garden shed she processed 35 mm black and white film and printed her first pictures. In 1971, she began intermittent studies with Lisette Model during visits to New York City. By 1974 she was using a medium format camera. Dolls, children, and manikins were some of her first subjects, along with portraits and rituals. She works with black and white film exclusively. In 1975, Solomon began photographing at the Baroness Erlanger Hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee. She photographed people recovering from operations, wounds, and illness. In early 1977, Solomon photographed William Eggleston, his family and friends in Tennessee and Mississippi. She moved to Washington where she photographed artists and politicians for the series \\"Outside the White House\\" in 1977 and 1978. In 1978 and 1979, she also photographed in the Guatemalan Highlands.\\"Rosalind Solomon\\". Women Photographers: UCR/California Museum of Photography. Retrieved 20 July 2016. Her interest in how people cope with adversity, led her to witness a shaman's rites and a funeral and made photographs in Easter processions. In 1980, Solomon began her work in Ancash, Peru where she returned intermittently for over 20 years. She made photographs in cemeteries where damage from the 1970 Ancash earthquake was still apparent. She continued photographing shamans, cemeteries, funerals and other rituals. She also photographed people of a subsistence economy surviving the extremes of life through Catholic, Evangelist, and Indigenous rites. With a fellowship from the American Institute of Indian Studies, in 1981 Solomon began photographing festival rites in India. She found an expression of female energy and power in the forms of the goddess figures created in the sculptors' communities of Kolkata (Calcutta). In 1982 and 1983, she continued this work. While there, she photographed artists, including the painter, Ganesh Pyne and the filmmaker, Satyagit Ray. She also made portraits of the Dalai Lama and photographed Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. In 1987 and 1988, Solomon photographed people with AIDS alone, with their families, and with their lovers. The project resulted in the exhibition, Portraits in the Time of AIDS at the Grey Gallery of Art of New York University in 1988. In 1988, with concerns about the rise of ethnic violence in the world, she made her first trip to Poland. In 2003, she returned to work again in Poland. In 1988 Solomon‚Äôs interest in race relations and ethnic violence, took her to Northern Ireland, Zimbabwe and South Africa. She continued the project in 1989 and 1990 in Northern Ireland and South Africa. In the 1990s, she visited hospitals in Yugoslavia and rehabilitation centers for victims of mines in Cambodia, and photographed victims of the American/Vietnam War near Hanoi. Solomon photographed in Israel and the West Bank for five months during 2010 and 2011, part of This Place, produced by Fr√©d√©ric Brenner. She made portraits of people in Israel and the West Bank. She was photographing Palestinians in Jenin, and happened to be only a few minutes away when Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian actor and director of The Freedom Theatre, Juliano Mer-Khamis, was gunned down in April 2011.

The common name, meadow fritillary, is also used for a European butterfly species, Melitaea parthenoides. Description Underside of the wings The upperside of the wings is yellow orange with dark spots, lines, and zigzagged bands. The forewing is squared off just below the apex. A dark border on the hindwing margin is lacking on most individuals. It has long palps. The underside of the wings are mottled with orange and purplish-brown. There is a yellowish band that runs across the center of the hindwing. It lacks the silver spots most lesser fritillaries have. The forewing is smudged with orange and brown near the apex. The wingspan of the meadow fritillary is 3.5 - 5.1 cm ( - 2 inches). Similar species Similar species in the meadow fritillary's range include the silver-bordered fritillary (Boloria selene), the bog fritillary (Boloria eunomia), and the purplish fritillary (Boloria chariclea). The silver-bordered fritillary has rounder wings than the meadow fritillary, has a dark hindwing margin border, and has silver spots on the underside of the hindwing. The bog fritillary is a bit smaller than the meadow fritillary, its wing bases are hairy, and on the underside of the hindwing are a series of bands and patches which are rust red, yellow, and white. The purplish fritillary is also a bit smaller than the meadow fritillary, and the underside of the hindwings are a deep, rusty red. Habitat The meadow fritillary is frequently encountered in wet, open places, including pastures, fields, and streamsides. Life cycle The female is the active flight partner. Females deposit greenish-yellow eggs near the host plant on twigs or leaves. Mature larvae are gray and black with small, light colored spines. The chrysalis is yellow brown. The meadow fritillary overwinters as a larva. It has one or two broods per year.

It was opened in 1857 by the Banff Macduff & Turriff Junction Railway, later part of the Great North of Scotland Railway, then the LNER and finally British Railways, on the branchline from Inveramsay to Macduff, the station closed to passengers in 1951 and to goods in 1966. The station lay below Gallowhill and the town lay to the north-east. History Opened by the Banff, Macduff and Turriff Junction Railway, then part of the Great North of Scotland Railway it became part of the London and North Eastern Railway during the Grouping of 1923, passing on to the Scottish Region of British Railways during the nationalisation of 1948. It was then closed by British Railways. Infrastructure The altered station buildings in 2019 The station lay from Inveramsay and stood at above sea level.McLeish, p.20 Two signal boxes were eventually located here, designated 'South' and 'North'. They were both opened on 28 March 1892 and were closed on 28 March 1933.McLeish, p.79 The station originally had two stone built platforms with a small wooden shelter on one side and a typical brick built ticket office and waiting room on the other northbound platform. A footbridge crossed the passing loop to the north of the station buildings, and a signal box stood next to the level crossing. The signal box to the south closed in 1933, whilst the box to the north remained as a gate box for the level crossing until 1966. The passing loop and second platform, footbridge, etc were removed before passenger services ceased to reduce maintenance costs.

Its street address is 540 West Melrose, Chicago, Illinois 60657. History The congregation was founded in 1870 as Ohave Sholom (Lovers of Peace) by a group of families primarily from Mariampol, Lithuania.Ethnic Chicago: A Multicultural Portrait, By Melvin G. Holli, Peter d'Alroy Jones, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1995, p. 579 The congregation is considered to be the oldest Orthodox congregation still existing in Chicago.The Jews of Chicago: From Shtetl to Suburb, Irving Cutler, University of Illinois Press, 1996, p. 283 Anshe Sholom Bnai Israel Congregation began its long record of service to Chicago's Jews with a fight over a hat. One hot day in the summer of 1870, Duber (Dov Ber) Ginsburg, an immigrant from Mariampol, Lithuania, appeared for services at the Bais Medrash Hagodol synagogue wearing a straw hat, but the leaders of the shul took exception to its frivolity and threw him out. Offended, Ginsburg assembled a minyan from his old-country friends, and founded a competing shul, Ohave Sholom Mariampol, at Polk and Dearborn Streets. Barely a year later, the Great Chicago Fire drove many homeless Jews into their neighborhood, and membership grew rapidly. In 1892, the congregation merged with the Anshe Kalvarier shul (whose building had been demolished when 12th Street, now Roosevelt Road, was widened) and adopted the name, \\"Anshe Sholom Congregation.\\" In 1894, they retained their first Rabbi, Abraham Samuel Braude zt\\"l, who served until his death in 1907, and the shul took its place in the top rank of Chicago Jewry. It was long known unofficially as \\"the Mariampoler Shul\\" and also informally as \\"the Straw Hat Shul.\\" In 1910, two great events occurred: the congregation brought Rabbi Saul Silber zt\\"l to Chicago, and moved west into a new shul building at Polk and Ashland; a magnificent domed building by Chicago architect Alexander Levy. However, the Jewish community was moving farther west into the Lawndale district, and the Ashland neighborhood soon dried up. So they opened a branch on Homan Avenue and during the 1920s, sold the Ashland Avenue structure to a Greek Orthodox Christian congregation which still functions to this day. They soon built a grand new edifice at Independence and Polk. In that era, the West Side was called \\"Little Jerusalem,\\" and Jewish life enjoyed a golden age of growth, vigor and prosperity. It was also at this time that Rabbi Silber helped to establish the Hebrew Theological College and served without salary as its first President, while continuing his leadership of Anshe Sholom until his death in 1946. In the late 1930s, a group of members saw the potential of bringing their kind of open, welcoming Orthodoxy to the North Side, where congregations of other kinds had been thriving since 1910. They began a branch called \\"Lakeview Anshe Sholom Center,\\" and opened in 1940 in a converted greystone residence at 540 West Melrose Street. As the branch grew, the members hired a young Hebrew teacher, Rabbi Herman Davis zt\\"l, and quickly elevated him to the position of Rabbi of the congregation in 1945. More than anyone else, it was Rabbi Davis who made the Lakeview experiment a success, and built the shul into a respected center of Orthodox worship, communal life and education. Although Rabbi Davis began early to raise funds for the construction of a permanent synagogue building, he and the congregation decided to put education first, and instead saw to the construction of the school building which has since become the property of the Florence Heller JCC, directly east of Anshe Sholom. Only after this was finished was the present shul erected and dedicated, in 1959. Two more mergers brought the congregation to its present status. In 1960, the last few members of Congregation Bnai Israel gave up on Old Town, ceased operations in the 1300 block of Sedgwick Street, and the shul became \\"Lakeview Anshe Sholom Bnai Israel.\\" Two years later, the long postwar decline of the Old West Side brought an end to the main Anshe Sholom Congregation on Independence Boulevard, and it too merged, creating the present shul's name. After Rabbi Davis' death in 1975, the Congregation retained Rabbi Joseph Deitcher zt\\"l, whose able service consolidated Rabbi Davis' achievements, and proved that Anshe Sholom Bnai Israel Congregation is not the work of any one person, but rather the expression of the faith and devotion of a like-minded community which upholds Orthodox belief and practice, while confidently engaging with the modern world. After Rabbi Deitcher's death in 1994, Rabbi Asher Lopatin was brought in to be the congregation's spiritual leader.

He has consulted to, trained, or provided executive coaching to leading health care organizations, including Kaiser-Permanente Health Plan, Beth Israel-Deaconess Medical Center (Boston), and the American Medical Association. In 1992, he co-founded Health Care Negotiation Associates, a national consulting, mediating, and training organization. His has lectured across North America, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean. Work Marcus' research interests have included implications of conflict in health care services, the uses of mediation for resolving health disputes, and the contributions of conflict resolution to error prevention and patient safety. He collaborated with the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine to develop the Voluntary Mediation Program, the first initiative of its kind to mediate medical practice disputes directly between patients and physicians. In recent years, Marcus' research, teaching, and consultation have played a key role in national and international terrorism preparedness and emergency response. He is considered a pioneer in the field of health care negotiation and conflict resolution. Marcus has developed a number of practical applications of mediation and conflict resolution. Marcus has directed numerous projects intended to advance development of the negotiation, collaborative problem solving, and conflict resolution field applied to health related issues. At the Harvard School of Public Health, he has received funding support from, among others, William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the National Institute for Dispute Resolution, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to develop a curriculum, research agenda, and conceptual and applied framework for the field. =Healthcare Negotiation and Conflict Resolution= Prior to being recruited by the federal government following 9/11, Marcus' primary work was in health care negotiation and conflict resolution. Dr. Marcus is founding Director of the Program for Health Care Negotiation and Conflict Resolution at the Harvard School of Public Health. He was the lead author of the primary text in the field, Renegotiating Health Care: Resolving Conflict to Build Collaboration.Marcus, Leonard.

Other names used to describe associators were \\"Associations\\", \\"Associated\\", \\"Refugees\\", \\"Volunteers\\", and \\"Partisans\\". The term Non-Associators was applied to American colonists who refused to support and sign \\"military association\\" charters.

They can be broadly divided into the arabesque, using curving plant-based elements, geometric patterns with straight lines or regular curves, and calligraphy, consisting of religious texts with stylised appearance, used both decoratively and to convey meaning. All three often involve elaborate interlacing. The three types of ornament are often used together. Islamic decoration has had a significant influence on European decorative artforms, especially as Western arabesque. Overview Geometric Zellij tilework, stucco decoration with Arabic calligraphy and arabesques at Bou Inania Madrasa, Fes Islamic art mostly avoids figurative images to avoid becoming objects of worship. This aniconism in Islamic culture caused artists to explore non-figural art, and created a general aesthetic shift toward mathematically-based decoration. The Islamic geometric patterns derived from simpler designs used in earlier cultures: Greek, Roman, and Sasanian. They are one of three forms of Islamic decoration, the others being the arabesque based on curving and branching plant forms, and Islamic calligraphy; all three are frequently used together, in forms such as mosaic, stucco, brickwork, and ceramics, to decorate religious buildings and objects. Authors such as Keith Critchlow argue that Islamic patterns are created to lead the viewer to an understanding of the underlying reality, rather than being mere decoration, as writers interested only in pattern sometimes imply. In Islamic culture, the patterns are believed to be the bridge to the spiritual realm, the instrument to purify the mind and the soul. David Wade states that \\"Much of the art of Islam, whether in architecture, ceramics, textiles or books, is the art of decoration ‚Äì which is to say, of transformation.\\" Wade argues that the aim is to transfigure, turning mosques \\"into lightness and pattern\\", while \\"the decorated pages of a Qur‚Äôan can become windows onto the infinite.\\" Against this, Doris Behrens-Abouseif states in her book Beauty in Arabic Culture that a \\"major difference\\" between the philosophical thinking of Medieval Europe and the Islamic world is exactly that the concepts of the good and the beautiful are separated in Arabic culture. She argues that beauty, whether in poetry or in the visual arts, was enjoyed \\"for its own sake, without commitment to religious or moral criteria\\". Arabesque Stone relief with arabesques of tendrils, palmettes and half-palmettes in the Umayyad Mosque at Damascus The Islamic arabesque is a form of artistic decoration consisting of \\"rhythmic linear patterns of scrolling and interlacing foliage, tendrils\\" or plain lines, often combined with other elements. It usually consists of a single design which can be 'tiled' or seamlessly repeated as many times as desired. Geometric patterns Girih geometric pattern at the Darb-e Imam, Isfahan The geometric designs in Islamic art are often built on combinations of repeated squares and circles, which may be overlapped and interlaced, as can arabesques, with which they are often combined, to form intricate and complex patterns, including a wide variety of tessellations. These may constitute the entire decoration, may form a framework for floral or calligraphic embellishments, or may retreat into the background around other motifs. The complexity and variety of patterns used evolved from simple stars and lozenges in the ninth century, through a variety of 6- to 13-point patterns by the 13th century, and finally to include also 14- and 16-point stars in the sixteenth century. Bowl decorated with Kufic calligraphy, 10th century Geometric patterns occur in a variety of forms in Islamic art and architecture including kilim carpets, Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, muqarnas decorative vaulting, jali pierced stone screens, ceramics, leather, stained glass, woodwork, and metalwork. Calligraphy Calligraphy is a central element of Islamic art, combining aesthetic appeal and religious message. Sometimes it is the dominant form of ornament; at other times it is combined with arabesque.Department of Islamic Art. \\"Calligraphy in Islamic Art\\" In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art (October 2001) Calligraphy is used to ornament buildings such as mosques, madrasahs, and mausoleums; wooden objects such as caskets; and ceramics such as tiles and bowls. thumbSeven Western arabesque panels, Farnsborough, England. Drawings by Jules Lachaise and Eug√®ne-Pierre Gourdet, 1880-1886 Influence on Western ornament A Western style of ornament based on Islamic arabesque developed in Europe, starting in late 15th century Venice; it has been called either moresque or western arabesque. It has been used in a great variety of the decorative arts, especially in book design and bookbinding. More recently, William Morris of the Arts and Crafts movement was influenced by all three types of Islamic ornament.

Lynn was an innovator in sound technology, frequently commissioned original music, and he used popular radio and opera stars Boris Thomashefsky, Esther Field, and Seymour Rechzeit, as well as New York stage actors like Celia Adler. Biography Henry Lynn was born in the region of Bia≈Çystok, then Russian Empire, now in Poland. Frustrated by difficulties of obtaining an education in Bia≈Çystok, he emigrated to America, arriving in Boston in 1912. Initially, he taught languages in Boston and suburbs, Dorchester, Lynn, and Revere. Later he moved to New York City where he taught Hebrew and Russian, then became a film producer/director/writer, 1932-1939. During WWII Lynn created a business to manufacture plastic products for the war effort,Bridge of Light (Yiddish Film Between Two Worlds), page 323, J. Hoberman, Museum of Modern Art, Published by Shocken Books, 1991, YIVO translations and he was a news commentator on Yiddish Radio station, WEVD. Henry Lynn is survived by his daughter, Lila Lynn, who appeared as a child actress in his 1938 film, The Power of Life. Lynn's wife, Kitty Cooperman, also appeared in The Power of Life. Career From 1932 to 1939, Lynn was writer and/or producer/director of at least 10 films, emphasizing family life and the challenges to traditional values. He directed 9 films. The first two: The Intolerance of 1933 (1933), and The Youth of Russia (1934), are documentaries and contain rare footage of historical events, e.g., labor union marches in New York City in the early 1930s.Brandeis: National Center for Jewish FilmBridge of Light (Yiddish Film Between Two Worlds), page 199, J.

Hoberman, Museum of Modern Art, Published by Shocken Books, 1991, YIVO translations Lynn included Hebrew dubbing in Shir Hashirim by Tel Aviv exhibitor Ya'acov Davidon and produced some short films for theatrical shows. One example is, Papirossen by radio star Herman Yablokoff. This theatrical play was based on a current hit song, Papirosn. Lynn's short 15-minute film featured Sidney Lumet, as an 11-year-old cigarette vendor. The play and short film were booked into the Bronx McKinley Square Theatre in 1935. This was one of Henry Lynn's most unusual productions.Bridge of Light (Yiddish Film Between Two Worlds), page 208, 209, J.

Critical appraisal Mothers of Today was reviewed in 1939 by Film Daily: > Heavy tragedy, which seems to be an essential basis of all Yiddish dramas, > is done to a turn in this new film and it should please the dyed-in-the-wool > Yiddish fans. [...], the film has considerable merit. Cast members, with the > exception of the talented Esther Field, were recruited from the stage for > their initial appearance on the screen, and they give Miss Field adequate > support.

Wartime football During the war he continued to play for Southport when possible, though in 1942 it was evident that his Royal Air Force duties were getting in the way and Southport were forced to look for a replacement. Where possible he combined football with his Royal Air Force commitments and made guest appearances for Millwall, where his form was rewarded with a call up to the both the RAF representative football team and the FA XI. Post-war career Following the war he transferred to Leeds United in October 1945, for a \\"substantial\\" fee, at his own request.

The submarine was built as part of a plan to evaluate foreign submarine designs, and was the first of three boats of the class built by Whitehead & Co. of Fiume after a design by Irishman John Philip Holland. U-5 was laid down in April 1907 and launched in February 1909. The double-hulled submarine was just over long and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. U-5s design had inadequate ventilation and exhaust from her twin gasoline engines often intoxicated the crew. The boat was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in April 1910, and served as a training boat‚Äîsometimes making as many as ten cruises a month‚Äîthrough the beginning of the First World War in 1914. The submarine scored most of her wartime successes during the first year of the war while under the command of Georg Ritter von Trapp. The French armoured cruiser L√©on Gambetta, sunk in April 1915, was the largest ship sunk by U-5. The sinking of Italian troop transport ship in June 1916 with the loss of 1,926 men, was the worst naval disaster of World War I in terms of human lives lost. In May 1917, U-5 hit a mine and sank with the loss of six men. She was raised, rebuilt, and recommissioned, but sank no more ships. At the end of the war, U-5 was ceded to Italy as a war reparation, and scrapped in 1920. In all, U-5 sank four ships totaling .  Design and construction  U-5 was built as part of a plan by the Austro-Hungarian Navy to competitively evaluate foreign submarine designs from Simon Lake, Germaniawerft, and John Philip Holland.Gardiner, p. 340. The Austro-Hungarian Navy authorized the construction of U-5 (and sister ship, U-6) in 1906 by Whitehead & Co. of Fiume. The boat was designed by American John Philip Holland and licensed by Holland and his company, Electric Boat. U-5 was laid down on 9 April 1907 in the United States, partially assembled, and shipped to Whitehead's for final assembly, a process which, author Edwin Sieche notes, \\"caused a lot of trouble\\". She was launched at Fiume on 10 February 1909 by Agathe Whitehead,Agathe Whitehead, the granddaughter of Robert Whitehead, first met her future husband, Georg Ritter von Trapp, at the launching ceremony; von Trapp later became U-5s most successful commander. See: Berkowitz, p. 82, note 1. and towed to Pola on 17 August. U-5s design featured a single-hull with a teardrop-shaped body that bore a strong resemblance to modern nuclear submarines. She was long by abeam and had a draft of . She displaced surfaced, and submerged. Her two bow torpedo tubes featured unique, cloverleaf-shaped design hatches that rotated on a central axis, and the boat was designed to carry up to four torpedoes. For surface running, U-5 was outfitted with 2 gasoline engines, but suffered from inadequate ventilation, which resulted in frequent intoxication of the crew; her underwater propulsion was by two electric motors.  Service career  U-5 was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 1 April 1910, with Linienschiffsleutnant Urban Passerar in command. Over the next three years she served primarily as a training boat, making as many as ten training cruises per month. On 1 May 1911, she hosted a delegation of Peruvian Navy officers that inspected her. In June 1912, she towed a balloon as part of efforts to assess the underwater visibility of hull paint schemes. At the outbreak of World War I, U-5 was one of only four fully operational U-boats in the Austro- Hungarian Navy fleet.Gardiner, p. 341. She was initially stationed at the submarine base on Brioni, but was moved to Cattaro by late 1914.Sieche, pp. 21‚Äì22. U-5 made an unsuccessful attack on a French battleship squadron off Punta Stilo on 3 November. In December, the ship's armament was augmented by a 3.7 cm/23 (1.5 in) quick-firing (QF) deck gun, and had her first radio receiver installed. In April 1915, Georg Ritter von Trapp assumed command of U-5, and the following month, led the boat in sinking the French armored cruiser off Santa Maria di Leuca. On the night of 26 April, L√©on Gambetta was patrolling the Straits of Otranto at a leisurely without the benefit of a destroyer screen. U-5 launched two torpedoes at the French cruiser, hitting with both. The ship was rocked by the explosions of the two torpedoes and went down in ten minutes, taking down with her the entire complement of officers, including Rear Admiral Victor Baptistin S√©n√®s.Gibson and Prendergast, p. 69. Of the French ship's complement, 648 were killed in the attack; there were 137 survivors.Gardiner, p. 193. L√©on Gambetta was the largest ship of any kind sunk by U-5. In June, U-5 helped search for the lost Austro-Hungarian seaplane L 41, and in July, received an upgrade of her deck gun to a QF gun. In early August, U-5 was sent out from Lissa when the Austro-Hungarian Navy received word from a reconnaissance aircraft that an Italian submarine had been sighted at Pelagosa.von Trapp, p. 41. On the morning of 5 August, the was on the surface, moored under a cliff in the island's harbor.Halpern, p. 149. When U-5 surfaced just offshore, Nereides commanding officer, Capitano di Corvetta Carlo del Greco, cast off the lines and maneuvered to get a shot at von Trapp's boat. Nereide launched a single torpedo at U-5 that missed, after which del Greco ordered his boat submerged. U-5 lined up a shot and launched a single torpedo at the slowly submerging target, striking her, and sending her to the bottom with all hands.Stern, pp. 39‚Äì40.Stern (p. 40) reports 20 men were killed when Nereide went down; Sieche (p. 22) reports a loss of 17. The Italian captain received the Medaglia d'Oro al Valore Militare for his actions.Stern, p. 40. At the end of August, U-5 captured the Greek steamer Cefalonia as a prize off Durazzo. In late November, Friedrich Schlosser succeeded von Trapp as U-5s commanding officer. Schlosser and U-5 made an unsuccessful attack on an Italian on 7 June 1916, but the boat managed to torpedo the Italian armed merchant cruiser off Cape Linguetta on the next day. According to a contemporary account, Principe Umberto and two other ships were transporting troops and materiel under escort of two destroyers.Rider, p. 459.

The boat sank at a depth of with a loss of 6 of the 19 men on board. From 20 to 24 May the submarine was raised, and through November underwent a refit. During this reconditioning, a new conning tower was added and the deck gun was upgraded again, this time to a 7.5 cm/30 (3.0 in) gun. Upon completion, U-5 was recommissioned, but had no more war successes. In her career, U-5 sank a total of four ships totaling . After the war's end, U-5 was transferred to Venice where she was inspected by British military commissions. U-5 was later ceded to Italy as a war reparation in 1920 and was scrapped.

The submarine was built as part of a plan to evaluate foreign submarine designs, and was the second of three boats of the class built by Whitehead & Co. of Fiume after a design by Irishman John Philip Holland. U-6 was laid down in February 1908 and launched in June 1909. The double-hulled submarine was just over long and displaced between , depending on whether surfaced or submerged. U-6s design had inadequate ventilation and exhaust from her twin gasoline engines often intoxicated the crew. The boat was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy in July 1910, and served as a training boat‚Äîsometimes making as many as ten cruises a month‚Äîthrough the beginning of the First World War in 1914. The submarine had only one wartime success, which was sinking a French destroyer in March 1916. Later that year, in May, U-6 became entangled in anti-submarine netting deployed as part of the Otranto Barrage. Coming under fire from Royal Navy's drifters running the nets, U-6 was abandoned and sunk. All of her crewmen were rescued and were held in captivity through the end of the war.  Design and construction  U-6 was built as part of a plan by the Austro-Hungarian Navy to competitively evaluate foreign submarine designs from Simon Lake, Germaniawerft, and John Philip Holland.Gardiner, p. 340. The Austro-Hungarian Navy authorized the construction of U-6 (and sister ship, U-5) in 1906 by Whitehead & Co. of Fiume. The boat was designed by American John Philip Holland and licensed by Holland and his company, Electric Boat. U-6 was laid down on 21 February 1908 in the United States, partially assembled, and shipped to Whitehead's for final assembly, a process which, author Edwin Sieche notes, \\"caused a lot of trouble\\".Sieche, p. 21. She was launched at Fiume on 12 June 1909. U-6s design featured a single-hull with a tear-drop shaped body that bore a strong resemblance to modern nuclear submarines. She was long by abeam and had a draft of . She displaced surfaced, and submerged. Her two bow torpedo tubes featured unique, cloverleaf-shaped design hatches that rotated on a central axis, and the boat was designed to carry up to four torpedoes. For surface running, U-6 was outfitted with 2 gasoline engines, but suffered from inadequate ventilation, which resulted in frequent intoxication of the crew; her underwater propulsion was by two electric motors.U-6s gasoline engines were slated to be replaced by diesel engines, but this was not accomplished before the boat sank in May 1916. The two engines ordered for U-6, were instead installed in which had to be lengthened to accommodate them. See: Baumgartner and Sieche, as excerpted here (reprinted and translated into English by Sieche). Retrieved 26 November 2008.  Service career  U-6 was commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 1 July 1910, with Linienschiffsleutnant Georg Ritter von Trapp in command. Over the next three years she served primarily as a training boat, making as many as ten training cruises per month. On 7 November 1911, she hosted a Norwegian naval delegation that inspected her. On 26 June 1912, U-6 was accidentally rammed by the submarine tender Pelikan while surfacing after a deep diving trial. At the outbreak of World War I, U-6 was one of only four fully operational U-boats in the Austro-Hungarian Navy fleet,Gardiner, p. 341. and was stationed at Cattaro by late 1914. U-6s activities over the early part of the war are not reported, but the boat's armament was augmented by a 3.7 cm/23 (1.5 in) quick-firing (QF) deck gun in December 1915. Sister boat U-5 had her first radio receiver installed at the same time her deck gun was added, but it is not reported whether U-6 did, too. On 23 February 1916, U-6 made an unsuccessful attack on an Italian , but she then managed to torpedo and sink the French destroyer Renaudin on 18 March off Durazzo.Gardiner, p. 206. Renaudin went down with 47 of her 83-man complement.Rider, p. 493. On the night of 12 May, U-6 headed out to try to intercept shipping between Santa Maria di Leuca and Valona.Halpern, p. 36 Linienschiffsleutnant Hugo von Falkhausen, U-6s commander since November 1915, attempted to pass underneath two drifters that formed a part of the Otranto Barrage. While submerged, von Falkhausen heard an unexplained noise on the hull of the boat, which was likely the sound of U-6 fouling one of the anti-submarine nets deployed from the drifter Calistoga. The drifter's skipper was alerted to the submarine's presence when one of the indicator buoys had fired. Calistoga launched signal flares that attracted the attention of two nearby drifters Dulcie Doris and Evening Star II. In the meantime, von Falkhausen surfaced U-6 to try to cut loose the buoy being dragged behind his boat. When the hatch was opened, the crew discovered the boat entangled in the net.Halpern, pp. 36‚Äì37 The successful crew after the sinking of Destroyer Renaudin Though unable to submerge, von Falkhausen attempted to flee on the surface, but the port propeller shaft became fouled. Realizing that he was stuck, and with Dulcie Doris and Evening Star II beginning to shell his boat, U-6s captain ordered code books and confidential material thrown overboard and the submarine scuttled. U-6s three officers and seventeen crewmen were all rescued, but spent the remainder of the war as prisoners of the Italians. In her career, U-6 sank one ship totaling .

It is the largest power plant in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is operated by Elektroprivreda Bosne i Hercegovine (EBiH). History Construction of the first two units started in 1959. The first 32 MW unit was commissioned in 1963 and the last 215 MW unit was commissioned in 1978. There is a plan to build a new 450 MW unit by the Gezhouba Group. Description The power station has an installed electric capacity of 715 MW (without two 32 MW units) and it produces around 3.1 TWh of electricity per year. In addition, it supplies heat for Tuzla and Lukavac. The plant burns 330,000 tons of coal annually. Units 1-6 are supplied from the Kreka and Banoviƒái mines. Unit 7, at the moment, is not built.http://www.elektroprivreda.ba/upload/documents/odluke/dugorocni-plan.pdf Unit 4 has a flue gas stack, Unit 6 a flue gas stack. Background For several years a new 450 MW unit has been planned at the Tuzla coal power plant in Bosnia and Herzegovina, owned and operated by the state-owned Elektroprivreda Bosne i Hercegovine. Although it is usually cited as a replacement for existing units, Elektroprivreda BiH plans to close only the existing units 3 and 4 (total 310 MW) in 2018 and 2021 respectively, while units 5 and 6 (total 415 MW) will continue to operate until after 2030. Thus Tuzla 7 would result in additional coal capacity compared to the current situation. =Financing= An Engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract worth EUR 785 million was signed with China Gezhouba Group Co. on 30 August 2014, but it was later admitted that the plant would not be economically feasible. In May 2016 an annex to the contract was signed, which brought the cost down to EUR 722 million. Tuzla 7 lignite power plant, Bosnia and Herzegovina In December 2014 a Memorandum of Understanding on financing the facility was signed with the Exim Bank of China, and in November 2016 a framework agreement on financing was signed. On 27 November 2017, The China Exim bank and Bosnian power utility Elektroprivreda BIH signed a 613 million euro loan agreement for the Tuzla 7 lignite power plant. Rushed loan approval for Tuzla 7 coal plant, but project far from readyhttps://www.reuters.com/article/bosnia-china-loans/update-1-bosnia- secures-732-mln-energy-loan-from-chinas-exim-bank-idUSL8N1NX4BC Opposition =Environmental impacts and policies= The environmental permit for Tuzla 7 is incomplete as it does not cover the foreseen ash landfill on the ≈†iƒáki Brod site. According to Article 71 of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina's Law on Environmental Protection, an environmental permit must include measures for managing waste produced by the facility in question. (Environment of Bosnia and Herzegovina)https://bankwatch.org/project/tuzla-7-lignite-power- plant-bosnia-and-herzegovina-2 In addition, using the ≈†iƒáki Brod site as an ash landfill would contravene the Tuzla Canton and Lukavac and Tuzla municipality spatial plans, and is opposed by the Lukavac municipality council and the population living in the local communities surrounding the location. In April 2016 they presented a petition with 2100 signatures against the site to the Ministry of Environment and Tourism. The government has still no answer to all the protesters in 2019. The ash landfill if it ever gets build would destroy an whole eco system. With the ash reaching deep down to natural water springs which many local people use to drink and use, the whole area would depend on nondrinkable tap water. The ash would also directly pollute more than 150k people just around Lukavac and Tuzla. The nearby places like Plane,Bistarac,Bukinje,Brgule and Lukavac already have a problem with pollution, with the ash landfill built the area would suffer even more. And that would be hazardous for all the people living there. Drinkable water would be polluted and so as the very good land which many farmers use to grow food. =Scarce water resources= The Tuzla power plant takes cooling water from the Modrac Reservoir, the same source as much of the drinking water for Tuzla. This reservoir is fed mainly by the Turija River and the Spreƒça River; it already suffers from pollution caused by coal production and separation. If the Banovici coal power plant is built ‚Äì another project just a few kilometers away from Tuzla‚Äîit will directly compete with the Modrac Lake for water in drier periods. =Health impacts= In November 2013, the Center for Ecology and Energy from Tuzla launched a report on the health impacts of existing and planned coal thermal power plants in the Tuzla area. Using the methods developed in the World Health Organization's Health Response to Air Pollutants in Europe project, the study found that in 2013 in Tuzla existing power plants will have caused the loss of 4900 years of life, 131,000 lost working days and more than 170 hospitalizations due to cardiac and respiratory diseases. Although the Tuzla coal plant is the largest source of pollution in the area, it should be taken into account that this situation is aggravated further by the cumulative impacts with other pollution sources such as the Coke (fuel) plant and soda factory in Lukavac, thus increasing the health risks even further. Average life expectany has shortened to 51yo in places nearby. =Local protests= The air quality in Tuzla is notorious, ranked second by the World Health Organisation among Europe's most polluted towns in 2017.https://bankwatch.org/blog/protests-spread-in-western-balkans-along-with- air-pollution The legal limits for pollutants PM2.5 (fine particles) and SO2 were breached in the long winter of 2017-2018; the Clean Air Movement‚Äîa group of citizens living in Tuzla concerned about the worsening health condition as a result of air pollution exposure‚Äîtook to the streets to demand that authorities find long-term solutions to this ever-present problem. The authorities however have still no answer to all the protesters. The air pollution reached its peek in 2018 and beginning of 2019 with Air Quality Index reaching more than 500 which is by all the standards hazardous for all the people. Protests spread in Western Balkans along with air pollution 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported license.

The first title created by Genki for the 3DO platform, the game is set on a futuristic Solar System in 2095 where a war against humanity erupted with the arrival of the Kaisertian alien race, as players assume the role of an Earth Defense Force fighter pilot taking control of the mecha-style Strike space fighter craft in an effort to overthrow the invaders and end the conflict. Its gameplay mainly consists of shooting mixed alongside full motion video with sprite-based enemies imposed on them using a main two-button configuration. Headed by Sword of Vermilion director Hiroshi Hamagaki alongside Kileak: The DNA Imperative writer Manami Kuroda, Burning Soldier was created as a collaboration effort between Genki, Pack-In Video and Panasonic by most of the same team that would later work on several projects such as later entries in the Shutokou Battle franchise and future works from Genki. Though it was first launched for the 3DO, the game would later be ported to Microsoft Windows and released exclusively in Japan by Itochu Corporation on 3 April 1998, featuring very minimal changes and additions compared with the original version. Burning Soldier garnered mixed reception by critics from video game magazines and dedicated outlets that reviewed the game since its original release on 3DO, who felt mixed in regards to several aspects such as the presentation, graphics and gameplay that drew comparison with both Starblade and Star Wars: Rebel Assault due to its nature, though the music received praise by some reviewers.  Gameplay  Burning Soldier is a science fiction-themed on rails game that is primarily played in a first- person perspective inside the ship, reminiscent of Starblade, where either one or two players simultaneously assume the role of an Earth Defense Force fighter pilot taking control of the mecha-style Strike space fighter craft through 18 stages arranged into four missions, each of which ends with a boss that must be defeated to progress further, in an effort to overthrow an invading alien race known as the Kaisertians from conquering the Solar System as the main objective.Burning Soldier manual (3DO Interactive Multiplayer, US)Burning Soldier („Éê„Éº„Éã„É≥„Ç∞„ÇΩ„É´„Ç∏„É£„Éº) „É¶„Éº„Ç∂„Éº„Çπ„Éª„Éû„Éã„É•„Ç¢„É´ (Windows 95, JP) During gameplay, players must aim their reticle at incoming enemies and other hazards that appear on screen and shoot them before they hit the Strike ship to reduce its health bar. If the players are unable to destroy an enemy before it fires solid projectiles, damage can still be avoided by shooting the projectiles instead. Players can also use a charge attack by holding down the B button for approximately 1.5 seconds and then releasing it. The charge attack launches homing energy shots at all on-screen enemies, however, it cannot target projectiles or bosses. Moreover, the player cannot fire while either charging or holding a charge. All of the stages are rendered as a non-looping full motion video, including the boss stages and if the full motion video plays out before players manage to defeat the boss during this sequence, the players receive an immediate game over regardless of how much health they had left because of this. There are no extra lives, but the player has infinite continues, which allow them to resume from the beginning of the current mission.  Synopsis  Burning Soldier takes place in the year 2095, where an ancient alien race known as the Kaisertians arrived into the Solar System and began a war against mankind. The Kaisertians had previously colonized Earth tens of thousands of years before but the civilization they established there was destroyed long ago by a massive flood. The players assume the role of an Earth Defense Force fighter pilot taking control of the mecha-style Strike space fighter craft to repel the Kaisertian invasion. In the first mission, the Strike fighter pilot is sent to destroy the Kaisertian's flagship Indra, which obliterated a human colony on Mars and although the operation was a success, Earth still fell under control of the Kaisertians and as such, it prompts the Strike fighter and the Earth Defense Force with returning to Earth and counterattack the Kaisertian operation center established in Tokyo, which is under attack by a Kaisertian capital ship named Guardian. After completing the second mission, the Strike fighter and the defense forces proceed underground, where the Kaisertian's main base is located but they are quickly ambushed by one of the alien's fighter ship known as Bug. Once the ship is destroyed, the Strike fighter's final mission is to destroy the core of the Kaisertian base.  Development  Most of the artwork were first created by Tamura as hand-drawn sketches before being transpose to pre-rendered graphics. Burning Soldier was created as a collaboration effort between Genki, Pack-In Video and Panasonic by most of the same team that would later work on several projects such as later entries in the Shutokou Battle franchise and future projects from Genki. Its development was helmed by producer and Genki co- founder Hiroshi Hamagaki alongside Manami Kuroda acting as director, with Yoshinari Sunazuka being the project's sole programmer. Super Magnetic Neo director Manabu Tamura served as character designer for the game and he was also responsible for creating the computer graphics along with Hamagaki, Takashi Isoko and Mika Urushiyama. Multiple people were involved in the sound design including Scramble Cobra director Yasuki Ohno as sound producer along with Shinichi Kuroda directing the soundtrack, which was co-written by Haruhiko Nishioka and Takefumi Haketa, while the sound effects were created by Satoshi Aizato, in addition of Kiyoshi Toba and Kileak: The DNA Imperative producer Tomoharu Kimura acting as audio engineers respectively. The narration voice work was done by Nigel Hogge prior to his role in Vandal Hearts, while actress Robbie Danzie was the singer for the ending vocal track \\"Summer Leads the Way\\". Several other people were also involved in the production.  Release  Burning Soldier was first released for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. Burning Soldier was first released for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer in Japan by Pack-In-Video on 25 June 1994 and later by Panasonic across western regions. Despite its Japanese origin, the game has never been translated into Japanese, while both the Japanese and western releases are fully voice acted in English with no subtitles or story-based text of any kind. Early previews for the 3DO version before launch in publications such as the Japanese 3DO Magazine showcased a different HUD compared to the final version. On 24 September 1994, an album was published exclusively in Japan by Polydor, featuring two arranged songs co-composed by Nishioka and Haketa. On 3 April 1998, a conversion of Burning Soldier for Windows 95 was released exclusively in Japan by Itochu Corporation, featuring very minimal changes and additions compared with the original 3DO version.  Reception  Next Generation stated that \\"The graphics are fairly well done, and in its brain- dead, shoot-everything-that-moves way, it's not a bad game, but beyond that limited stimulus-response experience, there's not much gaming here.\\" They gave it two out of five stars. While he compared it unfavorably to Shock Wave, primarily due to the more simplistic gameplay, Captain Squideo of GamePro praised the game's cinematics, detailed enemies and explosions, atmospheric music, and hefty challenge when playing on the hard difficulty setting, calling it \\"a long, intense fight that'll test experienced rocket jockeys.\\" GameFan gave Burning Soldier the 1994 Golden Megawards for \\"Best Music\\" and \\"Best FMV\\".  Legacy  Three years after Burning Soldier was released to the market, Genki were reportedly working on a project intended for the Panasonic M2, which was rumored to be a rail shooter in vein of Panzer Dragoon but it was never released due to the system's cancellation.
