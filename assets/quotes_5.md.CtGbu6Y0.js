His research is based on organic chemistry and catalysis, specifically on radical cascades, sulfonium cross- coupling and copper catalysis.  Education  Procter completed his Bsc in 1992 at University of Leeds. Upon graduation, he continued to read for his Doctor of Philosophy degree with Prof. Christopher Rayner on The development of a selenoxide-based asymmetric oxidation of sulfides to sulfoxides and successfully gained his PhD in 1995.  Research and career  Procter completed his postdoctoral research with Prof. Robert Holton at Florida State University in Tallahassee, United States before moving to the University of Glasgow in 1997 as a Lecturer. In February 2004, he was promoted to the Senior Lecturer position and in September in the same year, was promoted to Reader in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Manchester. He was promoted to Professor in October 2008. Procter's research is generally on organic synthesis and catalysis chemistry and is specifically based on Radical cascades, Sulfonium cross-coupling and copper catalysis. Apart from research and lecturing, Procter has an established career fellowship (2015 - 2020) at the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and an author profile in Angewandte Chemie. Procter was also a Leverhulme Trust Research Fellow (2013 - 2014) and is the lead author of Organic Synthesis using Samarium Diiodide: A practical guide. He was the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council panel chair in March 2017, January 2013 and September 2011 and was the Head of Organic Chemistry in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Manchester from 2011 to 2014.  Notable work  Prof. Procter has carried out a wide variety of research on the efficient construction of organic molecules. In 2015, he led a research on the synthesis of novel tri- cyclic organic compounds inspired by the antibacterial, pleuromutilin via SmII-mediated radical cyclization cascades of dialdehydes, prepared by a one- pot, copper catalyzed double organomagnesium addition to Œ≤‚Äêchlorocyclohexenone. This was the first time that important analogues of the antibacterial was prepared, which previously was unable to be synthesized using the naturally occurring product. Prof. Procter has also invented metal- free coupling processes that may has decrease(d) the reliance of expensive and supply-risk transition metals. Examples include metal-free alkylation and arylation of benzothiophenes, metal-free synthesis of benzothiophenes by twofold C‚ÄìH functionalization, and new reagents for metal-free C‚ÄìH trifluoromethylthiolation in Trifluoromethyl sulfoxides.

He was an activist for human rights in Thailand and HIV protection in various countries. Wanchalearm is an alleged l√®se majest√© offender according to a report released in 2015, which claimed that he took refuge in Laos. Wanchalearm was abducted by armed men outside his home in Phnom Penh on 4 June 2020. After the news and the CCTV footage was published by Prachatai, Thai netizens and various Thais prodded the Thai and Cambodian government to take action on his disappearance.  Biography  Wanchalearm was born in Ubon Ratchathani Province and graduated from the Faculty of Political Sciences of Ramkhamhaeng University. He was a coordinator for the Youth Activity for Community and Society Centre (Y-act), and was a member of the Pheu Thai Youths Institute of the Pheu Thai Party. During the 2013‚Äì2014 Thai political crisis, he was appointed by then Deputy Prime Minister Chalerm Yubamrung as a public relations staffer. After the coup d'√©tat in 2014, he was charged for not appearing after a summons by the army junta. He was accused of l√®se majest√© in 2015. Most recently, in 2018, he was charged for a Facebook post that criticized Prayut Chan-o-cha, the prime minister and junta leader.  Abduction  Prachathai, a non-profit online newspaper in Thailand, reported that Wanchalearm was abducted in front of his condominium in Phnom Penh, Cambodia on 4 June 2020 at 17:54 ICT. A security guard attempted to help him but was dissuaded by the armed assailants. Wanchalearm was speaking on his phone when he was abducted and uttered the words \\"Ouch! I can't breathe\\" before the line was cut. Cambodian police initially declined to probe the incident and claimed to know nothing of it, dismissing it as \\"fake news\\".  Activism Most commentators thought that this was a case of forced disappearance committed by either the Thai or Cambodian government, given that Wanchalearm had been highly critical of PM Prayut on his Facebook page since the 2014 Thai coup d'√©tat. Public concern has grown since the disappearance. The United Nations Human Rights Committee told the BBC that it was following the case and was trying to force an investigation. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International both demanded the Cambodian government investigate Wanchalearm's disappearance. Cambodian authorities, on 9 June, finally relented and announced that they would investigate the disappearance. Another group that has raised concern about the matter is The Mirror Foundation, and a number of student associations have made announcements calling for the governments to take action. On 11 June 2020, the UN Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances submitted a request to the Cambodian government to take urgent action on the case. The petition was submitted in accordance with the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance, a convention ratified by Cambodia. The committee requested that Cambodia, as a state actor, submit a list of actions taken in the case by 24 June 2020. On 11 August 2020, Wanchalearm's family and Amnesty International Thailand visited the Cambodian Embassy in Bangkok and requested a meeting with the Cambodian Ambassador to Thailand, to obtain a progress report.. Thai government reaction Thirty uniformed and undercover officers arrested four Thai university students at the Democracy Monument on 9 June 2020. The students, protesting the abduction of Wanchalearm, who were tying white ribbons at public places in Bangkok to call for justice in the case. The students were charged with violation of Section 12 of the 1992 Act on the Maintenance of the Cleanliness and Orderliness of the Country, which states, \\"no one shall scrape, chip, scratch, write, spray paint or make appear by any means\\" messages in public places. Violators may be fined up to 5,000 baht. They were also cited for failure to present identification as required by the 1983 National Identity Card Act. Stopped in front of the Ministry of Defence by 10 soldiers, the activists were told that their campaign was prohibited as \\"it was symbolic\\". The Bangkok Post immediately posed the question, \\"...why police had to crack down on the symbolic activity as it was causing no damage to public property and was unlikely to cause trouble among the general public... That would appear to be a disproportionate price to pay to maintain cleanliness in the city, especially if the outcome is increased public scrutiny of government attempts to stifle freedom of speech.\\" Thai Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai said on 10 June that Wanchalearm did not have political refugee status, so Thailand could do nothing but wait for Cambodia to finish its investigation. He said that Thailand could only ask Cambodia to follow up on the case. \\"We cannot speculate as to his whereabouts until we receive an answer [from Cambodia],\\" the minister said.

His way of creating art was idiosyncratic and characterized by constant innovation and often by transformation of his medium. Later, he integrated realism into his practice.  Biography  As a young person, Gordon Rayner learned to paint from his father, a commercial artist and weekend painter, and from his father\`s close friend, Jack Bush. He spent 17 years working in commercial art, starting with Bush's commercial art firm, Wookey, Bush and Winter. An exhibition of Painters Eleven in 1955, and especially the work of William Ronald, which he visited with his friend, artist Dennis Burton, at Toronto's Hart House Gallery (today the Justina M. Barnicke Gallery, Art Museum at the University of Toronto) turned him towards abstraction. Under the influence of the neo-Dada movement current in Toronto in the late 1950s and first half of the 1960s, Rayner began to combine found materials with his paintings. Tempo, a mural by Rayner at Toronto's St. Clair West station In 1966, he began a new period in his work centred around images of Magnetawan, an area 200 miles north of Toronto, north of the Muskoka District. It provided him with a favourite painting place in which he could experiment with materials and technique while demonstrating how to refer to nature without copying it in his work. To express his feelings, he used oblique references, a thick and expressionist technique, and sometimes found objects. These paintings were intuitive reinterpretations of landscapes dramatically conceived. Rayner showed his work with Toronto's Isaacs Gallery. For this reason, he has been called part of the Isaacs Group of artists, which include, among others, Michael Snow, Joyce Wieland, John Meredith and Graham Coughtry. Rayner had numerous public commissions, among them mural Tempo (porcelain enamel on steel) for the Toronto Transit Commission, Spadina Subway line, St. Clair Station (1977). In the 1980s, his work shifted direction to a new interest in the figure. He began to reinvent this crucial subject of art for himself using dimensions of the inner, more spiritual self and obliquely explored realism in the context of the body, painting himself in inventive scenes. Some of these paintings are called the Oaxaca Suite, since Rayner lived in Oaxaca in southern Mexico in 1993 and 1994. On September 26, 2010, Gordon Rayner died suddenly at home.

She was known for portraits of sitters as prominent as her father, the Hudson River School painter James McDougal Hart and the writers William Austin Dickinson (Emily Dickinson's brother) and Zoe Anderson Norris; and for children's book and magazine illustrations. In the early 1900s she was considered \\"one of the best women artists\\" in New York.  Biography  Hart was born in 1872 in New York, the third child and second daughter of James McDougal Hart and the artist Mary Theresa Gorsuch Hart (d. 1921), who was best known for Easter Morning, a widely reproduced image of a white marble cross draped in flowers. James M. Hart's siblings included the artists William Hart and Julie Hart Beers. Mary Theresa Hart's sister, Letitia Bonnet Hart (1867-1953), was also a painter. (Their brother Robert Gorsuch Hart, a water- plant engineer, died while working in Mexico in 1906, at age 37.) The family lived at 94 First Place in Brooklyn and had a country home in Lakeville, Connecticut. Mary Theresa Hart studied at the National Academy of Design in New York and with Will Hicok Low and Edgar Melville Ward. The two sisters and their father commuted daily from Brooklyn to adjoining top-floor studios at 11 East 14th Street in Manhattan. Mary Theresa Hart often sat for portraits by her sister, offering an \\"intelligent grasp of the poses,\\" and the two women occasionally collaborated on canvases. A poem about the artist trio ended in the refrain, \\"don‚Äôt you wish that you were smart, Like James, Letitia and Mary Hart?\\" Mary Theresa Hart died in 1942 at the family's Brooklyn row house. She is buried with her family in Green-Wood Cemetery.  Exhibitions and publications  Mary Theresa Hart exhibited (often alongside her sister, uncle, and father) at venues including the American Water Color Society, Art Institute of Chicago, Louisiana Purchase Exposition, New York Water Color Club, Pan-American Exposition, and National Academy of Design--a portrait of the two sisters, painted by both of them, won the National Academy's Norman W.

Her research focuses on supernovae and their applications to cosmology. Nance is known for her use of social media, in particular Twitter, where she discusses astrophysics and activism. She is also an advocate for women's health and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  Early life and education  Nance grew up in Austin, Texas. She became interested in the solar system as a child, and used to listen to StarDate on the radio on her way home from school. She has said that her St. Stephen's Episcopal School's high school physics teacher, Frank Mikan, encouraged her love of space science. In 2016, Nance received a dual B.S. degree in physics and astronomy from the University of Texas at Austin's College of Natural Sciences. Her honors thesis was titled \\"A Theoretical Investigation of Supernovae Progenitors\\". Her advisor was J. Craig Wheeler. There she used asteroseismology to understand stars that were about to undergo a supernova. Her research focussed on Betelgeuse. Whilst an undergraduate student at the UT Austin, Nance was named a Dean's Honour scholarship and took part in a National Science Foundation summer programme at Harvard University. Career In 2017, Nance moved to the University of California, Berkeley for her graduate studies, where she investigates supernovae and uses them as a means to study both the make-up and ultimate fate of the universe. Here she earned a M.S. master's degree in astronomy, before beginning a doctoral programme. In particular, Nance studies the evolutionary state of Betelgeuse. She works with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Centre for Computational Cosmology to use supercomputers to build models of the explosions of supernovae in their final stages.  Science communication  During the first year of her undergraduate degree Nance worked as an intern at the McDonald Observatory. After starting her doctoral degree, Nance took to her science communication online. One of her viral tweets on Twitter, which highlighted how important failure was in science, was picked up by Sundar Pichai. Nance is an activist for women's health. In her early 20s it was identified that she had inherited the BRCA2 gene from her father, which is known to be a predictor of breast cancer. Nance used a crowdfunding campaign to raise money to cover the cost of a double mastectomy, and her social media platform to advocate for early and frequent testing as well as preventative medicine. After searching for the best local surgeons, Nance identified Anne Peled, a Californian reconstructive surgeon who was also a survivor of breast cancer. Nance underwent the surgery in 2019.

A total of 96 teams will compete in this division. Due to the cancellation of all non-professional competitions in the country due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal on the previous season, no teams were relegated, which lead to an additional team from each of the 20 district championships. The Portuguese Football Federation decided the creation of the Terceira Liga, a new tier in the Portuguese league system, beginning with the 2021‚Äì22 season, as well as a new format for Campeonato de Portugal, including the addition of four reserve teams invited from Primeira Liga clubs raising the total number of teams from 72 to 96. This new format will reduce the total number of teams to 56 on the next season. Format The new competition format consists of three stages. In the first stage, the 96 clubs will be divided in eight series of 12 teams, according to geographic criteria, with a maximum of two reserve teams in each series. In each series, teams play against each other in a home- and-away double round-robin system. In the second stage, the best-placed teams of each of eight Series advance to the promotion series, teams placed from second to fifth qualify for Terceira Liga qualification Series, bottom 4 teams are relegated to the District Championships and remaining teams stay in Campeonato de Portugal.

She was named Righteous Among the Nations in 1965. Early life Hautval was born in 1906 in Le Hohwald (part of modern Alsace, France). She was the youngest of seven children born to a Protestant minister father. She studied medicine at the University of Strasbourg and trained in psychiatry at various psychiatric facilities in France and Switzerland. In 1938, she returned to Le Hohwald to work in a home for handicapped children, and by 1940, when the German occupation of France began, she was working in a clinic in southwestern France. Arrest and imprisonment After learning of her mother's death in Paris in 1942, Hautval sought permission to travel to Nazi-occupied Paris to attend her mother's funeral. When her request was denied, she chose to cross into the German zone illegally; she was arrested and jailed in Bourges with a number of Jewish prisoners. She repeatedly defended the Jewish prisoners to the Gestapo and wore a sign pinned to her clothing reading \\"friend of the Jews\\" in the fashion of the yellow badges worn by Jewish prisoners. She was transferred to several transit camps for Jewish deportees, moving through Pithiviers internment camp, Beaune-la-Rolande internment camp and Fort de Romainville before arriving at Auschwitz concentration camp in January 1943 with 230 French women political prisoners. At Auschwitz, chief doctor Eduard Wirths asked Hautval to practice gynaecology; she agreed until she discovered that medical experiments were being performed on Jewish women with the intention of sterilizing them through the use of x-rays or surgical removal of the ovaries. In her barracks, she was known as \\"the saint\\" because of the medical care she provided to Jewish prisoners in secret. She was transferred to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp in August 1944, where she stayed until it was liberated by the Allies in April 1945. Later life and legacy After being liberated from Ravensbr√ºck, Hautval returned to her medical practice in France. She gave evidence in the 1964 Dering v Uris libel trial, in which Wladislaw Dering sued the novelist Leon Uris for naming him as one of the doctors performing medical experiments at Auschwitz. While Dering claimed that doctors who refused to comply with Nazi experiments would have been killed, Hautval testified that she had rejected orders from Auschwitz officials and had still survived. The British judge presiding over the trial, Justice Frederick Lawton, described Hautval as \\"perhaps one of most impressive and courageous women who had ever given evidence in the courts of this country\\". In 1965, she was honoured by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations. Hautval died by suicide in 1988. Her memoirs, which she had completed in 1987, were published posthumously in 1991 under the title M√©decine et crimes contre l'humanit√© (Medicine and Crimes Against Humanity). In 1993, the street facing the University of Strasbourg's medical clinics was renamed after Hautval. In 2015, in Paris was renamed in her memory.

He was awarded the Navy Cross during the Korean War, and he later wrote the Code of Conduct and oversaw the development of several Marine Corps museums. A two-war veteran, Colonel Nihart was a noted military historian, weapons expert, and military museum director.  Early life and World War II  F. Brooke Nihart was born on March 16, 1919, in Los Angeles, California. While he was still in high school, he joined the California National Guard. After graduating from Occidental College with a degree in political science and economics in 1940, he entered the Marine Corps' Platoon Leaders Class. Immediately assigned active duty, he graduated from The Basic School that same year, then located in Philadelphia. Short assignments in infantry units followed before the outbreak of World War II. Lieutenant Nihart then served as a gunnery officer on board the aircraft carrier USS Saratoga (CV-3), when it unsuccessfully tried to assist Wake Island immediately after Pearl Harbor in December 1941. That was followed by other shipboard and infantry-amphibious training assignments and schooling. He taught both U.S. Marine and Army units amphibious landing tactics. From April to June 1945, Major Nihart served as the executive officer of 1st Battalion, 1st Marines during the battle of Okinawa. Following that, he was assigned to the forces in North China.  Korean War  By August 1951, Lieutenant Colonel Nihart was given command of 2nd Battalion, 1st Marines, 1st Marine Division weeks prior to fighting in the last division offensive of the Korean War. By September 12, Nihart would be leading his battalion in a four day fight for Hill 749 at the Battle of the Punchbowl. Initially reported to be seized by an adjacent battalion due to a map reading error, Hill 749 was in fact not seized and proved to be the main line of resistance for an entire North Korean regiment, which had been improving its positions for months. The Marines of 2/1, thinking a passage of lines with friendly forces on 749 was imminent, instead encountered a storm of defensive fire from well entrenched, mutually supporting positions armed with artillery, mortars, and enfilading machine gun fire from the enemy's east and west flanks on ridges. The Marines would eventually clear and hold 749, but at significant expense. Throughout the night of September 15 and into the next morning, Nihart led his battalion in repulsing numerous enemy attacks and was able to maintain a defensive perimeter despite heavy casualties among his Marines. The battle was so fierce that a Marine from Nihart's battalion, Corporal Joseph Vittori, single- handedly killed 200 of the enemy with a machine gun before he was killed. Vittori was later awarded the Medal of Honor. Nihart himself was awarded the Navy Cross for his actions during the battle. In 1953, Nihart served on the Department of Defense's Advisory Committee on Prisoners of War. The committee discovered an alarming trend where prisoners of war revealed military secrets to their captors after undergoing brainwashing. Nihart was tasked with writing a code of conduct to prevent future American prisoners from revealing secrets. He ultimately wrote six articles, which President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law with an executive order on August 17, 1955.  Later career and life  In 1959, Nihart served as a military attach√© to the U.S. embassy in Rangoon, Burma. From October 1961 to July 1963, he was the commanding officer of the 7th Marine Regiment at Camp Pendleton, California, where he established a regimental history program. Nihart also frequently wrote articles for the Marine Corps Gazette. Colonel Nihart retired from the Marines in 1966 and moved to McLean, Virginia. Nihart served on the Commandant's Advisory Committee on Marine Corps History from 1968 to 1971. After serving as the managing editor for Armed Forces Journal, he was briefly recalled to active duty in 1973 to serve as the Deputy Director for Marine Corps Museums. Despite leaving the service again, he continued to fill the position as Deputy Director as a civilian, establishing the Marine Corps Museum at Washington Navy Yard in 1977. The following year he opened the Marine Corps Air-Ground Museum at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia. Nihart retired as Deputy Director in 1992 and was awarded the Distinguished Service Award by the Marine Corps Historical Foundation. Nihart was instrumental in preparing the opening of the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Triangle, Virginia, acquiring many of the vehicles and aircraft which were to be featured. He died of heart and kidney trouble on August 30, 2006, at Inova Fairfax Hospital in Falls Church Virginia. The National Museum of the Marine Corps opened just a few months later on November 10, 2006. Nihart was buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

It shows a scene from the myth of Cupid and Psyche, with a figure of Modesty standing behind Psyche and two cupids in the background placing rose crowns on a bed and throwing incense on a tripod. The work represents a return to the classical themes Greuze had abandoned after the poor reception for his The Emperor Severus Reproaching His Son Caracalla (1769). He began the work around the same time as he was commissioned to paint Innocence Led Captive by Love, another scene involving Cupid, by the comte d'Artois. However, Cupid Crowned remained incomplete, possibly due to the onset of the French Revolution, and was only exhibited publicly upon the death of the artist's daughter and heir Caroline Greuze in 1842. It was sold the following year and passed through several hands before reaching its present home in 1873 as part of a bequest by Alexandre Leleux.

He studied at the seminary in Fermo and at the Almo Collegio Capranica in Rome. In 1903 he went to the Philippines as secretary to apostolic delegation. He was serving in that post when, on 12 April 1910, Pope Pius X appointed him bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Lipa. He received his episcopal consecration on 12 June 1910 from Archbishop Ambrose Agius, Apostolic Delegate to the Philippines. On 30 May 1915, Pope Benedict XV named him to succeed Agius as Apostolic Delegate to the Philippines and made him titular archbishop of Nisibis. In 1916‚Äì17 he visited Japan to investigate the state of religious freedom, granted by the Japanese constitution but in practice the government was intolerant of non-Shinto adherents. Though the Encyclopedia says \\"a delegate apostolic, Mgr. Petrelli, was sent to Japan\\", he was not Apostolic Delegate to Japan. In 1918, when the Holy See and China agreed to exchange representatives, Petrelli was proposed as the pope's emissary, but objections from the French government, which had long exercised control over the Church in mission territories, prevented the exchange. On 27 May 1921, Pope Benedict named him Apostolic Nuncio to Peru. He resigned in 1925 at the age of 51. Petrelli died on 29 April 1962 at the age of 89.

In addition to describing the content and background of MBSR, Kabat- Zinn describes scientific research showing the medical benefits of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), and lays out an approach to mind-body medicine emphasizing the depth of the interconnections between physical and mental health. The book has been called \\"one of the great classics of mind/body medicine\\", and has been seen as a landmark in the development of the secular mindfulness movement in the United States and internationally.  Background  Full Catastrophe Living grew out of the work of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center's Stress Reduction Clinic, founded in 1979 by Jon Kabat-Zinn. The purpose of the Clinic was to \\"serve as a referral service for physicians and other health providers, to which they could send medical patients with a wide range of diagnoses and conditions who were not responding completely to more traditional treatments, or who were 'falling through the cracks' in the health care system altogether and not feeling satisfied with their medical treatments and outcomes.\\" The Clinic's Stress Reduction and Relaxation Program, later renamed mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), aimed to help patients by providing a relatively intensive training in mindfulness meditation and mindful hatha yoga. This was done through an 8-week course, which, in the words of Kabat-Zinn, Kabat-Zinn composed Full Catastrophe Living with aim of capturing \\"the essence and spirit of the MBSR curriculum as it unfolds for our patients\\", while at the same time articulating \\"the dharma that underlies the curriculum, but without ever using the word ‚ÄòDharma‚Äô or invoking Buddhist thought or authority, since for obvious reasons, we do not teach MBSR in that way.\\" Kabat-Zinn recalls his desire for the book to \\"embody... the dharma essence of the Buddha‚Äôs teachings\\" in a way that was \\"accessible to mainstream Americans\\", and to avoid \\"as much as possible the risk of it being seen as Buddhist, ‚ÄòNew Age,‚Äô ‚ÄòEastern Mysticism‚Äô or just plain ‚Äòflakey.‚Äô\\" In this connection, Kabat-Zinn experienced internal conflict over whether to include a letter of endorsement from Thich Nhat Hanh in the book's first edition, which was published in 1990. Kabat-Zinn felt that the letter \\"spoke deeply and directly to the essence of the original vision and intention of MBSR\\", but was also mindful that it \\"used the very foreign word dharma not once, but four times\\". Nhat Hanh's letter read as follows: Eventually, Kabat-Zinn decided to include the letter in his book as a preface, judging that by 1990 \\"there was no longer as big a risk of our work being identified with a ‚Äòlunatic fringe‚Äô\\", due to the scientific evidence that had already emerged for MBSR's efficacy, as well as the accelerating interpenetration of the so-called \\"counter-culture\\" with America's mainstream culture.  Publication  Full Catastrophe Living was first published in 1990 and went through numerous reprintings, before eventually being reissued in a revised second edition in 2013. The second edition refines the meditation instructions and descriptions of mindfulness-based approaches found in the first edition, and also reflects the \\"exponential\\" growth of scientific research into mindfulness and its clinical applications in the two decades after the book was first published.  Title  The title Full Catastrophe Living is derived from the film Zorba the Greek, in which the title character says, in response to being asked whether he has ever married, \\"Am I not a man? Of course I've been married. Wife, house, kids... the full catastrophe\\". According to Kabat-Zinn: Kabat-Zinn has written that his editor for the first edition of the book was concerned that including the word \\"catastrophe\\" in the title might \\"repel potential readers right from the start.\\" However, Kabat- Zinn found that the phrase Full Catastrophe Living \\"just kept coming back\\", as it seemed to touch on \\"something very special that lies within us, our capacity for embracing the actuality of things, often when it seems utterly impossible, in ways that are healing and transforming, even in the face of the full catastrophe of the human condition.\\"  Summary = Introduction  In the introduction to the revised edition of 2013, Kabat-Zinn defines mindfulness, reflects on the massive growth of MBSR and other mindfulness- based practices since the publication of the first edition in 1990, and lays out the findings of relevant scientific studies. He defines mindfulness operationally as \\"the awareness that arises by paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally\\", while noting that \\"when we speak of mindfulness, it is important to keep in mind that we equally mean heartfulness... It is a more-than-conceptual knowing. It is more akin to wisdom, and to the freedom a wisdom perspective provides.\\" He emphasizes that mindfulness involves accessing within ourselves capacities that we in fact already possess, \\"finding, recognizing, and making use of that in us which is already okay, already beautiful, already whole by virtue of our being human‚Äîand drawing upon it to live our lives as if it really mattered how we stand in relationship to what arises, whatever it is.\\" While stressing that \\"mindfulness has its own internal logic and poetry\\", he suggests that scientific research showing its beneficial effects for health and well-being may provide extra incentive to follow the MBSR curriculum. He highlights, among other research, studies using fMRI technology to show significant beneficial changes in the brain subsequent to MBSR training.  Part I: The Practice of Mindfulness  Kabat-Zinn begins this section by laying out what he sees as the foundational attitudes necessary for mindfulness practice. The attitudes Kabat-Zinn identifies - non-judging, patience, beginner's mind, trust, non-striving, acceptance, and letting go - reflect his grounding in Zen Buddhism. In particular, Kabat-Zinn emphasizes the non-instrumental nature of mindfulness practice, as in his explication of \\"non-striving\\": Kabat-Zinn's Zen training is also evident in his emphasis on non-duality, as in his explication of \\"non-judging\\", in which he stresses the limitations of all mental categorizations and judgements. The remainder of the section is devoted to a detailed description of the various meditation practices taught in the MBSR course. These practices reflect a Theravada or vipassana influence, in that they emphasize the systematic investigation of various aspects of present-moment experience. Kabat-Zinn describes at length the practices of the body scan, mindfulness of breathing, and mindful hatha yoga, as well as other practices such as walking meditation and mindfulness of daily activities such as eating. He also narrates the stories of various MBSR participants and their experiences with the practices. For instance, he tells the story of \\"Mary\\", for whom the body scan precipitated a transformative encounter with physical tensions connected with traumatic experiences from childhood, and that of a young woman for whom the walking meditation proved to be the key to overcoming her extreme anxiety.  Part II: The Paradigm  In this section Kabat-Zinn lays out the theoretical basis for his approach to health and healing, emphasizing the concepts of \\"wholeness\\" and \\"interconnectedness\\". He summarizes this approach, which he associates with mind-body and integrative medicine, as follows: Kabat-Zinn goes on to lay out the extensive scientific evidence for the close interconnection between mental and physical processes, examining the impact that attitudes such as optimism or pessimism, self- efficacy, hardiness, sense of coherence, and anger can have on physical conditions including cancer and heart disease. He also extends the concept of wholeness to stress the intimate interconnectedness of all living and non- living phenomena, approvingly quoting a letter from Albert Einstein stating that the human sense of being \\"something separated from the rest\\" is \\"a kind of optical delusion of consciousness\\".  Part III: Stress  In this section Kabat-Zinn lays out a range of scientific evidence relating to the psychological and physiological effects of stress, then goes on to describe how mindfulness practice can alleviate these effects. Drawing on the work of Richard Lazarus and Susan Folkman, he defines psychological stress in terms of the relationship between a person and their environment, which in this case is perceived as taxing or threatening. Kabat-Zinn examines both the prevalence and the deleterious effects of chronic stress within modern societies, noting that many of the automatic stress reactions common to human beings are poorly adapted to the types of problems modern people most often face. He writes: Habitual maladaptive reactions to stressors can include physical tensions, workaholism, addiction to various chemicals, drugs, or foods, and depressive rumination. Kabat-Zinn describes how mindfulness practice can help people to overcome such maladaptive reactions by bringing them into awareness, \\"allowing you to engage in and influence the flow of events and your relationship to them at those very moments when you are most likely to react automatically, and plunge into hyperarousal and maladaptive attempts to keep things under some degree of control.\\" Mindful awareness, Kabat-Zinn writes, allows us to respond to stressors wisely rather than reacting automatically, helping us to deal with stressors more effectively while also bringing \\"the comfort of wisdom and inner trust, the comfort of being whole.\\"  Part IV: The Applications  In this section Kabat-Zinn offers detailed advice for practicing mindfulness in the face of a range of specific stressors, including medical symptoms, emotional disturbance, time and work pressures, relationship issues, and stress relating to political or world events. Reflecting MBSR's origins in a medical clinic, significant space is devoted to considerations relevant to people suffering from chronic pain and other long-term health conditions. Kabat-Zinn notes that MBSR's approach to pain seems counter- intuitive to many people, as it does not involve trying to get rid of it or distracting the mind from it, but rather involves accepting and investigating the pain with compassionate attention. He writes: Kabat-Zinn describes how paying attention to pain in this way can help people to identify with it less - to see a headache as \\"just a headache\\" rather than \\"my headache\\" \\\\- and to overcome habitual maladaptive mental and physical reactions that, in the case of chronic pain in particular, can play a significant role in both the intensity and the salience of pain experiences. Kabat-Zinn describes various scientific studies showing the significant benefits of mindfulness practice for chronic pain sufferers, and illustrates these findings with the stories of MBSR patients.  Reception and influence  Subsequent to its publication Full Catastrophe Living became a global bestseller. It has been descried as a \\"landmark\\" and a \\"classic\\" in the fields of mind-body medicine and secular mindfulness, and has been cited in scholarly works more than 11,000 times. The book is generally seen as the foundational text of the mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) program, which is offered in more than 740 hospitals, clinics, and stand-alone programs worldwide. Full Catastrophe Living has also been credited with an important role in inspiring the development of other mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), including mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) and mindfulness-based pain management (MBPM).

In 1945, the unit was known as the Luftnachrichten Abteilung 350, abbreviated as OKL/Ln Abt 350 and formerly called the (). It was the successor in November 1944 of the unit formerly named as the Chi- Stelle Ob.d.L. (), which was often abbreviated to Chi-Stelle/ObdL. History Organization chart with a legend for Luftwaffe Signals Organization. As early as 1935, civilian employees of the Luftwaffe had been sent to fixed intercept stations of the German Army for training. A Luftwaffe officer, a technician and a civilian inspector who has been associated with the German Army Intelligence Service during World War I were transferred to the Luftwaffe Chi- Stelle. The two people canvassed for assistants among their old circle of acquaintances, former soldiers who had served in World War I as intercept technicians or cryptanalysts. Their numbers were no means sufficient for the task at hand.IF-180 Seabourne Report, p. 5 They consisted of people who at one time, either in civilian or military life, had received radio training or who were fluent in foreign languages. Among them were old soldiers, former seamen, professional travellers, adventurers and political refugees. In contrast to the Army, security measures taken in admitting people to the Agency were superficial, and a great number were found to be of questionable character. These trainees made training more difficult. Owing to their privileged position, they had a derogatory influence on the Luftwaffe Agency.IF-181 p. 16 In creating the Chi-Stelle, the fundamental error was committing to choosing personnel indiscriminately, without any regard to their previous training for this special work. The civilian employees had training, but no training in Chi-Stelle type of work. The first technical equipment was very deficient. Old receivers from World War I were being used, and the installation alone was a technically difficult task, and therefore naturally unsuitable for the SIS. Even the later-installed multiple dial receivers were in part improvised.IF-181, p. 11 Therefore, the importance of the Chi-Stelle in these first years remained slight, when it should have been assuming operation direction of the Luftwaffe Signal Intelligence Operation.IF-181, p. 14 A small nucleus had been assembled, with independent Luftwaffe intercept experiments begun, and by the summer of 1936, traffic from Italy, Britain, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Russian air forces had been intercepted. The training of radio operations was supervised by a small cadre obtained from the Reichswehr cypher bureau. On 1 January 1937, the agency was officially launched, under the Luftwaffe banner, with one officer and twenty civilians. It was called Chiffrier Stelle.TICOM Volume 5, p. 23 New Luftwaffe fixed intercept stations were founded in Munich, M√ºnster, and Potsdam (Eiche) in 1937 and given the cover name of Weather Radio Receiving Stations () (abbr. W-Stellen). The Luftwaffe fixed intercept stations at first monitored only the air force point-to-point networks taken over by the Army. Since in peacetime, almost all countries sent their radio traffic in plaintext, the work was simple, and direction finding was unknown.IF-181, p. 15 Personnel consisted at first of an officer in charge, two or three technicians and 30‚Äì40 civilian employees. Early training flights with the Zeppelin were carried out under the direction of the Chi-Stelle. Mobile intercept platoons were established at the same time, to operate in the field.IF-189, 403, p. 2Volume 5, p. 9 These small sections, about 10 analysts who undertook evaluation locally, corresponding to the monitoring areas of the three out-stations, were formed. The first dealt with England, France, and Belgium; the second with Italy, and the third with Russia, Poland and Czechoslovakia. To these were added a small cryptanalysis group, that was called the Chi-Stelle which served all three sections.IF-180, p. 2 The intercept stations were supplemented by direction finding stations which were called Weather Research Stations () (abbr. Wo-Stellen), after the start of World War II. The small sections were expanded into mobile Radio Intercept Companies () which collaborated with the fixed stations in the intercept of foreign air force traffic.IF-189, 403, p. 3 Relation to Luftwaffe headquarters The material sent from the out-stations to the Chi- Stelle Agency was classified according to tactical subject, and passed to the General Staff. Since, at this time, the Chi-Stelle itself was part of the General Staff, and as such was responsible for SIS planning and personnel policy, its importance in this early stage was considerable.I-180, p. 2 The intelligence passed to the General Staff was shared with the Chief of the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, and also the local air force: Luftflotte commanders. The Agency had the further duty of assigning intercept missions to the field units.Volume 5, p. 10 It soon became evident that the intelligence needs of the local air force (Luftflotte) commanders could be more quickly satisfied by having evaluation performed at a lower level than at the Agency. As a result, field evaluation centres of company strength were established and given the cover name of Weather Control Stations () (abbr. W-Leit).IF-181, p. 16 Plan for wartime organization In 1939, after several experiments at reorganization, the fixed and mobile signal intelligence units were combined into Sig Int battalions, removed from the administrative control of Chi- Stelle, and attached to Local Air Force Signal Regiments, in each case as the third battalion of what was primarily a communication regiment. Each signal intelligence battalion was composed of an evaluation unit (the W-Leitstelle), two mobile intercept companies and three fixed intercept stations.IF-189, 403, p. 4 This decentralization of LNA 350 resulted in the Chi-Stelle losing influence, especially at the outset of the war. In this organization, however, a serious mistake was made in that the above-mentioned companies were not activated immediately and taken under continuous training, as in the Army. Instead, they existed in the form of intercept platoons, which were trained by fixed intercept stations, the men being returned, after only a short period of training, to their radio companies in the Luftwaffe Signal Regiments. In this manner, a trained nucleus of personnel would have been built up before the war, as well as more than a few hundred civilian employees, which could be called upon at the start of the war. The functioning of the LNA 350 in the early months of the war was entirely to the credit of civilian employees, since it was they who had a knowledge of the activities.IF-181, p. 17 Start of World War II Growth chart of the Luftwaffe Signals Organisation from 1937 to 1945 on a per sector basis With the start of the war, the Chi-Stelle was already an organisation of some 1400 people. For a whole year prior to the war, the fixed Chi-Stelle stations had been systematically covering the air force traffic of foreign countries. Their work was complemented by revealing press reports and other sources of intelligence, the results being that the High Command, prior to the outbreak of war in September 1939, could be stated as having a quite accurate picture of the air armament, deployment, and strength of foreign air forces, as well as their organisation and expansion.IF-180, p. 4 This intelligence enabled the German Command to quickly defeat the Polish and French Air Forces during the first phase of the war. It also permitted the Chi-Stelle to closely follow the activity of the Royal Air Force (RAF), even after the commencement of hostilities, when the use of efficient cipher systems was immediately adopted. When war began, each of the Referats (departments) dealing with foreign countries had compiled an opulent background of material on the foreign air force with which it was concerned. The quantity of this material constantly increased, and was studied carefully. Each Referat maintained close contact with its corresponding sub-section in the office of Ic (Operations), while these in turn, lent the Chi-Stelle the benefit of their records and experience. The Referat exercised influence over the operations of the Intercept stations. On the other hand, preserving elasticity and processes in the conduct of operations was rendered more difficult by the profusion of Chi-Stelle and Intercept units activated at the start of World War II. Organisation At the beginning of 1938, a reorganisation of the Chi-Stelle took place. Referats (departments) were created to correspond to the subsections within the office of the Luftwaffe High Command. Thus they were newly formed or reorganised.IF-180 p. 2 * Referat A: Personnel, radio equipment of other countries, procurement of radio equipment, and liaison with the Luftwaffe Procurement Division. * Referat B: Great Britain * Referat C: France and Italy * Referat D: Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Balkans * Referat E: Cryptanalysis * Referat F: Direction finding (DF) Evaluation. Referat F disappeared from the organisation in 1940, as common DF evaluation of two countries in such widely different stages of radio development as Great Britain and the Soviet Union proved to be absurd. With the exception of a few insignificant changes dictated by the military situation, this organisation remained effective until the end of World War II. Progressive planning and innovation took place within the other Referats. After the outbreak of the war, the Referats were brought up to company strength fairly quickly, while the Chi-Stelle itself was elevated to the status of a battalion within the signals regiment serving Luftwaffe HQ.IF-180 p. 3 1940‚Äì1941= Referat A  The 17th century court stables of Frederick the Great that were used extensively by Chi-Stelle during most of World War II Immediately following the start of the Polish campaign, the Chi- Stelle moved from Berlin to the Neuer Marstall, the former riding academy of Frederick the Great in Potsdam-Wildpark. The Marstall became a sort of second name for the unit since it remained there until just before the German collapse. In other respects, the first six months of the war brought little change to its ministerial methods of working or its relatively extravagant manner of existence. Only by the middle of 1940 did the newly inducted military personnel gain ascendancy over the civil service employees in the Marstall.IF-180 p. 5 The development of the signals battalions assigned to the Luftflotte had been exploited primarily from the military point of view. Since even the signals companies assigned to the individual Fliegerkorps worked independently of the (), moulding their individual activities to conform to the requirements of the combat units they served, the decentralisation of Chi- Stelle at first seemed to be very far reaching.IF-180 p. 6 Thus in the opening phase of the war, the importance of the unit was sharply reduced. The tremendous expansion within Chi had resulted in the employment of untrained personnel, made up in part, of radio operations from the Luftwaffe Signals Corps and in part linguists from other Luftwaffe units who had been transferred into Chi. The intercept stations were placed on their own and had to be prepared to meet the demands made of them. In addition, teething problems presented themselves during the first months of the war, with types of problems that were never conceived during peace-time. For these reasons, the focal point of the Chi-Stelle quite definitely shifted to the W-Leirstellen, and to those intercept stations which were especially favourably situated and capably commanded, considering that Chi-Stelle itself was scarcely more than an administrative office. To meet this development, the unit expanded its Referats to an extent such that by the end of 1940, the Referat were almost as large as the Leitstellen. Owing solely to its relations with General Staff, it took operational control of the Leitstellen, and requests for personnel or equipment by the Leitstellen had to be approved by the Chi-Stelle. In this manner, it remained the central organisation and administrative unit of the Luftwaffe Signals Intelligence organisation. Through this mechanism, it remained in constant touch with all Chi-Stelle problems and this was especially true during the first period of the war when it was accustomed to maintain direct contact with the Leitstellen as well as each Intercept station.IF-180 p. 7 * Operational Planning: This section dealt with all planning for monitoring operations on each of the fronts. This section also prepared organisation and equipment tables and the allocation of personnel to e.g. Intercept outstations. In view of the rapid expansion of the section at the beginning of the war, this was a considerable task. * Personnel: Routine personnel matters relating to the whole section. * War Diary: An officer maintained the official War diary of the Chi-Stelle. * Research: Captured equipment was examined, repaired and put into general use. Liaison was maintained by the technicians to the Luftwaffe Office of Technical Equipment. The management of Referat A was not subject to much change. Some personnel accompanied the Chi-Stelle Chief to the Luftwaffe Advanced HQ on the Eastern Front, but the technical research section remained in Marstall. Personnel of this Referat were mostly civil service employees with a small mix of military officers and enlisted men.IF-180 p. 8  Referat B  Luftflotten was assigned to. During the interwar period, Referat B had compiled what it considered excellent records of the Royal Air Force. It possessed knowledge of the organisation, including locations of airfields, the strength of units, types of aircraft used, and a complete understanding of the RAF supply chain. After the outbreak of the war, Great Britain began to encipher its radio communication, making it harder to maintain the overall picture of the RAF. Thanks to documents captured in the first days of the war, RAF reconnaissance messages could be immediately decoded. This resulted in the creation of a tactical evaluation section which would work in closest cooperation with the Kriegsmarine and B-Dienst.IF-180 p. 9 During this period the Wireless telegraphy section was working to annihilate the RAF Fighter Command. Before the conquest of France, W-Leit 2 and its several outstations had supplied the Referat intercepts for evaluation. After the occupation of France, W-Leit 5 with outstations, was established in Oslo to monitor Scotland and the northern section. W-Leit 3, which had originally been used in the Battle of France, was transferred to Paris to monitor the RAF. The Referat was now performing the final evaluation of intercepts from the work of three SI battalions. The attention of the High Command was devoted solely to the war in the West. This was indicated by the transfer of a substantial part of the Luftwaffe General Staff to France in September 1940. In October, they were joined by the HQ of the Chi-Stelle and Referat B, which at the time was the most important section in the unit. For the Chi-Stelle staff, the placement in Paris was a short duration, as they returned to Marstall in December to plan the preparation for Operation Barbarossa. Referat B, however, remained at Asni√®res-sur-Oise until the Allied breakthrough by the Americans at Avranches forced the unit to withdraw from France.IF-180 p. 10 The move to France had a very considerable effect on the work of the Referat. Its location in the vicinity of SI battalions and intercept out-stations made for excellent cooperation. The setting in the Paris locale, enabled Referat B to adapt its work to meet the tactical and strategic requirements of the war situation. The increasing amount of intercepted material resulting from the intensive monitoring of Great Britain meant an increasing number of personnel, and by mid-1941 it had reached 60 men. The new military personnel were often excellent linguists or translators and the idea of the old civil service employee was fading. During this time, Ferdinand Feichtner, who had started training W-Leit 3 staff at the Chi-Stelle Academy in S√∂cking, was appointed Chief of Referat B. Feichtner who was supported by Colonel Gosewisch of General Wolfgang Martinis office, made certain that the Referat maintained its position in the subsequent reorganisation of the SI unit, that was made necessary by the withdrawal of W-Leit 2. Feichtner then completely reorganised Referat B internally, in regards to personnel and division of work, e.g. the best evaluators were used to create a final evaluation section to prepare for the newly-introduced monthly reports. Feichtner also created a navigational aids evaluation section.IF-180 p. 11 During the first half of 1941, an SI company was activated in Asnieres as part of the Chi battalion. It was composed of three platoons: * The first comprised the personnel of the Referat. * The second was cryptanalysts who were moved from Paris to the area to work in the Referat. * A large W/T intercept platoon was placed in a neighbouring village in the summer of 1941 to monitor traffic from the United States, using a special antenna that was erected for this purpose. This company had an average strength of 400 men. In contrast to the SI battalion, where administrative and operational command had very early been subordinated to the battalion commander, these two functions remained segregated in the Chi-Stelle until the end of the war. This may have been done to ensure the Referat's chain of command greater freedom of action, compared with other commanders. From the viewpoint of the enlisted men, many incidents, especially at the start of the war, arose from the strained relationships between military commanders and their superiors in the Referat. However, within the Chi-Stelle, the polite atmosphere of higher command was always maintained.  Referat C  After the Chi-Stelle reorganisation in 1938, Referat C became responsible for French and Italian traffic. Owing to the change in German foreign policy, monitoring of Italy gradually dwindled, until Italy joined Germany in the Axis and declared war on France on 10 June 1940. The interception of radio traffic from Italy was then forbidden by Reichsmarschall Hermann G√∂ring. From then on, Italy was monitored clandestinely and without the knowledge of G√∂ring. The interception of French traffic by W-Leit 3 bore excellent results. A regular supply of reports sent by Referat C to the General Staff and French Air Ministry documents captured by the unit bore testament to this. After the completion of the Battle of France on 25 June 1940, the work of the Referat was terminated, taking over a year to wind down.If-180 p. 12 From the start of the war, RAF overseas R/T traffic was monitored by Referat B. In the spring of 1941 and after the Balkan Campaign, the Luftwaffe started to use bases in Italy, for participating in the Battle of the Mediterranean, with a plan to establish a number of intercept stations. Accordingly, this small sub-section, that had increased in size to three men, was recalled to the Marstall in May 1941. This small group was to be the nucleus of a final evaluation centre for RAF Mediterranean and Near East traffic. For this purpose, it was increased in size by the addition of English speaking translators and evaluations from the French section. Owing to the long distances between Potsdam and the Italian Intercept stations, combined with personal problems, it was a long time before the Referat C could produce radio intelligence.If-180 p. 13  Referat D  During the interwar period, Referat D evaluated traffic intercepts from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland and the Balkan States. From 25 June 1940, after the other nation states had been conquered, the Referat worked exclusively on Soviet Union traffic, which had been considered of prime importance from the beginning. The development of sections was different compared to other Referat, due to the different structure of the unit in the east. Whereas in the west and south, cryptanalysis had been abandoned to an extent, with the main focus now being traffic analysis and W/T evaluation, in the east the majority of enciphered messages could be read. Another fundamental distinction, was that in the west, the Allies emerged with a new or revolutionary radio or radar technique, while the eastern theatre brought relatively few technical innovations. During the course of the war, the Soviet air armies developed their own particular radio procedure.IF-180 pp. 13‚Äì14 Referat D was initially stationed in the Marstall, and at the end of 1941, moved to Ruciane-Nida (Niedersee). In spring 1942, it moved with the General Staff, in preparation of large scale operations in the southern section, to ≈Ωitomir, where it was stationed until May 1943. It retreated to Warsaw at the beginning of 1944, where it established a Meldek√∂pfe, that was incorporated into the Command Post for Radio Evaluation () (ZAF). After Soviet troops overran Minsk, and began to threaten Warsaw, it moved to the university city of Cottbus. Towards the end of 1944, it merged with the regimental evaluation company of SI Regiment, East.IF-180 p. 14 Meldek√∂pfe = Organisation = Referat D sent reports directly to General Staff only during the first two years of the war. At the end of 1942, a liaison team was established in the operations office (Ic) to deal with intercepts originating in the East. The reports produced by the section were highly specialised and essentially unintelligible to the non-specialist, so they were rewritten by the liaison team. The team had 10 members, who were generally highly qualified. The Referat had a large cryptanalysis platoon attached to it, consisting of around 90 men at the height of the war. But its importance dwindled in the last years of the war, as Soviet cryptographic systems became ever more individual in character and centralised cryptanalysis of the intercept was found to be impractical.IF-180 p. 15 Also attached to the unit was a large radio intercept platoon which monitored point-to-point networks in the Soviet Union rear defence zones. An intercept company located in Rzesz√≥w forwarded intercepts by teleprinter to the Referat, who sent them to the cryptanalysis platoon to be deciphered. The second main source of the reports was teleprinted summaries from three intercepts in battalions in the east. From 1943 onwards, R/T traffic from Soviet tactical aviation units increased in significance, even being important to final evaluation. During the latter years of the war, it was particularly important in the northern sector where the availability of good landline communications limited the use of radio. = Meldek√∂pfe Warsaw = The Meldek√∂pfe in Warsaw consisted of a team of 10 specialists. As Soviet long-range bombers were active only at night, both its radio operators and evaluators alike were only occupied at night. The unit intercepted traffic on all known bomber frequencies and was reported to the nearest ZAF as an early warning. The Luftwaffe considered neither the radio discipline nor the navigation of the Soviet bomber crews to be comparable with the Allied crews in the west. The Meldek√∂pfe would report to the ZAF, and to other appropriate HQs, the exact strength, composition, and probable target of Allied bomber formations. This information was determined around the time the Soviet bombers were to cross the front lines.IF-180 pp. 15‚Äì16  Referat E  For the initial development of Referat E, i.e., supposed cryptography section, started from October 1935 until early 1939, when interpreters and translators that were newly employed by the German Ministry of Aviation were sent to fixed intercept stations of the German Army in K√∂nigsberg to monitor the Soviet Union and Baltic states, Treuenbrietzen to monitor the Soviet Union, Breslau station to intercept Czechoslovakian and Polish traffic, Munich for Italian traffic, Stuttgart for French traffic and M√ºnster for monitoring traffic in Great Britain. After a period of training, they were assigned to Luftwaffe SI stations.IF-180 pp. 16 Instruction in cryptanalysis was not provided for, nor did it take place. It was known that several civil service employees had contact with personnel within the field of cryptography and through this became familiar with its general outline. After the formation of the Luftwaffe, Chi-Stelle was created in 1939, Referat E was formed and became responsible for all cryptanalysis within the unit. In October 1938, a 4-week training course was established in Berlin for the study of cryptanalytic methods in the west. In spring 1939, a similar training course was instituted for the east, and evaluations from the fixed intercept station were ordered to attend. When World War II started, the Chi-Stelle had 15‚Äì18 decipherers, 10 of whom were familiar with the cryptology techniques used by the Allies, but none could be rated as an excellent cryptanalyst. These men were all eventually removed from the unit. Instead, to assist in the work, that was now plentiful in nature, the Chief Signal Officer assigned 50 newly inducted enlisted men to Referat E, none of whom had, had any previous training in cryptanalysis. The personnel learned their trade in practical experience rather than in theory. The development of the Referat worked by exploring in detail a new difficult cryptographic procedure while still in the Marstall, and then exporting that deciphering process to those intercept battalions or companies where the greatest amount of traffic was being intercepted. In this manner, Referat E personnel were eventually stationed all over Europe.IF-180 p. 17 The Referat expanded continually and by the end of 1942 reached its peak strength of approximately 400 men. Later policy by the German High Command meant the unit was stripped of physically-fit men for use in combat units with replacements being women auxiliaries, causing the ongoing cryptanalysis to suffer a setback. However, the more important systems were still solved up to the very end of the war, and even in the month of January 1945, the unit solved 35000 message intercepts in the west, and 15000 in the east. The chief of the Referat Ferdinand Voegele was an Inspector-Technician (), who until 1943 had no assistants who were officers, even though he was continually compelled to visit Intercept stations in the course of his work. An ongoing difficulty in the work of the Referat, which continually manifested itself, was that it had no influence on the number or location of intercept receivers covering traffic in which it was interested. This often caused delay and in some cases stalled the cryptanalysis pipeline or made it impossible.IF-180 p. 18 = Training = After a few hours of instruction, novice Luftwaffe cryptanalysts were promptly put to work on cryptographic systems, the solving of which was in various stages of advancement. After a few weeks, the novice was then shifted to a new procedure, as part of a mechanical process in a manner that would enable them in time to learn the different methods of solution. The emphasis was on breaking a cypher or code quickly, with matters of theory of secondary importance. The advantage of this method was that individuals could learn in the shortest possible time to successfully decipher certain well-known systems such as the Bomber Code and the British Main Weather Code. However, these cryptanalysts failed completely when attempting to break simple, alphabetic, unrecyphered 3 or 4-digit codes, even if an ample depth was available. The long duration of the war, gradually reduced this disadvantage since each analyst eventually had the opportunity of working on entirely different systems. In general, experience showed that men over the age of 35 years, made for below average cryptanalysts. Professional people, like academics, e.g. mathematicians and Philologists, with individual exceptions, proved unsuitable for practical deciphering work. As a rule, they exhausted themselves in laborious analytical research, only to find later that the cypher or code had already been solved. The best results were achieved with young people who had completed their high school education or had just entered a university.IF-180 p. 19 1942‚Äì1945=General The great widening of the battle front and the prodigious expenditure of men and material forced the German Command, following the first grim winter in the Soviet Union, to adopt radical economy measures. Thus, the Luftwaffe Signal Corps, that had suffered relatively slight losses, was referred to the pool of women workers for its replacements, as the men were being stripped from Luftwaffe units for the front. The importance of radar intercept, moreover, that by the middle of 1942, had finally become production ready, had become decisive to the development of the Chi-Stelle in the west and caused significant structural changes. At the same time, as German strategy swung to the defensive, the Chi-Stelle emerged as the most reliable source of radio intelligence. As the Allied air offensive unfolded, its importance to the defence of Germany became apparent, not only to the High Command, but to tactical headquarters as well, and from then on, both were concerned that its organisation become optimal. From the beginning of the war, command of the Chi-Stelle unit had changed hands frequently, with unsatisfactory leaders. The Luftwaffe General staff officer Ferdinand Feichtner who was considered to have an excellent reputation with the General Staff, took command of the unit in February 1943.IF-179, part 2, p. 27 At the same time the Chi-Stelle, at least in the west, was freed from the administrative management of the signal regiments of the Luftflotten by the creation of an independent Signals Intelligence regiment. This regiment had three battalions, one of which was devoted exclusively to radar intercept. This stronger centralisation had a favourable effect on future development. The number of impediments to which a relatively young branch of the service was inevitably subjected was considerably reduced by the excellent relations between the Commanding Office of the Chi-Stelle and the General Staffs.IF-180 p. 21 At the end of 1942, the Radar Intercept Control Centre was created in Eiche for the central evaluation of the results of radar intercept. Radar intercept centres were also brought into being at the same locations as the W-Leit of the Luftflotten, and gradually within the boundaries of Germany itself. Chi-Stelle determined policy, and planned the expansion of the Radar Intercept Service, while the development of processes was left to the out-stations and the commanders of the Referat. In this aspect, Chi-Stelle purpose was essentially one of administration and supply. The Chi-Stelle from 1943 was no longer distinguished by creative ideas. The choice of an officer with no signal or intelligence training as Director of so highly specialised a service was not a fortunate one. Briefing of the General Staff was the direct function of the Referat. Each Referat chief, in proportion to his ability, made the influence of his Referat felt on the evaluation work of his respective Leitstelle. Except for personnel and administrative matters, those Leitstellen which were capably commanded were completely independent of the Chi-Stelle. An example of this separation of concerns was that many times they even procured special signal equipment or communication facilities from the tactical units they served, rather than go through the normal Chi-Stelle channel. The Chi-Stelle also failed, when the time was right, to mould the unit into a comprehensive and exclusive organisation with its own military standards. On the contrary, in autumn 1944 when signals regiments were formed in the west, south and east, bureaucracy intervened to create two extraneous posts. The first one was a Signal Intelligence Director for administrative matters, the second new post was that of Signals Intelligence Leader (), pertaining to the defence of Germany. Organisation left The structure of Chi-Stelle was essentially the same since the beginning of the war and had developed along two main lines. Tactical evaluation from 1943, had become predominant and had resulted in the establishment of early warning and flight tracking systems. The development of tactical evaluation was fostered by the increasing strength of Allied air raids on both the occupied countries and Germany, and it far exceeded the importance of strategic evaluation. This work culminated in the creation of the ZAF [Ref 3.2.4], a central Meldek√∂pfe for the defence of the Reich. The Chi-Stelle remained both indifferent and helpless in the face of this development, with the result that the position of Chief Signals Intelligence, a parallel headquarters had to be created to manage signals matters pertaining to Germany. Secondly, the unification of the Chi-Stelle, that by 1942 had expanded into an organisation of division strength and was urgently in need of an independent administrative system in consideration of its special function, finally in 1944, proved most necessary. Discussions to solve this problem had begun in 1941, but postponed continually.IF-180 p. 22 However, since Chi-Stelle planned and supervised all signals intelligence operations from the beginning, it could easily act as its own central administrative authority. In the spring of 1944, the first of these reorganisations took place. All signal intelligence units including the Chi- Stelle which previously had been under the command of the Ministry of Aviation, were now placed under the tactical command of the Chief Signals. 3rd Division, Lt. Colonel Ferdinand Feichtner whose rank was () (General Nafue III).Volume 5, p. 12 This centralisation in tactical matters and the decentralisation in administrative affairs to the field command units led to difficulties in guidance and supply. As a result, in November 1944, after an abortive order by Hermann G√∂ring to unify all Luftwaffe signal intelligence units through combining all listening, jamming and radio traffic units as part of Air Signal Regiments, a new comprehensive organisation was finally created. This new organisation unified all home and field units into independent air signals Regiments and battalions with unit numbers ranging from 350 to 359. The administration was centralised and subordinated to a Senior Signal Intelligence Officer, Generalmajor Klemme, a veteran signals officer, who held the position of (). From 1941 to 1944 the signals intelligence battalion in the Marstall consisted of: * A company in the Marstall which comprised the personnel of Referat A, C and E. * A company in Asni√®res-sur-Oise comprising the personnel of Referat B, part of the personnel of Referat E and an intercept platoon. * A company in ≈Ωitomir, later Warsaw, comprising personnel of Referat D and a large intercept platoon and Meldek√∂pfe. * A company in Munich, Oberhaching comprising personnel of Referat B5 and an intercept platoon to monitor the United States. * An intercept company in Rzesz√≥w which monitored Soviet point to point traffic.IF-180 p. 23 After the withdrawal from France, the company in Asni√®res-sur-Oise was dissolved and Referat B greatly reduced in personnel, was migrated into the evaluation company of signals intelligence regiment west. The company in Rzesz√≥w which had moved to Namslau in the middle of 1944, was transferred to the signals intelligence regiment east, and for practical purposes, it already belonged. Referat D was incorporated into the evaluation company of this regiment when the latter left Cottbus and retreated to the southwest while under attack from the Soviet advance. In February 1945, the Marstall was abandoned. In the autumn of 1944, the Chi-Stelle battalion, as had been the case with of all signals intelligence battalions, became independent of the Luftwaffe Signal Corps Regiment to which it had been assigned. Command was taken over by a captain who was given the prerogatives of a regimental commander. It was renamed Air Intelligence Department 350 () and retained its previous function of planning for the entire Luftwaffe signals intelligence infrastructure. In reality, the command structure, and unit organisation had not changed at all, in spite of the battalion commander, Captain Jordens, the administrative chief, General Klemme, and the Funkaufkl√§rungsf√ºhrer Reich, Colonel Forster, Lt. Colonel Ferdinand Feichtner as the representative of the Chief Signal Officer, remained the supreme authority until the end of the unit. Liaison The Referats were the supreme authority on all evaluation questions arising between the regiments, battalions and the Chi-Stelle. They furnished intelligence directly to the General Staff where a liaison officer had been assigned since 1942.IF-180 p. 24 Section II of the Office of the Chief Signal Officer only had communication with individual units insofar as to pass the orders. The final preparation of reports decided by Referat. The responsibility for distribution of the reports was decided by the Chi-Stelle Director who acted in consultation with the Chief Signal officer. Liaison with B-Dienst, the Kriegsmarine cipher bureau and General der Nachrichtenaufkl√§rung, the German Army cipher bureau, as well as the Radio Defense Corps was carried out at both the level of the Referat and at the Leitstellen, which exchanged reports with Navy and Army cipher bureaux located in their respective areas. However, owing to the extreme secrecy which surrounded all activity at the unit, the process of exchange was not perfect. For example, the liaison between the Luftwaffe and the Radio Defense Corps regarding Yugoslav Partisan activity in the Balkans was founded on the relationship between two Leutnants, who despite instructions to the contrary, exchanged intelligence on this subject.IF-180, p. 24 The three cypher bureau () exchanged reports, and in the case of the Luftwaffe, these were studied by the individual Referat. From 1942, a liaison officer from Referat B was assigned to the Army Chi-Stelle in Saint-Germain-en-Laye but no special benefits were derived from this close association. Chi-Stelle decided the extent of co-operation and liaison between Germany's allies, but the execution of process was decided by the signals intelligence units located in the various countries. The Finland cypher bureau, the Signals Intelligence Office () was the only bureau within the Axis, that compared with Germany in terms of quality and had made excellent progress on the cryptanalysis of Soviet (Russian) systems.IF-180, p. 25 Liaison with Japan did not exist, and contact with the Japanese on-air signal intelligence could only take place through the General der Nachrichtenaufkl√§rung, that received the monthly reports of the unit. It would seem probable that the Japanese signals bureau would be interested in reports of special fields, such as the 8th USAAF or Allied navigational procedures, that would have been furnished by the GDNA. In the last year of the war, and at the request of the Japanese, it was intended to send a German mission, comprising medium frequency and high frequency specialists to Japan. Strangely the Japanese were not interested in VHF or radar interception and jamming. Referat A When the Chi-Stelle was taken over by General Staff officer, Ferdinand Feichtner in the spring of 1942, it resulted in the Lietstellen being supported in a previously unaccustomed manner. In order to meet the increasing demands within the unit for personnel and equipment, the Chi-Stelle initiated a strict management control policy. The development and procurement of radio receivers was also problematic and involved negotiations with the manufacturers, who with long supply chains demanded notification of orders long in advance. Problems with personnel bounded, with the personnel officer whose only experience was the Eastern Front, while Rudolf Friedrich's staff did not have one officer who had experience of working against the Anglo-American Allies.IF-180, p. 26 Therefore, the Chi-Stelle command had little understanding of the problems existing in the west and south. The problems were compounded by individuals who lacked tactical experience, particularly Captain Trattner, Commander of Radar Intercept at LN Abteilung 356, who was a professor of electronics. It can be stated that Referat A had a short-sighted policy as regard to personnel, as well as an indecisive and dilatory manner when it needed to handle personnel problems affecting the entire unit. Referat BGeneral= In contrast to other units and sections of the Chi-Stelle, Referat B maintained a constant and purposeful policy towards its own personnel. When the former Director of the unit was ordered back to the Marstall in mid-1942, his place was taken by a career officer who removed the last vestiges of the civil service regime from the Referat.IF-180, p. 27 Daily conferences and a number of experienced combat officers were brought in and employed to advise the evaluations in the various desks. The personnel of the Referat were now continuously trained and were accorded all privileges possible with military functions, such as drilling kept to the minimum. As a result, morale in the unit was considered excellent. At the end of 1942, some of the personnel were replaced by women auxiliaries. Shortly before the Normandy landings, the Referat consisted of 4 officers, 3 technicians, 45 enlisted me, and 25 auxiliaries. After the withdrawal from France in August 1944, the Referat was merged with the evaluation company of Signal Regiment West. Personnel were reduced by more than half. At the end of the war, with the advancing Allies, the unit moved to T√ºrkheim in Bavaria when it was subsequently dissolved. =Organisation= Allied traffic intercepts increased significantly when the RAF expanded from 1942 onwards, and the arrival of American Air Forces in the British Isles.IF-180, p. 28 This resulted in a reorganisation of Referat B, which was gradually implemented during 1942. Later the desks of the Referat were organised to correspond to Allied air unit categories, rather than types of radio traffic. The organisation was as follows: * Technical evaluation section which evaluated RAF Coastal Command intercept and during the Normandy landings and with air support, evaluated intercepted party traffic. * Bomber evaluation section, divided into Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces desks, which were concerned with the strategic evaluation of this traffic. * Captured documents, captured signal equipment and navigational aids, evaluation sections. * Tactical air force radio traffic evaluation desk. The Referat has its own mimeograph and technical drawing section. The teleprinter and telephone section was operated exclusively by women. Evaluation Referat B was the senior evaluation agency in the west, and evaluated all the work of the signal intelligence units employed in the west and the north.IF-180, p. 29 This consisted of: * Luftnachrichten-Funkhorch-Regiment West that later became LN Abteilung-Regiment 351 * LN Abteilung-Battalion 357 * LN Abteilung- Battalion 355 The Referat worked with reports forwarded to it from intercept and evaluation companies, and also with the original log sheets and messages. The latter method was used for Radio telegraphy, as the spoken word was always open to interpretation. The material available to the Referat consisted of the following: * Daily reports from evaluation and some intercept companies, that were sent by teleprinter and in some most cases by radio or courier. * Technical and evaluation reports which the intercept companies prepared monthly. * Wireless and Radio telegraphy log sheets. * Prisoner of war interrogations' reports, reports on captured documents and kit. Reports on BBC broadcasts and other collateral intelligence material. This interpolation of this material was strictly forbidden, and when used, a reference was provided to the source and if this was missing a reprimand from Ic operations to the Referat chief resulted. It was provided to bring a richer background to intelligence reports. It was advantageous that personnel of Referat B belonged to Chi-Stelle as intelligence could be reported or when necessary refused to be divulged under certain conditions without reference to rank or station. The last two chiefs of the Referat were adroit at using their position to maintain a close check on the evaluation work in the west.IF-180, p. 30 Duplication of work between Referat B and Luftnachrichten-Funkhorch-Regiment West was an ongoing bureaucratic problem and the only considered solution was the merging of the two units, but it was only realised as the result of Allied pressure, when both Referat B and Luftnachrichten-Funkhorch-Regiment West, following a breakthrough by the Allied at Avranches as part of Operation Cobra by the United States 1st Army, retreated from France. Owing to the difficult housing situation within Germany, the Referat and the evaluation company were established in the same house in Limburg. For each case arising, a discussion took place as to whether a special report or appreciation would be written by the Referat or the specific company from Luftnachrichten-Funkhorch-Regiment West. = Direction of Intercept operations = Outside of final evaluation, the direction of intercept cover in the west and north was the most important task for the Referat. All intercept stations understandably had the desire to monitor only that traffic which yielded results. The Referat had to insure that not only was this traffic covered but also those frequencies necessary to obtain a correct intelligence estimate. For example, several intercept companies could only be moved under pressure to monitor point-to-point networks of the RAF and the Allied Expeditionary Air Force, as no tactical messages that could be reported to combat units were intercepted on those networks. However, these networks still had to be monitored, as it was necessary to understand the organisation of Allied air forces.IF-180, p. 31 With the appearance of new allied units which needed to be monitored, intercept companies found it difficult to burden themselves with the intercept requirements of the new allied units. In that instance, Referat B would intervene, and reorganise the intercept and evaluation companies accordingly, as per need and personnel available. In many cases Referat B itself would take over the analysis of new traffic, and only then would they subsequently assign it to the appropriate evaluation company. =Messages and reports= The most important headquarters to which the Referat reported were: * The Luftwaffe General Staff, Oberkommando der Luftwaffe. * The Chief Signal Officer of the Luftwaffe. * The General der Nachrichtenaufkl√§rung, the signals intelligence agency of the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht. * The B-Dienst, the German Naval Intelligence Service of the Oberkommando der Marine. * Luftflotte 5 * Referat C, for those units working in the south. In many cases reports were also sent to the commander west, Luftflotte 3 and NAAS 5 of Army signals intelligence regiment KONA 5. The following types of messages and reports were involved: * Flash reports of important new discoveries, movements of Allied units, that were sent by telephone and teleprinter. * A 24-hour daily summary report.IF-180, p. 32 * Monthly reports comprising 50‚Äì60 typewritten pages of exhaustive treatment of all events and developments during the month, complete with maps and illustrative diagrams. * Special reports, e.g. on Army-Air Force collaboration during manoeuvres in the Great Britain. Moreover, all important information found in captured material was communicated to individual signals intelligence units. The latter received from Referat B all necessary data such as lists of X and Q groups, lists of frequencies, call signs, abbreviations and so on. Referat B5 In 1941, a section within Referat B was established to monitor and intercept traffic from the United States. This, in turn, was divided into two desks. One desk analysed traffic which was related to United States Army Air Forces, the other to United States Navy air forces, which at the time were being hastily built up. Traffic from America was ready from intercept stations in Germany, France and Norway. The desk reached its peak in late 1942, early 1943, when new equipment was becoming scarce and this dictated a more conservative use of radio receivers. The second section desk intercepted air ferry traffic on the North Atlantic route, in connection to RAF Coastal Command. The Atlantic traffic was monitored by Referat C until 1942 when it reached peak importance. As the war progressed, and United States cryptography steadily improved to an extent it could no longer be read, Referat B took responsibility of this South Atlantic commitment from Referat C. As Allied air ferry traffic increased in importance it was decided to detach the desk from Referat B in mid-1943, and move it into its own section. Specialist personnel from Referat C were moved to Oberhaching and the new section was renamed Referat B5. At the same time a large wireless telegraphy intercept platoon that belonged to the Marstall battalion, was moved to Oberhaching and attached to Referat B5 to take over monitoring of air ferry traffic except those on North Atlantic route, which were covered by the 16th Company of Lichtenstein Regiment (LNR) 3 in Angers.IF-180, p. 33 The new Referat evaluated all air ferry traffic, e.g. Morse code, Baudot code, and had the following responsibilities: * The monitoring of the United States, which only touched the surface of the traffic, still furnished insight into the principal networks of the Army and Naval Air Forces, into training activity, air transport, defence zones, and the activation of new combat aviation units. * The monitoring of Atlantic air ferry service. The middle and central Atlantic routes were monitored by the W/T platoon in Oberhaching and by Luftwaffe signals outstations in Spain, which operated under the cover-name of Purchasing Agencies (Fig 3). The North Atlantic route was monitored by the 16th Company of LNR 3 and reported furnished to the Referat. * The monitoring of the United States Air Transport Command by the platoon in Oberhaching. * The monitoring of the RAF Transport Command and both USAAF and RAF troop carrier command. The greater part of this interception was also carried out in Oberhaching. Airfield radio traffic, transmitted on 6440 Hz was intercepted in Madrid, Montpellier and at various outstations in the Balkans and Italy. This traffic was evaluated by Referat B5 with the aid of an extensive intelligence library encompassing charts, diagrams, directories, manuals, maps, phone directories and so on.IF-180, p. 33 Referat B5 also had a small cryptanalysis section of its own, which deciphered intercepted messages on the spot. Referat B5 remained operational until the last weeks of the war and was in a position to cover the British airborne landing at Bocholt. One week before the capture of Munich by the US 20th Armored Division. US 3rd Infantry Division, US 42nd Infantry Division and US 45th Infantry Divisions, the male members of Referat B5 withdrew to the Alps, while its women auxiliaries were discharged. Referat CGeneral= When the importance of the Mediterranean Theatre increased in the middle of 1942, the totally incapable director of this Referat was relieved from office at the instigations of General Staff operations, and replaced by the director of Referat B. At the same time, several experienced evaluations were transferred to Referat C in order to mentor and assist new staff and this served to increase morale in the unit. In general, the operational methodology of the unit was similar to units in the west. In spite of wire communication to Sicily and Greece being considered reliable, the great distances to the Mediterranean theatre presented problems. The tactical evaluation was lacking and daily reports were always two days behind schedule. Referat C was considered unproductive, inefficient and bureaucratic. During the entire period of its existence it failed to produce a single technical or special report, in spite of the fact there was sufficient material from activity in the Mediterranean area. In early 1943, the number of personnel in the agency was increased with 20 women auxiliaries, with the emphasis shifted entirely to paperwork.IF-180 p. 35 During this period the agency was completed detached from problems in the Mediterranean area. This condition became worse in 1944‚Äì1945 as duty hours were increased, rations became fewer and bombing raids became more frequent. The prevalence of political sycophants, the threat of being sent to the Eastern Front, the threat of transfer via disciplinary action, all served to suppress and curb the agency personnel working 12 hours or more a day. Messages and reports from the retreating signals units in the south became scarcer and scarcer. After the formation of Luftnachrichten Abteilung 352 in spring 1943, a merger of the Referat and the regimental evaluation company was considered, but never carried out. In February 1945, the unit disbanded, with parts of the unit travelling to Premst√§tten in Styria and later in Attersee. Although reduced in size, it started to work again under command of a new energetic director. However, this was short lived and in May it ceased activity. =Organisation= Referat C was organised into desks which corresponded to Allied units or activities, e.g. Mediterranean Allied Tactical Air Force (MATAF), 205 Group RAF, long-range reconnaissance, radar reporting networks, transport and ferry service, airfield radio tower traffic.IF-180 p. 36 In addition, two other sections, one devoted to press reports and prisoner of war intelligence, and other to point-to-point networks were especially successful. The two sections, in close co-operation, maintained a detailed organisational plan of Mediterranean Allied Air Forces (MAAF), that the Luftwaffe operations office included in its monthly reports. The following desks were attached to Referat C: * Turkey. Three men revised and edited the material intercepted and evaluated by W-Leit South-east, and prepared weekly and quarter-yearly for operations. * Sweden and Free France. Monitored by outstations with monthly reports were forwarded to operations. After the German withdrawal from France, the desk was reintegrated to Referat B. * Referat C2. This section was created in 1942 and was engaged in preparing a textbook on the radio, navigational procedures and call signs of the Royal Air Force, United States Army Air Forces and Russian Air Forces. This textbook has a wide distribution, and all larger signals units were given copies for research. Supplements were produced which kept the work up to date. In mid-1944, the work was abandoned and the personnel transferred to signals outstations. An intercept station also existed in the Marstall itself and was manned by linguists from Referat C and E. Its primary function was to monitor and intercept traffic that indicated a bomber raid in the greater Berlin area by the USAAF. As the Marstall was responsible for the allocation of VHF receivers, the equipment in the intercept station was the best of its type.IF-180 p. 37 The proximity of the Referat proved advantageous, as the R/T technicians manned their sets only during a bombing raid and therefore could devote the balance of their time to either evaluation or cryptanalysis. Flash reports were telephoned to Meldek√∂pfe 3 stationed in Wannsee, while final evaluation reports were sent to the ZAF. =Operations= Each morning the teleprinted material arrived during the previous night from the two signal battalions in Italy and the Balkans, from the company in Montpellier, outstations in Spain, and later from the ZAF, as well as from those outstations which were authorised to have direct communication with the Referat. The intercepted material was sorted, categorised by the Referat director and distributed to the appropriate desks. In the course of the afternoon, the desk would check the incoming intercept. If it could be read, it was solved and evaluated immediately. If it could not be, it was sent to cryptanalysis. Deciphered reports were prepared for inclusion in the daily report of the Referat. After being edited by the evaluation officer, the intercept formed the basis for the daily situation conference at which all controversial points were discussed. It was then Mimeographed and around noon it would be ready for distribution. One copy was sent by courier to the General Staff, the others were mailed to the recipients. The afternoon, as a rule, was devoted to the study of incoming reports and a review of log sheets in from the units in the field; maps were prepared and preliminary work was done on the monthly report, the distribution of which corresponded in principle to that of Referat B reports. Correspondence with the regiments and battalions was taken care of, comments from the General Staff were studied and those relevant were passed on to the field units concerned. The Referat achieved success in the field of traffic analysis. By means of network diagrams, the organisation of the Allied tactical air forces in Italy was worked out at a time when W-Leit 2, in spite of its greater proximity to the situation and its operational experience with abundant wireless telegraphy (W/T) and R/T reports of XII Tactical Air Command and Department of the Air Force (DAF), was completely helpless.IF-180 p. 38 In general, like clumsiness, distrust and dodging of responsibility characterised the leadership of Referat C. In order to keep its surplus of personnel occupied, ridiculous and unnecessary tasks, involving a labyrinth of paperwork were created. As a result, all feeling for conciseness was lost. The majority of members of the Referat, in spite of years of service in the Chi-Stelle, had never seen an out-station. This reluctance to face realities weakened the influence of the Referat. In consequence, its options in organisational matters carried little weight within German High Command, and for the most part, it was limited to special problems of evaluation. =Liaison= The liaison also was limited to the field of evaluation. Owing to the location of the Chi-Stelle and personal acquaintances, especially with Luftwaffe Ic, it was considered excellent. Prior to the daily conference, any new problems and all the material that had come in the previous night, were discussed by telephone between the Referat and the operations office, Ic of the Luftwaffe. The discussions that took place included Allied air transport and the current air ferry situation reported by Referat B5 in Oberhaching. When United States radio stations appeared on airfields in the Poltava area, as US bombers and fighters escort landed in these airfields, following attacks on Germany or Rumania, an evaluator from Referat C was dispatched to Referat D in Warsaw. A large intercept platoon was transferred to Warsaw to monitor this traffic. However, the results were insignificant and after fourth months the W/T platoon was recalled.IF-180 p. 39 In 1944, the Referat places a liaison officer with Dulag Luft, that resulted in many pieces of collateral intelligence being collected, as well as important confirmation of previously gathered intelligence. In the last months of the war, the Referat was merged with the evaluation company of Regiment South.

He played college football at Oregon. College career Wilkins served in the Marine Corps during WWII before receiving a discharge after his vision was impaired when he was hit in the eye with a shell casing during training. He enrolled at the University of Oregon and joined the Webfoots basketball as a forward and baseball team as a pitcher. As a freshman, Wilkins was the leading scorer in the 1945 NCAA tournament with 22 points per game. He became the first Oregon player to score 1,000 career points and finished with 1,186. Wilkins was talked into joining the football team as a senior. In his lone season playing college football he led the Webfoots with 27 receptions (a Pacific Coast Conference record) for 520 yards and five touchdowns and was named first team All-Pacific Coast. Professional career Wilkins was drafted by the New York Giants in the 25th round of the 1948 NFL Draft, but instead signed with the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America Football Conference. After the AAFC folded Wilkins was selected by the Los Angeles Rams in the third round of the 1950 AAFC dispersal draft.

It was one of the Massachusetts regiments organized in response to President Abraham Lincoln's call on May 2, 1861 for volunteer troops to serve a term of three-years. The battery trained at Camp Shouler in Lynnfield, Massachusetts and Camp Massasoit in Readville, Massachusetts. It departed Boston by steamship on December 25, 1861. For their first months of service, the members of the battery performed garrison duty at Capitol Hill in Washington and at Hall's Hill in Alexandria, Virginia. The battery was assigned to the First Division of the V Corps of the Army of the Potomac in preparation for the Peninsular Campaign in March 1862. They departed for Fortress Monroe on March 21. During the Peninsular campaign, the battery was engaged in the Siege of Yorktown and the Seven Days Battles. In particular, it was very heavily engaged during the Battle of Gaines's Mill, losing 4 men killed in action, 22 horses and four out of six guns. For several months, this heavy loss resulted the temporary reassignment of the members of the 5th Massachusetts Battery to the 3rd Massachusetts Battery and the 4th Rhode Island Battery. The 5th Massachusetts Battery returned to Washington in September 1862 and was resupplied with guns in October. It rejoined the Army of the Potomac in time to participate in the Union advance into Northern Virginia in November and the Battle of Fredericksburg. In 1863, the battery took part in the Mud March, the Battle of Chancellorsville and was heavily engaged during the Battle of Gettysburg on July 2 and 3, firing 700 rounds and losing 7 men killed in action and 59 horses. During the latter part of 1863, they took part in the Mine Run Campaign and at the end of the year went into winter camp at Rappahannock Station (now Remington, Virginia). In 1864, they participated in Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant's Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg. In September 1864, the recruits and reenlisted men of the 3rd Massachusetts Battery were consolidated with the 5th Massachusetts Battery. On October 3, those of the 5th Massachusetts Battery who had served out their term and did not reenlist went home. A total of 39 of the original members did reenlist for a second term of three years so that, with the addition of some new recruits, the battery continued to serve. They operated at various points along the Petersburg siege lines but for the most part the battery was stationed at Fort Hays to the south of Petersburg. During the final assault on Petersburg on April 1 and 2, 1865, a detachment operating two guns of the battery took Confederate Battery 27 on the siege lines. This engagement was the last time the battery fired their guns in battle. When the Confederates abandoned Petersburg, the battery was withdrawn to City Point, Virginia and remained there until May 3. On that day the unit began its return to Massachusetts, marching to Washington to turn in their guns and equipment. They reached Boston on June 3 and were mustered out at Camp Meigs on June 12, 1865.

Video of the incident showed Ellis on the ground being struck repeatedly by officers, as a witness shouted \\"Stop. Oh my God, stop hitting him. Just arrest him,\\" and Ellis pleading with them, saying \\"I can't breathe\\". Paramedics attended to him for more than 30 minutes before giving up on trying to resuscitate him. Police have stated that Ellis started the confrontation when he picked up an officer and threw him to the ground, while a witness stated police initiated the confrontation. The officers involved were initially placed on administrative leave, but then were returned to work after the police department ruled there had been no violation of policy. Following the release of witness videos, Tacoma mayor Victoria Woodards requested that all officers involved in Ellis's death be fired and prosecuted. Governor of Washington Jay Inslee said that the state would conduct an independent investigation. Persons involved Manuel Ellis was a 33-year-old musician at his church, and had two children: an 11-year-old son and an 18-month old daughter. Ellis was black. Ellis's family has said that Ellis struggled with addiction and mental health. According to a lawyer for the family, Ellis was walking home after playing drums that evening at his church. He reportedly called his mother, brother and sister separately after leaving the Church. Ellis's mother said that she spoke with him about a half an hour before his arrest and death. Arrest and death Police initially said that Ellis had begun a confrontation by striking a police car, attacking four officers and throwing one officer to the ground. According to police, they had seen Ellis trying to open the doors of cars with people inside them. Two of the officers were white, while one was black and one was Asian, according to the Police Department.\\". A witness, who observed the encounter from a car behind Ellis and the officers, said that Ellis approached their police car and appeared to be engaged in what she thought was a \\"friendly\\" conversation with them. Then, the witness said, the officers threw open their door, knocking Ellis to the ground. The witness began taking video footage, which shows officers punching Ellis while he is on the ground. In one video the witness can be heard calling: \\"Stop. Oh my God, stop hitting him. Just arrest him.\\" A lawyer representing the Ellis family claimed that Ellis was also tased, contradicting earlier police statements saying that he was not, and also claimed that police officers had placed themselves on top of Ellis. A detective for the Pierce County Sheriff's Department said that Ellis called out \\"I can't breathe,\\" and that officers requested the help of paramedics and placed Ellis on his side. Police dispatch audio records Ellis shouting \\"I can't breathe\\", and police requesting medical help minutes later. The Pierce County medical examiner ruled that Ellis's death was a homicide, resulting from \\"hypoxia due to physical restraint.\\" The medical examiner stated it was unlikely he would have died from only the restraint and also noted that \\"methamphetamine intoxication and heart disease were factors\\". A mask had been placed by officers over Ellis's mouth to stop him from spitting or biting. The county medical examiner, Dr. Thomas Clark, said Mr. Ellis had enough methamphetamine in his system to be fatal, but he said paramedics initially found him to have a normal heartbeat.\\" At the same time, he was close to respiratory arrest. \\"  Investigation  The officers involved in Ellis's death were initially placed on administrative leave, but then were returned to work after the police department ruled there had been no violation of policy. After the release of witness videos, Tacoma mayor Victoria Woodards requested that all officers involved in Ellis's death be fired and prosecuted. The officers were again placed on leave. After the Tacoma city council sent a letter requesting an independent review of Ellis's death to Washington governor Jay Inslee, the governor said that the state would conduct an independent investigation. Reactions Boarded up shop window at a George Floyd protest in Burbank, California, June 4, 2020 Members of the Ellis family and officials from the NAACP said they wanted more information on Ellis's death and reform, criticizing \\"flashy words\\" from politicians. The Tacoma Police Union objected to calls for the prosecution of the officers involved, saying that video evidence was inadequate and adding \\"This is not a time to sacrifice dedicated public servants at the altar of public sentiment.\\" In their statement, the union condemned the killing of George Floyd.

Description and history The statue was created by Texas artist Waldine Amanda Tauch and donated to the city of Dallas in 1961 by the wealthy restaurateur Earle Wyatt and his wife. It was subsequently installed at Dallas Love Field and dedicated on April 30, 1961. The statue was modeled after Jay Banks, who was a captain of the Texas Rangers in the 1950s. In October 2010, the statue was moved to the nearby Frontiers of Flight Museum to accommodate an airport modernization project. The statue was reinstalled in the renovated terminal lobby on March 12, 2013. On June 4, 2020, the statue was removed following the publication of the book Cult of Glory: The Bold and Brutal History of the Texas Rangers by Doug Swanson. The book details Banks' participation in efforts to keep schools in Texas racially segregated in defiance of the United States Supreme Court's order of public school integration mandated in the 1954 decision Brown v. Board of Education. Banks was in charge of a Texas Ranger division that was deployed in 1956 to prevent African American students from enrolling in Mansfield High School and Texarkana Junior College, a public community college. This was ordered by then governor Allan Shivers, who was against integration, having appointed in 1955 the Texas Advisory Committee on Segregation in Public Schools whose charge was to \\"[e]xamine three major problems and present recommendations leading to their solution. The problems are: (1) The prevention of forced integration. (2) The achievement of maximum decentralization of school authority. (3) The ways in which the State government may best assist the local school districts in solving their problems.\\" The author of Cult of Glory: The Bold and Brutal History of the Texas Rangers was quoted as saying \\"Let's make that clear. [Banks] was following the governor's orders\\" in a live broadcast interview on National Public Radio. At both schools, a mob of white men gathered to block black students from entering. Banks sympathized with the mobs, later writing, \\"They were just salt-of-the-earth citizens who had been stirred up by agitators. They were concerned because they were convinced that someone was trying to interfere with their way of life.\\" At Texarkana Junior College a crowd of \\"about 300 persons\\" blocked the path of two black students who attempted to enter the school, yelling \\"go home niggers.\\" Some surrounded the male student and kicked him, while others threw gravel. The Texas Rangers did nothing to intervene except threaten to arrest the black students in accordance with the governor's orders. Sergeant Jay Banks was present at the Texarkana College incident and stated \\"Our orders are to maintain order and keep down violence. We are to take no part in the integration dispute and we are not going to escort anyone in or out of the college.\\" The local Citizens' Council rewarded Banks with a chicken dinner. The statue has been stored indefinitely by the city of Dallas. When it was removed, the director of the city's Office of Arts and Culture and a spokesperson for mayor Eric Johnson stated that its fate was under consideration.

An inscription on the front of the base reads: Another on the back of the base reads: History Postcard showing the statue Erected in 1891, the work was the gift of Williams' fellow soldiers and the employees of the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway. Vandals stole Wickham's sword in August 1956. The artwork was surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution's \\"Save Outdoor Sculpture!\\" in 1995. In 2017, Clayton and Will Wickham, two of Wickham's descendants, requested that the city of Richmond remove the statue. In their letter to the city council, the brothers wrote that \\"as a plantation owner, Confederate general and industrialist, General Wickham unapologetically accrued power and wealth through the exploitation of enslaved people\\". Public objections to the sculpture's presence in Monroe Park increased during the 2020 George Floyd protests. In June 2020, protesters toppled the sculpture using ropes.

It grows in bogs and marshes in Europe and parts of North America. Description Bog stitchwort is a rhizomatous perennial plant, with smooth, four-angled stems up to tall. Its leaves are opposite and narrow, up to long, with untoothed margins but a few marginal hairs towards the leaf-base. The flowers are borne in cymes of 1‚Äì5, arising from the axils of the higher leaves. Each flower is around in diameter, with 10 stamens, 3 stigmas, five lanceolate‚Äìtriangular, green- coloured but scarious-margined sepals, and five slightly shorter white petals. The petals are divided into two almost to their base with the two halves angled apart, so that the two halves of each petal lie over parts of adjacent sepals. Ecology Bog stitchwort grows in various types of wetland habitat; in the British Isles, it is especially characteristic of areas poached by cattle. It flowers in spring and early summer. Distribution Bog stitchwort is widespread in central and western Europe, but is rarer in eastern and southern Europe and the northern half of Scandinavia. It is thought to be native to eastern parts of North America, but to be an introduced species in the Pacific Northwest. It has also become naturalised in South America, in Asia, where it has become a weed of rice fields, and on the Kerguelen Islands in the southern Indian Ocean, where it is an aggressive invasive species. Taxonomy Stellaria alsine was first described by Johann Friedrich Carl Grimm in 1767. The species has also been widely referred to under the junior synonym Stellaria uliginosa.

The department store was located at Mariahilfer Strasse 26‚Äì30 / Stiftgasse 3 in the 7th district of Vienna, Neubau. A branch of the Peek & Cloppenburg chain has been in its place since 1998. History August Herzmansky, who originated in Odry in what is now the Czech Republic, opened a general store in 1863 in the 7th district at Kirchengasse 2. The concept was well received by the shopping public due to its upscale product range and fixed prices. By 1892 Herzmansky was the largest drapery/department store in the monarchy. Architect Maximilian Katscher built the new building at Stiftgasse 3 between 1896 and1897. This five-storey building was erected on a deep parcel of land (with a wrought-iron structure). A courtyard was designed in the middle with pillars (with stucco covering) and columns (covered with synthetic marble). At the end of the courtyard was a two-branched three-tier main staircase (also of wrought-iron), which was demolished in 1963. Two more staircases connected the building with another courtyard and a neighboring building. The ground and first floors were supported by the aforementioned limestone pillars, the second and third floors by marble pillars (made from Istrian Smerique marble). The expansion of the business led to Herzmansky having five locations by 1917. Succession After the death of the company's founder, his nephews Johann (1857‚Äì1924) and Eduard Herzmansky (1852‚Äì1911) took over the management of the company, but were unable to continue their uncle's success. During this period, Gerngro√ü department store, which had originally partnered with Herzmansky, established himself with a dominant Art Nouveau building (1904) on Mariahilfer Strasse, which had become the main shopping street of Vienna. In 1906, the nephews left the business. A relative by marriage, Johann Falnbigl (1866-1932), took over the management and became a partner. Major extensions were built in 1908 and 1928 during Falnbigl's management. After Falnbigl's death on February 7, 1932, his son Wilfried took over the management for a short time, but left the partnership in 1933. Max Delfiner was the sole owner of the Herzmansky company from 1933 to 1938. Nazi Period With the Anschluss, the store was ‚ÄúAryanized‚Äù in favor of the Dornbirn-based textile producers Rhomberg and H√§mmerle, and the previous owners had to emigrate. In the period 1938‚Äì1940, the purchase of the property at Mariahilfer Strasse 30, giving increased frontage to a thoroughfare with greater footfall, led to an expansion of the sales area and the number of employees to 700 people. The battle for Vienna in April 1945 caused considerable destruction. On the night of April 12-13, 1945, two Herzmansky stores fell victim to the fires, but operations resumed on May 15, 1945. Post-War On 8 November 1948, the business was returned to its rightful owner, Max Delfiner. The management of the company passed to his son, Henry. Then in 1957 the Delfiner sold the bsiness to the German Hertie Group. In preparation for the centennial celebrations in 1963, larger parts of the building were refurbished, with some parts being demolished. In 1965, the store was sold in turn to a consortium of General Shopping SA, CA-SBC, Turicum AG Inter and Durum Hansa AG. This consortium acquired the neighbouring department store, Gerngro√ü in 1966. Three years later, Gerngro√ü and Herzmansky merged. The premises were modernized, and in 1971 a parking garage for 690 cars was put into operation (7th, Stiftgasse 3). In 1988 there was a fundamental conversion to an \\"adventure department store\\" (six floors with 15,000 square meters of retail space), opening on September 15, 1988. In 1996, the Gerngross Group, and thus Herzmansky, was sold to a consortium made up of the Palmers textile group and Hans Schmid, the operator of the GGK advertising agency. While the Gerngross department store was reopened in February 1997, after a renovation, the Herzmansky department store was closed on July 12, 1997. The Herzmansky site was sold to the D√ºsseldorf fashion chain Peek & Cloppenburg in 1998. On March 4, 1998, the first Weltstadthaus (world city house) concept store by Peek & Cloppenburg opened in the Herzmansky building. As the name was discontinued, the long history of the Herzmansky department store came to an end, for the time being. Memorabilia and the bust of the founder, which previously adorned the foyer of the department store, are now kept in the district museum in the new building. In 2005, Sparkassen Immobilien AG bought the majority stake in Gerngross Kaufhaus AG from the Palmers Group. These include the department stores Steffl and Herzmansky. The original building on the Stiftgasse is preserved in its original condition from the outside, with the inscription \\"A. Herzmansky‚Äù framed in the cornice in golden mosaics clearly recognizable, as well as on the black marble panels on the street front at ground level. Today there is an upscale cafe on the ground floor, which is operated by Cafe Gerstner.  Pictures  Herzmansky Vienna 1906.JPGAn advertisement from 1906 Wien Spezial-Kaufh√§user A.

Its first release in 2019 included benchmarks of its performance in go, chess, shogi, and a standard suite of Atari games. The algorithm uses an approach similar to AlphaZero. It matched AlphaZero's performance in chess and shogi, improved on its performance in Go (setting a new world record), and improved on the state of the art in mastering a suite of 57 Atari games (the Arcade Learning Environment), a visually-complex domain. MuZero was trained via self- play and play against AlphaZero, with no access to rules, opening books, or endgame tables. The trained algorithm used the same convolutional and residual algorithms as AlphaZero, but with 20% fewer computation steps per node in the search tree.  History  On November 19, 2019, the DeepMind team released a preprint introducing MuZero.  Derivation from AlphaZero  MuZero (MZ) is a combination of the high-performance planning of the AlphaZero (AZ) algorithm with approaches to model-free reinforcement learning. The combination allows for more efficient training in classical planning regimes, such as Go, while also handling domains with much more complex inputs at each stage, such as visual video games. MuZero was derived directly from AZ code, and shares its rules for setting search hyperparameters. Differences between the approaches include: * AZ's planning process uses a simulator (which knows the rules of the game, and has to be explicitly programmed by a human) and a neural network (which predicts the policy and value of a future position). Perfect knowledge of game rules is used in modeling state transitions in the search tree, actions available at each node, and termination of a branch of the tree. MZ does not have access to a perfect ruleset, and replaces it with learned neural networks, which are used for the aforementioned modeling. * AZ has a single model for the game (from board state to predictions); MZ has separate models for representation of the current state (from board state into its internal embedding), dynamics of states (how actions change representations of board states), and prediction of policy and value of a future position (given a state's representation). * MZ's hidden model may be complex, and it may turn out it can cache computation in it; exploring the details of a hidden model in a successfully-trained instance of MZ is an avenue for future exploration. * MZ doesn't expect a two-player game where winners take all. It works with standard reinforcement-learning scenarios, including single-agent environments with continuous intermediate rewards, possibly of arbitrary magnitude and with discounting over time. AZ was designed exclusively for two-player games that could be won, drawn, or lost.  Comparison with R2D2  The previous state of the art technique for learning to play the suite of Atari games was R2D2, the Recurrent Replay Distributed DQN. MuZero surpassed both R2D2's mean and median performance across the suite of games, though it did not do better in every game.  Training and results  MuZero used 16 third-generation tensor processing units [TPUs] for training, and on 1000 TPUs for selfplay (for board games, with 800 simulations per step) and 8 TPUs for training and 32 TPUs for selfplay (for Atari games, with 50 simulations per step). AlphaZero used 64 first-generation TPUs for training, and 5000 second-generation TPUs for selfplay. As TPU design has improved (third-generation chips are 2x as powerful individually as second-generation chips, with further advances in bandwidth and networking across chips in a pod), these are fairly comparable training setups. R2D2 was trained for 5 days through 2M training steps.  Preliminary results  MuZero matched AlphaZero's performance in chess and Shogi after roughly 1 million training steps. It matched AZ's performance in Go after 500 thousand training steps, and surpassed it by 1 million steps. It matched R2D2's mean and median performance across the Atari game suite after 500 thousand training steps, and surpassed it by 1 million steps; though it never performed well on 6 games in the suite.  Reactions and related work  MuZero was viewed as a significant advancement over AlphaZero, and a generalizable step forward in unsupervised learning techniques. The work was seen as advancing understanding of how to compose systems from smaller components, a systems-level development more than a pure machine-learning development. While only pseudocode was released by the development team, Werner Duvaud produced an open source implementation based on that. MuZero has been used as a reference implementation in other work, for instance as a way to generate model-based behavior.

The Ni√±os de Rusia (Children of Russia) were the 2,895 children evacuated to the Soviet Union by the Republican authorities during the Spanish civil war. Between 1937-8 the children were sent from the Republican zone to the Soviet Union, to avoid the rigours of war. Spanish children were sent to several other countries as well as Russia during this period and they are more widely referred to as Ni√±os de la Guerra (Children of War).Por ejemplo, en CUADRIELLO, Juan Domingo (2009). El exilio republicano espa√±ol en Cuba. Espa√±a: Siglo XXI de Espa√±a. , p√°g. 45\\\\. At first, the Ni√±os enjoyed a warm welcome and decent treatment from the Soviet authorities, as the Spanish civil war raged on. However, when the Soviet Union entered into World War II and the Nazi's invaded the areas where the Ni√±os children had been housed, they had to endure the harsh reality and deprivations of the war once more. The Ni√±os were not able to leave the USSR during the war, and due to the political differences between the countries, the right wing dictatorship in Spain treated those who finally succeeded in returning with suspicion. The first of the Ni√±os to be repatriated was Celestino Fern√°ndez-Miranda Tu√±√≥n, who arrived in Spain on January 7, 1942. He had fought in the Soviet army and been taken prisoner by the Finns in Karelia. Some of the Ni√±os de Rusia returned to Spain between 1956 and 1959 and others moved to Cuba during the 1960s, although an significant number remained in Russia. According to the archives of the Centro Espa√±ol de Mosc√∫ (Spanish Center in Moscow), 239 Ni√±os de Rusia of Spanish origin were still resident in the territories of the former Soviet Union in February 2004.Colomina Limonero, Immaculada (2005). Breve historia de los ni√±os de la guerra de Espa√±a en Rusia. Biblioteca del Instituto Cervantes de Mosc√∫.  The evacuations  As the Spanish civil war (1936 - 1939) progressed, conditions became very harsh in the Republican controlled areas, so children at risk from the conflict were evacuated to other countries. The evacuations were organised through the National Council for Evacuated Children, created for this purpose by the Popular Front government. France took c. 20,000 children, Belgium 5,000. The United Kingdom took 4,000, Switzerland took 800, Mexico took 455 and Denmark took 100 evacuee children.Alted Vigil, Alicia (2005). ¬´El ‚Äúinstante congelado‚Äù del exilio de los ni√±os de la guerra civil espa√±ola¬ª, revista Deportate, Esuli, Pr√≥fughe, n.¬∫ 3, p√°gs. 263-281. Four transports of evacuees (Ni√±os), totalling 2,895 children were sent to the Soviet Union between 1937 and 1938, 1,197 girls and 1,676 boys.Devillard, Mar√≠a Jos√©; Pazos, √Ålvaro; Castillo, Susana; y Medina, Nuria (2001).

The evacuations were organised through the government of the Spanish Republic, the Soviet Union and the International Red Cross, with the selection of the children and their adult companions made through calls to the public. The evacuations were sometimes undertaken with great urgency because of the proximity of Francoist Nationalist troops. This led to a number of cases of confusion and loss of children (lost on the journey from one province to another, or where parents who thought that their children were going to France and not to the Soviet Union). { style=\\"width:650px; height:50px\\" cellpadding=\\"5\\" border=\\"1\\" align=\\"center\\" +Spanish children evacuated to the USSR between 1937 and 1939 * Sources: Russian Red Cross / Fundaci√≥n Francisco Largo Caballero Number of children Departure date Origin Port of departure - style=\\"background:MintCream\\" 72 March de 1937 / 21/03/37 Madrid and Valencia Valencia - style=\\"background:MintCream\\" 1765 / 1495 12/06/37 / 13/06/37 Pa√≠s Vasco (Basque Country) Bilbao (Santurce). - style=\\"background:MintCream\\" 800 / 1100 23/09/37 / 24/09/37 Asturias Gij√≥n (El Musel). - style=\\"background:MintCream\\" 76 / approx. 300 October 1938 / end of 1938 Barcelona Barcelona - style=\\"background:MintCream\\" 130 1939 n/a n/a - style=\\"background:MintCream\\" 52 Post war n/a n/a } * The data in black is confirmed by both sources, otherwise they differ or only appear in the source in which they are coloured.

Fundaci√≥n Francisco Largo Caballero. Several of the transfers were made on merchant ships, in which the children travelled crowded in the holds. According to the agreement with the Soviet Union, the children were to be between five and twelve years old, although there is evidence of cases of concealment or falsification of some of the Ni√±os children's real ages, with some sources indicating that the actual ages ranged from 3 to 14 years.Colomina Molinero, Inmaculada.

A small group of adults (aged between 19 and 50) accompanied them to take care of them and to continue their education.  Las Casas de Ni√±os (The Children's Houses)  The reception given to some of the evacuees in Leningrad was akin to a party. The Ni√±os children were seen as demonstrating Soviet support for the fight against fascism in Spain. The Soviet authorities were concerned with children's hygiene, food and health. They were distributed to different reception centers, the \\"Casas de Ni√±os\\" (Children's Houses) or \\"Casas Infantiles para Ni√±os Espa√±oles\\" (Children's Houses for Spanish Children), some of which were small palaces that had been expropriated during the October Revolution. In these houses, the Ni√±os were cared for and educated, taught mostly in Spanish, and by Spanish teachers (mostly women), but following the Soviet educational model. Communist propaganda portrayed them as the future political elite in a Spanish socialist republic which would emerge from victory in the Civil War. The children and their families believed that their time in Russia would be short, and in their later testimonies they confirm that they were happy with the adventure of travelling to a foreign country. At the end of 1938 there were a total of sixteen Ni√±os houses in the Soviet Union. Eleven of them were located in the current Russian Federation: one in the center of Moscow (known as Pirog√≥vskaya),Castillo Rodr√≠guez, Susana. Memoria, Educaci√≥n e Historia: el caso de los ni√±os espa√±oles evacuados a la Uni√≥n Sovi√©tica durante la Guerra Civil Espa√±ola. Tesis doctoral. Madrid, 1999.

Life in the Children's Houses is generally remembered by the surviving Ni√±os as a happy interlude during which they received a decent education.  Second World War  The Ni√±os's fate changed with the start of the Second World War. Soviet interest in the Ni√±os decreased after the end of the Spanish Civil War, and with the signing of the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact in August 1939, which assured non aggression between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. Soon after Germany, and then the Soviet Union invaded Poland, creating a new boundary between the two powers. The pact was fully terminated in June 1941. The Ni√±os houses were dismantled due to the dangers of Nazi invasion. When the German army besieged Leningrad, and moved towards Moscow, and into Ukraine in the south, all the areas where the Spanish children had been placed were compromised. The Ni√±os children in the two houses of Leningrad endured the blockade of the city by the German army during the harsh winter of 1941 to 1942.Exposici√≥n: El exilio espa√±ol de la Guerra Civil: Los ni√±os de la guerra. Fundaci√≥n Francisco Largo Caballero. 300 Ni√±os children were evacuated once the fence could be opened, crossing the frozen lake Ladoga in trucks.Testimonio de dos 'ni√±as de Rusia' en Jaca El sue√±o igualitario.

Cuadernos de Cazarabet, p√°g 21 (Fuente: Diario del Altoarag√≥n). Gradually, and with the agreement of the Communist Party of Spain, the different Ni√±os houses were evacuated to areas considered safer, in some cases quite remote, near the Ural Mountains and Central Asia. Living conditions in the \\"second exile\\" worsened markedly. Many children died or fell ill. Tuberculosis and typhus, together with the extreme temperatures of the Soviet winter and a poor diet, claimed numerous victims. Many of the older boys enlisted in the Red Army. Many chose to fight against fascism in Russia just as their parents did in Spain, and to repay the people who had received them and cared for them until the arrival of war. However, there were also cases of retaliation by the Soviet Union itself when there were challenges to communism. Dr. Juan Bote Garc√≠a, who had accompanied the children as a teacher, was arrested and was interned in the Karagand√° concentration camp for refusing to educate the children in a Soviet way, wanting \\"less Marxism and more mathematics\\".The tragedy or Karaganda De libcom.org (en ingl√©s). Nazi incursion on the Eastern Front. A group of Spanish children was captured in the town of Krasnoarmeysk in the Saratov Oblast. 130 Ni√±os enlisted in the Red Army and served in the defense of the main cities of the country, especially in the battles for the defense of Moscow, Leningrad and Stalingrad, some were decorated for their military service. Seventy Spaniards died in the Siege of Leningrad, 46 were children or teenagers. The rest of the Ni√±os were no luckier. The transfers across the Soviet Union took them to remote places such as Samarkand or Kokand (present- day Uzbekistan), Tbilisi (present-day Georgia), or Krasnoarmeysk (in present- day Saratov Oblast, Russia). In August 1942 the Nazi army captured sixteen (or fourteen, according to some sources) Spanish children in Krasnoarmeysk. They were handed over to the Falange for repatriation to Francoist Spain in December, where they were used for propaganda purposes. Dolores Ib√°rruri, Known as \\"La Pasionaria\\" (Passionflower) originator of the famous slogan ¬°No Pasar√°n! and a leader in the PCE in Russia (1895-1989). The most shocking testimonies come from this period: hunger, disease, crime, rape and prostitution.Vidal, C√©sar. Los juguetes rotos de Stalin [1] y [2]. Art√≠culo en la \\"Revista del Domingo\\" del Diario La Vanguardia. 14/06/98: Various sources refer to the existence of Ni√±os gangs dedicated to stealing. The Republican military commander Valent√≠n Gonz√°lez El Campesino refers to the existence of a gang of Spanish children in Kokand, who refused to mix with Russian children, and who used the flag of the Spanish Republic as an emblem. Gonz√°lez said that when one of those children was captured and executed, it was not in his role as a bandit, but as a supposed \\"Falangist\\".Gonz√°lez Gonz√°lez, Valent√≠n.

The children's settlements where the Ni√±os had been transferred to began to suffer the rigours of war. Although the Ni√±os were still, at least nominally, under the protection of the Communist Party of Spain (PCE), the Red Cross and other Soviet institutions and unions, the then leader of the PCE Jes√∫s Hern√°ndez, himself exiled in the Soviet Union, often had to pressure the authorities to provide the most basic items for the Ni√±os's survival: food, medicine, heating.Hern√°ndez S√°nchez, Fernando (1950). Pistolero, ministro, esp√≠a y renegado, citando desde Vanni, E: Yo, comunista en Rusia. Barcelona: Destino, p√°gs. 206-207. Those who did survive managed to do so by enduring harsh living conditions, living in peasant houses and working the fields to secure a livelihood. When Hern√°ndez left the Soviet Union in 1943 on his way to Mexico, nearly 40% of the Ni√±os had died. In 1947, on the anniversary of their arrival in Russia, an event was organised where fewer than 2000 of the children were present.Hern√°ndez Tom√°s, Jes√∫s (1974). En el pa√≠s de la gran mentira. Madrid: G. del Toro. There was significant criticism of the PCE, for not returning the children to Spain. Hern√°ndez claimed that Dolores Ib√°rruri stated that: \\"No podemos devolverlos a sus padres convertidos en golfos y prostitutas, ni permitir que salgan de aqu√≠ como furibundos antisovi√©ticos.\\" (We cannot return them to their parents turned gullies and prostitutes, nor allow them to leave here as angry anti- Soviets.) The memories the Ni√±os had of the behavior of the PCE, and particularly that of Ib√°rruri, was often negative. The deprivation suffered by the Ni√±os was reflected by the similar experiences of the wider Soviet population during the Second World War.  Attempts to retrieve the Ni√±os children by the Spanish state  The return of the Ni√±os evacuees, especially those in the Soviet Union, was something which the Franco regime in Spain continued to pursue. Even before the end of the Second World War, the Falange took control of the repatriation project. Manuel Hedilla, head of the organisation, sent a letter to The Times in 1937 asking for help in reversing what he described as \\"inhumane export of children\\" to the Soviet Union,Blanco Moral, Francisco A. ¬´Los \\"ni√±os de la guerra\\": expatriaci√≥n y repatriaci√≥n¬ª, revista El Rastro de la Historia, n.¬∫ 2. offering to defray the costs of maintaining the children. The Servicio Exterior de Falange (the Falange Foreign Service) was placed in charge of the project. The records are held in the Alcal√° de Henares archives, including a 1949 document describing some of the methods used.Art√≠culo, en El Comercio Digital, 7 de octubre de 2007. \\"Nuestros delegados en el extranjero solicitan su devoluci√≥n a Espa√±a; en un 99 por ciento de los casos esa solicitud es denegada. Se recurre entonces sin miramientos a los medios extraordinarios, con los que, de una forma u otra, casi siempre se logra al fin obtener al menor.\\" (Our delegates abroad request their return to Spain; but in 99 percent of cases that request is denied. Extraordinary means are then used without regard, with which, in one way or another, it is almost always possible to finally obtain the minor.) The first returnee under this policy was one of the Ni√±os who become a soldier in the Red Army, and was taken prisoner during the Winter War between the Soviet Union and Finland in 1939-40. Information obtained from him convinced the Falange that the Ni√±os were being trained as communist activists. This was enhanced by the Nazi capture of a group of Ni√±os in 1942, allegedly members of an \\"activist cell\\". The regime was always suspicious that the repatriated Ni√±os could be communist agents. In 1952, the Falangist writer and poet Federico de Urrutia railled against \\"the minor expatriates of 1937\\" sent to the Soviet Union, who he claimed \\"dada la infrahumana educaci√≥n recibida [...] ya habr√≠an dejado de ser criaturas humanas, para convertirse en desalmados entes sovietizados.\\"Blanco Moral, Francisco A. ¬´Los \\"ni√±os de la guerra\\": expatriaci√≥n y repatriaci√≥n¬ª, revista El Rastro de la Historia, n.¬∫ 2. (Given the subhuman education they received, [...] they would have ceased to be human creatures, to become soulless Soviet entities.) Under this policy, once the child was repatriated, they were not returned to their family, \\"por no ofrecer [...] ninguna garant√≠a sobre su educaci√≥n\\" (for not being able to offer [...] any guarantee on their education), but were handed over to the Auxilio Social (a Francoist era humanitarian relief organisation much used for state propaganda).  After the war: Spain, Mexico, Cuba, the Soviet Union  After the end of the Second World War, most of the surviving Ni√±os returned to the original area they has been settled in within the Soviet Union. Many ended up settling in Moscow, although some did settle elsewhere.Informe de la Direcci√≥n General de Inmigraci√≥n de 11/05/06. Ministerio de Trabajo e Inmigraci√≥n, Gobierno de Espa√±a. Eventually, holidays in Spain were permitted for those who had spent twenty years in the Soviet Union.Castillo Rodr√≠guez, Susana.

In 1946, a small group of about 150 of the original Ni√±os had obtained permission to go to Mexico to be reunited with their relatives.Alted Vigil, Alicia (2005). ¬´El ‚Äúinstante congelado‚Äù del exilio de los ni√±os de la guerra civil espa√±ola¬ª, revista Deportate, Esuli, Pr√≥fughe, n.¬∫ 3, p√°gs. 263-281. After Stalin's death in 1953, a period of slow diplomatic thaw began between Spain and the Soviet Union. Spain joined the UN in 1955 and in 1957 an agreement was reached for the return of the Ni√±os who wished to go back to Spain. The transfer was organised quietly, although the Spanish government was keen to paint the exercise as rescuing the former child evacuees from the dangers of the Soviets. On January 21, as part of an agreement between both countries and with the assistance of the Red Cross, the Soviet ship Crimea arrived at the port of Castell√≥n de la Plana with 412 Spaniards on board.Diversos calendarios de efem√©rides: p. ej. Eldia.es o Hispan√≥polis.com. Between that year and the next, nearly half of the Ni√±os sent to the Soviet Union would arrive in Spain.Exposici√≥n: El exilio espa√±ol de la Guerra Civil: Los ni√±os de la guerra. Fundaci√≥n Francisco Largo Caballero. The Ni√±os encountered hostility on their return. Some authorities mistrusted them, suspecting that they now held communist beliefs. For many families the reunion was difficult. They had sent children away for their safety, but were now being reunited with adults after almost twenty years, some now parents themselves, and with very different life experiences. A significant number of the Ni√±os ultimately decided to return to the Soviet Union. Knowledge of the Spanish language led another group of about 200 Ni√±os to move to Castro's Cuba from 1961 to the mid-1970s, as Soviet specialists sent by the Communist Party of Spain. They worked as translators, teachers, in construction or even for Cuban intelligence.Informe de la Direcci√≥n General de Inmigraci√≥n de 11/05/06.

Since the 1960s, some individuals have chosen to return to Spain, and after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a considerable number returned. Those who stayed permanently in the Soviet Union, specifically in Moscow, used to meet in the halls of a factory, in the Chk√°lov Club or in the Spanish Center itself (also known as the House of Spain).Castillo Rodr√≠guez, Susana.

Diplomatic relations were not revived between Spain and the Soviet Union until the last months of the Francoist dictatorship in 1977. With the crumbling of the Soviet regime in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Ni√±os remained in legal limbo until 1990, when the Spanish courts made it possible for them to recover their \\"lost\\" nationality.Ley 18/1990, de 17 de diciembre (BOE 18 de diciembre), sobre reforma del C√≥digo Civil en materia de nacionalidad. In 1994, the Ni√±os were granted the right to receive retirement, disability and survival pensions from Spain and in 2005, the rights to economic benefits was recognised for Ni√±os still living abroad and for returnees who had spent most of their lives outside of Spain. por Ley 3/2005, de 18 de marzo (BOE 21 de marzo) , cumpliendo lo establecido en la disposici√≥n adicional quincuag√©sima quinta de la Ley 2/2004, de 27 de diciembre (BOE 28 de diciembre), de Presupuestos Generales del Estado para 2005.

After attending the University of Oxford, where he played first-class cricket, Webb became a paediatrician who spent eighteen years at the Christian Medical College in Vellore, Tamil Nadu and was instrumental in helping set up a paediatric medical structure in the country. Early life and education The son of Arthur Herbert Guy Webb and Elsie Webb (n√©e Greengrass), he was born at Chingford in October 1918. From 1932 to 1937 he was educated at Highgate School, where he was captain of the football, cricket and Eton Fives teams as well as head boy. He then went up to Balliol College, Oxford. While studying at Oxford, he made a single appearance in first-class cricket for Oxford University against the Free Foresters at Oxford in 1938. Batting twice in the match, he was dismissed without scoring by Jack Meyer in the Oxford first innings, while in their second innings he was dismissed by the same bowler for five runs. Although he did not receive a blue in cricket, he did gain a blue playing football for Oxford University A.F.C.. He additionally captained the university at Eton Fives. Partnering Howard Fabian he won the Kinnaird Cup three times, in 1937, 1939 and 1948. Medical career and later life Having undertaken his medical training at the Radcliffe Infirmary, Webb enlisted in the British Army during the Second World War, being enlisted as a second lieutenant in the Royal Army Medical Corps in October 1942. Following the war, he served as a graded physician in the British Army of the Rhine from 1945‚Äì47. He was demobilised in 1948, returning to Oxford where he was children's registrar at Churchill Hospital until 1950, before moving to Newcastle to train in paediatrics under James Calvert Spence at the Royal Victoria Infirmary. A committed Christian, he was inspired to work at the Christian Medical College (CMCH), in Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India by a speech from Frank Lake. He was appointed professor of paediatrics at CMCH in 1953. As the only paediatrician in Vellore, Webb spent the next few years training and inspiring the next generation of paediatricians. In 1961, he recorded the pattern of liver disease in children of Vellore. As head of the paediatric department, his research was instrumental in discovering Japanese encephalitis to be the cause of encephalitis epidemic in Tamil Nadu and filariasis as the cause of tropical eosinophilia. In 1958-59 he was president of the Indian Pediatric Society which was merged into the Indian Academy of Pediatrics in 1963. Webb's wider focus in child health saw him establish community field virus laboratories and engage teams to study issues among children around Vellore, such as malnutrition. He was honoured in the 1971 Birthday Honours with an OBE. Webb returned to England after eighteen years at CMCH, the last few years of which he served as its director. He returned to Newcastle where he became the James Spence professor of child health, mentoring and encouraging community engagement by his students under his guidance. Among his achievements was to initiate a major project that outlined the standards for the care of children in general practice. A friend of his later recalled that Webb had lobbied for beds for mothers in the children's wards in England, after observing that the practice had allayed fears and isolation for children in India. Following his retirement, Webb became director of the Child to Child programme which sought to encourage children in developing countries to share health issues with friends of family. In retirement he was engaged by Great Ormond Street Hospital, where he specialised in tropical paediatrics. Personal life Webb died on 17 August 2010, in Gloucestershire.‚ÄúDr John Webb passes away‚Äù. CMC Newsline, Vol. 48, No. 09 (30 August 2010) He was married to Alison Dora (n√©e Reid), a medical graduate from St Hilda's College, Oxford in 1949, with his wife moving to India with him. The couple had five children, all of whom were educated in England. Four of their children followed their parents by becoming medical doctors, which included their son Jonathan, who also played rugby union for and captained the England national rugby union team.

It occupies approximately 10.91 square miles or 6,980 acres falling largely within the Town of Rye. It spans the borders of New York and Connecticut. Geography It is estimated that 96.7 percent of the Blind Brook watershed is in Westchester, New York and the remaining 3.3 percent is in Fairfield County, Connecticut. The headwaters of the Blind Brook estuary begin in West Harrison, New York. The watershed terminates at the City of Rye, draining into Milton Harbor. Flooding The area has historically been known for acute flooding. This phenomenon affects Harrison, Rye, Rye Town and Port Chester. In 1968, environmentalist Edith Gwynne Read called attention to the need for impacted communities to collaborate on proactive solutions to study the already saturated watershed. While naturally occurring but heavy rainfalls trigger flooding, increased construction and creation of impervious surfaces during the 20th century are among the human impacts contributing to this phenomenon. In 1980, Rye residents and politicians called out the deleterious effects of the creation of massive office parks; corporate campuses that were blamed for increasing flooding downstream included SUNY Purchase, General Foods and Texaco. Following the Nor'easter of 2007, another study was prepared in 2008 by the US Army Corps of Engineers. That study claimed that the most catastrophic flooding in Rye had occurred in 1972 following Hurricane Agnes. Westchester County Airport impacts Westchester County Airport was constructed in 1942, by the Air National Guard with a goal of protecting the Rye Lake Reservoir from war time sabotage and safeguarding New York's drinking water supply. However the runoff ultimately was diverted to the Blind Brook watershed. In 2011, plans to expand Westchester County Airport produced more scrutiny of the potentially adverse environmental impacts of development. An RFQ was issued with the stated goals of obtaining a \\"wetland delineation survey of the entire airport property\\" as well as re-validation of \\"previously mapped wetland boundaries\\" and areas of change. Archaeology Portions of the watershed are of great archaeological significance. The presence of Native Americans has been established many times through the discovery of relics and burial sites in the Blind Brook area in 1855 and 1867. In 1972, a construction vehicle preparing the site for building a new house unearthed skeletal remains. Archaeologists were brought in to further examine the burial site. Over 50 pottery sherds were found and assessed to be from the Clason's Point phase. The area is just a mile from another archaeologically significant site, Marshlands Conservancy. Wildlife The Blind Brook watershed has been recognized as an important area for flora and fauna. Portions that had eroded have been restored by Westchester County's Planning Department improving water quality and enhancing habitat for wildlife. Controversy Allegations that the waterway has been polluted by the City of Rye were made in 2015, by the non-profit organization Save the Sound. The group claims the municipality violated the EPA Clean Water Act. Expansion of the airport has raised concerns over adverse environmental impacts on the Blind Brook watershed and water quality. A community advocacy group called the Citizens for a Responsible County Airport count the Sierra Club Lower Hudson and Federated Conservationists of Westchester as supporters; they have raised safety concerns about the stormwater runoff. They are especially alarmed about PFASs discovered in groundwater tests between the Airport and the Kensico watershed. Cyber attack Remote access to the Bowman Dam which helps control flooding of the Blind Brook watershed was compromised in 2013 by an Iranian hacker.

They had been preceded by a number of low-definition BBC test broadcasts, as well as a 180-line Deutscher Fernseh Rundfunk service, from Berlin, since March 1935.  Background  The British Broadcasting Corporation, already an established radio broadcaster, began making low definition (30-line) test television transmissions under government licence in August 1936. These included short ad-hoc performances by musicians, with the duration limited as \\"lookers in\\" (as viewers were called) were found to experience eye strain through looking at the small screens then in use. The first regular electronic television service in Germany began in Berlin on 22 March 1935, as Deutscher Fernseh Rundfunk. Broadcasting from the Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow, it used a 180-line system, and was on air for 90 minutes, three times a week.  Line-up  Blue plaque at Alexandra Palace The BBC Television Service officially launched on 2 November 1936.

The films included Television Comes to London, a pre-made fifteen-minute documentary about the launch, shot on 35mm film. It was the BBC's first television documentary.  Opening  The first person heard and seen was the announcer, Leslie Mitchell. According to advance publicity in The Radio Times, the opening was then to be:  Variety  The Radio Times billed the Variety performers as: * Adele Dixon ‚Äì Musical Comedy Star * Buck and Bubbles ‚Äì Comedians and Dancers * The Lai Founs ‚Äì Chinese Jugglers however, in the event The Lai Founs did not appear. Dixon performed a specially commissioned song, \\"Television\\", written by James Dyrenforth and Kenneth Leslie-Smith. The event made Buck and Bubbles (Buck Washington and John W. Bubbles) the first black people to appear on television. The musicians were billed as The BBC Television Orchestra, led by Boris Pecker and conducted by Hyam Greenbaum. The producer was listed as Dallas Bower.  Technology  The broadcast was made from a converted wing of Alexandra Palace (\\"Ally Pally\\") in London, using the 240-line Baird intermediate film system, on the VHF band. BBC television initially used two systems on alternate weeks: the Baird system and the 405-line Marconi-EMI system. The decision to use the Baird system for the first week was made on a coin toss. The use of the two formats made the BBC's service the world's first regular high-definition television service; it broadcast from Monday to Saturday between 15:00 and 16:00, and 21:00 and 22:00. Alexandra Palace housed two studios (one for each system), various scenery stores, make-up areas, dressing rooms, offices, and the transmitter itself.

Browning (the flight towards the still unexplored American territories), emancipation through military conscription, the manumission participation, and integration of the slave point of view in the discourse on freedom are constitutive strategies developed gradually and a discreet resistance leading little by little towards the resumption of their freedoms in a process called incapacitation.

The painter and sitter first met in 1983 when Freud phoned Parker Bowles, then the Commanding officer of the Household Cavalry Regiment, to request some horses to be life models for paintings he planned to create.https://artdaily.cc/news/82074/Christie-s-unveils-one-of-Lucian-Freud- s-most-imposing-and-powerful-portraits#.XwCf0x4pA0M Years later Freud decided that it was time to paint Parker-Bowles himself. For the painting the artist and sitter visited, viewed, and discussed James Jacques Tissot's portrait of Frederick Burnaby (1870) which is displayed at the National Portrait Gallery in London, and agreed upon it as a point of departure for the new work. Subsequently Parker Bowles returned to the Knightsbridge barracks to reclaim his old military uniform from when he served as Commanding Officer of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, then as Colonel Commanding the Household Cavalry and Silver Stick in Waiting to Queen Elizabeth II, and then as Brigadier director of the Royal Army Veterinary Corps; and redonned it. Therein the retired military officer found he had become a bit more portly since. Upon hearing this Freud said \\"no matter\\" because the painting would only be head and shoulders, but the end result was full length. Parker-Bowles has himself offered that he had the opportunity to purchase the work, but did not have \\"three or four million to spare\\". Instead it was first acquired by the American investment banker Damon Mezzacappa. The painting was then put up for auction following the wealthy Floridian's death in April 2015.https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/homes-and-property/fine-art- antiques/freud-s-portrait-of-brigadier-set-to-sell-for-30m-1.2401775 Mezzacappa lent the painting to the Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Florida for their 2013 exhibition of the artist's later work, \\"Lucian Freud: Paintings and Prints\\".

The stripping of the soldier is therefore particularly subtle. The uniform‚Äôs brilliant surface accentuates the subject‚Äôs hands and fleshy face. His eyes look inward, as if caught hiding behind his uniform, even as his stomach billows out from his loosened jacket. One hand clasps the chair while the other is raised, as if he were suspended inside a question. The angles of the composition are exquisitely poised without being too tight, and are marvelously suggestive. The long, loose rectangular strip floating upward behind the brigadier‚Äôs upraised hand not only controls the visual space but could almost be a dream of a baton or a riding crop. The luscious red stripe, so evocative of Manet, defines painterly panache\\".https://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/art/reviews/n_10361/ Tom Parker Bowles told the Evening Standard ‚ÄúFreud captures something about my father that is not possible to describe, something closer to his essence, his soul.

Nasookin was one of the largest inland steam vessels ever to operate in British Columbia and the Columbia River and its tributaries. Nasookin became surplus to its original owner, the Canadian Pacific Railway, and was transferred to the British Columbia Provincial government which used it as an auto ferry until 1947. Negligent mooring of the steamer in 1948 led to irreparable damage to its hull, and it was later scrapped. Portions of the upper works were salvaged and used as a house.  Name  The name Nasookin was reported to mean ‚ÄúBig Chief.‚Äù The name was selected by CPR in Montreal on the recommendation of A.D. Wheeler, of Ainsworth, to continue the plan of using First Nations names for all of its steamers on the lake. Design Nasookin in ice, March 1929. Nasookin was the sister ship of two other vessels, Bonnington operating on the Arrow Lakes and Sicamous, on Okanagan Lake. Nasookin was the second to be built, with Bonnington having been the first. Nasookin was nearly identical to Bonnington. Nasookin had a steel deck, whereas that of Bonnington‚Äôs was of wood. The hull design was slightly different on Nasookin and its engines were more powerful.  Main deck  Nasookin had four decks. The main deck housed the boiler and the engines, and had space for cargo. The crew accommodations were also on the main deck. On the left side of the main deck was a galley, a pantry, the crew‚Äôs mess, cold storage, and cabins for the cook. On the right side was a bathroom, lavatory, storeroom, waiter‚Äôs room, express room, and mail room. Also on the main deck were six cabins with bunks for 12 men.  Saloon deck  Next above the main deck was the saloon deck, which was devoted almost entirely to passenger accommodations. In the center of the saloon deck was a dining room which could seat 60 people at its six main tables. The ceiling of the dining room extended through the next deck, creating an impressive effect, similar to ocean-going or coastal steamships of the time. Forward of the dining room on the left side was the steward‚Äôs office and room, and on the right side was the purser‚Äôs office. There were also 14 staterooms on the saloon deck, and, in the forward area, a smoking room with curved sides and large windows. At the rear of the saloon deck was the ladies‚Äô saloon.  Gallery deck  Interior of gallery deck overlooking salon deck on Bonnington, sister ship of Nasookin. Above the saloon deck was the gallery deck, so named because of the gallery around the interior of the deck that overlooked the dining room on the saloon deck. The gallery deck had 25 three- berth staterooms. Forward on the gallery deck was the ladies‚Äô observation lounge, while to the rear on this deck was another men‚Äôs smoking room. The chief engineer also had a cabin on the gallery deck.  Texas deck and pilot house  Above the saloon deck was the texas deck, so named because of a cabin structure, called a texas that was built on this deck. The texas housed a further 18 three-berth staterooms, as well as cabins for the captain and officers, and a room for the boat‚Äôs watchman. The pilot house was located on top of the texas, just above the captain‚Äôs cabin.  Construction  The steel hull of Nasookin was built by the Northwestern Shipbuilding and Drydock Company of Port Arthur, Ontario. The hull was then disassembled for shipment by rail to British Columbia to be reassembled for service on Kootenay Lake. Assembly of Nasookin began in the fall of 1912 at the CPR shipyard at Nelson, British Columbia. Several hundred men were reported to be at work on the vessel. Construction was supervised by the chief engineer of the CPR‚Äôs Lake and River Service, David Stephens. James M. Bulger master shipbuilder, and J. French, yard foreman, also managed the work.  Dimensions  When built, Nasookin was the largest sternwheeler in British Columbia and the largest sternwheeler north of San Francisco. Nasookin was reported to have been long, exclusive of the extension of the main deck over the stern, called the ‚Äúfantail‚Äù, on which the stern-wheel was mounted. Including the fantail, the length overall was . The beam was , which would have been exclusive of the long protective timbers running alongside the top of the hull, called guards. Nasookin was projected to draw about 5 feet of water. From the top of the pilot house to the waterline was about 50 feet. Overall size of Nasookin was 1869 gross tons 1035 net tons, with ton in this case being a measure of volume and not weight. Nasookin was reported to have cost $200,000 to build. Nasookin was capable of carrying 550 passengers on day trips, with overnight accommodations for 170.  Engineering  Nasookin was propelled by a stern- wheel turned by twin compound horizontally-mounted steam engines, each with cylinder bores (high pressure) and (low pressure) and a piston stroke of . Another source reports slightly larger piston bore diameters. The boilers produced steam at a pressure of 200 lbs P.S.I. The boilers were coal-fired. According to one source, the stern-wheel shaft was , with a core. A contemporaneous source reported the stern-wheel was about 20 feet wide, with a diameter of 24 feet. Each paddle blade, called a ‚Äúbucket‚Äù was 25 inches wide. Electricity for the six hundred 16 candle power lights on board was produced by a 25 watt dynamo. Before launching, Nasookin was expected to be able to reach a speed of per hour, an hour faster than Bonnington, on the Arrow Lakes.  Launch and trial run  Launch of Nasookin, April 30, 1913. Nasookin was launched on April 30, 1913 before a crowd estimated at 2,000 people. The vessel was decorated with flags and bunting. Barges were moored alongside the launch site so that more people could see the launch. The steam tug Ymir and the sternwheeler Nelson also carried sightseers. The launch went well and the new steamer would be ready to run in a week or so, because much of the finish work had already been completed. Nasookin made its trial run on May 4, 1913 under Captain McKinnon, with David Stephens acting as chief engineer. The vessel went up the west arm of Kootenay Lake to Procter and then into the main lake. The trip was a success. The formal maiden run of Nasookin was taken on Victoria Day, May 25, 1913, with the boat embarking its full licensed passenger capacity of 550 persons.  Career  The CPR intended Nasookin to be able to handle the growing local business on Kootenay Lake as well as tourism which CPR was in the process of developing. CPR intended that at least in the summer months when traffic was at its busiest, that Nasookin replace Kuskanook on the route on the lake between Procter and Kootenay Landing, British Columbia. By August 1913, Nasookin was running between Nelson and Kootenay Landing, connecting at each point with CPR trains. J.V. Murphy was the CPR‚Äôs district passenger agent in Nelson, B.C. In September 1913, CPR offered ‚Äúreduced rates‚Äù to the Spokane Interstate Fair, to be held from September 15 to September 21, in Spokane, Washington. Fare from Greenwood would be $15.15. Fare from Phoenix would be a little bit more, $15.30. In May 1915, Nasookin was reported to be ready to return to service ‚Äúas soon as traffic warrants it.‚Äù On April 1, 1916, Nasookin resumed its route on the West Arm of Kootenay Lake after having been taken out of service for months because of ice on the lake. On Sunday, July 14, 1929, the town of Creston, BC had the ‚Äúbiggest auto tourist day‚Äù so far that year, when Nasookin loaded 26 automobiles headed west at Kuskanook, BC.  Auto ferry  Nasookin with decks cut down in use as an auto ferry. By 1931, CPR had no further use for Nasookin. A railway had been completed from Kootenay Landing to Nelson, and steamboat service between the two points was no longer required. CPR leased Nasookin to the government of British Columbia, to be used to carry motor vehicles from Frasers Landing, which was located near Proctor, on the north side of the west arm of the lake, to Gray Creek on Crawford Bay. At first, the only modification to Nasookin was to remove the extension of the passenger deck from the house to the bow, to permit larger vehicles such as buses to be carried. First the province leased Nasookin, and then, in 1933, purchased the vessel outright. The upper decks of Nasookin had made the steamer difficult to handle in a cross wind, so it was taken to Nelson and extensively rebuilt, with the cabins on the texas deck completely removed, and the pilot house placed on top of the truncated gallery deck. The steamer became less attractive but more functional, and was able to run for another 15 years. Disposition Nasookin was replaced by a twin-propeller ferry in 1947. Nasookin was then sold to Norman C. Stibbs (1885-1972)., who then transferred the steamer to the Navy League of Canada for use as a training vessel. In 1948, there were record high levels on Kootenay Lake, and Nasookin broke free from its moorings. The steamer was tied up, but no one paid much care to its location. A concrete wall, not visible under the high water, was under Nasookin‚Äôs hull, and when the water level fell, the sternwheeler settled on the wall, cracking the hull beyond repair. In 1950, Nasookin was sold to Earle Cutler, who stripped the parts out of the steamer. The hull was towed away in 1954. Portions of the upper works were made into a house.

The May Company building is now empty, but the center remains anchored by a supermarket. History In April 1940, Santa Anita Village, an early suburban housing development, petitioned the Arcadia city council for a zoning change to permit an 18-acre shopping center along Huntington Drive at Michillinda to be known as the Santa Anita Village Shopping Center. When the shopping center opened in 1948, it advertised as the El Rancho Santa Anita Shopping Center. It opened with a supermarket in 1948 but the official opening wasn't until 1950, when it also opened the first elevator in Arcadia. Competition nearby at the time included a local department store, Hinshaw's in a retail cluster along Baldwin Avenue, but the much larger Santa Anita Fashion Park was only built much later in 1974. On October 8, 1966, the May Company opened a large branch here, its fourteenth store in California, designed by Victor Gruen and Associates with Spanish colonial interiors by Welton Becket and Associates. The store closed in the late 1980s and was bought by Vons Cos., parent company of Vons supermarkets, and converted to that company's new headquarters until the brand was purchased by Albertsons, and the headquarters function was moved to Albertsons' regional office in Fullerton.

After a two-year public fundraising effort, it was created in 1895 by sculptor John Cassidy and erected on a plinth of Portland stone. It was designated a Grade II listed structure in 1977. The statue has been subject to increasing controversy since the 1990s, when Colston's prior reputation as a philanthropist came under scrutiny due to his involvement in the Atlantic slave trade. An effort began in July 2018 to reword the plaque to include details on Colston's role in the slave trade, however a new wording was not agreed upon. On 7 June 2020, the statue was toppled, defaced, and pushed into Bristol Harbour during the George Floyd protests related to the Black Lives Matter movement. The plinth was also covered in graffiti, but remains in place. The statue was recovered from the harbour and put into safe storage by Bristol City Council on 11 June. Description Detail of one of the dolphins The monument originally consisted of an bronze statue of Edward Colston set on top of a plinth. The statue depicts Colston in a flowing wig, velvet coat, satin waistcoat, and knee-breeches as was typical in his day. The plinth is made of Portland stone and adorned with bronze plaques and figures of dolphins. Of the four plaquesone on each face of the plinththree are relief sculptures in an Art Nouveau style: two of these depict scenes from Colston's life and the third exhibits a maritime fantasy. The plaque on the south face bears the words \\"Erected by citizens of Bristol as a memorial of one of the most virtuous and wise sons of their city AD 1895\\" and \\"John Cassidy fecit\\" (John Cassidy made this). Background=Edward Colston Colston was a Bristol-born merchant who made some of his fortune from the slave trade, particularly between 1680 and 1692. He was an active member of the Royal African Company, and was briefly deputy governor in 1689‚Äì90. During his tenure, the Company transported an estimated 84,000 slaves from West Africa to the Americas. Colston used his wealth to provide financial support to almshouses, hospitals, schools, workhouses and churches throughout England, particularly in his home city of Bristol; he represented the Bristol constituency as its Member of Parliament from 1710 to 1713. He left ¬£71,000 to charities after his death, as well as ¬£100,000 to members of his family. In the 19th century he was seen as a philanthropist. The fact that much of his fortune was made in the slave trade was largely ignored until the 1990s. Statue The statue, designed by Irish sculptor John Cassidy, was erected in the area now known as The Centre in 1895 to commemorate Colston's philanthropy. It was proposed by James Arrowsmith, the president of the Anchor Society. Several appeals to the public and Colston-related charitable bodies, over the course of a two-year fundraising effort, raised ¬£650, which was less than the amount needed for its casting and erection. The remaining balance, ¬£150, was given by an anonymous donor. Alumni of Colston's School were also invited to participate. The statue was unveiled by the mayor, Howell Davies, and the bishop of Bristol, Charles Ellicott, on 13 November 1895, a date which had been referred to as Colston Day in the city. Further funds were raised after the unveiling, including a contribution from the Society of Merchant Venturers. On 4 March 1977, it was designated as a Grade II listed structure. Historic England described the statue as being \\"handsome\\" and that \\"the resulting contrast of styles is handled with confidence\\". They also note that the statue offers good group value with other memorials, including a statue of Edmund Burke, the Cenotaph, and a drinking fountain commemorating the Industrial and Fine Art Exhibition of 1893. Controversy=20th century Art installation, showing figures representing slaves on a ship, during Anti- Slavery Day 2018 The statue became controversial by the end of the 20th century, as Colston's activities as a major slave trader became more widely known. H. J. Wilkins, who uncovered his slave-trading activities in 1920, commented that \\"we cannot picture him justly except against his historical background\\". Colston's involvement in the slave trade predated the abolition movement in Britain, and was during the time when \\"slavery was generally condoned in England‚Äîindeed, throughout Europe‚Äîby churchmen, intellectuals and the educated classes\\". From the 1990s onwards, campaigns and petitions called for the removal of the statue and described it as a disgrace. In 1992, the statue was depicted in the installation Commemoration Day by Carole Drake, as part of the Trophies of Empire exhibition at the Arnolfini, a gallery in a former tea warehouse in Bristol's harbour. Drake's installation combined a replica of the statue swinging above rotting chrysanthemums, a favourite flower of Colston, in front of a projected photograph of schoolgirls at Colston School covering his statue with flowers in 1973 and the audio of the school hymn \\"Rejoice ye pure in heart\\". In the 1994 catalogue of Trophies of Empire, Drake stated the work refers to: In January 1998, \\"SLAVE TRADER\\" was written in paint on the base of the statue. Bristol City councillor Ray Sefia said: \\"If we in this city want to glorify the slave trade, then the statue should stay. If not, the statue should be marked with a plaque that he was a slave trader or taken down.\\" 21st century In a 2014 poll in the local newspaper, the Bristol Post, 56% of the 1,100 respondents said it should stay while 44% wanted it to go. Others called for a memorial plaque honouring the victims of slavery to be fitted to his statue. Bristol's first elected mayor, George Ferguson, stated on Twitter in 2013 that \\"Celebrations for Colston are perverse, not something I shall be taking part in!\\" In August 2017 an unauthorized commemorative plaque by sculptor Will Coles was affixed to the statue's plinth, which declared that Bristol was the \\"Capital of the Atlantic Slave Trade 1730‚Äì1745\\" and memorialising \\"the 12,000,000 enslaved of whom 6,000,000 died as captives\\". Cole stated that his aim was \\"to try to get people to think\\". The plaque was removed by Bristol City Council in October of the same year. In 2018, Thangam Debbonaire, Labour MP for Bristol West, wrote to Bristol City Council calling for the removal of the statue. A petition to remove the statue had garnered more than 11,000 signatures. An unofficial art installation appeared in front of the statue on 18 October 2018 to mark Anti- Slavery Day in the UK. It depicted about a hundred supine figures arranged as on a slave ship, lying as if they were cargo, surrounded by a border listing jobs typically done by modern-day slaves such as 'fruit picker' and 'nail bar worker'; it remained for some months. The labels around the bow of the ship said 'here and now'. Another artistic intervention saw a ball and chain attached to the statue. = Rewording the plaque = In July 2018, Bristol City Council, which was responsible for the statue, made a planning application to add a second plaque which would \\"add to the public knowledge about Colston\\" including his philanthropy and his involvement in slave trading, though the initial wording suggested came in for significant criticism and re-wording took place. The initial wording of the second plaque mentioned Colston's role in the slave trade, his brief tenure as a Tory MP for Bristol, and criticised his philanthropy as religiously selective: The Society of Merchant Venturers, an organisation of which Colston was a member, objected to the wording and a Bristol Conservative councillor called it \\"revisionist\\" and \\"historically illiterate\\". A second version, co-written by Madge Dresser (an associate professor of history at the University of Bristol) was proposed by the council in 2018, giving a brief description of Colston's philanthropy, role in the slave trade, and time as an MP, while noting that he was now considered controversial. This wording was edited by a former curator at the Bristol Museum and Art Gallery, creating a third proposal that was backed by the Bristol Civic Society. However, it was criticised by Dresser, who claimed the version was a \\"sanitised\\" version of history, arguing the wording minimised Colston's role, omitted the number of child slaves, and focused on West Africans as the original enslavers. The third version was reported to have been written by a member of the Society of Merchant Venturers. A bronze plaque was cast with the following wording: However, after the plaque was physically produced, its installation was vetoed in March 2019 by Bristol's mayor, Marvin Rees, who criticised the Society of Merchant Venturers for the phrasing. A statement from the mayor's office called it \\"unacceptable\\", claimed that Rees had not been consulted, and promised to continue work on a second plaque. In June 2020 the Society of Merchant Venturers stated it was \\"inappropriate\\" for the society to have become involved in the rewording of the plaque in 2018. Toppling and removal alt=Street map of central Bristol with a red line showing the route from original location south towards the western edge of the harbour On 7 June 2020, during the global protests following the killing of George Floyd in the United States, the statue was pulled down by demonstrators who then jumped on it. They daubed it in red and blue paint, and one protester placed his knee on the statue's neck to allude to Floyd's death under a knee of a white policeman. The statue was then rolled down Anchor Road and pushed into Bristol Harbour. Superintendent Andy Bennett of Avon and Somerset Police stated that they had made a \\"tactical decision\\" not to intervene and had allowed the statue to be toppled, citing a concern that stopping the act could have led to further violence and a riot. They also stated that the act was criminal damage and confirmed that there would be an investigation to identify those involved, adding that they were in the process of collating footage of the incident. Reaction On 7 June, the Home Secretary, Priti Patel, called the toppling \\"utterly disgraceful\\", \\"completely unacceptable\\", and \\"sheer vandalism\\". She added, \\"it speaks to the acts of public disorder that have become a distraction from the cause people are protesting about.\\" The Mayor of Bristol Marvin Rees said those comments showed an \\"absolute lack of understanding\\". On 8 June Rees said that the statue was an affront, and he felt no \\"sense of loss [at its removal],\\" but that the statue would be retrieved and it was \\"highly likely that the Colston statue will end up in one of our museums.\\" The historian and television presenter David Olusoga commented that the statue should have been taken down earlier, saying: \\"Statues are about saying 'this was a great man who did great things'. That is not true, he [Colston] was a slave trader and a murderer.\\" Police Superintendent Andy Bennett also stated he understood that Colston was \\"a historical figure that's caused the black community quite a lot of angst over the last couple of years\\", adding: \\"Whilst I am disappointed that people would damage one of our statues, I do understand why it's happened, it's very symbolic.\\" alt=The pedestal is seen with purple spraypaint graffiti \\"BLM\\" over two of the bronze plaques and black \\"Black Lives Matter\\" and stencilled raised fists on the plinth. Placards propped on the pedestal include \\"Black Lives Matter\\", \\"Silence is Violence\\", \\"The UK is not innocent\\" and \\"In unity is strength\\". Many more placards lie on the ground around the pedestal, with \\"Black Lives Matter\\",\\"Racism is a global pandemic\\" and other slogans. Rees made a statement suggesting that \\"it's important to listen to those who found the statue to represent an affront to humanity and make the legacy of today about the future of our city, tackling racism and inequality. I call on everyone to challenge racism and inequality in every corner of our city and wherever we see it.\\" In an interview with Krishnan Guru-Murthy, he said, \\"We have a statue of someone who made their money by throwing our people into water ... and now he's on the bottom of the water.\\" In a separate interview, Rees commented that the statue would probably be retrieved from the harbour \\"at some point\\", and could end up in a city museum. Rees confirmed that placards left by protesters will be put on display at the M Shed museum in Bristol. A spokesperson for Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, said that he \\"absolutely understands the strength of feeling\\" but insisted that the democratic process should have been followed, and that police should hold responsible those involved in the criminal act. Labour leader Keir Starmer said while the manner in which the statue had been pulled down was \\"completely wrong\\", it should have been removed \\"a long, long time ago\\". He added \\"you can't, in 21st Century Britain, have a slaver on a statue. That statue should have been brought down properly, with consent, and put in a museum.\\" The Society of Merchant Venturers, in a statement on 12 June, said that \\"the fact that it [the statue] has gone is right for Bristol. To build a city where racism and inequality no longer exist, we must start by acknowledging Bristol's dark past and removing statues, portraits and names that memorialise a man who benefitted from trading in human lives.\\" Retrieval and storage Statue in storage after retrieval At 5 am on 11 June 2020, the statue was retrieved from Bristol Harbour by Bristol City Council, who plan to clean it to prevent corrosion before exhibiting it in a museum without removing the graffiti and ropes placed on it by the protesters. Whilst cleaning mud from the statue, M Shed discovered an 1895 issue of Tit-Bits magazine containing a handwritten date, 26 October 1895, and the names of those who originally fitted the statue. Police investigation The day after the toppling, the police announced that they identified 17 people in connection with the incident, but had not yet made any arrests. On 22 June 2020 the police released images of people connected to the incident, and asked the public for help identifying the individuals. On 1 July, a 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage to the statue. In September 2020, Avon and Somerset Police said that files on four people suspected of criminal damage had been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service to decide if charges should be brought. A further five people had been offered restorative justice, such as a fine and/or community service.. Retrieved 23 September 2020 Subsequent events After the toppling of Colston's statue, a similar monument to Robert Milligan, the slave factor who was largely responsible for the construction of the West India Docks, was removed peacefully after opposition in east London by the Tower Hamlets council on 9 June 2020. On the same day, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan called for London statues and street names with links to slavery to be removed or renamed. Khan set up the Commission for Diversity in the Public Realm to review London's landmarks. After the statue was removed, a petition began to have a statue of Paul Stephenson erected in its place. The former Bristol youth worker is a black man who was instrumental in the 1963 Bristol Bus Boycott, inspired by the US Montgomery bus boycott, which brought an end to a then-legal employment colour ban in Bristol bus companies. In what a local councillor believed was retaliation, the headstone and footstone for the enslaved man Scipio Africanus were vandalised in the churchyard of St Mary's Church, Henbury, on 17 June. The attacker broke one of the stones in two and scrawled a warning to \\"put Colston's statue back or things will really heat up.\\" In the early morning of 15 July 2020, a statue by Marc Quinn was added to the empty plinth without permission from the authorities. The statue, entitled A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020 depicts a Black Lives Matter protester with a raised fist. Quinn described it as a \\"new temporary, public installation\\". Bristol City Council removed the statue on the morning of 16 July, and said it would be held in their museum \\"for the artist to collect or donate to our collection\\".

In 1993 Smith was named the winner of the J. G. Taylor Spink Award, which was awarded at the 1994 Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremonies. Life and career A Detroit native, Smith graduated from West Virginia State College where he pitched on the baseball team. One day after winning a game, a major league scout approached him and said that he wished that he could sign him, but couldn't due to baseball's color barrier, and instead signed the opposing pitcher. Thereafter, Smith promised himself that he'd do whatever he could to see an African-American play major league baseball. He also became the sports editor for the college's newspaper his junior year. He began his professional writing career in 1937 with the Pittsburgh Courier, then the most popular paper within the black community in the country. He started as a sports writer and then a sports editor the year after. He covered the Homestead Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords of baseball's Negro Leagues for the Courier. Smith also petitioned the Baseball Writers' Association of America for membership but was turned down because he was with the Courier and not one of the white-owned papers. Smith is credited with recommending Jackie Robinson to Brooklyn Dodgers general manager Branch Rickey who was searching for the individual with strong character to successfully execute the integration of baseball. The Courier offered to pay for Smith to travel with Robinson, who had to stay in separate hotels from his teammates due to segregation policies prevalent at the time. Smith traveled with Robinson in the minors in 1946 and with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947.Strauss, Ben. \\"Friendship as Priceless as the National Pastime,\\" The New York Times, Wednesday, August 22, 2012. In 1948 Smith released his book, Jackie Robinson: My Own Story. Later Smith moved on to Chicago and joined the white-owned Chicago Herald-American. Smith left his baseball beat and covered mostly boxing for the American. In 1948, his application to join the BBWAA was approved, and he became the first African American member of the organization, though he would become the second member of the BBWAA behind Sam Lacey. Smith moved to television in 1964 when he joined Chicago television station WGN as a sports anchor, though he continued to write a weekly column for the Chicago Sun-Times. Smith died of pancreatic cancer at age 58 in 1972, just a month after Robinson. Smith had been too ill to attend Robinson's funeral, but he wrote Robinson's obituary.Plaschke, Bill. \\"As Jackie Robinson was making history, Wendell Smith wrote it.\\" The Los Angeles Times, April 14, 2013. In 1993, he was a posthumous recipient of the J. G. Taylor Spink Award for excellence in journalism. In 1994 Smith was inducted into The Baseball Hall of Fame. His widow Wyonella Smith donated his papers to the Hall of Fame's archives in 1996, providing invaluable research material on the subject of baseball's integration. DePaul University and the University of Notre Dame have presented the Wendell Smith Award to the best player of each game between the schools' men's basketball teams since the 1972‚Äì73 season.DePaul Basketball A-to-Z ‚Äì DePaul University Athletics. In 2014, Smith was the recipient of sports journalism's prestigious Red Smith Award. In popular culture Andre Holland portrayed Smith in the 2013 film 42, which tells the story of Jackie Robinson's selection to play for the Dodgers, his professional ordeals, and his early minor and major league play.

History = Townsend Thoresen and P&O;  Ford was Chairman of Townsend Thoresen at the time of the MS Herald of Free Enterprise disaster in 1987. Following the disaster, Ford was criticised for underestimating the number of people killed in the disaster.  London Transport  Ford was appointed as Chairman of London Regional Transport (LT) in September 1994, replacing Sir Wilfrid Newton. During Ford's tenure, the number of passengers on London Underground and London Buses continued to rise \\\\- however cuts by the Treasury of ¬£375m and cost overruns of ¬£500m on the Jubilee Line Extension project increased the maintenance backlog on the Underground and worsened LT's financial position. In April 1998, amid furore over the potential imposition of Public private partnership (PPP) on London Underground, Ford was removed as Chairman of LT by then Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott due to his opposition to PPP. Following this, Ford was highly critical of the government‚Äôs plan during a select committee, stating that \\"It‚Äôs going to be very difficult to make it work, and I think there is a very big element of uncertainty about the whole thing\\".

He was the second principal of the West Virginia Colored Institute (present-day West Virginia State University) from 1894 until 1898. West Virginia State considers him its second president. Hill was born into slavery in 1852 in Charles Town, Virginia, (present-day West Virginia). During the American Civil War, he relocated to Maine where he studied law. He became Maine's second African- American lawyer in 1879, and became West Virginia's first African-American lawyer after his admission to the bar of Jefferson County‚Äôs circuit court in 1881. Hill then served in the 10th Cavalry Regiment for six years, during which time he participated in the Apache Wars. He was a schoolteacher and then principal at Shepherdstown‚Äôs African-American public school, Shadyside School, from 1889 until 1893, and then served as the second principal of the West Virginia Colored Institute from 1894 until 1898. Hill resigned as principal to serve in the United States Volunteers during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War from 1898 to 1899. Hill returned to the institute in 1899, when he was appointed Commandant of Cadets and professor of mathematics, and remained there until 1903. Following his death in 1936, West Virginia State named Hill Hall in his honor.  Early life and education  John Henry Hill was born on July 4, 1852, in Charles Town, Virginia, (present-day West Virginia). Hill was born into slavery, under the ownership of the William Alexander family. William Alexander was later named as Hill's natural father. Hill was also a descendant of slaves who had served in George Washington's household. Towards the end of the American Civil War, Hill ran away from his home and was then captured by Union soldiers. At the age of thirteen, Major J. H. Whitmore of the 15th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment took him to Maine. Major Whitmore's father, Samuel Whitmore, then took him in and provided him with a fundamental education. While in Maine, Hill studied Latin and attended Litchfield Academy. Hill later attended Bowdoin College, although he did not finish his coursework there.  Legal and military careers  Hill taught in schools to pay for his study expenses, and from 1877 to 1879, he worked at the law office of Tallman and Larrabee while he studied law. On April 11, 1879, Judge Charles J. Faulkner Jr. qualified Hill to practice law at the bar of the Supreme Judicial Court of Sagadahoc County, Maine. Hill became Maine's second African-American lawyer after Macon Bolling Allen. Hill returned to his native Jefferson County, West Virginia, to serve its African-American community. In 1881, Hill became the first African American to be admitted to the bar of the Jefferson County Circuit Court. He became West Virginia's first African-American lawyer. While in Jefferson County, Hill also served as an assistant instructor on the board of teachers for Storer College in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, in 1881. Hill practiced law in Jefferson County until 1882, when he enlisted in the 10th Cavalry Regiment of the United States Army. He was formally enlisted at Cincinnati, Ohio, on October 23, 1882. Hill served in the 10th Cavalry Regiment for six years, during which time he participated in the campaign against Geronimo in the Apache Wars. He was honorably discharged with the military rank of regimental quartermaster sergeant.  Educational career = Schoolteacher and principal  Following his discharge from military service, Hill returned to Charles Town, and became a schoolteacher in Shepherdstown, West Virginia. African-American historian Carter G. Woodson wrote that Hill was the \\"most prominent teacher that Shepherdstown had\\" and that the community remembered him for the efficiency of his work. Hill served as the principal of Shepherdstown's African-American public school known as Shadyside School. Shadyside School, Shepherdstown's second school for African Americans, had replaced the town's Old School‚Äîthe town's first public school for African Americans‚Äîin 1883. As principal, Hill commenced the 1889 school year with 63 students, and the 1890 school year with a record 65 students. The school's board of trustees reappointed him to this position in 1891. Hill sought to add grade levels to Shadyside School and worked to standardize instruction there. He served as the school's principal until 1893, when Alexander Freeman succeeded him in this position. While in Shepherdstown, Hill was a proponent of the temperance movement, and in May 1890, he delivered an address to a temperance meeting at Shepherdstown's African Methodist Episcopal Church.  West Virginia Colored Institute  Fleming Hall at West Virginia Colored Institute (1910) In 1893, Hill was appointed as the English professor and assistant principal of the West Virginia Colored Institute in Farm, West Virginia, (present-day Institute). A. S. Dandridge, Jefferson County's representative to the West Virginia Legislature, championed Hill's appointment to the institute. The institute had been founded in 1891 under the Morrill Act of 1890, to provide West Virginia's African Americans with education in agricultural and mechanical studies. Following the resignation of the institute's principal James Edwin Campbell in 1894, the president of the Board of Regents appointed Hill to finish Campbell's unexpired term. In June 1894, at the regular meeting of the board, Hill was elected and duly installed as the second principal of the West Virginia Colored Institute. Hill presided over the institute's first commencement. By May 1898, the faculty under Hill consisted of C. E. Jones teaching natural science and history, Byrd Prillerman teaching English and mental science, James M. Canty teaching mechanics and mechanical drawing, Hill's wife Etta Hill teaching music, drawing, and Latin, and Flayvilla D. Brown teaching sewing. In addition to his duties as principal, Hill also taught mathematics. Throughout his tenure as principal at the institute, Hill and his wife resided in Fleming Hall. As the institute's principal, Hill was a member of the West Virginia Teachers' Association. He participated in the association's third annual meeting in Parkersburg in 1893, and at the association's fourth annual meeting in Montgomery in 1894, Hill was appointed to a committee to urge the West Virginia Legislature to make an appropriation to the West Virginia Colored Institute's teaching fund. He attended the association's fifth meeting in Hinton in 1895 and the sixth meeting in Charleston in 1896, where he provided the welcoming remarks. Hill resigned his position as principal in 1898 to fight in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, and he was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the 8th United States Infantry Volunteer Immunes of the United States Volunteers on July 19, 1898. He was also appointed as the regimental commissary officer. In addition to Hill, six of the institute's students enlisted, four of whom were made non- commissioned officers. Hill was honorably discharged the next year on March 6, 1899. Following his resignation, the Board of Regents placed James M. Canty of the Mechanical Department in charge of the school until the board's election of James McHenry Jones in September 1898. Hill returned to the institute when he was appointed as Commandant of Cadets and professor of mathematics in June 1899. As commandant, Hill led the institute's cadets in West Virginia military parades. In February 1900, Hill announced his candidacy for a Kanawha County seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates. Hill was the only African- American candidate for a legislative seat in West Virginia's primary elections. He narrowly lost to Shelton Johnson in the Republican primary in May 1900.  Later life and death  Hill resigned from his positions at the West Virginia Colored Institute in 1903 and spent the following year traveling across the Western United States and Mexico. He then resided in Oklahoma before returning to West Virginia in 1913. During World War I, Hill served as a welfare worker in the coalfields of Southern West Virginia. Following the war, Hill worked as an assistant at the West Virginia Workmen's Department of Compensation in nearby Charleston, and he remained in this position until 1929. Declining health led to Hill resigning from this position. Hill visited the institute (then known as West Virginia Collegiate Institute) in November 1922, and delivered a presentation on \\"Mexico and Its People\\", based upon his personal knowledge from his travels in Mexico. While Hill no longer worked directly for the institute, he continued his affiliation with the school as an occasional lecturer at student assemblies and informal advisor to students. In 1933, Hill published Princess Malah, a historical novel about a slave on the plantation of Samuel Washington, George Washington's brother. Hill wrote Princess Malah \\"to depict the relationships existing between the master and slave in the period of our history just prior to the Revolutionary War\\". As a descendant of slaves in George Washington's household, Hill grew up listening to stories about the private lives of the Washington family. In Hill's novel, Princess Malah is the daughter of Lawrence Washington and the rightful heiress to Mount Vernon. In 1935, West Virginia's State Board of Education honored Hill's service to West Virginia State College by naming him the college's president emeritus. In April 1936, Hill was a founding member of the West Virginia sustaining membership committee of the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History. In May 1936, as president emeritus, Hill participated in West Virginia State's Founder's Day exercises on the 44th anniversary of the college's opening. Hill died of sepsis on October 13, 1936, at his home in Institute. His funeral services were held at West Virginia State, and he was interred at Institute Cemetery.  Legacy  West Virginia State University's Hill Hall is named for Hill. Hill Hall was a dormitory for upper-class women, and was built between 1936 and 1937 and renovated in 1979. Hill Hall formerly housed West Virginia State's Counseling and Tutoring Center, Upward Bound, and Special Services. Hill Hall currently houses the university's Business Administration, Economics, English, History, Modern Foreign Language, Political Science, and Sociology Departments.  Personal life  On the morning of New Year's Day in January 1889, Hill married Etta Lovett in Harpers Ferry. According to The Shepherdstown Register, the \\"marriage was conducted very quietly on account of the recent death\\" of Lovett's father. Prior to her marriage, Lovett was the organist for Storer College in Harpers Ferry.

History The original Cock Hotel in 1789. This hotel was partially demolished in 1898, before The Cock sign had been built. The Cock Hotel in Sutton was so named as London and Sutton were an historic centre for cockfighting. It was on a main road from London to Brighton, and at one point in history, it was used as a post office. The hotel was at one time owned by boxer John Johnson, also known as \\"Gentleman Jackson\\", who earnt the boxing title Champion of England. In 1898, the original Cock Hotel was partially demolished so that the street could be widened. The Cock sign was built in 1907 by Hart, Son, Peard and Co. It originally stood on a timber frame outside The Cock Hotel and pub on Sutton High Street. When the hotel was completely demolished in 1914, the sign was moved to its present location on the crossroads of Sutton High Street and Carshalton Road. In around 1915, The Cock sign was converted into a road sign. At that time, the name of the hotel was removed from the sign. The Cock sign is on a column, made out of steel and wrought iron. Originally the sign had a gas-lit light, and two lanterns. The light was later converted to use electricity, and the lanterns were removed before the sign was moved in 1915. The fingerposts on The Cock sign point to Cheam, Worcester Park, Carshalton, Croydon, Banstead, Reigate, Mitcham, and London. The road layout was changed in the late 20th century, but The Cock sign remained. The crossroads where the sign stands is known as The Cock crossroads, and is situated a few metres away from the location of The Cock hotel and pub. In 2018, The Cock sign became a Grade II listed building. It was one of three places in South London that Historic England listed in 2018.

In 2020 he was appointed non-executive director of Free Eyre Ltd and its subsidiary Peninsula Ports Pty Ltd, with the expectation of the company realising the Port Spencer project in South Australia ahead of the summer of 2020-21.  Career  Toll joined BHP after graduating from the University of Queensland with a degree in Mining Engineering in 1968. There he helped the company establish its iron ore projects through to the mid 1970s before moving to its chief competitor, Rio Tinto. He received a Master‚Äôs degree in Business Science in 1981 from Columbia University, New York, before going on to work around the world raising funds and developing mining projects in Mongolia, Brazil, Venezuela and Indonesia. In the late 1990s, Toll was involved in the reconstruction of Savage River magnetite and pellet operations in Tasmania. Since that time Toll has acted as director and or chairman for various mining and mineral exploration companies. He was founding chairman of Fortescue Metals Group (2005-2007) and chairman of Braemar Infrastructure, which seeks to develop iron ore projects in South Australia's north-east. In 2011, Toll was an Independent non-executive director at vertically integrated steelmaker Evraz, where he was also Chairman of the Health, Safety and Environmental Committee. At the time he was also Executive Chairman of Satimola Limited, a potash development company operating in Kazakhstan. In 2012, Toll was described as the founder and former chairman of Ferrous Resources, a Brazilian iron ore mining company and the deputy chairman of Ivanhoe Mines. In 2014 he was a major shareholder in Royal Resources, owning 22.51% of the company. From 2014 to 2018, he was chairman of Magnetite Mines, when it was seeking to develop the Razorback prospect between Burra and Broken Hill. At the time he was soliciting Chinese engineering companies and rich individuals to invest, while approaching steel mills and commodities traders that might also buy some of the mine's product. By 2017 Gordon Toll claimed to have raised over $5 billion in investment for projects he had associated with. Toll has also previously worked as an executive with Atlantic Richfield and Texas Gulf. Toll intends to partner with Chinese investors to enable new iron ore mines in South Australia and develop innovative solutions for the export of bulk minerals.

Oakmont Resources legal actions  Oakmont Resources is a start-up iron ore mining company founded in 2009 by series one Australian Masterchef contestant, Aaron Thomas. By 2014 the company had commenced mining and had mined 250,000 tonnes of iron ore in Brazil. Gordon Toll and Guy Saxton sued fellow company director Aaron Thomas for spending millions of dollars on luxury expenses that he claimed were entitlements. Aaron responded by stating that \\"The legal action in the UK and US is blatant thuggery instigated by questionable individuals with colourful track records\\" and alleged that Toll and Saxton acted ‚Äúto enrich themselves, without paying what they owe to the Company‚Äù. The company directors then became the target of an unfair dismissal counterclaim by Thomas. Thomas described Toll and Saxton's actions as a \\"dirty tricks\\" campaign to increase their shareholding by ousting him from the company that he founded.  Appearance in Paradise papers  Toll appears in the ICIJ's Offshore Leaks Database as a signatory for or the ultimate beneficial owner of numerous companies located in the Isle of Man, a known tax haven.

Population history This population was very heavily exploited by whalers in the 19th century and collapsed around 1850. 13 adults were found in the early 1970s and held at the Charles Darwin Research Station as a breeding colony. The two males and 11 females were initially brought to the Darwin Station. Fortuitously, a third male (Diego) was discovered at the San Diego Zoo and joined the others in a captive breeding program. Mating had not occurred naturally for some time, because the individuals were so scattered that they did not meet. Following the successful captive breeding program, large numbers have been released back into the wild and are now breeding on their own. Description It is one of the smallest species of Gal√°pagos tortoise. Its black, saddle-backed carapace has a deep cervical indentation, the anterior rim only weakly upturned, and posterior marginals downturned and slightly serrated. It is narrow anteriorly and wider posteriorly. thumb Etymology Its species name, composed of hood and the Latin suffix -ensis: \\"who lives in\\", was given in reference to the place of its discovery, Espa√±ola Island, which is also called Hood Island.

Hermeneutics \\"hermeneutics\\". Collins English Dictionary. is the theory and methodology of interpretation, especially of sacred texts, and Islamic feminism has a long history to draw on. Muslim feminists reinterpret gendered Islamic texts and challenge interpretive traditions (e.g. exegesis, jurisprudence, Hadith compilations) to promote the ideas of gender equality.Hidayatullah p. 301.Mardinsyah p. 3. The hermeneutics of feminism in Islam puts gender equality and justice as the foundation of Islamic morality. This system of interpretation critically deconstructs interpretations and perceptions related to women.Mardinsyah p. 108. It employs various tools and methods of argument. These include focussing on women (against conventional male centrist gender bias), giving primacy to equality and gender justice, finding relevant religious texts to reinterpret, and investigating, contesting and exposing historical contexts of religious texts and conservative interpretations which cause suffering and perpetuate injustice and inequality.  History and Context  Day today social, cultural and political behavior of Muslim individuals, groups, institutions and states gets deeply influenced by Islamic advice literature including religious interpretive traditions. In Muslim world process of interpreting Quran (exegesis) is usually referred with Arabic word 'tafsir'. While in Islam supposedly part of information on prophetic life (hadith) was transmitted by his contemporary women companions, taking egalitarian claims of Islam into account technically women have had equal rights in interpretation still apart from some exceptions in premodern era patriarchal male dominance in interpretations of Islam prevailed to most extent. According to Shemeem Burney Abbas many hadiths (prophetic life stories) were evolved and many fabricated after death of Islamic prophet, for some it was just recreational activity of creating and sharing stories for public consumption, for some it was essential vacuum filling, more over for those vested interests struggling and relating in fiercely competitive power dynamics drafting and exploiting interpretation to their own advantage were political exigencies for claiming their own legitimacy in power struggle of respective medieval times https://books.google.com/books?id=4YpdAAAAQBAJ&lpg;=PA49&vq;=Hadith&pg;=PA29#v=onepage&q;=Hadith&f;=true Abbas, Shemeem Burney. Pakistan‚Äôs Blasphemy Laws:From Islamic Empires to the Taliban. Spain, University of Texas Press, 2013. Pages 47 to 50 According to Abbas the patriarchal way of interpretations are not only used to sideline women from political competition but also exploit their immense resources and potential to advantage of hierarchical structures benefiting men in power by relegating women to subordinate roles. According to Margheriata Picchi marginalization of women in interpreting Islam resulted in patriarchal commentaries mandating hierarchical gender roles claiming superiority of men over women to hold authority over them. According to Picchi, in context of emerging of feminist views by end of 19th century and early 20th century tafsirs i.e. interpretations from Muslim women started coming. As per Picchi in context of Muslim women when first wave of feminism came, secular as well as religiously more inclined, both groups of women began using religious arguments to propagate their claims, but access to modernist religious education of first generation of muslim feminist women was limited and they had to largely rely on arguments forwarded by scholarly modernist men. For that reason, except few exception systematic rereading of Islamic texts was still missing in efforts of first batch of equality seeking Muslim women. Effective gender egalitarian feminist Hermeneutics of Quranic literature started coming on literary horizons by last quarter of 20th century and started becoming noticeable by 1990s across global Muslim corners. This process of Muslim feminist literary emancipation has been happening in considerable competition of revivalist Islamic tendencies, even some of women exegesis distancing themselves from feminist demands of equality sided with conservative views of accepting male dominance and patriarchal interpretations. Since patriarchal culture inherent in classical interpretation produces a gender-biased interpretation, When the idea of gender equality and justice is brought into the Quranic interpretation, for feminists, by the end of the 20th century, gender equality and justice became quite a lively issue. Islamic feminist intellectuals began questioning gender biases in the interpretation of the Quran. They study the Quran and interpret Quranic verses from a feminist perspective.Criticism of gender bias in the view of classical interpretations gave birth to the Feminist Hermeneutic method for the interpretation of the Quran.  Prominent Islamic feminists  Picchi informs that, Bauer 2015 and Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures(Suad, et al. 2003‚Äì2007) includes several entries on women in conservative and feminist tafsir. For a basic orientation of first time readers of gender relations in the sacred texts of Islam Awde 2000 is better primar. . Cooke 2001 encapsulates one of the early accounts of emerging Islamic feminism. Badran 2009 covers further matured levels of the field of Islamic feminism. Journal Hawwa published by Brill since 2003 has covered many a Muslim feminist articles. Kynsilehto 2008 includes effective capture of the debates surrounding the term and concepts of ‚ÄúIslamic feminism‚Äù.Hidayatullah 2014 provides an excellent overview of Islamic feminist authorship in the west. Islamic feminist figures who introduce feminist-based hermeneutics of the Qur'an can be categorized into two generations.Hidayatullah pp. 65-100. The first generation is Riffat Hassan, Azizah Al-Hibri and Amina Wadud. The second generation is, Asma Barlas, Sadiyya Shaikh and Kecia Ali. The first generation has contributed to the rise of feminist-based Qur'anic interpretations. This generation works as \\"Trailblazers\\", because in producing their work they are under tremendous pressure, experiencing male domination. Their work is nuanced against the patriarchal system with a hard and many personal experiences that show that they are oppressed. This generation is focused on their respective works, there is no quotation quoting and discussing the themes they discuss and there is no mutual support for the views expressed. The second generation emerged in 1990, triggered by an increase in the movement of women in the fight for women's human rights internationally, such as the World Women's Conference in Beijing in 1995 which gave birth to a commitment to build people through gender equality and the CEDAW (Convention on the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women) which gave birth to a commitment to eliminate discrimination against second generation thought is more moderate against the patriarchal system and they are mutually supportive and interrelated.  Hermeneutics of Islamic Feminism  Hermeneutics is more than interpretive principles or methods we resort to when immediate comprehension fails. Rather, hermeneutics is the art of understanding and of making oneself understood. The way this method works, uses methodological steps and principles of modern hermeneutics theory. Hermeneutics of Feminism is relatively newer. The use of hermeneutics for the interpretation of the Quran is still debated. Some refused and others supported. Contemporary Islamic scholars, encouraged by the awareness of the present reality and to meet scientific standards support the use of hermeneutics as a method of interpreting the Quran.Irsyadunas p. 3. Islamic feminist figures who developed their thoughts on the Quranic interpretation methodology, including Aminah Wadud, Musdah Mulia, Aysha A. Hidayatullah and Kecia Ali. Amina Wadud, through her Qur'an and Women, Rereading the Sacred Text from a Woman's Perspective, developed her thoughts on the methodology of Quranic interpretation. Wadud referred to contemporary Islamic thought, Fazlur Rahman, to dismantle the gender biases that colored the Quranic interpretation tradition so far. He dissected certain verses and keywords in the Quran that limited the role of women both individually and socially. When finding several aspects of gender equality and justice in the Quran, Wadud reinterpreted gender verses in the Quran from a women's perspective without the stereotype created by the male interpretation framework. Wadud initiated feminist-based hermeneutics, a method of interpreting the Quran that refers to the idea of gender equality and justice and rejects the patriarchal system. Wadud criticized the classical interpretation, both the method, perspective and contents. Then it offers a holistic interpretation of the Quran that considers all methods of interpretation of various social, political, cultural, moral and religious, life issues and women and solves problems comprehensively.

Aysha A. Hidayatullah Islamic feminist figure who developed his thoughts on the methodology of interpretation through his work Feminist Edges of the Qur'an (2014). This Assistant Professor of the University of San Francisco presents a comprehensive analysis of contemporary feminist interpretations of the Quran. She combines feminist-based interpretation of the Quran from feminist figures and provides an important introduction to the field of feminist-based interpretation of the Quran. Aysha conducted an in-depth investigation and radical criticism of feminist-based Quranic interpretation methods and approaches. Aysha put forward three feminist-based Quranic interpretation methods namely:Hidayatullah p. 501. the method of historical contextualization, intratextuality and the paradigm of monotheism. The historical contextualization method is to interpret the Quran by paying attention to the context of time and the background of the verse or revelation (asbab al-nuzul). With this method distinguished particular and universal verses. The particular verses are applied to define the situation and condition of 7th Century Arab society and universal verses for all humans. Historical contextual methods place the role of history in giving birth to gender biases and biological essentialism in classical interpretations. The intratextual reading method treats the Quran holistically, which is to track how linguistic forms are used throughout the Quranic text and compare one verse with another on the same theme. How to read the Quran with the intratextual method, which is not reading the verses one by one, but reading the verses in the same theme as a whole by referring to the Quranic principle of justice for all humans. Monotheism paradigm is related to the main concept of Islam, namely monotheism. Monotheism paradigm means the oneness of Allah and Allah cannot be divided and compared. In the monotheism paradigm that distinguishes gender (sexism) can be considered idolatrous, because all humans are caliphs on earth. If a woman is said to have an imperfect capacity, then this is clearly a mistake in understanding God's intention about humans as caliphs on earth. If women are seen as imperfect, women cannot fulfill their role as guardians of God. Thus the monotheism paradigm is the basis of gender equality and justice. The Islamic feminist figure from Indonesia who developed his thoughts on the interpretation methodology is Musdah Mulia through his work Indahnya Islam Menyuarakan kesetaraan dan Kedilan gender (2014). The Professor UIN Syarif Hidayatulah Jakarta is known as a persistent and consistent champion of gender equality and justice. In Indonesia,Mulia. with regard to gender in religious life, the challenges are severe and the sensitivity is high. Musdah sued gender bias in interpretation of the Quran and brought in the idea of gender equality and justice in interpretation. Musdah has long been aware that women are confined in theological prisons, due to gender biases in the interpretation of the Quran. Departing from the belief that human males and females are both khalifah fil ardh, Musdah interpreted the feminist-based Quran and produced feminist interpretations, including interpreting polygamy verses and reinterpreting the concept of nushuz in the Quranic verses. According to Musdah, polygamy denies women's humanity. The interpretation of the concept of nushuz is that the Quran commands only obey Allah and respect for husbands. Kecia Ali, Professor of the Department of Religion at Boston University has written various books on gender in Islam that focus on Islamic law about women. Through his work Sexsual Ethics & Islam: Reflections on the Feminist Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence (2012), Kecia Ali discusses sexual violence against women and shows a collision between morals and law.Ali. He is of the view that the verses of the Quran are interpreted by demeaning women, so it needs feminist reflection on the Quran and Hadith. Kecia Ali conducted a feminist reflection on the Quran and hadith and Islamic law, especially regarding marriage and sex and the problem of slavery in Islam. In the matter of marriage, Kecia Ali discussed dowry, divorce and misogyny toward women. According to Kecia Ali, a progressive approach to the Quranic text cannot be limited to the selective presentation of egalitarian verses in isolation from the context of the vast holy book. Such an approach would be futile, because the argument for gender equality is built by interpreting verses that are selective. He offers a method of jurisprudence, because legal experts will relate to the source of the text in a social context. The established law has the objective of interpretive action. According to Kecia Ali, understanding of the Quranic text must change every time according to social change.  Hermeneutical Islamic feminist works  *Amina Wadud her work Qur'an and Women, Rereading the Sacred Text from a Woman's Perspective dan Inside The Gender Jihad, Woman's Reform in Islam. .This Islamic feminist figure and gender fighter from the United States developed his thoughts on the methodology of Quranic interpretation, he referred to contemporary Islamic thought, such as Fazlur Rahman. Wadud dismantled the gender bias that colors the Quranic interpretation tradition so far. He dissected certain verses and keywords in the Quran that limited the role of women both individually and socially. When finding several aspects of gender equality and justice in the Quran, Wadud reinterpreted gender verses in the Quran from a women's perspective without the stereotype created by the male interpretation framework. Wadud initiated feminist-based hermeneutics, a method of interpreting the Quran that refers to the idea of gender equality and justice and rejects the patriarchal system. Wadud criticizes classical interpretations, both methods, perspective and contents. Then offer a holistic interpretation of the Quran that considers all methods of interpretation of the various problems of social, political, cultural, moral and religious life and women and solve problems comprehensively. Wadud shows the theoretical and methodological links between the interpretation of the Quran and the things that gave rise to it (who and how). Some of the focus of concentration, namely what the Quran says, how the Quran says it, what is said against the Quran and who says it.

Barlas came from Pakistan and became the first woman in Pakistan during Ziaul Haq who worked for foreign service (1976). In looking at how Islam talks about women, Barlas uses two important arguments: historical arguments and hermeneutic arguments. What is meant by historical argument is the expression of the textual and sexual political character that develops among Islamic societies, especially the process that has produced interpretations in Islam that have a patriarchal tendency. While the hermeneutic argument is intended to find what he calls the epistemology of egalitarianism and antipatriarchi in the Quran. Barlas explains the character of the policemic text of the Quran and opens up various possibilities of meaning, as a criticism of a reductionist interpretation pattern in a patriarchal framework. Asma Barlas gave rise to a new epistemology by applying the principles of feminist-based hermeneutics in the interpretation of Quranic verses. * Kecia Ali, her work Sexual Etics & Islam: Feminist Reflectionson Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence (2012).

Indonesian University Library Hermeneutics of Feminism offered by Mardety is Quranic hermeneutics. Contemporary Islamic figures, such as Hasan Hanafi, Fazlur Rahman, Muhammad Arkoun, first introduced the Quranic hermeneutics, and offered various hermeneutics that favor social justice, but there is no hermeneutic method that favors gender justice. Then, feminist-based hermeneutics of the Quran emerged and sided with gender justice. Hermeneutics Feminism is compiled by formulating the thoughts of Islamic feminist figures who conduct studies on feminist-based hermeneutics of the Quran. Departing from gender bias in the classical interpretation of the Quran which makes women theological prisoners, then to free women need to reinterpret verses of the Quran. Gender bias is caused by methodological problems, for this reason Hermeneutics of Feminism is offered to the Quran.HERMENEUTICS OF FEMINISM TOWARDS THE GENDER TOWARDS THE QUALITY OF THE QURISM A philosophical reflection on Aminah Wadud's thoughts HermeneutikaFeminisme.com accessed June 20, 2020 her book entitled Hermeneutika Feminisme Reformasi Gender dalam Islam was presented in May 2019 at the Anniversary of the Faculty of Philosophy at the University of Indonesia at Cemara 6, Central Jakarta.

The classical interpretation method contains inequality of meaning and describes unfair gender relations. This is where Hermeneutics Feminism as an alternative method of interpretation of the Quran can be offered. Hermeneutics Feminism is composed by formulating the thoughts of Islamic feminist figures regarding the methodology of Quranic interpretation.Mardinsyah p. 8. The formulation of the Hermeneutic modle of Feminism can be explained in 5 schemes viz:Mardinsyah pp. 94-106. First, based on the experiences / views (perspectives) of women. The experience / views of women in the interpretation of the Quran is one important thing. If the Quran is interpreted based on men's experience, then men's perceptions influence the position of interpretation of women. Second, framed the theory of feminism. The theories of feminism which are centered on the idea of equality and gender justice become a framework for building hermeneutics of feminism. If critical hermeneutics is framed by critical theory, then Hermeneutics of Feminism is framed by feminism theory. Third uses the historical contextualization method. Historical contextualization method, namely paying attention to the context of time and the background of the verse or revelation (asbab al-nuzul). This method aims to differentiate particular verses, namely verses to define the situation and condition of 7th Century Arab society and universal verses, namely verses for all humans. Fourth, use the intratextuality method. The application of the intratextuality method, is intended to develop a framework based on systematic thinking to correlate several verses that discuss the same theme so that it appears to be related in accordance with the verses of the Quran, rather than applying a single meaning to one verse. Fifth, the monotheistic paradigm. To get a fair interpretation of women, we must return to the core teachings of the Quran, monotheism as a paradigm of interpretation of the Quran. The concept of monotheism recognizes the unity of God, His uniqueness and indivisibility. Tauhid is a key method in hermeneutic of feminism for the interpretation of the Quran and is a doctrine of God's incomparable unity. With the monotheism paradigm will be seen clearly, the difference in the Quran with its interpretation  Understanding, addressing and adjusting Criticism  Aysha Hidaytullah through her hermeneutics in Feminist Edges of the Qur'an not only addresses criticism coming from conservative circles but also attempts honest peer review of Islamic Feminists. Sadaf jaffer in her research article points out 'Pakistani Atheist and Agnostic women' are very clear in their (online) autobiographies that, they appeal to alternative sources of ethical values based on humanism and constraining in 'Islamic' is fundamentally flawed in its assumptions and projection of identities.

Ugo Giletta (born 1957, San Firmino di Revello) is an Italian artist.  Career  Giletta's exhibition activity began in the early 1980s with solo exhibitions: Cavassa '87 (1987, Civic Museum of Casa Cavassa, Saluzzo), Il colore della forma (1989, Quadreria d‚Äôarte, Cuneo). Starting from the 1990s, Giletta appeared at institutional exhibitions in various locations in Piedmont and beyond: Tempo d‚Äôarte (1991, Torino Esposizioni, Turin), Intermedia (1992, Crawford Gallery of Cork, Ireland), Fantastica automazione (1993, Fondazione Marazza, Borgomanero), Proposte IX (1993, Palazzo IRV, Piedmont Region, Turin), Traiettorie sonore (1995, Villa Olmo, Como), From 200 to 2000 (1995, Palazzo Dugentesco, Vercelli). In 1999, with the writer Nico Orengo, he produced the multimedia show The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy, freely adapted from the book of the same name by Tim Burton, presented at the Doge‚Äôs Palace ([Ducale]) in Genoa; his collaboration with poets and writers also includes the creation of some art books for Edizioni Pulcinoelefante, especially with Orengo and the poet Alda Merini. Since 2000, Giletta has exhibited his works nationally and internationally in art galleries, institutions and museums in Italy, France, Belgium, Hungary, Austria, Germany, South Korea, China and Singapore. In 2003 he was a finalist at the Mastroianni International Award. He took part in other exhibitions, among which, in 2016, the Challenging Beauty Insights of Italian Contemporary Art at the Parkview Green Museum, Beijing, an exhibition illustrating the contemporary scene of Italian art from the 1960s to the present day, from Poor Art to Transavantgarde, from the New Roman School to the generations of artists of the Nineties and Zero‚Äôs. MOVING TALES Racconti in movimento (Cuneo Civic Museum), an international selection of 30 video works from La Gaia Collection of Cuneo.  Artistic activity  Ugo Giletta's artistic career has been characterized by the use of various techniques including painting, drawing, sculpture and video installations. As Francesco Poli writes: \\"All his work, although diversified, merges into a poetic underlying restlessness that deals with the enigma of existence.‚Äù The painting is realized with watercolor on paper and canvas of various sizes, while all the drawings are created in pastel. Ugo Giletta works almost exclusively with the human face, as Guido Curto noted, \\"... facial features lack a precise connotation, they are portraits that do not depict anyone, but represent only the fluid identity of our Western mass globalized society.\\" Lea Mattarella describes these works as figures that outline lonely and isolated heads and faces in an indefinite emptiness that cannot be easily contextualized. Historian and art critic L√≥r√°nd Hegyi sums it up: \\"These are figurations that are simply present, in their objectivity, without the need for explanations as to whom they belong or where they come from. The fascinating journey exactly means delving into their uniqueness\\" When Giletta uses the video in his installations, as well as in his sculptures, the figures are considered by critics as sad beings, painfully lost, forgotten, ruined. Giovanni Tesio writes in this regard: \\"... imprisoned inside a wholly inner language, they come from the emptiness and aspire to a shared silence.\\" To emphasize the poetics of the artist‚Äôs entire work, L√≥r√°nd Hegyi adds: \\"... for this reason we can‚Äôt look at them without compassion, without empathy, since, in their essence, the slow process of disappearance, the unstoppable process of loss, acquires a poetically powerful form.\\"  Exhibitions  * Il volto dell‚Äôaltro (2019 Ex Chiesa di San Paolo, Cattaro (Kotor), Republic of Montenegro * Dentro il disegno/Inside the Drawing (2019 La Castiglia Saluzzo - Italy) * Intriguing uncertainties (2019 Parkview Museum, Beijing - China) * AD ACQUA (2018/2019 Pinacoteca Accademia Albertina, Torino - Italy) * ART AND MISSION: George Wong 1952-2017 (2018/2019 Parkview Museum, Beijing - China) * Uncertainties / Improbabilities (Sep 7th ‚Äì Oct 27th 2018 Hopstreet Gallery, Brussels - Belgium) * \\"VIENNALINE\\" curated_by (Sep 14th ‚Äì Oct 13th 2018 Galerie Mario Mauroner, Vienna - Austria) * VOLTO: (09.06.-19.07.2018 Galerie Martin Mertens, Berlin - Germany) * The Artist's Voice (2018 Parkview Museum, Beijing - China) * The Artist's Voice (2017, Parkview Museum, Singapore) * Le spine della complessit√†.

On returning to Germany in 1930 or 1931 he became a leading member of the paramilitary \\"Red Front-Fighters\\" (\\"Roter Frontk√§mpferbund\\" / RFB) in the politically volatile Hamburg region. In 1932 he was involved in the Altona Bloody Sunday street battle and, following the National Socialist power grab at the start of 1933, he became a victim of \\"Nazi justice\\". On 1 August 1933 August L√ºtgens was executed: four men were convicted and executed at the same time, but L√ºtgens was identified at the time as the leading figure among them, and of the four cases, it is the one involving L√ºtgens that has received the most coverage subsequently. As one of the first and most highly publicised government opponents to be executed after the rapid switch to dictatorship in 1933, August L√ºtgens was soon being celebrated by government opponents as \\"one of the first victims of fascist justice to be killed\\". His fame was further enhanced after 1945. Particularly in the Soviet occupation zone (relaunched in October 1949 as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic / East Germany), he was celebrated as an antifascist hero. A naval academy was even named in his honour. L√ºtgens had been convicted in 1933 by a \\"special court\\", and in 1945 a campaign was launched in Hamburg to expose unsatisfactory aspects of his trial and secure rehabilitation for L√ºtgens and the three men executed with him. In 1992 the Hamburg district court reversed all four of the earlier judgements, citing \\"manipulations of justice\\" (\\"Justizmanipulationen\\").  Biography = Provenance and early years  August L√ºtgens was born into a working class Social Democratic family in L√ºbeck where he grew up, the eldest of his parents' twelve children. His father was employed as an unskilled industrial metal worker. In order to feed the family it was necessary that his mother should also earn a wage: she worked as a washerwoman. Between 1903 and 1911 the boy attended school in the city. Since both parents worked long hours, for most of the time the children were left to their own devices. As the eldest of them, on returning from school at the start of each afternoon, August L√ºtgens found himself, in the words of one source, acting as the \\"household maid\\", looking after the other eleven children, heating up the left-overs for lunch, and preparing the family's evening meal. As his sisters grew older they were able to take over the domestic duties, however, and August took a job as an errand boy, working for a pharmacist. In the evenings he distributed the newspaper of the Metal Workers' Union.  At sea  In 1911 L√ºtgens left school and went to sea as a \\"ship's boy\\", spending the next few years as a sailor. He had no trouble finding work, initially working on ships sailing from Hamburg or Bremen, and later also working on Danish and English ships. When he was 16 he joined the union (\\"Seeleutegewerkschaft\\"). Soon after that he followed in his father's footsteps by joining the German Social Democratic Party (SPD). The timing of the outbreak of the First World War at the end of July 1914 caught him off-guard. He was in a foreign port at the time. Keen to avoid internment (as a foreigner) he and a comrade grabbed a rowing boat and made for the open sea. They were fished out of the water onto a German patrol boat. Instead of being taken to shore August L√ºtgens was informed that he had been conscripted for service in the Imperial Navy.  War years  A willingness to share his political views with fellow seamen could make him a disruptive crew member. \\"That is a lie and defamatory\\", he wrote in red ink across a propaganda poster showing a German nurse from a hospital ship being variously tortured by two English sailors. This earned him a disciplinary hearing before a military tribunal. Later, while serving on the warship SMS Westfalen, he organised a clandestine anti-war group, but someone betrayed him to the officers. Group members showed solidarity in refusing to provide investigators with large amounts of incriminating information. He nevertheless faced a second trial, seemingly more serious than the first, before a military tribunal at some stage around 1916/17, and was determined to be \\"unreliable\\". After serving a brief jail term he was sent to Flanders from where, it was evidently hoped by the prosecuting authorities, he would not return. He spent time fighting alongside others in the \\"First Sailors' Regiment\\" on the \\"Western front\\". However, by the time war ended in 1918 August L√ºtgens was back with high-seas fleet in Wilhelmshaven. He joined the anti-war Spartacus League as the war ground to a conclusion in 1918, and when the league became a founding pillar (along with the now fragmenting \\"Independent Social Democratic Party\\") of the Communist Party at the start of 1919, L√ºtgens evidently became a communist, though sources are unclear as to when he actually joined the party.  Revolution  The succession of major, if mainly localised, uprisings that came to be chronicled as Germany's \\"November revolution\\" had their origins with naval mutinies in Wilhelmshaven and Kiel, which then spread inland with the demoralised soldiers coming home from the western (and other) front(s), especially to towns and cities in Germany's industrial heartlands. L√ºtgens was among the leaders on the rebel side. Fighting in Wilhelmshaven persisted, and in January 1919 a group of naval officers and \\"professional soldiers\\" launched an organised counter-attack, targeting \\"communists\\", after which striking shipyard workers returned to work: in the \\"quasi-military\\" terms in which observers were inclined to assess the situation at the time, L√ºtgens was on the losing side. In May 1919 he was sentenced to an \\"exemplary\\" twelve year jail term for his part in the uprising. During his trial L√ºtgens found himself on the receiving end of hostile publicity after a bank employee testified at his trial that he had been involved in the theft of 300,000 marks that had been set aside to be sent to Soviet Russia. The truth of the matter is impossible to determine: nor is it clear whether the court took the evidence of the bank employee seriously. Nevertheless, the hostile mainstream newspapers of the political centre and right made much of the bank clerk's allegations, branding L√ºtgens a bandit and a robber. For better and worse, he was now a man with a media profile. Following sentencing he was transferred to the main jail in Bremen. A few months later, however, the wardens making their rounds at the start of the day found that cell 138, which had been assigned to L√ºtgens, was empty. Nothing was broken: there was no sign of a struggle, the bars in the window were sound and even the door was securely locked. It was only some time later than someone noticed that the uniform - including the cap - of a prison guard were missing. August L√ºtgens had left the prison unimpeded, having taken the precaution of dressing himself as a prison guard. Sources mention but do not identify the comrades who had helped him. The escapee faced another trial, which this time he did not attend, and was sentenced to an additional three year jail term. By this time he was in Denmark, however. Over the next few months he worked on the ships on the \\"North Sea\\" (identified on English maps as the \\"Baltic Sea\\"), returning at one point during 1920 to Germany, but it seemed unwise to stay for very long. Instead he made his was to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg had been rebranded in 1914) where he applied successfully for political exile, and settled down for ten years.  Lisa  In Petrograd he befriended Lisa Fiedler, one of five children of a Hamburg family who had relocated a few years earlier in response to an appeal from the recently installed Soviet government for skilled workers. August L√ºtgens married Lisa Fiedler in 1922. Their son Franz was born in the same year. Their daughter, Elsa, followed in 1925. At some point they moved to the central Moscow district of Zamoskvoretskaya (–ó–∞–º–æ—Å–∫–≤–æ—Ä–µ—Ü–∫–∞—è) where August L√ºtgens obtained factory work. He later trained and qualified for work as a sea captain, and returned to work at sea.  Return to Germany  Sources are a little ambivalent about the reasons for and timing of August L√ºtgens' return to Germany. In the long aftermath of the Great depression unemployment levels were desperately high. Politics were becoming increasingly polarised and spilling onto the streets, as desperate voters turned to the Communist Party and / or the populist National Socialist Party. After the 1930 election (and even more after the elections in 1932) political polarisation was reflected in the parliamentary deadlock which would open the way for the Hitler government to take power in January 1933. The more heroic explanation for the return of August L√ºtgens is that, from Moscow, he became aware of the desperate condition of the German working class and knew it was his patriotic duty to return to Germany and help. An alternative or complementary explanation is based on the fact that the Br√ºning government in Germany, desperate to take some of the heat out of the political situation, implemented a political amnesty, as a result of which L√ºtgens calculated that if he returned to Germany he was no longer likely to be sent back to prison for his involvement in the so-called \\"November revolution\\" of 1918/19. It is not impossible that personal considerations also played their part: he arrived in 1930 or 1931 without fanfare, while Lisa L√ºtgens remained in the Zamoskvoretskaya apartment that she had hitherto shared with her husband and children. The children were still with her: at some point her mother had also moved in. He made his way via Leningrad (as Petrograd had been renamed in 1924) and Stettin to L√ºbeck where he had grown up. He quickly moved on to the nearby port city of Hamburg, and from there to Altona. In 1938 Altona was subsumed into the expanded Hamburg conurbation, but in the early 1930s it was still a determinedly separate municipality, with an important commercial and manufacturing sector and a large politically engaged working class. It was precisely the sort of expanding and vibrant place that the populists sought to politicise in support of their political agenda: but by 1930 people were speaking of \\"Red Altona\\". In the battle for hearts and minds National Socialism had lost out to Communism. At some point the populists evidently gave up on the hearts and minds and decided, instead, that Altona must be brought round to their way of thinking through a strategy based on terror. It was here that August L√ºtgens settled in the commercial heart of the town, close to the fish market. Like millions of others in Germany at this time, he was unemployed and living on welfare.  Political paramilitary  In Altona he joined the \\"Association of Red Front-Fighters\\" (\\"Roter Frontk√§mpferbund\\" / RFB), a paramilitary organisation with close links to the Communist Party and branch operations across the country. It had been founded in 1925 and, in response to intensified street fighting, banned by the government in 1929. Its emergence was seen by members and supporters as a defensive reaction to the various paramilitary right-wing groupings that had been a feature of the German political scene since the end of the war. By 1930 the enemy had become the populist paramilitaries underpinning the seemingly unstoppable rise of Adolf Hitler. L√ºtgens quickly became a leading figure in the Altona RFB, organising protection for the homes of workers in the \\"red districts\\" of town, which by now were increasingly being subjected to \\"Nazi street terror\\".  Altona Bloody Sunday  Altona Bloody Sunday was the name given to a violent battle that took place on the streets of Altona on 17 July 1932. It was a fight involving National Socialist paramilitaries, Communist paramilitaries and the police. It took place two and a half weeks after the government had lifted a ban on National Socialist paramilitaries. An estimated 5,000 -7,000 National Socialist supporters arrived in Altona - according to some sources travelling under police protection - from all over Germany, and confronted a large number of communist supporting Altona residents, possibly including August L√ºtgens. Accounts of what happened on Altona Bloody Sunday very widely, depending on the perspective of the writer, but there seems to be a consensus that the even left 18 people dead and at least seventy more badly injured. A wave of arrests followed. However, it was only on 25 August 1932, slightly more than a month after the battle, that August L√ºtgens was arrested at his girlfriend's apartment in the centre of Hamburg, and detained.  An inconclusive trial  He was held in custody pending trial. That took place in February 1933 a week or so after the Hitler government took power. The prosecution had difficulty in finding evidence of any crime committed by L√ºtgens. In the end, however, according to at least one source they settled on a charge that he had been distributing banned [political] leaflets. On 22 February 1933 the trial was suspended after the court determined that there was no convincing evidence against the accused. L√ºtgens remained in custody, however, while the authorities considered their next move.  Dealing with communists  On the night of 27 February 1933 Reichstag building in Berlin suffered a destructive arson attack. The alacrity with which the government responded has been taken by subsequent historians as an indication that they had somehow known in advance that the arson attack would take place. The Reichstag Fire Decree, suspending a range of basic civil liberties, was issued on 28 February 1933. The government let it be known that \\"communists\\" had been responsible for the attack, and a wave of arrests of known Communist Party leaders and activists rapidly ensued. As the trial of August L√ºtgens the previous week had demonstrated, the government still could not rely on the German courts to produce the right verdict when those arrested communists faced trial. The solution that presented itself was the revival of \\"special courts\\". By the end of March 1933 a network of special courts, specially designed to deal with political trials, was in place across Germany. As well as dealing with individuals arrested in the aftermath of the Reichstag fire, preparations were made to use the special court for various other self- evidently political trials that had not yet, from the government perspective, been satisfactorily concluded. The case of August L√ºtgens was one of these.  Justice under National Socialism  On 8 May 1933 a mass-trial of 22 \\"revolutionary workers\\" opened before a session of the special court in Altona. Although it was not formally a murder trial, it was understood that the hearing proceeded from the fact that two of the eighteen people killed during the \\"Bloody Sunday\\" fighting had been Sturmabteilung (SA) paramilitaries, shot dead, according to a communist source, by fellow National Socialist fighters or, perhaps, by policemen attending the incident on the instructions of Mayor Otto Eggerstedt. (Otto Eggerstedt, as a member of the Social Democratic Party, was himself arrested on 27 May 1933, a week before the conclusion of the trial, on suspicion of having breached of the government's new Press Law.) It was alleged in court that a member of the security services had found a hand-drafted sketch at August L√ºtgens' apartment of a section of the street outside the house in Altona where L√ºtgens was living at the time with his girlfriend. The sketch was presented as evidence that L√ºtgens had been the individual principally responsible for organising a sniper attack during the \\"Bloody Sunday\\" fighting on the streets of Altona. However, the court was unable to clarify either where L√ºtgens had been during the afternoon in question nor even, indeed, whether he had participated directly in the street fighting at all. It subsequently emerged that the sketch presented in evidence had been a falsification by the authorities, hastily pushed in with a pile of papers that had indeed been seized from the apartment, in order to provide evidence for L√ºtgens illegal activities with the RFB. The trial before the Special Court in Altona concluded on 2 June 1933. Four of the accused were sentenced to death. The four were August L√ºtgens, Bruno Tesch, Karl Wolff and Walter M√∂ller. Bizarrely, in view of the death sentence handed out, the court judgment itself included a statement in respect of L√ºtgens, who was presented as the most significant of the four, \\"It is not proven that the accused L√ºtgens himself took part in the violence against the SA contingent on the afternoon of 17 July 1932\\". In a well- publicised show described by one critical source as \\"medieval\\", the four men were executed by decapitation in the inner yard of the jail at the court complex (since 1975 known as the \\"Max-Brauer-Allee court complex\\") in Altona on 1 August 1933. The executioner used a hatchet (\\"Handbeil\\"). The authorities arranged for 75 political prisoners to be assembled in the court yard in order to watch the executions. The youngest of the four, Bruno Tesch was just 20. The novelist Arnold Zweig used the story of August L√ºtgens' final months as the backdrop for his 1947 novel Das Beil von Wandsbek (\\"The hatchet of Wandsbek\\"). The book provided the basis for a film in 1952 and another in 1981. It was widely distributed and well known in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) but remained almost entirely unknown in the German Federal Republic (West Germany). It never purported to be other than a novel, but the narrative nevertheless drew much of its power from true facts incorporated and referenced in it. It became part of the wider process whereby during the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s August L√ºtgens became a hero of Communist propaganda and iconography. This ensured that L√ºtgens became well-known to generations of German antifascists, but it also caused am conflation of truth and fiction worthy of Hollywood: this has sometimes proven hard to disentangled in popular consciousness.  Campaign for rehabilitation  In the end it took slightly more than sixty years before friends, relatives, international justice activists and other campaigners secured from a Hamburg court posthumous rehabilitation for August L√ºtgens, and the three others executed with him at the Altona court complex on 1 August 1933. After 1945 there had been at least 14 occasions on which applications to have the 1933 Altona Bloody Sunday verdict lifted or reversed were simply ignored or rejected by the Hamburg prosecutor's office, thereby implicitly endorsing the constitutional legality of the National Socialist's \\"special court\\". In the end it was only the publicity given to the affair following meticulous research undertaken by the French author and former R√©sistance fighter, L√©on Schirmann that forced Hamburg justice officials to take the rehabilitation campaign seriously. After decades of procrastination, and following yet another application, a retrial was ordered on the sixtieth anniversary of Altona Bloody Sunday. In November 1992 a criminal division of the Hamburg district court decided to overturn earlier judgments and acquit L√ºtgens, Tesch, M√∂ller and Wolff on grounds of \\"proven manipulations of justice\\".  Celebration  The bodies of the four executed men - many sources identify them as victims not of execution but of murder - were quietly transported to Berlin and there cremated. Not till 1935 did the authorities secretly bury the urns containing their ashes in a corner of Berlin's Marzahn Park Cemetery. After the war had ended these remains were sent back to Hamburg and in 1947 reburied in the vast Ohlsdorf Cemetery in the special section set aside for antifascist resistance fighters. The small \\"pillow-stone\\" commemorating August L√ºtgens is positioned eleven places along from the left in the fourth row of the collected memorial stones. More recently four commemorative \\"Stolpersteine\\" have been arranged in a square formation on the pavement outside the court house in which L√ºtgens and his three comrades were sentenced to death. The parkland surrounding the former Altona Hospital (\\"Alte Krankenh√§user Altona\\") has been renamed \\"August-L√ºtgens-Park\\" in commemoration and celebration. The park is one of several public amenities carrying the name of August L√ºtgens. The port city of Rostock, which was part of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) between 1949 and 1989/90 also paid special tribute to August L√ºtgens. The government controlled training and education facility of the Deutsche Seereederei, the organisation responsible for all the East German shipping involved in foreign trade since 1952, changed its name to GST-Marineschule ‚ÄûAugust L√ºtgens‚Äú in 1980, and a memorial tablet was placed in the inner courtyard of the training academy in Rostock's Krischanweg (street). The Rostock sculptor Wolfgang Eckardt created a medal showing his portrait. In 2001 an unknown attacker destroyed the memorial tablet in Rostock, but the cultural office of the city council has given repeat assurances that during the course of redevelopment along the Krischanweg the memorial will be appropriately restored, with a guarantee of public access.

Early life and education  Yury Skokov was born in Vladivostok, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union on June 20, 1938. His father was an NKVD officer. He graduated from the Leningrad Electrotechnical Institute in 1961 with a degree in radio engineering, Candidate of Sciences.  Career  From 1961 to 1969, Skokov was a researcher at Research Institute No. 2 of the Ministry of Defense of the Soviet Union in Kalinin. He then worked at the All-Union Research Institute of Current Sources of the Ministry of Electrotechnical Industry of the Soviet Union from 1969 to 1977. He then became the director of a manufacturing plant in Krasnodar and worked there until 1986. In 1986, he was appointed General Director of NPO Kvant, a company which manufactured autonomous energy. In 1988, he became one of the initiators of the creation of AMBI Bank (Joint-Stock Commercial Bank for Intersectoral Integration).  Political Career  He was elected a member of the Moscow City Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and served as a People's Deputy in the Congress of People's Deputies from 1989 to 1991. From 1990 to 1991, he was the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR.

In March 1993, he entered into an open conflict with the President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin, refusing to endorse the draft decree of Yeltsin on the introduction of a special procedure for governing the country. The decree included the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet of Russia, which was contrary to the 1978 Constitution of the RSFSR which was still in power. Due to the conflict, Skokov was removed from his post on May 10, 1993. From August to September of 1993, he participated in the creation of the \\"Consent for the Fatherland\\" committee, a centrist organization which wanted to peacefully resolve the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis.

There was also a deputy metropolitan bishop of Jerusalem from the mid-18th century to its abolition in 1858 who resided at the Monastery of Saint Ananias and was responsible for the collection of donations for the diocese. Church The first Jacobite church in Jerusalem was probably built between the Sasanian conquest (614) and the Islamic conquest (637). The Patriarch Michael the Syrian (died 1199) implies that the church torn down by Harun al-Rashid in 806/807 predated the Islamic conquest. It was soon rebuilt by an Egyptian named Macarius of Naburwah. Since almost all of the known bishops were monks, there must also have been at least a rudimentary monastic community. The church appears to have been destroyed at the time of the destruction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 1092, Mansur of Tilbana, another Egyptian, built what was then the only Syriac Orthodox church in the city. In the first quarter of the 12th century, Bishop Ignatius II rebuilt the destroyed church and monastery. It was dedicated to Saint Mary Magdalene and later also to Simon the Pharisee. Shortly after 1125, Ignatius III constructed a hostel with a courtyard across from the church. After the Ayyyubid conquest in 1187, the church and monastery were transformed into a Muslim school. The bishops were only able again to occupy it again briefly when the city was in Christian hands between the Sixth Crusade (1229) and the Khwarazmian conquest (1244). Thereafter the Syriac Orthodox used the small church of Saint Thomas of the Germans until it was handed over to the Muslim authorities by the incumbent monk, who converted to Islam in 1451/1452. The Syriac Orthodox patriarch acquired the Monastery of Saint Mark from the Coptic Orthodox in 1472 and this has served ever since as the church of the bishops of Jerusalem. List of bishops The Syriac Orthodox Register of Episcopal Ordinations only goes back to 793. Michael the Syrian appended to his Chronicle a list of bishops of Jerusalem from James, brother of Jesus, down to his own time. It is identical to the Register for the bishops after 793. The bishops were of metropolitan rank. In the following list, a date range like 792√ó818 means \\"ordained between 792 and 818\\". Bishops before 793 cannot be dated at all. The list begins with the first bishop elected in opposition to the Council of Chalcedon (451), but the numbering takes into account the earlier bishops of Jerusalem.List drawn from and . *Theodosius (451‚Äì453) *Severus (590‚Äì635) *Anastasius *Martyrius *Sallustianus *Elias *Cyril II *Jeremy I *Thomas I *John I *Philoxenus I *Timothy I (792√ó818) *Job (816√ó845) *Ignatius I (816√ó846) *Joseph III (816√ó846) *John II (845√ó875) *Cyril III Noah (845√ó875) *Cyriacus *Severus (877√ó884) *Joseph IV (909√ó924) *Theodore (909√ó924) *Cyril IV (922√ó936) *Jeremy II (935√ó954) *Thomas II (964√ó986) *John III (1006√ó1031) *Philoxenus II (1003√ó1031) *Zacharias (1041√ó1058) *Thomas III (1041√ó1058) *Timothy II (1062√ó1074) *John IV (1079√ó1083) *Cyril V (1090√ó1130) *David (1090√ó1130) *Ignatius II Hesnun (1090√ó1130, died 1124/1125) *Ignatius III ibn Busayr of Gadina (1123√ó1140) *Ignatius IV Romanus (1138√ó1167) *Athanasius (1167√ó1200) *Ignatius V Sahdo (1167√ó1200) *Basil (fl. 1292‚Äì1295) ... *Gregorius Joseph al- Gurji (c. 1510/1512‚Äì1537) *Gregorius Bahnam (c. 1530) *John of Mardin (d. 1577) *Gregorius, called John of Gargar (d. 1585√ó1587) *Gregorius Behnam of Arbo (1590‚Äì1614) *Gregorius Abdal Jaleel (1664‚Äì1681) *Gregorius Simon of Tur Abdin (1693‚Äì1719) *Gregorius Thomas (1737‚Äì1748) *Athanasius Jacob (1785‚Äì1797) * Cyril ‚ÄòAbd al-Ahad (1799‚Äì1840) *Gregorius Abded Sattuf (1872‚Äì1880) *George Kassab of Sadad (d. 1896) *Iyawannis Elias (1896‚Äì1908) *Athanasius Yeshue Samuel (1946‚Äì1957) *Dionysius Behnan Jijjawi (1957‚Äì1996) *Sewerus Malki Mourad (1996‚Äì2018) *Gabriel Dahho (2019‚Äì) References Notes Citations Bibliography   * * Category:Bishops in Jerusalem ","title":"Syriac Orthodox Bishop of Jerusalem"},{"id":"64204270","text":"Moral is a 1982 Filipino drama film directed by Marilou Diaz-Abaya and written by Ricky Lee. It is the second in a loose trilogy of feminist films directed by Diaz-Abaya and written by Lee which discuss women's issues, along with Brutal (1980) and Karnal (1983). Set in contemporary times in the Philippines, the film stars Lorna Tolentino, Gina Alajar, Sandy Andolong, and Anna Marin as a group of friends and follows the course of their lives over the course of several years after they graduate from college. A \\"loosely structured, observational drama\\", the film discusses several topics that Diaz-Abaya and Lee saw as taboo at the time, such as abortion, rape, and gender inequality in the context of the changing morals of the time. While it initially had an underwhelming reception from both critics and the general public upon its release, Moral has grown in stature over time and is now considered by some critics as one of Diaz-Abaya's best works. Both Diaz-Abaya and Lee consider the film one of the most personal of their many collaborations. It was restored by the ABS-CBN Film Restoration Project in 2017, premiered at that year's Cinema One Originals Film Festival, and was subsequently shown at several film festivals around the world. Plot Joey, Kathy, Sylvia, and Maritess are four students at the University of the Philippines Diliman. The film opens with the marriage of Maritess to Dodo, and follows the occasionally intersecting lives of the four friends. Maritess is initially content with simply being a housewife for Dodo. At the friends' graduation, Maritess goes into labor and gives birth to a baby boy. She experiences difficulties taking care of the baby, including quarreling with her mother-in-law, postpartum depression, and not having any more time for herself. Over time, she grows discontented with her marriage and lack of freedom and tells Maggie of her desire to leave Dodo. One day, Dodo rapes Maritess; she leaves him and temporarily lives with Sylvia. She eventually allows them to get back together on the condition that she is treated as an equal in the relationship. Joey is a drug user who regularly sleeps around with different men, and has a tense relationship with her mother Maggie. She is in love with activist Jerry and continually makes advances at him, which are rejected. She becomes pregnant, and asks for money from her friends and mother for an abortion. Before that can happen, she miscarries and is told by a doctor that she is incapable of having children. Jerry joins the rebellion in the mountains and asks Joey to let his wife Nita live with her. Nita stays with Joey and does housework for her, until she learns that Jerry has been killed. Nita tells Joey and then leaves to join the rebellion. Sylvia has separated from her husband Robert, whom she still has feelings for. She and Robert continue to spend time together as they share custody of their son, and Sylvia becomes friends with Robert's partner Celso. She meets Ernie, a fellow teacher at the school she works for, and the two begin a relationship together ‚Äî her first serious relationship since her marriage with Robert. One day, a woman shows up at her house and states that she is Ernie's wife, and that Ernie has another wife in the province whom he has abandoned. Sylvia breaks up with Ernie. Kathy is a mediocre singer aspiring to become a star. Her lesbian talent agent, JM, explains that her public image is more important than her singing ability; Kathy adopts a persona of a spiritual hippie in interviews, and provides sexual favors to JM to keep her as a client. She also sleeps with corporate executive Mr. Suarez, who promises that he can make her famous, but only for a short time. Kathy asks Sylvia to tell her if she honestly thinks she is a good singer. When she says no, Kathy stops recording her album and starts to sing only for fun and to improve her skills. The film ends with the four friends laughing with each other in a car on the way to drop off Joey at the airport for a vacation with Maggie.

The film is set in the Philippines in the late 1970s and early 1980s during the Martial Law era, described by Asian Cinevision as a \\"time of moral flux\\", noting that the film's characters \\"find themselves in situations when old values and principles no longer apply\\". Diaz-Abaya and Lee also decided to explore topics they deemed to be taboo at the time, such as homosexuality, marital rape, and the New People's Army, while eschewing traditional narrative structure and creating a film with \\"no plot\\", as described by Lee. He stated that the film contains no inciting incidents and has no story; Professor Rommel Rodriguez of the University of the Philippines Diliman noted that the film, as it simply portrayed the lives of its four main characters, did not have a clear beginning, middle, or end, leaving viewers without certainty as to the ultimate fates of the characters. Filmmaker and film historian Nick Deocampo noted that the major differences in the personalities of the four friends allowed the film to explore the different aspects of womanhood in the tumultuous 1970s. Lee deemed the script as one of his most personal, as he used stories and anecdotes from his real friendships as inspiration for the events in the film. Diaz-Abaya also considered Moral as one of her \\"most sentimentally important\\" films. Production Diaz-Abaya's 1980 film Brutal, which was also written by Lee and produced by Jesse Ejercito, was not only a critical success but also achieved box-office success at the Metro Manila Film Festival, grossing more than even Ang Panday (1980) featuring action star Fernando Poe Jr. Following that success, Ejercito aimed to produce another film with Diaz-Abaya starring the two main stars of Brutal: Gina Alajar and Amy Austria. Following infighting between Ejercito and Austria, Austria was removed from the project. At this point, Lee already had a finished script; its plot revolved around two singers, a talented one and an untalented one, as the less talented one found greater career success. Following the departure of Austria from the project, Diaz-Abaya and Lee decided to be more daring with the film and Lee rewrote the script to be about four friends, while retaining the original story of an untalented singer who found career success. Lee wrote the script for Moral simultaneously with the script for Ishmael Bernal's Himala, and both films competed at the 1982 Metro Manila Film Festival. Reception Moral was initially dismissed by most critics and the general public. Diaz-Abaya herself noted that she was \\"not surprised at all\\" at the lack of favorable audience reception to the film due to its unconventional structure. At the Metro Manila Film Festival, it was overshadowed by Himala, which won Best Picture. A few notable critics had positive opinions of Moral on its initial release: National Artist Bienvenido Lumbera, film scholar Joel David, and fellow directors Bernal and Eddie Romero. Additionally, Sandy Andolong won Best Supporting Actress at the 1982 FAMAS Awards for her performance, and Lee won Best Screenplay at the Metro Manila Film Festival. Over time, the film's popularity among critics increased, due in part to repeated cable showings and retrospectives of works written by Lee. By 1989, in a poll of critics and filmmakers commissioned by David to determine the greatest Filipino movies ever made, Moral ranked 12th. Additionally, in a 2019 poll commissioned by critic Skilty Labastilla of more than 100 fellow film critics and filmmakers on the best Filipino films directed by a woman, Moral ranked first. According to Lorna Tolentino, Moral helped change her image among critics as an actress who only appeared in \\"sexy movies\\", as it showcased her acting abilities. Restored and remastered version The ABS-CBN Film Restoration Project released a digitally restored and remastered version of Moral in 2017. Initially, the project deemed it impossible to restore as there was no surviving copy of the film negatives that had not been heavily damaged. The copy found at the film archives of the Cultural Center of the Philippines had been severely damaged by flooding and a lack of air conditioning at the storage facility. A restorable copy was subsequently sourced from the collection of the Film Development Council of the Philippines; it took nearly 2,600 restoration hours to restore by Italian company L‚ÄôImmagine Ritrovata. The restoration did not completely resolve the issues with the film, particularly regarding its color and sound, due to severe mold damage. The restored version premiered at the 2017 Cinema One Originals Film Festival's Restored Classics section. Sequel In 2003, a sequel to Moral was released titled Noon at Ngayon: Pagsasamang Kay Ganda. This film took place 20 years after the events of the original film, with only Laurice Guillen reprising her role as Joey's mother, Maggie.

It is a Carrara marble obelisk mounted on a granite foundation engraved with names of the city's soldiers who were killed during the American Civil War. It has been dismantled and is in the process of being re-erected in a location near Barber Creek. Description The monument is made up of two different sections, an obelisk made of Carrara marble that has six shafts, and a granite base. Only the marble obelisk is engraved. The names of white Confederate soldiers from Athens who were killed during the Civil War are inscribed on the marble. A veteran of the war called for the names to be arranged in alphabetical order rather than by rank so none of their deaths would be perceived as greater than the others, but his request was left unfulfilled. History The monument was one of the first monuments to the casualties of the American Civil War to be raised in the South after its conclusion. Construction of the monument began on May 5, 1871, and was completed on June 3, 1872, at the cost of $4,444.44 (about $933,000 in 2020) raised by the Ladies' Memorial Association from the residents of the city, though another professor at the university, Akela Reason, proposed that it was actually funded by the city's wealthy men because \\"it would have been easier for women to build a memorial mourning the dead than for men to build one in defiance.\\" It has been moved twice since it was first erected at the intersection of College Avenue and Washington Street. It was first moved north one block in the center of College Avenue, but was relocated again in 1912 when it caused congestion there. It then stood in the median of Broad Street until August 10, 2020. 2020 relocation Discussions by the city and local activists to remove the monument began after the Charleston church shooting in 2015. After the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police the area around the monument became the rally point for the city's protest. Protesters called for the monument to be removed. In response to the local outcry it is planned for the monument to be moved again from its current location in downtown Athens in 2020 by Athens mayor, Kelly Girtz. The mayor's desire to move the monument is challenged by Senate Bill 77, which prevents the city from moving Confederate monuments from prominent locations to another of lower prominence, but a loophole in the bill could allow the monument to be removed. On June 16, 2020, the mayor proposed a $450,000 plan that would have the monument moved from Broad Street to Timothy Place in proximity to the site of Athens' only skirmish during the Civil War at Barber Creek. The mayor's plan was approved by the city commissioners on June 25 as part of a project to make the surrounding area more pedestrian-friendly. Work began on August 10 to remove the monument from the intersection at Broad Street. It is being moved according to the plan approved by the city's commissioners on June 25, but is temporarily being stored in a field until October or November when it can be installed on a new foundation.

The monument was removed in June 2020. Description and history The initiative to build the monument was taken by the United Daughters of the Confederacy, as one of many Confederate monuments they established throughout the country. Construction of the monument began on February 22, 1898 when the cornerstone was laid; it was completed in 1907 and dedicated on May 16 that year. The artists involved were J. D. Couper (designer) and William Couper (sculptor) from Couper Marble Works. It features the text 'Our Confederate Dead, 1861‚Äì1865', the letters 'CSA' (from 'Confederate States of America'), a Confederate battle flag, and the statue of an unidentified Confederate soldier, who is often referred to as \\"Johnny Reb\\". The monument was removed in 1965 to make room for the construction of the Virginia National Bank, but reinstalled six years later in 1971 at about 150 feet from its original location. Removal In the 21st century, there were several calls and legal attempts to have the monument removed, and it was vandalized at least once. In early June 2020, during the George Floyd protests, the Norfolk City Council announced plans to remove the Norfolk Confederate Monument by August 2020. The Downtown Norfolk Council announced that it would no longer clean the monument. On June 12, 2020, the \\"Johnny Reb\\" statue was removed by crane from the top of the monument under orders of Norfolk Mayor Kenny Alexander. Mayor Alexander acknowledged that the state law allowing the monument to be removed had not yet gone into effect. The removal was expedited because of public safety concerns after a protester sustained life-threatening injuries in neighboring Portsmouth days earlier after being hit by a falling statue during protests against the Portsmouth Confederate Monument. Crews later dismantled the 60 foot marble column. Mayor Alexander said the \\"Johnny Reb\\" statue would be put into storage, and an upcoming hearing would determine the future location of the monument.

It lasted a single night but resulted in ‚Ç¨6 million worth of damage in whiskey alone (adjusted for inflation), and took 13 lives. None of the fatalities suffered during the fire were due to smoke inhalation, burns, or any other form of direct contact with the fire itself, but from alcohol poisoning after drinking from the 6-inch (15.24 cm) deep river of whiskey that is said to have flowed as far as the Coombe.  Origin  The fire is believed to have started in Malone's Malt house and a bonded storehouse in the Liberties., where 5,000 barrels of whiskey were being stored. The exact cause of the fire is unknown, but it is known to have started between 4:45pm, when the storehouse was checked, and 8pm, when the alarm was raised. After it began inside the storehouse, it heated the barrels of whiskey to a point where they burst, further accelerating the spread of the fire.  Spread  The fire spread remarkably quickly by all accounts, as the whiskey took to almost all surfaces like petrol. By 10pm the flow of whiskey was six inches deep and stretched 400 meters down along Mill Street to the Coombe, where it came close to burning down the nearby Daughters of Charity convent and Coombe Women & Infants University Hospital. The survival of these sites caused the nuns within to begin praying profusely, thanking God for the miracle of sparing them.  Human Reaction  People living nearby were first alerted to the fire by the sounds of squealing pigs from nearby livestock pens that had caught fire, and this is said to have contributed to a surprisingly rapid evacuation that was later commended by members of the emergency services as well as the Lord Mayor of Dublin at the time, Peter Paul McSwiney. He is quoted as saying the following > ‚ÄúThe time given for escape in some places during the progress of the fire > was so short, I was apprehensive that some people should be left in danger > in the garrets and cellars of the district. But on inquiry I was happy to > learn that no life was lost during the great conflagration.‚Äù During the evacuation many people gathered by the streams of whiskey, filling any vessel to hand with the substance. ‚ÄúCaps, porringers, and other vessels\\" were all gathered to lap up the burning liquid, resulting in 24 hospitalizations due to alcohol poisoning and 13 subsequent fatalities.

In 2018, the court accepted a lawsuit of Alexander Tugushev, formerly Vitaly Orlov‚Äôs and Magnus Roth's business partner, against both of them and their employee Andrey Petrik.  Premises  Tugushev claims that Orlov and Roth, in the early 2000s, unlawfully acquired shares of a company called Almor Atlantica, which later was incorporated into Norebo. Orlov claims that Tugushev disposed of his shares to become a high-ranked Russian official ‚Äî the deputy head of a Russian governmental committee called Goskomrybolovstvo (–ì–æ—Å–∫–æ–º—Ä—ã–±–æ–ª–æ–≤—Å—Ç–≤–æ) ‚Äî the State Committee of the Russian Federation for Fishing. Tugushev‚Äôs position included authority to allot fishing quotas that belonged to the Russian Federation. According to Russian law, no shareholding in commercial entities is allowed for such officials. In July 2003, the significant reform of the fishing quota system in Russia started to eliminate the authority of Goskomrybolovstvo state committee to allot fishing quotas. The head of Goskomrybolovstvo Aleksandr Moyseev invited Tugushev to join the committee to help in reforming the quotas system. In September 2003, Tugushev was appointed as the deputy head of Moyseev. In June 2004, Tugushev was arrested while he headed a commission to liquidate the Goskomrybolovstvo state committee and charged with the bribe of $ 3.7 million received from Pollux fish company. The police claimed that Pollux management was expecting to get a larger fish quotas than it received from Goskomrybolovstvo state committee, headed by Tugushev at that time. In February 2007, a court found Tugushev guilty and received six years in prison. In 2009 he was released from prison on parole and returned to the management in Norebo. Tugushev claims that conviction was politically motivated. Several years later, he signed a settlement agreement with Polluks' owner Sergei Alexandrov in respect of their civil claim. Shortly thereafter he made a claim against Orlov, Roth and Andrey Petrik. In 2015, the conflict between Orlov and Tugushev underwent a severe escalation. Orlov made allegations of extortion and telephone threats. Tugushev filed a criminal complaint accusing Orlov of fraud. criminal proceedings were commenced on 25 July 2018. The first proceedings were commenced on 24 November 2015 at Koptevskiy court apparently by Mr Tugushev (but he denies). Tugushev says that this was sham litigation instigated by Mr Orlov to obstruct and destroy claims of Tugushev.  Related criminal investigations  In 2016, Orlov complained to the police about receiving the threatening telephone calls from someone possibly acting on behalf of Tugushev. Later the one who called Orlov was identified as Mr Dzhamaldaev. The police put Tugushev under house arrest the same year, however Tugushev denied any links to Dzhamaldaev. In December 2017, the investigation was closed with Tugushev found not linked with the Dzhamaldaev. In 2016, Tugushev also made criminal complaints against Orlov in Russia accusing him of fraud which resulted in criminal proceedings commenced on 25 July 2018. Both complaints were based on the allegation that Orlov had unlawfully obtained Tugushev‚Äôs stake in Norebo. As part of these proceedings, Norebo and the related persons have been subjected to several police raids between 26 and 28 September 2018, in which large quantities of documents were collected. Tugushev also convicted Orlov in falsification of documents submitted to the Murmansk court.  Proceedings  In 2018, Tugushev filed a claim over third-part of Norebo to High Court of Justice. In 2019 the High Court of England & Wales confirmed that it has jurisdiction to hear the case between Tugushev and Orlov. In May 2019, Orlov submitted a claim to Murmansk Court objecting against jurisdiction of English court in dispute with Tugushev, however in January 2020, Murmansk court dismissed the claim. In early 2020, Magnus Roth supported the position of Tugushev and accepted that Tugushev is legally entitled to 33% of all Norebo assets. The case is continuing (to be processed) as of May 2020.  More details  In 2018, the volumes of catch of the holding‚Äôs companies amounted to 600 thousand tons. That same year, the High Court of Justice of England and Wales began consideration of the claim filed by Alexander Tugushev against Vitaly Orlov and Magnus Roth, asking to recognize his rights to a third of Norebo Holding. In 2019, the English court recognized its jurisdiction in the dispute. In 2018, the Investigative Committee of Russia instituted a criminal case into the theft from Tugushev of his share in Norebo. That same year, the large- scale searches were conducted in the holding.  Litigations = In Russia  In 2015, a claim was filed to the Koptevsky Court of Moscow, allegedly on behalf of Alexander Tugushev, for the recognition of his rights to a third of Norebo Holding. Tugushev insists that he did not file a claim and that it was a part of scheme to steal Tugushev‚Äôs share in business by Vitaly Orlov. In 2015, a similar situation was staged in the District Court of the Republic of Karelia. That same year, Orlov addressed the police with a complain about extortion of a third of his shares in Norebo by a certain Mr. Dzhamaldaev, allegedly on behalf of Tugushev. The case was dismissed in 2017. In 2018, a criminal case was opened by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation into the theft from Tugushev of his share in Norebo Holding. At the same time, the media reported on Tugushev‚Äôs filing of crime complaints in connection with forgery by Orlov of the evidence and Tugushev‚Äôs signatures on the share purchase agreements signed in 2000.  London Court Hearings  In 2018, Tugushev filed a claim to the High Court of Justice of England and Wales against Orlov and Roth for recognition of his rights to a third in Norebo Holding. In 2019, the High Court of Justice reaffirmed its jurisdiction in this dispute. In May 2019, Orlov has unsuccessfully challenged the jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales to the Arbitration Court of Murmansk Region. At the beginning of 2020, Magnus Roth, a defendant in the case together with Orlov, supported Tugushev‚Äôs claims. He also confirmed that Tugushev was the actual co-owner of Norebo Holding, and Orlov tried to take over the shares of business partners. As of August 2020, the case is still pending. Tugushev v. Orlov case continues a series of disputes pending in the High Court of Justice between the Russian businessmen for a business jointly established by them in the 1990s. Such disputes also include, for example, the proceedings between M. Cherny and O. Deripaska, V. Chernukhin and O. Deripaska, brothers Ruben and O. Deripaska.

It was formed to promote the interests of Chamars for seeking social upliftment into Kshatriya varna.  Foundation  Manik Chand Jatav, Yadavendu Harishchandra and others came in contact with each other in 1910s. They worked for the upliftment of Chamars & freeing caste from this disgraceful name. They campaigned for the adopting 'Jatav' surname replacing with names who denotes lower hierarchy. The name 'Jatav' came from Pandit Sunderlal Sagar's book 'Jatav Jivan' and Ramnarayan Yadavendu's 'Yaduvansh Ka Itihas' who were based on their similar heritage and clans of Yadavs and Jats of Braj region.

British govt. established cantonments in Agra, Delhi, Meerut, Kanpur and other prominent cities which gave Chamars opportunity to prove themselves they got tenders for making leather products for British Indian Army, and many Jatavs got included into army also. This change created an impact on local Chamars and they starter organising under one umbrella. In 1931 census, they played an aggressive role for their demand as inclusion of Chamars into Kshatriya fold and renaming them as 'Jatav' from Chamar.

It can claim to be the earliest English Arthurian romance. It exists in two recensions: the first, of nearly 10,000 lines, dates from the second half of the 13th century, and the much-abridged second recension, of about 2000 lines, from the 15th century. The first recension breaks off somewhat inconclusively, and many scholars believe this romance was never completed. Arthur and Merlin's main source is the Estoire de Merlin, a French prose romance.  Synopsis  Constans, eldest son of king Constance of England, inherits his father's kingdom, but defends his country so poorly against the invading Danes, led by Angys, that his barons murder him and enthrone his treacherous steward, Vortigern. Constans's two younger brothers, Ambrosius Aurelianus and Uther Pendragon, flee the country. Civil war breaks out, but Vortigern prevails with Angys' help; he rewards Angys with lands and marries his daughter. Fearing an invasion by Aurelius and Uther, Vortigern tries to build a castle for his own protection at Salisbury, but every night the walls collapse. His clerks advise him that the walls must be smeared with the blood of a child who was begotten by no man. The Devil fathers a child by raping a pious girl, hoping that that his son will be as evil as Jesus was good. This child, Merlin, is baptised by the girl's confessor, , and as he begins to grow it is discovered that he is good, not evil, and that he has magical powers and great wisdom. Brought before Vortigern, he explains that a red dragon and a white dragon are fighting under the foundations of his castle. When they are dug up the white dragon kills the red one, and Merlin explains that this is an omen of Vortigern's coming expulsion by the rightful heir. Aurelius and Uther duly arrive, burn Vortigern in his castle, and kill Angys. Uther becomes king and drives out a fresh invasion of Danish \\"Saracens\\", though Aurelis is killed in this enterprise. With Merlin's help, Uther reigns long and prosperously, conquering foreign lands and setting up the Round Table as an order of chivalry. He falls in love with Ygerne, wife of the Duke of Cornwall, and sleeps with her. When the duke is killed in battle Uther and Ygerne marry. Their son Arthur is born, and is given by Merlin to be fostered by Sir Ector, who raises him along with his own son, Kay. Uther dies, and Arthur proves his right to the throne by pulling the sword Estalibore from a miraculous stone. Merlin and Ector reveal the boy's true identity, and he is crowned. Many kings refuse to acknowledge Arthur, and he embarks on a series of wars in which, with Merlin's constant aid, he eventually defeats first the rebel kings and then yet another army of invading Danes. Gawain and his brothers, sons of the rebellious King Lot, travel to London to join Arthur, but he is not there, and in his absence London is being attacked by pagan armies, which the brothers defeat. Arthur is meanwhile, in incognito, aiding king Leodegan of Carohaise against his enemy king Rion, and at the same time falling in love with Leodegan's daughter Gvenour. The poem returns to Merlin, Gawain, his brothers and their allies, whose many battles against the pagan armies are related one after another. Arthur is betrothed to Gvenour and defeats Rion.  Manuscripts and recensions  Of Arthour and of Merlin survives in five medieval and early modern manuscripts: * Edinburgh, National Library of Scotland, MS Advocates 19.2.1 (the Auchinleck Manuscript), c. 1330 * London, Lincoln's Inn Library, MS 150, late 14th century * Oxford, Bodleian Library, MS Douce 236, late 15th century * London, British Library, MS Harley 6223, c. 1560 * London, British Library, MS Additional 27879 (Percy Folio), c. 1650 The earliest and fullest recension of the poem, of 9,938 lines, exists only in the Auchinleck Manuscript. This includes a prologue which does not appear in other manuscripts, and which may have been authored by a different poet. The second recension, surviving in the later manuscripts, includes only the first fifth of the story, and concludes at the end of Uther's reign. The wording of the second recension is so drastically different from the first as to suggest that it had at some point in its textual history been transmitted by memory rather than transcription.  Date, authorship and audience  The first recension of the poem is believed to have been written in Kent or the London area in the second half of the 13th century, making it the oldest known English Arthurian romance. The second recension dates from the 15th century. The name of the original author is unknown, but stylistic, thematic, dialectal and other similarities have led some scholars to believe that he was the same poet who wrote the romances King Alisaunder, Richard Coer de Lyon, and perhaps The Seven Sages of Rome. Scholars often treat this romance as having been intended for a popular audience, but it has also been argued that it was aimed at the gentry or even at children.  Sources  The primary source of the poem is the French prose romance called the Estoire de Merlin, the second romance in the Vulgate Cycle, but in the sections before Arthur's coronation it also draws on some unidentifiable work in the Brut tradition, that is to say one of the chronicles of pseudohistory based on Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae. It simplifies the story of the Estoire de Merlin by omitting passages of psychological subtlety and concentrating on simple narrative action; the element of courtly love is downplayed while battle and feasting scenes are expanded. Aurelis becomes a more minor character than in the Estoire, and Merlin is not, as in the earlier work, a prophet of the Grail.  Criticism  Of the first, pre-Arthurian, section of this romance John Edwin Wells observed that \\"the incidents...are attractive, partly because they are presented fluently, realistically, and dramatically\\", while Dieter Mehl conceded that it \\"is held together by a certain tension and unity of plot\\". There is, however, general agreement that the second part, dealing almost exclusively with Arthur's many wars, tends toward monotony through want of differentiation between his many battles. J. A. W. Bennett and Douglas Gray found the main interest of the poem to lie in the character of \\"Merlin, the mystery man. By turns shape-shifter, strategist, master of statecraft...his disguises are always intriguing, his appearances always dramatic\\". Several critics have approved the poet's smooth handling of his metre, the four-stress couplet, Likewise there has been praise for the lyrical verses on the seasons of the year with which the romance is sprinkled. It has been noted that the poet was capable of using rhetorical devices, including repetition, homely similes, the rhetorical question and, especially, the use of those verbal formulas that typify epic poetry.  Legacy  Enough late manuscripts of Arthur and Merlin survive to show that it was in the late middle ages and beyond one of the most popular English chivalric romances. It is therefore not surprising that there was a chapbook version of it, A Lytel Treatyse of √æe Byrth and Prophecye of Marlyn, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1510, which was in turn the main source of a Dutch chapbook, the Historie van Merlijn (c. 1540). In the mid-18th century Thomas Percy became aware of Arthur and Merlin through his ownership of the 17th-century folio manuscript that now bears his name, in which a copy of the second recension appears; he wrote in the manuscript itself that it was \\"more correct and perfect than any in this book\\". The antiquary George Ellis included a very detailed abstract of this romance, covering 120 pages, in his Specimens of Early English Metrical Romances (1805).

The restaurant is known for its rib tips, which Eater has described as Chicago's \\"most famous rib tips.\\" History Lem's Bar-B-Q was founded in 1951 by Myles Lemons in the Greater Grand Crossing neighborhood in Chicago. Lemons operated the restaurant with his brothers, Bruce and James. The Lemons brothers were born in Indianola, Mississippi and moved to Chicago in 1948 to pursue careers in the barbecue industry. In 1968, they opened a second restaurant in a former ice cream shop in the Chatham neighborhood of Chicago. It was at the second location where they first served their rib tips. The Greater Grand Crossing location eventually closed. Lem's trademarked their brand in 2006. In 2018, Lem's sent a cease and desist letter to Chicago Brewhouse, when the brewhouse listed \\"Lem's BBQ Sauce\\" as the sauce served with its rib tips. James Lemons, who eventually became Lem's owner and the last brother to remain working at the business, died at age 87 in 2015. In his memory, the Lem's menu features the JBL combo. His daughters Carmen Lemons and Lynn Walker became owners upon his death. William D. Lemons, Jr. serves as chef. Cuisine Lem's rib tips served with white bread and sides of barbecue sauce Lem's most famous dish is their rib tips, which were first introduced in 1968. The rib tips have been called \\"iconic\\" by Eater and described as \\"smoky, finger-licking tips with a tangy, vinegary sauce.\\" The ribs are smoked in a smoker housed in an aquarium and finished quickly over a hot fire fueled by hickory wood. The restaurant sells an average of 360 rib slabs a week. The Lem's barbecue sauce recipe was the Lemons' mothers recipe. The sauce is prepared fresh daily. The menu also includes fried chicken, barbecue chicken, and hot links. Reception The restaurant has been called a \\"barbecue icon\\" in the United States by Eater and a \\"civic treasure\\" in Chicago by the Chicago Reader. It was named one of Eater's \\"essential barbecue restaurants in Chicago\\" in 2019. Lem's has also been named one of the top barbecue restaurants in the country by Time Out and Zagat.

The series is a reboot of the ABC Mystery Theater radio and television series. It was produced by the Danzigers and starred Donald Gray as Mark Saber. It mostly ran during prime time in the late 1950s.  Background  ABC had originally broadcast a radio series called ABC Mystery Theater alongside a television series of the same name from 1951 to 1954. In the TV series, Mark Saber was portrayed by Tom Conway and his assistant Tim Maloney was portrayed by James Burke. Saber was a British detective working in an American homicide department. In the meantime in 1954, the Danzigers were developing a mystery anthology series called The Vise. It was hosted by Australian actor Ron Randell and was broadcast on various ITV channels in the UK, as well as syndicated episodes of The Pendulum in the US; The Crooked Path on ITV, and Tension on ITV.

They rebooted the Mark Saber drama and television series that was running on ABC in the US. Saber, portrayed by Donald Gray, was now a one- armed private detective in London and would be solving mysteries occurring in the UK as well as in Paris and the Riviera. Instead of Maloney, Saber had various assistants. Gray himself was also an amputee. Screenplays were done by Mark Grantham, Brian Clemens, and others. Episodes were formatted for the half-hour time slot. Two episodes were shot every five days. In an interview with Wheeler W. Dixon, Clemens said that in the four years he wrote for the show, he only went on set with the Danzigers about eight times. The budgets for the episodes were about 17 thousand pounds for a feature, and shooting took about 8-10 days,  Broadcast  For the 1955-56 television season, The Vise aired on ABC at 9:30 p.m. EST on Fridays. It also aired at the same time for the 1956-57 season. In 1957, the show was moved to NBC and retitled Saber of London, when it aired at 7:30 p.m. EST on Fridays. In the 1957‚Äì58 season, it competed against Leave It to Beaver on CBS and The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin on ABC. The Vise was also shown as The Vise: Mark Saber on ITV companies in Europe. In the 1958‚Äì1959 season, Saber of London switched to 7 p.m. Sundays, opposite CBS's Lassie. In its last year, 1959‚Äì1960, it was moved a half-hour earlier just outside prime time to 6:30 p.m EST on Sundays, just outside prime time. It also continued to run on ITV channels at various times in the UK.

It is comprises the fishing companies located in the Russian North- West and Far East, trading companies, a fish processing plant and a cargo handling terminal with cold storages and berthing facilities. The Group was founded in 1997 by Alexander Tugushev, Vitaly Orlov and Magnus Roth.  History  In the late 1990s, Tugushev, Orlov and Roth were partners in Ocean Trawlers. This company was used to further develop their business by joining other enterprises, and gradually their business turned into a fishing holding. Aside from buying fish, the partners began offering Norwegian trawlers for rent (bareboat charter), understanding that it is impossible to achieve the required efficiency and quality of supplies by using the old Soviet vessels left from the times of the All-Union Fishery Association (VRPO) Sevryba. By 2005, Ocean Trawlers‚Äô fleet consisted of 14 trawlers. In 2019, Norebo consisted of 16 fishing companies. In September 2003, Tugushev became Deputy Head of the State Fisheries Committee responsible for the development of a new system for distribution of fishing quotas. Because of occupying the civil servant position, Tugushev had to formally re-register his rights to Norebo to the third parties. Until 2016, the company was called Karat Fishing Holding, and the name Norebo was taken in 2016. In 2018, the volumes of catch of the holding‚Äôs companies amounted to 600 thousand tons.  Present days  Norebo Holding is the largest taxpayer and employer in the city of Murmansk (pop. ~300 000) ‚Äî a significant Russian Arctic stronghold situated within the boundaries of the Arctic Circle. Several companies of the holding are included in the list of systemically important organizations of the agro-industrial complex of Russia (compiled by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Russian Federation). Holding supports environmental projects aimed at preserving the fishing fields. The companies of Norebo Group (in particular, PJSC Murmansk Trawl Fleet, JSC Rybprominvest) are the largest sponsors in Murmansk Region of the United Russia Political Party. Vitaly Orlov (ranking No. 90 on Russian Forbes) is a 100% shareholder of the holding, (being a nominal holder of a certain part of shares), while two other co-founders of the holding, Alexander Tugushev and Magnus Roth, call in question Orlov‚Äôs rights to a significant portion of Norebo shares. The media repeatedly accused Norebo Holding and Vitaly Orlov of tax avoidance, including by the use of transfer pricing.  Holding Structure  As of 2019, the holding consists of 16 fishing companies and a number of infrastructure units. Its structural units are divided into directions: administration and management, fish harvesting and transporting, processing and infrastructure, and trading. Trading units include Norebo Africa (African market), Norebo Hong Kong and Norebo Europe (markets outside the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU)), Norebo Asia and Norebo Ru (operating in the EAEU). The holding builds new vessels, factories and a refrigerator terminal. It is also involved in the development of a modernized bottom fishing trawl.  Products  According to the company‚Äôs own information, its present product assortment includes about 100 different types of products from groundfish and pelagic fish and other aquatic biological resources, including: frozen fish products, fish fillets, minced fish; caviar, liver and other by-products; squid. The Russian market remains the largest market for the company, while its products can be found throughout Europe. One of Norebo‚Äôs partners is the Danish company Espersen, which is involved into secondary processing of fish and supplying it to the largest retail chains and restaurants in the European Union, including McDonald's.  London court hearings  In 2018, the High Court of Justice in London began to hear a dispute related to Norebo shareholding. It was preceded by a number of investigations in Russia mainly related to Tugushev's claims that he owns a part of the today's company (see article Norebo conflict).

Built in 1833, the building has also been used as a Granada cinema. It is currently leased to a number of companies, including Next and the Boston Tea Party caf√© chain. History The Corn Exchange was built between 1832 and 1833 by local architect George Draper, on the corner of East Street and Baffin's Lane in Chichester. In 1835 the roof was found to be unsafe and the building was stated to be in danger of collapse; architect John Elliott rebuilt and remodelled it the following year. The Corn Exchange was financed by 70 local corn merchants, who each contributed between ¬£25 and ¬£250. Corn, wheat, oats and barley were commonly traded at the Corn Exchange, and in 1899 wool fleeces were also recorded as being sold at auction at the Corn Exchange. The Corn Exchange was set up to increase trade of goods, as local merchants were unwilling to sell small quantities of goods. They preferred to sell at least a bushel at a time. The Corn Exchange also allowed merchants to sample goods before purchasing them. Blue plaque at the Corn Exchange. From the 1880s, parts of the Corn Exchange were rented out as a cinema. It was one of Chichester's first cinemas, and the Corn Exchange has a blue plaque commemorating this. In 1922, the Corn Exchange became a full-time cinema, and the following year, the cinema was purchased by London and District Cinemas. In 1927, the cinema was renovated, and was renamed the Exchange Cinema. The Kid Brother was the first film shown at the renovated cinema. In 1948, Granada cinemas took over the Corn Exchange, and named it the Granada Exchange. The Granada cinema closed in 1980. Star Wars film The Empire Strikes Back was the last film shown at the Granada cinema. The Corn Exchange was then left unused for six years, before being leased to McDonald's, who used it until at least the late 1990s. Part of the Corn Exchange is currently leased to Next. In 2018, Next said that they were looking to close their Chichester Corn Exchange store. Other companies that have been based in the Corn Exchange include the Boston Tea Party caf√© chain, a Grape Tree health food store, and two Indian restaurants. To the rear stood a three-storey corn store built of red and grey brick. This was modified and converted into offices in 1967. Another corn store designed in 1871 by architect John Elkington, this time of stone with brick dressings, was similarly converted in the early 1980s. Architecture The building is Greek Revivalist in style. Across the front of the building are six Doric columns, each of which weigh 3 tonnes and are made of cast iron. They form a \\"noble hexastyle portico\\" which projects on to the pavement and rests on six substantial stone bases. There are four smaller columns behind it. These support a large pediment and decorative entablature which runs around the side elevations of the building.

It is also used as a normal colloquial term and self-denomination.  History  \\"Kartoffel\\" refers to a person of German descent, particularly an ethnic German from the perspective of allochthone populations in Germany. Use of the word was popularised in the 1960s, when it was commonly used as a derogatory term to describe people of German descent. The first known use of the word in a similar sense was in 1873, when the Grimms' Deutsches W√∂rterbuch used it in a teasing manner to describe inhabitants of the Ore Mountains as Kartoffelw√§nste (\\"potato tummies\\"), because potatoes were the only substance that they ate, whether out of poverty, habit, or both.Deutsches W√∂rterbuch. Band 11 (= Band 5 der Originalausgabe), S. Hirzel, Leipzig 1873, Sp. 244‚Äì245. (Online here.)  Controversies  The term \\"Kartoffel\\" has been used in debates about Germanophobia. In 2010, Kristina Schr√∂der, the Minister for Family Affairs, stated in a television interview for the ARD that children were being described as \\"German potatoes\\" or \\"German sluts\\". She described such insults as a form of racism. Ehrhart K√∂rting, the Berlin Senator of the Interior and Cem √ñzdemir, co-chair of the Alliance 90/The Greens party called for consistent action against such behavior, whilst the Alliance 90/The Greens politician Sven-Christian Kindler described Schr√∂der's statements as \\"pseudo- scientific, dangerous nonsense\\". German journalist Julian Reichelt was nominated for the Goldene Kartoffel (\\"golden potato\\") award in 2018 by the Neue deutsche Medienmacher (\\"New German Media Makers\\") association, for Bild- Zeitung on writing reports on the poor and immigration. Reichelt rejected the award, claiming that the term \\"Kartoffel\\" had evolved into a \\"racial insult on German school yards and is by no means well intentioned.\\" \\"Kartoffel\\" later appeared in public debate concerning Germany's national football team after they were knocked out of the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. According to an article published in the German magazine Der Spiegel, the German football team was said to be segregated into self-appointed groups, Kanake (derogatory slang for \\"foreigner\\"), including international players J√©r√¥me Boateng, Mesut √ñzil, and Julian Draxler, and Kartoffel, with \\"typical\\" Germans like Thomas M√ºller and Mats Hummels. The difference between these groups is mainly associated with the players' lifestyles: the more lavishly living Kanake group mad made fun of the lifestyle of the Kartoffeln. In response to news coverage of this, national players ƒ∞lkay G√ºndoƒüan and Lukas Podolski, active players in the DFB until 2017, said that it was harmless teasing. German satirist and late-night show host Jan B√∂hmermann described the authors of German Wikipedia as mainly white Germans with no immigration background on Neo Magazin Royale in April 2019. He created the article Kartoffel (Slang) on German Wikipedia to see whether the material, which would offend this group of people, would remain on Wikipedia.

The Czech Republic is one of the seven countries currently bordering Poland. This condition persists since January 1, 1993, when Czechoslovakia collapsed. The current border with the Czech Republic was part of the border with Czechoslovakia and had the same route. History Polish border with the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia The Polish-Czech border can also be called the border existing for several months in 1939. On March 16, 1939, the German Reich, after Slovakia declared independence (in fact it client state of Nazi Germany), created from the occupied territories of Bohemia, Moravia and Czech Silesia, which were not directly attached to Germany as the Sudetenland or to Poland as Zaolzie, Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. It constituted an autonomous German administrative unit that bordered Poland over a distance of 66 kilometers, and the border coincided with a fragment of the former Polish-Czechoslovak border. This border ceased to exist on September 28, 1939, when, after the aggression of Germany the USSR against Poland, the armies of both countries fully occupied the territory of the Second Polish Republic, as a result of which the German and Soviet authorities signed a pact on borders and friendship, which marked the German- Soviet border in the occupied territory of Poland. During the demarcation of the border in 1958, Poland transferred 1205.9 ha to Czechoslovakia, while Czechoslovakia to Poland 837.46 ha.

The Militia had always been important in the county, which was vulnerable to invasion, and from its formal creation in 1758 the regiment served in home defence in all of Britain's major wars until 1908, after which it became a reserve unit for the Devonshire Regiment. Background The universal obligation to military service in the Shire levy was long established in England and its legal basis was updated by two Acts of 1557, which placed selected men, the 'Trained Bands', under the command of Lords Lieutenant appointed by the monarch. This is seen as the starting date for the organised county militia in England. The Devon Trained Bands were divided into three 'Divisions' (East, North and South), which were called out in the Armada year of 1588.Hay, pp. 11‚Äì17, 25‚Äì6, 88.Hay, pp. 269‚Äì71.Walrond, pp. 1‚Äì17. Although control of the militia was one of the areas of dispute between King Charles I and Parliament that led to the First English Civil War, most of the county Trained Bands played little part in the fighting. After the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 the militia of Devon were called out on a number of occasions when the appearance of hostile fleets caused alarm, and in 1685 they prevented the rebel Duke of Monmouth from accessing recruits and supplies from Devon and Cornwall. After the Battle of Sedgemoor the Devon Militia were active in rounding up rebels. Hay, pp. 99‚Äì104.Scott.Walrond, pp. 23‚Äì4. The Devonshire Militia continued to be mustered for training during the reign of William III, the six 'county' regiments together with the Exeter and Plymouth regiments and several Troops of Horse, mustering 6163 men.Hay, pp. 116‚Äì7. But after the Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 the militia was allowed to dwindle.Western, p. 73.Walrond, pp. 25‚Äì7. East Devon Militia=Seven Years War Under threat of French invasion during the Seven Years' War a series of Militia Acts from 1757 re-established county militia regiments, the men being conscripted by means of parish ballots (paid substitutes were permitted) to serve for three years. Front-line Devonshire was initially given a quota of 1600 men to raise. There was a property qualification for officers, who were commissioned by the Lord Lieutenant.Fortescue, Vol II, pp. 288, 299, 301‚Äì2, 521.Hay, pp. 136‚Äì44.Holmes, pp. 94‚Äì100.'Militia and Volunteer Lists' at Devon ‚Äì Military History.Walrond, pp. 28‚Äì31.Western, Appendices A & B.Western, p. 251. The first issue of arms to the Devon Militia was made on 5 December 1758, and they were embodied for permanent service on 23 June 1759. Two, later four (Exeter, North, East and South), battalions were formed in Devon under the command of the Duke of Bedford as Lord Lieutenant. They served in the West Country for the whole of their service; the duties included guarding French prisoners of war. In December 1762 the battalions were stood down ('disembodied') and the following year were reorganised into three peacetime regiments. The Exeter and East battalions combined to form a single regiment, the 1st or East Devon Militia, of 600 men, 30 Sergeants and 20 Drummers, organised into 10 companies, with its headquarters (HQ) at Exeter and the Duke of Bedford as its Colonel.Frederick, p. 86.H.G. Parkyn, 'English Militia Regiments 1757‚Äì1935: Their Badges and Buttons', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol 15, No 60 (Winter 1936), pp. 216‚Äì248.Walrond, pp. 31‚Äì59.Walrond, Appendix A.Western, p. 124. Sir John Prideaux, 6th Baronet, Colonel of the disbanded East Devon battalion, took legal action against the Duke of Bedford and the Deputy lieutenants for the loss of his command, and refused to give up the battalion's arms and accoutrements in his care until 1764.Walrond, pp. 55‚Äì8, Appendix B. War of American Independence The militiamen's peacetime training was widely neglected, but the Devonshire regiments do appear to have completed their training each year. The Duke of Bedford died in 1771, and Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Richard Bampfylde, 4th Baronet, MP, resigned, so the new Lord Lieutenant, Earl Poulett, recommended the son of a local landowner, Major John Dyke Acland, 20th Foot, for the colonelcy. After the outbreak of the War of American Independence in 1775 Lord North's government introduced a Bill in Parliament to 'Enable His Majesty to call out and assemble the Militia in all cases of Rebellion in any part of the Dominion belonging to the Crown of Great Britain'. Colonel Acland (himself MP for Callington) presented an Address to the King on behalf of the East Devon Militia in support of the Bill, which was vehemently condemned by the Bill's opponents including Edmund Burke and Charles James Fox; the Bill was passed in December 1775.Walrond, pp. 59‚Äì65. In 1776‚Äì7 Col Acland served in his Regular Army rank of major in the Saratoga campaign under his friend and fellow MP Maj-Gen John Burgoyne. Acland commanded the Grenadier battalion and was severely wounded and captured. He was well-treated by his captors, and after his return to England was challenged to a duel by an officer who resented his favourable comments on the Americans. Although Acland survived the duel, he is believed to have died from the effects of a chill caught on the day.Walrond, p. 68. The militia was called out when Britain was threatened with invasion by the Americans' allies, France and Spain, and the regiment was embodied at Exeter on 20 April 1778. Earl Poulett appointed his eldest son, Viscount Hinton, to succeed Acland as colonel of the East Devons, and soothed the lieutenant-colonel, Paul Orchard, by promoting him to take over the North Devons, which were in disorder. The East Devons remained at Exeter until November, when the companies were distributed to winter quarters in Somerset, at Wells, Glastonbury and Shepton Mallet. During the summer of 1779 the East Devon Militia was at Coxheath Camp near Maidstone in Kent, which was the army's largest training camp, where the Militia were exercised as part of a division alongside Regular troops while providing a reserve in case of French invasion of South East England. The East Devons were brigaded with the East Suffolk Militia and Monmouth Militia. Each battalion had two small field- pieces or 'battalion guns' attached to it, manned by men of the regiment instructed by a Royal Artillery sergeant and two gunners. In November the regiment was widely dispersed to winter quarters in Surrey, with HQ at Kingston upon Thames. Two extra companies of volunteers were now attached to the regiment and served with it for the rest of the period of embodiment.Walrond, pp. 66‚Äì84.Brig Charles Herbert, 'Coxheath Camp, 1778‚Äì1779', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol 45, No 183 (Autumn 1967), pp. 129‚Äì48. For the summer of 1780 the regiment was camped with the 6th Foot at Playden Heights in Sussex. It returned to Somerset for its winter quarters, where the men who had completed their tree-year term of service were allowed home furlough, in the hope that they would make bargains to serve as substitutes for the next batch of men chosen by ballot, and then return to the regiment as trained men. However, the ranks were full of recruits that summer. The summers of 1781 and 1782 were spent in Devon at Roborough Camp and the Maker Redoubts near Plymouth, where both Regulars and Militia (including all three Devon regiments) were gathered. The Light Companies of the regiments at Roborough were formed into a composite Light Battalion, which trained separately. The Militia also had to find guards for the American prisoners of war lodged in Mill Prison. The camp at Roborough was broken up on 10 November 1782 and the regiments went into winter quarters. The East Devons were quartered at Bristol, where they had to find the guards for American prisoners confined in Stapleton Prison. American independence was recognised in November 1782, and peace was settled with France and Spain early in 1783, so the militia could be stood down. The East Devons marched to Exeter and were disembodied there on 24 March.Walrond, pp. 84‚Äì109.Fortescue, Vol III, pp. 173‚Äì4. French Revolutionary War From 1787 to 1793 the East Devon Militia was assembled for its annual 28 days' training, but to save money only two-thirds of the men were mustered each year. In view of the worsening international situation the whole Devonshire Militia was embodied for service on 22 December 1792, even though Revolutionary France did not declare war on Britain until 1 February 1793. In February the regiment sent a detachment to Plymouth to be trained to operate battalion guns, and the rest marched to Surrey, moving in July to Dover, where seven companies were stationed in Dover Castle, two in the town, and one at Archcliffe Fort.Fortescue, Vol III, pp. 530‚Äì1.Walrond, pp. 110‚Äì24.G.H. Hennessy, 'Order Books of the 1st Devon Regiment in 1793', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol 47, No 192 (Winter 1969), pp. 215‚Äì21. In April 1794 the regiment marched to Salisbury and then on to Bristol, where the principal duty once more was guarding French prisoners in Stapleton Prison. The following year the regiment spent the summer in camp at Roborough. The winter of 1795‚Äì6 was spent in barracks at Plymouth Dock, guarding the Mill Prison, which posting continued during 1796 apart from autumn manoeuvres at Roborough. In March 1798 the standing militia regiments were reinforced by men from the newly-raised Supplementary Militia, the remainder forming new regiments (such as the 4th Devon Militia formed at Exeter). In October the 1st Devons left Plymouth for winter quarters at Berry Head, Totnes, Dartmouth and surrounding villages, and remained in these quarters throughout 1799. In November that year the Militia was partially disembodied, some of the men being stood down with the whole of the Supplementary Militia; 70 of the men turned out of the 1st Devon enlisted in the Regular Army (which was part of the motivation for the change). In February 1800 the regiment returned to Plymouth Dock barracks and was concentrated for the first time in 18 months. The duties as usual were to guard the dockyard and the French prisoners, and also riot duty. Bread riots and looting broke out in Plymouth on 31 March 1801 and the magistrates were unable to restore order with the detachments of militia available. Colonel Bastard of the 1st Devon returned on 4 April and took matters in hand, seizing firearms in the docks to prevent them falling into the hands of the rioters (who had been joined by striking dockyard hands) and calling out the Volunteers to back up his own detachments. It was several months before disturbances in the West Country were put down: the regiment remained on standby to march at short notice, all leave was cancelled, and the men who had been disembodied were recalled to the colours. However, a peace treaty having been agreed (the Treaty of Amiens), the Militia were disembodied in early 1802. The 1st Devon marched from Plymouth Dock on 7 April, arriving at Exeter on 12 April, to be disembodied on 20 April.Walrond, pp. 125‚Äì203. Napoleonic Wars The Peace of Amiens did not last long, and the Militia were soon called out again. The warrant to embody the Devon and Exeter Militia was sent to the Lord Lieutenant (Earl Fortescue) on 11 March 1803, and the 1st Devon of eight companies was practically complete by 5 April, with its HQ at Exeter Castle. On 21 May the regiment was ordered to march to Plymouth Dock, where it arrived on 26 May, the garrison including all three Devon Militia regiments. The duties once again included guarding French prisoners in Mill Prison. In June the Supplementary Militia was also embodied, and the 1st Devon Militia was increased to 10 companies (860 all ranks). The Plymouth garrison trained on Buckland Down, with particular emphasis on the Light Companies, and six chosen men from each of the other companies trained as marksmen alongside the Light Companies. In August the 1st Devons camped at Wembury a few miles from Plymouth, where they helped to build a redoubt at the mouth of the River Yealm. On 16 November the camp was broken up and the regiment dispersed to winter quarters: two companies to Dartmouth, four to Kingsbridge and Modbury, two to the Yealm redoubt (now used as a penal establishment) and the two flank companies on detached duty; the companies were regularly rotated between these stations. Combined drill with the Volunteers and Yeomanry was instituted. On 10 June 1803 part of the detachment at Yealm battery rowed out in boats to help recover a collier that had been attacked by a French Privateer. The regiment was concentrated for training in the summer of 1803, then went to Mill Bay Barracks for the following winter, with the exception of detachments at Yealm battery, Berry Head, and manning warning beacons. As usual the duty included guarding prisoners, while craftsmen in the ranks were employed on government works.Walrond, pp. 204‚Äì26. In 1805 there was a drive to induce militiamen to volunteer for the Regular Army (or the Royal Marines, in the case of men from Devon and Cornwall). The number of men 'allowed' to volunteer (ie the target) was set at 222 for the 1st Devons, but not more than 100 accepted. In October the regiment marched from Plymouth to Portsmouth, where it was quartered in Portsea Barracks, brigaded with the North Devon and North Hampshire Militia. In April 1806 it moved to Lewes in Sussex, where it formed part of the Brighton brigade, and then in July to Eastbourne where the men assisted in the construction of Martello towers. In November the regiment returned to Exeter for its winter quarters. In the summer of 1807 it was back at Plymouth Dock. Another recruitment drive for men to transfer to the Line regiments was accompanied by balloting to bring the Militia up to strength: the 1st Devon required 335 men in December to replace volunteers and time- expired men. Again in 1810, the Militia were increased by half their establishment, and recruits were obtained 'by beat of drum' (as in regiments of the Line) as well as by the ballot and by volunteers from the Local Militia, which had replaced the Volunteer Corps.Walrond, pp. 229‚Äì57. The 1st Devon spent much of 1809 in the unpopular duty of guarding the Prison ships in Plymouth Harbour. In May 1810 it marched to Kingston upon Thames and from there to Hythe, Kent, where it guarded the Royal Military Canal. In November it moved to winter quarters in Chelmsford, Essex, where duties were light, though they included marching parties of prisoners of war to the great camp at Norman Cross. The summer of 1811 was spent at Winchester, the march beginning at the end of June. In 1812 there was an outbreak of Luddite machine-breaking and the regiment spent much of the year constantly on the move round the industrial Midlands. Having concentrated at Winchester it moved in April to Warwick, then to Derby, Burton upon Trent, Loughborough and Lichfield, with detached companies going to other towns. The winter was spent at Lichfield and Tamworth, Staffordshire, before returning to Plymouth Dock in 1813.Walrond, pp. 257‚Äì91. Efforts were made to extend the service of the Militia. In 1811 bounties were offered for service in Ireland, and the 1st Devon formed a company of 69 volunteers. But in 1814 only one man and three officers volunteered for garrison duty in Europe.Walrond, pp. 272, 290. In December 1813 the regiment was marched from Plymouth to Bristol, where it took up duties at Stapleton Prison once more. It returned to Plymouth in May 1814, but by now the war was over, the Treaty of Fontainebleau having been signed in April. Plymouth was busy with militia regiments returning from Ireland to be disembodied, and returning British prisoners of war. On 16 June the warrant for disembodying the Devonshire Militia was signed and the regiment returned to Exeter to complete the process by 9 August.Walrond, pp. 291‚Äì301. Ireland Napoleon's escape from Elba and return to power in France in 1815 meant that the Militia had to be called out once more. The regiments began recruiting for volunteers 'by beat of drum' from 25 April and the warrant for embodying the Devonshire Militia was issued on 16 June, with the 1st Devon to be embodied at Exeter on 24 July. By then the decisive Battle of Waterloo had already been fought, but the process of embodiment went on while the Regulars were away in the Army of Occupation in France. However, in the absence of a fresh ballot only a small number of men whose time was not yet expired were available: the regiment mustered 25 sergeants, 17 drummers and 130 rank and file. Together with the few recruits who had been obtained, they marched to Plymouth on 7 August, leaving a recruiting party at Exeter. On 27 October the regiment embarked aboard the Seringapatam transport for service in Ireland. One sergeant, three drummers and 11 privates refused to serve in Ireland and were attached to the Derby Militia at Plymouth. The regiment disembarked at Cobh on 5 November and marched to Cork Barracks. It then moved to Fermoy Barracks on 8 November, sending a number of detachments to outlying posts. The regiment remained at Fermoy until 16 April 1816, when it returned to Cork, re-embarked on the Seringapatam and reached Plymouth on 20 April. It was disembodied on 1 May.Walrond, pp. 302‚Äì7. Long Peace In 1817 an Act was passed that allowed the annual training of the Militia to be dispensed with. So although officers continued to be commissioned into the regiment and the ballot was regularly held, the selected men were rarely mustered for drill. The regiment assembled 450 strong for 28 days' drill in 1820, and for 21 days the following year. Training was held again in 1825 at Exeter, when rewards were offered for 31 men who had failed to appear and were listed as deserters.Trewman's Exeter Flying Post, 4 August 1825, quoted at Devon ‚Äì Military History.Walrond, pp. 311‚Äì7. Training was held in 1831, but not again before 1852, and the ballot lapsed. The permanent staff of the regiment in 1819 consisted of the adjutant, paymaster and surgeon, sergeant-major and drum-major, and one sergeant and corporal for every 40 men (12 of each) and one drummer for every two companies plus the flank companies (6), but these were progressively reduced so that by 1835 there were only the adjutant, sergeant-major and six sergeants, while the other long-serving men were pensioned off. In 1834 the permanent staff had been under arms during trade union disturbances in Exeter, but an inspecting officer found nine of them unfit due to age or infirmity. Again in 1847 the permanent staff and pensioners were called out to assist special constables to put down food riots in Exeter.Hart's.Walrond, pp. 317‚Äì28. 1st Devon Militia The Militia of the United Kingdom was reformed by the Militia Act of 1852, enacted during a period of international tension. As before, units were raised and administered on a county basis, and filled by voluntary enlistment (although conscription by means of the Militia Ballot might be used if the counties failed to meet their quotas). Training was for 56 days on enlistment, then for 21‚Äì28 days per year, during which the men received full army pay. The permanent staff was increased. Under the Act, Militia units could be embodied by Royal Proclamation for full-time home defence service in three circumstances:Dunlop, pp. 42‚Äì5.Grierson, pp. 12, 27‚Äì8.Hay, pp. 155‚Äì6.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 91‚Äì2, 162‚Äì3.Walrond, pp. 329‚Äì30. * 1. 'Whenever a state of war exists between Her Majesty and any foreign power'. * 2. 'In all cases of invasion or upon imminent danger thereof'. * 3. 'In all cases of rebellion or insurrection'. Under the Act, the militia establishment for Devon was fixed at two regiments of infantry and one of artillery. The North Devon Militia were converted to artillery in 1853 and the surplus men and equipment taken over by the 1st Devon. The 1st Devon now dropped the 'East Devon' title. The reorganised regiment assembled at the Artillery Barracks in Exeter for 21 days' training on 26 October 1852, with the assistance of drill sergeants borrowed from Regular regiments. Training was also held in 1853 and 1854.Army List, various dates.Walrond, pp. 331‚Äì3. Crimean War War having broken out with Russia in 1854 and an expeditionary force sent to the Crimea, the Militia were called out for home defence. The 1st Devon Militia was embodied on 18 December, consisting of 10 companies, 942 all ranks. The medically unfit men, together with married men with two or more children, were sent home and volunteers enlisted to replace them. The regiment was drilled into shape, and on 27 February 1855 went by rail to Bristol, where it boarded steamers for Newport, Wales. Here a problem arose: by one interpretation of the regulations none of the men enlisted before 12 May 1854 could be forced to do more than 56 days' service. Most of these had already been sent home in December, but there were still 117 serving in the regiment who refused to re-enlist under the later regulations, so the regiment lost many of its best men (the family men were also discharged). However, recruitment had been good, so most of the losses were made up. Two recruiting drives during the year for militiamen to transfer to the Regulars saw the loss of another 141 men from the regiment. On 21 December the regiment marched to Pontypool, where it boarded trains for Liverpool and embarked for Ireland, where it was stationed at Castle Barracks in Limerick. During the winter another 401 men volunteered for the Regulars, which severely reduced the strength of the regiment. The war having ended, the regiment left Limerick for Cork on 5 June 1856, and on 11 June embarked on the Germania steamer bound for Weymouth, Dorset. The ship was caught in fog while passing Land's End and was nearly lost on the rocks. Once it had landed at Weymouth it relieved an Irish militia regiment guarding Portland Harbour. After the presentation of new Regimental colours to the regiment it marched to Exeter on 18 July, arriving on 23 July. The order to disembody arrived the next day, and the process was concluded on 31 July.Walrond, pp. 336‚Äì58. Mid-Victorian era The 1st Devon Militia carried out its first peacetime training (21 days) in September 1858, and underwent 21 or 27 days in each of the following years, the Non-Commissioned Officers and recruits having undergone preliminary drill over the preceding 14 or 21 days. In November 1867 the permanent staff were called out to help deal with bread riots in Exeter, several times charging at the rioters with bayonets to disperse them. During the Fenian scare in 1867 the regiment posted guards over the military stores at Exeter. That year the Militia Reserve Act came into force, whereby in exchange for a bounty the militiamen could sign up for service with the Regulars in time of war; however, there was little take-up among the 1st Devons. In 1871 the Militia were permitted to camp for their annual training, but the 1st Devons' camp at Woodbury was cancelled after there was a case of Smallpox in the village. In 1872 it carried out its first camp since 1813, and the following year took part in division-scale manoeuvres at Roborough Down. However, the unpopularity of camps led to a falling-off in recruitment and the Devon Militia regiments were each reduced by two companies in 1876.Walrond, pp. 359‚Äì79. Under the 'Localisation of the Forces' scheme introduced by the Cardwell Reforms of 1872, Militia regiments were grouped into county brigades with their local Regular and Volunteer Force battalions. For the 1st Devon Regiment this was Brigade No 34 (County of Devon) in Western District alongside the 11th Foot, the South Devon Militia and the Exeter and South Devon Volunteers. The Militia were now controlled by the War Office rather than their county Lord Lieutenant, and officers' commissions were signed by the Queen.Hay, pp. 27, 158.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 195‚Äì6.Spiers, Late Victorian Army, pp. 4, 15, 19.Walrond, p. 372. A mobilisation scheme began to appear in the Army List from December 1875. This assigned to Militia units places in an order of battle serving with Regular units in an 'Active Army' and a 'Garrison Army'. The 1st and South Devon Militia were both assigned to the Garrison Army in the Plymouth defences. Devonshire Regiment The Childers Reforms of 1881 took Cardwell's reforms further, and the Militia regiments became integral parts of their Regular county regiment, with the 11th Foot becoming the Devonshire Regiment of two battalions and the two Devon Militia regiments becoming the 3rd and 4th battalions. This caused some confusion: because there had been no established order of precedence, when Militia regiments were brigaded together they had traditionally drawn lots for precedence in that year's camp; this became an annual ballot between the counties. Then in 1833 individual regiments were balloted for a permanent order of precedence and this list was continued in 1855: the 1st Devons were drawn as No 41, the South Devons as No 25. Normally this only affected matters such as positions on the parade ground, but when the militia became numbered battalions it meant that the South Devons (originally the 3rd, later 2nd) became the 3rd Battalion, Devonshire Regiment by virtue of their higher precedence, and the 1st Devons became the 4th Battalion (1st Devon Militia), Devonshire Regiment. However, the Devonshire Regiment did adopt the old East Devon Militia's cap badge and motto in 1883.W.Y. Baldry, 'Order of Precedence of Militia Regiments', Journal of the Society for Army Historical Research, Vol 15, No 57 (Spring 1936), pp. 5‚Äì16.Walrond, pp. 322, 384, 387. The battalion continued to do its annual training and target practice, being issued with the Martini‚ÄìHenry rifle in 1882. Like many Militia battalions, the 4th Devons volunteered for garrison service during the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882, but none were embodied. The Regular Reserves were called up when an international crisis arose in 1885 over the Panjdeh incident while much of the Regular Army was simultaneously engaged on the Nile Expedition; the acting CO offered the 4th Battalion for garrison duty, but this was politely declined. The Devonshire Militia battalions were further reduced in 1890, to an establishment of six companies. Walrond, pp. 377‚Äì406. Second Boer War With the bulk of the Regular Army serving in South Africa during the Second Boer War, the Militia were called out. The 4th Battalion was embodied from 11 May 1900 to 16 July 1901, serving in the garrison of the Channel Isles. A number of officers who served in the battalion in subsequent years had seen active service in the Boer War, including the CO, Lt-Col the Hon E.A. Palk, and Capt William Edwards, who had won a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in the Ashanti War before serving with the South African Constabulary. Special Reserve After the Boer War, the future of the Militia was called into question. There were moves to reform the Auxiliary Forces (Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers) to take their place in the six Army Corps proposed by St John Brodrick as Secretary of State for War. However, little of Brodrick's scheme was carried out.Dunlop, pp. 131‚Äì40, 158-62.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 243‚Äì2, 254. Under the sweeping Haldane Reforms of 1908, the Militia was replaced by the Special Reserve, a semi-professional force whose role was to provide reinforcement drafts for Regular units serving overseas in wartime (similar to the Militia Reserve of 1867).Dunlop, pp. 270‚Äì2.Spiers, Army & Society, pp. 275‚Äì7. Under these changes, the 3rd (2nd Devon Militia) Battalion was disbanded, and the 4th (1st Devon Militia) became the 3rd (Reserve) Battalion, Devonshire Regiment on 1 April 1908. The reformed battalion also had a cadet company at Dartmouth.Conrad, 1914. World War I and after When World War I broke out on 4 August 1914 the battalion was embodied at Exeter and moved to its war station at Plymouth on 8 August. It returned to Exeter on 28 August to fulfil its role of organising drafts of Special Reservists and returning Regular reservists for the 1st Battalion serving with the British Expeditionary Force. The battalion was soon overwhelmed by returning reservists and recruits flocking to enlist, and by the end of September 1914 it was three times its establishment strength. In May 1915 it moved to Devonport where it formed part of the Plymouth Garrison for the rest of the war, but its primary role was to train reinforcement drafts for the battalions serving overseas. In the course of the war the 3rd Devons trained and despatched 750 officers and over 13,000 other ranks.James, p. 54.3rd (Special Reserve) Bn in WWI at The Keep Military Museum. After the war, the remaining personnel were drafted to the 1st Battalion on 1 August 1919 and the 3rd Battalion was disembodied on 9 August. Although the Supplementary Reserve (renamed Militia again in 1921) remained in existence after 1919 and a small number of officers were commissioned, the infantry militia dwindled away: by the outbreak of World War II 3rd Bn Devonshires had no officers listed. The Militia was formally disbanded in April 1953. Commanders=Colonels The following served as Colonel of the Regiment from its re-establishment in 1758:Burke's. * John, 4th Duke of Bedford, assumed command 1758, died 1771 * John Dyke Acland, commissioned 1771, died 1778 * John, 4th Earl Poulett, commissioned 22 January 1779, resigned 1798 * John Pollexfen Bastard, promoted 8 November 1798, died 1816 * Hugh, 2nd Earl Fortescue, commissioned 20 May 1816, resigned 1855 Under the 1852 Militia Act the rank of colonel was abolished in the militia and the lieutenant-colonel became the commanding officer; at the same time, the position of Honorary Colonel was introduced. Lieutenant-Colonels Lieutenant-Colonels Commandant of the unit included the following:Devons at Infantry Battalion COs. * Hon John William Fortescue, MP, second son of 2nd Earl Fortescue, promoted 30 September 1853, resigned 1856 * Francis Edward Drewe, half-pay major, 23rd Foot, appointed 12 July 1856, resigned 1858 on returning to full pay; later major-general * John Davie Ferguson Davie, MP, retired captain, Grenadier Guards, appointed 1 November 1858, resigned 1867 * R.T.

Mountsteven, CMG was appointed. Uniforms and insignia The first pairs of Colours issued to the Devonshire Militia battalions in 1758 consisted of the Union flag for the King's Colour, and one bearing the Duke of Bedford's coat of arms for the Regimental Colour.Walrond, p. 33. The regimental badge of the 1st or East Devon Militia from the date of its formation was a heraldic castle (representing Exeter Castle) with the motto Semper fidelis (Ever faithful), allegedly to commemorate the defence of the city by the Trained Bands during the English Civil War. This badge was officially authorised by the Lord Lieutenant in 1860, and was adopted by the whole Devonshire Regiment in 1883.Walrond, pp. 362, 385‚Äì7. The uniform of the 1st or East Devon Militia in 1778 was red with yellow facings; some time between 1800 and 1803 the facings were changed to white, but in 1816 they charged back to yellow.Walrond, p. 310. When the Devonshires reverted to their pre-1881 Lincoln green facings in the early 1900s the militia battalions conformed.

He was the first chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Russian state and the second and last chairman of the Provisional Siberian government. Also was a mason.  Biography  Born into the family of a priest, Pyotr Vologodsky graduated in 1884 from Tomsk Men's Gymnasium, and later entered the law faculty of St. Petersburg University. He was expelled for \\"disreputable behaviour\\" in 1887 and sent to Tomsk. In 1892, he externally passed the exams for a course in the law faculty of Kharkiv University. From 1887 onwards he served in the judicial institutions of Tomsk, Barnaul, Verny, and Semipalatinsk. With the introduction of judicial charters in Siberia in 1897, he became a sworn attorney. In 1905, he acted as a lawyer during the political process of the demonstrations in Tomsk and as the prosecutor in the case of the pogrom in Tomsk in 1905. Pyotr Vologodsky took part in the creation of the Socialist Revolutionary Organization in Tomsk. He was a devoted activist throughout the regional movement. Further, he participated in the preparation of the draft of the \\"Basic Provisions of the Siberian Regional-Union\\" and in the work of his congress, the meetings of which were held at his house on August 28-29, 1905. In 1901-1917, he was a member of the Tomsk City Council. He was elected as a deputy to the Second State Duma from the Tomsk province according to the list of progressives but did not participate in its work, because the emperor managed to dissolve the Duma before Vologodsky arrived in the capital. Also, he was a member of the newspaper \\"Siberian Bulletin\\". He was the editor of the \\"Siberian Life\\" newspaper. In March 1917, Pyotr Vologodsky became one of three members of the provincial commissariat for the management of the Tomsk province, created after the removal from the office of Governor Vladimir Dubinsky. At the end of January 1918, at an illegal meeting of the Siberian Regional Duma, he was elected to the Provisional Government of Autonomous Siberia and was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. After the overthrow of Soviet power in Siberia on June 30, 1918, he headed the Provisional Siberian Government. After the creation of the Russian state, on November 4, 1918, the executive body of the Directory, the All-Russian Council of Ministers, was formed.

He resigned on November 18, 1918, after Admiral Kolchak came to power, but at the insistence of the right-wing public, he took the post of chairman of the Council of Ministers of Russia. In December 1918, in connection with the departure of Klyuchnikov, temporarily acted as Minister of Foreign Affairs. He resigned on November 22, 1919. By a resolution of the Administrative Council of the Provisional Siberian Government of November 3, 1918, Vologodsky was awarded the title of Honorary Citizen of Siberia. In the winter of 1919-1920, he emigrated to China. There, he served in a business partnership. In 1920, he was a member of the Committee of Representatives of the Russian population of Tianjin. Five years later, Vologodsky died on November 19, 1925, in the city of Harbin.

History Soldiers Memorial Hospital The first hospital in Middleton was established in a house in Lower Middleton in 1916. In 1917, larger facilities were required so the J. D. Mackenzie property on Main Street was acquired. This new facility was operated by Mrs. A. J. Banks. In 1920, the hospital was relocated to 22 Bridge Street and was operated by Miss Jessie Woodbury, R. N., of Kingston, Nova Scotia. It was soon realized that this hospital would be too small to provide the services needed and a movement was started by Dr. J. A. Sponagle, of Middleton, Nova Scotia, to secure larger and better facilities. Various groups were approached and, finally, the local War Veterans' Association consented to sponsor the new hospital. Dr. L. R. Morse of Lawrencetown was appointed Chairman of the project. In 1921, the F. E. Cox residence on Commercial Street was purchased, moved to Gates Avenue, and converted into a hospital. The first Soldiers' Memorial Hospital became a corporate body under the laws of the province of Nova Scotia. The Hospitals' Board of Management was formed to direct the overall planning and operations of the hospital. In 1946, the need for expansion was again experienced and it was decided to work towards the erection of a completely new and modern hospital. The present hospital site, at the east end of the town, was purchased in that year from Mrs. B. B. Gwillam. With the advent of a Provincial Hospitalization Program and the opportunity to receive Federal and Provincial Construction Grants, the construction of the new hospital began in 1960 and the hospital was officially opened in August 1961.https://www.saltwire.com/news/provincial/new-primary- health-care-clinic-opening-at-soldiers-memorial-next- week-393934/?location=nova-scotia  References External links *Nova Scotia Health Authority Category:Hospital buildings completed in 1921 Category:Hospitals established in 1921 Category:1921 establishments in Nova Scotia Category:1921 establishments in Canada Category:Hospitals in Nova Scotia ","title":"Soldiers Memorial Hospital"},{"id":"64205186","text":"The 1895 Kentucky gubernatorial election was held on November 5, 1895.

He has held numerous leadership positions in different organizations that are working to control HIV in Rwanda. Some of his work is concentrated on preventing mother to child transmission of HIV and in collaboration with Projet San Francisco, he has studied HIV in discordant couples.  Education  Karita earned his MD from the National University of Rwanda in Kigali, the capital of Rwanda. In 1995, he completed his master's degree in molecular biology at the University of Brussels in Belgium, studying with Peter Piot, and then a master of public health in epidemiology at the University of Alabama in Birmingham. He is currently affiliated with Emory University as the country director for Projet San Francisco in Rwanda.  Research and work = Earlier research on HIV  Karita has co-authored on numerous research papers that studied HIV infection and transmission in Rwanda. His work with Projet San Francisco, also called the Rwandan Zambia HIV Research Group (RZHRG), is focused on providing counseling and testing for discordant couples. The findings in some of the publications were used to suggest effective control programs in Rwanda. Project San Francisco was founded in Kigali in 1986, but when the Rwandan genocide began in 1994, many of the researchers relocated and began a clinic in Lusaka, Zambia. When Karita returned to Rwanda after the genocide, he became the founding director of the National Reference Laboratory for Retroviral Infectionsand was named the head of Rwanda's National AIDS Control Program. The Rwandan genocide was accompanied by the rape of thousands of women and the spread of HIV to them, leading to many who were unable to afford treatment. Karita was also the first Technical Advisor in Rwanda for the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation (EGPAF), which is an organization aiming to end AIDS among children and prevent mother to child transmission. The EGPAF ended their partnership with the Ministry of Health in Rwanda in 2019 because of the reduction of mother to child transmission in the country.  Recent work  Karita has been the principal investigator for recent HIV vaccination clinical trials in Rwanda for the past few years. One research article that he published analyzed how HIV health care has improved since the genocide. In 2017, he was one of the recipients for the SANTHE (the Sub-Saharan African Network for TB/HIV Research Excellence) grants for his research on HIV among high-risk populations, such as female sex workers. He is also on the Consortium Steering Committee and a site Principal Investigator for SANTHE . Karita was co-chair of the scientific programme committee at the International Conference on AIDS and STIs in Africa (ICASA) in 2019, which is a conference where scientists share their research and expertise. The past few years, Karita has been working on the Umurinzi Ebola Vaccination Program to prevent the spread of Ebola, but the vaccinations were paused in 2020 while the government's main focus was on COVID-19.

For seven years he was taught by Professor Bruckner, who hid his support of French Revolutionary ideas from his pupil. He was also taught religion by Mikhail Speransky, who remained his friend and adviser for the rest of his life. In 1799, aged 15, he became a junker at the Collegium of Foreign Affairs, becoming chamberlain in 1804. Marriage Portrait of Elizaveta Borisovna Golicyna by Aleksandr Grigor'eviƒç Varnek, 1810.

The marriage was not entirely successful. The princess was religious and not only converted to Catholicism, but also severely burned her hand in a brazier during a moment of religious exaltation, leading to its amputation, and finally went insane. Later career In 1809 he was sent to review the Volga provinces and the following year his father (then Russian ambassador in Paris) invited him to carry congratulations to Napoleon on his marriage to Marie-Louise of Austria. After his return to Russia he served in the Finance Ministry, but gained no promotion for the following eleven years, leading him to the conclusion that gossip had turned the Tsar against him. –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø–æ—Ä—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç—ã XVIII‚ÄîXIX —Å—Ç–æ–ª–µ—Ç–∏–π. –ò–∑–¥. –í–µ–ª. –ö–Ω. –ù–∏–∫–æ–ª–∞—è –ú–∏—Ö–∞–π–ª–æ–≤–∏—á–∞. ‚Äî –°–ü–±., 1906. ‚Äî –¢.

On 13 January 1822 he was made a senator with the rank of privy counsellor, becoming noted for his independence in resolving cases, sharp judgements, direct and firm convictions, integrity and honesty, all of which earned him the Tsar's favour. In 1826 he was appointed to the Supreme Criminal Court to hear the Decembrists case and the following year was entrusted with an audit of Western Siberia. He finally retired in 1833. As the only male survivor of the Kurakin family, he had inherited several estates. At one of his favourites, the Stepanovsky estate in the Tver province, he carried out extensive construction work, building a whole town near the house with a theatre, tower, obelisks, gates, streets and avenues, in which he settled people.

The award was made for his actions during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, when he displayed exemplary courage and outstanding leadership while commanding the 21st Battalion, Punjab Regiment, in a successful assault on a fortified Pakistani position near the Poonch River in the Jammu and Kashmir sector of the Western Front. He retired from the army in 1977 as a brigadier, after which he was the chief managing director of the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative. He died in a vehicle accident in December 2011. Early life and family Rattan Nath Sharma was born on 23 November 1926 in Kangra, in the British province of Punjab, the son of Shri Hari Charan Dixit. Prior to joining the Indian Army he attended the D.S.V.High School in Kangra. After finishing school, he briefly worked for the Indian Revenue Service but left after six months when a man tried to bribe him. He was married to Subhash and they had two daughters and one son: Meera, born in 1960; Anita, born in 1963; and Sandeep, born in 1969. Military career Sharma was commissioned into the Punjab Regiment on 28 August 1949, and was mentioned in dispatches for his performance during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. By the time of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, Sharma was a lieutenant colonel, and was commanding officer of the 21st Battalion, Punjab Regiment in the Poonch area in the Jammu and Kashmir sector of the Western Front. On 9 December 1971, Sharma's battalion was tasked with capturing a fortified Pakistan Army position named Nangi Tekri, overlooking the Poonch River. The Pakistani positions were strongly held, dispersed and mutually supporting, but the capture of them was considered critical as they dominated the river and nearby roads. The assault began the next day, and was met by intense artillery and small arms fire, which slowed progress and caused heavy casualties. Despite this, Sharma encouraged his men to press on, leading them from the front throughout with complete disregard for his personal safety. Over the next two days, the battalion made progress under his cool leadership, and the position was finally captured in fierce hand-to-hand fighting on 12 December. The Pakistani defenders suffered 13 killed, three wounded and one captured in the battle. For his exemplary courage and outstanding leadership during this operation, the Indian government awarded Sharma the Maha Vir Chakra, the second-highest award for gallantry available to members of the Indian Armed Forces. The award was promulgated on Independence Day in 1972. Later life Sharma rose to the rank of brigadier before his retirement from the army in 1977, after which he was the chief managing director of the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative. He lived in Palampur, Himachal Pradesh, and after his retirement from the Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative he worked for social causes, particularly looking after ex-soldiers and the poor. He died on 24 December 2011, as a result of being struck by a speeding vehicle while waiting for a bus. He was cremated with full military honours at his home village of Ghugar.

A unit from the Israeli Navy‚Äôs special operation unit, Shayetet 13, on mission in South Lebanon in 1997, stumbled into a deadly ambush by Islamic Resistance guerrillas. Twelve Israeli soldiers were killed, which was the worst Israeli single-day casualty toll in Lebanon since 1985.  Background  On the night of August 3, 1997 an Israeli unit from the Golani Brigade's Reconnaissance Battalion was brought by helicopter to a valley a few kilometres northwest of Nabatiya, outside the Israeli Security Zone in South Lebanon. The force made it to the village of Kfour and planted explosives in a wall outside the home of Hussein Qassir, a local Islamic Resistance commander. The Israelis were detected during the retreat and a firefight broke out, but they were successfully evacuated by helicopter. In the morning Islamic Resistance patrols searched the village for road-side bombs left by the Israelis. When a group of Lebanese fighters passed by the wall, the explosives were detonated by a signal from an Israeli UAV drone. Hussein Qassir and Sheikh Taysir Badran, the Islamic Resistance commander in the nearby town of Nabatiya, and three other Islamic Resistance combatants were killed.Blanford 2011, p. 181-82  The Ambush  About a month after the Kfour attack the Islamic Resistance received indications that Israel was planning a similar attack around Ansariya , a Lebanese coastal village between Tyre and Sidon. It was therefore decided to attempt to ambush the Israeli force that was going to plant the explosive device. The operation was meticulously planned by Islamic Resistance commander Mustafa Badreddine, who would later replace Imad Mughniyah as top military commander of the Islamic Resistance. The precise target of the Israeli operation was never clarified. Ronen Bergman claims that the target was Haldoun Haidar, a local Hezbullah commander, who was described by responsible officers at the IDF Northern Command as \\"minor and insignificant\\".Bergman 2018, p. 467 The Islamic Resistance, however, understood both where the Israelis would land and the approximate route they would then take. The Israelis would arrive from the sea and walk a few kilometres through citrus plantations towards the target. The Islamic Resistance would plant explosives on the likely route. They had, however, no indication of when Israel would strike, which was a problem because during the daytime the citrus groves were tended to by the local farmers. This meant that the area could not be mined during hours of daylight for fear of harming the farmers. The explosives therefore had to placed each evening after sunset and removed each morning before daybreak. Another problem was that the area around Ansariya was a weak spot for Hizbullah and dominated by AMAL, a rival Shiite movement. It was therefore deemed necessary to contact the local AMAL leadership and warn them about the impending operation. AMAL accepted and even offered to provide a back-up unit for the operation.Blanford 2011, p. 187-88 The Islamic Resistance ambush unit consisted of 20 fighters from the local militia, led by the local commander Abu Shamran.Blanford 2011, p. 187 In the evening of 4 September 1997, a force of 16 commandos from the Israeli Navy‚Äôs special operations unit Shayetet 13 walked ashore on an uninhabited stretch of the south Lebanese coastline. It was commanded by Lt. Col. Yosef Korakin. The unit crossed the coastal road and walked through the plantations until it reached an orchard, covered by a wall. When the unit tried to open an iron gate two Claymore type anti-personal explosives, spraying metal marbles, were exploded in quick succession. At the same time the Lebanese fighters opened fire on the Israelis, triggering the explosives carried by one of the soldiers. In a matter of minutes, eleven of the Israelis, including the commander, were dead and four of them wounded. Only the radioman escaped unhurt and he desperately radioed for support and evacuation.Blanford 2011, p. 187-89 Israeli Cobra helicopters quickly opened fire with TOW antitank missiles and 20 mm chain guns, creating a perimeter of fire for the rescue helicopters. The Islamic Resistance fighters decided to pull back after two of them were wounded. Blanford 2011, p. 190 The AMAL fighters opened fire on the Israelis, with rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, before pulling back themselves. The Lebanese fighters continued however firing mortar shells on the Israelis, killing Captain Dagesh Maher, a Druze military doctor from the rescuing team. More than four hours after the fighting began the last Israeli helicopter took off with its cargo of wounded and dead soldiers. Despite frantic searches, one of the soldiers remained missing. It was Itamar Ilya, who was blown literally to pieces when the explosives he was carrying were detonated.  Aftermath  The catastrophe at Ansariya created a lot of unease in Israel. A total of five officers and seven other soldiers were killed in the clash. It was the worst single-day casualty toll in Lebanon since the Israeli withdrawal to the security zone in 1985. Shayetet 13 had for a long time avoided casualties. It would take the unit two years to recuperate from this blow. Prime Minister Netanyahu called it \\"one of the worst tragedies that has ever occurred to us\\".Blanford 2011, p. 193 On May 25, 1998, the remains of Itamar Ilyah as well as body parts of at least two other soldiers who died in the Ansariya ambush were exchanged for 65 Lebanese prisoners and the bodies of 40 Hizbullah fighters and Lebanese soldiers captured by Israel. Among those returned to Lebanon, were the remains of Hadi Nasrallah, the son of Hizbullah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in a clash with IDF a week after the Ansariya ambush. Possible security leak There was a wide-spread feeling in Israel that the Ansariya operation had been compromised. But the head of the Israeli Military Intelligence Directorate (AMAN) Moshe Ya'alon decided early on that the initial explosion must have come from the explosives carried by the Israelis. It was thus not a planned ambush but rather a stroke of bad luck for Israel. Hizbullah had no prior knowledge of the operation and therefore no security leak in Israel was suspected. A commission of Inquiry was appointed. It determined that most of the Israeli casualties were harmed by a different type of explosive, containing metal marbles. The commission, however, ruled out the possibility of a security leak in Israel. The ambush was unplanned and not based on intelligence that Hizbullah had obtained. This conclusion was also confirmed by two other subsequent investigations. On the first anniversary of the ambush, Hizbullah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah declared: ‚ÄúAll I can say now is that we knew beforehand that there was going to be an operation‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúNow the question is: If the resistance knew, who told them? But we can‚Äôt disclose that, because that won‚Äôt be in the resistance‚Äôs best interest.‚Äù Blanford 2011, p. 194 At first the focus was about a possible double agent, giving away the Israeli plans to Hizbullah. This version was voiced by The Independent's Beirut correspondent Robert Fisk. An Israeli agent was turned, who disclosed Israeli plans and fed Israel false information. Bergman also claims that double agents in the SLA intelligence outfit played a role in the affair.Bergman 2018, p. 468 In August 2010 Nasrallah revealed that Hizbullah had long been able to download the videos taken by Israeli drones overflying Lebanon. In August 1997 Hizbullah operatives noticed an Israeli interest in the area around Ansariya and concluded that they were planning a Kfour-type operation in the area. Israeli drones returned several times to the area and seemed to be following a path from the beach, through the plantations to a place north of Ansariya. These revelations caused to an uproar in Israel. The IDF Chief of Staff Gabi Ashkenazi appointed a fourth commission of inquiry, headed by Col. (res.) Kobi Agmon, to examine whether the videos Hizbullah released were authentic. The commission‚Äôs conclusion was that the videos were indeed genuine and that Hizbullah had somehow succeeded in downloading the transmissions from the drones. Some of the footage released by Hizbullah was even taken during the actual operation. Hizbullah could apparently follow the Israeli troop movements on the ground, in real time, during the whole operation and the rescue effort. It was apparent that Israel had seriously underestimated Hizbullah technical capabilities. But the conclusions of the fourth commission of inquiry was not made public. It was first revealed by the Israeli news site Ynet in 2017, 20 years after the incident. Blanford 2011, p. 189-96 After these revelations the IDF started to encrypt video transmissions from drones.

As a senior, Ehmann spent the year in contention for the Big Ten scoring title as he upped his average to 23.9 points per game. He was recognized as a first-team All-Big Ten performer and earned a spot on Look Magazine's 10-man All-American team. Ehmann left Northwestern as the school's all-time leading scorer for a career (1,291), season (501 his senior year) and single-game (38) ‚Äì all since broken.

It is situated within North Cascades National Park and Stephen Mather Wilderness. The nearest higher neighbor is Mount Prophet, to the northwest. Like many North Cascade peaks, Genesis Peak is more notable for its large, steep rise above local terrain than for its absolute elevation. Topographic relief is significant since the southern aspect of the mountain rises 5,400 feet above the Big Beaver Valley in approximately , and the eastern aspect of the mountain rises 5,600 feet above Ross Lake in approximately . Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into Ross Lake via Skymo, No Name, and Big Beaver Creeks. The first ascent of this peak was made September 13, 1975, by Norman Burke, Cliff Lawson, Ed Lebert, and Dan Sjolseth. Climate Genesis Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology Left to right: Mt. Prophet, Genesis, and Chaos seen from North Cascades Highway The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

The portion of the line in Alabama was first owned by the Alabama and Florida Rail Road Company (of Alabama), while the portion of the line in Florida was owned by the Alabama and Florida Railroad (of Florida).  First attempt (1834‚Äì1838)  Citizens of Pensacola, led by William Chase, a captain in the United States Army Corps of Engineers, developed a plan to construct a railroad from Pensacola to the interior of Alabama in the early 1830s. The Florida, Alabama and Georgia Rail Road was chartered by the Florida Territory in February 1834 to build a railroad from Pensacola to the border with Alabama. In December 1834, Alabama chartered the Alabama, Florida and Georgia Rail Road to connect the Florida railroad with Columbus, Georgia. The next year, Florida rescinded the charter for the Florida, Alabama and Georgia Rail Road, and accepted the Alabama chartered Alabama, Florida and Georgia Rail Road as the operator of the proposed line from Pensacola to Columbus, with William Chase as president of the company. Funds were raised with the sale of stock and of bonds issued by the Bank of Pensacola and guaranteed by the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida, and a roadbed was graded and trestles built from Pensacola to the Escambia River. Strap rail and freight and passenger cars were ordered. The Bank of Pensacola closed during the Panic of 1837. The railroad company managed to obtain some further loans, and sold off much of the equipment it purchased earlier to raise funds. To shorten to length of the railroad, and reduce construction costs, the plan was changed to connect to Montgomery rather than Columbus, but work on the railroad ended in 1838. The Bank of Pensacola failed to pay the interest on the bonds due in 1840, and the Territorial Council repudiated its backing of the bonds.  Two companies  The project for a rail link between Pensacola and Montgomery was revived in the early 1850s. Alabama chartered the Alabama and Florida Rail Road Company (of Alabama) to build a railroad between what became known as Pollard, Alabama (just north of the Alabama-Florida state line) and Montgomery, with Charles T. Pollard as president. In 1853, Florida chartered its own Alabama and Florida Railroad (of Florida), with William Chase as president, to build a railroad from Pensacola to Pollard. Construction on the Florida portion of the line began in Pensacola in 1856 and reached Pollard in 1861. The Alabama portion of the railroad reached Montgomery in May 1861, and through passenger service (a ten-hour trip) was instituted between Montgomery and Pensacola. The Alabama & Florida Railroad used five-foot gauge tracks. Construction of the rail lines had been financed, in part, by sales of land granted to the rail companies by the Federal government under the Land Grant Act of 1850. The A & F RR (of Alabama) received almost from the Federal government, and the A & F RR (of Florida) received almost .  After the Civil War  The Alabama and Florida Railroad suffered severe damage during the Civil War. Most of the rail on the Florida portion of the line was removed, and the engines and rolling stock belonging to the A & F RR (of Florida) were seized by the Confederate government and turned over to the A & F RR (of Alabama) and the Mobile and Great Northern Railroad. The Florida legislature chartered the Pensacola and Louisville Railroad Company in July 1868 to replace the Alabama and Florida Railroad (of Florida). The new company completely rebuilt the line from Pensacola to Pollard. The Pensacola Railroad Company purchased the Pensacola & Louisville RR in 1878, and it in turn was taken over by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad in 1880. The Alabama and Florida Railroad (of Alabama) and the Mobile and Great Northern Railroad were merged in 1868 to form the Montgomery and Mobile Railroad.

Handala became the signature of Naji al-Ali's cartoons and remains an iconic symbol of Palestinian identity and defiance. The character has been described as \\"portraying war, resistance, and the Palestinian identity with astounding clarity\\".Gandolfo, 2010, p.60 The name comes from Citrullus colocynthis (), a perennial plant local to the region of Palestine which bears a bitter fruit, grows back when cut and has deep roots.Oweis, 2004: \\"The handhal is a resilient plant that has deep roots and the ability to grow back regardless of attempts to cut or weed it out. It is always associated with bitterness and thus bitterness and resilience became common features of Handala.\\" Handala's impact has continued in the decades after al-Ali's 1987 assassination; today the character remains widely popular as a representative of the Palestinian people, and is found on numerous walls and buildings throughout the West Bank (notably on the Israeli West Bank barrier), Gaza and other Palestinian refugee camps, and as a popular tattoo and jewellery motif. It has also been used by movements such as Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions and the Iranian Green Movement.Oweis, 2004: \\"On the walls of occupied Palestine, in protests and demonstrations all over the world, Handala has become a symbol of Palestinian struggle and resistance. He is a representative of the refugees and their right of return to their homeland. A group of Palestinians created a network called \\"Handala Palestine\\" and adopted the name of Handala as a symbol for educating others about the injustice that has been committed against the Palestinians. Handala has also become a symbol for the campaign to boycott Israeli products. He appears as the logo of various human rights organizations and media groups. He can be found as a tattoo on the bodies of thousands of people, and as a gold or silver pendant hanging around the necks of millions. Handala, crafted from the wood of olive-trees uprooted by Israel, can also be found in souvenir shops all over Palestine.\\" Early publication Handala appeared for the first time in Al-Seyassah in Kuwait on 13 July 1969, and first turned his back to the viewer and clasped his hands behind his back from 1973 onwards. Symbolism Handala's age ‚Äì ten-years-old ‚Äì represents Naji al-Ali's age in 1948 when he was forced to leave Palestine and would not grow up until he could return to his homeland: Al-Ali wrote that: > Handala was born 10 years old and he will always be 10 years old. It was at > that age that I left my homeland. When Handala returns, he will still be 10 > years old, and then he will start growing up. His posture, with his turned back and clasped hands symbolise the character's \\"rejection at a time when solutions are presented to us the American way\\" and as \\"a symbol of rejection of all the present negative tides in our region.\\"Owais, 2004 Handala's ragged clothes and standing barefoot symbolise his allegiance to the poor.Owais, 2004 Al-Ali described Handala as \\"the symbol of a just cause: > He was the arrow of the compass, pointing steadily towards Palestine.

It was founded to advocate for the moral, economic, and intellectual development of the Indian Christian community. The All India Conference of Indian Christians held its first meeting on 28 December 1914 and was led by Raja Sir Harnam Singh of Kapurthala, who was the president of the National Missionary Society (NMS); the first AICIC General Secretary was B.L. Rallia Ram of Lahore. Its creation united local and regional Indian Christian Associations, which existed in Bombay, Madras, Hyderabad, Punjab, United Provinces, Bengal and Burma, under one umbrella organisation. At the time of the Indian independence movement, the organisation allied itself with the Indian National Congress and the resolutions passed by All India Conference of Indian Christians advocated communal harmony, while also pressing for the rights of Christians in both colonial India and independent India. The India Conference of Indian Christians advocated for self-rule in a united and independent country, opposing the partition of India. During the era of the British Raj in India, the AICIC served as the mouthpiece for members of the Indian Christian community, conducting membership drives to boost its base, which included Protestant and Catholic Christians. As such, the presidents of the AICIC represented the Christians of undivided India at the Round Table Conferences.  History = Colonial India  K.T. Paul of Salem became the president of the All India Conference of Indian Christians in 1923, representing the Christian community of Undivided India at the Second Round Table Conference. The All India Conference of Indian Christians played an important role in the Indian independence movement, advocating for self-rule of the country by Indians and opposing the partition of India. In its early stages of the nationalist movement in colonial India, Indian Christians were heavily involved in the Indian National Congress and wider Indian independence movement: In 1916, Indian Christians as a whole appreciated the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, who placed an emphasis on nonviolence and communal harmony, which reassured Christians of a secure future in an independent India. In 1923, a large conference of Indian Christians assembled in Ranchi, located in the Bihar and Orissa Province of colonial India, where they resolved that \\"Swaraj [freedom], Nationalism, or self-determination helps the Self- realisation of a people and is consistent with the Christian religion and helpful to the Christian life.\\" The meeting of the All India Conference of Indian Christians in Lahore in December 1922, which had a large attendance of Punjabis, resolved that the clergymen of the Church in India should be drawn from the ranks of Indians, rather than foreigners. The AICIC also stated that Indian Christians would not tolerate any discrimination based on race or skin colour. The All India Conference of Indian Christians met in 1922 in Lucknow, acknowledging those Christians who were imprisoned as a result of their participation in the nationalist movement. In 1923, K. T. Paul from Salem became the president of the All India Conference of Indian Christians; he brought with him a rejection of racism, opposition to foreign missionary control, a service orientation, and a friendly approach towards people of other faiths. Paul represented Indian Christians in the First Round Table Conference in London. Following his death, Gandhi praised Paul for his nationalism; S. K. Datta of Lahore, who served as the principal of Forman Christian College, replaced K. T. Paul and shared Mahatma Gandhi's views on minorities and Depressed Classes. In 1927, leaders of the All India Conference of Indian Christians, including both Roman Catholics and Protestants, advocated the notion that Christians \\"should participate as common citizens in one common, national political system\\", rather than pressing for separate electorates. In 1928, as a part of the All Parties Conference, the All-India Conference of Indian Christians met in Lucknow with other Indian political organisations to draft the Nehru Report, which was an early version of the Constitution of India. E.C. Dewick, a Christian missionary from Great Britain, commented on the role of Indian Christians in the Indian independence movement: Indian Christians thus saw themselves as being able to contribute to the Indian nation, not only in terms of educational and welfare projects, but to mediate disputes between different parties in the country. In 1932, Aloysius Soares promoted the concept in the Catholic journal Week that minority communities should be protected in the Constitution of India and bill of rights. Catholic and Protestant leaders met in Poona in October 1932 and endorsed this, approving Soares' Fundamental Rights, which began: \\"Every person in the Indian Federation or Commonwealth shall be free to profess and practise his religion, including the right to make conversions, and, subject to public order and morality, exercise acts of public worship.\\" This was incorporated into the Indian Constitution in 1950. P. Chenchiah and other Indian Christian leaders saw the interests of Christians, Hindus and Muslims as being the same, holding that \\"a stronger sense of national identity, far from threatening the sense of religious identity, could be seen as enriching and complementary, and as providing further outlets for good will and collaboration in the newly emerging and all-embracing nation state.\\" On 30 October 1945, the All India Conference of Indian Christians formed a joint committee with the Catholic Union of India to form a joint committee that passed a resolution in which, \\"in the future constitution of India, the profession, practice and propagation of religion should be guaranteed and that a change of religion should not involve any civil or political disability.\\" This joint committee enabled the Christians in India to stand united, and in front of the British Parliamentary Delegation \\"the committee members unanimously supported the move for independence and expressed complete confidence in the future of the community in India.\\" The office for this joint committee was opened in Delhi, in which the Vice-Chancellor of Andhra University M. Rahnasamy served as President and B.L. Rallia Ram of Lahore served as General Secretary. Six members of the joint committee were elected to the Minorities Committee of the Constituent Assembly of India. In its meeting on 16 April 1947 and 17 April 1947, the joint committee of the All India Conference of Indian Christians and All India Catholic Union prepared a 13 point memorandum that was sent to the Constituent Assembly, which asked for religious freedom for both organisations and individuals; this came to be reflected in the Constitution of India. The All India Conference of Indian Christians opposed the partition of India and the creation of a separate Muslim state. On 24 March 1947 and 25 March 1947, the Honourable Dr. John Mathai, a member of the interim government, presided over the 27th session of the All India Conference of Indian Christians, with national leaders including Jawaharlal Nehru, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, Sarojini Naidu and B. G. Kher delivering speeches. The nationalist movement in India gave impetus to the ecumenical movement in India, which eventually resulted in the creation of united Protestant Churches after independence, such as the Church of South India. This is because Indian Christians were concerned more with \\"their economic survival, social status, or relations with non-Christian neighbours\\" rather than Christian denominational divisions.  Independent India  From 1953 to 1963, Y. Santram served as the General Secretary of the All India Conference of Indian Christians. The subsequent General Secretary of the organisation was David Shaw, a former member of the Bombay Legislative Council.

It was the middle of three works the artist produced for the Augustinian monastery church of San Gallo in Florence, between Noli me tangere and The Disputation on the Trinity, as recorded in the Anonimo Magliabechiano manuscript and in Vasari's Lives of the Artists. When Florence was besieged, that monastery's goods were moved to San Jacopo tra i Fossi within the city walls and its buildings razed in 1531 by Charles V's troops. The monastery rebuilt all its chapels at its new site in their former form. About a third of the painting was submerged in the 1557 flood, probably leading to the loss of the predella, though in 1986 (Serena?) Padovani theorised that that predella wholly or partly survived and is now divided up between the National Gallery of Ireland and Warwick Castle. Stylistically its monumental figures show the influence of Fra Bartolomeo and the , both major influences on Andrea del Sarto's early career, whilst the colouring is heavily influenced by Leonardo da Vinci and the compositional liberty by Piero di Cosimo. In 1985 Petrioli Tofani argued the figures standing on the balcony in the background to be Susannah and the Elders, with Conti arguing instead in 1968 that they are David and Bathsheba and Natali in 1989 that they are Adam and Eve, in reference to Augustinian exegesis.

Biography  Gottlieb grew up in the Los Angeles area, later moving to Northern California. In 1973, he earned a master's degree in mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley. Settling in the town of Albany, he taught high school mathematics in the East Bay for 37 years.  Amateur astronomy  Gottlieb began systematically observing Messier objects in 1977, using a 6-inch reflecting telescope. He employed many different scopes over the years, observing from dark sky sites near the San Francisco Bay Area, the Sierra Nevada foothills and star party events in California and elsewhere. By 2017, he had logged all 7,840 entries of the NGC Catalogue, completing the list after several visits to the southern hemisphere. His resulting compendium of observing reports has become a valuable resource for amateur astronomers. Gottlieb describes himself as a \\"hardcore visual observer\\", having never developed an interest in astrophotography. For him, \\"it's always been about the aesthetics at the eyepiece in a large scope\\". Currently his main telescope is a 24-inch StarStructure Dobsonian with computerized GoTo system.  NGC/IC Project  As Gottlieb's interests developed, he researched at the nearby UC Berkeley astronomy library, comparing his observations with those of professionals and with the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey. While so doing he discovered numerous errors and conflicting data, so began corresponding with other astronomers including Dr. Harold Corwin of the University of Texas. Gottlieb thus became one of the principal investigators of the NGC/IC Project, a collaboration among professional and amateur astronomers to identify and image objects, compile historical observations and correct mistakes in the NGC and IC catalogues. While helping to put the catalogues in order, he also worked with various telescope makers to correct the databases of computerized DSCs (digital setting circles) and GoTo systems. Later he gathered the list of objects and wrote descriptions for the \\"DeepMap 600\\", a popular folding star chart.  Astronomy writer, public lecturer  In the 1980s Gottlieb began writing articles for astronomy magazines about observing galaxy groups, various types of nebulae, supernova remnants and other topics. He is a Contributing editor for Sky and Telescope magazine, and his observing articles are often featured in the \\"Going Deep\\" column. Gottlieb promotes visual observing through public lectures for astronomy and science groups in Northern California and elsewhere.

The law had been used to catch runaway slaves in the 19th century, and was supported by CPOA. In October 2019, Newsom signed a bill, AB 1215, which bans law enforcement from using facial recognition technology on body cameras.

The Indian Council of Medical Research established the CTRI on 20 July 2007. Since 2009 the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization has mandated that anyone conducting clinical trials in India must preregister before enrolling any research participants. History In 2004 the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors published the ICMJE recommendations, which advocated that medical journals only publish clinical research if the researchers have registered it. This statement had global influence and started conversations about clinical trial registration in India. The Indian Council of Medical Research established the CTRI on 20 July 2007. By the end of 2007 the registry indexed 31 trials. In February 2008 various editors of medical journals in India pledged to avoid publishing articles about any clinical trial in India which was not registered. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation made trial registration mandatory on 15 June 2009. The rule was that researchers must preregister trials before the enrollment of any research participants. In April 2018 the CTRI reiterated this rule, saying that there had been a practice of starting clinical trials and enrolling patients without registering the trial. There had been past calls for preregistration. Data collected The CTRI requests all the information which the World Health Organization recommends for clinical trial registries. Additionally, the CTRI collects information specific to the circumstances of India, including the address of the principal investigator, the name of the ethics committee overseeing the trial and confirmation of their government registration; proof of permission from the Drugs Controller General of India, the expected end date of the trial; all study sites; and the method of randomizing participants and the allocation concealment. The World Health Organization Registry for clinical trials helped make the Indian registry more effective. A review of the registry recommended that researchers who are wondering whether to register their research should resolve their concern by attempting to register in CTRI. A 2019 evaluation reported that the registry improves the national quality of clinical trials in India but also that the registry itself would benefit from development to ensure more accurate data. One factor which introduced error into the registry include that users register their own trials, sometimes with misunderstanding or errors in their submissions. Another factor is that the registration form itself lacks the precision which researchers would typically want, and for example, the \\"type of study\\" field is recording unclear responses. Research A 2016 report found that the number of trials registered had been increasing for the past few years, with most of the increased registration being from individual investigators and students rather than pharmaceutical industry. A 2018 paper expressed that the CTRI had the benefit of preventing selective reporting of results and duplication of research. It also empowered patients and the public and informed ethics committees to and researchers about current and past trials.

Set during the 1930s, where ships at The Bahamas mysteriously disappeared, players assume the role of U.S. Marine pilots taking control of biplanes in a reconnaissance assignment at \\"Greenhell Isle\\", a fictional island inhabited by dinosaurs and creatures thought to be extinct. Headed by a director under the pseudonym of \\"Yah!\\", the game was developed by most of the same team that would later work on several projects for the Neo Geo platforms at SNK. Although first launched in arcades, the title has since been re-released through download services and compilations for various consoles. It received positive reception since its initial arcade release from critics who praised the visuals, sound design, gameplay and originality. A sequel, Prehistoric Isle 2, was released in 1999 for the Neo Geo MVS but garnered less success than its predecessor.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Prehistoric Isle is a scrolling shoot 'em up game reminiscent of R-Type where players assume the role of U.S. Marine pilots taking control of biplanes, which are sent on a reconnaissance assignment through five increasingly difficult stages at \\"Greenhell Isle\\", a fictional island inhabited by dinosaurs and creatures thought to be extinct.Prehistoric Isle arcade flyer (SNK, EU) The players control their plane over a constantly scrolling background and the scenery never stops moving until a boss that must be fought before progressing any further is reached. Players have only one weapon at their disposal: the standard shot that travels a max distance of the screen's length. A unique gameplay feature is the satellite \\"option\\"; when collecting a \\"P\\" icon by destroying dinosaur eggs, the players gain a satellite \\"option\\" similar to R-Type, which fires multiple types of weapons depending on its current stoptrack position. Various other items can also be picked up along the way such as speed increasers and \\"$\\" icons for points. If the player's plane is hit by enemies, enemy fire or enough neanderthals climb onto the plane, a life is lost but they will be respawned with the penalty of decreasing the plane's firepower to its original state.  Synopsis  In the 1930s, ships that sailed near The Bahamas began to disappear mysteriously, with the United States and neighbor countries deciding to task an investigation team from the U.S. Marine to determine the cause. When surveying the ocean, the expedition crew comes across an uncharted land dubbed \\"Greenhell Isle\\" and launches two reconnaissance biplanes to examine further. During their research, the biplanes come under attack by dinosaurs and creatures thought to be extinct.  Development and release  Prehistoric Isle was created by most of the same team that would later work on several projects for the Neo Geo platforms at SNK. Its development was helmed by a director under the pseudonym of \\"Yah!\\", with Eikichi Kawasaki serving as producer. The coding work was handled by two programmers under the pseudonyms of Itsam Matarca and Takoguti Kamen 001 respectively. Hideki Fujiwara, Violetche Nakamoto, Tomomi M. and \\"Yokochan\\" acted as the project's designers. The soundtrack was co-written by Shinsekai Gakkyoku Zatsugidan composers Toshikazu Tanaka and Yoko Osaka, with Tanaka writing the names of each music track. Prehistoric Isle was first released in arcades across Japan, North America and Europe by SNK in 1989. Prior to launch, it was showcased in a playable state at the 1989 AOU Show. On September 21, 1989, an album containing its soundtrack was co-published exclusively in Japan by Scitron and Pony Canyon. The game was first re-released by SNK Playmore in Japan as part of the SNK Arcade Classics 0 compilation for PlayStation Portable in 2011. Later during the same year, the title was later ported to PlayStation Network by G1M2. It was also included as part of the SNK 40th Anniversary Collection compilation.  Reception  Prehistoric Isle was met with positive reception since its initial launch in arcades. In Japan, Game Machine listed it on their July 1, 1989 issue as being the sixth most-successful table arcade unit of the year, outperforming titles such as Arbalester, Crack Down and Dynasty Wars.  Sequel  A sequel to Prehistoric Isle had already been teased during its credits sequence. The sequel, Prehistoric Isle 2, was released in 1999 for the Neo Geo MVS but proved to be less popular than its predecessor. It was later re-released in recent years for the PlayStation Network, Nintendo eShop and Xbox Live.

The vehicle-accessible and pedestrian-oriented center contains a mix of retailers and restaurants, an AMC movie theater, luxury residences and free parking (lot and garage). South Bay, Boston, is surrounded by the Polish Triangle, Upham's Corner, the South End, and South Boston. Begun strictly as a strip-mall shopping center in 1998, South Bay, Boston, was proposed in 2015 that a major expansion would result in construction of several six-story buildings containing up to 500 apartments, 200 hotel rooms, a cinema, and stores. Public officials from Dorchester said in 2015 they looked forward to a thorough community review of the plans and that the project appeared to present an exciting opportunity for the neighborhood. However, Councilor Frank Baker had large concerns for neighbors regarding managing traffic around the expanded complex. District Avenue, within South Bay, Boston, Massachusetts, USA History South Bay, Boston, began as a suburban-style strip mall, with South Carolina-based Edens, the developer, having bought the center in 1998 and expanded it eight years later. In 2015, Edens announced plans for implementation of a new, urban street grid, pedestrian orientation, mixed land uses, structured parking and acute attention to the details of dynamic public space. The project called for 475 apartments, a 130-room hotel, 12-screen cinema, 113,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space and parking, plotted on a 9.9-acre residential and commercial development. The project encompasses part or all of 10 parcels on Allstate Road, West Howell and Enterprise streets, and Baker and Field courts ‚Äî formerly largely vacant, commercial/industrial land and parking lots south of South Bay Center. Existing buildings on the site include the closed Kam Man food market, a closed two-story office building, a vacant shipping and loading facility and the Aggregate Concrete plant.idem Collectively, South Bay Center and its surrounding developments encompass the neighborhood of South Bay, within Dorchester, Boston. South Bay, Boston, MA: map of Dorchester neighborhoods Completed in 2020, South Bay's Andi apartment complex is surrounded by luxury condominium complexes on Willow Court, Baker Court, Field Court, and Enterprise Streets. According to Boston Business Journal, Willow Baker LLC is proposing three residential buildings, spanning a combined 208,470 square feet, that would also include neighborhood retail, commercial office space and parking. ‚ÄúThe Proponent envisions revitalizing and converting the combined Project Site into a mixed-use development that enhances its immediate area, with new widened sidewalks, public realm and open space, pedestrian and vehicular access and underground utility upgrades for the immediate area,‚Äù attorney Joseph P. Hanley wrote in a Jan. 22, 2020, letter of intent. Willow Baker LLC has acquired rights to develop on 1.3 acres of property, comprising 13 parcels ‚Äúof underutilized and distressed properties‚Äù along Willow, Baker and Fields Court, near the intersection of Allstate Road and Massachusetts Avenue, within South Bay, Boston. Surrounding area The South Bay, Boston, area surrounding the shopping center has experienced gentrification since development begin in 2015. Large development contributes to a more advanced stage of gentrification. While some sentiment has been positive about this change, high prices for property in the South Bay neighborhood will make it harder for owners of commercial and industrial uses to resist selling out. South Bay continues to be a stop for developers looking to attract downtown workers, according to local real estate specialists. In 2015, Boston had 706 violent crimes per 100,000 people, a rate that is much lower than cities with comparable populations, according to police statistics that had been reported to the FBI. The persistent crime in some of Boston‚Äôs neighborhoods, including Dorchester, appears to correlate with a host of socio-economic factors. In Dorchester, where poverty remains entrenched in some sections, the unemployment rate has historically been higher than in the rest of the city.

Her mediums are representational oils, watercolor and printmaking. One of her most noteworthy bodies of work is a collection based on the writings of African-American novelist and anthropologist Zora Neale Hurston. The Hurston exhibition is a two hundred plus piece collection of monotypes and paintings. It toured the United States on and off from 1991 through 2010.  Life  Ann Graves was born in 1934 and raised in the Homewood community in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She was drawn to art at an early age. She credits the actions of a kindergarten teacher as her introduction to art. In order to relax her separation anxiety from her mother on the first day of school, the teacher gave Tanksley crayons and beads. Tanksley said the items comforted her and launched the beginning of her artistic expression. Tanksley graduated from South Hills High School in 1952 and from Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) in 1956 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.  Career  Following graduation from college she married fellow Homewood native John Tanksley and they moved to Brooklyn, New York. He worked as a photo re- toucher in the advertising industry. Tanksley decided to focus on raising her daughters before pursuing painting full time. In the interim before launching her career as a full-time artist, she worked in arts education. She was an art instructor at Queens Youth Center for the Arts from 1959 ‚Äì 1962, the Arts Center of Northern New Jersey, 1963 and substitute instructor of art at Malvern Public Schools in 1971. She also served as an adjunct art instructor at Suffolk County Community College from 1973-1975. Throughout her early career she continued her education and development as an artist by pursuing studies at several programs, including the Arts League of New York and the New School for Social Research, now known as The New School. She also studied at the Paulette Singer Workshop in Great Neck, New York, and the Robert Blackburn Printmaking Workshop, where she learned the monotype printmaking technique, prominent in the Zora Neale Hurston works. In addition to Blackburn and Singer, Tanksley also studied with several renowned artists throughout her career, including Norman Lewis (artist), Balcomb Greene and Samuel Rosenberg (artist). Tanksley was one of the first members of Where We At: Black Women Artists, Inc., a New York based women‚Äôs art collective. The organization was founded by artists Kay Brown, Dindga McCannon, Faith Ringgold, and others associated with the Black Arts Movement. One of Tanksley‚Äôs early group exhibits was the collectives 1972 show, ‚ÄúCooking and Smokin‚Äù, held at Weusi- Nyumba Ya Sanaa Gallery in Harlem, NY. Where We At: Black Women Artists and other arts groups of the era, like the Ad Hoc Women‚Äôs Art Committee, sponsored exhibits, education and community initiatives to draw attention to the underrepresentation of women of color artists in the Black Arts Movement, in major galleries and museums.Wikipedia, ‚ÄúFaith Ringgold‚Äù, Last modified May 19, 2020, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith_Ringgold; and Wikipedia, ‚ÄúWhere We At,‚Äù Last modified February 29, 2020, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_We_At  Zora Neale Hurston  Tanksley exhibited as early as the late 1960s, but her work began to garner critical acclaim and greater recognition in the 1980s and 1990s. A career turning point was her creation of a large body of work based on the writings of Zora Neale Hurston. The work traveled throughout the United States in the 1990s and the first decade of the 21st Century. She was introduced to Hurston during the 1980s upon discovering amongst her daughter‚Äôs belongings a copy of Hurston‚Äôs book, Their Eyes Were Watching God. She read the book and was so inspired by it that she read many of Hurston‚Äôs other works. Tanksley ‚Äúimmediately fell in love with her writing,‚Äù she said in a 1996 New York Times interview. ‚ÄúHer material is all so visual that I feel we have much in common in interests, as well as in being African-American artists.‚Äù Her interest in Hurston led to a collaboration on Zora: A Psychoanalytic and Artistic Interpretation of the Life and Works of Zora Neale Hurston, by psychoanalyst Dr. Hugh F. Butts. Although the book was never published, Tanksley ultimately created more than 200 paintings and black-and-white monotypes based on Hurston‚Äôs writings. In an interview about her 1993 exhibition, ‚ÄúZora Neale Hurston as Muse: Art of Ann Tanksley‚Äù at the Maitland Art Center in Maitland, Florida, Tanksley suggested Hurston was both a ‚ÄúSpiritual Sister‚Äù and muse. She is quoted saying, ‚ÄúI felt connected to her in so many ways. She came to New York from Florida, I came from Pittsburgh, both of us to make our way as artists.‚Äù  Artistic style and inspiration  In his book, The Art of Black American Women: Works of Twenty-Four Artists of the Century, Robert Henke describes Tanksley‚Äôs work as follows: ‚ÄúHer work reflects the influence of her travels, the residential colors, the simple work habits, the loneliness, and the love and devotion to one‚Äôs spiritual beliefs. There is a oneness of artist and concept. Her love of life despite social barriers and frustrations is promoted in her work for audiences to witness and accept, for there is little to reject in Tanksley‚Äôs world of art. Her paintings evoke a spiritual awakening. One is drawn to the intensity of color that prevails and identifies the moods of feasts and celebrations. Where muted colors appear, there also appears the brightness of the future. Life is full of anticipation and dedication, of acceptance and hope, of faith and survival. These are all present in the works of Ann Tanksley.‚Äù The Educator‚Äôs Guide to the Hewitt Collection of African American describes Tanksley as having \\"a sensitive eye for form and style. She has studied French and Caribbean art as well as the work of other African American artists. She utilizes color, line, and perspective to create a dramatic image that underscores content. Her graphic style incorporates flat areas of intense color that emphasize line and form, prompting comparisons to the work of Paul Gauguin and Henri Matisse. Tanksley's loose brushwork adds vigor and energy to her compositions.\\"  Other work  Tanksley has illustrated several books, including The Six Fools by Zora Neale Hurston and adapted by Joyce Carol Thomas (Harper Collins, 2006), and My Heart Will Not Sit Down by Mara Rockliff (Knopf Books for Young Readers, 2012). Her work is in the permanent collections of the Studio Museum in Harlem in New York, the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C., and Medgar Evers College, in Brooklyn, NY. She is also in prominent private collections, including the John and Vivian Hewitt Collection and Oprah Winfrey's collection.

Story (August 25, 1841 - March 25, 1915) was a career officer in the United States Army who attained the rank of major general. An 1865 graduate of the United States Military Academy, he served from shortly after the end of the American Civil War until retiring in 1905. A specialist in the use of coastal artillery for harbor defense, he was most notable for his service as commandant of the Artillery School (1902-1904) and the Army's Chief of Artillery (1904-1905). Early life John Patten Story was born in Brookfield, Wisconsin on August 25, 1841, the oldest of five children born to John P. Story (1806-1875) and Elizabeth (Quarles) Story (1816-1904). Story's family included several prominent individuals, including Joseph Story, who was his grand-uncle and William A. Barstow, who was an uncle by marriage. His siblings included William Story, who served as a federal judge and as lieutenant governor of Colorado. His brother Francis was a banker and businessman in California who served as president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. His sister Elizabeth was the wife of Brigadier General Henry Albert Reed. His sister Anna was the wife of Judge Albert M. Stephens, who served on the probate court bench of Los Angeles County, California. Story was educated in the schools of Waukesha, Wisconsin and received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Carroll College in 1858. He began to study law in preparation for a career as an attorney, but later decided on a military career and applied for admission to the United States Military Academy. Story was accepted, and began attendance at West Point in 1861. He graduated in 1865, ranked 20th in a class of 68. Start of career Story was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 16th Infantry on June 23, 1865, and was promoted to first lieutenant on the same day. He served with his regiment at Madison Barracks, New York until August 1866, except for three months in Albany, New York as aide-de-camp to John C. Robinson, who commanded one of the districts of the Army's Department of the East. From March to August 1866, Story served on post-war occupation duty in Nashville, Tennessee, first with the 16th Infantry, then with the 34th Infantry. He performed recruiting duty until April 1868, followed by special duty with the Signal Corps until August 1869. He was assigned to the 2nd Artillery Regiment in December 1870 and the 4th Artillery in January 1871. Story served on the West Point faculty from August 1869 to October 1874, first as assistant professor of mathematics, then as assistant professor of geography, history, and ethics, followed by service as principal assistant professor of mathematics. Story joined a battery of the 4th Artillery at the Presidio of San Francisco in October 1874, and remained until December 1875. He served as quartermaster and commissary at San Diego Barracks, California from December 1875 until February 1876, followed by return to his battery in San Francisco. He attended the Artillery School at Fort Monroe, Virginia from May to August 1876, after which he was again assigned to special duty with the Signal Corps. The Signal Corps established the Weather Bureau in 1870, and Story made extensive studies in meteorology as part of his duties. He became adept at predicting the weather, and was recognized as one of the Army's foremost experts on how changes in weather affected military activities, including artillery fire. Continued career In September 1883, Story was promoted to captain and in October he joined a battery of the 4th Artillery at Fort Warren, Massachusetts. While assigned to Fort Warren, Story's commands included Battery H, 4th Artillery and Battery I, 4th Artillery. In addition, he served as acting commander of the Fort Warren post on several occasions. Story remained at Fort Warren until April 1888, when he was assigned as an instructor at the Artillery School. He remained on the faculty at Fort Monroe until May 1898, and he was promoted to major in March 1898. During the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Story commanded the Harbor Defenses of Portland, Maine. From May 1898 to March 1902, Story was Inspector of Artillery for the Department of the East, and he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in May 1901. In March 1902, he was appointed commandant of the Artillery School, where he served until January 1904. He was promoted to colonel in October 1902. In January 1904, Story was assigned as the Army's Chief of Artillery. He was promoted to major general on June 17, 1905, and he retired on June 19, 1905. As a specialist in the use of coastal artillery to defend harbors, Story was a member of the Army's Board of Ordnance and Fortifications from 1901 to 1902 and 1904 to 1905. He was a member of the Joint Army Navy Board from 1904 to 1905 and the National Coast Defense Board from 1905 to 1907. After retiring, Story remained on duty to inspect coast artillery fortifications in California, which included San Francisco, San Pedro, and Fort Rosecrans. In 1906 he undertook a similar inspection tour in Hawaii, Guam, and the Philippines. In 1907 he served on a panel that observed the testing of new artillery at Sandy Hook Proving Ground and he later served on an Army board that considered the use of the Crozier and Brown wire-wound gun. Retirement and death Deciding that the climate of southern California had a positive effect on his health, Story retired to Pasadena, California. He died at his home in Pasadena on March 25, 1915. Story was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Family In 1868, Story married Caroline Sherman (1848-1923) of Trenton, New Jersey. They were the parents of two children, John P. Story Jr. and Caroline Sherman Story. John P. Story Jr. (1872-1966) was involved in the real estate and insurance businesses. He worked and lived primarily in Washington, D.C. Caroline Story (1870-1914) was the wife of Belgian diplomat Count Conrad De Buisseret. When she died in December 1914 as the result of diphtheria contracted while working as a nurse near the front lines of World War I, her husband was serving as Minister to Russia in Petrograd. According to contemporary newspaper accounts, General Story's health declined rapidly after learning of his daughter's death in Belgium, and he died soon afterwards. Legacy Story was the author of 1894's Elements of Elastic Strength of Guns. This technical work was used for several years as a textbook at the Artillery School. The Army's Fort Story, now Joint Expeditionary Base Fort Story, was named for Story. A U.S. Army mine planting ship, USAMP General John P. Story, was launched in 1919 and was named in Story's honor. The ship was later rechristened USCGC Acacia, and was used by the United States Lighthouse Service and United States Coast Guard until it was sunk during World War II.

Mallinen studied literature at the Moscow State University during 1972‚Äì78. He wrote his master's thesis on Mikhail Bulgakov‚Äôs work The Master and Margarita. During 1979‚Äì89 he worked for Finnish businesses involved in trade with the Soviet Union, e.g. for Kone. During 1993‚Äì95 he was the head of The Finnish Institute in St. Petersburg. Since 1998 he has worked as an independent translator, translating Russian literature, both prose and poetry. During 2006‚Äì09 he acted as the president of the Finnish branch of PEN International. Mallinen on Russia Mallinen studied in the Philological Faculty of Moscow State University during 1972‚Äì78. He says that during that time his eyes were opened, when he made acquaintances with the literary underworld. He went to Moscow as a communist, but he returned to Finland as an anticommunist. Even in those years, \\"the Philological Faculty was full of dissidents, and people there read widely forbidden literature. A sturdy East German Erika typewriter could handle four sheets of paper, with carbon paper between the sheets: One could borrow a popular work for a night, if one delivered four copies of it to the lender. One could keep one copy,‚Äù Mallinen says. Even during his student days, Mallinen smuggled forbidden literature from the Soviet Union to Finland. Later, when he worked for Finnish businesses, he translated e. g. the poems of Eduard Limonov. He was somewhat scared at the time, since if he had been found out, he could have lost his visa, and then he would have had to look for other employment. Mallinen has written on his views on Russia in his first book entitled Varastettua ilmaa (‚Äòstolen air‚Äô, 2008). He is worried about the current state of affairs in Russia. He compares Vladimir Putin to Ivan the Terrible, and he sees parallels between Russia and Nazi Germany. The Russian regime wants to squash the civil rights. The regime represents \\"neo-barbarism\\", with a cult of power, hierarchical organization and the lack of rule of law. The nationalism promoted by the dominant culture wants to stifle multiculturalism, and it leads to stagnation and fossilization of culture. The Orthodox Church has allied itself with militarism and the current regime, and the nationalism is mixed with patriotism, racism and xenophobia. According to Mallinen, racist views are the mainstream in Russia. He says that the Russian mainstream represents Huntingtonian cultural racism, which does not classify people according to their colour of skin, but according to their values. The Finnish critics of Islam, such as represented by Timo Vihavainen and Jussi Halla-aho, have imported their ideas from Russia. According to Mallinen, in Russian history, Finno-Ugric peoples have been silenced. Mallinen has quite a bleak view on Putin's Russia: the regime wants to recreate the Soviet regime: Mallinen considers the Finland-Russia Society a stooge of the Kremlin, transformed as such by Heikki Talvitie and Paula Lehtom√§ki. In the magazine of the society, Ven√§j√§n Aika, Mallinen has been likened to Johan B√§ckman, and the dialogue between the two has been labeled \\"quarrels of village idiots\\". Mallinen as the head of Finnish PEN During 2006‚Äì09 Mallinen served as the president of the Finnish PEN. He raised the profile of PEN by his active engagement in cultural discussion, and he commented e. g. on Russian affairs and on the Commonwealth of Independent States. For example, PEN was among the organizers of the candle protests outside the Russian Embassy in Finland in 2006, after the murder of Anna Politkovskaya. During Mallinen's presidency, there were some controversies concerning Russia within the Finnish PEN. He was criticized by vice president Rita Dahl, and also the board of trustees were divided. Dahl said Mallinen was a publicity seeker, and she accused him of curbing free speech and of \\"neo-Finlandization. Mallinen said he was being persecuted by the newspaper Tiedonantaja, that he was the spitting bowl of Putinists and that authoritarian and dictatorial elements were trying to infiltrate the Finnish PEN.

The structure is so named because the Prince and Princess of Naples Joseph Bonapartes grandson Louis Joseph and his wife Laura, attended a ceremonial excavation of selected rooms there on March 22, 1898. The house is painted throughout in the Pompeian Fourth Style and is valued by scholars because its decoration is all of a single style and single period, unlike many surviving Roman structures that are found to be a hodgepodge of styles from different periods.  Initial excavation  House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii floor plan The initial excavation began in October 1896 after the structure's entrances were discovered following the excavation of the expansive House of the Vettii. The excavation team entered through the fauces into the atrium and surrounding rooms and finds were reported in rooms (c), (d), and (n). The work continued until the end of December, 1896, with further finds discovered in (d), (n), (e), (g), and (l). Excavations did not resume until February, 1897, when the kitchen and two cubiculums were finally cleared. Then the garden was cleared on May 21. Excavations where artifacts were expected were reserved for a formal royal visit in the spring of 1898. At the official naming ceremonial excavation on March 22, 1898 rich finds were made in two cubiculums, the tablinum, the triclinium and the exedra. Another ceremonial excavation in front of the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar on March 29, 1898, resulted in finds in the pantry and the room accessed through entrance 7 that housed a staircase to the upper floor, at which point the excavation was officially ended. Protective roofs were erected, then in 1972, the ground floor was completely covered after razing much of the ancient walls of the upper story so flat concrete ceilings could be installed and tiled roofs constructed over the atrium and Porticus.Strocka 1984, p. 17.  Construction chronology  The house was determined by German archaeologists to have been originally constructed during the Limestone Age (3rd century BCE) due to the entrance consisting entirely of opus incertum with cruma and lava, rather than the late 2nd century BCE originally proposed by Italian excavators. German researchers also point to the limestone framework of the southern wall of the garden which also demonstrates the construction belonged to this earlier period. The absence of limestone posts in the dividing wall between the atrium and the portico indicates that partition was a subsequent modification. The dwelling(s) fronted the Viccola dei Vetti and the spaces on either sides of their main entrances appear to have been initially involved in commercial activities. German archaeologists noted the presence of holes indicating the suspension of a canopy on the north section of the external facade.  Late 2nd century BCE  During the late 2nd century BCE, Pompeii experienced a major population expansion and the insulae of Region VI became dotted with establishments engaged in urban commerce. Furthermore, the upper floor of this structure, demolished in the 1970s, above (a), (b), (c) (e), (f), (i),(k) and (l) is thought to have contained rooms that were possibly rented out as apartments.Strocka 1984, p.18 Atrium of the House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii watercolor, 1898, by Luigi Bazzani German archaeologists date the construction of the impluvium to the early 1st century BCE in part because of the surrounding floor pavement of punteggiato regolare, a signinum featuring spaced travertine tesserae used widely in Pompeii beginning about 100 BCE. This improvement is thought to have been part of an overall renovation of the northern portion of the structure at that time.Strocka 1984, p.19. This activity may have been initiated to repair widespread damage and reflect a possible change of ownership that coincided with the aftermath of the Social War. Pompeii was one of the Campanian cities that rebelled against Rome in this conflict. In 89, BCE, the general, and later dictator, Lucius Cornelius Sulla, laid siege to Pompeii, bombarding Region VI's Porta Ercolano with his artillery, as evidenced by impact craters from thousands of sling bullets and ballistae bolts still visible on the ancient city wall. The nearly 4 foot- square impluvium is slightly south of the entrance axis to make it parallel to the room's south wall. A large marble table (cartibulum) supported by winged griffins found at the site has been placed at the impluvium's west edge since 1977.Strocka 1984, p. 19. The off-centered axis of the impluvium served to focus the attention of visitors to the left side of the atrium where doorways to public reception rooms were located. This differentiation of space also guided attention away from the dimly illuminated utility areas of the house positioned in the right half of the atrium, the undecorated cubiculum of the ostiarius (a), with narrow stairs possibly leading to slave quarters on the upper floor, and the undecorated kitchen, latrine, and pantry (g) and (h). The pantry or storage room could have also been used as an eating area for the household slaves as well. This off-centered arrangement reflects the influence of Greek architectural designs of Hellenistic houses and palaces where visiting males were purposefully directed away from female-inhabited interior spaces. But, where the Greeks used the arrangement to create privacy, the Romans used it to contrast space for invited as opposed to uninvited visitors.  1st century CE  The next major renovation took place In the 1st half of the 1st century CE, when the passageway between the atrium accessed through entrance 8 and the space that would become the porticus in the structure accessed through entrance 7 was cut. A new partition with windows was constructed to separate the space southwest of the atrium, that would become the barrel-vaulted tablinium with adjoining barrel-vaulted cubiculum and provide views of the garden.Strocka 1984, pp. 19-24. The barrel-vaulted tablinum decorated in the Fourth Style, House of the Prince of Naples, Pompeii This essentially created a \\"master suite\\" with views of the garden from both rooms and the provision of extra light augmented by the oculus in cubiculum (f). Scholars point to a persistent pattern in Roman architecture like this whereby a larger reception room, the tablinum in this case, is juxtaposed to a smaller room of suitable proportions for a bedroom, confirmed by the presence of a bed, denoting a hierarchy of intimacy where a guest could progress from the tablinum to the bedroom and, perhaps, to the bed recess itself. The windows also provided a framed view into the garden for visitors in the left half of the atrium and provided supplemental lighting. Both Cicero and Pliny the Elder, familiar with the precepts of famed Roman architect Vetruvius, discuss the importance of a framed view in Roman architecture not only for aesthetic purposes, but to demonstrate control over raw nature, and even modest homeowners would have been aware of these architectural strategies. The new passageway also provided more efficient access from the kitchen to the repurposed large triclinium and, subsequently, the new exedra as well. The space that would become the triclinium was enclosed and an east‚Äìwest barrel vault was suspended from the ceiling. The east wall was constructed with diamond-shaped limestone opus reticulatum, which in Pompeii is mostly post- Augustan.Strocka 1984, p.26. For the owners of the House of the Prince of Naples to repurpose what would have been prime commercial space along the Viccolo dei Vetti to domestic use would indicate a wealthier individual than previous occupants now owned the property. The new owner was putting aside economic space in order to generate social capital. If the new owner was, in fact, a physician, as indicated by finds of surgical instruments, his economic interests would have probably been better served by gaining patients with elevated social status. The summer triclinium added about 55 BCE and decorated in the Fourth Style, House of the Prince of Naples A new partition forming the triclinium's north wall enclosed an adjoining room accessed through entrance 7 that contained a stairway to the upper floor. Columns were added between the garden and the rest of the space previously accessed through entrance 7.Strocka 1984, pp. 24 ‚Äì 29. An east-west barrel vault was also added to cubiculum (c) and tablinum (e) and a north‚Äìsouth barrel vault was added to cubiculum (f) as well. The oculus in cubiculum (f), providing additional lighting to that space, may have been installed at this time, too.Strocka 1984, p. 50.  About 55 CE  In about 55 CE, based on painting style and the slight relocation of one of the portico's columns, the exedra with north‚Äìsouth barrel vault was constructed against the south wall of the porticus. Its east wall enclosed a small apotheca (space for a cabinet) between the exedra and the triclinium.Strocka 1984, p.29. After the major quake in 62 CE, new plastering is in evidence on the south wall of the triclinium, the west wall of the porticus, the north and south walls of cubiculum (c), the end walls of the fauces, and around the lararium in the garden. Also, at some point after the quake, the large door opening to the street on the east wall of room (i) was closed off as well with incertum composed of various materials, probably earthquake debris. Decoration and finds= Fauces (b)  The Fauces is paved with gray signinum with a net of rectangularly laid rows of white tesserae. There are two dark ocher-colored pilasters that were repaired, possibly due to the quake of 62 CE. The space includes the remains of a figurative picture thought by some scholars to have been Priapus or some similar guardian figure. The socle, painted black, is divided by yellow lines with yellow candelabra, with a red main zone and white upper zone. Cubes outlined with gray and red are painted in the white upper zone to imitate masonry, a decorative motif carried over from the First Style.Strocka 1984, p. 18.  Atrium (d)  Bronze bucket with handles terminating in upturned goose heads from a Pompeii thermopolium similar to the one found in the atrium The atrium, like the fauces has a black socle topped with a red main zone and white upper zone painted with three rows of rectangles outlined in gray and red. The red main zone is defined by narrow green bands with light green border lines and a filigree border with a simple bud pattern applied in ocher. Floating emblems include dancing swans and other birds thought to be peacocks. In the atrium, excavators found a bronze basin with two handles terminating in the form of the heads of geese, another wide- mouthed bronze basin with two movable handles, a bronze bucket with a movable handle, a circular box with a hinged lid, a bronze fibula, a saucepan with protruding lip and circular handle, another large bucket with movable handle terminating in upturned goose heads with a fixed ring for hanging in the center, and two inscribed terracotta amphora. A large bronze bucket of this type was most often used to mix wine with water in the kitchen area before serving. It was then transferred to a pitcher for pouring the watered wine into a cup or glass.  Cubiculum (c)  Cubiculum C Emblem of dancing swan on North Wall The black socle in this room is speckled with red and ochre to simulate marbling and is separated from the white main zone by an ochre stripe. The red-framed white main zone is divided by black vertical lines with red inner frames into panels with floating emblems of dancing swans and jumping goats. There is a window on the east wall that extends into the upper zone to provide supplemental lighting. There is a recently installed bed niche in the north wall where the gray signinum floor pavement had not yet been repaired. Three holes, two in the north wall and one in the western half of the side wall are suspected \\"robber\\" holes that were filled in by conservators to prevent further access. A human skull and partial skeleton was found in the room along with a bronze surgical instrument, a herm with a feminine head and phallus in relief (Aphroditus), a small bell, a piece of bone worked on a lathe with a movable hook at the top, a spindle mold, and two pyramid-shaped weights. A fragmented tile with Oscan brand was also recovered.Strocka 1984, p. 20. Late 20th century German scholars speculated the skeleton is probably the remains of a looter killed by falling debris. However, the presence of a surgical instrument, the apotropaic Aphroditus herm, and the bell coupled with the discovery of other surgical instruments at the site point to the possibility that the individual may have been a patient being treated by a resident physician.  Cubiculum (a)  All walls were plastered with rough black sand. The north wall above the west to east facing steps leading to the upper floor was plastered in a fine pale pink mixture. This room is thought to have been the bedroom of the ostiarius (doorman) and, perhaps, his family. The room contained a bronze candelabrum in the shape of a three-footed tree supported by three twigs. Excavators also found an as (coin) minted by Tiberius, three asses minted by Nero, and a dupondius minted by Vespasian. Additional finds included a bronze perforated cylinder, a lead pyramidal weight, a terracotta urceo (a jug often used for garum) a jar without handles, a lamp with a fragmented handle, a saucer, and a glass bottle with a large neck.Strocka 1984, p. 21.  Kitchen with latrine (g)  The remains of a stove were found in the northwest corner of this space with a large round- arched storage niche above it and a latrine was identified in the northeast corner. Originally, there was a doorway to the space that would become the tablinum, but at some point it was bricked up. There was also the remains of a wooden staircase to the upper floor along the south wall. The only wall finish remaining is unpainted reddish plaster. Finds reported in this space include two unguentaria, a small conical-shaped bottle, a bottle with a spherical belly, and a small glass cup. Bronze items included a two-clasp padlock, a twisted physician's scalpel with iron blade and olive leaf-shaped handle, a boss supported by a moving ring, and a rectangular lock shield. Excavators also found a terracotta vessel with handle and bulging belly, a cup-shaped vase with two handles and an amphora.  Pantry (h)  This storage area had only the remains of coarse plaster on the walls. Finds included an elliptical bronze figure-shaped basin, two bronze casseroles with perforated handles, a bronze base with a handle terminating in swan heads and a mask in the fragmented bottom, another bronze basin without handles, a bronze clasp, a bronze hook, and a corroded as minted by Tiberius. Other finds included two terracotta procoes, a lagena with two handles, an amphora with two handles, a pignattino with a cover without handles, a fragmented saucepan, an imitation Arezzo pot (Arrentine ware), a saucer, a lamp with one luminello decorated with two dolphins and a rudder, a glass odorino, a crustacean shell, a fragmented iron ax and the bones of chickens and sheep.Strocka 1984, page 22.  Tablinum (e)  Pinax on West Wall of the Tablinum in the House of the Prince of Naples Supports for stucco or wooden door panels were found on the south wall. The floor is paved with cocciopesto with travertine and lava skirts. The black socle and white main zone is divided into panels. Socle emblems include dancing swans, fluttering birds, and light and dark green leafy perennials and simply drawn lotus blossoms. The main fields include green leaf groups with red stems. Pinakes of a dog chasing a deer and a dog barking at a deer jumping to the right are painted on the north wall on either side of an ocher-colored architectural framework. In the white lunette of the west wall, a hippocamp and three dolphins are painted. In the center of the west wall, an architectural framework is painted with a left-facing griffin perched on the corner of its molding. A pinax of two fish surrounded by other marine animals is painted in the right panel and a gold bucket or vessel with ladle is painted in the upper left panel above the doorway to cubiculum (f). Finds include one cylindrical boiler without handles, another boiler with a base attached by two brackets in the form of unrecognizable animals turned upwards, a ring attached to a handle and corresponding lid suspended by a chain, another small ring attached to a key chain, a branded terracotta tile, a large, circular iron brazier, a bronze oleare with a detached handle, another oleare similar in size, and two door hinges.Strocka 1984, p. 22.  Cubiculum (f)  German archaeologists detected plaster edges of lost wooden door panels that could close the doorway between the tablinum and this cubiculum. Similar to the tablinum, this space has a black socle divided into panels with broadleafed green plants accented by yellow flower ornaments under the pilaster strips. The main zone is white divided into panels by dark red stripes. Panels are further detailed with filigree borders and floating emblems of opposing griffins, flying swans with heads turned back, dolphins, and jumping bucks. In the lunette of the alcove there is an outline of a peacock facing to the right and two round fruits.Strocka 1984, p. 23.  Porticus (l)  Porticus looking into the Exedra at The House of the Prince of Naples, Pompeii, Italy 2nd century BCE - 1st century CE Pinax of Birds and Fruit The floor pavement is coarse cocciopesto. The black socle, divided by white lines, is accented by simple diamonds enclosing four-petaled flowers. The main and upper zones are white framed by red stripes and separated from the socle with an ochre stripe. In the center of the north wall is a pilaster strip enclosing an ocher-shaded candelabra crowned by a frontal sphinx in dark red and blue-green. To the right of the pilaster strip is a red-framed pinax of two birds with cherries and mirabelles. The upper zone is divided by ornamental borders into symmetrical panels accented with floral tendrils. Border designs on what remains of the painting on the remaining walls have a different pattern from the north wall. A small preserved panel to the right of the doorway on the east wall contains a yellow dolphin. Finds include a bronze bucket with movable handle, an oval frying pan with long ring-shaped handle, two fine handles with masks belonging to a boiler, a small pelvis (mortar and pestle) with the pestle in the form of a human finger, and a terracotta amphora. On the south side of the peristyle, excavators found a bronze circular frying pan, and an oval lid with movable handle.Strocka 1984, p. 24.  Secondary Room (i) with stairs (p) to upper floor  In the (p) portion of the space containing the stairs to the upper floor there is coarse plaster composed of black sand with little brick chippings. On the tongue wall and below the former flight of stairs. The same plaster is used on the remaining walls of (i) except on the south and east walls where a socle of fine reddish plaster was applied up to 1 3/4 m. high. On the east wall a pilaster next to entrance 7 is red and the inside of the adjoining partition wall is painted ocher. Excavators found 54 rectangular counterweights in pyramidal form with holes to suspend them in the space under the staircase.Strocka 1984, p. 25.  Triclinium (k)  Triclinium East Wall North wall of the oecus richly decorated in the Fourth Style he floor pavement in this space is fine red- colored cocciopesto and in the center of the room is an opus sectile geometric mosaic composed of squares and triangles in different colored marbles. A stucco cornice has survived completely on the east wall but only in remnants on the north wall and is fragmented in the lunette of the barrel vault. A variety of filigree borders are used to define the three panels of the Fourth Style main zone wall paintings above a red-violet socle embellished with plants, birds and dolphins. Faux architectural structures draped in leaf garlands and animated with goats, birds and griffins, twisted candelabras, and small shrines enclosing plinths supporting Medusa heads, frontal sphinxes or Dionysian panthers with kantharos populate the upper zone. On the east wall in the main zone, two aedicula containing a twisted candelabra capped with an ornate entablature topped with tragic masks flank a framed panel painting of either Paris and Helen or Adonis and Aphrodite with erotes standing between them.Strocka 1984, p. 26. The original Italian excavators, August Mau and Antonio Sogliano, identified the couple as Paris and Helen. German archaeologist Volker Michael Strocka, analyzing the painting in his 1984 survey of the structure disagreed, pointing out that Paris was not wearing an oriental costume or is accompanied by any other attributes associated with Paris and there is no depiction in which Paris and Helen face each other in spite of numerous other examples of the couple elsewhere in Pompeii. Instead, Strocka said the young man's chlamys represents a hero's attire and points to the remnants of a spear shaft in the painting. He also points out that the woman as described by Sogliano as wearing a gold diadem, earrings, necklace, armillae and the usual golden cord that crosses her chest as in figures of Venus, closely resembles numerous descriptions of Aphrodite-Venus. He then concludes that since the young man lacks the usual weapons that normally accompany a depiction of Ares, the figure must be Adonis if the woman is Aphrodite. Strocka also mentions two post-Pompeian representations which, like this painting, depict Adonis on the left wearing a cloak and equipped with only a spear and Aphrodite on the right.Strocka 1984, p.43 In the upper zone of the east wall were three rectangular pinakes that have been completely destroyed although the original excavator Mau described the center one that was still intact at that time. He describes a night landscape with a partially covered bridge over a river with two barks with oarsmen. Two other men on the bridge appear to be helping the barks to land. On the north wall of the triclinium, two fanciful aedicula with peacocks flank a framed panel painting of Perseus and Andromeda. Perseus, on the left, is heroically nude and grips the head of Medusa above the couple's heads so it reflects in a pool of water so Andromeda can look upon it safely. image:The House of the Prince of Naples Plate 140 Triclinium North Wall Perseus and Andromeda MH.jpgHellenistic Perseus and Andromeda in Triclinium of Casa del Principe di Napoli Region VI image:Perseus and Andromeda MAN Napoli Inv8995.jpgRoman-style Perseus and Andromeda panel painting from the Casa della Saffo in Pompeii Region VI image:Perseo e andromeda con testa della gorgone medusa, da casa dei capitelli colorati a pompei, 8996.jpgRoman-style Perseus and Andromeda panel painting from the Casa dei Capitelli Colorati in Pompeii Region VII Friedrich Matz traces this depiction back to a Hellenistic painting from around the middle of the 2nd century BCE although in this painting he points out that Andromeda is turned outwards as an expressionless mantle figure thereby imitating a pyramid group of 4th century BCE Classicism. Paintings of the couple found elsewhere in Pompeii, including in the oecus of Casa dei Capitelli Colorati (VII, 4, 51-31) and the Casa della Saffo, (Pompeii VI) reflect a Roman version wth Perseus looking at Andromeda, not at the mirror image of Medusa.Strocka 1984, p. 44. The south and west walls were originally similarly decorated like the east wall. A third panel painting on the south wall was totally destroyed, probably by earthquake activity as early as 62 CE. Strocka concludes it was probably another heroic pair of lovers representing opposite or complementary aspects of love. image:Triclinium Opus Sectile in the House of the Prince of Naples, Pompeii Region VI 1st century CE.jpgTriclinium Opus Sectile Mosaic image:House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii Plate 147 Triclinium Emblem on North Wall MH.jpgErote Emblem on North Wall of triclinium image:House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii Plate 141 Triclinium East Wall Adonis and Aphrodite MH.jpgAdonis and Aphrodite on Triclinium East Wall image:House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii Plate 144 Triclinium South Wall MH.jpgTriclinium South Wall detail image:House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii Plate 146 Triclinium East Wall Main Zone MH.jpgTriclinium East Wall Main Zone image:House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii Plate 148 Triclinium South Wall Main Zone MH.jpgTriclinium South Wall Main Zone image:House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii Plate 149 Triclinium South Wall Upper Zone MH.jpgTriclinium South Wall Upper Zone image:House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii Plate 150 Triclinium North Wall Upper Zone MH.jpgTriclinium North Wall Upper Zone image:House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii Plate 151 Triclinium East Wall Upper Zone MH.jpgTriclinium East Wall Upper Zone image:House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii Plate 152 Triclinium East Wall Upper Zone MH.jpgTriclinium East Wall Upper Zone image:House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii Plate 153 Triclinium East Wall Upper Zone MH.jpgTriclinium East Wall Upper Zone image:House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii Plate 154 Triclinium East Wall Upper Zone MH.jpgTriclinium East Wall Upper Zone Finds in this largest of the reception rooms included a bronze basin with two handles depicting twisted dolphins with silver ornaments, a bronze basket with two movable handles terminated in swan heads, a bronze vase with a palmette- shaped handle, a large-bellied bronze vase with a swan head and human thumb on the upper handle and vine leaves on the lower end, a bronze vase with two handles of simple work, a bronze lamp with one luminello and double volute handle, four rings containing chains, another ring containing four chains, two bronze studs with rings, four large bronze studs without rings, a long spindle and a circular lead weight with bronze handle.  Apotheca (o)  This corridor-like room, only 34 inches wide by about 6 1/2 feet deep, is thought to have contained a cabinet for herbs or medicinal compounds. It has the same floor pavement as the porticus and appears to have been intentionally created when the exedra (summer triclinium) was constructed within the south side of the porticus. Its walls were painted white with dividing stripes in red and ocher above a black socle. On the east wall is a twisted candelabra overlapped by a red filigree border and fragments of a red ornamental ribbon, green leaf garland with red fruits and a green lion-griffin springing to the left. There is a small window placed in line of sight of the lararium in the garden.Strocka 1984, p. 29.  Exedra (summer triclinium) (m)  House of the Prince of Naples Pompeii Plate 159 Exedra Bacchus MH House of the Prince of Naples Pompeii Plate 160 Exedra Venus MH White main and upper zones are painted above a red-violet socle punctuated with floral motifs, dolphins, and, on the south wall a Bucranium, and accented with filigree borders. The south wall main zone features ornate aediculae flanking a framed mural of the god Bacchus clutching his iconic thyrsus staff and pouring wine from a kantharos. His often present panther licks at the wine as it flows down. Bacchus is nude except for a gray cloak draped over his left shoulder. Other scattered animals depicted include swans, goats or antelopes, and griffins with trees and leaf garlands. Three small pinakes are completely faded. A pinax above the framed Bacchus depicts a frontal mask on a green background. Two pinakes to the left and right of Bacchus are citiscapes with human figures and architectural elements. The west wall has similar depictions of fantastical architecture and animals with a framed mural of the goddess Venus. She is shown wringing the sea water from her hair, a typical pose in Pompeian art. She is completely nude except for gold hoops on her wrists and ankles, two gold necklaces, and two crossed strings held together by a brooch. She also wears a tiara. Above her frame is a pinax but the subject is no longer recognizable. On the east wall directly across from Venus is a pinax depicting two erotes who have opened a jewelry box. The left erote reaches for a gold hoop in the box while the right erote looks at himself in a hand mirror. A pinax above the central frame is also no longer recognizable. image:House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii Plate 171 (2020) House of the Prince of Naples Exedra erotes Raddato.jpgExedra erotes exploring Venus' jewelry box image:House of the Prince of Naples Pompeii Plate 165 Exedra Bacchus closeup MH.jpgBacchus closeup image:House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii Plate 164 Exedra South Wall Detail MH.jpgExedra South Wall with Pinax Detail image:House of the Prince of Naples Pompeii Plate 168 Exedra South Wall Closeup MH.jpgExedra South Wall Detail image:House of the Prince of Naples Pompeii Plate 166 Exedra East Wall Closeup MH.jpgExedra East Wall Detail image:House of the Prince of Naples Pompeii Plate 167 Exedra East Wall Closeup MH.jpgExedra East Wall Detail image:House of the Prince of Naples in Pompeii Plate 161-162 Exedra South Wall Pinax MH.jpgExedra South Wall Pinakes Finds in the exedra include a bronze balsamarium with two handles, a pastry-shaped bronze vessel, a glass lagena with two handles, two bone mirror cases, a spindle and spindle rod, a terracotta grooved pignattino with one handle, another simple terracotta vessel, and a jar in the shape of a drinking glass. As there is thought to have been a three-room apartment above this space, some of the finds could have fallen from the upper floor.Strocka 1984, p. 33.  Garden (n)  A temple style lararium in the garden On the west wall of the garden is a temple-shaped lararium with four stuccoed columns. the capitals are embellished with dark red calathos (flared fruit baskets) with blue acanthus leaves. In the northeast corner of the garden there is still the barrel-shaped clay wellhead of the cistern opening.Strocka 1984, p. 32. Strocka observed that the owners of the house appeared to consciously place the lararium so the lares could \\"see\\" into each main room of the house as an apotropaic measure.Strocka 1984, p. 49. During this period, Roman philosophers, including Cicero and Pliny the Elder, were promoting the architectural memory system in which the decoration of the home could serve as a mnemonic trigger. So a view of the lararium may have served to remind the occupants of the home of the importance of pietas and visiting guests of the residents' virtue.Bergmann, B. (1994). The Roman House as Memory Theater: The House of the Tragic Poet in Pompeii. The Art Bulletin, 76(2), 225-256. doi:10.2307/3046021 Besides the lararium, finds include a fragmented trapezoid marble table formed by a lion's foot that widens toward the top to support a sculpture of Silenus emerging from acanthus leaves and holding baby Bacchus in his left arm. Excavators also recovered a bronze patera with a fine dog's head handle, a vase with three spouts and a handle supporting a rabbit head, a terracotta amphora, and a bronze handle for a mirror.  Upper floor  None of the upper floor remains after site conservators demolished what was left of it in the early 1970s to facilitate the installation of new ceilings in the ground floor structure to protect visitors. But there were at least two rooms above rooms (a) ‚Äì (c) which were accessed by a wooden staircase in the northeast corner of the atrium. While the original archaeologist Mau assumed there was a single room above (a) and (b) with a second room above (c), German archaeologists proposed a large room above (b) and (c) with an anteroom above (a). In 1896, before demolition, Mau had observed parts of a south wall and partition wall with connecting door for two further rooms over (e) and (f) accessed via a staircase in the kitchen (g). The staircase in (i) led to a separate private apartment above (i), (k) and (l) and not a terrace. Mau reached this conclusion based on remains of eave gutters. Finds made north of House VI 15, 6 were assumed to be from the upper rooms of the House of the Prince of Naples, most likely from this private apartment. Finds included two glass jugs, two unguentaria, a bronze hinge, a very small bronze figure of Fortuna with a ring in the back to hang as an amulet, a small bronze surgical instrument with an eye in one end and a ball on the other, two paterae with fine ram's head handles, a horse blinker, a bronze circular mirror, the bottom of a terracotta Arezzo cup with trademark foot, a black varnished luminello with ring handle with depictions of three divinities seated at a table, and a bronze cylindrical inkwell.  Decoration chronology  Although no graffito survives to aid in the dating of the last decoration of the House of the Prince of Naples, German archaeologists point to significant similarities in recurring motifs and compositional elements to the House of the Silver Wedding where graffito in the northern peristyle is dated 6 February 60 CE. This would indicate that structure and probably the House of the Prince of Naples were last redecorated in the second half of the 50s CE. German archaeologists deemed the decoration modest by the standards of the time and suggest it was owned by representatives of the lower middle class. Strocka points out that the marble tables in the atrium and garden provided a little added prestige as needed for guests or family gatherings. He also observed that the sparse repertoire of emblems and simplest form of motifs as well as the conventional, not very refined nature of the paintings in the triclinium and exedra reflect only a simple theme of lovers of life and the epitome of happiness without any intellectual or even philosophical exaggeration.Strocka 1984, p. 35.  The inhabitants  With a total floor area of only 260 m2, Strocka estimated the number of the inhabitants at six to ten family members, two to five slaves and journeymen, and an additional family of at least four individuals in the upstairs apartment, for a minimum of 12 to a maximum of about 20 inhabitants. This was based on number of bed niches and their capacity and an estimate based on the size of the upstairs apartment, allotting 14 m2 of living space per head. Based on its modest size, at less than 1/10 of the size of the sprawling House of the Faun, Pompeii's largest at 2940 m2, Strocka theorized these people must belong to the lower middle class. He also points to the fact that when the house was extended (or rebuilt) during the Augustan-Tiberian period, the goal was not so much to gain more living space but to add a garden, portico and decorative triclinium to provide more air and light in a lower class imitation of the elite's suburban villas. Since the number of bedrooms did not change, he inferred the family had not increased in size. Strocka concludes the probable presence of a workshop or merchant shop in (i) points to the homeowner being a craftsman or small merchant. He observes that a uniquely apotropaic arrangement of window openings to facilitate lines of sight from the garden lararium to each major room, supplemented with a secondary lararium niche in the kitchen to extend supervision of the household gods to cubiciulum (c), the kitchen (g) and the pantry (h), point to a simple- minded, superstitious people. He also concluded their diminished financial status was indicated by roughly repaired earthquake damage, even after 17 years since the major quake of 62 CE.  Other archaeologists' viewpoints  Other archaeologists disagree. Penelope M. Allison, academic archaeologist specializing in the Roman Empire and professor of archaeology at the University of Leicester observes commonly accepted ideas of spatial organization and function in the houses of Pompeii are fraught with unsubstantiated analogical inference as well as cultural and social prejudices derived from nineteen- and early twentieth-century scholarship She emphasizes that particularly the period between 62 and 79 CE cannot be viewed as a static interim phase between two major seismic events with all pre-eruption damage ascribed to the 62 CE earthquake and subsequent repairs made as a result of it.Allison 2004, p. 8. Her study of 30 atrium-style Pompeian houses, including the House of the Prince of Naples, revealed widespread variations in both structural states of repair and distribution of find assemblages across room types. She observed that ordinary domestic change and ongoing disturbance of some kind (possibly low-level seismic activity) leading up to the final eruption have produced varying patterns of damage, repair, changing room use, and deterioration in Pompeian houses. She said there was a high likelihood the processes of disruption, repair, and abandonment were much less uniform and spread over the final decades in a complex mosaic of disturbance, alteration, and deterioration. Furthermore, processes of post-abandonment intrusion extended for centuries. She observes not only was an earthquake felt in Naples during Nero's reign, in the consulate of Gaius Laecanius and Marcus Licinus (Tacitus Ann. 15, 34) and dated to CE 64,5 but textual evidence also indicates that seismic activity was not unusual in the Campanian region (Seneca Natur. Quaest. 6, 1, 2; Pliny Ep. 6, 20, 3). Pliny the Younger, in his detailed description of the CE 79 eruption, indicated that there had been earthquakes for several days prior to this eruption but that people were not particularly alarmed because such tremors were frequent in the area. Pliny the Elder's belief (Nat. Hist. 2, 198) that earthquakes could continue for up to two years may well have been founded on phenomena observed from his base at Misenum near Naples. Thus, assumptions that a final phase of Pompeii can be identified through damage and repair to its buildings and can be dated from CE 62 represent a misreading of the written documentation.Allison 2004 pp. 15-18. In her analysis of amphorae finds, she comments on amphorae containing building repair material discovered in the Casa del Menandro, the Casa di Julius Polybius, the Casa dei Quadretti Teatrali and the Casa dell'Efebo. This indicates repairs were in progress in houses much larger and probably wealthier than the Casa del Principe di Napoli at the time of eruption.Allison 2004, pp. 150-152. Strocka points to the arrangement of the lararium in the garden and its line of sight through various strategically placed apertures as an indication the inhabitants were more religiously observant than average households or those of the educated elite. But Allison's study found fixtures associated with religious activities like aediculae in 17 of the 30 houses, including the far larger Casa del Menandro and such fixtures were found in five rooms there. Strocka's discussion of religious indications also include the niche found in the kitchen. But Allison points out that, although niches decorated with Lares-related scenes or containing small ritual sculptures have been found in a number of kitchens elsewhere in Pompeii, usually in structures without aediculae, the undecorated niches in the Casa del Principe di Napoli, as well as in other structures around Pompeii, could have served some other purpose.Allison 2004, pp. 50-51.

It was composed of prominent figures from science, law, education, and the government, and chaired by physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. Its purpose was to make recommendations regarding U.S. disarmament policy in the context of the Cold War. The panel's initial recommendation represented a last attempt to forestall the advent of thermonuclear weapons by urging the U.S. government to not undertake a first test of the hydrogen bomb.Bernstein, \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\", p. 133. This recommendation was not followed and the test went ahead as planned in the fall of 1952. The panel subsequently made a series of recommendations regarding U.S. policy towards nuclear weapons and relations with the Soviet Union. One recommendation, advocating that the U.S. government practice less secrecy and more openness towards the American people about the realities of the nuclear balance and the dangers of nuclear warfare, attracted the interest of the new Eisenhower administration and led to that administration's Operation Candor and Atoms for Peace initiatives during 1953. Background Following the first atomic bomb test by the Soviet Union in August 1949, there was an intense debate within the U.S. government, military, and scientific communities regarding whether to proceed with development of the far more powerful hydrogen bomb, a debate that was decided on January 31, 1950, when President Harry S. Truman gave the order to go ahead with the new weapon.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, pp. 1, 62‚Äì65. At the time, creation of a thermonuclear device was by no means assured, since initial ideas for how to create one had proved unfruitful. However, beginning with the Teller‚ÄìUlam design breakthrough in March 1951, there was steady progress and by 1952 there were additional resources devoted to staging, and political pressure towards seeing, an actual test of a hydrogen bomb.Bernstein, \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\", pp. 137‚Äì139. Although defeated in January 1950, the opponents of the hydrogen bomb did not give up, instead continuing to fight a battle against the new weapon in different forms, and on different fronts, over the next several years.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, pp. 2, 151. The panel The creation of the Panel of Consultants on Disarmament was announced by the State Department on April 28, 1952. The panel was commissioned by Secretary of State Dean Acheson and its purpose was to advise the State Department and other federal agencies regarding U.S. disarmament policy and the U.S. role within the United Nations Disarmament Commission.Chernus, \\"Operation Candor\\", p. 781. In particular, the panel members met with officials from the State Department, the U.S. Department of Defense, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), as well as with U.S. representatives to the UN commission.\\"Oppenheimer and Bush Appointed to New Advisory Group on Disarmament\\", p. 133. The five members of the panel, and their organizational affiliations at the time of its establishment, were: * J. Robert Oppenheimer, Director, Institute for Advanced Study * Vannevar Bush, Carnegie Institution of Washington * John Sloan Dickey, President of Dartmouth College * Allen Dulles, Deputy Director of the Central Intelligence Agency * Joseph E. Johnson, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace The two most prominent members were Oppenheimer, a physicist who as head of the Los Alamos Laboratory had been a key figure in the Manhattan Project that created the U.S. atomic bomb, and Bush, an electrical engineer who as director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development had played a pivotal role in persuading the United States government to initiate said project. Both had been members of the group behind the Acheson‚ÄìLilienthal Report of 1946, an early proposal for international control of atomic weapons. Oppenheimer had chaired the General Advisory Committee to the AEC, which had issued a report opposing development of the hydrogen bomb, while Bush had remained always influential in nuclear policy discussions.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, pp. 41, 45‚Äì48, 92. Dickey and Johnson were both former State Department officials, and both had become believers in efforts towards international cooperation. Oppenheimer was selected as chair of the panel, and its executive secretary was McGeorge Bundy, at the time an associate professor of government at Harvard University.Bernstein, \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\", pp. 140‚Äì141. An article in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists said that the creation of the panel was \\"encouraging news, indicating at least some realization of the urgency of the general disarmament problem,\\" but added that it was hoped the panel could focus on the nuclear weapons aspect of the problem.Inglis, \\"The New Working Paper and U.S. Atomic Policy\\", p. 134. Report on timing of a thermonuclear test At the panel's second meeting, in May 1952, the members agreed to form a proposal that the first test of a thermonuclear weapon be postponed.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, p. 92. That test, known as Ivy Mike, had been scheduled well in advance,Rhodes, Dark Sun, p. 487. and was set to take place on November 1, 1952, on Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific (October 31, Washington time).Hewlett and Duncan, Atomic Shield, pp. 590‚Äì591. This would be just a few days before the November 4 holding of the United States presidential election, 1952, was to take place, in which Truman was not running for re- election.Rhodes, Dark Sun, p. 497. Bush brought the test postponement idea to Acheson verbally, saying it was improper to, just before an election, conduct a test which would leave an incoming administration in a more dangerous world that they had had no say in bringing about. Bush also argued that conducting a test would forestall the best chance of preventing that more dangerous world; instead, he and the panel favored the idea of a mutual test ban, on the grounds that it could be verified without intrusive inspections, as both nations had the ability to detect violations through atmospheric testing and other unilateral means.Bernstein, \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\", pp. 141‚Äì142. Meanwhile, with Bush and Oppenheimer as the leaders of the effort, the panel worked on a written report which would further explain its thinking.Bernstein, \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\", p. 143n31. The panel argued that a successful U.S. test would only encourage the Soviets to intensify their efforts towards an H-bomb, both out of an urgent need to match the American achievement and because a successful test would prove that a thermonuclear device was technically possible.Holloway, Stalin and the Bomb, p. 311. In propaganda terms, conducting a test would be to the disadvantage of the United States, since it would appear to be the country marching towards nuclear war. Militarily, the advent of hydrogen bombs on both sides could prove to be an overall negative for the United States, since the United States and its Western European allies had more targets within their territory that were suitable for attack by the hydrogen bomb than the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies did, and the Soviets could more effectively use their smaller amount of fissionable materials in H-bombs than they could in A-bombs. Most importantly, a conducted H-bomb test would represent a point of no return; whereas a test ban or delay would give everyone a chance to step back and think about whether they really wanted the world to go where it was headed (and since the United States had a big enough lead in A-bombs, it could afford to take that chance). The main argument against the panel's proposal was made to Acheson by Paul Nitze, the Director of Policy Planning in the State Department and a lead architect of the NSC 68 blueprint for the Cold War.Bernstein, \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\", p. 142. Nitze's logic was that if a test ban was to the advantage of the United States, the Soviets would use the ban to make up time in their weapons development work and then violate it by testing themselves.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, pp. 92‚Äì93. Nitze further argued that the ability to do effective unilateral monitoring of a test ban might not always exist, and that if an inspection regime became necessary, the Soviets would never accept it.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, p. 93. Finally Nitze thought that American development of the H-bomb ahead of the Soviets, combined with the existing American lead in A-bombs, might intimidate the Soviets into accepting a disarmament agreement. Another reason the panel gave for not conducting a U.S. test of a thermonuclear weapon was that such a test would produce radioactive debris, the capture and analysis of which would give Soviet scientists clues about the nature of the U.S. design and thus help them in their own efforts to develop a weapon.Holloway, Stalin and the Bomb, pp. 311‚Äì312. Scholars have disagreed on whether in fact the Soviets did gain any useful information from the Ivy Mike test when it occurred, but on balance it seems that Soviet detection and analysis equipment was insufficient to the task.Young and Schilling, Super Bomb, pp. 85, 180n85. The panel had little chance of any of their pleas succeeding in Washington, where they were almost completely lacking in political allies: some of those who had opposed the H-bomb in 1949 had since left positions of influence, while many others had changed their views and now supported it.Bernstein, \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\", pp. 145‚Äì148. The panel's formal report, \\"The Timing of the Thermonuclear Test\\", was submitted around early September 1952.Bernstein, \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\", p. 143. It gained few adherents, and at a meeting of the National Security Council in October 1952, the panel's suggestions were quickly dismissed by Acheson and Secretary of Defense Robert A. Lovett ‚Äì with Lovett even suggesting that papers on the proposal should be destroyed.Bernstein, \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\", pp. 148‚Äì149. President Truman never saw the panel's request for a test ban or delay, but if he had, there is little doubt he too would have rejected it.Bernstein, \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\", p. 151. There was a separate desire voiced for a very short delay, perhaps of two weeks, in the test, for reasons related to the test date being just before the presidential election date. Truman wanted to keep the thermonuclear test away from partisan politics but had no desire to order a postponement of it himself; however he did make it known that he would be fine if it was delayed past the election due to \\"technical reasons\\" being found.Hewlett and Duncan, Atomic Shield, p. 591. AEC commissioner Eugene M. Zuckert was sent to Enewetak to see if such a reason could be found, but weather considerations indicated it should go ahead as planned; and so Ivy Mike did, on the date intended.Rhodes, Dark Sun, pp. 497‚Äì498. A few days later, in a secret meeting at Augusta National Golf Club, President-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower was briefed on what had taken place; the report forwarded to him from the AEC stated in simple fashion that \\"The island ... which was used for the [test] ... is missing\\".Hewlett and Holl, Atoms for Peace and War, pp. 1, 3. Report on armaments and U.S. foreign policy On around January 9, 1953, the panel submitted to Acheson the main focus of its work, a final report titled \\"Armaments and American Policy\\". The report painted a bleak future in which both the United States and Soviet Union would expand their nuclear stockpiles to the point at which each side would have thousands of weapons and neither side could establish an effective superiority but both sides could effect terrible damage on the other. In particular, the current American nuclear superiority would soon disappear, because the Soviets would have \\"enough\\" bombs to cause horrible damage to American civilization, regardless of how many more such bombs the United States might possess and how badly it could destroy the Soviets. This concept of \\"enoughness\\" was something that Dulles in particular was concerned that the American public be informed about. The panel stated that \\"a world of this kind may enjoy a strange stability arising from general understanding that it would be suicidal to 'throw the switch' [but] a world so dangerous may not be very calm, [because] it will be necessary for statesmen to decide against rash action not just once, but every time.\\"Bundy, Danger and Survival, pp. 288‚Äì289. At root, the report felt, the fundamental problem raised by nuclear weapons was the need to avoid war, something humanity had never shown an ability to do.Rhodes, Dark Sun, p. 15. Nor was the report optimistic about the possibility of arms limitations agreements being reached between the two nations, given the vast differences between their politico-economic systems and the level of unbending deceitfulness with which the Soviet Union operated.Hewlett and Holl, Atoms for Peace and War, p. 42. The report was largely drafted by Oppenheimer and Bundy, but panel members Dickey and Johnson were especially influential in ensuring that the report conveyed these stark conclusions.Bundy, Danger and Survival, p. 674n119. In the report, the panel did make five overall recommendations:Bernstein, \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\", p. 154, including n75. * Reduction of nuclear secrecy and greater candor towards the American public * Improved communication with U.S. allies regarding nuclear matters * Attention to defense of the American continent against Soviet air attack * Disengagement from the slogan-dominated UN nuclear disarmament discussions * Improved communications with the Soviet Union. Oppenheimer discussed and disseminated some of the report's conclusions during February 1953, first via an off-the- record speech at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and then by sending copies of that speech to some prominent journalists and analysts.Bernstein, \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\", p. 155. Several months later he published an article in Foreign Affairs magazine based on ideas in the Council speech. Despite the Panel of Consultants on Disarmament having been formed under a different administration of a different political party, the panel's members had sufficient knowledge, experience, and standing so as to attract attention to their report in the incoming Eisenhower administration.Bundy, Danger and Survival, p. 288. The panel document also benefited by being more directly and succinctly written than the average consultants' report.Hewlett and Holl, Atoms for Peace and War, p. 43. President Eisenhower became receptive to some of the ideas of the report and asked his National Security Council staff to read it.Hewlett and Holl, Atoms for Peace and War, pp. 43‚Äì44. The recommendation that Eisenhower responded most favorably to was the one for greater openness on nuclear issues.Bernstein, \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\", p. 156. This directly led to the creation of Operation Candor, which was intended as a public relations campaign to inform the U.S. public of the facts as to the armaments race ‚Äì including the realities of Soviet nuclear capabilities and the dangers they posed to America ‚Äì and thereby get the public out of a state of atomic apathy.Chernus, \\"Operation Candor\\", pp. 793‚Äì794. The panel's report also triggered a desire by Eisenhower to seek a new and different approach to the threat of nuclear war in international relations,Hewlett and Holl, Atoms for Peace and War, p. 212. one that would give some measure of hope to the American public despite the realities of \\"enoughness\\".Chernus, \\"Operation Candor\\", pp. 780, 800‚Äì801. This desire was part of what led to Eisenhower's \\"Atoms for Peace\\" speech in December 1953.Bundy, Danger and Survival, pp. 290, 292‚Äì293.Chernus, \\"Operation Candor\\", p. 806. On the whole, however, Eisenhower did not treat the push for candor as part of an overall plan for disarmament, as the panel's report had intended, but rather as a goal in and of itself.Chernus, \\"Operation Candor\\", p. 792. Indeed, the Eisenhower administration's \\"New Look\\" defense posture emphasized a greater dependence on strategic nuclear weapons, as part of concern for balancing Cold War military commitments with the nation's financial resources.Chernus, \\"Operation Candor\\", p. 805. Legacy While the panel's existence was known to highly informed members of the public, its full report was not made public at the time.Hewlett and Holl, Atoms for Peace and War, p. 53. Attention to the panel by historians has been intermittent.Bernstein, \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\", p. 134n7. Soviet development of the hydrogen bomb proceeded on its own, determined course, which culminated in August 1953 with a partial thermonuclear test and then in November 1955 with a successful aircraft drop of a true thermonuclear weapon.Holloway, Stalin and the Bomb, pp. 306‚Äì308, 314‚Äì317. The Soviet accomplishments were based on its own scientific work and did not gain information from the U.S. program; nor was it likely that the Soviets would have responded positively to any proposal to ban tests of the new weapon.Holloway, Stalin and the Bomb, pp. 317‚Äì319. The panel's conclusions regarding the strategic nuclear balance and its concomitant dangers were prescient. As McGeorge Bundy wrote decades later, \\"In the world of the 1980s, when we have lived with thermonuclear stalemate for a generation, [the panel's] analysis is familiar. At the time it was both startling and chilling.\\"Bundy, Danger and Survival, p. 289. Oppenheimer's stances in the panel, first in unsuccessfully urging a postponement of the initial test and then in somewhat successfully advocating for general openness toward the public on nuclear matters, ended up being to his detriment.Bernstein, \\"Crossing the Rubicon\\", pp. 157‚Äì158.Hewlett and Holl, Atoms for Peace and War, pp. 44‚Äì45. Those in the U.S. government who had long held suspicions about Oppenheimer's judgment and loyalties used these stances as additional fuel, and by the end of 1953 the wheels were in motion that would lead to the Oppenheimer security hearings the following year and the resultant loss of Oppenheimer's security clearance.Hewlett and Holl, Atoms for Peace and War, pp. 44‚Äì53. Those actions against Oppenheimer were part of even greater effort, led by AEC commissioner Lewis Strauss, to rewrite post-World War II American nuclear history to find supposed villains who had delayed and obstructed the U.S. development of the hydrogen bomb.Young and Schilling, pp. 133‚Äì147.

Currently he is a National Deputy in the Argentine Congress representing the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires. He is a member of the center-right Cambiemos coalition.  Personal life  In 1970, Fernando Iglesias joined the Trotskyist Socialist Party of the Workers (Spanish: Partido Socialista de los Trabajadores, abbrev. PST) [es], where he saw Juan Carlos Coral [es] and Nora Ciapponi run for president in the 1973 elections. He would later leave the PST and join the Front of Workers for Human Rights (Spanish: Frente de Trabajadores por los Derechos Humanos) to devote himself to human rights advocacy. He attended the School of Competitive Sports (Spanish: Licenciado en Alto Rendimiento Deportivo) at the National University of Lomas de Zamora, where he trained to become a volleyball player. He moved to Italy post-graduation to play volleyball and resided there for several years. Iglesias returned to Argentina in the mid-1990s and started to work as a truck driver and teach languages and tango. In the meantime, he studied Journalism at the Taller Escuela Agencia [es], where he became interested in globalization. He had written as a columnist for various Argentine newspapers including La Naci√≥n, Clar√≠n, and the magazine Noticias. He had also served as a freelance Buenos Aires correspondent for several European media outlets. He later became a professor at the University of Business and Social Sciences [es], where he taught the Theory of Globalization and Trade Blocs (Spanish: Teor√≠a de la Globalizaci√≥n y Bloques Regionales). He also taught at the Chair of International Governance (Spanish: la c√°tedra de Gobernabilidad Internacional del Doctorado de Sociolog√≠a) at the University of Belgrano.  Political career  From October 2007 to December 2011, Iglesias served as a National Deputy for the center- right Civic Coalition party. A critic of Argentina‚Äôs media laws, Iglesias joined the Freedom of Expression Committee. He argued that previous reforms made to the media laws were far from sufficient and that the parliamentary debate was excessively short. In 2011, he pushed for a bill that would lead to the nationwide implementation of single ballot voting, which proponents say would prevent ballot theft. He sponsored several bills that would see the creation a national registry of missing individuals, a plan to democratize the trade unions, a plan to oversee social work, and modifications to the civil code on issues like gender-motivated violence and religious liberty. In 2017, a lawyer close to then-president Mauricio Macri invited Iglesias to join Macri‚Äôs Cambiamos (Change) front. Macri highly appreciated Iglesias‚Äô passionate speeches in television debates and encouraged to run for the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of the Argentine Congress. In the same year, Iglesias ended up running for National Deputy for Cambiamos and won with over 50% of the votes. He then joined the Commission of Social Security and Forecasting (Spanish: Comisi√≥n de Previsi√≥n y Seguridad Social).  Political positions  Iglesias is a firm critic of former Argentine presidents N√©stor Kirchner and his wife Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner. He opposed the South American Union's decision to appoint N√©stor as the general secretary and accused Cristina of ruling a country of \\"mafiasos and hooligans\\" (Spanish: mafias y patotas).

It is roughly the equivalent of to the American National Defense University in Washington, D.C.  Overview  The NDRU was established on 28 January 2016. It was founded on the basis of the Institute for National Strategic Studies of the Ministry of Defence. The project for the establishment of NDRU in Armenia was elaborated and reviewed at the US National Defense University in 2003-2004 during Colonel Hayk Kotanjian's fellowship. The goal of the University is to increase the efficiency of the Armenian defense security system through bridging research and educational activities as well as to produce research in the areas of regional security dynamics and cyber security among others. In the course of its activities, NDRU has developed close academic-educational ties with world leading centers in security policy realm, notable, the US National Defense University, Harvard University, the Moscow State institute of International Relations, the Russian Presidential Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, Jean Moulin University Lyon 3, and the Chatham House.  NDRU Structure  The general structure of the NDRU includes two parts: the Drastamat Kanayan Institute for National Strategic Studies and the Academic- Publishing Center. = Drastamat Kanayan Institute for National Strategic Studies = The Drastamat Kanayan Institute for National Strategic Studies (INSS) was established in 2005 within the frameworks of the National Defense Research University as the research component of the university, being its organizational backbone. The INSS has continued its activities within the university since it was established in 2016. In 2006, the INSS was the academic coordinator of the inter-agency strucutre of Armenia‚Äôs first national security strategy. The INSS is the only state funded think tank. It consists of two parts: the Center for Regional Strategic Analyses and the Center for National Security Policy and Information-Communication. = Academic- Publishing Center and Haikakan Banak = Lieutenant General Hayk Kotanjian in November 2011. The Academic-Publishing Center is one of the sub-units located at the NDRU. It facilitates the promulgation of the advanced defense-academic thought as well as the publication of NDRU research. Haikakan Banak is the defense-academic journal of the NDRU and the entire armed forces. It was established on 11 October 1994, by then Defense Minister Serzh Sargsyan‚Äôs order on the recommendation of the First Deputy Defense Minister and Chief of the General Staff Norat Ter-Grigoryants. The process of creating the journal were assigned to Colonel Hayk Kotanjian.

In 1976, she became the first female scout in the National Football League (NFL), working in the New York Jets' scouting department from 1976 to 1980. Early years Carberg's father, Calvin Nicholas, was the Jets' team doctor from 1962 to 1987, and her uncle, James A. Nicholas, was a team orthopedist credited with saving Joe Namath's career. Carberg grew up in Babylon, New York, and made mock drafts as a hobby. She played college basketball at Wheaton College for two years before transferring to Ohio State University. While at Ohio State, she received permission from head football coach Woody Hayes to attend team practices. She graduated in 1974 with a degree in home economics. Professional career Carberg intended to become a high school teacher after graduation, but Hayes recommended that she consider a career in sports. New York Jets head coach Charley Winner met her at a party hosted by her father Calvin and convinced her to join the team as a receptionist. The team allowed her to make the final selection in the 1975 NFL Draft, and she chose tight end Mark Bartoszek from Ohio State in the 17th round. After seeing her abilities to judge players on their skills, in 1976, the Jets' general manager Al Ward gave her a full-time position in the scouting department and she became the NFL's first female scout. She worked under directors of player personnel Homer Edington, Mike Holovak, and Mike Hickey during her time with the team. She was known as \\"The Girl Scout\\" by other Jets front office staff members. In her first season, Carberg was assigned to scout Big Ten Conference football players for the Jets, and traveled to games and practices. Beginning in 1977, she was unable to scout on the road like the other members of the department due to owner Leon Hess' hesitation in having a woman continue to perform those tasks. Instead, she graded players' game film and interviewed prospects from the team offices as a personnel assistant. Carberg helped the Jets evaluate Mark Gastineau before the 1979 NFL Draft. The team was coaching in the Senior Bowl and needed another defensive lineman on the roster due to an vacancy, so Carberg called several prospects before suggesting Gastineau to be the replacement based on a phone conversation with him. He was projected to be an eighth round draft pick at the time, but due to his performance in the Senior Bowl and other pre-draft processes, the Jets selected him in the second round and he became the NFL's all-time sack leader. She was also credited with helping the Jets in their selection of two-time Pro Bowl selection Wesley Walker, who was blind in one eye, in the second round of the 1977 NFL Draft. After football After the 1980 NFL season, she married John Carberg. She moved with him to Coral Springs, Florida, so he could take a job with Toyota, and she became a housewife. She has two children. In July 2000, Carberg was named director of public relations for the Toyota dealership in Coconut Creek, Florida. She was the director of the Coral Springs Basketball Recreation League for 15 years and worked as a counselor at a youth basketball camp. In 2017, she wrote a book titled X's and O's Don't Mean I Love You about her experiences as the first female NFL scout.

The collective formed originally in 1977 as a group of black South African artists mutually invested in regional liberation struggles and resistance to South Africa‚Äôs apartheid policy of racial segregation (1948-1994). Medu‚Äôs members, or ‚Äúcultural workers‚Äù as they preferred to be called, eventually organized and relocated to Gaborone, Botswana in 1978. With the support of the African National Congress (ANC), in Gaborone Medu officially registered as a cultural organization with the Botswanan government. Medu means ‚Äúroots‚Äù in the Northern Sotho language, and so describes the collective's underground operations (in defiance of the apartheid government's ban on oppositional political parties and organizations). The collective‚Äôs cultural work was rhizomatic in nature, stretching across seven semi-autonomous units: Film, Graphics, Music, Photography, Poetry, Publishing and Research, and Theatre. In Gaborone, Medu organized concerts, conducted art and creative writing workshops, produced films, organized public health campaigns, and mounted exhibitions among other activities. The collective also produced agitational newsletters and political posters, both of which sought to simultaneously bolster regional solidarity, critique the injustices of the apartheid state, and promote black consciousness. One of Medu's flagship events was the 1982 Culture and Resistance Festival and Symposium, which brought thousands of activists, cultural workers, and ordinary people together (from across Africa, the Americas, and Europe) for a week of concerts, exhibitions, talks, workshops and other forms of radical cultural programing. This massive undertaking brought greater attention to Medu's activism, heightening in particular the apartheid government's scrutiny of collective's work. Medu disbanded in 1985, following the South African Defence Force's murderous Raid on Gaborone, which resulted in the death of twelve people, including Medu members Mike Hamlyn, Thamsanga Mnyele, George Phahle, and Lindi Phahle.  Members  As a multiracial collective of cultural workers, Medu comprised more than sixty visual artists, performers, and writers who, despite their different backgrounds and ideological positions, were collectively invested in regional liberation and resistance to apartheid rule. Although most members were South African, many hailed from Botswana, Canada, Cuba, Sweden, and the United States of America. Members of the collective included Gwen Ansell, Theresa Devant, Sergio-Albio Gonz√°lez, Jonas Gwangwa, Basil Jones, Michael Kahn, Heinz Klugg, Keorapetse Kgositsile, Adrian Kohler, Mandla Langa, Hugh Masekela, Gordon Metz, Thamsanqa Mnyele, Judy Seidman, Mongane Wally Serote, Pethu Serote, and Tim Williams, among many others.  Posters  Medu played a formative role in shaping the visual culture of resistance in South Africa during the late 1970s and early 1980s along with other key printmaking initiatives such as Junction Avenue, Screen Training Project, and Cape Town Arts Project. Operating both contemporaneously with and after Medu, these collectives also issued posters to inform and galvanize their compatriots, countering the disinformation campaigns and ideologies promulgated by the apartheid government. The first of Medu's six units to emerge was Publications and Research, which served as the collective‚Äôs mouthpiece and administrative organ by generating the collective's meeting minutes, quarterly newsletters, and other publications. This unit operated symbiotically with the Graphics Unit, which designed covers for the newsletters and produced the posters for which Medu is best known. Medu produced over 100 posters during its lifetime, using a range of printing techniques including offset lithograph and screen printing. The iconography found across the collective's posters partakes of an international socialist and revolutionary lexicon of broken chains, clenched fists, upraised arms, and heroic depictions of activists and freedom fighters. This symbolism originated in World War I‚Äìera labor and anti-oppression movements across the world and was expressed in the work of Soviet and antifascist poster makers, Mexican muralists and print workshop members, and participants in the Harlem Renaissance‚Äîall of whom Medu graphic artists acknowledged as sources of inspiration.Judy Seidman, \\"The Art of National Liberation: The Thami Mnyele and Medu Art Ensemble Retrospective\\" in Clive Kellner and Sergio-Albio Gonzalez, eds., Thami Mnyele + Medu Art Ensembe (Johannesburg: Jacana, 2008) 89. The posters were often folded inside of newsletters and clandestinely smuggled into South Africa where they were often posted in public spaces before being torn down by state police or censors. Numerous examples of Medu's posters appeared on official censorship registries in accordance with apartheid state's 1974 Publications Act which outlined materials the regime deemed \\"undesirable,\\" or potentially threatening to apartheid law; during the 1980s, newspapers such as the Rand Daily Mail ran columns on censored material, many of which included Medu's posters and newsletters. Medu's posters range in their content. Posters intended for South African audiences forcefully scrutinized the pernicious mechanism and brutality of apartheid through bold imagery and slogans, while others promoted the various cultural activities Medu's Film, Photography, Theatre, and Music units organized in Gaborone. The posters were typically produced through dialogue among Medu's participants, with individual or groups of members contributing to different designs before presenting proposals to the entire collective for approval. While posters for temporal-specific events such as concerts were often produced in short runs, others with evergreen political content were issued in the hundreds, especially in the lead up to the collective's 1982 Culture and Resistance Festival and Symposium where posters were given out to attendees.  Exhibitions  Medu's work has been the subject of several exhibitions. In 2008, the Johannesburg Art Gallery mounted the exhibition Thami Mnyele + Medu Art Ensemble, which centered on the work of Thamsanqa (Thami) Mnyele and his contribution's to Medu's Graphics Unit. This comprehensive exhibition brought together artwork by Mnyele, a substantial collection of Medu's posters, and archival documents, media, and ephemera attesting to the collective's cultural programming and tragic dissolution. Medu's posters were included in the 2011 exhibition, Impressions from South Africa,1965 to Now at the Museum of Modern Art, New York. In 2019, the Art Institute of Chicago organized The People Shall Govern! Medu Art Ensemble and the Anti-Apartheid Poster, the first exhibition on Medu's work in North America.

Written as an ode to Crenshaw's hometown at the time, New York City, the song features a melody inspired by Babs Cooper's version of \\"Honest I Do,\\" a record that Crenshaw had heard in his childhood. Released on Field Day 1983, the song also served as the title track to a \\"US Remix\\" EP released in the UK the same year‚ÄîCrenshaw later panned the remixes for watering down the production. The song has since seen positive critical reception.

Crenshaw said that the topic of New York City was something he \\"could seize on back then.\\" Melodically, \\"Our Town\\" was inspired by Babs Cooper's version of the Innocents' song \\"Honest I Do,\\" a song that Crenshaw remembered listening to at his house when he was young.

The song was released on his 1982 debut album, Marshall Crenshaw. Written from the perspective of trying to console someone, the song's title was not based on a specific girl. The song's hook was described by Crenshaw as going for a \\"hypnotic\\" effect and the song features layered 12-string guitar parts. \\"Mary Anne\\" was not released as a single. Despite this, it has since become one of Crenshaw's most famous songs, seeing positive critical reception and becoming a live favorite. Background \\"Mary Anne\\" originated from the titular name; Crenshaw explained, \\"I had the idea to write a song called 'Mary Anne,' that was the first thing. Just kinda the way the word rolls out of my mouth was a good thing.\\" The song was not written with anyone in mind‚ÄîCrenshaw recalled, \\"I didn‚Äôt really know anybody named Mary Anne.

It's a big, massive, buzzing wall of 12-string guitars.\\" Release and reception \\"Mary Anne\\" was first released on the Marshall Crenshaw album in 1982.

Their population numbers have been declining over the years, and the species is recognized as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List.https://www.wwfindia.org/about_wwf/priority_species/lesser_known_species/olive_ridley_turtle/?https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259361152_Important_nesting_habitats_of_olive_ridley_turtles_Lepidochelys_olivacea_along_the_Andhra_Pradesh_coast_of_eastern_India On the Visakhapatnam coast, the society conducted research about the species by using surveying and documentation programmes. This research found that sporadic nesting occurs from January to March and that the mortality rate has increased, with the major cause being incidental capture of adult turtles in gill and trawl fishing nets operated by mechanized boats. Other reasons include artificial illumination along the coastline, sand mining, pollution by domestic sewage, chemicals, oil, plastics and building debris, planting of exotic species on the beaches, human predation of eggs and meat, predation of hatchlings by crows, kites, seagulls and feral dogs. In an attempt to moderate the decline in population numbers, the development of important conservation measures have been taken. These include strict enforcement of bans on nearshore mechanized fishing and operation of gill nets, shore-seine and lines during breeding and nesting seasons; use of turtle excluder devices (TED) in trawl nets; the initiation of beach patrolling; stopping of construction and development activities on the beachside; promoting in-situ conservation; establishing more hatcheries; and creating awareness among people, fishermen, forest officials, students and NGOs.Rama Murty, M.
