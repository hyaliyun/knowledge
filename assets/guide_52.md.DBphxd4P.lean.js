It was a venue for adults in the cabaret as well as having a children's theater for patrons of all ages to see and enjoy magic.  Importance  The Magic Towne House became a popular magic show spot in New York City, with the longest continuously running magic shows in New York City's history. For fifteen years it showcased both new and established magicians to the general public. It was in the posh area of the Upper East Side of Manhattan on Third Avenue and 61st Street next to Bloomingdale's Department Store.  Operation  It was headed up by world class magicians Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brooks. According to William Dorfliinger's book The Magic Catalogue: Dick Brooks and Dorothy Dietrich were \\"involved in the management and direction of all its activities.  Incubator for young magicians  One of the goals of the establishment was to develop future generations of magicians. Originally opened by Eddie Davis, it was taken over by two professional performers, Dick Brooks (entertainer) and Dorothy Dietrich. They encouraged new and unknown performers by allowing them to perform after the main acts had gone on. Some of the magicians who got their early start at The Magic Towne House includes Robert Baxt, Michael Chaut, Devlin, Eric DeCamps, Imam, Jeff Justice, Peter Kougasian, Landis & Company, Levent, Jeff McBride, Charlie Mount, Otto and George, Johnny Ace Palmer, Joeseph Pepitone, Joe Raven, David Regal, Tom Frank, Rocco Silano, Peter Samelson, and Meir Yedid. Along with these great entertainers behind the scenes was Pedro Flores who at the time a High School student in New York, helped with children's parties and other events serving the buffet items and setting up and cleaning afterward. He was from time to time a performer as well. He was a student of Dick Brooks when Brooks taught at the Frank Garcia's School of Magic in New York City.  Venue for established magicians  Established performers of the era also performed there such as Bobby Baxter, Harry Blackstone, Jr., Milbourne Christopher, Daryl, Fantasio, Frank Garcia, Walter B. Gibson, Earl Presto Johnson, Lou Lancaster, Jack London, Bill McQueen, Max Mavin (Phil Goldstein), Ben Robinson, James Randi, Richard Robinson, Wesley James, David Roth, Darwin Ortiz, George Schindler, Slydini and countless others. Imam would, after several years, break away and form his own competing club downtown in Greenwich Village.  Legacy  Opening a magic show venue in New York City had been a dream of many famous magicians, such as Houdini, Thurston and Doug Henning. This was finally accomplished with the efforts of Eddie Davis, Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brooks (entertainer) and the help of many who worked this venue. Dick Brooks also searched out Brother Theodore, whose career had waned, to do several seasons of midnight shows, and helped to bring him back to prominence. After that Theodore appeared on The Tom Snyder Tomorrow Show and a long series of TV and movie appearances. Magic Towne House advertisements appeared in local New York newspapers such as the Village Voice and The New York Post.Magic Towne House advertisement in local New York newspapers. After the closing of the Magic Towne House, Michael Chaut and Peter Samelson went on to develop \\"Monday Night Magic\\" along with Frank Brents, Todd Robbins, and Jamy Ian Swiss, which still runs successfully in New York City.

Chemical Factory Kalk) was a German chemicals company based in Kalk, a city district of Cologne. The company was founded in 1858 as Chemische Fabrik Vorster & Gr√ºneberg, C√∂ln by Julius Vorster and Hermann Julius Gr√ºneberg and was renamed to Chemische Fabrik Kalk GmbH in 1892. At times the company was the second-largest German producer of soda ash and was, with almost 2400 employees, one of the largest employers in Cologne. For decades the chimneys and the water tower of the factory dominated the skyline of Cologne-Kalk. In 1960 the company was acquired by the Salzdetfurth AG, which was later renamed into Kali und Salz (nowadays K+S) and became a subsidiary of BASF. All production facilities of the former Chemische Fabrik Kalk were closed in 1993, and the name Chemische Fabrik Kalk since then exists only as the name of a wholesale subsidiary of K+S. The factory was demolished and after the decontamination of the premises the new Cologne police departments headquarters and the K√∂ln Arcaden shopping mall were built on the former factory premises. History =Chemiewerk Vorster & Gr√ºneberg (1858-1891)= On 1 November 1858 the merchant Julius Vorster and the chemist and pharmacist Hermann Julius Gr√ºneberg, who was a doctoral student at that time, founded the Chemische Fabrik Vorster & Gr√ºneberg, C√∂ln. Vorster, who had owned a chemical factory before, contributed 15,000 Thaler and Gr√ºneberg contributed 5,000 Thaler. As a location for the new factory they chose what was then the small village of Kalk (incorporated into Cologne in 1910) on the right bank of the Rhine. After purchasing the premises of the former iron foundry Biber & Berger construction began and three months later, in February 1859 production started. The factory produced potassium nitrate and as a byproduct sodium carbonate (also known as soda ash). Potassium nitrate was used in food preservation and in the production of black powder. The potassium nitrate was produced from Russian potash and nitratine. From 1859 to 1864 production of potassium nitrate increased from to . In the first year the factory employed ten workers., Vorster & Gr√ºneberg Chemische Fabriken in Kalk, Sta√üfurt und Leopoldshall (1858-1877) Chemische Fabrik Kalk in 1859. As the new company flourished several adjacent lots were purchased in 1860 to expand the production facilities and to maintain the regional market leadership in potassium nitrate. With prices for Russian potash increasing, the factory began to use a by-product of the sugar production from sugar beet. In 1860 the factory also began to produce sodium chloride, which was crystallized from rock salt. To secure a supply of rock salt the factory founders Vorster and Gr√ºneberg acquired a salt mine in Sta√üfurt near Magdeburg., Die Sta√üfurter Abraumsalze (1858-1862) The area was known for its deposits of a double salt, a compound of potassium chloride and magnesium chloride named carnallite after its discoverer, the Prussian mining engineer Rudolf von Carnall. The new salt mine Vorster & Gr√ºneberg was rich in deposits of carnallite. Gr√ºneberg developed a new chemical process to produce potassium chloride from carnallite. Initially the carnallite was transported from Sta√üfurt to Kalk where it was dissolved in a current of stream and after cooling down the carnallite crystallized to obtain potassium chloride. To reduce transport costs the two founders decided to build two potassium chloride factories in Sta√üfurt and Leopoldshall where they had acquired a second salt mine. In 1860 Gr√ºneberg finished his doctoral studies and received a Ph.D. from the University of Leipzig. His research was in the field of agricultural chemistry, in particular mineral fertilizers., Die mineralische D√ºngung in der Landwirtschaft (1861) In 1864 the factory began the production of the fertilizer superphosphate, produced from phosphorite from a newly acquired mine in Nassau an der Lahn. One year later the production of the fertilizer ammonium sulfate begins. In 1866 the factory begins to use the Leblanc process to produce potassium carbonate from sodium chloride. During the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, the company was awarded a gold medal for having first manufactured Potash and Potash salts, according to Leblanc's process, on a manufacturing scale , and for the purity of the products exhibited. The company continued to expand, with a factory producing ammonium sulfate opening in 1865 in Raderberg near Cologne (incorporated into Cologne in 1888). This factory produced the ammonium sulfate from ammonia and sulfuric acid, the latter a waste product of the production of town gas. As the new factory was highly profitable, Vorster & Gr√ºneberg opened new ammonium sulfate factories in Nippes, Cologne (incorporated into Cologne in 1888), D√ºsseldorf, Essen, Dortmund, Hamburg, Leipzig and Saint Petersburg and an ammonium chloride factory in Moscow. Chemische Fabrik Kalk in 1892. In 1867 the company incurred financial losses from a bad investment in the United Kingdom and declining demand for its products. In the same year Julius Vorster Jr., the son of the founder Julius Vorster, became involved in the management of the company. On his recommendation the company began to produce magnesium sulfate in order to reduce the losses. Magnesium sulfate was primarily intended for the export to the United Kingdom, where it was used as a drying agent in the textile industry. The new product and an improving market for potassium nitrate helped the company to overcome the financial crisis in 1870. In 1871 the potassium chloride factory in Sta√üfurt was closed. On 1 October 1875 the second son of Vorster, the chemist Fritz Vorster joined the company as technical director. After the death of the founder Julius Vorster on 10 October 1876, the new owners converted the company into a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft). In 1878 Carl Scheibler became the head of the fertilizer department. Scheibler introduced an inexpensive fertilizer known as Thomas phosphate. This fertilizer was based on Thomas slag, named after Sidney Gilchrist Thomas. This new, inexpensive fertilizer allowed even poor farmers to fertilize their fields. At the same time municipalities began to use the waste products of the production of town gas for themselves or were selling them for profits, forcing Vorster & Gr√ºneberg to gradually close their ammonium sulfate factories at other locations over the next fifteen years. In contrast, the factory in Kalk continued its expansion with new production facilities for sulfuric acid and nitric acid opening in 1881. In 1885 Carl Scheibler founded his own company, D√ºngerfabrik C. Scheibler & Co, with the participation of the owners of Vorster & Gr√ºneberg. This company produced Thomas phosphate and other fertilizers in domestic and international production facilities. =Chemische Fabrik Kalk GmbH (1892-1945)= On 24 May 1892 the Vorster & Gr√ºneberg Kommanditgesellschaft was renamed into Chemische Fabrik Kalk GmbH (CFK) and converted into a company with limited liability (GmbH). It was one of the first limited liabilities companies in the German Empire as the law on companies with limited liabilities was adopted only one month earlier. On 7 June 1894 the last surviving founder Hermann Julius Gr√ºneberg dies. His son Richard Gr√ºneberg succeeds him and joins the management board of the company. After 1900 the production of potassium carbonate ceased due to competitive pressure. Instead, the company began to produce sodium carbonate using the Solvay process. In 1902 the D√ºngerfabrik C. Scheibler & Co. was incorporated, and a year later the last remaining factory in the Sta√üburg region, the potassium chloride factory in Leopolshall was sold. To guarantee the water supply in the main factory in Kalk a water tower with an integrated chimney and a height of was built. This water tower should dominate the skyline of Kalk for the next one hundred years. Chemische Fabrik Kalk in 1908. At the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the company on 1 November 1908 the Chemische Fabrik Kalk produced the following chemicals: ammonium hydroxide, ammonium chloride, ammonia, sodium hydroxide, sodium sulfate, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, sodium carbonate and various fertilizers. Apart from the main factory in Kalk the company operated an ammonia factory in Cologne-Nippes and fertilizer factories in Cologne- Ehrenfeld and Euskirchen. The company was also one of the owners of the coal dstillation plant Ammonium GmbH in Weitmar near Bochum and held interests in domestic and international Thomas steel mills producing slag. Total production of all chemicals combined was . In 1908 the company employed more than 1200 workers. With the outbreak of World War I employment fell to 70 workers and parts of production were shut down, as the company was not producing essential chemicals for the war economy. Management then concentrated on the production of saltpeter, a raw material for explosives. Due to the importance of the chemical the workforce increased to 504 employees in December 1914. In 1916 an explosives research laboratory was created, and a short time afterwards the first explosive agent was developed. Despite the lack of workers the company also expanded into the new market for animal food by treating straw with sodium hydroxide. After the end of the war the treaty of Versailles forced Chemische Werke Kalk to end the production of explosives and close the research laboratory. In the 1920s demand for fertilizers slowly increased, but was accompanied by an increase in prices for raw materials. To mitigate the effect of the price increases the company began to produce a fertilizer based on ammonium nitrate and calcium carbonate, two by-products of the production of other fertilizers. In 1930 Scheibler‚Äôs Kampd√ºnger (Kamp standing for Kalk- Ammon-Phospor, i.e. lime-ammonium-phosphorus and D√ºnger being the German word for fertilizer) was introduced, a two-component fertilizer that was readily accepted by the market. The company management at this time considered moving the factory from Kalk to Godorf in Rodenkirchen as the high population density made expansion of the factory difficult. Ultimately this plan was not implemented. After the Hitler's rise to power in 1933 the company gradually began to concentrate on raw materials for the production of explosives. Since 1937 women were employed as workers. After the outbreak of World War II, with the maleworkforce in military service, women were conscripted for work at the company. Since 1940 Chemische Fabrik Kalk used approximately 460 forced laborers from Poland and later the Soviet Union. The factory was heavily damaged during the bombing raids which started in 1942. In 1943 the sulfuric acid plant was completely destroyed, a year later almost all of the production came to a standstill. On 6 March 1945 the grandson of the founder, Fritz Vorster Jr. closed the factory after 80 percent of the production facilities had been destroyed. At this time the company had only 100 employees. =Acquisition by Salzdetfurth AG and factory closing (1945-1993)= In August 1945, only three months after the end of the war the Chemische Fabrik Kalk began to produce burnt lime for the purpose of bartering. Workers returning from war captivity cannibalized some sections of the plant to repair other sections. Some equipment and tools that were removed from the factory before the bombing raids were returned. In March 1946 the production of ammonium sulfate resumed. In 1947 large parts of the factory were rebuilt and in the summer of 1948 production of susperphosphate in September 1948 production of Kampd√ºnger resumed. As potash was added to the Kampd√ºnger it was sold as KAMPKA-D√ºnger (the ending KA standing for Kalisalz, the German word for potash). In 1950 the production of the company had reached the old pre-war production level and the company had a market share of 20 percent of the German market for sodium carbonate, although it decreased to 13 percent one year later. During this time the management again considered a move of the factory from Kalk to Godorf, but after a study concluded that a moving the factory would be more costly than staying in Kalk the already purchased land in Godorf was sold. In 1952 the Salzdetfurth AG acquired a 25 percent share of Chemische Fabrik Kalk and increased the share to 75 percent in 1957. The former water tower of Chemische Fabrik Kalk in 2007 At the centennial anniversary of the founding of the company on 1 November 1958 the company employed 1820 workers and 549 salaried professionals. A new production facility for phosphates was opened in 1960. In the same year the factory produced of KAMPKA fertilizer and of sodium carbonate. In 1960 the Salzdetfurth AG acquired the remaining 25 percent of Chemische Fabrik Kalk. After the takeover the Salzdetfurth AG began to modernize the production facilities and build for example a new, tall chimney that helped alleviate the odor pollution from sulfurous exhaust fumes. In the mid 1960s the fillings and loading plants were converted to fully automated operation. Despite these modernizations the factory equipment, in particular the sodium carbonate production facilities were outdated. The company also lacked new products that would have allowed the company to enter new markets. In 1971 the Salzdetfurth AG merged with the BASF subsidiary Wintershall and the Burbach-Kaliwerke AG. One year later the Salzdetfurth AG and Burbach-Kaliwerke AG and the sodium carbonate production facilities of Wintershall were merged into the new Kali und Salz AG. Under the new ownership Chemische Fabrik Kalk expanded into the production of flower and garden fertilizers. In 1974 the factory had 1800 employees, had a revenue of 400 million DM and was active in the production of sodium carbonate, calcium chloride, fine chemicals, phosphate for animal feed and fertilizers. In the early 1980s the factory tried to enter new markets with the production of bromine, but closed production after a fire destroyed the production facility only two weeks after completion in 1985. Due to increasing competition in the market for fertilizers and the lack of new products, company revenue fell from 570 million DM in 1985 to 370 million DM. The company posted increasing financial losses, partly due to its locational disadvantage as all raw materials and all final goods had to be transported by truck from the factory to Cologne's Rhine harbor. Another disadvantage was the location of the factory in a densely populated residential area and a decreasing acceptance of the pollution caused by the factory. Without operating profits a relocation of the factory was not feasible, and thus, without any prospects, the fertilizer production was shut down in 1989. Employment fell from 1400 employees in 1985 to 830 in 1990, with the factory only producing sodium carbonate, calcium chloride and phosphate for animal feed. Although losses were reduced to almost zero in 1990, the financial situation deteriorated in 1992 when the prices for sodium carbonate fell. The fall in prices was partly due to the lifting of anti-dumping on sodium carbonate imports from the American Natural Soda Ash Corporation (ANSAC) by the European Commission. Another factor in the worsening financial situation was an antitrust fine of US$1.38 million imposed by the European commission for participating in a sodium carbonate cartel together with Solvay and Imperial Chemical Industries. Company revenue fell to 225 million DM and losses increased to 9.6 million DM. On 23 December 1993 all remaining production was shut down and all remaining 700 workers were laid off. Since then Chemische Fabrik Kalk GmbH is the name of a wholesale distributor of chemicals and subsidiary of K+S AG (named Kali und Salz AG until 1999). Company revenue in 2007 was 7.86 million Euro, down from 10.07 million Euro in 2004. =Demolition and redevelopment of the factory site (1993-today)= The new Cologne police department headquarters. After the factory was closed all production facilities and factory buildings on the almost large premises were demolished. A small laboratory building and the water tower which had been listed as a historic landmark were preserved. The former office buildings on the southern side of the factory premises were sold. Equipment was sold to other factories, in for example Poland and Brazil. In October 1994 the tall chimney was blasted. The last building demolished was the fertilizer factory building dating from 1894 which is torn down in March 2001. As the premises were heavily contaminated with sulfur and heavy metals they had to be decontaminated from 1996 to 2001. New streets and an access road to the Zoobr√ºcke, a Rhine bridge were built. In 2003 the new Cologne police department headquarters were opened. In 2005 the K√∂ln Arcaden shopping mall opened, with the parking garage build around the historic water tower. Plans to open a Chemische Fabrik Kalk museum in the water tower have not been realized. In April 2009 the science center Odysseum will open, which will be the largest science center in Germany. Other planned projects include residential and office buildings, retail space and an urban park. The former factory site is today known under the official name Cityforum Kalk, or abbreviated CFK.

Biology The adults fly from May to June depending on the location. The larvae feed nocturnally on the tender shoots of oak (Quercus species) in July and August. It overwinters as a pupa in a tough cocoon of coarsely spun silk, dead leaves and soil. Distribution The lunar double-stripe is found in Central and Southern Europe, North Africa, Asia Minor and Kazakhstan. In Great Britain it is a scarce migrant. Frequent records from Sussex in the 1870s suggest it was once resident there and from 1947 moths, ova and larvae were regularly found in Orlestone Wood, Kent amongst oak coppice. Numbers declined from 1953 and the last record was in 1958; temporary residence is attributed to wartime coppicing and the consequent abundance of oak stools and fresh foliage.

In 1170 Sir Ralph de Bulmer received a royal charter confirming his ownership of the estate. King John granted William de Bulmer a licence to fortify their manor house in the year 1210. This would mean building in stone and marks the beginnings of the original castle as a fortified residence. In 1330 a Sir Ralph de Bulmer obtained a charter of his desmesne from King Edward III acknowledging his ownership of the estate. Sir Ralph carried out further alterations to the building and obtained a licence to crenellate from King Edward III allowing him to make the manor house into a castle. All estates including Wilton estate were forfeit to the crown following the attainder and execution of Sir John and Lady Bulmer on 25 May 1537, for high treason under the 1534 Act of Supremacy, arising out of their part in the Pilgrimage of Grace, in protest against King Henry VIII's break with the Roman Catholic Church. The manor was later restored to their nephew, Sir Ralph de Bulmer (d. 1558) by King Edward VI in 1547. In 1558 Queen Mary I granted the estate to Sir Thomas Cornwallis and the estate passed via his son and grandson to his great-grandson Lord Charles Cornwallis in 1698. Lord Cornwallis sold the estate in the early 1700s to Sir Stephen Fox. Sir Stephen's son by his second marriage was created Earl of Ilchester in 1747 and sold the estate the next year. The estate was purchased by the trustees of the will of a Robert Lowther for the benefit of (Sir) James Lowther (1736‚Äì1802), member of Parliament (1757‚Äì1784). Sir James Lowther became the first Earl of Lonsdale in 1784 and with his death in 1802 the Earldom of Lonsdale became extinct. = Demolition and rebuilding = The castle had been allowed to decay and by 1805 was largely a ruin. The estate was purchased in about 1806 by a cousin Sir John Lowther (1759‚Äì1844). Sir John Lowther demolished the remains of the medieval castle in about 1807, and in 1810 built an imposing mansion house on the site, to a design by architect Sir Robert Smirke. The first stage of the rebuilding of the castle was the building of the centre block, the west wing and a short low east wing and later in a second phase of building, an octagonal tower was added to the end of the east wing. The Gothick design includes a fifteen-bay frontage with a four-storey castellated tower at the centre, flanked by castellated and gabled bays and turrets and five-bayed two-storey wings. Lowther was created a Baronet in 1824 (see Lowther Baronets). The iron industry was founded in Middlesbrough by Bolckow and Vaughan followed by the chance discovery in 1850 of iron ore in the Eston hills on land that the Lowthers owned. One area of farmland was rented to Bolckow and Vaughan for ¬£17,700 pa and this change of fortunes funded later redevelopment work. Sir Charles Hugh Lowther, 3rd Baronet (1803‚Äì1894) inherited the family baronetcy from his brother in 1868. The whole of the east wing including the octagonal tower was later demolished and replaced by 1887 with amongst other rooms a pavilion ballroom to create essentially the building that exists today. Farmhouses and outbuildings on the estate were also demolished and rebuilt for tenants followed by the building of a new village of Wilton out of sight of the castle, and the main road was moved further away from the front of the castle. On the death of the third Baronet in 1894 the Baronetcy passed to his grandson but the Wilton Castle estate passed to his younger son James Lowther (1840‚Äì1904). James Lowther died at Wilton in 1904 and left the castle to his nephew Colonel John George Lowther. = Post War = Colonel Lowther sold the estate including Wilton Castle, his private residence in 1945 to Imperial Chemical Industries. In 1946 staff moved into Wilton Castle to plan the development of the estate as a chemical works. The estate was laid out as ICI Wilton and the whole of the castle was converted and used as offices due to restrictions at the time on building new offices. The offices were occupied at various times by major industrialists such as Dr Richard Beeching and Sir John Harvey Jones. Staff were transferred to new offices on the works site as restrictions were lifted, such that by 1969 the building had many empty offices, but still had dining facilities and bedrooms for visitors, and a staff club. In 1970 ICI carried out internal modifications and invited Trust House to manage the facilities. The park had been developed as a golf course for ICI staff and was sold in 1999. The golf club was acquired by its members, and over the period 2001‚Äì2002 Wilton Castle was converted by George Wimpey Ltd into 45 luxury apartments and houses. = Current status = There is no remaining evidence of the building of 1210, but internal walls to the east of the entrance are particularly thick and it is thought they constituted part of the original tower. Wilton Castle was given grade II listed building status in 1952. As well as the castle the associated stable block, garden wall, and retaining wall are grade II listed buildings.  Cultural references  The castle was used as a location in the BBC television drama series Spender (1991).

Updated: Apr 30, 2010 The fracture continues sagittally through the vertebral body, and is associated with deformity of the body and subluxation or dislocation of the facet joints at the injured level.https://radiopaedia.org/articles/flexion- tear-drop-fracture; retrieved 05-23-2018 A flexion teardrop fracture is usually associated with a spinal cord injury, often a result of displacement of the posterior portion of the vertebral body into the spinal canal. The flexion teardrop fracture should not be confused with a similar-looking vertebral fracture called \\"extension teardrop fracture\\". Both usually occur in the cervical spine, but as their names suggest, they result from different mechanisms (flexion-compression vs. hyperextension). Both are associated with a small fragment being broken apart from the anteroinferior corner of the affected vertebra. Flexion teardrop fractures usually involve instability in all elements of the spine at the injured level, commonly occur at the C4-C7 vertebra, and have a high association with spinal cord injury (in particular anterior cord syndrome). In comparison, the extension-type fracture occurs more commonly at C2 or C3, causes less if any disruption to the middle and posterior elements, and does not usually result in spinal cord injury (however it may co-occur with more dangerous spine injuries). https://radiopaedia.org/articles/flexion-tear-drop-fracture; retrieved 05-23-2018https://radiopaedia.org/articles/extension-tear-drop-fracture-1; retrieved 05-23-2018 References Category:Bone fractures Category:Orthopedic problems ","title":"Flexion teardrop fracture"},{"id":"20110420","text":"20 Dates is a 1998 American mockumentary film.

Charles created him a baronet in recognition of his services, but his capture during the English Civil War led to his estate being sequestered. Life Morgan was one of the Morgan family of Llantarnam in Monmouthshire, Wales, an established Roman Catholic family: his great-grandfather William Morgan was a Member of Parliament in the reigns not only of the Catholic Queen Mary but also of the Protestant Queen Elizabeth, and allowed his house to be used for the celebration of mass. Morgan's parents were Thomas* Morgan and Frances, daughter of Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester, and both supported Catholic activities in Wales. He was educated at Jesus College, Oxford, matriculating in 1616 and obtaining his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1619. He was involved in the Welsh Jesuit headquarters being set up in 1635 in Cwm, Llanrothal, Herefordshire. He was commissioned in the second Bishops' War in 1640 and given permission to obtain contributions from fellow Catholics. This caused controversy in the Long Parliament, and Charles I's reaction was to make Morgan a baronet in 1642; he later renewed Morgan's commission during the English Civil War. Morgan was captured at Hereford on 18 December 1645. The Rump Parliament removed his baronetcy and his estate was sequestered. He died on 24 June 1653; it was not until 9 November 1654 that his estate was discharged. His heir, Sir Edward Morgan, 2nd Baronet, became a Protestant. The Baronet title fell to his son Sir Edward Morgan, 3rd Baronet until his death, he was without male heirs and the Baronet title then went to his uncle: Sir James Morgan, 4th Baronet of Llantarnam, James was the younger son of Morgan and was the last Baronet of Llantarnam. *Note: At Edward Somerset, 4th Earl of Worcester one finds that the husband of Frances Somerset is listed as William Morgan, esq. of Llantarnam, not Thomas Morgan.

Note the wing tags used for population monitoring. An endangered species is a species that is very likely to become extinct in the near future, either worldwide or in a particular political jurisdiction. Endangered species may be at risk due to factors such as habitat loss, poaching and invasive species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List lists the global conservation status of many species, and various other agencies assess the status of species within particular areas. Many nations have laws that protect conservation-reliant species which, for example, forbid hunting, restrict land development, or create protected areas. Some endangered species are the target of extensive conservation efforts such as captive breeding and habitat restoration.  Conservation status  Photo of Pusa hispida saimensis, also known as Saimaa Ringed Seal, from 1956. Living only in Lake Saimaa, Finland, Saimaa Ringed Seals are among the most endangered seals in the world, having a total population of only about 400 individuals. The conservation status of a species indicates the likelihood that it will become extinct. Many factors are considered when assessing the status of a species; e.g., such statistics as the number remaining, the overall increase or decrease in the population over time, breeding success rates, or known threats. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species is the best-known worldwide conservation status listing and ranking system. Over 50% of the world's species are estimated to be at risk of extinction. Internationally, 195 countries have signed an accord to create Biodiversity Action Plans that will protect endangered and other threatened species. In the United States, such plans are usually called Species Recovery Plans.  IUCN Red List  The Siberian tiger is an Endangered (EN) tiger subspecies. Three tiger subspecies are already extinct (see List of carnivorans by population). Blue-throated macaw, an endangered species Brown spider monkey, an endangered species Siamese crocodile, an endangered species American burying beetle, an endangered species Kemp's ridley sea turtle, an endangered species Mexican Wolf, the most endangered subspecies of the North American Grey Wolf. Approximately 143 are living wild. Though labeled a list, the IUCN Red List is a system of assessing the global conservation status of species that includes \\"Data Deficient\\" (DD) species ‚Äì species for which more data and assessment is required before their situation may be determined ‚Äì as well species comprehensively assessed by the IUCN's species assessment process. Those species of \\"Near Threatened\\" (NT) and \\"Least Concern\\" (LC) status have been assessed and found to have relatively robust and healthy populations, though these may be in decline. Unlike their more general use elsewhere, the List uses the terms \\"endangered species\\" and \\"threatened species\\" with particular meanings: \\"Endangered\\" (EN) species lie between \\"Vulnerable\\" (VU) and \\"Critically Endangered\\" (CR) species. In 2012, the IUCN Red List listed 3,079 animal and 2,655 plant species as endangered (EN) worldwide.  Endangered species in the United States  There is data from the United States that shows a correlation between human populations and threatened and endangered species. Using species data from the Database on the Economics and Management of Endangered Species (DEMES) database and the period that the Endangered Species Act (ESA) has been in existence, 1970 to 1997, a table was created that suggests a positive relationship between human activity and species endangerment. A proportional symbol map of each state's endangered species count. =Endangered Species Act= \\"Endangered\\" in relation to \\"threatened\\" under the ESA. Under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 in the United States, species may be listed as \\"endangered\\" or \\"threatened\\". The Salt Creek tiger beetle (Cicindela nevadica lincolniana) is an example of an endangered subspecies protected under the ESA. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, as well as the National Marine Fisheries Service are held responsible for classifying and protecting endangered species. Also, they are also responsible for adding a particular species to the list can be a long, controversial process (Wilcove & Master, 2008, p. 414). Some endangered species laws are controversial. Typical areas of controversy include criteria for placing a species on the endangered species list and rules for removing a species from the list once its population has recovered. Whether restrictions on land development constitute a \\"taking\\" of land by the government; the related question of whether private landowners should be compensated for the loss of uses of their areas; and obtaining reasonable exceptions to protection laws. Also lobbying from hunters and various industries like the petroleum industry, construction industry, and logging, has been an obstacle in establishing endangered species laws. The Bush administration lifted a policy that required federal officials to consult a wildlife expert before taking actions that could damage endangered species. Under the Obama administration, this policy has been reinstated. Being listed as an endangered species can have negative effect since it could make a species more desirable for collectors and poachers. This effect is potentially reducible, such as in China where commercially farmed turtles may be reducing some of the pressure to poach endangered species. Another problem with the listing species is its effect of inciting the use of the \\"shoot, shovel, and shut-up\\" method of clearing endangered species from an area of land. Some landowners currently may perceive a diminution in value for their land after finding an endangered animal on it. They have allegedly opted to kill and bury the animals or destroy habitat silently. Thus removing the problem from their land, but at the same time further reducing the population of an endangered species. The effectiveness of the Endangered Species Act ‚Äì which coined the term \\"endangered species\\" ‚Äì has been questioned by business advocacy groups and their publications but is nevertheless widely recognized by wildlife scientists who work with the species as an effective recovery tool. Nineteen species have been delisted and recovered and 93% of listed species in the northeastern United States have a recovering or stable population. Currently, 1,556 known species in the world have been identified as near extinction or endangered and are under protection by government law. This approximation, however, does not take into consideration the number of species threatened with endangerment that are not included under the protection of such laws like the Endangered Species Act. According to NatureServe's global conservation status, approximately thirteen percent of vertebrates (excluding marine fish), seventeen percent of vascular plants, and six to eighteen percent of fungi are considered imperiled.Wilcove & Master 2008. Thus, in total, between seven and eighteen percent of the United States' known animals, fungi and plants are near extinction. This total is substantially more than the number of species protected in the United States under the Endangered Species Act. Bald eagle American bison Ever since mankind began hunting to preserve itself, over- hunting and fishing have been a large and dangerous problem. Of all the species who became extinct due to interference from mankind, the dodo, passenger pigeon, great auk, Tasmanian tiger and Steller's sea cow are some of the more well known examples; with the bald eagle, grizzly bear, American bison, Eastern timber wolf and sea turtle having been poached to near- extinction. Many began as food sources seen as necessary for survival but became the target of sport. However, due to major efforts to prevent extinction, the bald eagle, or Haliaeetus leucocephalus is now under the category of Least Concern on the red list. A present-day example of the over- hunting of a species can be seen in the oceans as populations of certain whales have been greatly reduced. Large whales like the blue whale, bowhead whale, finback whale, gray whale, sperm whale, and humpback whale are some of the eight whales which are currently still included on the Endangered Species List. Actions have been taken to attempt a reduction in whaling and increase population sizes. The actions include prohibiting all whaling in United States waters, the formation of the CITES treaty which protects all whales, along with the formation of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). But even though all of these movements have been put in place, countries such as Japan continue to hunt and harvest whales under the claim of \\"scientific purposes\\". Over-hunting, climatic change and habitat loss leads in landing species in endangered species list. It could mean that extinction rates could increase to a large extent in the future.  Invasive species  The introduction of non- indigenous species to an area can disrupt the ecosystem to such an extent that native species become endangered. Such introductions may be termed alien or invasive species. In some cases, the invasive species compete with the native species for food or prey on the natives. In other cases, a stable ecological balance may be upset by predation or other causes leading to unexpected species decline. New species may also carry diseases to which the native species have no resistance.  Conservation  The dhole, Asia's most endangered top predator, is on the edge of extinction. =Captive breeding= Captive breeding is the process of breeding rare or endangered species in human controlled environments with restricted settings, such as wildlife reserves, zoos, and other conservation facilities. Captive breeding is meant to save species from extinction and so stabilise the population of the species that it will not disappear. This technique has worked for many species for some time, with probably the oldest known such instances of captive mating being attributed to menageries of European and Asian rulers, an example being the P√®re David's deer. However, captive breeding techniques are usually difficult to implement for such highly mobile species as some migratory birds (e.g. cranes) and fishes (e.g. hilsa). Additionally, if the captive breeding population is too small, then inbreeding may occur due to a reduced gene pool and reduce resistance. In 1981, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) created a Species Survival Plan (SSP) to help preserve specific endangered and threatened species through captive breeding. With over 450 SSP Plans, some endangered species are covered by the AZA with plans to cover population management goals and recommendations for breeding for a diverse and healthy population, created by Taxon Advisory Groups. These programs are commonly created as a last resort effort. SSP Programs regularly participate in species recovery, veterinary care for wildlife disease outbreaks, and some other wildlife conservation efforts. The AZA's Species Survival Plan also has breeding and transfer programs, both within and outside of AZA - certified zoos and aquariums. Some animals that are part of SSP programs are giant pandas, lowland gorillas, and California condors. =Private farming= Black rhino Southern bluefin tuna Whereas poaching substantially reduces endangered animal populations, legal, for-profit, private farming does the opposite. It has substantially increased the populations of the southern black rhinoceros and southern white rhinoceros. Dr Richard Emslie, a scientific officer at the IUCN, said of such programs, \\"Effective law enforcement has become much easier now that the animals are largely privately owned... We have been able to bring local communities into conservation programs. There are increasingly strong economic incentives attached to looking after rhinos rather than simply poaching: from Eco-tourism or selling them on for a profit. So many owners are keeping them secure. The private sector has been key to helping our work.\\"He's black, and he's back! Private enterprise saves southern Africa's rhino from extinction, The Independent, June 17, 2008 Conservation experts view the effect of China's turtle farming on the wild turtle populations of China and South-Eastern Asia ‚Äì many of which are endangered ‚Äì as \\"poorly understood\\". Although they commend the gradual replacement of turtles caught wild with farm-raised turtles in the marketplace ‚Äì the percentage of farm-raised individuals in the \\"visible\\" trade grew from around 30% in 2000 to around 70% in 2007\\"Turtle farms threaten rare species, experts say \\". Fish Farmer, 30 March 2007. Their source is an article by James Parham, Shi Haitao and two other authors, published in February 2007 in the journal Conservation Biology. ‚Äì they worry that many wild animals are caught to provide farmers with breeding stock. The conservation expert Peter Paul van Dijk noted that turtle farmers often believe that animals caught wild are superior breeding stock. Turtle farmers may, therefore, seek and catch the last remaining wild specimens of some endangered turtle species. In 2009, researchers in Australia managed to coax southern bluefin tuna to breed in landlocked tanks, raising the possibility that fish farming may be able to save the species from overfishing.The Top 10 Everything of 2009: Top 10 Scientific Discoveries: 5.

History The Pemberton and Hightstown Railroad was chartered in 1864 and completed in 1868; it linked the towns of Pemberton and Hightstown, a total of .See Brinckmann, John. \\"Pemberton and Hightstown: A Chronicle of Railroading Through the Farm Belt of New Jersey\\" (1987, Brinkmann). This detailed history was privately printed but is sometimes available on Amazon or rare book sites. The first President of the Pemberton and Hightstown Railroad was Nathaniel Scudder Rue, Jr., who lived in Cream Ridge, NJ (he also founded the first national bank in New Jersey, The First National Bank of Hightstown). Most of the stock was purchased by the Camden and Amboy Railroad, and as such they were the owners of the line. The line was first leased to the Camden and Amboy in 1868, then the PRR through its acquisitions. In 1888 the Union Transportation Company was created to run the line, and the lease was terminated with the PRR, although they still owned the line. In 1915, the PRR merged the Pemberton and Hightstown Railroad into the Pennsylvania and Atlantic Railroad, a holdings company which included other local lines. By 1942, the UT was unable to operate the line, and contracted with the PRR to run the daily operations again. Eventually the PennCentral ran the line until 1976, until the PC merged into Conrail. The Pemberton and Hightstown Railroad, and the Union Transportation Company as operator, was not to be included in Conrail, and thus was independent and on their own. The line lasted until 1977, when due to financial problems, they ceased to exist. The Monmouth County Park System opened a section of the Union Transportation Trail (between Millstream Road and Jonathan Holmes Road) with a gravel surface on the right- of-way on September 25, 2010. A 2.0 miles (3.2 km) extension to Davis Station Road was completed in 2011. In February 2015, the section between County Route 526 (New Jersey) and Herbert Road/Sharon Station Road (3.0 miles (4.8 km)) had been completed, with a new parking lot and trailhead at Herbert Road and Sharon Station Road. Construction commenced in 2015 on the fourth segment (1.5 miles (2.4 km)) between County Route 526 (New Jersey) and Davis Station Road, and was completed in September 2016. The fifth segment (0.75 miles (1.21 km)) between Herbert Road/Sharon Station Road and County Route 539 (New Jersey) was completed in late January 2017 and passes through the Assunpink Wildlife Management Area. Towns, stations, and facilities The line started in Pemberton, New Jersey, in 1868 where it had a connection with the Burlington and Camden County Railroad (1867). This gave them a connection to Mt. Holly and Camden. The next stop it passed through was Shreve, which had a passenger shelter measuring , as well as a smaller milk shelter and platform. Then Lewistown, where a wye and crossover allowed interchange with the Columbus, Kinkora, Springfield RR (1872). This would become the Kinkora Branch of the PRR many years later. There was a large freight house here, measuring , as well as Cattle Pen, and storage tracks just south of the wye. Continuing on, the line ran through Wrightstown, which exploded during World War I when Fort Dix was built. This location had a big wire fence around the station grounds, with two milk platforms (one large, one small), large coal trestle, and a cattle pen. The Wrightstown freight station measured , while the passenger station measured . The line would continue through Cookstown, which included a milk platform and cattle pen, and a passenger station, and a freight house. In New Egypt the Union Transportation Company would set up its offices in 1888. New Egypt would house the shops, turntable, and water tower for the UT. The passenger station was the largest on the line, measuring , while the freight house measured . The UT's office building measured . The location had a cattle pen, the Engine house at , including a large coal trestle and a coal shed, with a locomotive coaling platform, engine pit, and a turntable. Hornerstown would be next, which would also include a turntable. The passenger station was , as the freight house was . The complementary cattle pen and milk platform would be included. Cream Ridge had a wire fence around the property, with a passenger station and freight house. The complementary cattle pen and milk platform would be included. Davis also had the cattle pen and milk platform, but only a passenger station, although larger at . This was considered a combination freight passenger station. Imlaystown had a slightly smaller passenger station of , and a freight house of . Cattle pen included, but no milk platform listed. Shrewsbury was listed as a stop, which only included a milk platform. Sharon had the standard passenger station and freight station, with cattle pen and milk platform. The last stop before Hightstown, Allens would only include a milk platform. Hightstown was the final terminus, where they shared the station with the C&A.; Construction and operations *1864 - the Burlington and Camden County Railroad had extended their tracks from Mt. Holly to Pemberton by 1868. Milk and Fertilizer (marl) were beginning to become profitable businesses in the surrounding communities in and around the New Egypt area. The Pemberton & Hightstown was granted incorporation by the State of New Jersey on March 24, 1864. The Camden & Amboy RR assisted the P&H; in construction of the line. *1865 - P&H; agrees to lease the line to the C&A;, once finished. Construction was started at both ends at the same time, with teams working north from Pemberton and south from Hightstown. *1868 - track laying completed on January 16, near Hornerstown, after which the construction crew's celebration became disorderly and a riot broke out. When opened, the line had up to four scheduled passenger trains per day. *1871 - the C&A; is absorbed into the United Companies, which in turn was absorbed by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). As such, the P&H; was officially run under the auspices of the PRR. *1872 - George Westinghouse's triple valve air brake system was first used on the Amboy Division of the PRR and tested on the P&H.; This system set brakes when the main system was broken or pressure dropped. A test was performed at Pemberton in which two cars were deliberately uncoupled and halted as intended. *1874 - Marl surfaced as one of the carrier's first bulk commodities; 14,856 tons are transported by rail to stations on the P&H; and the C&A.; *1887 - the PRR officially purchases the guaranteed stock and bonds of the P&H.; *1888 - the board of directors of the P&H; decided to cancel the lease to PRR for operating purposes and closing all traffic on the P&H; with the exception of daily mail service (which they may have been obligated to deliver per US Government agreements). This causes a problem with local residents and industries who were used to regular service for the shipment of milk and other farm products. A few months later, local railroad men and business heads got together to raise enough money and on July 31, 1888 began the Union Transportation Company (UT) with its headquarters in New Egypt, New Jersey. The P&H; would now lease the line to the UT for daily operations. *1890s - 1900s - uneventful; little change. Mostly mixed train service reported, with a regular routine of LCL freight. Typical freight included milk, cranberries, hay, and straw. Freight extras ran to accommodate excess loading of gravel, and later potato and tomato crops for Campbell Soup Company in Camden, New Jersey. The line was never very profitable, with a very high percentage of its revenue coming from passengers. An agreement dated July 31, 1896, sets rental at $1,389 per year, payable to the PRR. *1910s - traffic on the UT peaks. Passenger usage is up and LCL freight was going strong. The line was as busy as it was ever going to be at this time period. The local communities were growing and thus increasing the demand for passenger services. Farming was becoming a bit more efficient, increasing the demand for inbound and outbound agricultural products, as well as general merchandise for the industry. The stations were busy, the platforms filled with cattle and milk, and increases in express freight kept things moving at a steady pace. *1915 - the PRR merged a number of their local holdings into a larger single corporation to reduce costs and overhead. The P&H;, along with the Philadelphia and Long Branch Railroad Company and the Kinkora and New Lisbon Railroad, were merged to form the Pennsylvania and Atlantic Railroad Company. As far as daily operations went, the Union Transportation company was still the lessee and still ran the trains on the P&H; part. This merger into the P&A; was more of a centralization on the PRR's part, allowing them to consolidate reporting, taxes, and other business functions at the corporate level. *1917 - Fort Dix Air Force Base is constructed near Wrightstown; this causes the town of Wrightstown to grow almost overnight. This was initially good for the UT, as some extra business and passengers could now be expected, but the Government and Fort Dix made a deal with the PRR to exclusively give them all freight traffic. The PRR retained trackage rights into Fort Dix over the UT, and the sum of $600 per month was given to the UT for use by the PRR. This is interesting to note, since in 1896, the UT was paying the PRR rent of $1,389 per year for rent *1920 - inflation and the loss of freight and passengers begin to takes its toll on the UT. Surrounding roads are better maintained, automobiles become more reliable, and farmer begin to use tractors over horses and other animals; trucks are able to make quicker deliveries. As a result, much of the UTs local traffic began to quickly fade. LCL shipments were down, and every year, fewer and fewer passengers would take the trains. The passenger business was such a high percentage of the UTs traffic, they would never recoup from loss of this business. Traffic still consisted of outbound milk and seasonal potato and tomato loading, but these, too, were on the decline. As an experiment to increase passenger traffic and reduce costs, an early internal combustion J.G. Brill Company doodlebug was bought by the UT around 1922, but this attempt failed. The unit was sold in July 1926. *1931 - Great Depression takes its toll on the UT. Passenger service quickly evaporated, and as such, the ICC would allow passenger service to end in 1931. Much of the remaining LCL freight would be ending by this point, leaving both the freight stations and passenger stations now empty and unused. Some would be rented out, but overall, the end of an era would soon be here. *1940s - operations of the UT are dismal, with old and dilapidated buildings and equipment. The line was in desperate need of maintenance and upgrades by this point. With the loss of the passenger traffic revenue in the 20s and 30s, the line could barely afford to keep itself running. Based upon freight revenues alone they could not afford to pay for upgrades and improvements now necessary. But by the 1940s, cars were getting bigger and heavier, and something would need to be done. The increase of traffic due to World War II was more than the UT could handle with their existing two ancient 4-4-0 engines, cars, and facilities. The point had come when the UT was unable to reliably and safely service the line. *1942 - UT contracts with PRR to operate the line. Of the two old, poorly maintained 4-4-0 American locomotives, one was immediately scrapped. *1945 - November: PRR brings in B8 switcher (number 2800). Coal was one of the largest commodities brought into service Fort Dix. Mostly carload freight was being shipped on the line by this point, with almost no need anymore for station and team track facilities. The remaining freight houses were a liability at this point, being very old and needing immediate attention. The freight house at Wrightstown was removed, and in Davis, the combination freight and passenger building was also removed. The Cream Ridge freight house was removed in January 1943. When the PRR took over operations, the much needed upgrades could take place, and the needed maintenance could finally be performed. Much of the line was upgraded from the original rail to rail, and several bridges were quickly upgraded. *1949 - construction of New Jersey Turnpike threatens to sever the line north of Shrewsbury Road four miles (6 km) south of Hightstown. The UT and local shippers tried to fight the break in the ROW, but failed. *1951 - segment between Shrewsbury Road and Hightstown abandoned and dismantled. *Mid-1950s - upper sections of the line continued to be abandoned by the PRR; increased coal shipments to Fort Dix, as well as increased shipments to Richard's Feed Mill at Davis, kept the line moving and profitable. *1959 - July 14th marked the last day of revenue service for the Pennsylvania Railroad‚Äôs vast steam locomotive program, ending with B6sb shifter #5244 operating under lease to Union Transportation Co. The locomotive was retired the following day in Philadelphia.[3] *1960s - full freight carloads continue, with companies such as Sanitary Bedding Company (later Agrico Farm Center), Richard's Feed Mill, and Northern Chemical Company being the largest shippers; line remains successful *1967 - coal no longer required in Fort Dix, hurting the line's business. *1968 - history nearly repeats itself when the construction of Interstate 195 nearly severs the line, isolating large shipper, Agrico Farm Center. However, New Jersey DOT relents and constructs overpass. The PRR and New York Central merge to become Penn Central (PC). The Penn Central eventually files for bankruptcy less than two years later. *Early 1970s - line was able to gain some extra revenue as it moved steel for the construction of I-195, as well as some more coal being delivered Fort Dix again. But as quickly as it started, the coal shipments ended, and the PC continued with its abandonment proceedings for most of the line. *1973 - two prospects for new business came about. The Stepan Chemical Company and the Cori Furniture Company were both looking for properties with rail access. The stigma of abandonment chased them away from the local area. One can only imagine how the situation would have changed if the Stepan Chemical Company moved in, as their plant in Maywood, New Jersey comprises with many spurs and sidings. The Final System Plan of 1973, which created Conrail and explained which lines and companies would be included, did not include the UT. Based upon that information, the PC planned to terminate operational service on February 27, 1976. Conrail was not going to help them, or run the trains for them. But, Conrail would continue to service Fort Dix, just as the PRR and PC did. *1975 - the PC amended its notice that the UT could continue to operate and transferred the Lewis-Fort Dix segment to the UT and canceled all agreements. Officially, the UT would be on their own again. To secure some funding to continue their operations, the UT tried to gain a subsidy from the United States Railway Association, which offered assistance to shortlines and the such. Operations continued in 1976 and even into 1977, with covered hoppers being delivered to Agrico, Agway at New Egypt, and Kube-Pak (a horticultural greenhouse business) at Imlaystown. *1977 - the UT was now working directly with the New Jersey Department of Transportation. The UT was out of cash, out of funding, and out of time. In 1977, NJDOT demanded that consignees come up with the funding to pay for operational losses on the UT. With no funding sources being found the line would have to close, since they could not pay their bills. The last shipment of empties was picked up on March 31, 1977 at Agrico. *1978 - Number 9999 was sold to Midwest Steel and Alloy company in Ohio. *1979 - line abandoned between stub end at Shrewsbury road and Fort Dix. Conrail would continue to only service Fort Dix, until 1981, using the old PRR trackage rights. *1984 - line abandoned between Fort Dix and current terminus of Mount Holly.

It is often denoted by the infinity symbol . Since the time of the ancient Greeks, the philosophical nature of infinity was the subject of many discussions among philosophers. In the 17th century, with the introduction of the infinity symbol and the infinitesimal calculus, mathematicians began to work with infinite series and what some mathematicians (including l'H√¥pital and Bernoulli) regarded as infinitely small quantities, but infinity continued to be associated with endless processes.The ontological status of infinitesimals was unclear, but only some mathematicians regarded infinitesimal as a quantity that is smaller (in magnitude) than any positive number. Others viewed it either as an artefact that makes computation easier or as a small quantity that can be made smaller and smaller until the quantity in which it is involved reaches eventually a limit. As mathematicians struggled with the foundation of calculus, it remained unclear whether infinity could be considered as a number or magnitude and, if so, how this could be done. At the end of the 19th century, Georg Cantor enlarged the mathematical study of infinity by studying infinite sets and infinite numbers, showing that they can be of various sizes. Extract of page 616 For example, if a line is viewed as the set of all of its points, their infinite number (i.e. the cardinality of the line) is larger than the number of integers. In this usage, infinity is a mathematical concept, and infinite mathematical objects can be studied, manipulated, and used just like any other mathematical object. The mathematical concept of infinity refines and extends the old philosophical concept, in particular by introducing infinitely many different sizes of infinite sets. Among the axioms of Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory, on which most of modern mathematics can be developed, is the axiom of infinity, which guarantees the existence of infinite sets. The mathematical concept of infinity and the manipulation of infinite sets are used everywhere in mathematics, even in areas such as combinatorics that may seem to have nothing to do with them. For example, Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem implicitly relies on the existence of very large infinite sets for solving a long-standing problem that is stated in terms of elementary arithmetic. In physics and cosmology, whether the Universe is infinite is an open question. History Ancient cultures had various ideas about the nature of infinity. The ancient Indians and Greeks did not define infinity in precise formalism as does modern mathematics, and instead approached infinity as a philosophical concept. =Early Greek= The earliest recorded idea of infinity may be that of Anaximander (c. 610 ‚Äì c. 546 BC) a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher. He used the word apeiron, which means \\"unbounded\\", \\"indefinite\\", and perhaps can be translated as \\"infinite\\". Aristotle (350 BC) distinguished potential infinity from actual infinity, which he regarded as impossible due to the various paradoxes it seemed to produce. It has been argued that, in line with this view, the Hellenistic Greeks had a \\"horror of the infinite\\"Maor, p. 3 which would, for example, explain why Euclid (c. 300 BC) did not say that there are an infinity of primes but rather \\"Prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of prime numbers.\\". It has also been maintained, that, in proving this theorem, Euclid \\"was the first to overcome the horror of the infinite\\". There is a similar controversy concerning Euclid's parallel postulate, sometimes translated :If a straight line falling across two [other] straight lines makes internal angles on the same side [of itself whose sum is] less than two right angles, then the two [other] straight lines, being produced to infinity, meet on that side [of the original straight line] that the [sum of the internal angles] is less than two right angles. Other translators, however, prefer the translation \\"the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely ...\\", thus avoiding the implication that Euclid was comfortable with the notion of infinity. Finally, it has been maintained that a reflection on infinity, far from eliciting a \\"horror of the infinite\\", underlay all of early Greek philosophy and that Aristotle's \\"potential infinity\\" is an aberration from the general trend of this period. =Zeno: Achilles and the tortoise= Zeno of Elea (c. 495 ‚Äì c. 430 BC) did not advance any views concerning the infinite. Nevertheless, his paradoxes, especially \\"Achilles and the Tortoise\\", were important contributions in that they made clear the inadequacy of popular conceptions. The paradoxes were described by Bertrand Russell as \\"immeasurably subtle and profound\\". Achilles races a tortoise, giving the latter a head start. :Step #1: Achilles runs to the tortoise's starting point while the tortoise walks forward. :Step #2: Achilles advances to where the tortoise was at the end of Step #1 while the tortoise goes yet further. :Step #3: Achilles advances to where the tortoise was at the end of Step #2 while the tortoise goes yet further. :Step #4: Achilles advances to where the tortoise was at the end of Step #3 while the tortoise goes yet further. Etc. Apparently, Achilles never overtakes the tortoise, since however many steps he completes, the tortoise remains ahead of him. Zeno was not attempting to make a point about infinity. As a member of the Eleatic school which regarded motion as an illusion, he saw it as a mistake to suppose that Achilles could run at all. Subsequent thinkers, finding this solution unacceptable, struggled for over two millennia to find other weaknesses in the argument. Finally, in 1821, Augustin-Louis Cauchy provided both a satisfactory definition of a limit and a proof that, for 0 < x < 1, :a + ax + ax2 \\\\+ ax3 \\\\+ ax4 \\\\+ ax5 \\\\+ ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ = . Suppose that Achilles is running at 10 meters per second, the tortoise is walking at 0.1 meter per second, and the latter has a 100-meter head start. The duration of the chase fits Cauchy's pattern with a = 10 seconds and x = 0.01. Achilles does overtake the tortoise; it takes him :10 + 0.1 + 0.001 + 0.00001 + ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ = = = 10 seconds. =Early Indian= The Jain mathematical text Surya Prajnapti (c. 4th‚Äì3rd century BCE) classifies all numbers into three sets: enumerable, innumerable, and infinite. Each of these was further subdivided into three orders: * Enumerable: lowest, intermediate, and highest * Innumerable: nearly innumerable, truly innumerable, and innumerably innumerable * Infinite: nearly infinite, truly infinite, infinitely infinite =17th century= In the 17th century, European mathematicians started using infinite numbers and infinite expressions in a systematic fashion. In 1655, John Wallis first used the notation \\\\infty for such a number in his De sectionibus conicis, and exploited it in area calculations by dividing the region into infinitesimal strips of width on the order of \\\\tfrac{1}{\\\\infty}. But in Arithmetica infinitorum (also in 1655), he indicates infinite series, infinite products and infinite continued fractions by writing down a few terms or factors and then appending \\"&c.;\\", as in \\"1, 6, 12, 18, 24, &c.;\\" In 1699, Isaac Newton wrote about equations with an infinite number of terms in his work De analysi per aequationes numero terminorum infinitas. Extract of p. 62 Mathematics Hermann Weyl opened a mathematico- philosophic address given in 1930 with: =Symbol= The infinity symbol \\\\infty (sometimes called the lemniscate) is a mathematical symbol representing the concept of infinity. The symbol is encoded in Unicode at and in LaTeX as \`\\\\infty\`. It was introduced in 1655 by John Wallis, and since its introduction, it has also been used outside mathematics in modern mysticism and literary symbology. =Calculus= Gottfried Leibniz, one of the co- inventors of infinitesimal calculus, speculated widely about infinite numbers and their use in mathematics. To Leibniz, both infinitesimals and infinite quantities were ideal entities, not of the same nature as appreciable quantities, but enjoying the same properties in accordance with the Law of Continuity. Real analysis In real analysis, the symbol \\\\infty, called \\"infinity\\", is used to denote an unbounded limit. The notation x \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty means that x increases without bound, and x \\\\to -\\\\infty means that x decreases without bound. For example, if f(t)\\\\ge 0 for every t, thenThese uses of infinity for integrals and series can be found in any standard calculus text, such as, * \\\\int_{a}^{b} f(t)\\\\, dt = \\\\infty means that f(t) does not bound a finite area from a to b. * \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t)\\\\, dt = \\\\infty means that the area under f(t) is infinite. * \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(t)\\\\, dt = a means that the total area under f(t) is finite, and is equal to a. Infinity can also be used to describe infinite series, as follows: * \\\\sum_{i=0}^{\\\\infty} f(i) = a means that the sum of the infinite series converges to some real value a. * \\\\sum_{i=0}^{\\\\infty} f(i) = \\\\infty means that the sum of the infinite series properly diverges to infinity, in the sense that the partial sums increase without bound. In addition to defining a limit, infinity can be also used as a value in the extended real number system. Points labeled +\\\\infty and -\\\\infty can be added to the topological space of the real numbers, producing the two-point compactification of the real numbers. Adding algebraic properties to this gives us the extended real numbers. We can also treat +\\\\infty and -\\\\infty as the same, leading to the one-point compactification of the real numbers, which is the real projective line. Projective geometry also refers to a line at infinity in plane geometry, a plane at infinity in three-dimensional space, and a hyperplane at infinity for general dimensions, each consisting of points at infinity. Complex analysis By stereographic projection, the complex plane can be \\"wrapped\\" onto a sphere, with the top point of the sphere corresponding to infinity. This is called the Riemann sphere. In complex analysis the symbol \\\\infty, called \\"infinity\\", denotes an unsigned infinite limit. x \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty means that the magnitude x of x grows beyond any assigned value. A point labeled \\\\infty can be added to the complex plane as a topological space giving the one-point compactification of the complex plane. When this is done, the resulting space is a one-dimensional complex manifold, or Riemann surface, called the extended complex plane or the Riemann sphere. Arithmetic operations similar to those given above for the extended real numbers can also be defined, though there is no distinction in the signs (which leads to the one exception that infinity cannot be added to itself). On the other hand, this kind of infinity enables division by zero, namely z/0 = \\\\infty for any nonzero complex number z. In this context, it is often useful to consider meromorphic functions as maps into the Riemann sphere taking the value of \\\\infty at the poles. The domain of a complex-valued function may be extended to include the point at infinity as well. One important example of such functions is the group of M√∂bius transformations (see M√∂bius transformation ¬ß Overview). =Nonstandard analysis= Infinitesimals (Œµ) and infinities (œâ) on the hyperreal number line (1/Œµ = œâ/1) The original formulation of infinitesimal calculus by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz used infinitesimal quantities. In the 20th century, it was shown that this treatment could be put on a rigorous footing through various logical systems, including smooth infinitesimal analysis and nonstandard analysis. In the latter, infinitesimals are invertible, and their inverses are infinite numbers. The infinities in this sense are part of a hyperreal field; there is no equivalence between them as with the Cantorian transfinites. For example, if H is an infinite number in this sense, then H + H = 2H and H + 1 are distinct infinite numbers. This approach to non-standard calculus is fully developed in . =Set theory= One-to-one correspondence between an infinite set and its proper subset A different form of \\"infinity\\" are the ordinal and cardinal infinities of set theory‚Äîa system of transfinite numbers first developed by Georg Cantor. In this system, the first transfinite cardinal is aleph-null (‚Ñµ0), the cardinality of the set of natural numbers. This modern mathematical conception of the quantitative infinite developed in the late 19th century from works by Cantor, Gottlob Frege, Richard Dedekind and others‚Äîusing the idea of collections or sets. Dedekind's approach was essentially to adopt the idea of one-to-one correspondence as a standard for comparing the size of sets, and to reject the view of Galileo (derived from Euclid) that the whole cannot be the same size as the part (however, see Galileo's paradox where he concludes that positive square integers are of the same size as positive integers). An infinite set can simply be defined as one having the same size as at least one of its proper parts; this notion of infinity is called Dedekind infinite. The diagram to the right gives an example: viewing lines as infinite sets of points, the left half of the lower blue line can be mapped in a one-to-one manner (green correspondences) to the higher blue line, and, in turn, to the whole lower blue line (red correspondences); therefore the whole lower blue line and its left half have the same cardinality, i.e. \\"size\\". Cantor defined two kinds of infinite numbers: ordinal numbers and cardinal numbers. Ordinal numbers characterize well-ordered sets, or counting carried on to any stopping point, including points after an infinite number have already been counted. Generalizing finite and (ordinary) infinite sequences which are maps from the positive integers leads to mappings from ordinal numbers to transfinite sequences. Cardinal numbers define the size of sets, meaning how many members they contain, and can be standardized by choosing the first ordinal number of a certain size to represent the cardinal number of that size. The smallest ordinal infinity is that of the positive integers, and any set which has the cardinality of the integers is countably infinite. If a set is too large to be put in one-to-one correspondence with the positive integers, it is called uncountable. Cantor's views prevailed and modern mathematics accepts actual infinity as part of a consistent and coherent theory. Certain extended number systems, such as the hyperreal numbers, incorporate the ordinary (finite) numbers and infinite numbers of different sizes. Cardinality of the continuum One of Cantor's most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum \\\\mathbf c is greater than that of the natural numbers {\\\\aleph_0}; that is, there are more real numbers R than natural numbers N. Namely, Cantor showed that \\\\mathbf{c} = 2^{\\\\aleph_0} > {\\\\aleph_0} (see Cantor's diagonal argument or Cantor's first uncountability proof). The continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinal number between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is, \\\\mathbf{c} = \\\\aleph_1 = \\\\beth_1 (see Beth one). This hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted Zermelo‚ÄìFraenkel set theory, even assuming the Axiom of Choice. Cardinal arithmetic can be used to show not only that the number of points in a real number line is equal to the number of points in any segment of that line, but also that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any finite-dimensional space. The first three steps of a fractal construction whose limit is a space-filling curve, showing that there are as many points in a one-dimensional line as in a two-dimensional square. The first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the tangent function, which provides a one-to-one correspondence between the interval (‚àíœÄ/2, œÄ/2) and R (see also Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel). The second result was proved by Cantor in 1878, but only became intuitively apparent in 1890, when Giuseppe Peano introduced the space-filling curves, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or cube, or hypercube, or finite-dimensional space. These curves can be used to define a one-to-one correspondence between the points on one side of a square and the points in the square. =Geometry and topology= Infinite-dimensional spaces are widely used in geometry and topology, particularly as classifying spaces, such as Eilenberg‚àíMacLane spaces. Common examples are the infinite-dimensional complex projective space K(Z,2) and the infinite-dimensional real projective space K(Z/2Z,1). =Fractals= The structure of a fractal object is reiterated in its magnifications. Fractals can be magnified indefinitely without losing their structure and becoming \\"smooth\\"; they have infinite perimeters‚Äîsome with infinite, and others with finite surface areas. One such fractal curve with an infinite perimeter and finite surface area is the Koch snowflake. =Mathematics without infinity= Leopold Kronecker was skeptical of the notion of infinity and how his fellow mathematicians were using it in the 1870s and 1880s. This skepticism was developed in the philosophy of mathematics called finitism, an extreme form of mathematical philosophy in the general philosophical and mathematical schools of constructivism and intuitionism. Physics In physics, approximations of real numbers are used for continuous measurements and natural numbers are used for discrete measurements (i.e. counting). Concepts of infinite things such as an infinite plane wave exist, but there are no experimental means to generate them.Doric Lenses ‚Äì Application Note ‚Äì Axicons ‚Äì 2. Intensity Distribution. Retrieved 7 April 2014. =Cosmology= The first published proposal that the universe is infinite came from Thomas Digges in 1576.John Gribbin (2009), In Search of the Multiverse: Parallel Worlds, Hidden Dimensions, and the Ultimate Quest for the Frontiers of Reality, . p. 88 Eight years later, in 1584, the Italian philosopher and astronomer Giordano Bruno proposed an unbounded universe in On the Infinite Universe and Worlds: \\"Innumerable suns exist; innumerable earths revolve around these suns in a manner similar to the way the seven planets revolve around our sun. Living beings inhabit these worlds.\\" Extract of p. 63 Cosmologists have long sought to discover whether infinity exists in our physical universe: Are there an infinite number of stars? Does the universe have infinite volume? Does space \\"go on forever\\"? This is an open question of cosmology. The question of being infinite is logically separate from the question of having boundaries. The two-dimensional surface of the Earth, for example, is finite, yet has no edge. By travelling in a straight line with respect to the Earth's curvature one will eventually return to the exact spot one started from. The universe, at least in principle, might have a similar topology. If so, one might eventually return to one's starting point after travelling in a straight line through the universe for long enough. Extract of p. 553 The curvature of the universe can be measured through multipole moments in the spectrum of the cosmic background radiation. To date, analysis of the radiation patterns recorded by the WMAP spacecraft hints that the universe has a flat topology. This would be consistent with an infinite physical universe. However, the universe could be finite, even if its curvature is flat. An easy way to understand this is to consider two- dimensional examples, such as video games where items that leave one edge of the screen reappear on the other. The topology of such games is toroidal and the geometry is flat. Many possible bounded, flat possibilities also exist for three-dimensional space. The concept of infinity also extends to the multiverse hypothesis, which, when explained by astrophysicists such as Michio Kaku, posits that there are an infinite number and variety of universes.Kaku, M. (2006). Parallel worlds. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. Logic In logic an infinite regress argument is \\"a distinctively philosophical kind of argument purporting to show that a thesis is defective because it generates an infinite series when either (form A) no such series exists or (form B) were it to exist, the thesis would lack the role (e.g., of justification) that it is supposed to play.\\"Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Second Edition, p. 429 Computing The IEEE floating-point standard (IEEE 754) specifies a positive and a negative infinity value (and also indefinite values). These are defined as the result of arithmetic overflow, division by zero, and other exceptional operations. Some programming languages, such as Java and J, allow the programmer an explicit access to the positive and negative infinity values as language constants. These can be used as greatest and least elements, as they compare (respectively) greater than or less than all other values. They have uses as sentinel values in algorithms involving sorting, searching, or windowing. In languages that do not have greatest and least elements, but do allow overloading of relational operators, it is possible for a programmer to create the greatest and least elements. In languages that do not provide explicit access to such values from the initial state of the program, but do implement the floating-point data type, the infinity values may still be accessible and usable as the result of certain operations. In programming, an infinite loop is a loop whose exit condition is never satisfied, thus theoretically executing indefinitely. Arts, games, and cognitive sciences Perspective artwork utilizes the concept of vanishing points, roughly corresponding to mathematical points at infinity, located at an infinite distance from the observer. This allows artists to create paintings that realistically render space, distances, and forms., Section 10-7, p. 229 Artist M.C. Escher is specifically known for employing the concept of infinity in his work in this and other ways. Variations of chess played on an unbounded board are called infinite chess.Infinite chess at the Chess Variant Pages An infinite chess scheme.\\"Infinite Chess, PBS Infinite Series\\" PBS Infinite Series,with academic sources by J. Hamkins (infinite chess: and ). Cognitive scientist George Lakoff considers the concept of infinity in mathematics and the sciences as a metaphor.

On their way to the Seaton Mansion, Brian stops at Warren Tyler's house to pick up his father, Bartholomew Seaton, and at the same time shows Ned a portrait of his late mother, Danielle Seaton, by the famous artist Lucien Beaulieu. The painting is in the possession of Mr. Tyler since he found it in a barn he bought. The friends leave for Seaton Mansion or \\"The Bat Hallow\\". They wear fancy dress for the Mardi Gras celebration. Later that evening they go to the Silver Yacht Club. That night the portrait is stolen. The prime suspect is Mr. Seaton, who is supposed to have wanted his wife's portrait. All the evidence points to him: he was wearing a bat costume, like the thief, and he was missing at the crucial time, around 10:00 p.m. Nancy cannot resist the challenge of the mystery. Her investigation leads to the French Quarter where she sees a woman who looks like Danielle except that her face is scarred. She is shocked and hypothesizes that Danielle could have survived the sailboat accident. Later she finds out the woman is Mariel Devereaux, whose father Max is an art forger. Nancy concludes that Max used his daughter as a model for the painting because of her almost perfect resemblance to Danielle. He purposely left it in the barn so that it would be found by Mr. Tyler, Danielle's suitor and Bartholomew's rival. His plan was to steal his own painting and ransom it for a million dollars. The money was to pay for his daughter's plastic surgery.

The first object in this relation is said to refer to the second object. It is called a name for the second object. The second object, the one to which the first object refers, is called the referent of the first object. A name is usually a phrase or expression, or some other symbolic representation. Its referent may be anything ‚Äì a material object, a person, an event, an activity, or an abstract concept. References can take on many forms, including: a thought, a sensory perception that is audible (onomatopoeia), visual (text), olfactory, or tactile, emotional state, relationship with other, spacetime coordinate, symbolic or alpha-numeric, a physical object or an energy projection. In some cases, methods are used that intentionally hide the reference from some observers, as in cryptography. References feature in many spheres of human activity and knowledge, and the term adopts shades of meaning particular to the contexts in which it is used. Some of them are described in the sections below. Etymology and meanings The word reference is derived from Middle English ', from Middle French r√©f√©rer, from Latin referre, \\"to carry back\\", formed from the prefix re- and ferre, \\"to bear\\".Klein, Ernest, A comprehensive etymological dictionary of the English language, Vol II, Elsevier publishing company, Amsterdam, 1969, p.1317 A number of words derive from the same root, including refer, referee, referential, referent, referendum. The verb refer (to) and its derivatives may carry the sense of \\"link to\\" or \\"connect to\\", as in the meanings of reference described in this article. Another sense is \\"consult\\"; this is reflected in such expressions as reference work, reference desk, job reference, etc  Semantics  The triangle of reference, from the influential book The Meaning of Meaning (1923) by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards. In semantics, reference is generally construed as the relationships between nouns or pronouns and objects that are named by them. Hence, the word \\"John\\" refers to the person John. The word \\"it\\" refers to some previously specified object. The object referred to is called the referent of the word. Sometimes the word-object relation is called \\"denotation\\"; the word denotes the object. The converse relation, the relation from object to word, is called \\"exemplification\\"; the object exemplifies what the word denotes. In syntactic analysis, if a word refers to a previous word, the previous word is called the \\"antecedent\\". =Meaning= Gottlob Frege argued that reference cannot be treated as identical with meaning: \\"Hesperus\\" (an ancient Greek name for the evening star) and \\"Phosphorus\\" (an ancient Greek name for the morning star) both refer to Venus, but the astronomical fact that '\\"Hesperus\\" is \\"Phosphorus\\"' can still be informative, even if the \\"meanings\\" of \\"Hesperus\\" and \\"Phosphorus\\" are already known. This problem led Frege to distinguish between the sense and reference of a word. Some cases seem to be too complicated to be classified within this framework; the acceptance of the notion of secondary reference may be necessary to fill the gap. See also Opaque context. =Linguistic sign= The very concept of the linguistic sign is the combination of content and expression, the former of which may refer entities in the world or refer more abstract concepts, e.g. thought. Certain parts of speech exist only to express reference, namely anaphora such as pronouns. The subset of reflexives expresses co-reference of two participants in a sentence. These could be the agent (actor) and patient (acted on), as in \\"The man washed himself\\", the theme and recipient, as in \\"I showed Mary to herself\\", or various other possible combinations. Computer science In computer science, references are data types that refer to an object elsewhere in memory and are used to construct a wide variety of data structures, such as linked lists. Generally, a reference is a value that enables a program to directly access the particular data item. Most programming languages support some form of reference. For the specific type of reference used in the C++ language, see reference (C++). The notion of reference is also important in relational database theory; see referential integrity. Library and information sciences References to many types of printed matter may come in an electronic or machine-readable form. For books, there exists the ISBN and for journal articles, the Digital object identifier (DOI) is gaining relevance. Information on the Internet may be referred to by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). Psychology In terms of mental processing, a self-reference is used in psychology to establish identification with a mental state during self-analysis. This seeks to allow the individual to develop own frames of reference in a greater state of immediate awareness. However, it can also lead to circular reasoning, preventing evolution of thought. According to Perceptual Control Theory (PCT), a reference condition is the state toward which a control system's output tends to alter a controlled quantity. The main proposition is that \\"All behavior is oriented all of the time around the control of certain quantities with respect to specific reference conditions.\\" Scholarship In academics and scholarship, a reference or bibliographical reference is a piece of information provided in a footnote or bibliography of a written work such as a book, article, essay, report, oration or any other text type, specifying the written work of another person used in the creation of that text. A bibliographical reference mostly includes the full name of the author, the title of their work and the year of publication. The primary purpose of references is to allow readers to examine the sources of a text, either for validity or to learn more about the subject. Such items are often listed at the end of a work in a section marked References or Bibliography. References are particularly important as for the use of citations, since copying of material by another author without proper reference and / or without required permissions is considered plagiarism, and may be tantamount to copyright infringement, which can be subject to legal proceedings. A reference section contains only those works indeed cited in the main text of a work. In contrast, a bibliographical section often contains works not cited by the author, but used as background reading or listed as potentially useful to the reader. Keeping a diary allows an individual to use references for personal organization, whether or not anyone else understands the systems of reference used. However, scholars have studied methods of reference because of their key role in communication and co-operation between different people, and also because of misunderstandings that can arise. Modern academic study of bibliographical references has been developing since the 19th century. Law In patent law, a reference is a document that can be used to show the state of knowledge at a given time and that therefore may make a claimed invention obvious or anticipated. Examples of references are patents of any country, magazine articles, Ph.D. theses that are indexed and thus accessible to those interested in finding information about the subject matter, and to some extent Internet material that is similarly accessible. Arts In art, a reference is an item from which a work is based. This may include: * an existing artwork * a reproduction (i.e., a photo) * a directly observed object (e.g., a person) * the artist's memory Another example of reference is samples of various musical works being incorporated into a new one.

The tank had a weight of 36.5 tons and was powered by a 630 hp diesel engine, which gave it a top road speed of . The primary armament of the Panzer 61 was a 105 mm main gun.  History and development  During the early 1950s the Swiss Army tried to buy modern tanks to reinforce the armoured forces which, due to the war in Korea, proved to be impossible. As a stop-gap solution, the Swiss army purchased AMX-13 light tanks from France and decided to develop a domestic medium tank. The first prototype and production vehicles were designated Panzer 58. The first Panzer 58 prototype was armed with a domestic 90mm rifled gun, the second Panzer 58 was fitted with a British 84 mm calibre Ordnance QF 20 pounder. and the third prototype as well as the production model was fitted with a Royal Ordnance L7 105mm rifled gun. The Panzer 58 served similarly to a preproduction model of the improved Panzer 61, and in 1961 the Swiss parliament approved production of 150 Panzer 61s. The vehicles were delivered between 1965 and 1967, produced at the Eidgenoessische Konstruktionswerkstaette (today RUAG Land Systems) facility at Thun.http://www.janes.com/extracts/extract/jaa/jaa_0067.html From 1967 to 1994 (when the last Panzer 61 battalion was re-equipped with more modern tanks) Panzer 61 vehicles were upgraded and retrofitted with technology found on the more advanced Panzer 68 (its successor). Among other improvements, the Panzer 61's original coaxial 20 mm autocannon was replaced by a coaxial 7.5 mm machine gun in the Panzer 61 AA9 variant.

Midget (from midge, a sand fly) is a term for a person of unusually short stature that is considered by some to be pejorative. While not a medical term, it has been applied to persons of unusually short stature, often with the medical condition dwarfism, particularly proportionate dwarfism. It may also refer to anything of much smaller than normal size, as a synonym for \\"miniature\\", such as a midget cell, a midget crabapple, a midget submarine, MG's Midget, Daihatsu's Midget, and the Midget Mustang airplane; or to anything that regularly uses anything that is smaller than normal (other than a person), such as midget car racing and quarter midget racing; or a smaller version of play or participation, such as midget golf; or to anything designed for very young (i.e., small) participants‚Äîin many cases children‚Äîsuch as Disneyland's Midget Autopia, Midget hockey, and Midget football. History Charles Sherwood Stratton as \\"General Tom Thumb\\", circa 1861 Merriam-Webster dictionary states that the first use of the term \\"midget\\" was in 1816.Merriam-Webster Dictionary Entry for midget: sometimes offensive: a very small person; specifically: a person of unusually small size who is physically well-proportioned. Midgets have always been popular entertainers, but were often regarded with disgust and revulsion in society. In the early 19th century, however, midgets were romanticized by the middle class and regarded with the same affectionate condescension extended to children, as creatures of innocence. The term \\"midget\\" came into prominence in the mid-19th century after Harriet Beecher Stowe used it in her novels Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands and Old Town Folks where she described children and an extremely short man, respectively. P. T. Barnum indirectly helped popularize the term \\"midget\\" when he began featuring General Tom Thumb, Lavinia Warren and Commodore Nutt in his circus. \\"Midget\\" became linked to referencing short people put on public display for curiosity and sport. Barnum's midgets, however, were elevated to a position of high society, given fantasy military titles, introduced to dignitaries and royalty, and showered with gifts.Charles Sherwood Stratton (AKA General Tom Thumb) and His Circle, Jack & Beverly's Images of Special Subjects, December 2005.Exhibit: \\"Sketch Of The Life, Personal Appearance, Character And Manners Of Charles S.

Such performances continued to be widespread through the mid part of the twentieth century, with Hermines Midgets brought from their performances in Paris to appear at the 1939 New York World's Fair, the same year that MGM released The Wizard of Oz, which featured 124 midgets in its cast, most of whom were from the Singer's Midgets troupe.GoogleBooks Image for The Making of the Wizard of Oz Page 193 When interviewed for a 1999 piece, performers engaged in ongoing \\"Midget Wrestling\\" events stated that they did not view the term \\"Midget Wrestling\\" as derogatory, but merely descriptive of their small size; however, others responding to the piece disagreed, with one stating that the performances themselves perpetuated an outdated and demeaning image. Towards the end of the twentieth century, the word became considered by some as a pejorative term when in reference to people with dwarfism. One notable exception, though, was accomplished actor Herv√© Villechaize who preferred the term \\"midget\\". There have been movements to remove use of the word \\"midget\\" from age classification categories in youth sports, with Hockey Canada announcing that it would refer to the division as \\"U18\\" in 2020, as part of a wider renaming scheme.

The name stood for _e_ xtended (or _e_ nhanced) _d_ isk _o_ perating _s_ ystem. In 1970, IBM announced the IBM/370 product line along with new peripherals, software products, and operating systems, including DOS/VS that supplanted DOS. Although IBM was rightly focused on their new products, the computing world was dominated by the IBM/360 line, which left a lot of users nervous about their investment. Although there were a couple of projects emulating the IBM/370 on the IBM/360 (e.g., CFS, Inc.), a couple of companies took a different approach, extending the then-current (and limited) DOS. The Computer Software Company (TCSC) took the latter approach. Starting in 1972, they developed Edos, Extended Disk Operating System. They extended the number of fixed program space partitions from 3 to 6, added support for new hardware, and included features that IBM had offered separately. The first version of Edos was released in 1972, in response to the announcement by IBM that DOS Release 26 was the last DOS release to be supported on the System 360, and future DOS Releases would support System 370 machines only. They also made available other third party enhancements such as a spooler and DOCS, from CFS, Inc.  Edos/VS and Edos/VSE  TCSC enhanced EDOS to become EDOS/VS, which was announced in 1977 and delivered it to beta test sites in 1978. In May 1977, TCSC announced it would release Edos/VS in response to IBM's release of DOS/VS Release 34 and Advanced Functions-DOS/VS. Edos/VS was based on IBM's DOS/VS Release 34, and provided equivalent functionality to IBM's Advanced Functions-DOS/VS product. Unlike IBM's offerings, Edos/VS would run on System 360 machines and System 370 machines lacking virtual storage hardware (non-VS machines), whereas IBM's offerings only supported the latest System 370 models with VS hardware included. TCSC identified the parts of IBM's DOS/VS Release 34 operating system which relied upon System/370-only machine instructions and rewrote them to use instructions supported by the System/360. TCSC was legally able to reuse IBM's DOS/VS Release 34 code, since IBM had (intentionally) published the code without a copyright notice, which made it public domain under US copyright law at the time. In 1981, NCSC announced plans to release an Edos/VSE 2.0, based on IBM DOS/VSE Release 35, suitable for IBM 4300 machines.  TCSC corporate history  TCSC was founded by Jerry Enfield and Tom Steel, responsible for development and marketing, respectively. Company headquarters were in Richmond, Virginia. TCSC expanded into Canada, Australia, and Europe.article In 1980, the company was acquired by Nixdorf and became NCSC. Other products of TCSC included the Extended Console (Econ) system, which enabled display of the system console using a CRT terminal such as an IBM 3270. Econ was available for IBM's DOS and DOS/VS and TCSC's Edos and Edos/VS operating systems. TCSC licensed DATACOM/DB from Applied Data Research (ADR) to run under its EDos and EDos/VS operating systems. When in 1980 Nixdorf bought TCSC, Nixdorf sought to continue the licensing arrangement; ADR and NCSC went to court in a dispute over whether the licensing arrangement was terminated by the acquisition. ADR and Nixdorf settled out of court in 1981, with an agreement that Nixdorf could continue to resell ADR's products.  Add-on products for Edos  In 1973, TCSC released a remote job entry (RJE) option for Edos. In 1975, TCSC released a tape management system for Edos known as TMS. In 1983, NCSC announced a Unix compatibility subsystem for IBM mainframes running IBM's DOS/VS(E) and Nixdorf's Edos/VS and Edos/VSE operating systems, known as Programmer Work Station/VSE-Advanced Functions, or PWS/VSE-AF for short. PWS/VSE-AF was based on the Coherent Unix clone developed by Mark Williams Company.

History  The word arse in English derives from the Proto-Germanic (reconstructed) word *arsaz, from the Proto-Indo-European word *ors-, meaning \\"buttocks\\" or \\"backside\\". The combined form arsehole is first attested from 1500 in its literal use to refer to the anus. The metaphorical use of the word to refer to the worst place in a region (e.g., \\"the arsehole of the world\\"), is first attested in print in 1865; the use to refer to a contemptible person is first attested in 1933. In the ninth chapter of his 1945 autobiography, Black Boy, Richard Wright quotes a snippet of verse that uses the term: \\"All these white folks dressed so fine / Their ass-holes smell just like mine ...\\". Its earliest known usage in newspaper as an insult was 1965. As with other vulgarities, these uses of the word may have been common in oral speech for some time before their first appearances in print. By the 1970s, Hustler magazine featured people they did not like as \\"Asshole of the Month.\\" In 1972, Jonathan Richman of Modern Lovers recorded his song \\"Pablo Picasso\\", which includes the line \\"Pablo Picasso was never called an asshole.\\" Until the early 1990s, the word was considered one of a number of words that could not be uttered on commercial television in the United States. Comedian Andrew Dice Clay caused a major shock when he uttered the word during a televised MTV awards show in 1989. However, there were PG-13 and R rated films in the 1980s that featured use of the word, such as the R-rated The Terminator (1984), the PG-13-rated National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (1989), and the PG-rated Back to the Future (1985). By 1994, however, vulgarity had become more acceptable, and the word was featured in dialog on the long-running television series NYPD Blue, though it has yet to become anything close to commonplace on network TV. In some broadcast edits (such as the syndication airings of South Park), the word is partially bleeped out, as \\"assh‚Äî\\".  Semantics  The word is mainly used as a vulgarity, generally to describe people who are viewed as stupid, incompetent, unpleasant, or detestable. Moral philosopher Aaron James, in his 2012 book, Assholes: A Theory, gives a more precise meaning of the word, particularly to its connotation in the United States: A person, who is almost always male, who considers himself of much greater moral or social importance than everyone else; who allows himself to enjoy special advantages and does so systematically; who does this out of an entrenched sense of entitlement; and who is immunized by his sense of entitlement against the complaints of other people. He feels he is not to be questioned, and he is the one who is chiefly wronged. This word or its literal translation is found in colloquial speech in a number of cultures besides English because it describes both an intimate part as well as an organ for defecation, both of which are considered to be taboo parts of the body in many societies. The English word ass (meaning donkey, a cognate of its zoological name Equus asinus) may also be used as a term of contempt, referring to a silly or stupid person. In the United States (and, to a lesser extent, Canada), the words arse and ass have become synonymous.  Political usage  In 2000, during a Labor Day event, then-candidate George W. Bush made an offhand remark to his running mate, Dick Cheney, that The New York Times reporter Adam Clymer was a \\"major league asshole.\\" The gaffe was caught on microphone and led to a political advertisement chiding Bush for \\"using expletives... in front of a crowd of families,\\" produced for Democratic opponent Al Gore. In February 2004, American media reported that during a rally of supporters, Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez was reported to have called Bush \\"an asshole\\" for believing his aides in supporting a coup against Chavez in 2002. The word in its original Spanish was \\"pendejo\\", and in news coverage the word was widely (though incorrectly) translated as \\"asshole\\"; the true meaning of the word varies substantially within Latin America, and in Venezuela its meaning is closer to \\"fool\\". In September of the following year, Nightline host Ted Koppel said to Chavez on national television, \\"I'm going to perhaps shock you a little, but these are your words. You called President Bush an asshole,\\"‚Äîto which Chavez replied, \\"I've said various things about him. I don't know if I actually used that word.\\" In 2008, the Liberal Democrat MP for Leeds North West, Greg Mulholland was recorded describing health minister Ivan Lewis as an arsehole after Lewis refused to let him intervene in a Westminster Hall debate on hospice funding. He later publicly defended his comment.

The objective of CBBC is to assist UK organisations to do business in China, to work with Chinese companies in the UK and to support UK-China partnerships in third markets. It works in close collaboration with the Department for International Trade (DIT), for whom it delivers China business development services. CBBC also cooperates closely with the private sector and trade associations, the British Embassy and Consulates in China; the British Chambers of Commerce in China, and the Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) in the UK and the Devolved Administrations, as well as local chambers and other relevant organisations across the UK. In addition, CBBC organises missions to the Chinese market; identifies business opportunities; and provides research as well as a range of other practical services for UK companies in the market. CBBC also hosts inward delegations from China, arranges events in the UK and China, and hosts business events for all senior Chinese leaders visiting the UK. CBBC has a staff based in 11 regions in the UK and 13 cities in China. The main China office is in Beijing, while the other offices are located in Shanghai, Shenzhen, Wuhan, Chengdu, Qingdao, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'An and Changsha. CBBC also provides an in-house research service that is specifically tailored to the needs of each company. All research is carried out by CBBC's project managers across the China offices. CBBC has conducted such research projects in a wide range of sectors, including both product and service industries.http://www.cbbc.org  History  The organisation's history dates back to the early 1950s when British companies were among the first to trade with Communist China. That was the 48 Group of Companies (established in April 1954). At the same time, the British government had a semi-official trade body known as the Sino-British Trade Council which promoted British participation in trade fairs and exhibitions in China. Although the UK was the first Western country to recognize the People's Republic of China, the PRC did not fully recognize the UK until 1972 (see Sino-British relations). The China‚ÄìBritain Trade Group was established in 1991 when the 48 Group merged with Sino-British Trade Council, at the instigation of the (then) UK Department of Trade and Industry. After the first six months, CBTG had a membership of 100 British companies, large and small, paying an annual subscription. Members were able to attend exclusive meetings with Chinese visitors, attend specialist workshops, and had priority access to special events. A big incentive of membership for many was the provision of services by the CBTG's two China offices. As the number of offices grew, CBTG continued to offer this service to members, and it is still a benefit of membership today. The early 1990s saw a renewal of high-level visits from China to the UK In November 1992 vice-premier Zhu Rongji was the first Chinese leader to take part in a seminar with British business in the UK, when the Stock Exchange was the venue for presentations from privatised industries, organised by CBTG and the Stock Exchange. The biggest events of the mid-1990s were the huge business groups taken to China by Michael Heseltine, as trade minister in 1995, then as deputy prime minister in 1996. CBTG was involved in putting together the business groups which accompanied the deputy prime minister. In 1996 a decision was made to allow member companies to appoint representatives in China and rent space in CBTG offices, which would provide services to them. Visiting CBTG Beijing that year, Michael Heseltine coined a name for this service: the China Launchpad. This has since become a popular service which the China‚ÄìBritain Business Council still offer UK companies. The return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty in 1997 led to warmer relations with the UK. Less than a month after his appointment as premier in 1998, Zhu Rongji was back in the UK, where a CBTG dinner in London's Guildhall attracted 900 guests. That year, the organisation changed its name to the China‚ÄìBritain Business Council (CBBC), to reflect the growth of all round business between the UK and China encompassing investment, trade, licensing and other forms of business activity. In November 1999, the UK received the first head of state from the People's Republic of China, Jiang Zemin, who was greeted by a CBBC organised business lunch at the Banqueting House. In the UK, CBBC's promotion of opportunities in China has never stopped. In its first year, there began a long tradition of organising a nationwide programme of seminars and conferences. Since then there has been a continuous programme of conferences and seminars with VIP speakers, briefings around the country for groups of exporters, and meetings with Chinese industrial and provincial leaders. Lord Powell, a former foreign affairs adviser to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, took over the presidency of CBBC in 1998. His first task was to accompany Prime Minister Tony Blair to China with a business delegation. The following year saw visits to the UK by then Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao, and President Jiang Zemin. CCPIT chairman Wan Jifei followed in 2001, and in October that year, the then Vice-President Hu Jintao also came to the UK. Sir David Brewer, Former Lord Mayor of the City or London, became CBBC Chairman in 2007, and continued to push forward CBBC's contribution to UK-China trade and business exchange, and he has now, through his career, made well over 100 trips to China. In 2013, Lord James Sassoon was announced as the new CBBC Chairman. This was also the year that CBBC celebrated the 60th anniversary of its founding. China-Britain business relations have become strong in recent years with the support of CBBC. In 2014, Chinese premier Li Keqiang visited the UK with Lord Sassoon jointly hosting a state dinner on honour of Mr Li, attended by 650 British and Chinese political and business dignitaries. In 2015, Lord Sassoon as Chairman of CBBC hosted the UK-China Business Summit during President XI Jinping's visit to the UK.  Objectives  The objectives of CBBC are: * Overall to maximise Britain's trade with China; * To encourage British firms and organisations with appropriate capabilities to enter the China market; * To help British companies identify profitable business opportunities in China; * To support the activities of British companies in China; * To provide particular assistance and encouragement to SMEs.

The pumpkin is a symbol of harvest time, and pumpkin pie is generally eaten during the fall and early winter. In the United States and Canada, it is usually prepared for Thanksgiving,Rombauer, I. S and M.R. Becker. 1980. The Joy of Cooking. Bobs-Merrill Company, New York City. and other occasions when pumpkin is in season. The pie filling ranges in color from orange to brown and is baked in a single pie shell, rarely with a top crust. The pie is generally flavored with cinnamon, powdered ginger, nutmeg, and cloves. Allspice is also commonly used and can replace the clove and nutmeg, as its flavor is similar to both combined. Cardamom and vanilla are also sometimes used as batter spices. The spice mixture is called pumpkin pie spice. The pie is often made from canned pumpkin or packaged pumpkin pie filling (spices included), mainly from varieties of Cucurbita moschata. Preparation Pumpkin pie filling being made Pies made from pumpkins use pie pumpkins which measure about in diameter. They are considerably smaller than jack o'lanterns. The first step for getting the edible part out of the pumpkin is to slice it in half and remove the seeds. The two halves are heated until soft, in an oven, over an open fire, on a stove top, or in a microwave oven. Sometimes the pumpkin halves are brined to soften the pulp instead of being cooked. At this point, the pulp is scooped out and pur√©ed. The pulp is mixed with eggs, evaporated and/or sweetened condensed milk, sugar, and a spice mixture called pumpkin pie spice, which includes nutmeg and other spices (e.g., ginger, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, mace), then baked in a pie shell. Similar pies are made with butternut squash or sweet potato fillings. History Homemade pumpkin pie in Thanksgiving The pumpkin is native to the continent of North America. The pumpkin was an early export to France; from there it was introduced to Tudor England, and the flesh of the \\"pompion\\" was quickly accepted as pie filler. During the seventeenth century, pumpkin pie recipes could be found in English cookbooks, such as Hannah Woolley's The Gentlewoman's Companion (1675).Andrew F. Smith, \\"Pumpkins\\", The Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America. Ed. Gordon Campbell. Oxford University Press, 2003. Saint Mary's College of California. 21 December 2011.Woolley, Hannah, The Gentlewoman's Companion ..., 3rd ed. (London, England: Edward Thomas, 1682), \\"Pumpion pye\\", pp. 220‚Äì221. Pumpkin \\"pies\\" made by early American colonists were more likely to be a savory soup made and served in a pumpkin than a sweet custard in a crust. It was not until the early nineteenth century that the recipes appeared in Canadian and American cookbooks or pumpkin pie became a common addition to the Thanksgiving dinner. The Pilgrims brought the pumpkin pie back to New England, while the English method of cooking the pumpkin took a different course. In the 19th century, the English pumpkin pie was prepared by stuffing the pumpkin with apples, spices, and sugar and then baking it whole. In the United States after the Civil War, the pumpkin pie was resisted in southern states as a symbol of Yankee culture imposed on the south, where there was no tradition of eating pumpkin pie. Many southern cooks instead made sweet potato pie, or added bourbon and pecans to give a southern touch. Today, throughout much of Canada and the United States, it is traditional to serve pumpkin pie after Thanksgiving dinner. Additionally, many modern companies produce seasonal pumpkin pie-flavored products such as candy, cheesecake, coffee, ice cream, french toast, waffles and pancakes, and many breweries produce a seasonal pumpkin ale or beer; these are generally not flavored with pumpkins, but rather pumpkin pie spices. Commercially made pumpkin pie mix is made from Cucurbita pepo, Cucurbita maxima, and Cucurbita moschata. (Libbey Select uses the Select Dickinson Pumpkin variety of C. moschata for its canned pumpkins.) Pumpkin pies were briefly discouraged from Thanksgiving dinners in 1947 as part of a rationing campaign, mainly because of the eggs in the recipe. In popular culture A slice of home-made pumpkin pie =Poetry= *Lydia Maria Child's Thanksgiving poem \\"Over the River and Through the Wood\\" (1844) references pumpkin pie in one of its verses: \\"Hurrah for the fun! Is the pudding done? / Hurrah for the pumpkin pie!\\" *John Greenleaf Whittier wrote in his poem \\"The Pumpkin\\" (1850): A can of pureed pumpkin, typically used as the main ingredient in the pie filling =Songs= *Oscar Ferdinand Telgmann and George Frederick Cameron wrote the song \\"Farewell O Fragrant Pumpkin Pie\\" in the opera Leo, the Royal Cadet (1889): *The Christmas-themed song \\"There's No Place Like Home for the Holidays\\" makes a reference to homemade pumpkin pie being looked forward to by a man returning to his family's home in Pennsylvania. * \\"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree\\" contains the lyric, \\"Later we'll have some pumpkin pie/And we'll do some caroling\\". *\\"Sleigh Ride\\", another popular Christmas song, also mentions sitting around a fire after being out in the snow and eating pumpkin pie.

The other three children and the master were led away and killed.Carleton Cole, Destination: Asia, Bangkok Books, 2008, p. 117. . \\"When they brought in another old master for more lessons,\\" Chorn-Pond recalled, \\"I begged them not to kill him. I told them I didn‚Äôt have enough skills yet, and I offered them my own life instead.\\"Arn Chorn-Pond, \\"Lost Music,\\" p. 65. On a visit to Cambodia in 1996, he was reunited with his teacher.Catherine Foster \\"'Where Elephants Weep': A Cambodian opera for modern times,\\" New York Times, Thursday, April 26, 2007. In a 2002 interview Chorn-Pond described how his survival depended on repressing his emotions and distancing himself from the horror of his situation: : \\"I was in a temple where they killed three or four times a day. They told us to watch and not to show any emotion at all. They would kill us if we reacted...if we cried, or showed that we cared about the victims. They would kill you right away. So I had to shut it all off...I can shut off everything in my body, practically, physically. I saw them killing people right in front of me, the blood was there, but I didn't smell it. I made myself numb...The killing was unbearable. You go crazy if you smell the blood.\\"Simms, Laura and Arn Chorn-Pond, \\"Between Tigers and Crocodiles: An Interview with Arn chorn-Pond,\\" Parabola: Myth, tradition and the Search for Meaning, 2002, 27:4, p. 28. When the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in 1978, Chorn-Pond was handed a gun and forced to fight: : \\"The Khmer Rouge gave us guns and pushed us into the front line. Children who refused were shot in the head. Many of us ranged from eight [and] up, so long as we could carry guns. I was then about twelve. The Khmer Rouge would shoot us from behind if, against orders, we tried to leave the battleground. Thousands of children got shot to the left and right of me, many of them good friends.\\"Arn Chorn-Pond, \\"Arn Chorn-Pond,\\" in Frederick Franck, Janis Roze, Richard Connolly (eds.) What Does It Mean to Be Human?: Reverence for Life Reaffirmed by Responses from Around the World, Macmillan, 2001 , p. 196. : \\"Many kids got killed because the Vietnamese are very good. Most of the Vietnamese soldiers had experience with Americans, and we didn't know that...And I became good friends with some of the kids, and on the battlefields sometimes they got shot in the left and the right from me, in the stomach and the head. Many times I held them, blood all over me. The worst feeling I had was that you can‚Äôt help them at all...I saw kids and adults got hit in the head, by the bullets, crawling. So I don't believe in crawling anymore. I just stood up and shoot like hell...I fought about two or three months. The thing that I couldn't take is to watch my friends dying every day. That's the worst feeling.\\"\\"Becoming a Child Soldier in Cambodia, Part 2,\\" video clip produced by Media Entertainment, Inc., for the 2000 documentary The Genocide Factor.

From its inception in 1984 though 1988, Children of War trained a core leadership group of 150 young people representing twenty-one countries. More than 100,000 U.S. students from 480 schools participated in the program.\\"Biography: Arn Chorn- Pond In 1992 Chorn-Pond received a bachelor's degree in political science from Providence College Chinoy, Ira, \\"Surgeon General to Address Providence College Graduates,\\" Providence Journal, May 14, 1992, p.

Chorn-Pond was also one of the few surviving Cambodians to return to the refugee camps on the Thai-Cambodian border. While attending college in Rhode Island, Arn devoted his summers from 1986 through 1988 to teaching and assisting those still displaced by war. He was also the youngest Cambodian involved in diplomatic efforts for reconciliation. While a student at Providence College, Chorn-Pond co-founded the Southeast Asian Big Brother/Big Sister Association in Providence and founded Peace Makers, a US-based gang intervention program for Southeast Asian youths in Providence.Biographies of Providence College's 2007 Honorary Degree Recipients In 1993 he returned to Cambodia and founded the Cambodian Volunteers for Community Development.Jodi F. Solomon Speakers Bureau, \\"Arn Chorn-Pond\\". In 1998 he founded the Cambodian Master Performers Program, which grew into Cambodian Living Arts. The organization's original mission was to revive the endangered traditional performing arts in Cambodia by locating former masters or trained professional musicians and helping them to pass on their skills and knowledge to the next generation. Cambodian Living Arts has since expanded its scope of programming to include scholarships, fellowships, workshops, training, commissions, arts education, and a cultural enterprise that provides enriching job opportunities to Cambodian performing artists. Chorn-Pond remains engaged with the organization's work, both as spokesperson and in particular with the work of The Khmer Magic Music Bus, a program of Cambodian Living Arts that takes music performances and demonstrations to villages and communities around Cambodia which would otherwise lack access to performing arts, and also works closely with certain communities to keep some especially rare forms of Cambodian music alive. Arn Chorn-Pond has also served as Director of Youth Programs for the Cambodian Mutual Assistance Association in Lowell, Massachusetts, and since 2001 has been a special adviser on Cambodian affairs for Clear Path International.

During his chancellorship, he tried to reform the taxation system, but his reforms were opposed by Han Huang and soon reversed.  Background  Cui Zao was born in 737, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His family was from \\"the second house of Boling\\" of the prominent Cui clan of Boling. Cui's immediate male ancestors ‚Äî great-grandfather Cui Shaorui (Â¥îÁ¥πÁùø), grandfather Cui Ding (Â¥îÈ†Ç), and father Cui Shengzhi (Â¥îÊòá‰πã) ‚Äî however, did not reach offices any higher than county magistrate or sheriff positions. Cui Zao had at least two brothers, an elder brother named Cui Lin (Â¥îÈÅ¥), who served as a county secretary general, and a younger brother named Cui Shu (Â¥îËø∞), who served as a prefectural prefect.New Book of Tang, vol. 72. When Cui Zao was young, he was said to be studious. During the Yongtai era (765-766) of Emperor Xuanzong's grandson Emperor Daizong, Cui lived at Shangyuan (‰∏äÂÖÉ, in modern Nanjing, Jiangsu), and he had three close friends, Han Hui (ÈüìÊúÉ), Lu Dongmei (ÁõßÊù±Áæé), and Zhang Zhengze (ÂºµÊ≠£Ââá). The four all were not native to Shangyuan, and they often met to discuss their views on economics. They also all had ambitions to serve the emperor, and the people at the time referred to them as the Four Kui. He was later invited by Li Qiyun (ÊùéÊ†ñÁ≠†) the governor of Zhexi Circuit (ÊµôË•ø, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) to serve on Li's staff.As Li Qiyun was governor of Zhexi Circuit from 768 to 771, Cui's service under him must have during that time. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 11 . Cui later served as Zuosi Yuanwailang (Â∑¶Âè∏Âì°Â§ñÈÉé), a low-level official under one of the Secretaries General of the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). While serving thus, he became friendly with the senior official Liu Yan.Old Book of Tang, vol. 130 .  During Emperor Dezong's reign  In 780, during the reign of Emperor Daizong's son Emperor Dezong, Liu Yan was demoted and then killed after false accusations by Yang Yan and Yu Zhun (Â∫æÊ∫ñ). Cui Zao, as an associate of Liu's, was demoted to be the secretary general of Xin Prefecture (‰ø°Â∑û, in modern Shangrao, Jiangxi). As of 783, when Emperor Dezong was forced to flee from the capital Chang'an to Fengtian (Â•âÂ§©, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), due to a rebellion led by Zhu Ci, Cui was serving as the prefect of Jian Prefecture (Âª∫Â∑û, in modern Nanping, Fujian). He sent a declaration to the nearby prefectures, asking them to raise troops together to aid the emperor. He then himself took 2,000 troops from his prefecture and headed toward Fengtian. Emperor Dezong heard this and praised him. After Tang forces recaptured Chang'an in 784, he summoned Cui to Chang'an, but Cui, because his uncle Yuan Xiu (Ê∫ê‰ºë) had been a major contributor to Zhu's rebellion and had been executed, did not dare to head to Chang'an immediately; instead, he submitted a petition asking for punishment. Emperor Dezong, believing that he was acting appropriately, issued an edict praising and consoling him, and he made Cui Libu Langzhong (ÂêèÈÉ®ÈÉé‰∏≠), a mid-level official at the ministry of the civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®, L√¨bu), as well as imperial attendant (Áµ¶‰∫ã‰∏≠, Jishizhong). In 786, Emperor Dezong, believing Cui to be brave and capable, gave Cui the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã), making him a chancellor de facto, along with Liu Zi and Qi Ying. As Emperor Dezong favored Cui's talent, both Liu and Qi yielded most of the responsibilities to Cui. Cui, during the time that he was living in the Yangtze River region, had long despised the institution of having various special directors for financial matters, believing the officials given those positions to be generally corrupt, so he advocated abolishing the director positions in charge of tax collection and transportation of food supplies. He advocated, and Emperor Dezong agreed, to have the tax collection responsibilities given to the local governors and prefects, and that the remaining financial responsibilities be returned to the executive bureau of government (Â∞öÊõ∏ÁúÅ, Shangshu Sheng). Further, the chancellors were put in charge of the six ministries of the executive bureau directly ‚Äî with Cui himself in charge of the ministries of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®, Hubu) and public works (Â∑•ÈÉ®, Gongbu); Qi in charge of the ministry of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®, Bingbu); Liu in charge of the ministries of civil service affairs and rites (Á¶ÆÈÉ®, L«êbu, note different tone than the ministry of civil service affairs); and Li Mian in charge of the ministry of justice (ÂàëÈÉ®, Xingbu). Further, under Cui's recommendation, his friend Yuan Xiu (ÂÖÉÁêá, note different characters than Cui's uncle) was put in charge of the salt, iron, and wine monopolies, while Ji Zhongfu (Âêâ‰∏≠Â≠ö) was put in charge of the collected taxes.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232. Han Huang, the military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhenhai Circuit (ÈéÆÊµ∑, headquartered in modern Zhenjiang), on whom the imperial government relied on for food supplies at the time since there was a major famine in the Chang'an region, however, opposed these changes. To placate Han, Emperor Dezong did not abolish the office of director of Yangtze-Huai River transportation and gave that office to Han as well. Yuan requested that the responsibilities be divided ‚Äî that Han be in charge of the transportation south of the Yangtze, and Yuan be in charge of the transportation north of the Yangtze. Han was not pleased, however, and submitted petitions attacking Yuan's handling of the monopolies. Emperor Dezong thus removed Yuan from his financial responsibilities and made him a secretary general of the executive bureau. When a large amount of food shipment arrived from Zhenhai to Chang'an in fall 786, Emperor Dezong was very pleased with Han and gave him the additional offices as directors of the monopolies and taxes. Further, it was popular opinion at the time that while Cui's idea to return to earlier Tang regulations might have been a good one in peace, given the desperate state the empire was in at the time after years of warfare, the director positions needed to be maintained. In addition, with Yuan no longer overseeing the monopolies, Cui himself was unable to figure out financial matters and became so distressed that he fell ill. Around new year 787, with Han advocating and Emperor Dezong agreeing that the various changes that Yuan and Cui instituted needed to be reversed, Emperor Dezong removed Cui from his chancellor post and made him a member of the staff of his crown prince Li Song. Cui died in fall 787.  Notes and references  * Old Book of Tang, vol. 130. * New Book of Tang, vol. 150. * Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 232.

It is a sequel to Dead Rising, and is the second entry in the series of the same name. The game features a number of new features and improvements to its predecessor, including multiplayer options. The game's story see players controlling Chuck Greene, a former motocross rider, who finds himself at the centre of another zombie outbreak taking place in a casino resort and shopping complex in Nevada, and becomes involved in uncovering the truth behind it. Not only must he survive against the zombies roaming the complex by scavenging weapons and supplies, along with rescuing survivors caught up in the incident and dealing with crazed psychopaths, Chuck must also ensure that his young daughter receives regular treatments of a medication that prevent her from becoming a zombie herself, after being bitten by her mother during a previous outbreak in Las Vegas. Like the previous game, players must complete major missions to advance the story, but can undertake optional tasks and explore the complex, with various endings available depending on actions taken during the main game. The game's success led to it receiving two downloadable episodes - one being a prologue to the main story, the other taking place moments after achieving its canonical ending - along with a remake entitled Dead Rising 2: Off the Record, while, as part of Dead Risings ten year anniversary, a ported version of the game was released in September 2016 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Gameplay The player controls protagonist Chuck Greene as he fights off hordes of zombies while accomplishing specific missions. The game includes several new objects that can be used to attack the zombies. Up to 7,000 zombies can be seen onscreen at the same time. Dead Rising 2 allows players to manufacture their own custom weapons at various points in the game by collecting items and combining them together in maintenance rooms scattered across the game map. The player also has the ability to unlock \\"combo cards\\" that reveal weapons that can be combined together. Such combinations include the \\"Hail Mary\\", a hand grenade duct taped to a football, \\"Dynameat\\", a stick of dynamite duct taped to a piece of meat, the \\"Paddlesaw\\", two chainsaws duct taped to a kayak paddle, and \\"Spiked Bat\\" which is a baseball bat with nails hammered through the item. Like the first game, boss fights are represented by 'psychopaths', people who have either been driven insane by the zombie outbreak or are taking advantage of it to fulfill their cruel desires. =Multiplayer= During the 2009 Tokyo Game Show, Capcom revealed that the multiplayer of Dead Rising 2 takes the form of the in-game reality TV show \\"Terror Is Reality\\" in which players will act as contestants in a fictional gameshow. Four players participate in multiplayer, competing against each other for the most kills inside an arena full of undead. Players can use weapons and vehicles including human-sized hamster balls and chainsaw-equipped motorcycles. They also will be able to prevent other players from scoring by using various forms of \\"dirty\\" tactics. Chuck Greene joins the reality pay-per-view gameshow \\"Terror is Reality\\" to get money for his daughter's Zombrex. (Zombrex being a medicine which prevents infected humans from turning into zombies as long as it is taken once daily.) Terror is Reality (TiR) is hosted by Tyrone King (TK). Players compete with players all over the world online, and earn money for their character at the same time. The show consists of three minigames, including \\"Zomboni\\" (driving a car that makes zombie juice and players have to shoot the juice to the target to get points), \\"Bounty Hunter\\" (players snipe zombies and they can earn extra points by hitting the jackpot), \\"Stand Up Zomedy\\" (players put flowers, sticks, and dresses on the zombie, earn more points by getting all three of items in one zombie), and so on. Finally, the major game in TIR is \\"Slicecycle\\", where players drive motorcycles to slice up zombies for points. The winners and participants get money for their participation points from the games. It was confirmed during Captivate '10 that cooperative gameplay for the story campaign will be available and according to Blue Castle Games there will be an online co-op mode. Both players will play as the main character, Chuck Greene, and will be able to earn experience and keep the items they collected throughout the game‚Äîbut only the host player will be able to save the game's progress. A host can invite a friend to join the current game by sending out an invitation; if the friend accepts, a confirmation icon will be displayed and the host can allow the player to join in. Non-host players can drop in/out of a co-op game anytime they like. When the players become separated, a tiny animated Chuck Greene icon will appear at the bottom of the game screen. The icon will show what the other player is up to‚Äîattacking, being assaulted by zombies, etc. If a player is taken down by zombies, he will be able to call the other for help to revive them. The player will use food to revive the dying partner before his health runs out. Plot In 2011, five years after the events of Dead Rising, former motocross champion Chuck Greene is in the fictional casino town of Fortune City, Nevada, to take part in Terror is Reality, a controversial sports entertainment game show where contestants kill zombies for money and fame. Chuck needs the prize money to buy Zombrex (a daily medication that suppresses the zombification process) for his daughter Katey, who was bitten by her zombified mother during a previous outbreak in Las Vegas when she was only 4 years old. While Chuck is backstage after the show, the show's supply of zombies is released; Chuck rescues Katey and makes his way to an emergency shelter, which is sealed after their arrival. Raymond Sullivan (the only security guard to reach the shelter alive) is initially reluctant to let the infected Katey in, but Chuck promises to keep her supplied with Zombrex until the military arrives in three days. Chuck needs to venture into the post apocalyptic city to find a dose of Zombrex, entering and exiting the shelter via an air duct. Another survivor, Stacey Forsythe (leader of the Nevada branch of zombie rights organization \\"Citizens for Undead Rights and Equality\\", which was in town to protest the treatment of the zombies by Terror is Reality) supplies him with a map and two-way radio; she promises to keep watch on the shelter's security monitors and direct Chuck to any other survivors or points of interest in the area. After returning with the first dose of Zombrex for Katey, a news report implicates Chuck as the cause of the Fortune City outbreak. Chuck tracks down the reporter, Rebecca Chang, at a nearby hotel, and offers her the story of a lifetime if she gives him a chance to prove his innocence and helps him determine who was really behind the outbreak. Following this, Chuck has three main objectives to complete: discover the origin of the Fortune City outbreak by following the \\"Case File\\" missions, rescue as many survivors as possible (either from zombies, or from the \\"psychopath\\" boss characters), and find enough doses of Zombrex to keep Katey alive until the military arrives. Chuck and Rebecca discover that Terror is Reality host Tyrone \\"TK\\" King is using the outbreak as cover to rob Fortune City's four main casinos. Chuck foils the robberies and prevents the host from escaping in his helicopter. TK is locked up in the shelter, and reveals that another organization responsible for the outbreak paid him to frame Chuck for it. Three days after the outbreak, the military arrives, but a green gas begins emanating from underground and causes zombies to mutate into a more powerful form. The convoy is unprepared to deal with the super-zombies, and is wiped out almost completely. A second military force would normally arrive 24 hours later, but media reports claim that the first convoy reached the shelter and found no survivors, so the city will be cleansed by firebombing at that time. The safe house is also sabotaged, and Chuck must quickly repair the door before too many zombies enter. Regardless of the player's actions, TK is bitten, and needs Zombrex to survive. Rebecca reveals the cause of the gas seems to be in the underground access tunnels, and Chuck finds a hidden facility where pharmaceutical company Phenotrans, the makers of Zombrex, is harvesting the zombies. The drug is manufactured from the queens of the genetically modified wasps that create zombies; the gas released by the Phenotrans facility is intended to increase the number of queens in a zombie horde. After killing the scientists in charge of the harvesting, Chuck recovers a satellite phone and a laptop from the facility and takes them to Rebecca as proof that Phenotrans orchestrated the outbreak in order to harvest more queens, while driving up demand for Zombrex. Just as Rebecca attempts to contact her news station and report the discovery, Sullivan shoots her dead. Sullivan is revealed as a Phenotrans operative; he was the one who let the Terror is Reality zombies out while framing Chuck, and the one who sabotaged the shelter. He escapes with the phone and laptop, and Chuck follows him to a casino rooftop, where he plans to escape by skyhook after revealing that the Vegas and Fortune City outbreaks were necessary to keep a consistent supply of queens to make Zombrex, enraging Chuck as his wife was killed in the Vegas outbreak which led to Katey getting infected in the first place. After a fierce battle, Chuck handcuffs Sullivan's harness to the rooftop, ripping him in half when the recovery aircraft catches the skyhook. Chuck contacts Rebecca's channel and offers to give them proof of Phenotrans' involvement in the Fortune City outbreak if they send helicopters to rescue the survivors. = Endings = Like the predecessor, the player can encounter different endings depend on their action in the game. Two of the ending listed below are canon to the series : * Ending S (Complete all Case Files, give Katey all of the required Zombrex doses, and give TK a dose of Zombrex) *: Chuck calls off the bombing. He arrives back at the shelter to find the civilians being evacuated, but Stacey and Katey are not among them. He searches the control room and finds Katey's backpack. The game then goes into \\"Overtime Mode\\". Chuck receives a radio transmission from TK, who has kidnapped Stacey and Katey; he tells Chuck to collect several items from around Fortune City and bring them to the Terror Is Reality arena by noon (10 hours away). Chuck does so, but is tasered on arrival by TK and wakes up suspended over a pit of zombies, alongside Katey and Stacey. Chuck frees himself and climbs up to the rafters, where he fights TK. After overpowering TK and throwing him to the zombies, Chuck frees the other two, and they leave the city hand-in-hand. A zombie then screams into the camera, giving the players one last scare. *: This ending was the original canon ending of the game before the release of Dead Rising 2: Case West, although in E3 2013, the developers confirmed this ending as canon, so it is possible that TK zombifies after the fall, and the rest plays out like Ending A, thus making this ending possibly canon with Case West. * Ending A (Complete all Case Files, give Katey all of the required Zombrex doses, but don't give TK a dose of Zombrex) *: The station sends a convoy of news helicopters to evacuate the shelter, one of which collects Chuck from the hotel roof and drops him at the shelter. Stacey brings a sleeping Katey to the helicopter, but Katey's bag, containing her mother's possessions, is accidentally dropped by the elevator. Chuck goes to grab it, but is ambushed by the zombiefied TK and several other zombies. He throws the bag to Stacey, and tells her to take care of Katey as he is dragged into the elevator. The epilogue states the city is bombed, but Chuck is cleared of his accused involvement in the outbreak and is praised as a hero. However, Phenotrans shares rise in price, and Chuck's fate is unknown. This ending is a canon ending to Dead Rising 2: Case West in the intro where Frank West finds Chuck almost being bitten by the zombie TK and rescues him. Other endings are: * Ending B (Run out of time during The Facts) *: Unable to deal with the outbreak, the U.S. government orders the bombing of Fortune City, wiping out all zombies and survivors. * Ending C (Be in the Safe House when the military arrives during Case 6-1: Help Arrives) *: Chuck, Katey and Stacey wait for the rescue, when they hear gunshots. Chuck sees the attacker before he is shot dead himself. The military rescue was a failure and no one was rescued. * Ending D (Be anywhere but the Safe House when the military arrives during Case 6-1: Help Arrives) *: Chuck wakes up in a military truck, with soldiers who believe he was the responsible for the outbreak. Suddenly the truck stops and gunshots are heard. The green gas envelops them and the scene fades to black. The military rescue was a failure and no one was rescued. * Ending F (Do not give Katey all of the required Zombrex doses) *: After Katey's demise, Chuck is in the Safe House holding her backpack. Stacey tells him not to blame himself when zombies get in. Chuck lets himself be eaten alive by the zombies, while Stacey watches in horror. The military rescue was a failure and no one was rescued. * Alternate Overtime Ending (Fail to collect all TK items in time) *: TK declares that Chuck \\"had other things to do\\" and lowers the rope Katey and Stacey are tied to into the zombies, allowing them to be eaten alive. Although technically an ending, receiving this conclusion will lead to a game over. Development and release Dead Rising 2 was announced on February 9, 2009, confirming earlier rumors of the game's existence, as well as a viral video for the game. The developers Blue Castle Games worked with Keiji Inafune, the original Dead Rising producer and Capcom's former global head of research and development, along with other original Dead Rising team members. =Promotion= Promotion at E3 2010 Capcom created a variety of websites before the release of the game.

Downloadable content =Case Zero= Dead Rising 2: Case Zero is the prequel for Dead Rising 2, and is set shortly after Chuck and Katey escape from the Las Vegas zombie outbreak. The player must deal with a minor outbreak in the town of Still Creek, and move on before the military arrives and kills any infected (including non-zombies like Katey). The player can reach up to level five in Case Zero, with the level and any combo cards earned able to be transferred into the main game. Case Zero was released on August 31, 2010 in North America and Europe for Xbox, then in Japan at a later date because the Computer Entertainment Rating Organization was concerned about the content and the download's rating. The game is region- locked to these specific areas, and cannot be downloaded outside these regions. In the game's first week of release, 300,000 downloads were made: the fastest selling game on Xbox Live Arcade. On September 15, Capcom announced that Case Zero had received more than 500,000 downloads. Reception for Case Zero has been generally favorable, receiving an average score of 79 on Metacritic. IGN gave the title a 6.5 out of 10 rating, criticizing the load times and the lack of things to do. GameSpot gave the title an 8 out of 10 rating, praising the fun zombie killing, in-depth weapon creation, and multiple endings that require several playthroughs. Joystiq gave the title a 4 out of 5 star rating, and recommended the game to anyone because of both the content and the price. Eurogamer gave the title a 7 out of 10 rating, criticizing many annoyances but praising the overall product. =Case West= On September 15, 2010, Capcom announced a second downloadable episode: Case West. The Xbox 360 exclusive is available on the Xbox Live Marketplace. The game features Frank West, the main character from the first Dead Rising game, and serves as the canon Overtime Mode of Dead Rising 2, with Frank teaming up with Chuck to further investigate the link between Phenotrans and the Fortune City zombie outbreak, and find proof that clears Chuck of any wrongdoing. The story follows on from Ending A of the main game, with Frank rescuing Chuck from the elevator. Frank was going to meet Rebecca Chang to investigate a Phenotrans facility west of Fortune City, but learns from Chuck that she was killed by Phenotrans mole Sullivan. Although initially suspicious of Chuck because of the media reports blaming him for the Fortune City outbreak, Frank lets the motocross star come with him to find proof that Phenotrans was behind the outbreak. Case West includes cooperative play for two players, with each taking control of one of the two characters. The episode features new challenges, enemies, items, and combo weapons. The photography element returns from the first Dead Rising; the characters use this to generate proof of Phenotrans' part in the zombie outbreaks. Case West was released on December 27, 2010 for Xbox in North America. Case West received generally positive reviews, with a score of 74 on Metacritic. IGN gave the title an 8.5 out of 10 rating, with praise for the story, combo weapons, and fun co-op mode. Eurogamer gave the title an 8 out of 10 rating, stating that the product was more a worthwhile purchase for people planning to play co-op with a friend. GameTrailers awarded the title with a 7.9 out of 10 rating, saying that the $10 asking price was worth it. GameSpot gave the title a 7 out of 10 rating, praising the new weapons, fun while rescuing survivors, wacky humor, and plenty of replay value, but criticizing the similarity it has to Case Zero, the lack of integration with previous games, and that the photography in the game has less impact than in Dead Rising. = Endings (Case West) = * Ending A (Complete all cases and Defeat Harjit) Harjit loses his balance and falls into a Tube of Queens and tries to get up but is stung to death by queens, Chuck and Frank confront Marian and they learn about a cure Isabella created, in an attempt to kill them Marian activates Self-Destruct to the Phenotrans Facility and leaves and takes unconscious Isabella with her as Chuck tries to convince Frank to stay and find the cure. Frank convinces Chuck that its too late and they need to go now. Chuck follows him out of the Building and both Chuck and Frank watch the Facility's destruction and Chuck is depressed about knowing there was a cure and the difference that would have made to the whole world, Frank tells Chuck it might have been a lie and he says he needs to believe that there's a cure out there but at least they got the evidence that Phenotrans was responsible for the Fortune City Outbreak and says nobody is gonna take their word for what was going on in that place, as they continue watching the Facility's destruction Frank's watch beeps and he realizes that he left his Zombrex in the Directors office earlier as he looks like he is about to accept his fate, Chuck gives him the same zombrex he threw away earlier and Tells him \\"Take it, The world needs Frank West\\" and they take one last looks at the Facility's Destruction. This ending is Canon to Dead Rising 3. * Alternate Ending (Fail to complete all cases in time) Chuck and Frank get captured by soldiers. This ending will result in an alternate game over screen saying \\"The Truth has Vanished\\". Remake At Captivate 2011, Capcom's annual press show, the company announced that it was releasing Dead Rising 2: Off the Record, as a reinterpretation of the game with Frank West from the original Dead Rising as the main character. The game was released for the same consoles on October 11 in North America, October 13 in Japan, and October 14 in Europe for a discount retail price. Off the Record is intended as a complete reimagining of Dead Rising 2, with new missions, cutscenes, environments, enemies, and weapons. The photography mechanic from the first Dead Rising is also included. There are technical and system upgrades, such as optimization of loading times and improved network performance. Off the Record also features a new sandbox mode. This allows players to explore Fortune City without the obstacle of time. Off The Record has received mostly positive reviews, with the changes and additions both praised and panned. On September 13, 2016, Capcom re-released the game alongside Dead Rising and Dead Rising 2: Off the Record on Xbox One, PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows to coincide with the tenth anniversary of the game. Reception Dead Rising 2 received \\"generally positive\\" reviews, according to review aggregator Metacritic. GameZone gave the Xbox 360 version of the game a 6 out of 10, stating, \\"the lackluster presentation, uninspired story, outright broken multiplayer, and atrocious amount of glitches makes Dead Rising 2 less of a flawed gem and more of a somewhat polished pile that incrementally smells worse the longer you let it sit in your disc drive.\\" Game Informer gave the game a 9.5 out of 10, stating, \\"Even after playing for dozens of hours, you'll still find new things in Dead Rising 2. I won't spoil anything, but there's a lot of variety to be found in the game beyond obvious things like the number of objects that can be used as bludgeons. This game is designed for multiple playthroughs, and I'm looking forward to each and every one of them.\\" Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw listed Dead Rising 2 in second place in his Top 5 games of 2010, praising it for its correcting all of Dead Risings issues such as high difficulty and poor AI and for the Combo Weapons mechanic. In February 2011, Capcom announced that the title had sold more than 2.2 million copies worldwide.

He is the author of The Future of Us: What the Dreams of Children Mean for 21st Century America (Columbia 2017) and the author of Americans at Risk: Why We Are Not Prepared for Megadisasters and What We Can Do Now (Knopf, 2006).. Redlener is president emeritus and co- founder (with singer songwriter Paul Simon and Karen Redlener) of Children's Health Fund (CHF), director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at The Earth Institute - Columbia University. and Professor of Health Policy & Management and Professor of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center. Redlener is a special advisor to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, with a focus on emergency management and planning to support and advise the administration's citywide disaster preparedness and response efforts. Background Redlener was born in Brooklyn, New York. He received his B.A. from Hofstra University in 1964 and his M.D. from the University of Miami in 1969. In 1971, while a pediatric resident at University of Colorado Medical Center, Redlener left his program to serve as the medical director of VISTA health center in Lee County, Ark, the 6th poorest county in the U.S. During this time, he met his future wife, Karen, a VISTA volunteer who organized the region's first social services and child development program. The two have worked together since.  Career  Redlener served as the director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital. He also worked on disaster relief efforts in Honduras, Guatemala, and created a new Child Action Center to study and treat child abuse. In 1979, after a brief stint in neonatal intensive care at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, he briefly worked as a community pediatrician in Utica, New York. He also served as chairman of the national executive committee of Physicians for Social Responsibility, a public health organization promoting prevention of nuclear war. In 1985, Redlener joined the board of USA for Africa as the organization's medical director and director of grants, where he met legendary songwriter/singer Paul Simon. In 1987, Redlener, Paul Simon and Karen Redlener founded Children's Health Fund to provide health care to homeless and medically underserved children in New York City. The program began with a single mobile medical unit funded by Simon and designed by Redlener's wife, Karen. More than 25 years later, the organization has 23 programs with more than 50 mobile medical units in underserved rural and urban communities throughout the United States. Karen Redlener remains with the Fund, currently serving as the organization's chief administrative officer. Redlener also served as head of outpatient pediatrics at Cornell/New York Hospital (1987‚Äì1990) and head of community pediatrics at Montefiore Medical Center (1990‚Äì2003). Redlener designed and oversaw development of the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center and served as its president 2001-2003.

In 1993-1994, he was part of the White House Task Force on National Health Care Reform, serving as the vice-chairman of its Health Professional Review Group. He was also a founding member of the Task Force on Terrorism of the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2001. In April 2000, Redlener was engaged by INS Commissioner, Doris Meissner, to provide strategic guidance regarding the management of the Elian Gonzalez case. He claimed in a letter to INS that based on weeks of studying the case including a \\"propaganda 40-second video of 7-year-old Elian,\\" he ‚Äúis now in a state of imminent danger to his physical and emotional well-being in a home that I consider to be psychologically abusive.‚Äù He urged that the government immediately remove the \\"horrendously exploited‚Äù Elian from the ‚Äúbizarre and destructive ambiance‚Äù of his Miami relatives and returned to his biological father. Eleven Cuban American doctors dismissed Redlener's opinion for not ‚Äúhaving obtained a medical history, performed a physical examination or other proper psychological evaluations of Elian.\\" Redlener strongly refuted the premise of these assertions and suggested that his critics had no understanding of how to diagnose psychological child abuse. Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson unaware that pediatricians were the most common medical specialists who diagnose and report child abuse, said Dr. Redlener was \\"neither a psychiatrist nor a psychologist and who has never examined the young Cuban refugee.\\" Elian Gonzalez was returned to Cuba two months later, where he had permanent bodyguards assigned to him since the age of seven, enrolled in military school and in 2013 declared: \\"‚ÄúFidel Castro is like a father to me. I don‚Äôt profess to have any religion, but, if I did, my god would be Fidel Castro.\\" In 2003, Redlener was recruited to the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University to establish the National Center for Disaster Preparedness. Since 2003, Redlener has served as director of NCDP, working to improve public policy and resources, as well as citizens‚Äô individual preparedness.

In 2010, in part due to his research on the health effects of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Oil Drilling appointed Redlener to serve as the Commission's Special Consultant on Public Health. On November 15, 2012, following Superstorm Sandy, New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that he had appointed Redlener co-chair of the NYS Ready Commission, which was tasked with finding ways to ensure critical systems and services are prepared for future natural disasters and other emergencies. On June 17, 2014, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio named Redlener special advisor with a focus on emergency management and planning to support and advise the administration's citywide disaster preparedness and response efforts. In 2018, Redlener became president emeritus of CHF transitioning leadership to CEO Dennis Walto. After severe criticism of the Trump Administration policies with respect to treatment of children on the U.S. Southwest border, including op-eds in the Washington Post, The Hill, and other publications, Redlener was asked by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to help devise protocols to improve medical care and custodial conditions for children in federal custody.

He went by the alias Tammy Beauchamp during much of his football career. Playing career A Collingwood junior, Beacham spent his entire career as a centreman. He debuted with Fitzroy late in 1899 and played the final two home and away matches but, despite being noted as \\"quick and smart\\", was omitted for the sectional matches and the grand final. Over the following four seasons Beacham became a useful member of a successful Fitzroy side. As regular finalists they were upset in the 1900 grand final and knocked out in the semi and final matches in 1901 and 1902 respectively. During this period Beacham represented the VFL against South Australia in both 1901 and 1902. Often noted for his pace and creativity he provided drive into the forward line for the likes of Percy Trotter and Gerald Brosnan. The 1903 grand final proved another disappointment. With seconds remaining Fitzroy had drawn within three points of Collingwood. From the centre Beacham passed to Trotter who then hit the reliable Brosnan in range. The shot was just off-line and the siren rang leaving Collingwood premiers by two points. In October 1903 Beacham moved to Adelaide and here the spelling of his surname first appears as Beauchamp. He originally resided in Sturt tying him residentially to that football club. Just prior to the season he moved to East Torrens with a view to playing for Norwood. A permit was granted but subsequently rescinded on an appeal from Sturt thus delaying Beacham's Norwood debut by a month. Once able to take the field he was appointed vice-captain and played effectively until a knee injury late in the season kept him out for some weeks. Selected under a fitness cloud for the final against Souths he lasted only until quarter-time before having to leave the game when his knee gave way. Sportingly Souths allowed a substitute and Norwood managed a three-point win. Returning to Melbourne in 1905 he rejoined Fitzroy, who were now defending premiers, and had the only premiership success of his senior career. As they had been through the season, Beacham, Barclay Bailes and Trotter were the driving forces in the grand final.Browne. p.91. The media universally rated Bailes as best afield followed by Beacham who was opposed to Jock McHale on the day.Browne. p.97. This was an opinion shared by captain Brosnan who told noted, \\"we beat them chiefly across the centre where young Bailes and Beauchamp (sic) were very fine in their work\\". At the club's annual meeting the following March Beacham was also named by his team mates as one of the sides most consistent players for the year. Beacham played well in the 1906 VFL Grand Final loss to Carlton and maintained reasonable form over the next two seasons but Fitzroy's form declined and they missed the finals in 1907 and 1908. Beacham played his last VFL match in the 1908 final round win over Melbourne. In 1996 Beacham was one of ten nominations for a position on the centreline in Fitzroy's Team of the Century but was not selected in the final team. Umpiring career Following his playing career Beacham successfully applied for a position as a VFL field umpire. He was appointed to VFL senior football immediately the season began and officiated at the Essendon versus St.Kilda in the opening round. He was awarded Heritage Number 44. The following week he was appointed as a boundary umpire for Melbourne versus Essendon earning Heritage Number 49 for that discipline. Over the course of 1909 he was appointed to 8 VFL matches - 7 field, 1 boundary. When not umpiring in the VFL he was regularly appointed to country competitions including the mid-week Goulburn Valley league. He finished the season with the first semi-final of the Goulburn Valley Football Association. From 1910‚Äì1912 Beacham was appointed to four VFL matches on the boundary and only officiated as a field umpire in the country. He umpired grand finals in the Peninsula Football Association (1911) and Bright District (1911). Beacham retired at the end of the 1913 season having umpired 12 VFL and 78 country matches.Flegg, David. Records. Accessed 30 November 2013. Microsoft Access database. Umpires' association Beacham was elected to the executive committee of the VFL Umpires' Association in 1913.

Origin and development Before the English Restoration a Chief Engineer was a pay grade and not defined. In 1660 King Charles II appointed Sir Charles Lloyd, who had served in the English Civil War, as head of a new department of engineers. The position was confirmed in a Royal Warrant (26 May 1716), which also authorised the formation of the Corps of Engineers.Whitworth, p. 93 When in 1802, Sir William Green, 1st Baronet retired, the office was abolished and Robert Morse became the newly created Inspector-General of Fortifications and of Royal Engineers (IGF). Until 1855 the Inspector-General was attached to the Board of Ordnance and then was subordinate directly to the Commander-in-Chief. In 1862 the office was extended to Inspector-General of Engineers and Director of Work, keeping the affiliation in the former function while being now responsible to the Secretary of State for War in the latter. On the resignation of Edward Frome in 1869, both offices were separated for one year. The Director of Works was dropped in 1895 and the office was renamed to Inspector-General of Fortifications. It was again abolished in 1904 and replaced by the Director of Fortifications and Works. Modern times In 1936 the post of Chief Royal Engineer was recreated and Sir Bindon Blood was appointed by King George V. Sir Bindon was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1860 and had a distinguished active career until he retired in 1907 aged 65. He was thus 94 years old when appointed Chief Royal Engineer. He resigned in 1940 and died a month later aged 97. From 1941 until 2012 the professional head of the Corps was the Engineer-in-Chief (Army) (EinC(A)) who as 'Director of Royal Engineers', acted as the engineer advisor to the Chief of the General Staff (CGS) as well as to the Royal Navy, the Royal Air Force and other government ministries on matters of military engineering on behalf of the CGS. This post was disestablished following the Strategic Defence and Security Review and responsibility for the EinC‚Äôs duties split between the Commandant Royal School of Military Engineering (heritage and training), Commander 8 Engineer Brigade (force generation matters) and the Corps Colonel RE (manning matters and first point of contact with external agencies). The Chief Royal Engineer is head of the Corps of Royal Engineers and invariably a distinguished officer of the Corps; his tenure in the post is normally for a period of five years. He is responsible for seeing that the Corps' traditions and customs are preserved and the continuity of important matters of Corps policy. He keeps the Colonel- in-Chief (Since 1952 Queen Elizabeth II) informed on Corps matters and maintains contact with engineer units in the Commonwealth. He will have previously served as a Colonel Commandant and will continue to fill one of the vacancies.

She left the faculty in 1949 to establish her own studio in New York in the same year.Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting Britannica.com. Combining what she had learned from the Yiddish theatre, the Group Theatre, Broadway, Hollywood, and Constantin Stanislavski, Stella created the Stella Adler Theatre Studio, later renamed the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting and more recently the Stella Adler Studio of Acting, where she taught acting for many decades,Stella Adler, 91, an Actress And Teacher of the Method New York Times, December 22, 1992. and in 1985, she opened the Stella Adler Academy and Theatre in Los Angeles.Adler Stella Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary Completing the Twentieth Century, by Susan Ware, Stacy Lorraine Braukman, Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. Harvard University Press, 2004. . Page 9-10 The studio offered courses in principles of acting, voice and speech, Shakespeare, movement, and makeup, as well as workshops in play analysis, character, scene preparation, and acting styles. Onstage experience was acquired by performances of scenes and plays before an invited audience. Among her early students were Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, Warren Beatty, Elaine Stritch, Mario Van Peebles, Harvey Keitel, and Candice Bergen. Adler's grandson Tom Oppenheim, who runs the Stella Adler Studio of Acting in New York and the Art of Acting Studio in Los Angeles, summarizes her approach to acting as such: \\"Growth as an actor and growth as a human being are synonymous.\\" =Establishment in New York= Stella Adler (1901‚Äì1992), founder of the school The Stella Adler Studio of Acting, in New York City, was founded in 1949 by Adler. In 1969, it became the first professional training school to become affiliated with New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. The studio became a 501(c)3 not-for- profit organization in 2000. The mission of the Stella Adler Studio of Acting is to create an environment with the purpose of nurturing theatre artists who value humanity, their own and others, as their first and most precious priority while providing art and education to the greater community. The Stella Adler Studio of Acting New York City's official West Coast branch is the Art of Acting Studio Los Angeles, named after Stella Adler's most famous book. The Stella Adler Studio of Acting is not affiliated with the Stella Adler Academy in Los Angeles. =Los Angeles studio= Adler's long history with Hollywood meant she had close ties and strong connections in the Los Angeles area. She taught for many years at various locations in Los Angeles, and longtime friend and prot√©g√© Joanne Linville and she eventually opened the doors to the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Argyle. Some of the notable people who have passed through the Hollywood conservatory include Nick Nolte, Salma Hayek, Eric Stoltz, Deidre Hall, Sean Astin, John Charles Jopson, John Ritter, Herschel Savage, Cybill Shepherd, Michael Richards, Benicio del Toro, and Mark Ruffalo. Prot√©g√©s Joanne Linville and Irene Gilbert persuaded Stella Adler to open the academy in 1985 in Los Angeles. Together, Gilbert and Linville are considered the school's cofounders, with Adler granting them permission to use her name. Gilbert remained the director of the school for 20 years. The original school was located in a small theater at Hollywood Boulevard and Argyle Avenue. A fire forced the temporary closure of the school in 1991. The building was threatened with demolition to make way for a proposed subway line at the time of Adler's death in 1992. In 1994, Irene Gilbert reopened the school's present location at 6773 Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. It was renamed the Stella Adler Academy of Acting, and celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2010. The historic location housed the famous Embassy Club in the 1930s. The school is an acting studio offering extensive training for actors in theatre, film, and television. The facility houses the not-for-profit Stella Adler Theatre, the Irene Gilbert Theatre, The Studio C Theatre, classrooms, dance studio, music studio, library, dressing rooms, video and equipment room, scene shop, and administrative offices, all dedicated to teaching Stella's technique. Linville continues to teach at the academy as the lead instructor for the last 25 years. Irene Gilbert died in 2011.

Entolimod is a recombinant protein that acts as an agonist of toll-like receptor 5 (TLR5), an innate immunity receptor. Entolimod activation of TLR5 triggers NF-Œ∫B signaling, mobilizing an innate immune response that drives expression of numerous genes, including inhibitors of apoptosis, scavengers of reactive oxygen species, and a spectrum of protective or regenerative cytokines.  Radiation countermeasure  The FDA established the animal efficacy rule in 2002 to permit the approval of certain drugs and biologics that are intended to reduce or prevent serious or life-threatening conditions based on evidence of safety from trial in healthy subjects and effectiveness from appropriate animal studies when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. Efficacy of entolimod as a radiation countermeasure has been assessed in animal models. These studies demonstrate that a single administration of entolimod given either before or after lethal total body irradiation leads to significant improvement in animal survival. Entolimod has been shown to reduce radiation damage to both hematopoietic (HP) and gastrointestinal (GI) tissues and improve tissue regeneration. Two clinical studies that involved administration of a range of doses of entolimod in 150 healthy human subjects have been completed. Both studies demonstrated that administration of entolimod appears to be safe within a certain dose range. The most frequent adverse event associated with entolimod administration was a transient flu- like syndrome, which is consistent with the mechanism of action of the compound. The FDA granted entolimod both Fast Track and Orphan Drug status for reducing the risk of death following a potentially lethal dose of total body irradiation during or after a radiation disaster. Both the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense procure and maintain medical stockpiles to respond to bioterrorist and emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Under a declared state of emergency, countermeasures may be procured for the Strategic National Stockpile under an Emergency Use Authorization prior to their full FDA licensure approval. Oncology Preclinical studies have shown that entolimod has a suppressive effect on growth of TLR5 expressing tumors. Entolimod has also been shown to have an effect on several animal models of liver metastasis, regardless of TLR5 expression. Additionally, entolimod evidences a supportive care benefit in preclinical models when combined with radiation treatment and cytotoxic agents with adverse gastrointestinal (GI) effects. Tissue protective effects of TLR5 agonists are limited to normal tissues and do not involve protection of tumors from treatment. A Phase I advanced solid tumor study is currently ongoing at Roswell Park Cancer Institute. The Principal Investigator for this trial is Alex Adjei, M.D., Ph.D., FACP, Chair of the Department of Medicine and Senior Vice President of Clinical Research at Roswell Park Cancer Institute. Additionally, entolimod may also be developed as an adjuvant to standard radiation and chemotherapy, which will allow using of more aggressive measures to attack malignant cells and increase the effectiveness of cancer treatment.

It begins by running east for 130 km to the city of Upington. After its intersection with the R360 (which provides a shorter and faster route south into Upington Central), the N10 continues eastwards up to the Upington Airport entrance (a t-junction), where it turns south and enters the Upington City Centre to meet the R360 again. At the Short Street junction, the N10 meets the N14 and they are concurrent on Short Street south-eastwards. At the junction with Scott Street, the N14 turns eastwards while the N10 turns southwards to cross the Orange River. From Upington, the N10 follows the Orange River for 114 km eastwards, through Grootdrink (where it turns to the south-east), to the town of Groblershoop, where it meets the western end of the N8 National Route from Kimberley. From the N8 junction, the N10 continues following the Orange River south-east for 133 km, through Marydale, to the town of Prieska.

It was the second American aircraft to feature cabin pressurization. It was initially described as a 'supercharged cabin' by the Army. The distinction of the world's first pressurized aircraft goes to a heavily modified Engineering Division USD-9A which flew in the United States in 1921. The XC-35 was a development of the Lockheed Model 10 Electra that was designed to meet a 1935 request by the United States Army Air Corps for an aircraft with a pressurized cabin.Lockheed XC-35 Electra, Smithsonian Institution National Air and Space Museum. Design and development The United States Air Corps wanted the aircraft to perform high altitude research and to test the feasibility of a pressurized cabin. The Corps contracted with Lockheed Aircraft Corporation to produce the aircraft at a total cost of $112,197. The requirements called for an aircraft capable of flying at no less than 25,000 ft (7,620 m) and having an endurance of ten hours with at least two hours above 25,000 ft (7,620 m). Major Carl Greene and John Younger, both structures experts who worked for the Air Corps Engineering Division at Wright Field in Ohio were responsible for the design of the pressurized cabin structure. Greene and Younger worked with Lockheed to modify a Model 10 Electra with a new fuselage consisting of a circular cross-section that was able to withstand up to a 10 psi differential.Lockheed XC-35 , National Museum of the Air Force. New, smaller windows were used to prevent a possible blowout while operating at high pressure differentials. The cabin pressurization was provided by bleeding air from the engines' turbo supercharger, the compressor outlet fed into the cabin and was controlled by the flight engineer.Airplanes that Transformed Aviation, Air & Space Magazine. This system was able to maintain a cabin altitude of 12,000 ft (3,658 m) while flying at 30,000 ft (9,144 m).Van Patten, Robert E. Air Force Magazine Online, Vol.86, No.1 January 2003 The fuselage was divided into two compartments, a forward pressurized compartment, and an aft unpressurized compartment. The forward compartment housed two pilots, a flight engineer, and up to two passengers. The aft compartment provided accommodation for one passenger and could be used only at low altitudes since it lacked pressurization. The XC-35 was fitted with two Pratt & Whitney XR-1340-43 engines of 550 hp (410 kW) each compared to the two Pratt & Whitney R-985-13 of 450 hp (336 kW) fitted to the base Model 10 Electra. The engines featured a turbo supercharger to permit the engines to operate in thin air at high altitudes. Operational history The XC-35 in flight The XC-35 was delivered to Wright Field, Ohio in May 1937, made its first performance flight on August 5, and was involved in an extensive flight testing program for which the Army Air Corp was awarded the Collier Trophy. The lessons learned from the XC-35 played a key role in the development of the Boeing 307 Stratoliner and the B-29 Superfortress which was to be the first mass-produced pressurized aircraft. The Air Corps brass were so confident in the new technology that they allowed the XC-35 to be used as an executive transport for Louis Johnson, the Assistant Secretary of War and future Secretary of Defense. In 1943, NACA pilot Herbert H. Hoover flew the XC-35 into thunderstorms to gather data on the effects of severe weather on aircraft in flight.Herbert H.

Braham emigrated from England to America as a child. As a teenager, he toured as a violinist. After this he became a conductor and music director at New York and Boston theatres. In 1879, he conducted the first American production of a Savoy opera, H.M.S. Pinafore and became associated with Gilbert and Sullivan works for the next decade. He also conducted a number of other musical theatre works and at music halls. In 1913 and 1914, he composed musical scores for silent films, including In the Land of the Head Hunters. Biography =Early years and Gilbert and Sullivan= Braham was born in 1847 in England to musician Joseph Braham (1827‚Äì1877). The Brahams emigrated from England in the 1850s.Various sources give dates between 1849 and 1859. His brothers were William, Albert and Harry, and his uncle (not his brother) was David Braham, composer for Harrigan & Hart.\\"John J. Braham Dies; Composer of Music\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, October 28, 1919Franceschina, John. Dave Braham: the American Offenbach, Routledge, 2003. In 1862, at the age of 14, Braham began earning his living as a violinist in New York vaudeville and music hall houses and theaters.In the 1860 Federal Census of New York he is listed as a musician, 14 years of age. His father served as the music director for Tony Pastor's Opera House on the Bowery, where Braham may have played in the orchestra. After touring for a few years as a violin virtuoso, Braham accepted the post of musical director of Pike's Opera House and subsequently at other New York theatres. During the 1870s he worked as a musical director and conductor in Boston, Massachusetts (Adelphi Theatre, Howard Athenaeum, Boston Museum Orchestra), as well as at surrounding summer resorts. He composed popular songs in many genres, the earliest known copyright in 1871. In the 1870s, he also began to compose scores for the musical stage. For example, in 1876, The Era reported that his comic opera Evangeline pleased Boston audiences with its catchy melodies.\\"The Drama in Boston\\", The Era, July 30, 1876, p. 11 Braham introduced America to the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. He conducted the first performances of H.M.S.

Pinafore and the Theater Season in Boston, 1878‚Äì1879\\", Journal of Popular Culture, 24 (Spring 1991): 119‚Äì127 From 1882 to 1883, he directed an authorized production of Iolanthe at the newly opened Bijou Theatre in Boston with a cast that featured principals from the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. Other Gilbert and Sullivan productions included D'Oyly Carte tours in New England of The Mikado and Ruddigore in 1885‚Äì86 and 1887. He also conducted a revival of Patience in Boston, again with several members of the D'Oyly Carte company in the principal cast and the first Boston productions of The Yeomen of the Guard (in 1889), and The Gondoliers (in 1890). In 1894, directed D'Oyly Carte's original American productions of Utopia, Limited in New York and then Boston. For his American productions of the Savoy operas, Braham made \\"judicious changes\\" in the scores. =New York and later years= By the 1880s, Braham began dividing his time between Boston and New York City, first at Wallack's Theatre and, in the middle of the decade, became music director of the Casino Theatre at Broadway and 39th Street. He married Sophia Broschart in Boston in 1891, and the couple's children were John J. Braham Jr. and Marjorie Sophia Braham. He is listed in 1899 in The New York Times as director at Koster and Bial's Music Hall but was also engaged on occasion at the Casino Theatre's roof top garden.

Curtis commissioned Braham to compose a score for In the Land of the Head Hunters. This 1914 film fictionalized the world of the Kwakwaka'wakw (Kwakiutl) peoples of the Queen Charlotte Strait region of the Central Coast of British Columbia, Canada, and was written and directed by Curtis and acted entirely by Kwakwaka'wakw natives. Braham's score was performed with full orchestra, at the premiere of In the Land of the Head Hunters, at the Casino Theatre in New York, probably its only performance. Braham died in Brooklyn, New York, on October 28, 1919 at the age of 72.

Its first recorded owner was Ulschalcus von Rabensberg, of the knights of Rabensberg (), first mentioned in 1214. The castle was abandoned in the 13th century, when the owners relocated to Krumperk Castle, and it was in ruins by the 17th century. The estate was inherited by the Hohenwarths, followed by the sisters of St. Clare from Mekinje. In the second half of the 19th century, the castle became known as Old Castle () or Freight Castle (), named after the nearby freight route from the Central Sava Valley. In 1930, the land surrounding the ruins was purchased by Senator Valentin Ro≈æiƒç.

It operates T-1 Jayhawk aircraft conducting flight training. The squadron is one of the oldest in the Air Force, being formed during World War I as the 48th Aero Squadron on 4 August 1917. Currently the squadron specializes in the tanker and airlift track of specialized undergraduate pilot training. Students receive at least 159 hours of flight instruction in the Raytheon T-1 Jayhawk where they learn air refueling procedures, tactical navigation, airdrop, and advanced navigation. Upon completion of this phase, students earn the aeronautical rating of pilot and receive their Air Force wings. History =World War I= The squadron's origins date to 4 August 1917 with the formation of the 48th Aero Squadron at Kelly Field, Texas. It was organized into the first Aero construction squadron designated for deployment to the American Expeditionary Forces in France. After basic training at Kelly Field, the squadron was sent to the Aviation Concentration Center, Garden City, New York in mid-September 1917 for subsequent movement to France. It embarked on the Cunard Liner SS Pannonia, suffering a stormy and unpleasant voyage across the Atlantic. It arrived at Liverpool, England on 29 October. After a few days in England, the squadron arrived at Rest Camp No. 2, Le Havre, France on 1 November.Gorrell Formation of the 462d Aero Squadron, probably taken in Germany during the summer of 1919 just prior to its demobilization The first meaningful work of the squadron was at the Third Aviation Instruction Center, Issoudun Aerodrome in Central France. It arrived on 3 November to help construct barracks and shops from lumber. It also erected hangars and did the necessary construction work to bring the airfield into an operational school for training pursuit (fighter) pilots. It also began work on six airfields to support the training school, building roads, putting up hangars, and installing water and electrical systems. A detachment of the squadron was sent to the Second Aviation Instruction Center, Tours Aerodrome. In doing this work, the squadron got the reputation of being one of the best, and fastest, all around construction squadrons in the AEF. In May 1918, the squadron was then reassigned to the First Army Air Service, and began constructing combat airfields to support the St. Mihiel Offensive. Throughout the year, it was moved from place to place, erecting hangars, constructing buildings and preparing airfields for use by Air Service planes. At Parois Aerodrome in the Meuse, it constructed 12 hangars and 23 barracks, the flying field being full of former trenches and shell holes that had to be filled in. During the Meuse- Argonne Offensive in early November, it moved to Buzancy to reconstruct a former German airfield that was littered with munitions and other hazardous materiel. However, the war ended on 11 November before the airfield could be put to use. After the armistice, the squadron was reassigned to the Third Army Air Service and moved to Trier Airdrome, Germany as part of the Army of Occupation. The former German Airfield there was prepared for seven American Aero Squadrons to use, which was done in less than a week. It then moved to Wei√üenthurm to construct another Aerodrome for Third Army. It remained in the Rhineland until the summer of 1919 until it was ordered, along with the Third Army Air Service to demobilized. After turning in all equipment at the 1st Air Depot at Colombey-les-Belles Aerodrome, the unit moved to a channel port where it boarded a troop ship, returning to the United States in August 1919. The men of the squadron were discharged and returned to civilian life. =Inter- war period= The 48th School Squadron was activated in 1927 as part of the 11th School Group at Kelly Field, Texas. A part of the Air Corps Primary Flying School, it trained aviation cadets using the Consolidated PT-1, with tandem seats and a Wright E engine.Maurer (1987) In 1930, the squadron was consolidated with the 462d Aero Squadron. By the fall of 1931, construction of Randolph Field was essentially completed, and the primary flying school at Kelly Field was moved to the new installation. With the transfer of the school, the 48th School Squadron was inactivated on 31 December 1931 It was activated again at the Air Corps Technical School at Chanute Field, Illinois in August 1933. In March 1935, the squadron became the 48th Pursuit Squadron, but it was inactivated in September 1936 and disbanded on 1 January 1938. =World War II= A new 48th Pursuit Squadron was activated in January 1941. The squadron was equipped with Lockheed P-38 Lightnings in 1941 and assigned to Hamilton Field, California. From 5 February to 3 June 1942 it flew air defense patrols along the California coast. Redesignated the 48th Fighter Squadron, it was deployed to the European Theater of Operations in August 1942 to fly escort missions for Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator heavy bombers as part of VIII Fighter Command. P-38 of the 48th Fighter Squadron ‚Äì Taken in North Africa The squadron was sent to North Africa in late 1942 as part of the Operation Torch invasion forces, taking up station in Algeria. It was reassigned to the Twelfth Air Force and flew fighter escort missions for the Flying Fortresses operating from Algeria as well as tactical interdiction strikes on enemy targets of opportunity in Algeria and Tunisia during the North African Campaign. Following the German defeat and withdrawal from North Africa the squadron participated in the Allied invasions of Sicily and Italy and the subsequent drive of the United States Fifth Army up the Italian peninsula. It was engaged primarily in tactical operations after November 1943, supporting ground forces and attacking enemy targets of opportunity such as railroads, road convoys, bridges, strafing enemy airfields and other targets. The squadron was deployed to Corsica in 1944 to attack enemy targets in support of the Free French Forces in the liberation of the island and to support Allied forces in the invasion of southern France. The squadron continued offensive operations until the German capitulation in May 1945. The unit was inactivated in the fall 1945 in Italy. =Cold War Air Defense= Convair F-102A-55-CO Delta Dagger 56-1017, about 1959 48th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron- F-15 ‚Äì Langley AFB It was reactivated in 1946 as part of Air Defense Command to perform air defense of the eastern United States. the squadron was activated at Dow Field in November 1946 with Republic P-47 Thunderbolts. In October 1947 a transition into Republic P-84B Thunderjets was completed. These were flown until the unit was temporarily inactivated on 2 October 1949. The squadron was redesignated the 48th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron and reactivated in November 1952 at Grenier Air Force Base, New Hampshire, with F-47 Thunderbolts, replacing the New Hampshire Air National Guard's 133d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, which was released from federal control. A relocation to Langley Air Force Base was completed in early 1953 along with a transition into F-84Gs and then Lockheed F-94C Starfires in the fall of 1953. In the summer of 1957 the squadron completed a transition into Convair F-102A Delta Daggers followed by another in the fall of 1960 to Convair F-106 Delta Darts. It deployed to Florida in 1962 during Cuban Missile Crisis. The 48th flew McDonnell Douglas F-15A Eagles from 1982 to 1991, when many of the F-15 were transferred to the Missouri and Hawaii Air National Guard, and 3 or 4 going to Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center. The 48th continued training and operational exercises until inactivation in 1991.

It was founded in 1979 by Luther Place Memorial Church in Washington, DC. Each year, LVC places approximately 100 volunteers in urban areas across the United States to work for social justice with various nonprofit organizations. The program lasts one to two years. The volunteers live together in the areas they serve and are encouraged to explore living simply and sustainably in intentional community. Current placement cities include Baltimore, Maryland, Chicago, Illinois, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Minneapolis‚ÄìSaint Paul, Minnesota, Omaha, Nebraska, Washington, D.C., and Wilmington, Delaware. In the past, volunteers have also been placed in Atlanta, Georgia, Berkeley, California, Detroit, Michigan, Jersey City, New Jersey, Port Huron, Michigan, San Francisco-Oakland, California, Seattle, Washington, and Tacoma, Washington.  History  In 1976, Luther Place Memorial Church in Washington, DC began to explore how the Lutheran community might initiate a voluntary service program. Luther Place and its senior pastor, John Steinbruck, were inspired by the Jesuit Volunteer Corps and the Mennonite Voluntary Service who had volunteers working in some of their outreach programs, such as DC Hotline and the Luther Place Night Shelter. After some discussion, a resolution was unanimously passed by the congregation, and in 1979 Luther Place organized the Lutheran Volunteer Corps (LVC). The first full year of LVC began in August 1980 with nine one-year volunteers working in nonprofit service organizations in Washington, DC. In 1982, LVC expanded to 27 volunteers in Washington, DC, Baltimore, Maryland, and Wilmington, Delaware. In 2003, LVC was formally incorporated as its own nonprofit organization. On December 1, 2008, Lutheran Service Corps (LSC) of Omaha, Nebraska, joined Lutheran Volunteer Corps at the initiation of the LSC Board of Directors. LVC volunteers began working in Omaha in August, 2009. In 2019, LVC's 40th anniversary, approximately 100 volunteers served in eight different cities across the United States.  Core values  Social justice ‚Äì LVC volunteers are placed in direct social service agencies or public policy organizations, working together for a peaceful world where basic human rights are met. LVC places emphasis on the injustice of racism, oppression, and privilege in its leadership development curriculum. Issue areas that are addressed through LVC include: food justice, legal aid, environment, housing, immigration, education, and health care. Some example placements at which LVC volunteers have served are the AIDS Foundation of Chicago, Bread for the City, Urban Ecology Center, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, and N Street Village. Simple and sustainable living ‚Äì LVC volunteers are encouraged to find ways to be more environmentally aware as well as work towards simplicity of time and focus on deepening relationships. Intentional community ‚Äì LVC volunteers live together in intentional community in order to encourage open communication and shared diversity. This creates a supportive space to engage in social justice, live sustainably, and explore meaning and vocation. LVC takes action to invite, include, and empower a broad representation of people in all aspects of their work and program. LVC believes racism and oppression must be confronted through intentional and often uncomfortable personal and institutional transformation. LVC welcomes and encourages the full participation of people of all sexual orientations, gender identities, and gender expressions. Exploring spirituality - LVC volunteers are encouraged to explore understanding of diverse beliefs and values. LVC welcomes and celebrates the participation of persons of any or no faith traditions. LVC is the most religiously diverse faith-based volunteer program in the United States. Though LVC is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, on average only about one third of the volunteers are Lutheran. One third are from other Christian denominations, and the last third come from a variety of other religious and spiritual traditions, including atheism and agnosticism.

After 11 kilometres, the N11 becomes its own road towards the south-south-east and meets the N1 Highway (southbound only) at the next junction just north of the N1's Nyl Toll Plaza. The N11 continues southwards for 72 kilometers to reach an intersection with the R33 Road. They become one road southwards into the town of Marble Hall (15 kilometres). The R33 and N11 remain as one road for another 27 kilometres south into the town of Groblersdal. At the junction with the north-eastern terminus of the R25 Road (4-way junction; staggered junction) in Groblersdal, the R33 becomes the road eastwards, leaving the N11 as the road southwards. The N11 continues for 33 kilometers, following the Olifants River, to cross into the Mpumalanga Province. =Mpumalanga= From the provincial border, the N11 continues southwards for another 52 kilometers to the city of Middelburg. It enters as Walter Sisulu Street. At the junction with Cowen Ntuli Street, the N11 meets the R555 and the R104 and they all become the road eastwards on Cowen Ntuli Street, which is the main road through Middelburg Central. Just after meeting the R35 Road's northern terminus, the R555 becomes its own road north-eastwards, leaving the R104 and N11 as the road eastwards. Just after the Eastdene Suburb, the N11 splits from the R104 to become the road towards the south-east. After the Nazareth and Rockdale suburbs, it meets the N4 Highway (Pretoria-Maputo Highway). The N11 proceeds south-south-east for 55 kilometres to the town of Hendrina, where it intersects with the R38 road in the town centre. It proceeds south-east for 50 kilometres to the city of Ermelo, where it meets the N17 from Eswatini (Swaziland). At the Fourie Street junction, the N17 joins the N11 southwards up to the junction with Joubert Street, where the N17 continues westwards. At Voortrekker Street south of Ermelo town centre, the N11 meets the terminus of the N2 from St. Lucia and Durban. From Ermelo, it runs south for 97 kilometres to the town of Volksrust, where it meets the south-eastern terminus of the R23 Road and becomes the Laing's Nek Pass. Just after, the N11 enters KwaZulu-Natal. =KwaZulu- Natal= From Volksrust, the N11 proceeds south for 45 kilometres to reach the town of Newcastle (bypassing its town centre). Just before Newcastle, the N11 is joined by the R34 until they split at an off-ramp north-east of the town centre. After being the Newcastle Eastern Bypass, the N11 proceeds south for 95 kilometres, meeting the R68 (which connects to Dundee), to reach the town of Ladysmith. It crosses the Klip River in the town centre and turns westwards to reach an off-ramp intersection with the R103 Road. The N11 and the R103 are one road south-south-west for 2 and a half kilometers, bypassing the Ladysmith Airport, before the N11 becomes its own road westwards and reaches its end at an off-ramp junction with the N3 Highway south of the N3's Tugela Toll Plaza. West of this junction, it is known as the R616 to Bergville. Road Status The N11 is arguably the worst road in South Africa, as it carries 1000 trucks a day due to being an alternate route between Limpopo and KwaZulu-Natal to the N3 freeway. (Avoiding Pretoria and Johannesburg; Avoiding Gauteng Province) (Being an alternative national route towards Botswana and Zimbabwe when coming from the port of Durban) Newcastle is the largest and main city along this scenic route. SANRAL has plans for upgrading the Newcastle bypass which encompasses bulking up of the various interchanges and partial realignment of the route. Currently this route is experiencing major roadwork and upgrade between Middelburg and Ermelo, Volksrust and Newcastle, Newcastle to the R68 Dundee interchange and Ladysmith to the N3 freeway.

History Ant√≥nio Santos J√∫nior The main building was constructed within a metal lattice by Francisco Goulard between 1888 and 1890. While the facade was completed by Cesare Ianz. The building was inaugurated on 14 August 1890. In 1897 the Geographical Society of Lisbon (') occupied part of the spaces, inaugurating the Portuguese Hall ('), authored by architect Jos√© Lu√≠s Monteiro (1849-1942) shortly after. Ant√≥nio Santos J√∫nior became director general of the Coliseu dos Recreios in the same year. On the death of Ant√≥nio Santos (1920), the direction of the Coliseu was assumed by Ricardo Cov√µes. A major refurbishment of the installations was completed in February 1994, that included remodelling of the hall and stage, and reconstruction of the surrounding spaces. On 22 August 2006, the Coliseu (owing to its stylistic, typological and historic importance) was designated for preservation. The DRCLisboa, on establishing the Special Protection Zone for the Castle of S√£o Jorge (and surroundings), included the building. As a Property of Public Interest, the National Council for Culture () proposed that archiving of the Special Protection Zone on 10 October 2011, which were necessitated on 18 October 2011 by IGESPAR. Architecture A view of the interior of the events hall of the Coliseu dos Recreios The Coliseu is actually two juxtapositioned buildings. This includes a rectangular three-story building, whose principal facade is oriented to the southwest. The first floor includes the Coliseu dos Recreios' atrium (94-98), the vestibule and bar-restaurant of the Sociedade de Geografia; the second floor, which as functions as library of the organization; and third floor, the Sala Portugal. The rectangular area is internally divided into three areas supported by steel pillars/columns, and interlinked by steel staircase, allowing circulation vertically. The twelve-sided events hall is encircled by seating and two floors of boxseating. To the northeast and southwest, respectively, are special boxseats, framed by three arches, over one of the three accesses. The hall is covered by metal ceiling, supported by steel tubing. The events hall has a capacity of between 2846 (seated) to 4000 people, depending on its configuration. Beside concerts, other shows are hosted there, including theatre, circus, dance shows and awards ceremonies. Performers have included Cirque du Soleil, Tango Fire, and several ballets.

The characters of the Japanese visual novel Popotan were designed by Akio Watanabe under the alias Poyoyon‚ô°Rock, and the characters in the anime adaptation were designed by Rondo Mizukami and based on Akio Watanabe's original concepts for the visual novel. The series takes place on a fictional Earth in which exist supernatural beings with powers and follows three such supernatural sisters as they travel through time in a mansion, searching for the reason for their journey. Though many of the characters in the visual novel share personality traits and character relations with their anime counterparts, there are numerous differences between the two media. Both the visual novel and anime have mutually exclusive characters in addition to the changes in character roles. In the visual novel, the player controls Chris, a slacker who roams from town to town until he comes across the unnamed town that is the setting of Popotan. The story centers on him as he moves in with three sisters and their maid (all of whom become the protagonists for the anime) and his transformation in his lifestyle. In the anime, the primary protagonists of the series are the three sisters, Ai, Mai and Mii. Ai is a compassionate, motherly figure whose overly compassionate nature often causes problems. Mai is a tomboy who wishes for the quest to end and to live a normal life. Mii is an energetic child who likes to cosplay and help people in trouble. Early on, the series explored the characters' personalities by focusing on a single character per episode. The sisters' maid, Mea, is portrayed as a secondary protagonist in the anime, but is portrayed as a primary protagonist in the radio drama that is a continuation of the anime. All of the protagonists from the anime, clockwise starting from the top: Mea, Mai, Mii, and Ai The main antagonists. From Left to right: Mea, Shizuku, and Keith Main characters =Chris= Image of the visual novel's protagonist, Chris. is the protagonist of the story whom the player controls. He is a high-school dropout and slacker who gave up on the world. He wanders from city to city playing his guitar to make just enough money to cover his living expenses. He moves in with the three sisters because they charge cheap rent and he likes staying in a house full of girls; however, he quickly learns he must change his slacker ways. As the game progresses, Chris has the possibility of developing a romantic relationship with one of the girls; at first this is limited to the three sisters: Ai, Mai and Mii, but after completing at least one of their routes, five other girls will be accessible. Since the visual novel revolves around him, the only time his character is seen is during event sequences; however, in the fan disc, his image is visually represented along with the other characters. =Sisters= In the visual novel their roles are as principal romancable characters for the protagonist while in the anime they, along with their maid, Mea, take on the roles of the protagonist. The three sisters, Ai, Mai and Mii, all have supernatural powers that differ based loosely on their personality type. All three live together under the same roof of a Western- style mansion with a maid helping take care of their needs. Ai , the oldest sister and acting landlord of the mansion. She is the only major character with large breasts and often wears a Santa Claus-style hat over her green hair. She is near-sighted and needs glasses to see clearly; additionally, she has a no sense of direction. Ai is a motherly figure and constantly tries to help people. She does most of the chores their maid does not, and, loves to cook despite being an incompetent. Her easygoing caring nature often leads her to fail things because she cannot muster the resolve to criticize others. Believing she is ugly and fat, Ai wears clothing and glasses to hide behind. This is why she allows Chris to stay with them when she finds out he has nowhere else to go. Ai also loves to take baths, more than once a day if possible. She also seems to be the de facto caretaker of the sisters' pet ferret, Unagi, which hides under her hat. Ai has the ability to speak to plants, specifically dandelions, which she and her sisters refer to as \\"popotan\\". In the anime, Ai becomes accustomed to the time traveling and non- aging and is mostly unaffected by it until she meets Daichi as an adult. She uses her ability help them find Shizuku, whom the sisters are searching for. Ai is voiced by Mayu Fujisaki in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Sayaka Ohara and in English by Nicole Oliver. Mai , the middle sister, has pink hair and usually wears sporty clothes. Mai is constantly reminded of her small breast size by her younger sister Mii, which causes her to lose her temper. Mai goes to school with Mii and has a friend there, Konami, who knows Chris from the past. Although she is the middle sister, Mai governs household affairs such as the budget. She longs to leave the mansion but does not want to burden Ai whom she knows does not have the willpower to deal with such responsibilities. Mai has a tomboyish personality and is very short-tempered, especially when it comes to Chris, the more so when she thinks she'll lose face. She is the only character who vehemently opposes Chris's staying at the mansion, despite the fact that he pays rent. Mai's role is more prominent in the anime. Early in the season she had problems with constantly moving; because she thought everyone hated her after making friends and then abandoning them, she became so depressed that she refused to go to school. She understood the impact of their journeys on others, but unlike Ai, did not have the maturity to cope with it. Early on in the series she makes friends with a classmate of hers, Konami. When it was time for Mai to leave, Konami helped convince Mai that she was wrong and in consolation Konami left a sketch portrait of Mai she made for a class assignment as a departing gift stating that they will remain friends forever, even if they never see each other again. While waiting for Mai's return, Konami passes away two years before the mansion is in a location where the two could meet again. Later in the series, Mai meets Konami's daughter; she initially mistakes her for Konami but quickly learns her name is Mai and that she was named by Konami in memory of her friend. Mai discovers that Konami's daughter has more in common with her than a name: she, like her namesake, feels that everyone hates her. As a result, Mai feels it her duty to both Konami and her daughter to show her that way of thinking was wrong, just as Konami did for her. Mai ultimately gave up and failed at the time when she Konami had still been waiting for her even as she lay dying. This, compounded with Keith's words about the pain the girls bring to others, reawakening her depression in a much deeper manner. When she returns to visit Konami later and leaves, as a departing request, asks Konami to explain to her daughter what she felt so that she would not follow the same path as the younger sister Mai. Along with Mea, the maid, Mai is left at one point when the mansion disappears into the future without them. It is during this time that Mai realizes that she cannot age and Ai explains the connection to the mansion and aging process. Mai is voiced by Mio Oukawa in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Masumi Asano and in English by Nicole Bouma. Mii , the youngest sister, has light purple hair that is often tied in a double- bun on her head, except when she cosplays as \\"Magical Girl Mii\\"; she then wears it in twin pony-tails. Mii goes to the same school as Mai. She goes around asking Chris to play with her almost anytime she sees him and loves to cosplay as a magical girl, \\"Magical Girl Mii\\", trying to help others out around town, though the results often vary. The game has more sexual scenes involving her than any other character. She tries to have sex with Chris early on and has sex with Mea, the maid, a few times. Mii is not as lascivious in the anime, though she has an obsession with defining plushy things, especially Ai's breasts. She also loves to compare breast sizes of various females. Also, though she passes through time like the rest of the girls, her very naivete and energy allow her to overcome most of the jumps with ease. \\"Magical Girl Mii\\" was used in the anime, though its origins were changed. In the anime it was a specialized cosplay costume she had created to mimic a magical girl television show which cost a lot of money, but Ai seemed easily able to pay for it. That episode she met a chronically ill girl named Miyuki and attempted to cheer up. After this, she wears it around and pretends to help stop evil and believes she has superpowers. Later during the episode, Miyuki collapsed from overexertion playing with Mii. Mii tried to use powers she thought she had to heal her. The attempt was successful, and Ai revealed to the viewers that Mii's special power was healing. However, Mii remains unaware of this for a good portion of the season, and continues to believe that she has other powers as well. After the episode, Mii continues to cosplay in the outfit with the same type of antics. Mii is voiced by Toromi in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Momoi Haruko and in English by Jocelyne Loewen. =Mea= , the sisters' maid, who is sometimes referred to as Mare in the visual novel and Mear in the fan book, is actually a lifelike android that has existed for a long time. Her scarlet hair is tied down into two long pigtails that reach her elbows. She appears completely unemotional, especially at the beginning of the game, but she has her own desires and becomes friendlier with Chris as the story progresses to varying degrees depending upon whether it's her scenario or not. In the anime, Mii constantly points out Mea's small breast size, though she does not lose her temper like Mai. She also has a voracious appetite despite her diminutive figure. She starts out more robotic-like, but becomes less so as the story progresses, such as in Episode 4 when she becomes concerned and fixes the doll of a malevolent-but- lonely child's spirit and seems to make some emotional connection to it. These scenes though are largely seen only by the audience and not by any of the major characters. Mea is left behind with Mai when the house vanishes after visiting the hot springs. She and Mai later rejoin the group, when the mansion returns five years later to the same spot. While waiting for the mansion to return, she works as a rental maid in the area to keep things up with Mai. It is later revealed that Mea is a \\"guard\\" sent to help the girls along their journey and that Mea is working with Shizuku under Keith. While Mea is listed officially as an android for the anime, it is unclear while watching Popotan that this is the case as there is no given reference, beyond her personality, to that effect. In episode four it is revealed she is not human, but the episode does not state what she is. Mea is voiced by Asumi Noda in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Mai Kadowaki and in English by Anna Cummer. =Shizuku= can be recognized by light-green hair and a similarly colored poncho. Her calm, mature demeanor contrasts with her youthful appearance, and her age is never mentioned. Chris meets her on a stroll at night and brings her back to the mansion. She lacks linguistic skills, and at first not much about her is learned. Because Shizuku is unable to take care of herself, Chris offers to pay her rent as well. In the anime, Shizuku is the reason for the girls' travels. She is portrayed as a goddess of the dandelions; for most of the anime, is referred to by the three sisters as \\"The One\\" as they do not know her name. When the sisters finally meet Shizuku, she tests them by offering them a choice between returning to a time period of their choice or continuing their time-traveling. Shizuku is voiced by Minami Nagasaki in the visual novel and by Rumi Shishido in the Japanese anime and by Nicole Leroux in the English anime. Secondary Characters =Konami= was Chris's girlfriend before he dropped out and left his old town; when she starts attending Mai's school, she and Mai become best friends. She has long brown hair and like most of the others, small breasts. Konami is a trendy, cheerful and optimistic girl with almost as much energy as Mii and just as much naivety. She rarely thinks of the consequences of her actions. In the anime, she is responsible for breaking Mai's cyclical nature of her depression. She becomes a great artist and eventually has a daughter who she decided to name Mai; Mai, the sister, eventually meets her in the future and at first mistakes her for Konami. When Mai, the sister, returns to be with Konami after meeting with Konami, she asks Konami to teach her daughter that both of them enjoyed their friendship and never resented the other for leaving, hoping to change the personality of Mai. Konami is voiced by Miki Haruse in the visual novel, by Tomoko Kawakami in the Japanese anime, and by Tabitha St. Germain in the English anime. =Nono= is a shy, blue-haired shrine maiden-in-training and daughter of the Goshintai clan who takes her training seriously. She takes care with cleaning the shrine and commutes to the same school as the rest of the girls. She also tries to do fortune telling in the city, though she is infamous for getting her fortunes wrong. She is the first major character Chris is introduced to in the game. At first she does not seem to fond of him because of his slacker mentality, but eventually gets over that. In the anime, Nono is one of Mii's closest friends, though Nono seems to show quickly signs of wearing out under Mii's constant enthusiasm because she is slightly older than Mii and has been under rigorous training by her grandfather whom she cares for every much despite his often harsh treatment of ways, especially holidays like Christmas.In Japan, Christmas is celebrated by most Japanese people, for whom it is a secular holiday for dedicated to get togethers and gift exchanges with friends and family. Christmas Eve is generally observed more than Christmas day. Nono is voiced by Junko Kusayanagi in the visual novel, by Sakura Nogawa in the Japanese anime, and by Brenna O'Brien in the English anime. =Claude= is Chris's rival. Like Chris, Claude also plays the guitar, though he is more of a rock-star mentality. He has reddish-brown hair and wears black clothing with his guitar strapped to his back. Depending upon how the story unfolds, Claude's appearance may be closer to that of a minor character in certain scenarios, though he still plays a key role in several endings. He is central to Konami's scenario as he attempts to rape her in it after he and some other members of his band seduce her, specifically because she has a relation with Chris. Since she is enthralled with Claude because he's a rockstar, she is easily blinded. In Mii's scenario, one of her several \\"Magical Gril Mii\\" mini-games involve Claude. =Daichi= is a very kind and protective person. He is the first person seen in the anime as he takes pictures of the mansion which some students say is haunted. When he learns the truth, the girls decide to help him out. He, like Ai, goes out of his way to help his friends and is likely why the two connect. In the year 2000, as an adult, Daichi's daughter takes a picture at the beach and he sees the mansion where the girls lived, but obviously not in the same location he visited it. He goes to see them and meets Ai who becomes agitated because she does not know what to do. At the time she denies any connection, but later when he returns and is attacked by Keith she reveals the truth. As a child, Daichi is voiced in Japanese by Yuki Kaida and as an adult by Kenichi Suzumura; as a child, he is voiced in English by Reece Thompson and as an adult by Kirby Morrow. =Keith= plays a role, along with Mea, as a \\"guide\\" and has special abilities similar to the girls. He first appears wearing a business suit with his distinguishing white hair in an attempt to help out Ai dissuade an adult Daichi who she really is because of the nature of the mansion and their agelessness. At first she welcomes him and sleeps with him, but later resents him after he attacks Daichi. Later on, Keith tries to convince Mai the actions they take only end up hurting those they befriend. Keith works under Shizuku like Mea, but stronger and higher ranked than she. He often disagrees with her about the three sisters. While it appears he's trying to work against the girls, in one of the final scenes he's shown to be content with the decision they eventually make. Keith is voiced by Yuuji Takada in Japanese and by Brian Drummond in English. Other characters =Kokoa= has brown hair pulled back in a double braid and wears glasses. She is a manager of a rival convenience stores. Because of this, she comes off quite hostile to Chris at first. Kokoa is semi-hidden romanceable character, though her level of interaction otherwise would be indistinguishable with a minor character. She is not listed among the official main characters on sites like Getchu, but does have her own character image and scene reminisce section. Kokoa is voiced by Mayu Ayatayo in the visual novel. =Unagi= , is a white female ferret that can transform into a humanoid hybrid; she is the only notable such hybrid of its type in any form of literature. In her humanoid form, Unagi is indistinguishable from a normal human except for her white tail. She also has white hair as well. She does not get along with Mii at all as Mii becomes jealous of the time she spends with Chris. Unagi is essentially the mascot character for the series in both forms. She is used in the character menus for the navigating the game and introduces the next episode in her humanoid form in the anime. In the game, she only appears in her humanoid form after completing Ai's route and choosing to play post-game scenario when starting a new game. In the anime, she is essentially the family's pet and is found usually around Ai and dislikes Mii who torments her at times. She never transforms in any of the episodes and it's unclear whether she can. In the episode preview at the end of episode one, she explains she can, but the segment is in an out-of-storyline context. Unagi' is voiced by Kanon Torii in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Ayako Kawasumi and in English by Tabitha St. Germain. =Asuka= is a female classmate of Daichi's who the latter has a crush on. Asuka believes in spirits because her grandmother died prior to the story's beginning and she felt that her grandmother's spirit was still around. When Daichi takes photos of the mansion, she's happy and even after they are found to be fake, she still is thankful for the gesture Daichi made to cheer her up. Later in the series, she marries Daichi, and makes an appearance as an adult in episode 7. Asuka is voiced by in Japanese Mai Nakahara and by in English Kelly Sheridan. =Mai (Konami's Daughter)= , Konami's daughter, is visually an exact duplicate of Konami. Emotionally she is completely the opposite. Where Konami was optimistic, she is pessimistic; where Konami was outgoing, she is an introvert; where her mother cherished Mai, the sister, she hates her. She appears only in the anime. Mai, the daughter, eventually meets Mai, the middle sister, who at first mistakes her for Konami as they look exactly alike. The daughter resents Mai, the middle sister, for abandoning her mother which further deepens the latter Mai's depression. Konami's daughter, Mai, develops a similar personality to that of the other Mai in that she chooses to close herself off from having friends. In the final episode, an adult Mai explains the travels to Daisuke, the male child of Asuka and Daichi. Mai is voiced by in Japanese Tomoko Kawakami and in English Maggie Blue O'Hara. =Miyuki= is a young girl who lives at the hospital due to having a weak body since birth. She enjoys watching the \\"Magical Girl Lilo\\" cartoon and after her father meets Mii who is at the cosplaying with the evidential outfit. After Mii forces her to dress up as well and they go around town, Miyuki collapses due to her weakness whereupon Mii uses her healing powers curing Miyuki of her weakness permanently. Miyuki is voiced in Japanese by Mikako Takahashi and by in English Brenna O'Brien. Merchandise Popotan has had a number of merchandise based on the female characters. All of the major romanceable girls from the game have had figurines designed for them, with Mii getting additional ones from other sets. Resin model kits for all of the major protagonists as well as other important female characters have been released, several of which are in different poses and Mai's displaying a bare chest. Petit Ferret also released a cell-phone card set, dripping matt, and other items based around the anime's protagonists.

These games, where Unagi is the heroine, are meant to humorous and fun. The second one allows Unagi to transform into her humanoid form after a certain point in the game. Reception =Visual novel= The visual novel's Japanese voice actor have all commented on their time working on the title. Mayu Fujisaki comments that her time spent of Ai's character was a valuable experience. She comments that Ai is cute, gentle and tolerant. =Anime= Mania states that Mea is \\"[t]he oddest of the [main] characters\\" since she appears first as very robotic in both action and appearance, but as the story progresses and her personality evolves becomes less so. Another Mania reviewer claims that Mai, the middle sister, is by far the most interesting of the characters since her episodes revolve around the struggle of trying to live an ordinary life when doing so it impossible and thus her story outshines the other main characters' stories. In a second review, the former Mania reviewer did praise the way the anime brought back Daichi as an adult and the way the anime handled the issues that would likely occur with such a fantastical encounter, though in another review by the same author he criticizes the anime for placing Mai and Mii on the journey through time and space since they'll never have a chance to grow up, although he later admits he might be reading too much into things. All of the female characters, but especially Mii's, bath and other partial nudity scenes from anime sparked a lot of controversy when the anime was released on North American DVDs as they had a lot uncensored images of the character's chests, though Akio Watanabe is still credited with having great character designs. Mania stats that most of the main anime characters are mostly visually appealing, though still stereotypical, designs and claims \\"the most interesting looking character\\" is Konami with Miyuki close behind. Mania goes further and claims that Miyuki actually fills the costume better cosplaying as a \\"Magical Girl\\" than Mii.

Liberal politics Martin was elected Liberal Member of Parliament for East Aberdeenshire at the 1922 general election. It was rare for anyone with a disability to get elected to Parliament but his blindness during war service brought him a great deal of personal sympathy.The Times, 18 January 1924 He held the seat at the 1923 general election but was defeated in 1924 when he faced a three-cornered contest. He tried unsuccessfully to re-enter Parliament as Liberal candidate for Central Aberdeenshire at the 1929 general election. Labour After the 1929 general election, Martin defected from the Liberals to Labour, succumbing to a feeling that this was the end of the line for the old Liberal party. Despite the party having fought a spirited and radical campaign under the leadership of David Lloyd George it had failed to break back into power. According to one historian, Martin was one of a number of MPs, former MPs and candidates who could no longer imagine the circumstances in which the party could ever succeed again.Trevor Wilson, The Downfall of the Liberal Party; Cornell University Press, 1966 p351 He stood for Parliament, now in the Labour interest, contesting East Aberdeenshire at the general elections of 1931 and 1935.

Background When Benito Mussolini took over as Prime Minister of Italy in 1922 the economy was in a bad state following World War I. Between 1922 and 1925, the financial and economic situation generally improved dramatically and this helped to increase the power of Italy, who strived to be one of the world's leading countries. Italy wanted to restore some of its purchasing power. But in order for this to happen it was vital that they had a strong currency, the Lira. Mussolini took the view that a weak lira would look bad for the country when presenting Italy as a great power across Europe and the United States. Details =Aims= The policy had a number of aims. These comprised: *to fix the lira at a rate of 90 (\\"Quota 90\\") to the pound Sterling (¬£) *to reduce inflation *to confirm the image of Fascism bringing stability *to show the world that Italy could be a great force, with a strong currency Back in October 1922 (when Mussolini first became prime minister), 90 lira to ¬£1 (British pound) had been the prevailing rate but it had declined sharply, even reaching 150 lira to ¬£1 in 1926. =Actions= The policy was confirmed at the Pesaro Speech on 18 August 1926 and was given the name Quota 90, referring to the value they wanted to achieve. Results The revaluation hit Italy's export trade, but, by making imports cheaper, benefited heavy industries, such as steel and chemicals, which relied on imported raw materials. These industries later provided the basis for an expanded rearmament industry and so supported the 'active' foreign policy, which became the chief characteristic of the fascist state. Tariffs on undesirable imports such as consumer goods and foodstuffs kept their high price and restricted demand, protecting Mussolini's Battle for grain policy. However, Italian workers were pressured into accepting wage cuts to match the new value of the lira to the point where wages fell more than food prices and living standards for working-class Italians rapidly declined.

Born in Poland in 1921, Chall was deeply committed to teaching, to the importance of children's successful reading acquisition and the need to address failing readers, to the power of research to answer practical questions, and to the merit of understanding the historical background of research questions. Though her views were often controversial, she was respected by her peers for the meticulous research. Her conclusions about the best way to approach beginning reading were unpopular when she first presented them, though they have subsequently gained acceptance in the literacy community. Chall's professional life was committed to children's successful reading acquisition, especially low S.E.S. (socioeconomic status) children's. She was also committed to finding answers to failure among readers. She responded to the national concern over why many children were not learning to read well, made popular by Rudolf Flesch's Why Johnny Can't Read, by writing Learning to Read: The Great Debate.Chall, J.S. (1996). Learning to read: The great debate. Fort Worth: Harcourt Brace College Publishers. She and Edgar Dale also developed a formula, the Dale-Chall Readability Formula, in 1948 which was considered the most valid and reliable of its kind for determining the readability of texts for several decades. In 1983, Chall added Stages of Reading Development to her literacy contributions. Later, in 1996, she and three of her graduate students developed the Qualitative Assessment of Text Difficulty: A Practical Guide for Teachers and Writers. Chall retired from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in 1991. She died at 78 in Cambridge, Massachusetts on November 27, 1999. Biographical information Born in Poland, Chall migrated at the age of seven to New York City with her family. Unlike her older siblings, Chall began her schooling in the US and ultimately helped to teach her parents English so that they could pass their citizenship exams. She graduated from the City College of New York in 1941 with a B.B.A. She served as research assistant to Edgar Dale at Ohio State University, where she received a M.A. in 1947 and a Ph.D. in 1952. Between 1950 and 1965 Chall rose from lecturer to professor at City College. Later she became the director of the Harvard Reading Laboratory at Harvard University. Chall died in 1999 at the age of 78. The Between the Lions episode \\"The Fox and the Crow\\" was dedicated to her memory. Major contributions In 1965 Chall moved to Harvard University to create and direct graduate programs in reading for master's and doctoral candidates. She founded the Harvard Reading Laboratory in 1967, directing it until she retired in 1991. The laboratory is now named after her. She served on the board of directors of the International Reading Association, 1961‚Äì1964, and on the National Academy of Education's Commission on Reading that resulted in the report Becoming a Nation of Readers (1985). She received many professional awards, last given to her in 1996. Chall's most important professional contribution was a byproduct of the professional furor over Rudolf Flesch's Why Johnny Can't Read‚ÄîAnd What You Can Do About It (1955). Flesch attacked the prevailing ideas, saying that reading professionals had ignored their own research. Chall's Learning to Read the Great Debate (1967) quickly became a classic. Major textbook publishers reacted by emphasizing more phonics earlier in their series. Chall's book was updated in 1983 (3rd edition in 1996) with even stronger research findings to support its conclusions. Stages of Reading Development was published in 1983. In 1996, Chall and three graduate students wrote a guide to evaluating the level of texts' reading difficulty, Qualitative Assessment of Text Difficulty: A Practical Guide for Teachers and Writers. Chall's last work, published posthumously, was The Academic Challenge: What Really Works in the Classroom (2000). In it, she divides American instruction into \\"child-centered\\" and \\"teacher-centered\\" approaches, suggesting that the 20th century was dominated by the former (discovery approaches) in spite of the research that supported a later theory (explicit teaching).

Alexander Macrae was the stationmaster appointed on 28 October 1904 having been promoted from Inverness station and remaining until closure on 7 August 1915. Infrastructure The station had two platforms and loop line with originally a goods siding and loading dock to the north, later a second loading dock and sidings were added on the \\"down\\" side. The station building was on the \\"up\\" side and was 2.5 miles from Keith railway station. A stationmasters' house was provided as was a porters' house. Located on a gradient of 1 in 60 the gradient eased a little to the north at 1 in 70. On 7 November 1917 the Admiralty requisitioned the track between Aultmore and Portessie for use at Invergordon and Inverness however in June 1918 they also lifted the track between Aultmore and Crooksmill, leaving however the station buildings and sidings intact. In June 1919 the Highland Railway relaid the section to Aultmore from Crooksmill and resumed goods services at the request of the local authorities. In 1925 the station buildings were restored however they were never used for passenger services. In 1937 the track was simplified and realigned to provide a layout of just two sidings and by this time the platforms had been reduced to just banks of earth. By 10 December 1937 the track between Aultmore and Buckie had once again been lifted. The Keith signal lineman made regular visits to Aultmore to maintain the ground lever frame and the Distillery Manager's Office had a railway telephone for the purposes of ordering the delivery of waggons. =Signalling= Signalling was by block telegraph and semaphore signals with the first section being Keith West to Forgie (Aultmore), followed by Forgie (Aultmore) to Enzie. The line was usually worked on a 'one engine in steam' principle, special trains being timed so as not to conflict with the regular timetabled services. Services The timetable for the first regular services shows four trains in each direction however as they were all \\"mixed\\" trains the passengers were required to wait whilst shunting of goods waggons took place. In 1907 the summer timetable showed five trains in each direction, reducing to three in the winter. A 12:50 pm goods train ran from Portessie to work the goods stations at Buckie and Aultmore, the local goods from Keith being withdrawn. From 1 November 1907 the engine was withdrawn from Portessie and instead a 2:15 pm ran to Aultmore to work the goods station as and when required. A daily 5:00 pm return goods ran from 1919 Services were suspended between 1943 and 1945 and finally ceased in 1966. The site today The stationmasters' house is in use as a private home.

The cemetery is three-quarters of a mile (1.2 km) north of the Joseph Bailly Homestead on the edge of a sand ridge. The first recorded burial was Robert, the son of Joseph Bailly, in about 1827. Subsequently, the site has been considered a family graveyard. Burials of those outside the Bailly family are numerous. Today, they are all unmarked, including Swedish residents of the area. Outside the cemetery platform to the north there are eight recorded tombstones, four of which are older than 1827: Isaac Schellinger, 1811; Peter Carlbon, 1814; Rhoda Schellinger, 1816; and Thomas B. Speer, 1817.Bailly Homestead Unit, Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore; A. Berle Clemesen; National Park Service, pg 11 Cemetery history In 1827, Joseph Bailly chose the sand hill as a resting place for his son Robert. He placed a thirty-foot wooden cross near the grave which travelers on the nearby trial could easily view. Why he buried his son on this hill, three-fourths of a mile from the home, can only be speculated. Perhaps he did so because it had already been used for burials. More likely, since he marked the place with a large cross, he chose the highest point in the area. The entire Joseph Bailly family is interred in this cemetery. There are also a stepdaughter, son-in- law, and several grandchildren. In the early years, the Swedish community also used this site as a cemetery, until Rose Bailly Howe restricted it to the Bailly family after 1866. Rose Howe had the grounds enclosed with a wooden fence around 1867. In 1885 she had a six-foot (1.8 m) limestone wall topped with iron spikes erected. Access was through an iron gate on the south side. On the inside walls, three boxes with rounded tops were included with the stations of the cross. An altar was built in the southeast corner. A cross had been erected in the center of the cemetery by Joseph Bailly in 1827. By 1914, Miss Frances R. Howe worried about entry into the cemetery and had Theodore Stephens of Chesterton construct a concrete block wall around the old one. Stairs at the north end lead up to the top and a stone railing with ornamental coping was erected. The interior of the cemetery was filled with sand. Memorial plaques were moved from inside the walls to the outside at the north end. The entire raised platform was encircled by a concrete retaining wall and driveway.

In fluid dynamics, the mild-slope equation describes the combined effects of diffraction and refraction for water waves propagating over bathymetry and due to lateral boundaries‚Äîlike breakwaters and coastlines. It is an approximate model, deriving its name from being originally developed for wave propagation over mild slopes of the sea floor. The mild-slope equation is often used in coastal engineering to compute the wave-field changes near harbours and coasts. The mild-slope equation models the propagation and transformation of water waves, as they travel through waters of varying depth and interact with lateral boundaries such as cliffs, beaches, seawalls and breakwaters. As a result, it describes the variations in wave amplitude, or equivalently wave height. From the wave amplitude, the amplitude of the flow velocity oscillations underneath the water surface can also be computed. These quantities‚Äîwave amplitude and flow-velocity amplitude‚Äîmay subsequently be used to determine the wave effects on coastal and offshore structures, ships and other floating objects, sediment transport and resulting bathymetric changes of the sea bed and coastline, mean flow fields and mass transfer of dissolved and floating materials. Most often, the mild-slope equation is solved by computer using methods from numerical analysis. A first form of the mild-slope equation was developed by Eckart in 1952, and an improved version‚Äîthe mild- slope equation in its classical formulation‚Äîhas been derived independently by Juri Berkhoff in 1972. Thereafter, many modified and extended forms have been proposed, to include the effects of, for instance: wave‚Äìcurrent interaction, wave nonlinearity, steeper sea-bed slopes, bed friction and wave breaking. Also parabolic approximations to the mild-slope equation are often used, in order to reduce the computational cost. In case of a constant depth, the mild- slope equation reduces to the Helmholtz equation for wave diffraction.  Formulation for monochromatic wave motion  For monochromatic waves according to linear theory‚Äîwith the free surface elevation given as \\\\zeta(x,y,t)=\\\\Re\\\\left{\\\\eta(x,y)\\\\,\\\\text{e}^{-i\\\\omega t}\\\\right} and the waves propagating on a fluid layer of mean water depth h(x,y)‚Äîthe mild-slope equation is: : abla\\\\cdot\\\\left( c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, abla \\\\eta \\\\right)\\\\, +\\\\, k^2\\\\, c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, \\\\eta\\\\, =\\\\, 0, where: *\\\\eta(x,y) is the complex-valued amplitude of the free-surface elevation \\\\zeta(x,y,t); *(x,y) is the horizontal position; *\\\\omega is the angular frequency of the monochromatic wave motion; *i is the imaginary unit; *\\\\Re{\\\\cdot} means taking the real part of the quantity between braces; * abla is the horizontal gradient operator; * abla\\\\cdot is the divergence operator; *k is the wavenumber; *c_p is the phase speed of the waves and *c_g is the group speed of the waves. The phase and group speed depend on the dispersion relation, and are derived from Airy wave theory as: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\omega^2 &=\\\\, g\\\\, k\\\\, \\\\tanh\\\\, (kh), \\\\ c_p &=\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\omega}{k} \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\ c_g &=\\\\, \\\\frac12\\\\, c_p\\\\, \\\\left[ 1\\\\, +\\\\, kh\\\\, \\\\frac{1 - \\\\tanh^2 (kh)}{\\\\tanh\\\\, (kh)} \\\\right] \\\\end{align} where *g is Earth's gravity and *\\\\tanh is the hyperbolic tangent. For a given angular frequency \\\\omega, the wavenumber k has to be solved from the dispersion equation, which relates these two quantities to the water depth h.  Transformation to an inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation  Through the transformation :\\\\psi\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\eta\\\\, \\\\sqrt{c_p\\\\, c_g}, the mild slope equation can be cast in the form of an inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation: : \\\\Delta\\\\psi\\\\, +\\\\, k_c^2\\\\, \\\\psi\\\\, =\\\\, 0 \\\\qquad \\\\text{with} \\\\qquad k_c^2\\\\, =\\\\, k^2\\\\, -\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\Delta\\\\left(\\\\sqrt{c_p\\\\,c_g}\\\\right)}{\\\\sqrt{c_p\\\\,c_g}}, where \\\\Delta is the Laplace operator.  Propagating waves  In spatially coherent fields of propagating waves, it is useful to split the complex amplitude \\\\eta(x,y) in its amplitude and phase, both real valued: :\\\\eta(x,y)\\\\, =\\\\, a(x,y)\\\\, \\\\text{e}^{i\\\\, \\\\theta(x,y)}, where *a=\\\\eta\\\\, is the amplitude or absolute value of \\\\eta\\\\, and *\\\\theta=\\\\arg{\\\\eta}\\\\, is the wave phase, which is the argument of \\\\eta.\\\\, This transforms the mild-slope equation in the following set of equations (apart from locations for which abla\\\\theta is singular): : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\kappa_y}{\\\\partial{x}}\\\\, -\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\kappa_x}{\\\\partial{y}}\\\\, =\\\\, 0 \\\\qquad &\\\\text{ with } \\\\kappa_x\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\theta}{\\\\partial{x}} \\\\text{ and } \\\\kappa_y\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\theta}{\\\\partial{y}}, \\\\ \\\\kappa^2\\\\, =\\\\, k^2\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\frac{ abla\\\\cdot\\\\left( c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, abla a \\\\right)}{c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, a} \\\\qquad &\\\\text{ with } \\\\kappa\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\sqrt{\\\\kappa_x^2 \\\\, +\\\\, \\\\kappa_y^2} \\\\quad \\\\text{ and} \\\\ abla \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol{v}_g\\\\, E \\\\right)\\\\, =\\\\, 0 \\\\qquad &\\\\text{ with } E\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\frac12\\\\, \\\\rho\\\\, g\\\\, a^2 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\boldsymbol{v}_g\\\\, =\\\\, c_g\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\kappa}}{k}, \\\\end{align} where * E is the average wave-energy density per unit horizontal area (the sum of the kinetic and potential energy densities), * \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\kappa} is the effective wavenumber vector, with components (\\\\kappa_x,\\\\kappa_y),\\\\, * \\\\boldsymbol{v}_g is the effective group velocity vector, * \\\\rho is the fluid density, and * g is the acceleration by the Earth's gravity. The last equation shows that wave energy is conserved in the mild-slope equation, and that the wave energy E is transported in the \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\kappa}-direction normal to the wave crests (in this case of pure wave motion without mean currents). The effective group speed \\\\boldsymbol{v}_g is different from the group speed c_g. The first equation states that the effective wavenumber \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\kappa} is irrotational, a direct consequence of the fact it is the derivative of the wave phase \\\\theta, a scalar field. The second equation is the eikonal equation. It shows the effects of diffraction on the effective wavenumber: only for more-or-less progressive waves, with  abla\\\\cdot(c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, abla a)\\\\ll k^2\\\\, c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, a, the splitting into amplitude a and phase \\\\theta leads to consistent-varying and meaningful fields of a and \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\kappa}. Otherwise, Œ∫2 can even become negative. When the diffraction effects are totally neglected, the effective wavenumber Œ∫ is equal to k, and the geometric optics approximation for wave refraction can be used. When \\\\eta=a\\\\mbox{ }\\\\exp(i\\\\theta) is used in the mild-slope equation, the result is, apart from a factor \\\\exp(i\\\\theta): : c_p\\\\,c_g\\\\, \\\\left( \\\\Delta a\\\\, +\\\\, 2i\\\\, abla a \\\\cdot abla\\\\theta\\\\, -\\\\, a\\\\, abla\\\\theta \\\\cdot abla\\\\theta\\\\, +\\\\, i\\\\, a\\\\, \\\\Delta\\\\theta \\\\right)\\\\, +\\\\, abla \\\\left( c_p\\\\, c_g \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left( abla a\\\\, +\\\\, i\\\\, a\\\\, abla\\\\theta \\\\right)\\\\, +\\\\, k^2\\\\, c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, a\\\\, =\\\\, 0. Now both the real part and the imaginary part of this equation have to be equal to zero: : \\\\begin{align} & c_p\\\\,c_g\\\\, \\\\Delta a\\\\, -\\\\, c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, a\\\\, abla\\\\theta \\\\cdot abla\\\\theta\\\\, +\\\\, abla \\\\left( c_p\\\\, c_g \\\\right) \\\\cdot abla a\\\\, +\\\\, k^2\\\\, c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, a\\\\, =\\\\, 0 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\ & 2\\\\, c_p\\\\,c_g\\\\, abla a \\\\cdot abla\\\\theta\\\\, +\\\\, c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, a\\\\, \\\\Delta\\\\theta\\\\, +\\\\, abla \\\\left( c_p\\\\, c_g \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left( a\\\\, abla\\\\theta \\\\right)\\\\, =\\\\, 0. \\\\end{align} The effective wavenumber vector \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\kappa} is defined as the gradient of the wave phase: :\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\kappa}\\\\, =\\\\, abla\\\\theta and its vector length is \\\\kappa=\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\kappa}. Note that \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\kappa} is an irrotational field, since the curl of the gradient is zero: : abla\\\\, \\\\times\\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\kappa}\\\\, =\\\\, 0. Now the real and imaginary parts of the transformed mild-slope equation become, first multiplying the imaginary part by a: : \\\\begin{align} &\\\\kappa^2\\\\, =\\\\, k^2\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\frac{ abla(c_p\\\\, c_g)}{c_p\\\\, c_g} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{ abla a}{a}\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\Delta a}{a} \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\ &c;_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, abla\\\\left(a^2\\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\kappa}\\\\, +\\\\, c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, abla\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\kappa}\\\\, +\\\\, a^2\\\\, \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\kappa} \\\\cdot abla \\\\left( c_p\\\\, c_g \\\\right)\\\\, =\\\\, 0. \\\\end{align} The first equation directly leads to the eikonal equation above for \\\\kappa\\\\,, while the second gives: : abla \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\kappa}\\\\, c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, a^2 \\\\right)\\\\, =\\\\, 0, which‚Äîby noting that c_p=\\\\omega/k in which the angular frequency \\\\omega is a constant for time-harmonic motion‚Äîleads to the wave-energy conservation equation.  Derivation of the mild-slope equation  The mild-slope equation can be derived by the use of several methods. Here, we will use a variational approach. The fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible, and the flow is assumed to be irrotational. These assumptions are valid ones for surface gravity waves, since the effects of vorticity and viscosity are only significant in the Stokes boundary layers (for the oscillatory part of the flow). Because the flow is irrotational, the wave motion can be described using potential flow theory. = Luke's variational principle = Luke's Lagrangian formulation gives a variational formulation for non-linear surface gravity waves. For the case of a horizontally unbounded domain with a constant density \\\\rho, a free fluid surface at z=\\\\zeta(x,y,t) and a fixed sea bed at z=-h(x,y), Luke's variational principle \\\\delta\\\\mathcal{L}=0 uses the Lagrangian : \\\\mathcal{L} = \\\\int_{t_0}^{t_1} \\\\iint L\\\\; \\\\text{d}x\\\\; \\\\text{d}y\\\\; \\\\text{d}t, where L is the horizontal Lagrangian density, given by: : L = -\\\\rho\\\\, \\\\left{ \\\\int_{-h(x,y)}^{\\\\zeta(x,y,t)} \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial t} +\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left( \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right)^2 \\\\+ \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right)^2 \\\\+ \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right)^2 \\\\right) \\\\right]\\\\; \\\\text{d}z\\\\; +\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\, g\\\\, (\\\\zeta^2\\\\, -\\\\, h^2) \\\\right}, where \\\\Phi(x,y,z,t) is the velocity potential, with the flow velocity components being \\\\partial\\\\Phi/\\\\partial{x}, \\\\partial\\\\Phi/\\\\partial{y} and \\\\partial\\\\Phi/\\\\partial{z} in the x, y and z directions, respectively. Luke's Lagrangian formulation can also be recast into a Hamiltonian formulation in terms of the surface elevation and velocity potential at the free surface. Taking the variations of \\\\mathcal{L}(\\\\Phi,\\\\zeta) with respect to the potential \\\\Phi(x,y,z,t) and surface elevation \\\\zeta(x,y,t) leads to the Laplace equation for \\\\Phi in the fluid interior, as well as all the boundary conditions both on the free surface z=\\\\zeta(x,y,t) as at the bed at z=-h(x,y). = Linear wave theory = In case of linear wave theory, the vertical integral in the Lagrangian density L is split into a part from the bed z=-h to the mean surface at z=0, and a second part from z=0 to the free surface z=\\\\zeta. Using a Taylor series expansion for the second integral around the mean free-surface elevation z=0, and only retaining quadratic terms in \\\\Phi and \\\\zeta, the Lagrangian density L_0 for linear wave motion becomes : L_0 = -\\\\rho\\\\, \\\\left{ \\\\zeta\\\\, \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial t} \\\\right]_{z=0}\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\int_{-h}^0 \\\\frac12 \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right)^2 \\\\+ \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial y} \\\\right)^2 \\\\+ \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial z} \\\\right)^2 \\\\right]\\\\; \\\\text{d}z\\\\; +\\\\, \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\, g\\\\, \\\\zeta^2\\\\, \\\\right}. The term \\\\partial\\\\Phi/\\\\partial{t} in the vertical integral is dropped since it has become dynamically uninteresting: it gives a zero contribution to the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations, with the upper integration limit now fixed. The same is true for the neglected bottom term proportional to h^2 in the potential energy. The waves propagate in the horizontal (x,y) plane, while the structure of the potential \\\\Phi is not wave-like in the vertical z-direction. This suggests the use of the following assumption on the form of the potential \\\\Phi: :\\\\Phi(x,y,z,t) = f(z;x,y)\\\\, \\\\varphi(x,y,t) with normalisation f(0;x,y)=1 at the mean free-surface elevation z=0. Here \\\\varphi(x,y,t) is the velocity potential at the mean free-surface level z=0. Next, the mild-slope assumption is made, in that the vertical shape function f changes slowly in the (x,y)-plane, and horizontal derivatives of f can be neglected in the flow velocity. So: : \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial{x}} [2ex] \\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial{y}} [2ex] \\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\Phi}{\\\\partial{z}} \\\\end{pmatrix}\\\\, \\\\approx\\\\, \\\\begin{pmatrix} \\\\displaystyle f\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\varphi}{\\\\partial{x}} [2ex] \\\\displaystyle f\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\varphi}{\\\\partial{y}} [2ex] \\\\displaystyle \\\\frac{\\\\partial{f}}{\\\\partial{z}}\\\\, \\\\varphi \\\\end{pmatrix}. As a result: : L_0 = -\\\\rho\\\\, \\\\left{ \\\\zeta\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\varphi}{\\\\partial t}\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\frac12\\\\, F\\\\, \\\\left[ \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\varphi}{\\\\partial{x}} \\\\right)^2\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\varphi}{\\\\partial{y}} \\\\right)^2 \\\\right]\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\frac12\\\\, G\\\\, \\\\varphi^2\\\\, +\\\\, \\\\frac12\\\\, g\\\\, \\\\zeta^2\\\\, \\\\right}, with F\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\int_{-h}^0 f^2\\\\; \\\\text{d}z and G\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\int_{-h}^0 \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\text{d}f}{\\\\text{d}z}\\\\right)^2\\\\; \\\\text{d}z. The Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations for this Lagrangian density L_0 are, with \\\\xi(x,y,t) representing either \\\\varphi or \\\\zeta: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial{L_0}}{\\\\partial\\\\xi} \\\\- \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial{t}}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial{L_0}}{\\\\partial(\\\\partial\\\\xi/\\\\partial{t})} \\\\right) \\\\- \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial{x}}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial{L_0}}{\\\\partial(\\\\partial\\\\xi/\\\\partial{x})} \\\\right) \\\\- \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial{y}}\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial{L_0}}{\\\\partial(\\\\partial\\\\xi/\\\\partial{y})} \\\\right) = 0. Now \\\\xi is first taken equal to \\\\varphi and then to \\\\zeta. As a result, the evolution equations for the wave motion become: :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\zeta}{\\\\partial t}\\\\, &\\\\+ abla \\\\cdot \\\\left( F\\\\, abla\\\\varphi \\\\right)\\\\, -\\\\, G\\\\, \\\\varphi\\\\, =\\\\, 0 \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\varphi}{\\\\partial t}\\\\, &+\\\\, g\\\\, \\\\zeta\\\\, =\\\\, 0, \\\\end{align} with ‚àá the horizontal gradient operator: ‚àá ‚â°(‚àÇ/‚àÇx ‚àÇ/‚àÇy)T where T denotes the transpose. The next step is to choose the shape function f and to determine F and G. = Vertical shape function from Airy wave theory = Since the objective is the description of waves over mildly sloping beds, the shape function f(z) is chosen according to Airy wave theory. This is the linear theory of waves propagating in constant depth h. The form of the shape function is: :f = \\\\frac{\\\\cosh\\\\, \\\\bigl( k\\\\, (z+h) \\\\bigr)}{\\\\cosh\\\\, (k h)}, with k(x,y) now in general not a constant, but chosen to vary with x and y according to the local depth h(x,y) and the linear dispersion relation: :\\\\omega_0^2\\\\, =\\\\, g\\\\, k\\\\, \\\\tanh\\\\, (k h). Here \\\\omega_0 a constant angular frequency, chosen in accordance with the characteristics of the wave field under study. Consequently, the integrals F and G become: : \\\\begin{align} F &= \\\\int_h^0 f^2\\\\; \\\\text{d}z = \\\\frac{1}{g}\\\\, c_p\\\\, c_g \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\ G &= \\\\int_h^0 \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial{f}}{\\\\partial{z}} \\\\right)^2\\\\; \\\\text{d}z = \\\\frac{1}{g} \\\\left( \\\\omega_0^2\\\\, -\\\\, k^2\\\\, c_p\\\\, c_g \\\\right). \\\\end{align} The following time-dependent equations give the evolution of the free-surface elevation \\\\zeta(x,y,t) and free-surface potential \\\\phi(x,y,t): : \\\\begin{align} g\\\\, \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\zeta}{\\\\partial{t}} &\\\\+ abla\\\\cdot\\\\left( c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, abla \\\\varphi \\\\right) \\\\+ \\\\left( k^2\\\\, c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, -\\\\, \\\\omega_0^2 \\\\right)\\\\, \\\\varphi = 0, \\\\ \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\varphi}{\\\\partial{t}} &\\\\+ g \\\\zeta = 0, \\\\quad \\\\text{with} \\\\quad \\\\omega_0^2\\\\, =\\\\, g\\\\, k\\\\, \\\\tanh\\\\, (kh). \\\\end{align} From the two evolution equations, one of the variables \\\\varphi or \\\\zeta can be eliminated, to obtain the time-dependent form of the mild-slope equation: : -\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2\\\\zeta}{\\\\partial{t^2}} \\\\+ abla\\\\cdot\\\\left( c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, abla \\\\zeta \\\\right) \\\\+ \\\\left( k^2\\\\, c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, -\\\\, \\\\omega_0^2 \\\\right)\\\\, \\\\zeta = 0, and the corresponding equation for the free-surface potential is identical, with \\\\zeta replaced by \\\\varphi. The time-dependent mild-slope equation can be used to model waves in a narrow band of frequencies around \\\\omega_0. = Monochromatic waves = Consider monochromatic waves with complex amplitude \\\\eta(x,y) and angular frequency \\\\omega: :\\\\zeta(x,y,t)\\\\, =\\\\, \\\\Re\\\\left{ \\\\eta(x,y)\\\\; \\\\text{e}^{-i\\\\, \\\\omega\\\\, t} \\\\right}, with \\\\omega and \\\\omega_0 chosen equal to each other, \\\\omega=\\\\omega_0. Using this in the time-dependent form of the mild-slope equation, recovers the classical mild-slope equation for time-harmonic wave motion: : abla \\\\cdot \\\\left( c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, abla \\\\eta \\\\right)\\\\, +\\\\, k^2\\\\, c_p\\\\, c_g\\\\, \\\\eta\\\\, =\\\\, 0.  Applicability and validity of the mild-slope equation  The standard mild slope equation, without extra terms for bed slope and bed curvature, provides accurate results for the wave field over bed slopes ranging from 0 to about 1/3. However, some subtle aspects, like the amplitude of reflected waves, can be completely wrong, even for slopes going to zero. This mathematical curiosity has little practical importance in general since this reflection becomes vanishingly small for small bottom slopes.

Shantaram's 1934 film Amrit Manthan, which was also his film debut. It was the first film made in the newly established Prabhat Films studio, and made both in Hindi and Marathi. Mohan received acclaim for his role as role Rajguru and went on to establish himself as a noted villain of the time. Mohan later appeared as Emperor Jehangir in Sohrab Modi's Pukar, as Randhir Singh in Mehboob Khan's Humayun and as Seth Laxmidas, in Mehboob Khan's Roti. One of his last appearances was in Ramesh Saigal's 1948 film Shaheed. As Rai Bahadur Dwarka Nath, he played father to Ram, who was portrayed by Dilip Kumar.

The restaurants were famous in Times Square until the Prohibition era, beginning with their initial restaurant in 1890. The brothers were born in County Leitrim, Ireland, and came to the United States in 1888. The last Shanley's closed in 1925. The first and last of the famous \\"lobster palaces\\" of Broadway was Shanley's. There were seven brothers in the clan and it was common jest in the early 1900s that whenever the Shanley's were about to open a new spot, they would send to Ireland for another brother. At one time there were four Shanley Restaurants operating concurrently. The head of the tribe was Tom Shanley. Tom and Barney Shanley opened a restaurant on Sixth Avenue, between 23rd and 24th Sts., then the center of the nite life in the city. The second restaurant was opened in 1896 on Broadway, between 29th and 30th St; and, thereafter, the Shanley Restaurants followed the northward tide of commerce and entertainment. In 1896, Oscar Hammerstein startled the town by opening The New York Theater on Broadway, between 44th and 45th St. Skeptics thought the impresario \\"crazy\\" for venturing above 42nd Street. The Shanley's followed suit, crossing the 42nd St.\\"deadline\\" to open a restaurant on the east side of Broadway and 43rd Street. This trail-blazing venture was the forerunner of the lobster palaces that were later to decorate the Gay White Way. Ornate chandeliers and other elegant trappings made the new Shanley's the talk of the town. The Empire Room on the main floor dazzled diners with its gilt, mahogany and mirrors. The Ladies Restaurant on the second floor was resplendent in red and green, done in the style of Louis XVI. On the third floor was the Roman Court, a sumptuous banquet room with two balconies and a ceiling 30 feet high. Mythological Roman subjects were presented in bas-relief at one end of the room. Shanley's \\"uptown\\" spot became a rendezvous for stage and political celebrities.John and Ethel Barrymore, Teddy Roosevelt, Harry Houdini, David Belasco, Richard Mansfield, \\"Diamond Jim\\" Brady and Lillian Russell might be seen at adjacent tables. When Adolph Ochs built the Times Tower on Longacre Square (later Times Square) in 1904, Shanley's became the social headquarters for his editorial and executive staff. When the Putnam Palace opened on the West Side of Broadway, (where the Paramount Theater now stands) the Shanley's rented space on the 43rd side and opened the most ambitious cafe, at a cost of $350,000. Opening nite, July 14, 1910, the crowd that occupied every one of the 315 tables, included: former D.A. William Travers Jerome (who prosecuted Harry Thaw), Tammany leader Charley Murphy, the Sullivans; actors Sam Bernard, Lew Fields, Joe Weber, Douglas Fairbanks. Among the ladies present, were: Louise Dresser, who later became famous in theater and films and Lillian Lorraine, described by Ziegfeld as the most beautiful woman in the world. Shanley's, indirectly, was a motivating factor in the creation of ASCAP, today, one of the most powerful unions in the entertainment field. Victor Herbert was dining at Shanley's, listening to the orchestra play a medley of his compositions, when the waiter handed him a staggering check. \\"You've charged me for every item on the menu, apparently, and I am paying the bill? But how much are you paying me for playing my compositions? The answer, of course, was \\"nothing.\\" With this, Herbert sued Patrick Shanley, for the illegal use of his compositions. The suit went all the way to the Supreme Court, where Oliver Wendell Holmes ruled in favor of Victor Herbert and as a result, ASCAP was founded. Chronology of establishments The Shanley Restaurants followed the journey of the theater, beginning on 23rd Street and finding their great success in Times Square, which was then called, \\"Longacre Square. The Shanley's followed the commerce and theater uptown, crossing the 42nd street barrier and was frequented largely by the theater and political crowd.

Toward the end of the 1920s the Orthodox Slavic speaking population was located in only two villages Herbel and K√´r√ßisht i Ep√´rm while in the 1930s the population decline of Orthodox Slavophones continued. In the post 1992 communist era, Macedonian sources have claimed that in the area of Maqellar√´ administrative unit there are several Macedonian villages.Macedonians in Albania p. 4. During the 2000s linguists Klaus Steinke and Xhelal Ylli seeking to corroborate villages cited in past literature as being Slavic speaking carried out fieldwork in villages of the area. In Herbel only 6 Orthodox Slavic speaking families made up of 3 larger households of around 20 individuals each remain. In K√´r√ßisht i Ep√´rm the village contains 200 inhabitants and 45 households, of which 6 are Orthodox families with a total of 17 individuals.

Albanian is also used in family settings especially by younger generations who have limited knowledge of Macedonian due to Albanian school influences and the demographic decline of the Slavic speaking population in the village. Linguists Steinke and Ylli also noted that unlike the Gollobord√´ region, the villages of the Maqellar√´ administrative unit area do not have any Muslim Slavic speaking inhabitants, and the village of Katund i Vog√´l (Obok) no longer has any Slavic Christians left and is inhabited only by Albanians. \\"K√´r√ßishti i Ep√´rm...

Man bezeichnet sie als Makedonisch und verwendet sie ausschlie√ülich innerhaib der Familie.

This slab was seized by Sikhs from Delhi, during an attack against the Mughal armies, and brought back to Amritsar as a symbol that the Mughal Empire will end with the removal of their coronation stone. History Golden Temple illuminated on Guru Nanak Dev Gurpurab During the reign of the Muslim Mughal Emperors, The Golden Temple was damaged many times, but each time it was rebuilt by the Sikhs. Sardars of the 12 Sikh Misls decided that some of the Khalsa leaders must be housed inside it for its protection against their enemies. According to Fenech and McLeod, during the 18th century, Sikh misl chiefs and rich communities built over 70 such Bungas of different shapes and forms around the Golden Temple to watch the area, house soldiers and defend the temple. Such Bungas were also built near major Sikh shrines elsewhere on the Indian subcontinent in the 18th-century. In the 19th century, these served defensive purposes, provided accommodation for Sikh pilgrims and some served as centers of learning. Most of the Bungas were demolished during and after the British colonial era, often to improve the facilities for growing number of pilgrims in the 20th-century. The Ramgarhia Bunga is single surviving example of the Bunga-related historic infrastructure in Amritsar, along with Akal Takht which originally was built as the Akal Bunga on the other side of holy tank. Ramgarhia misl chief Jassa Singh Ramgarhia had conquered territory as far afield as Delhi, where he removed the slab from the Takht-e-Taus on which the Mughal coronation ceremonies were held. He brought the slab to Amritsar and placed it in the Ramgarhia Bunga where it still lies. Architecture Bunga Ramgarhia Ramgarhia Bunga consists of three flat-roofed ranges, each of two principal storeys, arranged round three sides of a courtyard and is constructed almost of small burnt bricks (Nanakshahi) set in lime and mud mortar. The colonnade and the triple arches are of red sandstone. The undersides of the vaults and all the walls were finished internally and externally with lime plaster and lime wash, much of it decorative with arches. Lower levels are approached by two flights of steps, one from outside and the other from within the courtyard. Ramgarhia misl Ramgarhia misl chief Jassa Singh Ramgarhia was a brave Sikh leader. He had redesignedhttps://www.thesikhencyclopedia.com/architecture/ram-rauni a mud fortress Ram Rauni in 1748 about a mile from Golden Temple which was used to house and keep soldiers. The place was named so in honour of fourth Sikh Guru Shri Guru Ram Das Ji, who have founded the Amritsar city. The place was later known as Quila Ramgarh due to its fortification by Jassa Singh Ramgarhia. The Ramgarhia Misl derives its name from this place which literally means Custodians of the Castle of God.https://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060330/aplus.htm#1 The Quila Ramgarh has already lost its very existence and its location is adjacent to Gurudwara Sri Ramsar Sahib and Guru Ramdas Khalsa Senior Secondary School on Ramsar Road, Amritsar. Ramgarhia bunga remains a symbol of the Ramgarhia Sikh community's identity, their historic sacrifices and contribution to defending the Golden Temple over the centuries. Renovation The original domes on the minarets were damaged and then removed in 1903 because of an earthquake.

In 1925 the Deutsche Reichsbahn grouped them into their DRG Class 79.0.  History  The two locomotives were built in 1916 at the S√§chsischen Maschinenfabrik, formerly Hartmann. The undercarriage of the locomotives was unusual. Instead of an alternative proposal for a twelve- coupled locomotive with sideways-sliding G√∂lsdorf axles, as was realised a year later in the shape of the W√ºrttemberg K, the Saxon Railways decided on a proposal by their head of the engineering department, Lindner, for a design that was unique in Germany: the Saxon XV HTV was given two, fixed, six-coupled drives. This was mainly because they had doubts about the suitability of the G√∂lsdorf system for twelve-couplers. The outside axles were designed as Klien- Lindner axles and could be slid sideways by about 37 mm from their centre position. The design of these axles required them to be fixed into an outside frame. In the centre of the locomotive was a double cylinder on each side, each with a high-pressure cylinder for the rear and a low-pressure cylinder for the front drive. This design with its low stress on the rails, low inherent resistance and simple weight compensation was promising especially as it also avoided the use of cranked driving axles. Similar thoughts in the USA during the 1930s led to the development of duplex locomotives. Because the cylinders of adjacent axles also had 28 mm of side play, the locomotive could negotiate radii of as little as 170 m. Through the special design of the cylinders, the use of crank axles (Kropfachse) was avoided. Whilst this design enabled the steam lines between the high- and low-pressure cylinders to be extremely short, long admission and exhaust tubes were necessary. The XV HTV soon proved to be expensive to maintain, particularly with regard to the drives and the hollow axles; as a result no more were procured. Even the usual tendency of all compound engines to sway could not be eliminated by the Klien- Lindner configuration. Wear and tear on the wheel tyres changed the crank settings of the driving gear. That meant that the synchronisation of the drive had to be constantly adjusted, in order to ensure a balanced distribution of effort. Nevertheless, the engines were successful in practice. They had impressive riding qualities right up to their top speed and wear and tear on the wheel flanges was low. The Deutsche Reichsbahn took both locomotives over as 79 001 and 79 002, but retired them by 1932. The serial number 79 001 was allocated from 1938 to 1947 to BLE No. 44 of the former Brunswick State Railway Company and from 1951 it was given to the former French locomotive, 1-242.TA.602, which ended up in German hands after World War II.  Design features  The boiler barrel comprised 2 shells with a diameter of 1,450 mm. On the top were two steam domes which were connected by a pipe inside the boiler. Between steam dome and chimney was a sand box. The firebox was made of copper and position over the first axle of the rear drive. The smokebox superheater was of the Schmidt type. The locomotive frame comprised an inside frame of 28 mm thick plate, and an outside frame for the hollow axles of 20 mm thick plate. The four-cylinder compound cylinders were arranged horizontally on the outside and each drove its centre axle  See also  *Royal Saxon State Railways *List of Saxon locomotives and railbuses  Sources  * *  External links  * Photo Category:0-6-6-0 locomotives 15 HTV Category:S√§chsische Maschinenfabrik locomotives Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1916 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of Germany Category:CC h4vt locomotives Category:Duplex locomotives ","title":"Saxon XV HTV"},{"id":"20112439","text":"Qend√´r Tomin is a former municipality in the Dib√´r County, northeastern Albania.

It was the most important public work executed under the then newly established Ministry of Public Works. It was built during the reign of Ismail Pasha when he was Khedive of Egypt. It was commissioned by Bahgat Pasha, minister of public works, who designed it primarily to provide perennial irrigation to the Khedivial sugar estates in Middle Egypt. It supplied perennial irrigation to and flood irrigation to another . The discharge of the canal varied between 30 and 80 cubic metres per second in summer and between 500 and 900 cubic metres per second in flood. Having its head on the left bank of the Nile, in Assiut, it runs northwards for 60 kilometres and then divides in Dairut into two main branches; one branch is the Bahr Yussef Canal, while the other is the Ibrahimiyah Canal proper. This 350 kilometer long canal, which is undoubtedly one of the largest artificial canals in the world, used to take off from the Nile without any weirs or inlet works on the river (the water of the river entered it freely). Sir William Willcocks, the famous British civil engineer, would construct the Assiut Barrage later in 1901 to provide means for better control of its discharge. Although locks were constructed through its southern third, Ibrahimya Canal is not navigable after Dairut as it was designed for irrigation purposes only. The Ibrahimiya, except at few locations where it follows portions of ancient canals, flows parallel to the Nile, and does not have between itself and the river a distance of more than 4 to 5 kilometres.  Dairut Distribution Works At its 60th kilometer at Dairut, Ibrahimiya Canal begins distribution of its water. At this point, the canal widens into a kind of basin, along which six works of distribution are constructed. They are: # Inlet of the Sahelieh Canal composed of two arches, 3 metres wide each. # Inlet of the Dairoutieh Canal, composed of three arches, 3 metres wide each. # Inlet of Bahr Yussef (the main irrigation canal for Faiyum), composed of five arches, 3 metres wide each. Bahr Yussef usually gets one third of the entire water of the Ibrahimiya Canal. It irrigates west of Minya, Beni Suef and Faiyum provinces. # Distribution work for Ibrahimiyah itself, composed of seven arches, 3 metres each and a lock 8.5 metres wide for navigation. # A reservoir to carry back to the Nile the surplus water of the canal. This works consists of five openings, 3-metre wide each and an 8.5 metre wide lock for navigation. # An inlet of two arches, 3-meter wide each, for filling several basins on the left bank of Bahr Yussef canal, and at a level too high to be filled with Bahr Yussef itself.J. Barois, (1887). Irrigation in Egypt, Paris, 39 After Ibrahimiya leaves Dairut, a series of distribution works control water discharges along its route. They are : # Hafez Regulator: at kilometre 90 in Mallawi. The original regulator was abandoned and a new one was constructed in 1989 as part of the US funded Irrigation Improvements Project (IIP). Upstream of this regulator, on the left side is the intake for the Serry Canal, a major offshoot from Ibrahimiya, irrigating more than west of Minya. # Minya Regulator: at kilometre 120, in Minya. The old regulator (which is still used as a bridge) consists of three arches, 3 metres wide each. A new regulator 2 kilometers downstream of this old one was constructed in 1993 also as a part of the IIP project. # Matay Regulator: at kilometre 160. It also consists of three arches, 3 meters wide each. # Maghagha Regulator: at kilometre 188. Another structure with three arches, 3 metre wide each. It also has a weir. # Al Sharahnah Regulator: at kilometre 210. A 3-arch regulator and a siphon allowing drainage water to cross underneath the Ibrahimiya canal are found in this point. After it leaves Al Sharahnah, the canal continues for about 140 kilometers but by the time it reaches Al Ayat in Giza, it is no longer a major canal, but rather a small irrigation canal with a width of 5 metres at the bottom.

Types of irrelevant costs are:Accounting Tools: What is an irrelevant cost? *Sunk costs * Committed costs * Notional or Non cash costs (e.g depreciation and amortization)  Example  A construction firm is in the middle of constructing an office building, having spent $1 million on it so far. It requires an additional $0.5 million to complete construction. Because of a downturn in the real estate market, the finished building will not fetch its original intended price, and is expected to sell for only $1.2 million. If, in deciding whether or not to continue construction, the $1 million sunk cost were incorrectly included in the analysis, the firm may conclude that it should abandon the project because it would be spending $1.5 million for a return of $1.2 million. However, the $1 million is an irrelevant cost, and should be excluded. Continuing the construction actually involves spending $0.5 million for a return of $1.2 million, which makes it the correct course of action.

It was published in North America by Destineer, produced and designed by Gammick Entertainment, and developed by Spanish studio EnjoyUp. The game was released as a DSiWare title in Europe. Like its title suggests, players take the role of Little Red Riding Hood as she destroys zombies with a variety of high-powered firearms. Gameplay The game is a top-scrolling rail shooter where the player may move left and right into one of seven spaces, touching the character will cause them to crouch while using the stylus to aim. Players may choose to be either Little Red Riding Hood, who specializes in guns, or Momotar≈ç, who specializes in ninja stars, although the difference is merely aesthetic. The action of the game consists entirely of shooting and dodging incoming attacks with increasingly difficult obstacles as the game progresses. Plot The main characters of Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQThe game takes place in Storyland with areas representing a number of classic fairy tales, such as The Adventures of Pinocchio and the Three Little Pigs. Little Red Riding Hood and Momotar≈ç are the two playable characters. Little \\"READY TO ROCK\\" Riding Hood grew up in the forest, spending her time visiting her grandmother and hunting for food. She loves automatic firearms, citing \\"collecting weapons\\" as one of her hobbies. Momotar≈ç is Little Red Riding Hood's friend, who was born from a giant peach. He has had over one thousand and one adventures including fighting off demons, finding lost treasures, and repelling threats from the underworld. Little Red Riding Hood finds that something has gone wrong with Storyland soon after saving her grandmother from another wolf attack. Along with Momotar≈ç, she decides to fight through the invading armies of zombies to find the source of the plague and destroy it. Development Little Red Riding Hood's Zombie BBQ was Spanish developer EnjoyUp's second game. To promote the game, they collaborated with Destructoid to hold a dress up contest with a copy of the game and a signed promotional poster as prizes. The contest ended September 30, 2008. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN listed the game as number six in their feature \\"The Top 25 DS Games Under $20\\", being the first game on the list to have a sub-US$20 initial retail price. It was a nominee for Best Shooting Game by IGN in their 2008 video game awards. GameSpot was not as impressed, citing poor controls, slowdown and cheap hits. Nintendo Life said that while the game may be a simplistic shooter it offers plenty of depth.

Born in Fairbury, Nebraska, Lade began his baseball career when he was signed by the Cleveland Indians as an amateur free agent in 1941. He spent the 1941 season with Oklahoma City of the Texas League, where he had a 6-10 record and an earned run average (ERA) of 3.66. At the end of the 1941 season, he was traded to Savannah of the South Atlantic League for Hugh Klaerner. On July 8, 1942, while playing for the Shreveport Sports of the Texas League, Lade pitched a no-hitter against San Antonio and won the game 1-0, with his solo home run providing the only run support for Shreveport. In August, he was purchased by the Chicago White Sox effective at the conclusion of the Texas League season, and was considered the top prospect of the four players acquired. After the 1942 season ended, Lade signed up for military service, and spent the next few years as a member of the United States Coast Guard. When he returned to the White Sox for the 1946 season, he was placed on the original major league roster, but instead began the season for Shreveport. On July 9, 1946, Lade's contract was purchased from the Chicago White Sox by the Chicago Cubs. In his time in the minors in 1946, he won 12 games and at one time pitched 32 consecutive scoreless innings. Lade made his major league debut on September 18, 1946 and played three games for the Cubs, losing two and finished with a 4.11 ERA. During the 1947 Chicago Cubs season, Lade had career highs in games started with 25, games played with 34, inning pitched with over 187, 11 wins, 10 losses, and a 3.94 ERA. By the end of the season, sportswriters were declaring the White Sox giving up Lade to be a \\"mistake\\" on their part. Over the next three season, Lade was primarily used as a spot starter. During the 1948 Chicago Cubs season, he played the first two months of the season before being optioned to Los Angeles to the disappointment of Ralph Kiner, who had hit five home runs off of Lade. He was later recalled and finished the season with the Cubs. He finished the season with a 4.02 ERA, five wins, and six losses in 19 games. The 1949 Chicago Cubs season saw Lade continue his role as a utility pitcher, pitching in 36 games, starting 13, and finishing 12, going 4-5 with an ERA of 5.00 in the process. Lade put up similar stats during the 1950 Chicago Cubs season. In 34 games, 12 of which he started, he won five, lost six, and had an ERA of 4.74. He was on the Cubs' roster through the winter preceding the 1951 season, but was cut May 15, 1951 to reduce the Cubs to a 25-man roster. This signified the end of his major league career, with Lade having played his last game on September 29, 1950. As a hitter, Lade was better than average for a pitcher, posting a .220 batting average (36-for-164) with 15 runs, 11 RBI and drawing 14 bases on balls. Defensively, he was a better than average fielding pitcher, recording a .988 fielding percentage, committing only two miscues in 171 total chances in 537.1 innings pitched, which was 27 points higher than the league average at his position. Lade died on May 18, 2000 in Lincoln, Nebraska, at the age of 79. He was cremated and is interred at the National Memorial Cemetery of Arizona located in Phoenix, Arizona.

He was an association footballer before he left home at sixteen to enrol as a naval engineering student at HMS Marlborough in Portsmouth. It was there he was converted into a rugby player. Taylor was a member of the HMS Marlborough rugby club when he made his debut for Wales against England in 1884 under the captaincy of Charlie Newman in the Home Nations Championship. Wales lost the game but Taylor would play in the remaining two games of the campaign against Scotland and Ireland. In 1884 Taylor was reselected for Wales, in a team that would host several past and future captains, including Arthur Gould, Tom Clapp, Frank Hancock and Newman. In the 1885 Championship Taylor made his first international score when he converted William Stadden's try, though as no points were given to conversions at the time he is recorded with no career score. In 1885, Taylor was spending much of his time in London, and when a group of Welshmen came together to form a club for London 'exiles', Taylor was among them.

Synonyms of test execution engine: * Test executive * Test manager * Test sequencer A test execution engine may appear in two forms: * Module of a test software suite (test bench) or an integrated development environment * Stand-alone application software  Concept  The test execution engine does not carry any information about the tested product. Only the test specification and the test data carries information about the tested product. The test specification is software. Test specification is sometimes referred to as test sequence, which consists of test steps. The test specification should be stored in the test repository in a text format (such as source code). Test data is sometimes generated by some test data generator tool. Test data can be stored in binary or text files. Test data should also be stored in the test repository together with the test specification. Test specification is selected, loaded and executed by the test execution engine similarly, as application software is selected, loaded and executed by operation systems. The test execution engine should not operate on the tested object directly, but through plug-in modules similarly as an application software accesses devices through drivers which are installed on the operation system. The difference between the concept of test execution engine and operation system is that the test execution engine monitors, presents and stores the status, results, time stamp, length and other information for every Test Step of a Test Sequence, but typically an operation system does not perform such profiling of a software execution. Reasons for using a test execution engine: * Test results are stored and can be viewed in a uniform way, independent of the type of the test * Easier to keep track of the changes * Easier to reuse components developed for testing  Functions  Main functions of a test execution engine: * Select a test type to execute. Selection can be automatic or manual. * Load the specification of the selected test type by opening a file from the local file system or downloading it from a Server, depending on where the test repository is stored. * Execute the test through the use of testing tools (SW test) or instruments (HW test), while showing the progress and accepting control from the operator (for example to Abort) * Present the outcome (such as Passed, Failed or Aborted) of test Steps and the complete Sequence to the operator * Store the Test Results in report files An advanced test execution engine may have additional functions, such as: * Store the test results in a Database * Load test result back from the Database * Present the test results as raw data. * Present the test results in a processed format. (Statistics) * Authenticate the operators. Advanced functions of the test execution engine maybe less important for software testing, but these advanced features could be essential when executing hardware/system tests.  Operations types  A test execution engine by executing a test specification, it may perform different types of operations on the product, such as: * Verification * Calibration * Programming ** Downloading firmware to the product's nonvolatile memory (Flash) ** Personalization: programming with unique parameters, like a serial number or a MAC address If the subject is a software, verification is the only possible operation.

Each germania () represented a single trade. The germanies are similar to the (also \\"brotherhoods\\", but in Castilian Spanish) of Castile, which were paramilitary law-enforcement militias. Similar to the hermandades, the Germanies at times took up arms to defend Valencia against raids from the Barbary pirates, but this privilege was revoked and the Germanies suppressed after they revolted against the royal government of King Charles I of Spain. Revolt The germanies began to take power in Valencia in 1519 after an outbreak of the plague, and the situation degenerated to open warfare between the Germanies and the Crown by 1520. The previous king, Ferdinand of Aragon, had granted permission for the Germanies to take up arms shortly before his death, but the Valencian nobles had mostly quashed this possibility, fearing the Germanies would gain political power if they could back their demands with force. King Charles I, however, issued an edict legalizing the Germanies to take up arms in 1519, which allowed the Germanies to strike back at the royal government after the new Viceroy of Valencia refused to seat elected representatives friendly to the Germanies. The Germanies were defeated after a year of warfare and another year of guerrilla raids from the countryside. Their leaders were executed as traitors and the Germanies were banned.

The story takes place during the slow-moving Northern Ireland peace process talks of 2004 and is written as the verbatim transcription of a covert British government recording. Johnson said his debut novel, published in 2005, was \\"a story without heroes set in a city where there are far too many.\\" Plot summary The story is narrated by a disagreeable misfit and heavy drinker called Fletcher Fee who works in a car wash at the Stormont government building. Some days after witnessing the violent abuse of an 18-year-old called Molly Duddy, Fee finds a listening device secreted in one of the government's black Mercedes cars which he is cleaning. He begins defining his character to the device, informing it and the reader that he is the product of a violent marriage between a Catholic father and a Protestant mother. Ultimately, Fee explains, he plans to break free from the shackles of a divided society. He develops a mild obsession with Molly, whom he refers to as Wee Blondie, as well as a plan to befriend her. During a protest, overzealous police shoot Fee's only friend, a Muslim colleague called Karim. The killing, which gets second place in a news media obsessed with Northern Ireland politics, spurs 25-year-old Fee towards a dangerous and violent form of revenge. His targets are politicians and paramilitaries from both traditions in Northern Ireland, Loyalist and Republican. The police, as well as both sides of the polarised community, are soon baffled as to who is carrying out these murders because they do not fit the traditional template of killing in Northern Ireland. After each murder, Fee returns to work and gets back into the car. There he describes what he has done and attempts to explain why he did it. After a savage and public double-killing which follows Fee's first sexually charged meeting with Molly, he flees as the police try and fail miserably to track him down. The final chapter contains an official government response denying that it or any of its agents were aware of Fee or of his activities before his final act. It also contains a denial, aimed at a suspicious Press, insisting that the government played no part in facilitating Fee's escape. Rumours from Stormont had suggested that unscrupulous powers had viewed his attacks as a way of getting both sides to refocus on the issue at hand, by way of a common enemy. However the reader is already aware that all of Fee's words are a transcription from secret government recordings in which the protagonist is codenamed Woundlicker. In a follow up police operation, a letter from Fee is found in Molly's house suggesting that she join him as he begins to make a new life for himself. Molly, like Fee, is nowhere to be found. Reaction Woundlicker, Johnson's debut novel, was well received by critics in Ireland, with the author being described by playwright Nell McCafferty as \\"The Irish Irvine Welsh\\" due to its colloquial and visceral style. However, Belfast minister David McIlveen called for it to be reviewed, saying \\"We need to ban this sort of filth...As far as I can see it's done for sensational purposes and shows an inability for the author to be constructive\\". Johnson responded that it was \\"authentic and reflects life in some parts of Belfast\\" Woundlicker is published by Belfast publishing house Blackstaff Press. Other work Alina, by Jason Johnson.

Rather unusual for such a locomotive were the smoke deflectors which were attached directly to the side tanks and extended as far as the front buffer beam. After the takeover of the BLE by the Deutsche Reichsbahn in 1938, the engine was given the running number 79 001, re-using a number previously given to a Saxon XV HTV that had been retired in 1933. The engine survived the Second World War and was sold to the (DEG), and sent to their (BSE) in 1947. It was transferred to the (FKE) in 1949, the (TWE) in 1960, and then returned to the FKE in 1966.

It initially emerged in 2008 from the UK's dubstep and grime scenes, exchanging their austere sound for a typically colorful or exuberant style featuring garish synthesizer tones, melodies, and effects. Other influences included American hip hop producers J Dilla and Madlib. Artists associated with the style include Rustie, Joker, Hudson Mohawke, Zomby, and Flying Lotus. Regional characteristics The \\"wet and unstable\\" sound of wonky is often achieved by producing unquantized beats and mid-range basses using pitch bending, mid-range synths, LFOs on lowpassing and highpassing, phasing, and delaying. Though wonky music is united by the tendency to use unstable mid-range synths, every wonky music scene has its own specific traits in sound. The American wonky \\"street bass\\" scene is influenced by broken beat and jazz music and the music itself has an organic feeling, while the Glasgow aquacrunk and Bristol purple sound scenes are influenced by the sound of crunk, chiptune, electro and instrumental grime/dubstep, respectively. Rustie performing in 2012. Aquacrunk was pioneered by Glasgow artist Rustie, and features slowed down, low-slung beats influenced by Southern hip-hop with electronic mutterings and morphing basslines. It is influenced as much by early Rephlex and Underground Resistance releases by crunk artists like Lil Jon or Young Buck. Purple sound emerged in Bristol in late 2008 out of the splintering dubstep scene and took inspiration from wonky, which it is sometimes considered a part of. It incorporates synth funk from the 1980s and G-funk production from the ‚Äô90s into dubstep, while also introducing many aspects of grime and chiptune (several prominent purple sound artists cite video game music as a large influence). Purple sound usually includes synths as a main component and avoids the bass 'wobble' and 2-step common in dubstep. The majority of purple sound tracks are instrumental.

The hospital has 227 beds and is affiliated with both the Wayne State University School of Medicine and the Michigan State University Medical School. The hospital provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to pediatric patients aged 0‚Äì21 throughout eastern Michigan and the Detroit area and is a part of the Detroit Medical Center. The hospital features the only freestanding pediatric Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center in the Detroit region, 1 of 3 in the state. It is an international provider of pediatric neurology, neurosurgery, cardiology, oncology and diagnostic services including Positron Emission Tomography and MRI.  History  Children's Hospital of Michigan was founded in 1886 with a financial gift from whisky entrepreneur Hiram Walker. It was further endowed in the 1930s with a one million dollar gift from U.S. Senator James Couzens.  Clinical specialties  The hospital offers a wide variety of clinical specialties, including: Autism, Burn Care, Cardiac Services, Cleft Palate/ Craniofacial Surgery, Communication Disorders, Critical Care, Dentistry/Oral Surgery, Dermatology, Ear, Nose and Throat, Emergency Care, Endocrinology, Gastroenterology, Genetic Disorders, Hematology and Oncology, Imaging Services, Immunology, Rheumatology and Allergy, Infectious Disease, Intensive Care, Myeleomeningocele Care, Neonatal/ Perinatal Medicine, Nephrology, Neurology, Neurosurgery, Ophthalmology, Orthopedics, Pediatric Surgery, Pharmacology/ Toxicology, Physical Medicine/ Rehabilitation, Reconstructive Surgery, Poison Control Center, Psychiatry/Psychology and Pulmonary Medicine. Children's is one of 10 centers nationally testing new drugs to treat spinal muscular atrophy, a rare degenerative problem that affects the spinal cord and nerves, resulting in muscle wasting and weakness. It houses the first pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratory of its kind in North America. Doctors at Children's Hospital performed the first successful advanced computer-assisted robot-enhanced surgical procedure at a children's hospital in the U.S. CHM cardiovascular surgeons performed the first pediatric heart transplant in Southeast Michigan. CHM is the only pediatric institution in the world with its own Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Center. Positron Emission Tomography is a type of nuclear medicine procedure that measures metabolic activity of the cells of body tissues. Children's Hospital performed the first successful pediatric bone marrow transplant in Michigan.  Controversy  In late 2019, the physician group, University Pediatrics announced that they were separating from the Wayne State University School of Medicine and instead joining the Central Michigan University. In retaliation, Wayne State announced that they were creating their own physician group, Wayne Pediatrics and gave doctors who taught medicine at the university 30 days to switch over their affiliation to Wayne Pediatrics or lose their teaching privileges. The group University Pediatrics has had an exclusive contract with the Detroit Medical Center and DMC's owner, Tenet Healthcare decided that doctors from Wayne Pediatrics would lose their affiliation with the hospital and doctors with Wayne Pediatrics would not be able to treat or admit patients at the hospital. In April, 2020 Wayne State officials announced that they were taking up legal action against Tenet Healthcare.  Certifications and rankings  Children's Hospital of Michigan in, 2008 received, American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) MAGNET Recognition designated for nursing excellence. Children's Hospital is the only children's hospital in Michigan with this award. Children's is in the Leapfrog Group's 2008 Top Hospital list for patient quality and safety.

It was then followed 2 years later by Devil's Crush, also for the Turbografx-16, which featured an occult theme with skulls, skeletons, and demons. A third game was later developed for the Super Famicom called Jaki Crush that contained a Japanese demon/ogre mythology theme, although the game was never released outside Japan. The series was revived in 2008 when Hudson Soft published a sequel/remake to Alien Crush called Alien Crush Returns for WiiWare.

Calculations with corner transfer matrices led Baxter to the exact solution of the hard hexagon model in 1980. Definition Consider an IRF (interaction-round-a-face) model, i.e. a square lattice model with a spin œÉi assigned to each site i and interactions limited to spins around a common face. Let the total energy be given by :E=\\\\sum_{all\\\\atop faces}\\\\epsilon\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{i},\\\\sigma_{j},\\\\sigma_{k},\\\\sigma_{l}\\\\right), where for each face the surrounding sites i, j, k and l are arranged as follows: Arrangement of sites around a face For a lattice with N sites, the partition function is :Z_{N}=\\\\sum_{all\\\\atop spins}\\\\prod_{all\\\\atop faces}w\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{i},\\\\sigma_{j},\\\\sigma_{k},\\\\sigma_{l}\\\\right), where the sum is over all possible spin configurations and w is the Boltzmann weight :w\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{i},\\\\sigma_{j},\\\\sigma_{k},\\\\sigma_{l}\\\\right)=\\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\epsilon\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{i},\\\\sigma_{j},\\\\sigma_{k},\\\\sigma_{l}\\\\right)/k_{B}T\\\\right). To simplify the notation, we use a ferromagnetic Ising-type lattice where each spin has the value +1 or ‚àí1, and the ground state is given by all spins up (i.e. the total energy is minimised when all spins on the lattice have the value +1). We also assume the lattice has 4-fold rotational symmetry (up to boundary conditions) and is reflection-invariant. These simplifying assumptions are not crucial, and extending the definition to the general case is relatively straightforward. Now consider the lattice quadrant shown below: Lattice quadrant with ¬Ωm(m+1) faces The outer boundary sites, marked by triangles, are assigned their ground state spins (+1 in this case). The sites marked by open circles form the inner boundaries of the quadrant; their associated spin sets are labelled {œÉ1,...,œÉm} and {œÉ'1,...,œÉ'm}, where œÉ1 = œÉ'1. There are 2m possible configurations for each inner boundary, so we define a 2m√ó2m matrix entry-wise by :A_{\\\\sigma\\\\sigma'}=\\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{1},\\\\sigma_{1}'\\\\right)\\\\sum_{interior\\\\atop spins}\\\\prod_{all\\\\atop faces}w\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{i},\\\\sigma_{j},\\\\sigma_{k},\\\\sigma_{l}\\\\right). The matrix A, then, is the corner transfer matrix for the given lattice quadrant. Since the outer boundary spins are fixed and the sum is over all interior spins, each entry of A is a function of the inner boundary spins. The Kronecker delta in the expression ensures that œÉ1 = œÉ'1, so by ordering the configurations appropriately we may cast A as a block diagonal matrix: :\\\\begin{array}{cccc} & & \\\\begin{array}{ccccc} \\\\sigma_{1}'=+1 & & & & \\\\sigma_{1}'=-1\\\\end{array}\\\\ A & = & \\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{ccccccc} & & & \\\\ & A_{+} & &  & & 0\\\\ & & & \\\\ \\\\- & \\\\- & \\\\- &  & \\\\- & \\\\- & -\\\\ & & & \\\\ & 0 & &  & & A_{-}\\\\ & & & \\\\end{array}\\\\right] & \\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\sigma_{1}=+1\\\\ \\\\sigma_{1}=-1\\\\end{array}\\\\end{array} Corner transfer matrices are related to the partition function in a simple way. In our simplified example, we construct the full lattice from four rotated copies of the lattice quadrant, where the inner boundary spin sets œÉ, œÉ', œÉ\\" and œÉ'\\" are allowed to differ: Full lattice with 2m(m+1) faces The partition function is then written in terms of the corner transfer matrix A as :Z_{N}=\\\\sum_{\\\\sigma,\\\\sigma',\\\\sigma,\\\\sigma'}A_{\\\\sigma\\\\sigma'}A_{\\\\sigma'\\\\sigma}A_{\\\\sigma\\\\sigma}A_{\\\\sigma\\\\sigma}=\\\\textrm{tr}A^{4}. Discussion =Recursion relation= A corner transfer matrix A2m (defined for an m√óm quadrant) may be expressed in terms of smaller corner transfer matrices A2m-1 and A2m-2 (defined for reduced (m-1)√ó(m-1) and (m-2)√ó(m-2) quadrants respectively). This recursion relation allows, in principle, the iterative calculation of the corner transfer matrix for any lattice quadrant of finite size. Like their row-to-row counterparts, corner transfer matrices may be factored into face transfer matrices, which correspond to adding a single face to the lattice. For the lattice quadrant given earlier, the face transfer matrices are of size 2m√ó2m and defined entry-wise by :\\\\left(U_{i}\\\\right)_{\\\\sigma\\\\sigma'}=\\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{1},\\\\sigma_{1}'\\\\right)\\\\cdots\\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{i-1},\\\\sigma_{i-1}'\\\\right)w\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{i},\\\\sigma_{i+1},\\\\sigma_{i}',\\\\sigma_{i-1}\\\\right)\\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{i+1},\\\\sigma_{i+1}'\\\\right)\\\\cdots\\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{m},\\\\sigma_{m}'\\\\right), where 2 ‚â§ i ‚â§ m+1. Near the outer boundary, specifically, we have :\\\\left(U_{m}\\\\right)_{\\\\sigma\\\\sigma'}=\\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{1},\\\\sigma_{1}'\\\\right)\\\\cdots\\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{m-1},\\\\sigma_{m-1}'\\\\right)w\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{m},+1,\\\\sigma_{m}',\\\\sigma_{m-1}\\\\right), :\\\\left(U_{m+1}\\\\right)_{\\\\sigma\\\\sigma'}=\\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{1},\\\\sigma_{1}'\\\\right)\\\\cdots\\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{m},\\\\sigma_{m}'\\\\right)w\\\\left(+1,+1,+1,\\\\sigma_{m}\\\\right). So the corner transfer matrix A factorises as :A=F_{2}\\\\cdots F_{m+1}, where :F_{j}=U_{m+1}\\\\cdots U_{j}. Graphically, this corresponds to: Graphical representation of factorisation We also require the 2m√ó2m matrices A* and A**, defined entry-wise by :\\\\left(A^{*}\\\\right)_{\\\\sigma\\\\sigma'}=\\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{1},\\\\sigma_{1}'\\\\right)A_{\\\\sigma_{2},\\\\ldots,\\\\sigma_{m}\\\\sigma_{2}',\\\\ldots,\\\\sigma_{m}'}, :\\\\left(A^{**}\\\\right)_{\\\\sigma\\\\sigma'}=\\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{1},\\\\sigma_{1}'\\\\right)\\\\delta\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{2},\\\\sigma_{2}'\\\\right)A_{\\\\sigma_{3},\\\\ldots,\\\\sigma_{m}\\\\sigma_{3}',\\\\ldots,\\\\sigma_{m}'}, where the A matrices whose entries appear on the RHS are of size 2m-1√ó2m-1 and 2m-2√ó2m-2 respectively. This is more clearly written as :A^{*}=I_{2}\\\\otimes A_{2^{m-1}}=\\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{cc} A & 0\\\\ 0 & A\\\\end{array}\\\\right], :A^{**}=I_{2}\\\\otimes I_{2}\\\\otimes A_{2^{m-2}}=\\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{cccc} A & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & A & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & A & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & A\\\\end{array}\\\\right]. Now from the definitions of A, A*, A**, Ui and Fj, we have :A^{*}=F_{3}\\\\cdots F_{m+1},A^{**}=F_{4}\\\\cdots F_{m+1} :\\\\Rightarrow A=F_{2}A^{*},A^{*}=F_{3}A^{**} :\\\\Rightarrow A=A^{*}\\\\left(A^{**}\\\\right)^{-1}U_{2}A^{*}, which gives the recursion relation for A2m in terms of A2m-1 and A2m-2. =Diagonal form= When using corner transfer matrices to perform calculations, it is both analytically and numerically convenient to work with their diagonal forms instead. To facilitate this, the recursion relation may be rewritten directly in terms of the diagonal forms and eigenvector matrices of A, A* and A**. Recalling that the lattice in our example is reflection-invariant, in the sense that :w\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{i},\\\\sigma_{j},\\\\sigma_{k},\\\\sigma_{l}\\\\right)=w\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{k},\\\\sigma_{j},\\\\sigma_{i},\\\\sigma_{l}\\\\right)=w\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{i},\\\\sigma_{l},\\\\sigma_{k},\\\\sigma_{j}\\\\right), we see that A is a symmetric matrix (i.e. it is diagonalisable by an orthogonal matrix). So we write :A=\\\\alpha_{m}PA_{d}P^{T}, where Ad is a diagonal matrix (normalised such that its numerically largest entry is 1), Œ±m is the largest eigenvalue of A, and PTP = I. Likewise for A* and A**, we have :A^{*}=\\\\alpha_{m-1}P^{*}A_{d}^{*}\\\\left(P^{*}\\\\right)^{T}, :A^{**}=\\\\alpha_{m-2}P^{**}A_{d}^{**}\\\\left(P^{**}\\\\right)^{T}, where Ad*, Ad**, P* and P** are defined in an analogous fashion to A* and A**, i.e. in terms of the smaller (normalised) diagonal forms and (orthogonal) eigenvector matrices of A2m-1 and A2m-2. By substituting these diagonalisations into the recursion relation, we obtain :A_{t}=\\\\kappa RA_{d}R^{T}, where :\\\\kappa=\\\\frac{\\\\alpha_{m}\\\\alpha_{m-2}}{\\\\alpha_{m-1}^{2}}, :R=\\\\left(P^{*}\\\\right)^{T}P, :A_{t}=A_{d}^{*}\\\\left(R^{*}\\\\right)^{T}\\\\left(A_{d}^{**}\\\\right)^{-1}U_{2}R^{*}A_{d}^{*}. Now At is also symmetric, and may be calculated if Ad*, Ad** and R* are known; diagonalising At then yields its normalised diagonal form Ad, its largest eigenvalue Œ∫, and its orthogonal eigenvector matrix R. Applications =Spin expectation value= Corner transfer matrices (or their diagonal forms) may be used to calculate quantities such as the spin expectation value at a particular site deep inside the lattice. For the full lattice given earlier, the spin expectation value at the central site is given by :\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\sigma_{1}\\\\right\\\\rangle =\\\\frac{1}{Z_{N}}\\\\sum_{all\\\\atop spins}\\\\sigma_{1}\\\\prod_{all\\\\atop faces}w\\\\left(\\\\sigma_{i},\\\\sigma_{j},\\\\sigma_{k},\\\\sigma_{l}\\\\right). With the configurations ordered such that A is block diagonal as before, we may define a 2m√ó2m diagonal matrix :S=\\\\left[\\\\begin{array}{cc} I & 0\\\\ 0 & -I\\\\end{array}\\\\right], such that :\\\\left\\\\langle \\\\sigma_{1}\\\\right\\\\rangle =\\\\frac{\\\\textrm{tr}SA^{4}}{\\\\textrm{tr}A^{4}}=\\\\frac{\\\\textrm{tr}\\\\alpha_{m}^{4}PSA^{4}P^{T}}{\\\\textrm{tr}\\\\alpha_{m}^{4}PA^{4}P^{T}}=\\\\frac{\\\\textrm{tr}SA_{d}^{4}}{\\\\textrm{tr}A_{d}^{4}}. =Partition function per site= Another important quantity for lattice models is the partition function per site, evaluated in the thermodynamic limit and written as :\\\\kappa=\\\\lim_{N\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}\\\\left(Z_{N}\\\\right)^{1/N}. In our example, this reduces to :\\\\kappa=\\\\lim_{N\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty}\\\\left(\\\\alpha_{m}^{4}\\\\textrm{tr}A_{d}^{4}\\\\right)^{1/N}\\\\sim\\\\alpha_{m}^{4/N}, since tr Ad4 is a convergent sum as m ‚Üí ‚àû and Ad becomes infinite-dimensional. Furthermore, the number of faces 2m(m+1) approaches the number of sites N in the thermodynamic limit, so we have :\\\\alpha_{m}\\\\sim\\\\kappa^{m\\\\left(m+1\\\\right)/2}, which is consistent with the earlier equation giving Œ∫ as the largest eigenvalue for At. In other words, the partition function per site is given exactly by the diagonalised recursion relation for corner transfer matrices in the thermodynamic limit; this allows Œ∫ to be approximated via the iterative process of calculating Ad for a large lattice. The matrices involved grow exponentially in size, however, and in actual numerical calculations they must be truncated at each step. One way of doing this is to keep the n largest eigenvalues at each step, for some fixed n. In most cases, the sequence of approximations obtained by taking n = 1,2,3,... converges rapidly, and to the exact value (for an exactly solvable model).

Ren is exemplified by a normal adult's protective feelings for children. It is considered the outward expression of Confucian ideals. Yan Hui, one of the Four Sages, once asked his master to describe the rules of ren. Confucius replied, \\"One should see nothing improper, hear nothing improper, say nothing improper, do nothing improper.\\"Analects 12:1 Confucius also defined ren in the following way: \\"wishing to be established himself, seeks also to establish others; wishing to be enlarged himself, he seeks also to enlarge others.\\"Analects 6:30 http://ctext.org/analects/yong-ye/zh?en=on Confucius also said, \\"Ren is not far off; he who seeks it has already found it.\\" Ren is close to man and never leaves him.(Do-Dinh 107) Gang Xu more specifically defined ren as \\"empathy\\", as elaborated by Confucius that \\"So, a man of Ren helps others become established if he desires to establish himself, and helps others reach their goals if he desires to reach his. Being able to make analogies between his own situations and those of others around him could be called the approach to Ren.\\"  Interpretation of the Chinese character  The single logogram for ren is a composite of two distinct common hanzi, ‰∫∫ (man, a man, a person) and ‰∫å (two), with ‰∫∫ assuming its common form inside another character, to which various interpretations have been assigned. One often hears that ren means \\"how two people should treat one another\\". While such folk etymologies are common in discussions of Chinese characters, they are often misleading. In the case of ren - usually translated as \\"benevolence\\" or \\"humaneness\\" - Humaneness is Human-ness, the essence of being human. For Confucius the interaction of completely dependent infant and caring parent is the most emotionally charged human interaction, \\"To love a thing means wanting it to live...\\".Analects XII.10 The Way of humaneness is human interaction and through shared experience knowing one's family. \\"Fan Chi asked about humaneness. The Master said it is loving people. Fan Chi asked about wisdom. The Master said it is knowing people\\".Analects XII.22 In other words, human love and interaction is the source of humaneness, the source of the human self. Another common interpretation of the graphical elements is Man or a man connecting Heaven and Earth. ‰∫∫+‰∫å=‰ªÅ (R√©n) man on left two on right, the relationship between two human beings, means humanity, benevolence, seed. Originally the character was just written as‰∏®‰∫å representing yin yang, the vertical line is yang (male, penis, heaven, odd numbers), the two horizontal lines are yin (female, vagina, earth, even numbers), ‰ªÅ is the seed and core of everything. The character ‰∫∫ (man, r√©n) and ‰ªÅ have the same pronunciation. When a human is unable to be humane, he or she does not qualify to be a human but an animal. But when a human is able to be humane, he or she qualifies to be a human. For example, when Buddhism was first introduced to China in the Han Dynasty the Chinese people translated the Buddha's name into \\"able to be human\\" or someone with \\"ability and humanity\\" (ËÉΩ‰∫∫ÔºåËÉΩ‰ªÅ) because Confucius's teachings and Buddha's teachings are \\"one to two, two to one.\\" Pre-imperial epigraphic sources testify to alternative writings of the same character: Âøé (given as a variant of ‰ªÅ in the Shuowen dictionary), Ë∫´ with ÂøÉ below, and the latter compound with ‰∫∫ on the right.Behr, Wolfgang. \\"In the Interstices of Representation: Ludic Writing and the Locus of Polysemy in the Chinese Sign\\". The traditional notion about the evolution of character r√©n however is challenged by archaeological discoveries in the past decades. In 1977, a character r√©n is identified in the inscription of bronze vessel Zhongshan Wang Ding, consisting of two characters Â∞∏(dead body) and ‰∫å (two); the vessel dates back to 314 B.C. In 1981, an earlier bronze vessel is unearthed, dating back to around 850 B.C. On this vessel, the earliest character r√©n is found again consisting of Â∞∏(dead body) and ‰∫å (two), and character r√©n is used exchangeable withÂ∞∏(dead body). Together earliest characters r√©n is associated with the notion of death. Principles of li, ren, and yi The principle of ren is related to the concepts of li and yi. Li is often translated as \\"ritual\\" while yi is often translated as \\"righteousness\\". These three interrelated terms deal with agency as Confucians conceive it. Li is the action which has been deemed appropriate by society, yi is the action that is indeed correct, while ren deals with the relationship between the agent and object of the action. Often li and yi are the same; however, that is not always the case. Li is the outward expression of Confucian ideals, while ren is both the inward and outward expressions of those same ideals. According to Hopfe and Woodward: \\"Basically, li seems to mean 'the course of life as it is intended to go'. Li also has religious and social connotations. When a society lives by li, it moves smoothly: men and women respect their elders and superiors; the proper rituals and ceremonies are performed; everything and everyone is in its proper place.\\"(Hopfe 180-181)  Nature of ren  =Traditional views= Ren relies heavily on the relationships between two people, but at the same time encompasses much more than that. It represents an inner development towards an altruistic goal, while simultaneously realizing that one is never alone, and that everyone has these relationships to fall back on, being a member of a family, the state, and the world.(Chi-Yun 34) Ren is not a concept that is learned; it is innate, that is to say, everyone is born with the sense of ren. Confucius believed that the key to long-lasting integrity was to constantly think, since the world is continually changing at a rapid pace. There have been a variety of definitions for the term ren. Ren has been translated as \\"benevolence\\", \\"perfect virtue\\", \\"goodness\\" or even \\"human-heartedness\\".(Hopfe 181) When asked, Confucius defined it by the ordinary Chinese word for love, ai, saying that it meant to \\"love others\\".(Dubs 1) Ren also has a political dimension. Confucianism says that if the ruler lacks ren, it will be difficult for his subjects to behave humanely. Ren is the basis of Confucian political theory; the ruler is exhorted to refrain from acting inhumanely towards his subjects. An inhumane ruler runs the risk of losing the Mandate of Heaven or, in other words, the right to rule. A ruler lacking such a mandate need not be obeyed, but a ruler who reigns humanely and takes care of the people is to be obeyed, for the benevolence of his dominion shows that he has been mandated by heaven. Confucius himself had little to say on the active will of the people, though he believed the ruler should definitely pay attention to the wants and needs of the people and take good care of them. Mencius, however, did state that the people's opinion on certain weighty matters should be polled. Ren also includes traits that are a part of being righteous, such as hsin, meaning to make one's words complement one's actions; li, which means to properly participate in everyday rituals; ching, or \\"seriousness\\"; and yi, which means right action. When all these qualities are present, then one can truly be identified as a junzi (ÂêõÂ≠ê), or \\"superior man,\\" which means a morally superior human being. Confucians basically held the view that government should be run by junzi who concentrate solely on the welfare of the people they govern. =Hypotheses regarding origins and the role of Confucius= Gang Xu analyzes various remarks on ren by Confucius, examines the earliest Chinese characters ren from archaeological discoveries in the past decades, and reviews the literature that has been rediscovered by scholars in the field. He concludes that ren originally denotes a practice of human sacrifice and martyrdom where a man of respectable social standing sacrificed himself to defend the societal expectations or code of honor, often in a time of social crisis, to honor the heaven and the earth. Confucius transformed the notion ren to \\"empathy\\" and rejected insignificant sacrifice in civil services and politics. He used the concept as the pillar of his value system and built a set of standard that is defined, in today‚Äôs terms, as professionalism.

It was based on a shorter U.S. Army training film, Our Job in Japan, that had been produced in 1945‚Äì1946 for the soldiers occupying Japan after World War II. Both films dealt with Japanese culture and the origins of the war. Following the war, Peter Rathvon at RKO, who had seen Our Job in Japan during his own military service, decided to produce a commercial version of the film. He hired the original writer and editor to work on the new project. Theodor S. Geisel, better known by his pen name Dr. Seuss, co-authored Design for Death with his wife Helen Palmer Geisel. Elmo Williams was the editor for both films. Subsequently, Sid Rogell replaced Rathvon, and became the film's producer. The film was given wide release in January 1948; a review in Daily Variety characterized it as \\"a documentary of fabulous proportions ... one of the most interesting screen presentations of the year\\".. Secondary reference; primary reference hasn't yet been confirmed. Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, was not complimentary; he wrote that the film \\"makes the general point that too much control by a few people is a dangerous ‚Äì a 'racketeering' ‚Äì thing and that another world war can be prevented only by the development of responsible, representative governments throughout the world. That is a valid message, but the weakness with which it is put forth in a melange of faked and factual pictures and in a ponderous narration does not render it very forceful.\\" In his memoir, Elmo Williams maintains that he and Geisel created Design for Death nearly in its entirety, and that the credits for Fleischer and Warth were nominal ones. Rogell, Fleischer, and Warth received the Academy Awards for the film. Copies of Design for Death are apparently rare. Geisel thought that they had all been destroyed. However, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences sponsored a screening in October 2005, and parts of the film were included in the documentary The Political Dr. Seuss. Some materials related to Design for Death, including its script, are in an archive of Geisel's papers at the University of California, San Diego.

History The Union was born in the late 19th century, when a group of tax clerks met together to fight for higher pay, higher status and better conditions. At that time clerks were hired by surveyors of taxes, they were usually employed on a temporary basis, paid low wages and denied sick leave, holidays or promotion. Clerks who asked for better conditions were branded as agitators and sacked. So it took courage when a group of clerks met on 8 January 1892 and agreed a draft constitution to set up the Association of Tax Clerks another of the Federation's parent unions.IRSF 1936‚Äì1986: A Jubilee Celebration, at Congress House on 28 October 1986.

In 1938, the Inland Revenue Minor Establishments' Association joined the union. The union initially operated on a federal basis but, in 1939-40, it became a single organisation. These changes took place under the leadership of William Thomas Seddon. At the 1986 Jubilee Celebration, the IRSF was described as a modern efficient organisation, with a high profile in the trade union movement, with a membership of 55,000. In 1996, the IRSF merged with the National Union of Civil and Public Servants to form the Public Services, Tax and Commerce Union. Only two people held presidency of the union twice, those being G B Walker and William Robert Roy Skinner. The first female president of the Federation was Winifred Mary Kidd in 1956.

He was the official originator of the danz√≥n, and the founder of the Orquesta Fa√≠lde. Fa√≠lde's father was a Galician immigrant, and his mother a parda (dark mulata).The phrase used on his birth registration for his mother was \\"la parda libre Justa P√©rez\\". Failde, Osvalde Castillo 1964. Miguel Failde: cr√©ador musical del Danz√≥n. Consejo Nacional de Cultura, La Habana. p39 He was first taught music by his father, who was a trombone player, and at ten played cornet in the Banda de Bomberos (firemen) de Matanzas. Later he learnt harmony and composition under a French tutor, Federico Peclier. He also learnt the viola and double bass. Fa√≠lde was one of many musicians who actively conspired against the Spanish colonial rule; his life included the time of the Cuban War of Independence.Orovio, Helio 1981. Diccionario de la m√∫sica cubana. La Habana. p138An interesting account of Fa√≠lde is given in Chasteen, John Charles. 2004. National rhythms, African roots: The deep history of Latin American popular dance. Alberquerque N.M. Chapter 5: Fa√≠lde's Orchestra (Havana) p71 et seq. His orchestra was highly successful, though his major achievements were the creation of the danz√≥n and the compositions he wrote, many of which have been adapted since for other rhythms. The danz√≥n was, in his own words, a development of the danza, and that was the child of the contradanza. \\"De la danza al danz√≥n hab√≠a un simple paso.\\" (from the danza to the danz√≥n is a simple step)Failde, Osvalde Castillo 1964. Miguel Failde: cr√©ador musical del Danz√≥n. La Habana. Actually, it was not quite such a simple step. For a start, the danz√≥n was a much slower dance than both the contradanza and the danza; and it allowed for pauses between the different sections of a number. Both these features were welcomed in the tropical climate of Cuba. Perhaps even more significantly, the danz√≥n was a couple dance, though not a moving one like the waltz. The contradanza and danza were both sequence dances involving the whole dance-floor, as were all ballroom dances before the waltz. The habanera was the established favourite before the danz√≥n came on the scene. It was also a slow dance, and a descendant of the contradanza. The habanera had the advantage of being a sung genre, which the danz√≥n was not until much later. Both genres made use of syncopated creole rhythms; in the danz√≥n it is the cinquillo. In retrospect it is often difficult to see why one genre is preferred to another; the quality of compositions and the orchestras which choose to play it must have some influence. Did Fa√≠lde really invent the danz√≥n? The doubt is caused by the work of Manuel Saumell, who anticipated many of the rhythms which came later in the 19th century, and who may be the most important Cuban composer of that century.see Carpentier, Alejo 2001 [1945]. Music in Cuba. Minneapolis MN. p191 At length the Cuban government made Fa√≠lde the official inventor of the danz√≥n - in 1960, by which time the danz√≥n had become a relic, and its 'child', the chachach√°, had taken over.Failde, Osvalde Castillo 1964.

From 1931-33 he was employed by the Animal Breeding Institute at the University of Halle where he specialised in karakul breeding. On his return to South West Africa, he managed a karakul farm and later bought his own farm in 1937 at Dornfontein S√ºd. With the outbreak of the Second World War he and other Germans were interned in South Africa at a camp called Andalusia, now known as Jan Kempdorp. During his internment he studied botany with Prof. Otto Heinrich Volk, who had arranged classes for scholars in the camp. The tuition they received in the various sciences was of sufficient quality to be recognised after the war as being of university standard.Aluka biography As an ancillary activity Volk taught the students practical botany, assembling a herbarium from plants growing within the confines of the camp. The students also produced a booklet, a key to the genera of grasses, entitled \\"Bestimmungschl√ºssel f√ºr S√ºdwest-Afrikanische Grasgattungen\\", illustrated with engravings on pieces of wood and typeset with lead from toothpaste tubes. Some of the type and engravings are on display at the Swakopmund Museum. Immediately after his release, Giess was employed as plant collector at the University of Stellenbosch. His botanical training during the war had not been forgotten, and in 1953 he was offered the post of curator at the national herbarium in Windhoek. The nucleus of the new herbarium was a donation of 2 000 specimens from the initiator of the scheme, Prof Heinrich Walter of Hohenheim Technical University. Giess spent four years establishing the infrastructure of the herbarium, while continuing work on his farm. When the South West African Administration assumed management of the herbarium in 1957 they offered Giess the curatorship on a permanent basis, a post in which he served until his retirement in 1975. Giess resumed work under M.A.N. M√ºller, his successor. During his association with the herbarium he collected some 18 750 meticulously labelled specimens which are housed at BM, K, LUA, M, NBG, P, PRE and WIND. His field trips ranged over most of Namibia, visiting remote regions such as the Okavango River, Brandberg, L√ºderitz, Erongo Mountains and Kaokoveld. He was founding editor of the botanical journal Dinteria (1968-1991) and compiled a Preliminary Vegetation Map of South West Africa (1971) and Bibliography of South West African Botany (1989).

Only 27% of children under 5 sleep beneath insecticide-treated mosquito nets‚Äîone of the most effective ways to treat malaria‚Äîand only 34.8% of children under 5 years with fever receive treatment with any type of antimalarial medication. In 2014, high maternal mortality (1 in 22 women die in childbirth) led Save the Children to rate Mali the 3rd worst country to be a mother in 2014. Only 52% of births among women aged 15‚Äì19 are attended by a skilled health professional. Mali is dependent on international development organizations and foreign missionary groups for much of its health care. The total expenditure on health makes up only 7% of the national GDP and Mali has 0.1 hospital beds per 1,000 people. This health crisis is compounded by high levels of poverty‚Äîover 50% of the population lives on less than $1 a day (PPP)‚Äîand low levels of literacy, with a literacy rate of 39%. History Mali Health was founded in Sikoro, a slum community on the outskirts of Bamako, Mali by Caitlin Cohen, Lindsay Ryan and Erica Trauba, students at Brown University who had previously volunteered in Bamako. See above referenced names. Cohen, Ryan and Trauba believed that the role of an international development organization is to foster rather than replace local groups and government action. Similarly, Mouhammadoun (Modibo) Niang, Rokia Savan√© (vice-president of Coordination Des Associations Et ONG Feminines Du Mali), Siriki Coulibaly (adviser to Sikoro's chief and the town‚Äôs official representative to Mali Health) and numerous other leaders in Sikoro were frustrated by a history of failed projects, including a huge aid-agency water project that left the community without water, without the $30,000 they had contributed, and without many children, as many died due to iron contamination. Programs A graphic showing Mali Health's programs. =Action for Health= In 2008 the international NGO M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res (Doctors Without Borders) estimated that free malaria testing and treatment dramatically increased the number of people surviving the disease, and the World Health Organization's 2010 World Health Report concluded that direct payments are a major obstacle to health coverage in low income countries. However, user fees‚Äîin which patients pay money for services at a clinic or hospital‚Äîremain one of the largest barriers to health care for the poor in developing countries. Through its program Action for Health, Mali Health seeks to help families who are unable to afford health care for their children. Focusing on the first 1,000 days of life, when development is the most critical and the most vulnerable, Action for Health children receive subsidized primary care. Mali Health‚Äôs Community Health Workers visit enrolled families to monitor children's health and provide health education on issues such as malaria and malnutrition. After launching in 2010, the program grew quickly and now serves almost 2,000 children. The program has had success in increasing care-seeking and childhood survival rates: while the average Malian child visits a doctor once every four years, children in Action for Health average 2-3 visits per year. =Communications & Advocacy= The Communications & Advocacy Program aims to bring health education to the masses and incite relevant and productive discussions about health topics that directly affect communities. Mali Health employs a number of media to generate these discussions. Health Radio (included in Sustainia's 2014 list of 100 of the most sustainable solutions to community development) mobilizes community members around health and promotes health education and prevention. The show is broadcast by local announcers on Bamako‚Äôs most popular radio station, which serves one million listeners weekly.

Their music is a blend of classic 1980s era melodic rock and more modern power and symphonic metal influences. Keldian is a studio project, with band members Christer Andresen and Arild Aardalen composing, producing and performing the music with the aid of hired session musicians. Biography =Pre-Keldian 1988-2004= Andresen and Aardalen both grew up in the small town of Aurland, situated by the innermost arm of the Sognefjord in Norway. Andresen started playing guitar at the age of 8 and spent many of his early years in the hard rock band Madam Curie. Later on he joined forces with keyboardist Aardalen for the first time in the electronica-inspired stage project Protos Nemesis. Madam Curie and Protos Nemesis then fused into the short-lived Alien Love Gardeners, a classic rock band that released an EP titled Cuts Shape The Man in 2000. When the band broke up Andresen and Aardalen re-worked this EP as a studio exercise. They called the project Keld and renamed the EP Salvation For The Guilty, and this soon formed the basis for Keldian. Both the Salvation For The Guilty EP and earlier works by Protos Nemesis can be accessed through the \\"Hidden History\\" section on the official Keldian website. =Heaven's Gate and Journey of Souls 2005-2012= Andresen and Aardalen both figured in a 2005 cover band project named Top Guns, which covered rock and pop classics from the 1980s in concert. It seems that this project, in addition to the Salvation For The Guilty EP, was the impetus to create Keldian the same year. Andresen and Aardalen recorded original demos in the summer of 2005 and the following winter. These pre-production demos were then taken into production and embellished into their debut album Heaven's Gate. The album was produced and engineered by Aardalen, who had by then become a professional sound engineer. Heaven's Gate was released through American label Perris Records in early 2007. The album had worldwide distribution, including a unique Japanese edition that featured a bonus track, and enjoyed brisk sales despite being the debut record of an unknown band. Fan favourites on the album include the metal anthem \\"Sundancer\\" and the dark ballad \\"Redshift\\". The band's name is derived from the Old Norse word ¬´kelde¬ª, which means outspring, source or well in English. The band would be inspired by science-fiction, spirituality and philosophy for their lyrics, and the band's name was chosen to reflect that the roots of the soul are intimately linked to human kind's ultimate destiny among the stars. Keldian would loosely mean \\"someone who comes from the source\\".Keldian, Official Website, reported at Keldian.com; last accessed November 7, 2008. In May 2008, Keldian released their second album Journey of Souls, also through Perris Records, which received favourable reviews in many parts of the world. The band were praised for their original approach to the heavy metal genre, and also hailed as some of the genre's best lyricists, the latter exemplified by the war epic \\"Memento Mori\\". In a September 2008 radio interview with the Norwegian Broadcasting Company, Aardalen hinted that the third Keldian album was in the planning stages. The writing and production of this album would be significantly prolonged, as Keldian split from their record label and built their own studio to have maximum flexibility and control over their operations and finances.\\" ,\\" The rights to the first two Keldian albums have reverted to the band, allowing them to distribute their music and merchandise directly to fans through their official website and Facebook profile. Their own label is listed as Galactic Butterfly Music, and all their music is available in their own Keldian album store. =Outbound 2013-2015= On February 22, 2013, the band announced in a fan Q&A; on their website that the third Keldian album would be titled Outbound. On February 26, 2013, Keldian launched a funding campaign on Indiegogo, asking for contributions to the production of Outbound, which was set with a tentative September 2013 release in the case of a successful campaign. On March 4, with the campaign going well, Keldian revealed the cover artwork for Outbound. On March 6, 2013, the band's funding for the album was completed. On August 27, 2013, the band revealed the Outbound track listing and running order in the blog on their website. They also confirmed that the album was entering the final mixing stages. Outbound was released on October 31, 2013. =Darkness and Light (2015-Present)= During early 2015 Keldian announced that they had started production on recording their fourth album. It was also confirmed that J√∏rn Holen would reprise his role of recording drums. On August 14, 2016, the band announced their next album, 'Darkness and Light' on their website, which was planned for release in 2017. They released their first single from the album called \\"Blood Red Dawn\\" on October 5th, 2017. . On October 27th, 'Darkness and Light' was released digitally on all streaming services. The band comments on the name of the album \\"...Some of the lyrics had taken a darker emotional turn, and the yin and yang of the words led to the obvious album title: Darkness And Light.\\" Studio collaborators and the possibility of live shows Keldian's most frequent collaborator is drummer J√∏rn Steingrim Holen, who is best known for his work in the black metal outfits Windir and Vreid. He has performed on all of Keldian's albums. Journey of Souls featured several more session musicians, most prominently drummer Per Hillestad, who is known for his many years of studio and live work with Norwegian and international artists such as a-ha. There has been no Keldian live shows thus far, seemingly a consequence of the band's inception as a studio project. Andresen and Aardalen have stated in several interviews that their priority is to create a handful of albums before possibly turning their attention to touring.See Interview section at Keldian.com for several tidbits in various media. Aardalen has also commented that Keldian live shows are very unlikely, since the whole premise of Keldian \\"has always just been about me and Chris writing music together.\\" The only confirmed live material featuring Andresen and Aardalen consists of recordings made of their previous band Alien Love Gardeners, but these are extremely difficult to come by. Andresen has said that these recordings might be made available through the Keldian website at some point.

Harper offers services in a broad range of clinical areas, including cardiology, neurology, neurosurgery, organ transplant, plastic surgery, general surgery, bariatric (weight loss surgery) endocrinology and sleep disorders. History Established in 1863, Harper is among the oldest U.S. medical teaching institutions. Nursing became professionalized in the late 19th century, opening a new middle-class career for talented young women of all social backgrounds. The Harper Hospital School of Nursing, begun in 1884, was a national leader. Its graduates worked at the hospital and also in institutions, public health services, as private duty nurses, and volunteered for duty at military hospitals during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the two world wars. =World War I= Base Hospital No. 17 was organized at Harper Hospital in September 1916, and was mobilized on June 28, 1917. On July 3, 1917, the organization was transferred to Allentown, Pennsylvania, leaving there July 11, for New York City, where it embarked on the Mongolia and sailed July 13, 1917. It arrived at Southampton, England on July 24, by way of Plymouth, England, and at Le Havre, France on July 25, 1917. It remained at Le Havre until July 28, when it proceeded by rail to its final destination, Dijon, Department Cote D'or, in the advance section, arriving there July 29, 1917. Base Hospital No. 17 was the first American organization to arrive at that station, where it functioned as an independent hospital, until January 8, 1919. At Dijon the unit was assigned the Hospital St. Ignace (French Auxiliary Hospital No. 77), then operated by the French Army. The French had about 230 patients in the hospital when the unit arrived, the evacuation of which was not completed until August 18, 1917. It began receiving American patients on August 21, 1917, but the hospital was not officially turned over to the commanding officer until September 2, 1917. In June 1918, when the capacity of the hospital proved inadequate, a French seminary was taken over at Plombiers, France, about 3¬Ω miles from the main hospital, and was operated as an annex. The seminary was a large stone building, of 800-bed capacity, and was used largely for convalescent and minor surgical cases. Base Hospital No. 17 ceased to function January 8, 1919; the unit sailed from St. Nazaire on April 14, 1919, on the Princess Matoika, arriving at Newport News on April 27, 1919, and was demobilized at Camp Custer in Michigan on May 9, 1919. =First successful open heart surgery= Harper was the site of the world‚Äôs first successful open-heart operation, using a mechanical heart called the Dodrill-GMR developed by a General Motors engineer with Harper physicians, including Forest Dewey Dodrill. The mechanical blood- pumping machine allowed a human heart to be temporarily stopped and operated on while the machine maintained blood circulation in the patient's body. The successful first surgery occurred on 3 July 1952. =Recent= In 2004, Harper was the first to debut the Intraoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (iMRI) system in Michigan. Also in 2004, surgeons at Harper were the first to perform a kidney transplant on an HIV recipient. The hospital is now staffed by faculty of the Wayne State University School of Medicine. Rankings and accreditation Harper is in The Leapfrog Group‚Äôs 2008 Top Hospital list for patient quality and safety. The Leapfrog Group rankings are based on a survey conducted at 1,220 hospitals across the country. Harper University Hospital ranked above the national average in a survey compiled by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Federal Department of Health and Human Services. The list included data from 4,807 hospitals across the United States. Of those hospitals, only 38 were ranked above the national average. The results are meant to assist the public in assessing how well their area hospitals care for patients with specific types of medical conditions, including heart failure and heart attacks. Harper University Hospital has received full approval from the Surgical Review Corporation (SRC) and the American Society for Bariatric Surgery (ASBS) as a Bariatric Center of Excellence. This accreditation recognizes that Harper's bariatric program meets the patient care standards as set forth by the SRC and ASBS. =Hospital rating data from HealthGrades website= The HealthGrades website contains the clinical quality data for Harper University Hospital, as of 2017. For this rating section three different types of data from HealthGrades are presented: clinical quality ratings for twenty-nine inpatient conditions and procedures, thirteen patient safety indicators and the percentage of patients giving the hospital as a 9 or 10 (the two highest possible ratings). For inpatient conditions and procedures, there are three possible ratings: worse than expected, as expected, better than expected. For this hospital the data for this category is: *Worse than expected - 5 *As expected - 22 *Better than expected - 2 For patient safety indicators, there are the same three possible ratings. For this hospital safety indicators were rated as: *Worse than expected - 6 *As expected - 7 *Better than expected - 0 Percentage of patients rating this hospital as a 9 or 10 - 68% Percentage of patients who on average rank hospitals as a 9 or 10 - 69%HealthGrades website, https://www.healthgrades.com/hospital-directory/michigan-mi-detroit/harper- university-hospital-hgst68662386230104 .

FAB advocates for the District, directs marketing and outreach efforts, leads projects that contribute to sustainable development, and supports the development and capacity of its members. East Fourth Street is home to more than a dozen nonprofit cultural and community organizations, and was designated a Cultural District by Mayor Michael Bloomberg in January 2006. ‚ÄúDowntown's Theater Row\\" contains 10 theater companies, two dance companies, four visual arts organizations, and two non-profit community development organizations that have worked to create a plan for the long-term development of the cultural buildings on the block.http://fabnyc.org/ Background The East Village and Lower East Side of Manhattan has gone through remarkable change, particularly in the past three decades, when it began to experience a major real estate boom together with a huge influx of (mostly) young, single professionals attracted by the neighborhood's vibrant, diverse, creative character. The story of the neighborhood immediately surrounding East 4th Street between Second Avenue and the Bowery is unique in its history of artistic activity and grassroots activism. At the turn of the century, 66 East 4th Street, known as Turin Hall, was a focal point for the German immigrant community, and the first Yiddish theater in New York, in what became the Yiddish Theater District. Next door, at 64 E. 4th, was the Labor Lyceum, where early advocates for unionizing gathered and the International Ladies Garment Workers' Union was born. However, by the 1970s, the city was holding on to a large number of vacant properties, all acquired through eminent domain, with plans, developed by Robert Moses, to raze this \\"slum area\\" entirely. Neighborhood protest and the city's economic downturn halted everything other than the establishment of the 'Cooper Square Urban Renewal Area\\" and a hopeful plan for its development. The empty buildings sat there unused until La Mama, a small experimental theater and a founder of the Off-Off-Broadway movement which embraced artistic experimentation and social protest, led by the legendary Ellen Stewart, secured a 30-day lease from the city on a dilapidated property. The city's condition for the low rent was simply that La Mama would bear full responsibility for anything beyond the most basic maintenance of the building's shell. Gradually, other neighborhood arts groups secured similar 30-day leases in adjoining vacant buildings on the block. Fixing the properties up was all on their shoulders; bit by bit they repaired the roofs, kept the boilers operating, and improved their spaces. The 30 day leases stayed in effect for anywhere from 15 to 30 years. That ended in October 2005 when these same pioneering tenants became owners and the East 4th Street Cultural District became a reality. Usually, at this chapter in the gentrification story, the exodus begins. Artists and small arts groups are forced out due to wildly escalating rents. Manhattan communities once more prove inhospitable to the kind of diversity and cutting edge creativity these small groups represent. However, in a decision that surprised many, the city - with unanimous support at all levels of government - decided to sell six buildings and two vacant lots on East 4th Street between 2nd Avenue and the Bowery for $1 each to the artist tenants. Local leadership, which has been actively seeking to diversify the area's reliance on bars/clubs/restaurants as its prime source of economic activity, enthusiastically lent its support. The East 4th Street Cultural District was created. All the properties are restricted to non-profit cultural use in perpetuity; and, to date, $4.7 million in city and state monies have been allocated for their renovation. The East 4th Street Cultural District is only one block long, yet it encompasses 17 theaters and rehearsal studios, three film editing suites, and a large screening room. Each year it hosts over 200,000 people attending performances, workshops, and readings involving more than 1200 artists. Through the plan for the Cultural District, more than of vacant space on East 4th Street will be transformed into active cultural use. Community building FAB engages in a number of activities throughout the year that engage and strengthen the broader local community, such as the Load OUT!, a biannual ‚Äúreuse and repurposing riot‚Äù aimed at transforming one person‚Äôs trash into another person‚Äôs treasure. Beginning in 2013, leaders from organizations on the Fourth Arts Block began inviting local civic and arts groups to plan for the first- ever Lower East Side History Month (LESHM), which took place in May 2014 and is imagined as an annual event. With 33 local groups on the steering committee alone, LESHM debuted with scores of theater, music, visual arts, panel discussion and participatory events scheduled throughout the month, with everything from a Bowery film festival to a discussion about saxophonist Ornette Coleman and the Five Spot Caf√©. The month kicked off with ‚ÄúChalk LES,‚Äù a weekend when anyone and everyone was encouraged to write official and personal histories on sidewalks where notable events occurred.  Rod Rogers Dance Company and the DUO Multicultural Arts Center  Home to both the Rod Rogers Dance Company and the DUO Multicultural Arts Center (DMAC), 62 East 4th Street is a five-story building which stands between Second Avenue and the Bowery. By 2007 the building was severely deteriorated. The NYC Department of Design and Construction began the exterior renovation under the leadership of SUPERSTRUCTURES Engineers + Architects. The fa√ßade restoration of 62 East Fourth Street involved the recreation of the cornice and the balconies, replacement of the windows with historically appropriate materials, and analysis of paint in order to match the historic color. Now this once shabby fa√ßade is once again a point of pride for the block, and 62 East 4th Street has emerged with a fresh face as it continues its role as a vital contributor to the cultural life for which Greenwich Village remains known around the world. The restoration was substantially complete in 2011 and in 2012 received the prestigious Lucy G. Moses Preservation Award from the New York Landmarks Conservancy ‚Äì a rare distinction since the building is not an officially designated New York City Landmark.  Members  East 4th Street is home to more than a dozen arts and community groups, most of whom are pioneers of the block and have had long histories of racial and ethnic diversity, artistic ingenuity, and engaging low-income families: * Alpha Omega Theatrical Dance * Cooper Square Committee * Cooper Square Mutual Housing Association * Creative Time * Downtown Art * DUO Multi-Cultural Arts Center * East Village Art View * La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club * Millennium Film Workshop * New York Theatre Workshop * Paradise Factory * Rod Rodgers Dance Company * Rod Rodgers Dance School * Teatro Circulo * Teatro IATI * Works in Progress * WOW Cafe Theatre  References  External links * * Official blog Category:Culture of Manhattan Category:Arts centers in New York City ","title":"Fourth Arts Block"},{"id":"20113197","text":"The World Is Rich is a 1947 British documentary film directed by Paul Rotha.

Originally formed as a diverse artist enclave and bohemian work-live rental studios to financially support Andrew Carnegie's struggling concert hall, Sherman's home from the 1940s until 2010 allowed her to be part of a unique artistic community of neighbours. Her life's work consists of thousands of portrait images of celebrities, writers, poets, models, sports heroes, politicians, and many others (including many of the famed former tenants of Carnegie Hall), taken with a large format 8√ó10 camera. Life Sherman was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the oldest of eight children born to Nunzio and Pierna Rinaldo, immigrants who moved to the United States from Italy in 1910. Her father operated a photography studio in New Jersey where she learned the art at a young age. Editta was married in 1935 to Harold Sherman, a sound engineer and inventor, as well as her business partner. He died at the age of 50 years, after suffering blindness and diabetes, leaving Editta with five young children to bring up as a single mother. She and her husband were instrumental in raising charity funds for the American Theatre Wing during World War II by volunteering to take portraits of Hollywood stars to aid in the American war effort. Sherman was a muse of Andy Warhol who filmed her with filmmaker Paul Morrissey in the 1970s. She also appeared in the Abel Ferrara film Ms. 45 in 1981. She was a model as well as a photographer and was photographed by Francesco Scavullo and symbolized ageing gracefully at age 60 years old in his book \\"On Beauty\\" in the 1970s. A decade-long collaboration with her longtime friend and neighbour, William J. Cunningham, a fashion photographer for The New York Times, resulted in the Fashion Institute of Technology/Penguin Books 1978 publication of their book Facades, visually detailing 200 years of fashion and New York City architecture. In November 1967 Kodak Films sponsored a solo exhibit of Editta's celebrity portraits in a three-week public show at Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan. Sherman lived in Carnegie Hall until July 2010 and continued to work there until September 2010, having become an icon for renter's rights and affordable housing for the elderly in fighting eviction against the City of New York, the current owner of Carnegie Hall. All former residents have now relocated, and The Carnegie Hall Corporation plans to demolish the commercial and residential studios ‚Äî which in their 1950s Bohemian heyday numbered as many as 170 ‚Äî to create educational and rehearsal space for the hall. The $200 million project is to be completed in 2014. In a 2010 interview on \\"The Nate Berkus\\" show, Sherman said she wanted to live to be 100. Her wish was fulfilled on July 9, 2012, when she celebrated her 100th birthday. The very next year, on November 1, she died at 101.

It was first published in 1948, and was followed by a number of reprints and translations. The story revolves around mysterious \\"spook trains\\" that the Five hear about on a lonely moor. The book has been adapted to two television series. Plot Julian, Dick, George (Georgina by rights), Anne and Timmy (Timothy) the dog (the Famous Five) are planning to go camping in a moor with the absent-minded and insect-loving Mr Luffy, a master at Julian and brave Dick's school. When they arrive at camp they find that their camping site is close to a farm, and that several old train tracks run under the moors, some of them are unused. They soon make friends with a boy named Jock, who lives at the farm with his mother and stepfather, the farm owners. While exploring the moor, the Five find a railway yard and a tunnel that are apparently abandoned. A watchman called Wooden Leg Sam tells them that \\"Spook trains\\" travel along those tracks before chasing them away. The children visit the farm the next day and told Jock about the spook trains. Jock has a sissy of a boy called Cecil Dearlove inflicted on him who forces him to play \\"soldiers\\" with him all day. Jock retaliates by forcing him to play \\"Red Indians\\", scaring him in the process. In return, Jock is forced to stay in his room all day. His stepfather intended to cane him, but his mother wouldn't let him because \\"that would only make Jock hate his stepfather\\" They are surprised to find that most of the farm labourers are not working properly although Jock's stepfather, Mr Andrews, has supplied the farm with a lot of expensive equipment and vehicles. When Mr Andrews hears about the spook trains, he warns the children to stay away from the railway yard, and tries to prevent Jock from meeting the Five over the next few days. Julian and Dick secretly set off with Jock the next two nights to watch for the spook train, leaving the girls behind. They find that there is indeed a mysterious train coming from and back into the tunnel. The next day, George is furious when she finds that the boys had left them behind, and even takes out her anger on Anne: \\"If you weren't such a coward, if you hadn't been too frightened to come, I'd have been able to go too!\\" she says. She later apologises to them all for her behaviour, but that night sets a trap that doesn't work. Refusing to join the others the next day, she goes off with Timmy to try to find the spook trains by herself. She does find one, which enters a secret area behind a supposedly blocked-off section of the tunnel. Meanwhile, the boys explore the tunnel while Anne waits outside, but they are captured by some men led by Mr Andrews. Anne runs off to find Mr Luffy, but gets lost on her way. Eventually she does find him, along with some police officers that are helping him search for the missing Five. George, who had been hiding inside the train, rescues the boys, and realising that the train is used for smuggling, they try to find a way out of the tunnel. They are recaptured, but just in time, Anne arrives with Mr Luffy and the police to free them. After being rounded up by Timmy, the criminals are arrested, and the Famous Five return to the farm, while Jock is delighted at the adventure: \\"It was simply...smashing!\\" he says, borrowing Dick's favourite word.(in the Famous Five television series) Adaptations Five Go Off to Camp was adapted for an episode of the Famous Five television series in 1978, produced by Southern Television for ITV.

Additionally, private Instagram accounts of the students were accessed to provide additional evidence against students. These personal pictures of the two teenagers were described by the school as \\"indecent, scandalous, highly objectionable lascivious material which appeals to prurient interest.\\" Student's parents approached the Childs Rights Commission and Kerala High Court to move against school's action. The Kerala High Court deemed the action of the school management to be legal and rejected an interim order from the Child Rights Commission that suggested the students be allowed to attend classes.

However, the weather had abruptly become dark and rainy, and Dick and Anne are directed only with the vaguest ‚Äúar‚Äùs when they request directions, besides being confused by ringing bells whose meaning they cannot decipher. The two children take completely the wrong route, and upon seeing a light, run to meet a completely deaf old woman. Assuming it must be Blue Pond Farm-House, Dick and Anne go in but the old woman, called Mrs. Taggart, bluntly announces they must leave because her son would not accept either of them. However, once Dick manages to communicate Mrs. Taggart agrees to let Anne stay in a remote loft whilst Dick makes do with sleeping in the barn. During the night, Dick is awakened by a voice in the night who calls his name repeatedly. He knows the voice cannot be from one of the Five and cannot understand how he would know his name. Dick is given a message - ‚ÄúTwo Trees‚Äù. ‚ÄúGloomy Water‚Äù. ‚ÄúSaucy Jane‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd Maggie knows‚Äù - together with a piece of paper. When Dick wakes up, Mrs Taggart‚Äôs son is back and the old woman forgets Anne, so that Dick shouts for Anne. The two recognise it was not Blue Pond Farm-House, something confirmed when they meet a local boy who directs them there quickly. Once they are back with Julian and George for breakfast, Dick and Anne tell the story of the bells and the message. Julian says that the bells signalled an escape from a prison, and the escaped prisoner meant to meet ‚ÄúDirty Dick‚Äù Taggart at the barn, and Anne says that is how the prisoner recognised Dick‚Äôs name. After this, the Five report the incident to the village police but the sergeant is extremely angry and strongly suspects the children are telling him lies. The Five decide to hike to ‚ÄúGloomy Water‚Äù higher on the moors and sleep in an old ruin, where they recognise that the message Dick was given was a clue to find stolen goods from a past robbery by a prisoner called ‚ÄúNailer‚Äù, and that it was hidden in a boat called ‚ÄúSaucy Jane‚Äù in the lake. Just as the Five realise where the loot is hidden, Maggie and Dirty Dick come to Gloomy Water to find it, but Timmy growls at the unpleasant-looking, chain-smoking couple, who want to wait for the Five to clear off. The Five, however, paddle into the lake on a raft but do not find anything, and the following morning, with the two villains absent, try to work out where the ‚ÄúSaucy Jane‚Äù is from various clues on the paper given to Dick, including ‚ÄúTall Stone‚Äù, which they ultimately recognise as being seen clearly from where the loot is. Ultimately, with intense efforts to keep their raft steady, the Five locate the ‚ÄúSaucy Jane‚Äù at the bottom of the lake, then Maggie and Dirty Dick come in again, when Julian says they will be gone tomorrow to return to school. Thus, the Five return on the raft near midnight and Julian (a star swimmer at school) and Dick dive to the boat to collect the loot after failing to dislodge it the first time, and when they are able to force it from the sunken boat they find diamond and gold necklaces stolen from the Queen of Fallonia. Although it was 2:30 AM when they recovered the jewels, the Five already plan to get them to the police, since Julian said the box was too heavy, and when they evade Maggie and Dick again and get back to Reebles to call Mr. Gaston, he is astonished that they have found the Fallonia jewels, and so are the police when the Five give the story of how they found them. At the same time, Maggie and Dirty Dick are stuck in marshland near the lake and are ultimately arrested themselves.

Two scientist colleagues of George's father, Uncle Quentin, visit Kirrin Cottage to work on an alternative energy project. One of them is a large friendly American, Elbur Wright. His only daughter, Berta, is later threatened with being kidnapped and ransomed for the project's secrets. Elbur decides to send Berta to Kirrin for her safety. George takes an instant disliking to Berta, especially as the American girl has brought her dog, a poodle called Sally. George's resentment is furthered when Berta's hair is cut short to make her resemble a boy. Berta is also dressed as a boy and referred to as Lesley to throw the kidnappers off her scent. A few days later, Uncle Quentin receives an urgent message to meet with Elbur to discuss calculations for their energy project. He leaves with his wife, Aunt Fanny, and plans to be gone for a week, leaving the children alone with Joan, the cook. That night, George lends Timmy to protect Berta in Joan's bedroom, while Sally is put in George's bedroom. Irked by the poodle, George decides to put her outside in Timmy's kennel but the kidnappers are waiting and seize George, mistaking her for Berta.

The Roman province of Germania Germania ((also sometimes called Germania Antiqua) was a short-lived Roman province for the duration of 16 years under Augustus, from 7 BC to AD 9. The possible capital of this province was Marktbreit () -a recently discovered castrum (Roman legionary fortification) with a nearby Canabae (Roman Vicus) from the period of Emperor Augustus- located 70 km east of the \\"Limes Germanicus\\" on the River Main History The Romans under Augustus began to conquer and defeat the peoples of Germania Magna in 12 BC, having the Legati (generals) Germanicus, and Tiberius leading the Legions. By 6 AD, all of Germania up to the River Elbe was temporarily pacified by the Romans as well as being occupied by them, with Publius Quinctilius Varus being (unofficially) appointed as Germania's governor. But the Teutoburg forest disaster of 9 AD made Augustus change his plans. Indeed the Roman plan to complete the conquest and incorporate all of Magna Germania into the Roman Empire was frustrated when three Roman legions under Varus command were annihilated by the German tribesmen in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in 9 AD. Augustus then ordered Roman withdrawal from Magna Germania (completed by AD 16) and established the boundary of the Roman Empire as being the Rhine and the Danube. Under Emperors Vespasian and Domitian, the Roman Empire occupied the region known as the Agri Decumates between the Main, Danube and Rhine rivers. The region soon became a vital part of the Limes Germanicus with dozens of Roman forts. The Agri Decumates were finally abandoned to the Germanic Alemanni, after the Emperor Probus' death (282).D. Geuenich, Geschichte der Alemannen, p. 23 Some parts of this early province were incorporated into either Germania inferior or Germania superior in AD 85.

Upon arrival, they are greeted by the pleasant Mrs Philpot and her identical twins, Henry and Harriet. The twins seem to take an instant dislike to the Five. The Five also meet two fellow paying guests: an American Mr Henning and his son, Junior. Mr Henning plans to buy antique pieces from the farm and sell them in America. Mr and Mrs Philpot agree to sell their farm treasures as they need the money. However the family's hot-tempered Great Granddad feels the antiques should remain in England. Mr Henning and Junior prove themselves a nuisance to the household by rudely ordering around Mrs Philpot. Sympathetic to Mrs Philpot, the Five offer to help with farm chores. When Junior demands breakfast in bed, George teaches him a lesson, making him agree to not slave Mrs Philpot thereafter. This wins the hearts of the Harries and they make friends with the Five. Anne and George visit a nearby antique shop, owned by a Mr Finniston, who tells them about a secret passage from Finniston Castle to an old chapel and cellars where royal treasure might be hidden. The girls excitedly reveal the news to the boys and the twins. Together, they plan to hunt for the cellars on the farm. They come across the castle's kitchen midden and realize they are close to finding the treasure.

Mr and Mrs Philpot consent to the excavation, much to the dismay of the children. The children dig around the site, hoping to beat the men in finding the treasure.

The next day, Mr Henning and Mr Durleston try to trick the Philpots into believing the site has no treasure and offer them a meagre amount.

Variations include Hinchinbroke, Hinchinbrooke, Hinchingbroke, Hinchingbrook and Hinchingbrooke. She was Captain Horatio Nelson's second navy command, after the brig , and his first as post-captain. She was wrecked, with no loss of life, in January 1783. Privateering career Hinchinbrook started life as the French merchant vessel Astr√©e, built in 1778 at Nantes, and her owners were Guilliaume and Son, of that city. She was carrying a cargo of bricks and bale goods from Nantes when a British squadron under Captain Joseph Deane in captured her off Cape Fran√ßois, on 13 October 1778. She was described as being a ship of 650 tons, armed with 14 guns, and under the command of Louis David, master. A prize crew then took her into port, where the Royal Navy purchased her for the sum of ¬£5,650 on 1 December 1778, renaming her as a courtesy to Viscount Hinchinbroke, eldest son of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, First Lord of the Admiralty in Lord North's administration. British career Admiral Sir Peter Parker had intended to have Hinchinbrook upgraded to a 32-gun fifth rate, but this never came about. Instead, she became a 28-gun sixth rate, with a crew of 200 men. She was commissioned that December at Jamaica under Commander Christopher Parker. In May 1779, Captain Charles Nugent replaced Parker, who had been promoted to post captain in March. In September, Captain Horatio Nelson took command of Hinchinbrook and escorted a convoy to Greytown, Nicaragua. Nelson and Hinchinbrook were based in the San Juan River from January until April 1780. Hinchinbrooks assignment was to support an expedition that Major-General John Dalling's wanted to capture the Spanish colonies in Central America, including an assault on the fortress of San Juan. Hinchinbrook was to take troops to the mouth of the San Juan River and wait for their return. The troops would go 70 miles up the river, take the fort, and then go on to capture other Spanish possessions. The expeditionary force was small, it was the dry season and so the river was low, and the climate was putrid. Nelson decided to leave Hinchinbrook and take the troops up the river himself. He used small boats that would ground in the shallows and have to be dragged by hand. At one point, a barefoot Nelson led a small group of sailors to capture the out fort of San Bartholomew. The force eventually did reach Fort San Juan and captured it, but between war and disease, about 140 of Hinchinbrook's crew of 200 men died and the whole expedition too was decimated. Nelson himself became ill, and debilitated by dysentery, withdrew Hinchinbrook back down the river. His friend Captain Cuthbert Collingwood replaced him in command of Hinchinbrook and brought the remainder of the expedition back to Jamaica. (Nelson and Collingwood had served together three years earlier in ; the transport Victor took Nelson from Hinchinbrook to Jamaica, where he took command of the frigate of 44 guns.) Collingwood remained in command of Hinchinbrook until December, when Captain Charles Hotchkys replaced him. Hotchkys's replacement, in February 1781, was Captain George Stoney, who in turn was replaced by Captain Sylverius Moriaty in June 1781. Moriaty was one among many navy personnel who suffered in the unhealthy climate of the West Indies; he was twice relieved during his period of command by Captain John Fish due to his health problems. Fish last commanded Hinchinbrook from 21 September 1781 to 12 February 1782, but apparently was on six weeks leave in January 1782.Oberg (1781), p.87. On 13 January 1782 Admiral Peter Parker appointed Lieutenant John Markham to command Hinchinbroke. Markham's orders were to cruise off the east end of Jamaica to protect trade.Markham (1883), p.65. Fate Hinchinbrook left Port Royal, Jamaica on 19 January 1782 and almost immediately started to take on water. The next day Markham decided to try to get to St Anne‚Äôs Bay, Jamaica but as she approached the harbour she stopped responding to the helm and she ran aground on the west reef going into the harbour. Despite numerous efforts, her crew was unable to get her over or off the reef. A schooner came alongside and took off her guns, some stores, and her crew. She then sank that night.Hepper (1994), pp.66-7. Footnotes ;Notes ;Citations References * *Demerliac, Alain (1996) La Marine De Louis XVI: Nomenclature Des Navires Fran√ßais De 1774 √Ä 1792.

Sir John Rolt PC QC (5 October 1804 ‚Äì 6 June 1871) was an English lawyer, Conservative politician and judge who served as Attorney General under Lord Derby. Early life John was the second son of James Rolt, a merchant of Calcutta, and Anne n√©e Braine. He was born at Calcutta and brought to England by his mother about 1810. He was educated at dissenting private schools at Chipping Norton and Islington. His father died in 1813, and his mother in the following year. Around Christmas 1818, Rolt was apprenticed to a London firm of woollendrapers. Though his hours were long, he managed, by early rising and reading as he walked, to educate himself despite the disadvantages of his early life. On the expiration of his indentures in 1822‚Äì1823, he found employment in a Manchester warehouse in Newgate Street, which he exchanged in 1827 for a clerkship in a proctor's office at Doctors' Commons. His next step was to obtain two secretaryships. One to a school for orphans, the other to the Mill Hill School.Rigg (1897) Legal and political careers Meanwhile, he pursued his studies, and in 1833 entered the Inner Temple, where he was called to the Bar on 9 June 1837. Confining himself to the Court of Chancery, he rapidly acquired an extensive practice, in particular following his opinion for a large London firm in Stubbs v Lister,(1841) 1 Y & C Ch Cas 81 which also led to a friendship with Edwin Wilkins Field.Rigg, rev. Polden (2004) He took silk in Trinity vacation 1846. After some unsuccessful attempts to enter parliament, he was returned for the Conservatives for West Gloucestershire on 31 March 1857, and for ten years continued to represent the same constituency. In 1862 he carried through the House of Commons the measure commonly known as Rolt's Act,25 and 26 Vict. c. 42 by which an important step was taken towards the fusion of law and equity. In 1866 he succeeded Sir Hugh Cairns as Attorney General on 29 October, and was knighted on 10 November. On 18 July 1867 he succeeded Sir George James Turner as Lord Justice of Appeal, and on 3 August was sworn to the Privy Council. Incipient paralysis, due to long-continued overwork, compelled his resignation in February 1868, and on 6 June 1871 he died at his estate, Ozleworth Park, Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire. He was buried on 12 June in Ozleworth churchyard. Private and family life In early life Rolt abandoned the dissenters and became a passionate adherent of the Church of England. He married twice: *In 1826 to Sarah (died 1850), daughter of Thomas Bosworth of Bosworth, Leicestershire. The couple had four daughters and a son who succeeded to John's property. *In 1857 to Elizabeth (died 1867), daughter of Stephen Godson of Croydon. The couple had a son. Legacy and assessment It has been said that In parliament Rolt made no great figure, but he voted steadily with his party, and did the drudgery connected with the carriage of the Reform Bill of 1867. Rolt was neither a profound lawyer nor a great advocate; but he was thoroughly versed in chancery practice, had sound judgment, and quickness of apprehension.

Plot The book starts out with the Five riding their bikes to the coast near Whispering Island. There they meet wild Wilfrid, and befriend him, although with a few upsets. Despite the Five's resolve to keep adventures out, they get stranded on Whispering Island, the island which is rumoured to have strange goings-on, as described by Lucas, the man who works at the golf-course on the coast (formerly one of the guardians of the island, recruited by the original owners). When Wilfrid accidentally finds out that someone is stealing the old treasures of the island, he needs to find out who, along with the Five. As they climb into the grounds of the castle to find the stolen treasure, they get locked up in a cellar with the stolen treasure by the thieves. Before the they came back, the Five and Wilfrid used the items inside the cellar and escaped up a \\"ventilation hole\\", as described by Dick (This is a typical way of escape that Enid Blyton uses). The thieves bewildered, the Five manage to escape the cellar and run to the coast, along with flinging a table at some of the thieves as well. the Five managed to escape the cellar, but as they were tired out, decided to risk sleeping on the island and give up trying to look for WIlfrid's boat (the transportation Wilfrid originally used to get to Whispering Island when the Five (without Wilfrid) got stranded). The men stealing the treasure tried to escape using Wilfrid's boat, Anne and Timmy-dog managed to shoo them away from their boat and the men ended up escaping in their own. After this development, the Five and Wilfrid began to feel excited, and Anne convinced the others to row back to the coast and into Wilfrid's cottage. Enid Blyton then quickly describes the Five and Wilfrid's day with the police, and skips over to the part where the Famous Five and Wilfrid are right beside the cottage enjoying themselves. Enid Blyton resolves the book happily.

Smith Creek restoration project Smith Creek has been the beneficiary of a large-scale stream restoration project to revitalize the stream to a point where the native trout species can again thrive. Prior to the Civil War, trout up to 5 and 6 pounds were common in the stream, but as forested land was converted to pasture land for livestock the stream became unsuitable for fish. Restoration techniques include restricting livestock's access to the stream, which will reduce sediment and contamination from fecal bacteria, and planting grasses and trees along the banks, which will reduce erosion and sediment and reduce the stream's temperature by shading the water from the summer sun. By 2006, populations have already been reestablished in Mountain Run, and they have begun migrating downstream.Austin, Luanne.

It won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1950. Plot It is 1949, and colonial Nigeria is undergoing an identity crisis. There is a clash between the progressive, educated elements of society - those who desire westernization and modernity- and traditionalists who want to maintain Nigerian heritage. Two young African teachers, Iruka and Dominic (Fanny Elumeze, Harford Anerobi) decide the village of Udi should have a maternity home, itself a symbol of progressiveness and modernization. The British District Officer, E.R. Chadwick (E.R. Chadwick), after some persuasion, assents to this decision and agrees to provide the resources for the project. Before work can begin, Chadwick wants to ensure that everyone in the village is on board for the task, but it quickly becomes clear that this is not the case. A man named Eze (Josef Amalu), an elderly resident, believes that building the maternity home is both an affront to the tradition and culture of the village, and works to persuade others towards his view. Chadwick visits the village in an attempt to convince the villagers otherwise, a task in which he ultimately succeeds. Work on the maternity home begins in earnest. Although it will prove a long, arduous process, the villagers band together to construct the building. They are interrupted by Eze, who arrives at the building site and claims that it is an old burial ground. He predicts that the builders will invoke the ire of the ancestors for disturbing the site and violating custom. Cultural values quickly manifest. Fear and superstition briefly stop the work, but Chadwick and Dominic arrive to allay the workers' fears and restart the building project. However, Eze‚Äôs threat looms large in the back of their minds. In time the building is complete, but before it is set to officially open, a young woman and her husband arrive in the village. The woman is in labor, and so Chadwick and the midwife (Joyce MgBaronye) agree to admit the woman as the home's first patient. That evening, while tending the woman, the midwife catches sight of movement and hears noises coming from outside. Frightened, she soon hears a knock at the door, but it turns out only to be Iruka coming to check up on the expectant mother. Relieved, the midwife resumes her work while Iruka sets a pot of water to boil on the fire. Shortly thereafter, there is another noise, and when looking out the window the midwife spots a masked figure peering in. Believing the masked figure to be a spirit of the ancestors, the midwife cries out in fear, but Iruka throws the boiling water onto the figure, revealing Eze, who flees back into the surrounding overgrowth. The next day the villagers march up to the maternity home for the opening ceremony, a traditional one complete with dancing, music, singing, and native costumes. Chadwick takes the center seat in front of the maternity home to watch the events, with Eze sitting near him. Eze has finally accepted that tradition and progress, as visible in the final scene, can go together after all. In the closing narration, Chadwick tells the viewer that progress brings \\"power, spirit, unlimited and unknown possibilities and destinations\\" and suggests that progress should be the ultimate goal of native society.

Ancestors, their ghosts, or spirits, and gods are considered part of \\"this world\\", that is, they are neither supernatural (in the sense of being outside nature) nor transcendent in the sense of being beyond nature. The ancestors are humans who have become godly beings, beings who keep their individual identities. For this reason, Chinese religion is founded on veneration of ancestors. Ancestors are believed to be a means of connection to the supreme power of Tian as they are considered embodiments or reproducers of the creative order of Heaven. Ancestor veneration is completely or almost exclusively focused on male ancestors hence one of its names being \\"Chinese patriarchal religion\\" as it was believed that because women did not pass down surnames, they were incapable of carrying down a bloodline. Han Chinese people trace their ancestry through their male lineages (their father's father and so on) which are recorded in genealogy books and they consider their ancestral home to be where their patriline ancestor was born (usually about five generations back) or the origin of their surname. Confucian philosophy calls for paying respect to one's ancestors, an aspect of filial piety; Zhuo Xinping (2011) views traditional patriarchal religion as the religious organisation complementing the ideology of Confucianism. As the \\"bedrock faith of the Chinese\\", traditional patriarchal religion influences the religious psychology of all Chinese and has influenced the other religions of China, as it is evident in the worship of founders of temples and schools of thought in Taoism and Chinese Buddhism. Ancestor veneration practices prevail in South China, where lineage bonds are stronger and the patrilineal hierarchy is not based upon seniority and access to corporate resources held by a lineage is based upon the equality of all the lines of descent; whereas in North China worship of communal deities is prevalent. Definition An ancestral worship ceremony led by Taoist priests at the pyramidal-shaped Great Temple of Zhang Hui ( ZhƒÅng Huƒ´ g≈çng d√†di√†n), the central ancestral shrine dedicated to the progenitor of the Zhang lineage, located at Zhangs' ancestral home in Qinghe, Hebei. Some contemporary scholars in China have adopted the names \\"Chinese traditional patriarchal religion\\" ( Zh≈çnggu√≥ chu√°nt«íng z≈çngf«é x√¨ng z≈çngji√†o) or \\"Chinese traditional primordial religion\\" ( Zh≈çnggu√≥ chu√°nt«íng yu√°nshƒìng x√¨ng z≈çngji√†o) to define the traditional religious system organised around the worship of ancestor-gods.Zhang Jin, Yang Chunpeng. ‚Äú (\\"Chinese traditional primordial religion\\": generation and characteristics). China Ethnic and Religious Network (), 2013. China Confucius Network: Mou Zhongjian defines \\"clan-based traditional patriarchal religion\\" as \\"an orthodox religion that was widely accepted by all classes, and had been practiced for thousands of years in ancient China\\". Mou also says that this religion was subordinate to the state, it was \\"diverse and inclusive\\" and had \\"a humanistic spirit that emphasises the social, moral function of religion\\", and is closely related to politics. It refers to: :¬´[...] The traditional religion that had been in place since the Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties. It evolved from the worship of Heaven and ancestors. It had the basic components of a religion, including religious concepts, emotions, and rituals. It had no independent organisation. Instead, it was the kinship structure that fulfilled the functions of religious organisation. The emperor, who was the son of God, was the representative of the people who worshiped Heaven. Elders of the clans and parents represented the family in the worship of ancestors. Respecting Heaven and honoring ancestors (jingtian fazu), taking good care in seeing off the deceased, and maintaining sacrifices to distant ancestors (shenzhong zhuiyuan) were the basic religious concepts and emotional expressions in this religion. [...]¬ª According to Zhuo Xinping (2011), Chinese patriarchal religion and Confucianism complemented each other in ancient China, as the Confucian religion traditionally lacked a social religious organisation while traditional patriarchal religion lacked an ideological doctrine. Practices stone tortoise with the \\"Stele of Divine Merits and Saintly Virtues\\" (Shengong Shende), erected by the Yongle Emperor in 1413 in honor of his father, the Hongwu Emperor in the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum (\\"Ming Mausoleum of Filial Piety\\"). In Chinese folk religion, a person is thought to have multiple souls, categorized as hun and po, commonly associated with yang and yin, respectively. Upon death, hun and po separate. Generally, the former ascends into heaven and latter descends into the earth and/or resides within a spirit tablet; however, beliefs concerning the number and nature of souls vary.Richard J. Smith (2007). Settling the Dead: Funerals, Memorials and Beliefs Concerning the Afterlife. Retrieved October 21, 2008, from Living in the Chinese Cosmos: Understanding Religion in Late-Imperial China: http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/cosmos/prb/journey.htm In accordance with these traditional beliefs, various practices have arisen to address the perceived needs of the deceased. =Mourning= The mourning of a loved one usually involves elaborate rituals, which vary according to region and sect. The intensity of the mourning is thought to reflect the quality of relationship one had with the deceased. From the time of Confucius until the 20th century, a three-year mourning period was often prescribed, mirroring the first three years in a child's life when they are utterly dependent upon and loved unconditionally by their parents. These mourning practices would often include wearing sackcloth or simple garb, leaving hair unkempt, eating a restricted diet of congee two times a day, living in a mourning shack placed beside the house, and moaning in pain at certain intervals of the day. It is said that after the death of Confucius his followers engaged in this three-year mourning period to symbolize their commitment to his teachings. =Funeral rites= A funeral procession in Zhejiang province Funerals are considered to be a part of the normal process of family life, serving as a cornerstone in inter- generational traditions. The primary goals, regardless of religious beliefs, are to demonstrate obeisance and provide comfort for the deceased. Other goals include: to protect the descendants of the deceased from malevolent spirits and to ensure the proper separation and direction of the deceased's soul into the afterlife. Some common elements of Chinese funerals include the expression of grief through prolonged, often exaggerated wailing; the wearing of white mortuary clothes by the family of the deceased; a ritual washing of the corpse, followed by its attiring in grave clothes; the transfer of symbolic goods such as money and food from the living to the dead; the preparation and installation of a spirit tablet or the use of a personator, often symbolic. Sometimes, ritual specialists such as Taoist priests or Buddhist monks would be hired to perform specific rites, often accompanied by the playing of music or chanting of scripture to drive away evil spirits.Thompson, L. G. (1979). Chinese Religion: An Introduction Third Edition. Belmont, California: Wadsworth, Inc. =Burial= A typical traditional hill slope cemetery of China's southeastern coast Burial is often delayed according to wealth; the coffin would remain in the main room of the family home until it has been properly prepared for burial. More traditionally, this delay is pre-determined according to social status: the corpse of a king or emperor would be held in abeyance for seven months; magnates, five; other officers, three; commoners, one. In some instances, a \\"lucky burial\\" can take place several years after the burial. The bones are dug up, washed, dried, and stored in an earthenware jar. After a period of storage, the contents are then interred in their final resting place in a location selected by an augur to optimize the flow of qi. A bad qi flow could result in a disgruntled spirit who could possibly haunt their descendants.ReligionFacts. (2005, June 2). Ancestor Veneration. Retrieved October 21, 2008, from www.religionfacts.com: http://www.religionfacts.com/chinese_religion/practices/ancestor_worship.htm The deceased would often be buried with sacrifices, typically things one was thought to be in need of in the afterlife. This was done as a symbolic demonstration of filial piety or grandeur. For the wealthy and powerful, bronze vessels, oracle bones, and human or animal sacrifices often accompanied the deceased into the grave. More common sacrifices included candles and incense, as well as offerings of wine and food. =Continued obeisance= After the funeral, families often install an ancestral tablet at a household altar alongside other deceased ancestors. This act symbolically unifies the ancestors and honors the family lineage. Incense is lit before the altar daily, significant announcements are made before them, and offerings such as favorite foods, beverages, and spirit money are given bi-monthly and on special occasions, such as Qingming Festival and Zhong Yuan Festival. Prayer was usually performed at the household altar in a separate room containing the po of their ancestors. The eldest male would speak to the altar on a regular basis. In some belief systems where special powers are ascribed to the deceased, he may supplicate the spirit to bless the family.

ISRI also publishes Scrap, a bimonthly magazine of scrap recycling industry news, features, trends, market statistics, business management, environmental compliance, legislative activities, scrap processing and handling equipment and technology, international market and trade developments and more. Each issue also contains a profile feature on a scrap processing company, a scrap consuming operation, and an equipment manufacturer. Regular departments cover market trends, industry news, new products, personnel changes, and industry meetings.  Metals theft  ISRI operates a free web-based alert system seeking to connect law enforcement communities and scrap yard operators in the investigation and prevention of materials theft. This service, Scrap Theft Alert, is online at www.scraptheftalert.com. Law enforcement officials can post information about stolen scrap materials, or materials that have been stolen by thieves that could be sold for scrap. The reports are turned into alerts that are then broadcast over the Internet to all member scrap yards within a 200-mile radius.  Electronics recycling  Electronic scrap recycling is one of the most dynamic and fastest growing segments of the scrap recycling industry and generated an estimated revenue of more than $5.2 billion to the U.S. economy in 2010, employed more than 30,000 full-time employees in the private sector and when non-profit organizations are included, more than 45,000 people; and collected and processed domestically more than 3.5 million of used and end-of- life electronics. These figures are up, ISRI reports, from up from less than $1 billion in economic impact, 6,000 full-time employees and processing output in 2002. ISRI, along with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, industry representatives and other stakeholders, helped develop the Responsible Recycling certification standard for Electronics Recyclers, (R2),http://www.r2rios.org an environmental safety standard that seeks to implement environmental, health and safety regulations for electronics recyclers in the absence of regulation in the U.S. Companies certified to the standard agree to meet and maintain specific health and safety requirements in the process of dismantling and recycling scrap electronics. ISRI also developed the RIOS standard to help improve the recycling industry overall and is available to any recycler, not just electronics recyclers.  Recycling industry jobs  ISRI produces periodic reports detailing information on the state of the U.S. scrap recycling industry. Several recent studies show that the U.S. scrap recycling industry creates and supports hundreds of thousands jobs in the United States and generates billions in revenue for federal, state and local governments across the country. Currently, the organization estimates 534,500 jobs are supported by the recycling industry in the U.S., and that the industry contributes $117 billion in annual economic benefit. The organization also tracks jobs created by export of scrap material to overseas markets, where scrap plastics, paper and metal are refined and processed before re-entering the manufacturing stream. According to a study conducted by John Dunham and Associates for ISRI, U.S. scrap exports directly and indirectly support some 134,000 U.S. jobs while having generated $28.8 billion in export sales in 2017, helping the U.S. balance of trade.

Today, the Royal Coachman and its variations are tied mostly as dry flies and fished floating on the water surface. It is a popular and widely used pattern for freshwater game fish, particularly trout and grayling. Large streamer versions are also used for winter steelhead and Atlantic salmon. In Royal Coachman‚ÄîThe Lore and Legends of Fly-Fishing (1999) Paul Schullery describes the Royal Coachman:  Origin  The Royal Coachman was first tied as a traditional winged wet fly and is a derivative of the Coachman wet fly. Mary Orvis Marbury in her Favorite Flies and Their Histories (1892) tells the story of its creation as follows: > The Royal Coachman was first made in 1878 by John Haily, a professional fly- > dresser living in New York City. In writing of other matters, he inclosed > [sic] a sample of this fly for us to see, saying: \\"A gentleman wanted me to > tie some Coachmen for him to take up into the north woods, and to make them > extra strong, so I have tied them with a little band of silk in the middle, > to prevent the peacock bodies from fraying out. I have also added a tail of > the barred feathers of the wood-duck, and I think it makes a very handsome > fly.\\" A few evenings later, a circle of us were together \\"disputing the fly > question,\\" one of the party claiming that numbers were \\"quite as suitable to > designate the flies as so many nonsensical names.\\" The others did not agree > with him, but he said: \\"What can you do? Here is a fly intended to be a > Coachman, yet it is not the true Coachman; it is quite unlike it, and what > can you call it?\\" Mr. L. C. Orvis, brother of Mr. Charles Orvis, who was > present, said: \\"Oh, that is easy enough; call it the Royal Coachman, it is > so finely dressed!\\" And this name in time came to be known and used by all > who are familiar with the fly. The Royal Coachman pattern is one of the very few patterns that appeared in Marbury's work that is still being tied and fished today in some form or another.  Imitates  A #12 Royal Wulff dry fly, a Royal Coachman derivative The Royal Coachman and its derivatives are considered attractor patterns, or as Dave Hughes in Trout Flies-The Tier's Reference (1999) calls them‚Äîsearching patterns‚Äîas they do not resemble any specific insect or baitfish. Early in the 20th century, Theodore Gordon once was of the opinion that the Royal Coachman resembled some form of flying ant, while in the 1950s, Preston Jennings, a noted fly tier and angler thought the Royal Coachman resembled Isonychia mayflies.  Materials  The distinguishing features of any Royal Coachman or its derivatives are the peacock herl body partitioned with red silk or floss, a white wing and brown or red-brown hackle. Depending on whether the fly is tied as a dry fly, wet fly or streamer the white wing can be made with white duck quill, bucktail, calf tail, hen neck, hackle points or other white material. Tailing has varied over the years from the original wood duck flank to include golden pheasant tippet, brown or red hackle, moose, elk and deer hair.  Variations and sizes  There are many variations on the original Royal Coachman. Typically dry fly variations are tied on hook sizes 10‚Äì16, wet fly versions on hook sizes 8‚Äì14 and streamer versions on hook sizes 1 to 8. Commonly named variations include: * Royal Trude ‚Äì a down hair wing dry fly * Royal Coachman Bucktail ‚Äì a hair wing streamer pattern * Royal Coachman Streamer ‚Äì a feather wing streamer pattern * Fanwing Royal Coachman ‚Äì a dry fly * Royal Wulff ‚Äì a hair wing dry fly * Royal Humpy ‚Äì a hair bodied dry fly * Royal Sakasa Kebari ‚Äì a reverse tied soft hackled tenkara wet fly External links * Royal Coachman Wet on Flyanglersonline * Fanwing Royal Coachman on Flyanglersonline * Hair-wing Royal Coachman on Flyanglersonline * Royal Coachman Dry Fly Notes Category:Dry fly patterns Category:Wet fly patterns Category:Streamer patterns ","title":"Royal Coachman"},{"id":"20113835","text":"Osama Hussain (), is a Kuwaiti football Right-back, centre-back.

Once again, however, Contreras was released during spring training in 1979. =With the White Sox= Contreras signed with the White Sox in May, and was assigned to the Triple-A Iowa Oaks. Once more used mostly as a starter, his numbers were not as impressive in 1979. Although he won more than he lost at 7-6, his ERA shot up to 5.97. He returned to Iowa in 1980, this time posting better numbers (9-7, 4.19 ERA in 20 games, all as a starter), and got his first, and what would prove to be his only, shot at the major leagues. Although he had been a starter in the minors in 1980, the White Sox used Contreras exclusively as a reliever during his two brief stints in the majors. He appeared in a total of eight games, with no wins or losses and a 5.93 ERA. Contreras was generally used as a mopup man, and the White Sox lost each of the eight games in which Contreras appeared. =Post-major leagues= Contreras returned to the minors for the White Sox, pitching sparingly over the next two seasons for their new Triple-A affiliate, the Edmonton Trappers. Contreras appeared in 11 games in 1981 and just one in 1982. Contreras was out of organized ball for the next several years. He resurfaced in 1989, pitching briefly for the St. Petersburg Pelicans of the short-lived Senior Professional Baseball Association. Coaching Following his playing career, Contreras served as a coach in several major league organizations, including a few at the major league level. He was the pitching coach for the New York Yankees in 1995, the Seattle Mariners in 1997-98, and then with the team that gave him his shot at the majors, the White Sox, from 1998 until 2002. In 2005, he returned to the Yankees organization, where he currently serves as their minor league pitching coordinator. He gained recognition for developing pitch count guidelines-- styled \\"Joba rules\\"--for Joba Chamberlain.Contreras Controls Joba Rules References External links Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:American expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Baseball coaches from Florida Category:Baseball players from Florida Category:Chicago White Sox coaches Category:Chicago White Sox players Category:Edmonton Trappers players Category:Iowa Oaks players Category:Key West Conchs players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball pitching coaches Category:New York Yankees coaches Category:Oklahoma City 89ers players Category:Raleigh-Durham Triangles players Category:Reading Phillies players Category:Seattle Mariners coaches Category:Sioux Falls Packers players Category:Sportspeople from Tampa, Florida Category:Tampa Tarpons (1957‚Äì1987) players Category:Tidewater Tides players Category:Visalia Mets players Category:Victoria Toros players ","title":"Nardi Contreras"},{"id":"20113970","title":"List of tallest buildings in South America"},{"id":"20113971","text":"Cisco Security Monitoring, Analysis, and Response System (MARS) was a security monitoring tool for network devices.

(Jack) Finklea was a physician, professor, researcher, and public health administrator notable for his leadership at the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Background John Finklea, a native of Florence, South Carolina, earned his B.S. from Davidson College at Davidson, N.C., and his M.D. from the Medical University of South Carolina. He also received master's and doctorate degrees in public health from the University of Michigan. Finklea began his medical career as a physician and a professor at a series of medical schools. His interest in public health took root as he researched air pollution health hazards for the Federal government. EPA From 1970 through 1974, Finklea served as head to the Environmental Protection Agency's National Environmental Research Laboratory in Durham, N.C. At the EPA, Finklea gained a reputation as an agitator (according to Business Week) for controversial research on the health effects of atmospheric sulfates from power plants. The research connected sulfur dioxide emissions to acid rain, a conclusion that rankled many in the power industry. He opposed the use of catalytic converters to control auto emissions because of their adverse environmental impact, a stand that directly conflicted with EPA policy. These controversies put pressure on Finklea to resign, which he did at the end of 1974. NIOSH =Appointment as director= Finklea took over as director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in April, 1975. He replaced Dr. Marcus M. Key, the Institute‚Äôs first director. Following Key's resignation, deputy director Edward Baier had served as acting director and many within the Institute expected Baier to be appointed to the post. Finklea took over NIOSH in the midst of Congressional complaints that NIOSH was too soft on industry, industry claims that NIOSH's research was sloppy, and organized labor accusations that NIOSH was overly slow in sharing important health data. Finklea worked to accelerate health hazard research, especially in the chemical industry. Over Finklea's tenure, NIOSH identified 65 potentially dangerous substances found at job sites, as compared to the 23 such warnings issued during the first four years of NIOSH's existence. Within months of his appointment, Finklea had NIOSH issuing a steady stream of alerts on toxic substances. Dr. Finklea had the reputation, which he had earned, of knowing everything that was going on in NIOSH research. When he was doing his quarterly \\"rounds\\" in Morgantown and Cincinnati, he would often stop random people and ask them where they worked. When they told him, he would tell them what project they worked on and how they were doing. He was a \\"hands-on\\" administrator, and he was missed when he left NIOSH. =Chemical identification= Under Finklea's leadership, NIOSH issued a register of 100 chemical compounds considered potential carcinogens. He encouraged cooperation between NIOSH, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), chemical process companies in the effort. His was one of several voices working to increase awareness for birth defects, miscarriages, and other reproduction-related problems stemming from chemical and radiological exposure. Additionally, Finklea called on Congress to adopt toxic substances legislation related to carcinogenic pesticides, and Kepone in particular. =Resource constraints= Finklea suggested that NIOSH did not have the resources to fully execute its mandate. For the millions of workers who Finklea claimed were at risk, NIOSH \\"would require the combined efforts of all government agencies involved in evaluating or regulating substances to which workers are exposed.\\" He was forced to drop a number of projects because of budget and workforce constraints, among them a study of workplace stress. With NIOSH's limited resources, Finklea chose to direct the researchers under him toward the completion of criteria documents‚Äîscientific literature surveys that determine the relative dangers of workplace substances. Preparation of the documents accounted for over 40% of NIOSH's budget. =Departure= After nearly three years as its director, John Finklea abruptly resigned. He did not publicly announce the departure or offer any specific reason. The Washington Post speculated that Finklea had been under pressure to resign because of what it called, \\"bureaucratic feuding\\". Finklea served temporarily as a special assistant to William Foege, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. His spot as direct was filled by J. Donald Millar, who described NIOSH at that time as being afflicted with \\"alienation and conflict\\". University of Alabama Finklea returned to academia at the University of Alabama as a professor of medicine at the medical school and as a professor of environmental sciences at the school of public health. He researched, among other things, the effects of welding gases and fumes. He was instrumental in establishing the University of Alabama Occupational Health Clinic. He retired from in 2000. CDC In 1989, Finklea became assistant director of the Injury Control Program at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, and he chaired its research review committee. Heart trouble In 1979, Finklea survived a coronary occlusion and bypass surgery. He had a second coronary occlusion and repeated bypass surgery in 1990.

Early life Teja was born on 22 February 1966 in Madras, Tamil Nadu, to Jasti Balaram Krishna and Jasti Rani. His father was an industrialist, based primarily in Tokyo, Japan. Early career Teja in 1994, shooting for Bollywood film, Ghulam Teja doing any work he could get, ended up working in Tamil film shoots as a lighting assistant. After working in lighting and sound departments he moved into the camera department and worked under Ravikant Nagaich, and W.B. Rao. He then took up assignments for documentaries presented in National Geographic Channel. He then joined the bandwagon of Bollywood. Directorial debut Working as cinematographer, Teja used to frequently schedule Hindi film shoots in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh as to spend more time with his wife and son. Many schedules were planned in Ramoji Film City. Chitram, Teja's directorial debut was planned entirely in Ramoji Film City on budget of forty lakh rupees. The film became a huge hit and paved way for a variety of new age romantic films in Tollywood. Teja gained notability post the release of Nuvvu Nenu, an all-time blockbuster and that year's highest grosser. The film received six Nandi Awards and had a total run of three seventy five days. The film was also remade in Hindi starring Tushar Kapoor and Anita Hassanandani. Subsequent films Teja's next film was Nijam, was released in 2003 starring Mahesh Babu and Rakshitha in lead roles. Nijam was a low grosser at the box office but gained critical appraise. In the following year, Teja made Jai. Actor Navdeep debuted with the film, he was paired with Santhoshini and Ayesha Jhulka. It was dubbed in Tamil as Jairam. The film had an average run in both the languages. Teja later directed Dhairyam, and Avunanna Kadanna, simultaneously. Halfway through Dhairyam's shoot Teja dropped the project stating that the producer N. Sudhakar Reddy had changed and edited a part of the film without his consent. Teja returned his remuneration, arranged a press meet and declared he had nothing to do with the film. Dhairyam failed at the box office, whereas Avunanna Kadanna had a seventy-five-day run and was declared a hit. Film distribution Teja working in a construction site Teja also set up Chitram movies distribution offices in Hyderabad and Vizag.

The adsorption sites (heavy dots) are equivalent and can have unit occupancy. Also, the adsorbates are immobile on the surface. The Langmuir adsorption model explains adsorption by assuming an adsorbate behaves as an ideal gas at isothermal conditions. According to the model, adsorption and desorption are reversible processes. This model even explains the effect of pressure i.e at these conditions the adsorbate's partial pressure, p_A, is related to the volume of it, , adsorbed onto a solid adsorbent. The adsorbent, as indicated in the figure, is assumed to be an ideal solid surface composed of a series of distinct sites capable of binding the adsorbate. The adsorbate binding is treated as a chemical reaction between the adsorbate molecule A_\\\\text{g} and an empty site, . This reaction yields an adsorbed complex A_\\\\text{ad} with an associated equilibrium constant K_\\\\text{eq}: : A_{g}{} + S <=> A_{ad} From these assumptions the Langmuir isotherm can be derived (see below), which states that :\\\\theta_A = \\\\frac{V}{V_\\\\text{m}} = \\\\frac{K_\\\\text{eq}^A\\\\,p_A}{1 + K_\\\\text{eq}^A\\\\,p_A}, where \\\\theta_A is the fractional occupancy of the adsorption sites, and V_\\\\text{m} is the volume of the monolayer. A continuous monolayer of adsorbate molecules surrounding a homogeneous solid surface is the conceptual basis for this adsorption model. Background and experiments In 1916, Irving Langmuir presented his model for the adsorption of species onto simple surfaces. Langmuir was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1932 for his work concerning surface chemistry. He hypothesized that a given surface has a certain number of equivalent sites to which a species can ‚Äústick‚Äù, either by physisorption or chemisorption. His theory began when he postulated that gaseous molecules do not rebound elastically from a surface, but are held by it in a similar way to groups of molecules in solid bodies. Langmuir published two papers that proved the assumption that adsorbed films do not exceed one molecule in thickness. The first experiment involved observing electron emission from heated filaments in gases. The second, a more direct proof, examined and measured the films of liquid on an adsorbent surface layer. He also noted that generally the attractive strength between the surface and the first layer of adsorbed substance is much greater than the strength between the first and second layer. However, there are instances where the subsequent layers may condense given the right combination of temperature and pressure. Basic assumptions of the model Inherent within this model, the following assumptions are valid specifically for the simplest case: the adsorption of a single adsorbate onto a series of equivalent sites on the surface of the solid. # The surface containing the adsorbing sites is a perfectly flat plane with no corrugations (assume the surface is homogeneous). However, chemically heterogeneous surfaces can be considered to be homogeneous if the adsorbate is attracted to only one type of functional groups on the surface. # The adsorbing gas adsorbs into an immobile state. # All sites are energetically equivalent and the energy of adsorption is equal for all sites. # Each site can hold at most one molecule of A (mono-layer coverage only). # No (or ideal) Interactions between adsorbate molecules on adjacent sites. When the interactions are ideal, the energy of side-to-side interactions is equal for all sites regardless of the surface occupancy. Derivations of the Langmuir adsorption isotherm =Kinetic derivation= This section provides a kinetic derivation for a single adsorbate case. The multiple adsorbate case is covered in the Competitive adsorption sub-section. The model assumes adsorption and desorption as being elementary processes, where the rate of adsorption rad and the rate of desorption rd are given by :r_\\\\text{ad} = k_\\\\text{ad} \\\\, p_A \\\\, [S], :r_\\\\text{d} = k_d \\\\, [A_\\\\text{ad}], where PA is the partial pressure of A over the surface, [S] is the concentration of bare sites in number/m2, [Aad] is the surface concentration of A in molecules/m2, and kad and kd are constants of forward adsorption reaction and backward desorption reaction in the above reactions. At equilibrium, the rate of adsorption equals the rate of desorption. Setting rad = rd and rearranging, we obtain :\\\\frac {[A_\\\\text{ad}]}{p_A[S]} = \\\\frac{k_\\\\text{ad}}{k_\\\\text{d}} = K_\\\\text{eq}^A. The concentration of sites is given by dividing the total number of sites (S0) by the area of the adsorbate (a): :[S_0] = S_0/a. We can then calculate the concentration of all sites by summing the concentration of free sites [S] and occupied sites: :[S_0] = [S] + [A_\\\\text{ad}]. Combining this with the equilibrium equation, we get :[S_0] = \\\\frac{[A_\\\\text{ad}]}{K_\\\\text{eq}^A\\\\,p_A} + [A_\\\\text{ad}] = \\\\frac{1 + K_\\\\text{eq}^A\\\\,p_A}{K_\\\\text{eq}^A\\\\,p_A}\\\\,[A_\\\\text{ad}]. We define now the fraction of the surface sites covered with A, Œ∏A, as :\\\\theta_A = \\\\frac{[A_\\\\text{ad}]}{[S_0]}. This, applied to the previous equation that combined site balance and equilibrium, yields the Langmuir adsorption isotherm: :\\\\theta_A = \\\\frac{K_\\\\text{eq}^A\\\\,p_A }{1 + K_\\\\text{eq}^A\\\\,p_A}. =Thermodynamic derivation= In condensed phases (solutions), adsorption to a solid surface is a competitive process between the solvent (A) and the solute (B) to occupy the binding site. The equilibrium is described as the following: Solvent (bound) + Solute (free) ‚Üî Solvent (free) + Solute (bound) If we designate the solvent by the subscript \\"1\\" and the solute by \\"2\\", and the bound state by the superscript \\"s\\" (surface/bound) and the free state by the \\"b\\" (bulk solution / free), then the equilibrium constant can be written as a ratio between the activities of products over reactants: : K= \\\\frac{a_{1}^{b} \\\\times a_{2}^{s}}{a_{2}^{b} \\\\times a_{1}^{s} } For dilute solutions the activity of the solvent in bulk solution a_{1}^{b}‚âÉ1 and the activity coefficients (\\\\gamma) are also assumed to ideal on the surface. Thus, a_{2}^{s}=X_{2}^{s}=\\\\theta , a_{1}^{s}=X_{1}^{s}, and X_{1}^{s} + X_{2}^{s} = 1. (a: activity, X: mole fraction ) Re-writing the equilibrium constant and solving for \\\\theta: :\\\\theta = \\\\frac{K . a_{2}^{b}}{1+K . a_{2}^{b}} Note that the concentration of the solute adsorbate can be used instead of the activity coefficient. However, the equilibrium constant will no longer be dimensionless and will have units of 1/concentration units instead. The difference between the kinetic and thermodynamic derivations of the Langmuir model is that the thermodynamic uses activities as a starting point while the kinetic derivation uses rates of reaction. The thermodynamic derivation allows for the activity coefficients of adsorbates in their bound and free states to be included. The thermodynamic derivation is usually referred to as the \\"Langmuir-like equation\\". Physical Chemistry of Surfaces Sixth Edition ARTHUR W. ADAMSON =Statistical mechanical derivation= This derivation was originally provided by Volmer and Mahnert in 1925. The partition function of the finite number of adsorbents adsorbed on a surface, in a canonical ensemble, is given by :Z(N_A) = \\\\left[\\\\zeta^{N_A}_L\\\\frac{N_S!}{(N_S - N_A)!}\\\\right]\\\\frac{1}{N_A!}, where \\\\zeta_L is the partition function of a single adsorbed molecule, N_S is the number of adsorption sites (both occupied and unoccupied), and N_A is the number of adsorbed molecules which should be less than or equal to N_S. The terms in the bracket give the total partition function of the N_A adsorbed molecules by taking a product of the individual partition functions (refer to Partition function of subsystems). The 1/N_A! factor accounts for the overcounting arising due to the indistinguishable nature of the adsorbates. The grand canonical partition function is given by :\\\\mathcal{Z}(\\\\mu_A) = \\\\sum_{N_A=0}^{N_S} \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{N_A\\\\mu_A}{k_\\\\text{B} T}\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\zeta^{N_A}_L}{N_A!} \\\\, \\\\frac{N_S!}{(N_S - N_A)!}. \\\\mu_A is the chemical potential of an adsorbed molecule. As it has the form of binomial series, the summation is reduced to :\\\\mathcal{Z}(\\\\mu_A) = (1 + x)^{N_S}, where x = \\\\zeta_L \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu_A}{k_{\\\\rm B} T}\\\\right). The grand canonical potential is :\\\\Omega = -k_{\\\\rm B}T \\\\ln(\\\\mathcal{Z}) = -k_{\\\\rm B} T N_S \\\\ln(1 + x), based on which the average number of occupied sites is calculated : \\\\langle N_A \\\\rangle = - \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Omega}{\\\\partial \\\\mu_A}\\\\right)_{T, \\\\text{area}}, which gives the coverage :\\\\theta_A = \\\\frac{\\\\langle N_A \\\\rangle }{N_S} = \\\\frac{x}{1 + x}. Now, invoking the condition that the system is in equilibrium, that is, the chemical potential of the adsorbed molecules is equal to that of the molecules in gas phase, we have 493x493px : \\\\mu_A = \\\\mu_\\\\text{g}, The chemical potential of an ideal gas is :\\\\mu_\\\\text{g} = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\partial A_\\\\text{g}}{\\\\partial N} \\\\right)_{T,V} where A_g = - k_{\\\\rm B} T \\\\ln Z_g is the Helmholtz free energy of an ideal gas with its partition function :Z_g = \\\\frac{q^N}{N!}. q is the partition function of a single particle in the volume of V (only consider the translational freedom here). :q=V \\\\left( \\\\frac{2\\\\pi m k_{\\\\rm B} T }{h^2} \\\\right)^{3/2}. We thus have \\\\mu_g = -k_{\\\\rm B} T \\\\ln (q/N), where we use Stirling's approximation. Plugging \\\\mu_g to the expression of x, we have :\\\\frac{\\\\theta_A}{1 - \\\\theta_A} = x = \\\\zeta_L \\\\frac{N}{q} which gives the coverage :\\\\theta_A = \\\\frac{\\\\zeta_L/(q/N)}{1+\\\\zeta_L/(q/N)} By defining :P_0 = \\\\frac{k_\\\\text{B}T}{\\\\zeta_L} \\\\left( \\\\frac {2 \\\\pi m k_\\\\text{B} T}{h^2} \\\\right)^{3/2} and using the identity PV=N k_{\\\\rm B} T, finally, we have : \\\\theta_A = \\\\frac {P}{P + P_0}. It is plotted in the figure alongside demonstrating that the surface coverage increases quite rapidly with the partial pressure of the adsorbants, but levels off after P reaches P0. =Competitive adsorption= The previous derivations assumes that there is only one species, A, adsorbing onto the surface. This section considers the case when there are two distinct adsorbates present in the system. Consider two species A and B that compete for the same adsorption sites. The following assumptions are applied here: # All the sites are equivalent. # Each site can hold at most one molecule of A or one molecule of B, but not both. # There are no interactions between adsorbate molecules on adjacent sites. As derived using kinetical considerations, the equilibrium constants for both A and B are given by : \\\\frac{[A_\\\\text{ad}]}{p_A\\\\,[S]} = K^A_\\\\text{eq} and : \\\\frac{[B_\\\\text{ad}]}{p_B\\\\,[S]} = K^B_\\\\text{eq}. The site balance states that the concentration of total sites [S0] is equal to the sum of free sites, sites occupied by A and sites occupied by B: :[S_0] = [S] + [A_\\\\text{ad}] + [B_\\\\text{ad}]. Inserting the equilibrium equations and rearranging in the same way we did for the single-species adsorption, we get similar expressions for both Œ∏A and Œ∏B: :\\\\theta_A = \\\\frac{K^A_\\\\text{eq}\\\\,p_A}{1 + K^A_\\\\text{eq}\\\\,p_A + K^B_\\\\text{eq}\\\\,p_B}, :\\\\theta_B = \\\\frac{K^B_\\\\text{eq}\\\\,p_B}{1 + K^A_\\\\text{eq}\\\\,p_A + K^B_\\\\text{eq}\\\\,p_B}. =Dissociative adsorption= The other case of special importance is when a molecule D2 dissociates into two atoms upon adsorption. Here, the following assumptions would be held to be valid: # D2 completely dissociates to two molecules of D upon adsorption. # The D atoms adsorb onto distinct sites on the surface of the solid and then move around and equilibrate. # All sites are equivalent. # Each site can hold at most one atom of D. # There are no interactions between adsorbate molecules on adjacent sites. Using similar kinetic considerations, we get :\\\\frac{[D_\\\\text{ad}]}{p^{1/2}_{D_2}[S]} = K^D_\\\\text{eq}. The 1/2 exponent on pD2 arises because one gas phase molecule produces two adsorbed species. Applying the site balance as done above, :\\\\theta_D = \\\\frac{(K^D_\\\\text{eq}\\\\,p_{D_2})^{1/2}}{1 + (K^D_\\\\text{eq}\\\\,p_{D_2})^{1/2}}. Entropic considerations The formation of Langmuir monolayers by adsorption onto a surface dramatically reduces the entropy of the molecular system. This conflicts with the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy will increase in an isolated system. This implies that either another locally active force is stronger than the thermodynamic potential, or that our expression of the entropy of the system is incomplete. To find the entropy decrease, we find the entropy of the molecule when in the adsorbed condition. :S = S_\\\\text{configurational} + S_\\\\text{vibrational}, :S_\\\\text{conf} = k_{\\\\rm B} \\\\ln \\\\Omega_\\\\text{conf}, : \\\\Omega_\\\\text{conf} = \\\\frac{N_S!}{N!

On the other hand, the entropy of a molecule of an ideal gas is :\\\\frac {S_\\\\text{gas}}{N k_\\\\text{B}} = \\\\ln\\\\left( \\\\frac{k_\\\\text{B} T}{P \\\\lambda^3} \\\\right) + 5/2, where \\\\lambda is the thermal de Broglie wavelength of the gas molecule. Disadvantages of the model The Langmuir adsorption model deviates significantly in many cases, primarily because it fails to account for the surface roughness of the adsorbent. Rough inhomogeneous surfaces have multiple site-types available for adsorption, with some parameters varying from site to site, such as the heat of adsorption. Moreover, specific surface area is a scale dependent quantity and no single true value exists for this parameter. Thus, the use of alternative probe molecules will often result in different obtained numerical values for surface area, rendering comparison problematic. The model also ignores adsorbate/adsorbate interactions. Experimentally, there is clear evidence for adsorbate/adsorbate interactions in heat of adsorption data. There are two kinds of adsorbate/adsorbate interactions: direct interaction and indirect interaction. Direct interactions are between adjacent adsorbed molecules, which could make adsorbing near another adsorbate molecule more or less favorable and greatly affects high-coverage behavior. In indirect interactions, the adsorbate changes the surface around the adsorbed site, which in turn affects the adsorption of other adsorbate molecules nearby. Modifications The modifications try to account for the points mentioned in above section like surface roughness, inhomogeneity, and adsorbate-adsorbate interactions. =Two-Mechanism Langmuir-Like Equation (TMLLE)= Also known as the two site langmuir equation. This equation describes the adsorption of an adsorbate species on two or more distinct types of adsorption sites. Each binding site can be described with its own langmuir expression as long as the adsorption on each binding site type is independent from the rest. q_{total} = \\\\frac{q_{1}^{max} . K_{1} . a_{2}^{b}}{1+K_{1} . a_{2}^{b}} + \\\\frac{q_{2}^{max} . K_{2} . a_{2}^{b}}{1+K_{2} . a_{2}^{b}} + ...... q_{total}: total amount adsorbed at a given adsorbate concentration q_{1}^{max}: maximum capacity of site type 1 q_{2}^{max}: maximum capacity of site type 2 K_{1}: Equilibrium (affinity) constant of site type 1 K_{2}: Equilibrium (affinity) constant of site type 2 a_{2}^{b}: adsorbate activity in solution at equilibrium This equation works well for adsorption of some drug molecules to activated carbon in which some adsorbate molecules interact with hydrogen bonding while others interact with a different part of the surface via hydrophobic interactions (Hydrophobic effect). The equation was modified to account for the hydrophobic effect Modified Langmuir-like Model for Modeling the Adsorption from Aqueous Solutions by Activated Carbons Kirk A. VanDer Kamp, Dongmei Qiang, Aktham Aburub, and Dale Eric Wurster Langmuir 2005 21 (1), 217-224 DOI: 10.1021/la040093o: q_{total} = \\\\frac{q_{1}^{max} . K_{1} . a_{2}^{b}}{1+K_{1} . a_{2}^{b}} + q_{HB} The hydrophobic effect is independent of concentration since K_{2} . a_{2}^{b} >> 1. Therefore the capacity of the adsorbent for hydrophobic interactions ( q_{HB}) can be calculated =Freundlich adsorption isotherm= The Freundlich isotherm is the most important multisite adsorption isotherm for rough surfaces. : \\\\theta_A = \\\\alpha_F\\\\,p^{C_F} where Œ±F and CF are fitting parameters. This equation implies that if one makes a log-log plot of adsorption data, the data will fit a straight line. The Freundlich isotherm has two parameters while Langmuir's equations has only one: as a result, it often fits the data on rough surfaces better than the Langmuir's equations. However, the Freundlich equation is unique; consequently, if the data fit the equation, it is only likely, but not proved, that the surface is heterogeneous. The heterogeneity of the surface can be confirmed with calorimetery. Homogeneous surfaces (or heterogeneous surfaces that exhibit homogeneous adsorption (single site)) have a constant \\\\Delta H of adsorption as a function of % sites occupied. On the other hand, heterogenous adsorption (multi-site) have a variable \\\\Delta H of adsorption depending on the percent of sites occupied. When the adsorbate pressure (or concentration) are low, high energy sites will be occupied; and as the pressure (or concentration) increases, the lesser energy sites will be occupied resulting in a lower \\\\Delta H of adsorption. A related equation is the Toth equation. Rearranging the Langmuir equation, one can obtain: :\\\\theta_A = \\\\frac{p_A}{\\\\frac{1}{K_{eq}^A} + p_A} Toth modified this equation by adding two parameters, Œ±T0 and CT0 to formulate the Toth equation: :\\\\theta^{C_{T_0}} = \\\\frac {\\\\alpha_{T_0}\\\\,p_A^{C_{T_0}}}{\\\\frac{1}{K_{eq}^A} + p_A^{C_{T_0}}} =Temkin adsorption isotherm= This isotherm takes into account indirect adsorbate-adsorbate interactions on adsorption isotherms. Temkin noted experimentally that heats of adsorption would more often decrease than increase with increasing coverage. The heat of adsorption ŒîHad is defined as: :\\\\frac{[A_{ad}]}{p_A\\\\,[S]} = K^A_{eq} \\\\propto \\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\Delta G_{ad}/RT} = \\\\mathrm{e}^{\\\\Delta S_{ad}/R}\\\\,\\\\mathrm{e}^{-\\\\Delta H_{ad}/RT} He derived a model assuming that as the surface is loaded up with adsorbate, the heat of adsorption of all the molecules in the layer would decrease linearly with coverage due to adsorbate-adsorbate interactions: :\\\\Delta H_{ad} = \\\\Delta H^0_{ad}\\\\,(1-\\\\alpha_T\\\\,\\\\theta) where Œ±T is a fitting parameter. Assuming the Langmuir Adsorption isotherm still applied to the adsorbed layer, K_{eq}^A is expected to vary with coverage, as follows: :K^A_{eq} = K^{A,0}_{eq} \\\\mathrm{e}^{(\\\\Delta H^0_{ad}\\\\,(1-\\\\alpha_T\\\\,\\\\theta)/ k\\\\,T)} Langmuir's isotherm can be rearranged to this form: :K^A_{eq}\\\\,p_A = \\\\frac{\\\\theta }{1-\\\\theta} Substituting the expression of the equilibrium constant and taking the natural logarithm: :\\\\ln (K^{A,0}_{eq}\\\\,p_A) = \\\\frac{-\\\\Delta H^0_{ad} \\\\, \\\\alpha_T \\\\, \\\\theta}{k\\\\,T} + \\\\ln \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\theta}{1-\\\\theta}\\\\right) =BET equation= Brunauer's model of multilayer adsorption, that is, a random distribution of sites covered by one, two, three, etc., adsorbate molecules. Brunauer, Emmett and Teller derived the first isotherm for multilayer adsorption. It assumes a random distribution of sites that are empty or that are covered with by one monolayer, two layers and so on, as illustrated alongside. The main equation of this model is: :\\\\frac{[A]}{S_0} = \\\\frac{c_B \\\\, x_B}{(1-x_B)\\\\,[1 + (c_B - 1)\\\\,x_B]} where x_B = p_A\\\\,K_m, \\\\qquad c_B = \\\\frac{K_1}{K_m} and [A] is the total concentration of molecules on the surface, given by: :[A] = \\\\sum^{\\\\infty}_{i=1} i\\\\,[A]_i = \\\\sum^{\\\\infty}_{i=1}i \\\\, K_1 \\\\, K^{i-1}_m \\\\, p^i_A \\\\, [A]_0 where K_i = \\\\frac{[A]_i}{p_A\\\\,[A]_{i-1}} in which [A]0 is the number of bare sites, and [A]i is the number of surface sites covered by i molecules.  Adsorption of a binary liquid on a solid  This section describes the surface coverage when the adsorbate is in liquid phase and is a binary mixture For ideal both phases - no lateral interactions, homogeneous surface - the composition of a surface phase for a binary liquid system in contact with solid surface is given by a classic Everett isotherm equation (being a simple analogue of Langmuir equation), where the components are interchangeable (i.e. \\"1\\" may be exchanged to \\"2\\") without change of eq. form: ::x_1^s \\\\, = \\\\, \\\\frac{Kx_1^l}{1+(K-1)x_1^l} where the normal definition of multicomponent system is valid as follows : ::\\\\sum_{i=1}^{k} x^s_i =1 \\\\,\\\\,\\\\sum_{i=1}^{k} x^l_i =1 By simple rearrangement, we get ::x_1^s \\\\, = \\\\, \\\\frac{K[x_1^l/(1-x_1^l)]}{1+K[x_1^l/(1-x_1^l)]} This equation describes competition of components \\"1\\" and \\"2\\".

It stars his brother Dhanush, along with newcomer Richa Gangopadhyay, and features music scored by G. V. Prakash Kumar while the cinematography was handled by Ramji. Mayakkam Enna depicts the story of an aspiring wildlife photographer and his struggles in life. The film, produced and distributed by Gemini Film Circuit, was released on 25 November 2011. after originally being slated to air on the same day as Osthe.. The film was also dubbed and released in Telugu as Mr.Karthik.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCG47dZxNS0 Plot Karthik Swaminathan (Dhanush), referred to as 'Genius' by his friends, is a freelance photographer who aspires to become a wildlife photographer like Madhesh Krishnasamy (Raviprakash). His friends Sunder Ramesh (Sunder Ramu), Shankar (Mathivanan Rajendran), Padmini (Pooja Devariya), and Vindhya (Shilpi Kiran) support him and his sister after the death of their parents. One day, Sunder introduces Yamini (Richa Gangopadhyay) as his girlfriend to Karthik and his friends. On their first meeting, Karthik and Yamini have a bitter experience but slowly develop a special bond. Karthik tries to stay away from Yamini since he does not want to break his friend's heart, but a sequence of events brings them closer. Eventually, Sunder's father arranges for Karthik and Yamini to be married. After their wedding, Karthik learns that Madhesh had used a photograph that he had taken to win a national award. After this incident, he turns into a physically abusive alcoholic, and people start doubting his sanity and his mental health is somewhat affected. Yamini supports him, hoping that he will succeed one day. Days later, Karthik beats Yamini leading to Yamini's miscarriage, after which she stops talking to him. This makes Karthik come to terms with reality, and he mends his ways. He finally gets a break and becomes a professional wildlife photographer, and one of his photographs gets nominated for an International Photography Award, which he wins. On this occasion, Karthik thanks everyone for their support and Yamini for her faith in him and declares his love for her. Yamini finally relents and talks to Karthik as the film ends.

The title was finally changed to Mayakkam Enna from 'Idhu Maalai Nerathu Mayakkam' in August 2011, with reports suggesting that Dhanush would sport four different looks in the film. Selvaraghavan has since made it clear that the film has a totally different script from the film that had been shelved. It was said that Dhanush would be seen in various stages, as a boy just out of his teenage to an old man. Yuvan Shankar Raja replaced G.V.Prakash Kumar as music composer in the film, with the latter reporting it was due to \\"money and time issues\\". However, in a sensational turn, G.V.Prakash Kumar was assigned again as composer after Yuvan Shankar Raja moved out of the project as he was busy with other commitments and could not give priority to Selvaraghavan, who was in rush to complete the film and move over to his next project, Vishwaroopam. On 24 May 2011, it was announced that Selvaraghavan was ousted from the project. Soundtrack The soundtrack, composed by G. V. Prakash Kumar in his second collaboration with Selvaraghavan (after Aayirathil Oruvan), was released on 19 September 2011 at Radio Mirchi's Chennai station. The soundtrack has received generally positive reviews. Behindwoods commented it was \\"intoxicating enough\\", giving 3.5 out of 5. Reception The film received positive reviews from critics and audience. CNN-IBN wrote that Selvaraghavan had \\"succeeded in presenting a sensitive and engaging movie\\". The Times of India gave 3.5 out of 5, citing: \\"...with Mayakkam Enna he [Dhanush] proves why he is one of the best actors around\\". Deccan Chronicle gave 3.5 out of 5 and stated that it had a \\"fresh appeal and is straight from the heart without any clich√©d frills\\". The New Indian Express wrote: \\"A sensitively crafted screenplay, deft narration, stunning vignettes and montages, and a brilliant performance by the lead pair, makes Mayakkam Enna a fascinating watch\\". Deccan Herald wrote that it was \\"entertaining and worth a watch\\". NDTV stated it was a film \\"with soul and worth a watch\\". In regard to Dhanush's performance, it wrote: \\"His myriad emotions elevate the movie to a great extent\\". The review in The Hindu says: \\"Selvaraghavan knows where his potential lies and has tapped it suitably.\\" Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff gave the film 3 out of 5 and wrote: \\"[It] has a brilliant first half but the film looses the steam in the second half\\". Sify claimed: \\"Simplistic story with a hard hitting impact, Mayakkam Enna will stay with you\\". Behindwoods rated 3.5/5 and called it \\"emotionally rich\\" and an \\"inebriating experience by itself\\".

Biography Map of the Byzantine‚ÄìPersian frontier. AdarmahƒÅn is recorded as a marzbƒÅn (general of a frontier province, \\"margrave\\"), probably of Nisibis, by the Syriac historian John of Ephesus.. He was posted at Nisibis in 573, when the Persian king, Khosrau I (r. 531‚Äì579), sent him at the head of an army to invade the Roman province of Syria. He devastated the province, sacked the city of Apamea, capturing several thousand prisoners, and defeated a small Roman force under general Magnus.; ; . In 577, he raided the Roman province of Osrhoene, but withdrew at the approach of a strong Roman army under general Justinian.. In 580, the East Roman general Maurice advanced with an army along the river Euphrates toward the Sassanid capital, Ctesiphon. In response, Adarmahan was ordered to begin operations in northern Mesopotamia (581), threatening the Roman army's supply line and forcing Maurice to stop and withdraw his army north.. Adarmahan pillaged Osrhoene, and was successful in capturing its capital, Edessa. Then he marched his army toward Callinicum on the Euphrates. There, however, he was met by Maurice and his army, and suffered a minor defeat which caused him to retreat.; . In June of the next year (582), Adarmahan suffered a heavy defeat by Maurice near Constantina, barely escaping the field, while his co-commander Tamkhosrau was killed.; . Thereafter, Adarmahan disappears from history.

An electrical contractor is different from an electrician; an electrician is an individual tradesman and an electrical contractor is a business person or company that employs electricians. Both usually hold licenses and insurances to properly and safely operate a business, protecting the employees and home owners/business owners from insurance liabilities. These requirements vary from state to state. Electricians may work for an electrical contractor, or directly for individuals or companies.  Industry classifications  Electrical contractors are generally classified by three major types of work performed. * \\"Outside\\" or \\"line\\" contractors are responsible for high-voltage power transmission and distribution lines. Line contractors build and maintain the infrastructure required to transport electricity generated at a power plant through a series of high-voltage lines and substations before it is used to power facilities, buildings, and homes. * \\"Inside\\" electrical contractors provide electricity to any structure within a property's boundary lines, including outdoor lighting or substations. Under current construction specification guidelines, \\"inside\\" electrical contractors can serve as prime contractors for all electrical and cabling design, installation, and maintenance for commercial, institutional, and residential buildings. Projects also include Database Centers/Infrastructure and Pharmaceutical Work. * \\"Integrated building systems\\" (IBS) or \\"Voice/Data/Video\\" (VDV) electrical contractors work primarily with low-voltage installations such as back-up power, climate controls, wireless networks, energy-efficient lighting, telecommunications, fiber optics, and security systems. IBS contractors are particularly skilled at integrating these system controls to work together for maximum energy efficiency and building performance.  Industry jobs  Electrical contractors employ workers in many capacities, determined by their level of training and experience. Some common jobs include: * Apprentice Electrician ‚Äî Receives on-the-job training and classroom instruction from licensed journeymen or master electricians about how to install, modify, repair, and maintain power and lighting systems. Most apprentice programs last 3 to 5 years and apprentices earn wages during this training period. * Journeyman Electrician ‚Äî Installs, modifies, repairs, and maintains power and lighting systems. Reads blueprints, terminates cable, and installs and troubleshoots control wiring from drawings. Has completed the apprentice program and holds a journeyman's license (according to state requirements) and supervises apprentices. * Estimator ‚Äî Calculates a project's duration and cost, including materials, overhead, and labor. This estimate is often submitted as a bid on a project and serves as a scheduling and budget guideline as the project proceeds. * Project Supervisor ‚Äî Oversees workforce to encourage safe and high-quality installations. Monitors progress to meet project deadlines. Submits required reports and forms.  Trade associations  =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, the two main trade associations are the Electrical Contractors' Association, covering England, Northern Ireland and Wales, and SELECT - the Electrical Contractors' Association for Scotland. The main certification bodies are the National Inspection Council for Electrical Installation Contracting and Elecsa. =United States= The National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) is the largest trade association in the electrical contracting industry, with about 4500 members. NECA publishes an industry magazine, and sponsors an annual convention and trade show. Independent Electrical Contractors (IEC) is another trade association for electrical contractors with 70 chapters across the U.S. They provide education and training via a U.S. Department of Labor recognized apprenticeship program. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers organizes and represents over 700,000 members, and provides training and apprenticeship programs.  Safety  Electrical contractors in the United States are required to follow National Electrical Code (NEC) to ensure systems work in a safe manner.NKAPC The NEC is a widely adopted model code for the installation of electrical components and systems, designed to safeguard persons and property from hazards arising from the use of electricity. While these are the default minimum requirements and guidelines, some states modify selected areas of the NEC code to suit their specific circumstances.https://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&q;=cache:iPNLQIVdeFYJ:www.dca.state.ga.us/development/constructioncodes/programs/documents/NEC2009Amendments_effective.pdf+national+electric+code&hl;=en‚â∑=us&pid;=bl&srcid;=ADGEEShpQCT- JX6xBOv_pHrRjdxsfGCbN-S8Delg0b-UwgvXVxlvxqQTNm5xxbpUgx_vUsHFUu9DSz5UOKWGMswnRXX9tb8HAjWCWVP0T5hc7DKqVkoQRSXoio3MedKlb_wJfB5TVkqK&sig;=AFQjCNGTGmOKK1Co1O2Yg15hknhijIcxrA  References  External links *National Electrical Contractors Association website Category:Electric power Category:Electrical trades Category:Electrical wiring ","title":"Electrical contractor"},{"id":"20114269","text":"Royal Engineer tunnelling companies were specialist units of the Corps of Royal Engineers within the British Army, formed to dig attacking tunnels under enemy lines during the First World War. The stalemate situation in the early part of the war led to the deployment of tunnel warfare. After the first German Empire attacks on 21 December 1914, through shallow tunnels underneath no man's land and exploding ten mines under the trenches of the Indian Sirhind Brigade, the British began forming suitable units. In February 1915, eight Tunnelling Companies were created and operational in Flanders from March 1915. By mid-1916, the British Army had around 25,000 trained tunnellers, mostly volunteers taken from coal mining communities. Almost twice that number of \\"attached infantry\\" worked permanently alongside the trained miners acting as 'beasts of burden'. From the spring of 1917 the whole war became more mobile, with grand offensives at Arras, Messines and Passchendaele. There was no longer a place for a tactic that depended upon total stasis for its employment. The tactics and counter-tactics required deeper and deeper tunnelling, hence more time and more stable front lines were also required, so offensive and defensive military mining largely ceased. Underground work continued, with the tunnellers concentrating on deep dugouts for troop accommodation, a tactic used particularly in the Battle of Arras. Background Example of a mine gallery with timber roof support In siege warfare, tunnelling is a long-held tactic for breaching and breaking enemy defences. The Greek historian Polybius, in his Histories, described accounts of mining during Philip V of Macedon's siege of the town of Prinassos; there is also a graphic account of mining and counter-mining at the Roman siege of Ambracia. Mining was a method used in siege warfare in ancient China from at least the Warring States (481‚Äì221 BC) period forward.Ebrey, 29. In 1215 during the First Barons' War, John, King of England laid siege to Rochester Castle. Eventually, he ordered his troops to dig a tunnel under the south tower, which they held up with pit props. After the tunnellers lit the props, the tower fell down, ending the siege even though the castle's main walls remained standing. In 1346, Edward III of England requested that miners from the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire accompany his expedition to France, during the first part of the Hundred Years' War between England and France. The Corps of Royal Engineers were formed in 1717. In 1770, the Company of Soldier Artificers formed a specialist tunnelling troop in Gibraltar to dig defensive positions into the Rock. During the Siege of Lucknow in 1857, Royal Engineers were asked to undertake counter-mining. The use of mines filled with explosives as an offensive weapon for trench warfare was pioneered during the American Civil War, where a large mine was exploded by Union forces during the Battle of the Crater. First World War formation French Army Trench in northeastern France By the end of May 1915, a continuous opposed pair of defence-in-depth trench earthworks with no vulnerable flanks, stretched from the North Sea coast to neutral Switzerland. With both sides equally well dug-in and deploying comparable troop numbers and armaments, neither was to prove strong enough to force a decisive breakthrough. The resultant static warfare meant that tunnelling saw a brief resurgence as a military tactic. As in siege warfare, mining was possible due to the nature of the fighting. Secondly, the ground on the Western Front was a prime candidate for underground warfare. Although the British were equipped with Royal Engineers who were trained in carrying out sapping, mining and tunnelling operations, there was no core team of specialist skills. =Request and proposal= Major Sir John Norton- Griffiths MP, founder of the Royal Engineers tunnelling companies Even before it became apparent that the Germans were mining to a planned system, the commanding officer of the IV Corps, Sir Henry Rawlinson, requested the establishment on 3 December 1914, of a special battalion to assist with mining duties. Towards the end of 1914, the civil engineering company of Member of Parliament and British Army Major, John Norton-Griffiths, was working on sewerage renewal contracts in Liverpool and Manchester. The relatively small- bore tunnels were being driven by a manual technique known as clay-kicking. Only useful in firm clay soils, the man doing the digging sat with his back supported by a wooden frame, with his feet pointing towards the cutting face. With a spade-like tool he dug out the clay, passing the spoil over-head to one of his mates for disposal at the rear. In early December 1914, Norton- Griffiths wrote to the War Office suggesting that the technique would be useful within the war effort for attack, spying or for intercepting German tunnels coming in the opposite direction. He concluded by asking to be allowed to take a group of his \\"moles\\" to France where if the soil was right, they could quickly undermine enemy positions. His letter was filed. On 20 December 1914, by digging shallow tunnels under no man's land, German sappers placed eight mines beneath the positions of the Indian Sirhind Brigade in Givenchy- l√®s-la-Bass√©e. Following their simultaneous detonation, an infantry attack resulted in the loss of the entire company of 800 men. =Kitchener responds= Following further attacks, it was evident by January 1915 that the Germans were mining to a planned system. As the British had failed to develop suitable counter-tactics or listening devices, Sir John French, commander of the British Expeditionary Force, wrote to the Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, describing the seriousness of the German mining situation. Norton- Griffiths received a telegram on 12 February 1915, instructing him to report to the War Office. On his arrival, he was shown into Kitchener's private offices, There, Kitchener showed him French's letter. Kitchener then asked Norton-Griffiths for his advice. Using a coal shovel from the room's fire grate, Norton-Griffiths sat on the floor and gave a demonstration of \\"clay- kicking.\\" Impressed but sceptical, Kitchener asked Norton-Griffiths to travel that day to France to communicate his method to the commanders there, and confirm the suitability of the Flanders soil. If positive, he would then raise a suitable battalion of \\"moles\\", as Norton-Griffiths had named his new teams, the same name as their civil engineering counterparts. Arriving with two of his employees at the GHQ Saint-Omer office of the Engineer-in-Chief (E-in-C), Brigadier George Henry Fowke, on 13 February, Norton-Griffiths gave another demonstration of \\"clay-kicking.\\" A sceptical Fowke instructed his assistant, Colonel Harvey, to take Norton-Griffiths and his employees to Army and Corps headquarters on 14 February, to see what the Corps of Royal Engineers thought of the idea. In an early public relations exercise, on 14 February, Norton- Griffiths got Colonel Harvey to stop at four headquarters ‚Äì Army, Corps, Division and Brigade. At each briefing, Norton-Griffiths repeated his demonstration. On arrival at the front line, (a mile from where the first German mine had exploded the previous December), they confirmed the excellent conditions of the clay-based soil and returned to St Omer via the four headquarters to communicate their findings. The following day, the team held further meetings in St Omer, concluding with a meeting between Norton- Griffiths, Fowke and Sir John French, the C-in-C, for a personal explanation. Fowke gave his agreement to a trial to which French agreed, and the three set out a structure for what were to be called tunnelling companies, rather than Norton-Griffiths' preference for 'moles': a symbol which many of the tunnelling companies would later adopt as their unit sign. In a meeting with Lord Kitchener on 17 February, he reported on his visit to France and the agreement of Collins and Fowke to form trial tunnelling companies. Norton- Griffiths pointed out that to deploy the units at the speed which Lord Kitchener had suggested, would require the recruitment of civilians, who could not undergo basic military training to enable their immediate deployment to the front line. Kitchener's staff were highly sceptical of the proposal, but using his carte-blanche skill to cull such skilled men from regular infantry units, Norton-Griffiths won his argument. The same day, 17 February, British sappers at Hill 60 near Ypres blew a small mine which they had taken over from the French, but without great effect. The Germans retaliated with a small mine at Zwarteleen, but were driven out of the British positions. On 21 February, however, they blew a large mine nearby, killing forty-seven men and ten officers of the 16th Lancers. In mid-March the Germans blew another large mine at Zwarteleen, creating a deep crater and damaging their own lines in the process. =First tunnelling companies= Norton Griffiths travelled to Manchester on 18 February and closed down one of his tunnelling contracts, making 18 staff redundant. The following day the War Office gave its approval to the Royal Engineers tunnelling company scheme. On the same day, 18 formerly redundant Manchester men turned up in Chatham to be enrolled, clothed and turned into Royal Engineers. One of the most rapid acts of the First World War, men who were working underground as civilians on 17 February, were working underground on the Western Front a mere four days later. The first nine Royal Engineer Tunnelling Companies, numbers 170 to 178, were each commanded by a regular RE officer ‚Äì they comprised: five officers and 269 sappers, aided by temporarily attached infantrymen as required, (which almost doubled the companies' number). Norton-Griffiths, in the rank of major, acted as a liaison officer between these units and the E-in-C's office in St Omer. Although able to select almost any soldier he wished, as he had predicted, Norton-Griffiths was quickly forced to recruit civilians. The new recruits in these units, aged anything up to 60, did not readily conform to military discipline and Norton-Griffiths' skills as a politician and as an engineer were called on in recruiting the men he needed and integrating them into the military environment. His judgement of people was remarkably accurate, he very rarely made a mistake in selecting men for a commission. The deployment of the first eight units led to the introduction of the tunnelling method that allowed the British to dig tunnels at a rate of per day, compared to the Germans' . =First action: Hill 60, Ypres Salient= The first attack of the newly formed tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers was carried out by 173rd Tunnelling Company. First deployed in the Ypres Salient with the 28th Division, the tunnelers laid six mines by 10 April 1915. These mines (together with others that were unfinished) were filled with around of Ammonal explosives, the resulting explosions ripping the heart out of Hill 60 over a period of about 10 seconds. The effect was a mini-earthquake that split the ground under the entire hill, white flames shot into the sky. Concrete pillboxes and soldiers occupying them came down in all directions away. The explosion resulted in a deep crater, with surrounding trenches sandwiched shut so fast that soldiers were crushed, still in their standing positions. The Germans all around were crying with fear. Many retreated in terror, the-then tunnel master, Otto von F√ºsslein, was castigated, although the position was quickly recaptured a few days later. The action showed the importance of the necessity for a counter-offensive against aggressive German mining on the British lines. Having proven the system, Norton-Griffiths left the company and returned to London in April 1916 and his duties as an MP. He left GHQ with his rough plan of August 1915 for extensive mining on the Messines front, which formed the framework on which mines were used at the Battle of Messines two years later. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his efforts, mentioned in dispatches three times and promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in 1916. =Expansion= The success of the Tunnelling Companies led to mining being made a separate branch of the new E-in-C's office, which was under Major-General S.R. Rice and the appointment of an Inspector of Mines at GHQ. The second group of tunnelling companies were formed from Welsh miners from the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the Monmouthshire Regiment, who were attached to the 1st Northumberland Field Company, Royal Engineers, a Territorial unit. Twelve Tunnelling Companies were ultimately formed in 1915 and one more in 1916. A Canadian troop was formed from men on the battlefield, plus two other companies trained in Canada and then shipped to France. Three Australian and one New Zealand tunnelling companies were formed by March 1916. This resulted in 30 companies by the end of 1916, many made up of ex-miners. The establishment for a tunnelling company was set at 14 officers and 307 other ranks (ORs). Early in 1916 20 of the companies were to be raised to a higher establishment of 18 officers and 530 ORs, but none ever reached that strength; the other five remained on the original establishment.Watson & Rinaldi, pp. 49, 52. All of these companies were occupied on other underground work such as the digging of subways, saps (a narrow trench dug to approach enemy trenches), cable trenches, underground chambers for such things as signals and medical services, as well as offensive and defensive mining. =Methodology= Both sides deployed tunnelling, with the German lead quickly followed by the British follow-up. The result was a labyrinth of tunnels within a cat and mouse-like game of tunnelling, counter-tunnelling and counter tactics. As the tactics and counter tactics deployed against each other became less and less effective, the depth at which the tunnels needed to be dug became deeper and deeper and hence more dangerous. The result was a greater time to dig, resulting in a greater vulnerability to both leakage of information and tunnel collapse, and a higher loss of lives in the most hideous of circumstances: entombment, drowning, gassing or obliteration in cramped and claustrophobic galleries beneath no man's land. =Recruitment= To make the tunnels safer and quicker to deploy, the British Army enlisted experienced coal miners, many outside their nominal recruitment policy. The desperate need for skilled men saw notices requesting volunteer tunnellers posted in collieries, mineral mines and quarries across South Wales, Scotland and the Northeast of England covering Derbyshire, County Durham, Nottinghamshire and Yorkshire. In addition, specialist tin miners were also recruited from the Cornish mines mainly joining the 251st Company RE. To attract the tin miners, a per diem of six shillings a day was offered to underground miners, which was around double to that was being paid in the mines. The mining assistants who acted as 'beasts of burden' were often made up of \\"Bantams\\" - soldiers of below average height who had been rejected from regular units because they did not meet the height requirements. Upon the declaration of war in August 1914, William Hackett applied and was turned down three times at the age of 41 by the York and Lancaster Regiment. On 25 October 1915, despite having been diagnosed with a heart condition, he was enlisted and sent for two weeks basic training at Chatham, joining 172nd Tunnelling Company. =Digging= As tunnels were vulnerable to attack, the entrances were a closely guarded secret. With electricity in short supply in the frontline, tunnellers were forced to work by candlelight. Operating in near silence to avoid detection, the tunnels were cold, cramped and often up to a foot deep in freezing water. Tunnel entrances were most often at the bottom of deep shafts. From here, using the clay- kicking technique, the tunnels were aligned and given direction by the simple use of candlelight. They were built on a slight uphill gradient of between 1:100 and 1:50 to keep them as dry as possible. This meant that they were also vulnerable to the accumulation of gas at the digging face. A clay-kicking team typically consisted of three men: a \\"Kicker\\" who worked at the face, a \\"Bagger\\" who filled sandbags with the lumps of clay spoil, and a \\"Trammer\\" who transported the bags out of the gallery on a small, rubber-tyred trolley on rails. The trolley was also employed to bring timber in on the return journey. If the tunnel was long, the trammer was given extra assistants to speed the exit of spoil and intake of timber. The team was responsible for its own safety, and would insert a 'sett' of wooden supports every . As no nails or screws could be used due to noise, the 'setts' (consisting of a sole, two legs and a cap), were sawn with a rebated step, which, once trimmed into the clay, would expand with the absorbed water into a solid structure. =Working conditions= Working in cold, cramped conditions, miners worked in 6- or 12-hour rotating shifts. Miners were prone to illness, with high rates of trench foot and bad food disease, while fatigue compounded the situation, creating a high mortality rate. The miners also had to cope with difficult circumstances when they entered the mining tunnels. Often the tunnels were dark, small and flooded with water. Tunnellers were billeted quite a long way back from the front line, while a regular Royal Navy-style rum ration was issued to keep out the cold. Natural gases and gases given off as a result of explosions could ignite, poison or asphyxiate. The major problem gas for tunnellers was carbon monoxide, given off by all projectiles from shells to rifle bullets. With the use of experienced miners, came the use of \\"miners friends\\" in the form of mice and later small birds, such as canaries. With a high metabolic rate, they were readily susceptible to gas, and issued to the Tunnelling Companies as an official item. When gas was present, their unconsciousness would alert miners to the need to evacuate. Although many animals died, others would recover on the surface, with at least one company keeping a record of the gassings so that their creatures did not have to endure more than three instances before being pensioned off to an aviary. The role of the miners friends are honoured on the Scottish National War Memorial in Edinburgh. In extensive tunnelling systems, air-tight doors were introduced to control air flows. =Mine rescue= Such was the reliance on mining during the early stages of the war, that eventually mining-related casualties became so great that the War Office decided something had to be done about mine rescue. The skilled mining volunteers were particularly hard to replace. In one six-week period, one tunnelling company had 16 men killed; 48 sent to hospital; and 86 minor cases treated at the shaft head and returned to company billets. Another company suffered 12 men killed by gas; 28 sent to hospital in one month; 60 minor cases were retained with the unit. In response the affected mining units put out an urgent call for appropriate rescue equipment. Captain D Dale Logan was appointed advisor to GHQ in September 1915 on all matters connected with the health of the specially enlisted Tunnelling Companies. In June 1915, Lance Corporal Arthur B. Clifford was made solely responsible for mine safety training. Sent to the front to train 3000 mine- rescue troops in a month, there were only 36 sets of 'PROTO' breathing equipment available in the whole of the United Kingdom. Clifford was based with the Royal Engineers at Strazeele, with a sub-station at Berguette. This became the first Army Mine-Rescue School. Clifford was awarded the Meritorious Service Medal in 1917 for what he had achieved. From July 1916, under Logan's new organisation, the second Army Mine-Rescue School was established at Armenti√®res. This allowed the British to deploy a system of mines rescue, where no mining shaft was further than from a rescue station. Named after the kit they employed, Proto-men were hand-picked experienced miners, selected for coolness under pressure. Two men were on duty at all times, with additional access to 10 electric miners lamps, six canaries, four mobile cages, one saw, one hand axe, three life-lines, two mine stretchers, one trench stretcher, one Primus stove, two tins of caf√© au lait, six hot water bottles and six blankets. =Underground fighting= As a result of so much mining activity by both sides, detection and breakthrough into each other's tunnelling systems occurred frequently. The result was often the deployment of the emergency camouflet, a pre-prepared charge which was always ready in the British and Allied forces sectors when tunnelling was taking place. Vicious hand-to-hand fighting in the dark with picks, shovels and wood used as weapons might also take place. Although all miners were trained to use rifles, the restrictions of tunnel construction and the conditions of the tunnels where the miners had to operate often meant they could not be used. If the opposing side were unsuccessful in repelling an attack, then enemy tunnels could be used for short periods to observe enemy tunnelling activity and direction. Counter- mining =Listening= Plan for the British Peckham deep mine, one of the Mines in the Battle of Messines (1917), with German counter-mining efforts (shafts Ebbo, Emil and Ernst). Early tunnelling required a great deal of improvisation, as equipment was in short supply. This made tunnels shallow, the noise of digging being detectable using simple devices in the trenches, even amongst the gun-fire. In the trenches, soldiers found that driving a stick into the ground and holding the other end between their teeth enabled them to feel any underground vibration. Another method involved sinking a water-filled oil drum into the floor of the trench, with lookout soldiers taking turns to lower an ear into the water to listen for vibrations. Improvised methods later included Water Board inspector short-sticks, each with a single vibrating wire-type earphone attached, or using filled French water-bottles laid flat on their sides in pairs, so they could be listened-to through medical stethoscopes. Underground, within the tunnelling operations, side-shaft listening posts were deployed and manned by soldiers whose job entailed listening for indications that the enemy was tunnelling. Initially using just manual methods, the British were eventually equipped with the Geophone, which could detect noises up to away. Employing two Geophones, a listener was able to ascertain the direction of hostile activity by moving the sensors until sound levels were equal in both ears. A compass bearing was then taken. When gauging distance only, both earpieces were plugged into a single sensor; this was a skill only gained by experience. Deploying listeners in different tunnels in triangulation techniques, by the end of 1916 the scale of British tunnelling warfare had expanded to such an extent that there were not enough listeners to man every post; central listening stations were devised. Working electronically like a telephone exchange, the signals from up to 36 remote sensors (Tele-geophones and Seismomicrophones) could be distinguished and logged by just two men. =Underground tactics= Plan for the British Spanbroekmolen deep mine, one of the Mines in the Battle of Messines (1917), with German counter-mining efforts (shafts Erich, Ewald, Elsa and Frieda). The tunnellers developed counter tactics, which both sides deployed. The first was the use of large mines placed in one's own tunnels ‚Äì some actually dug towards enemy noise to create damage ‚Äì which when exploded would create fissures and cracks in the ground, making the ground either unsuitable for tunnelling or destroying existing tunnels and works. A small device, called the camouflet, created a localised underground chamber designed not to break the surface and form craters, but to destroy a strictly limited area of underground territory ‚Äì and its occupants. The second tactic, deployed when the enemy tunnel was too close to your existing works or trenches, was the deployment of rod-fed torpedo shaped camouflet charges. Effectively land mines on the end of long iron sticks, the technique was a defensive tactic against an immediate threat. Towards the end of the tunnel war, forces also deployed mines at greater depths, which, coupled with the use of listening devices, could be exploded away from friendly trenches as a defensive measure. British advantages The British tunnellers had three advantages over their German counterparts, the Pioniere: Firstly, the British used clay-kicking which was a virtually silent method of tunnelling. The Germans did not know of this technique, having not used it in their pre-war civil engineering, and thus used mattocks (a type of pick-axe) and other loud tools throughout the war. This made their tunnels more vulnerable to detection and attack. Secondly, the use of clay-kicking made the British four times as fast at tunnel digging as their German counterparts. Thirdly, British positions were most often located in low-lying areas, while German positions tended to be more elevated. Although this made the British more vulnerable to shelling, it also meant that British tunnellers had less of the soft quicksand-like 'Kemmel Sands' (known to the Germans as Schwimmsande), an integral component of the geological make-up of the ridges around Ieper (Ypres), to penetrate. While the bottom blue clay layer was virtually flat, as was the Kemmel Sands that sat on top of it, there was a dry strata which varied above this which created the geographical contours. This varying dry strata increased pressure on the Kemmel Sands, which unable to egress water below them, made them wet and unstable. When punctured, the Kemmel Sands would often \\"spout\\" under pressure, both water and solid material. Difficult to dig through and keep the mining wooden structure stable, the Germans, assuming that the British had the same instability problem, dug few tunnels until 1916. The British found an engineering solution by creating a metal tube through the Kemmel Sands. Sunk either through its own weight or by the use of hydraulic jacks, once the blue clay layer was hit, the tunnelling could again resume under wooden supports. In autumn of 1915, 172nd Tunnelling Company at St Eloi managed to sink shafts through the sandy clay at a depth of down to dry blue clay at a depth of , which was ideal for tunneling, from where they continued to drive galleries towards the German lines at a depth of . This constituted a major achievement in mining technique and gave the Royal Engineers a significant advantage over their German counterparts. The British used tube shafts from May 1915, a full year before the Germans, who when they did start to use metal and concrete tunnels, had lost the strategic advantage and were digging purely for defensive purposes. Operations La Boisselle mine crater, August 1916 (IWM Q 912) Troops passing Lochnagar Crater, October 1916 (IWM Q 1479) The Lochnagar Crater, one of the mines fired on the first day of the Somme Tunnelling companies were not popular amongst the ordinary troops. Knowing such a unit was nearby made them nervous: * Danger from above the ground (from the enemy) * Danger from below the ground (from their own and enemy tunnelling companies) * If the enemy knew a tunnelling company was in the area, it made the trench troops a more likely artillery target. This was further emphasised as the war developed with both sides using larger and larger mines, often deployed ever-closer to their own trenches. These were more likely not to be detonated on time, or if they did, shower debris over their own trenches and advancing troops, causing increased casualties. The first British mine to be detonated was by the 173rd Tunnelling Company at Hill 60 (10 April 1915). Mines were also used at The Bluff, St Eloi (six on 27 March 1916), the Battle of Aubers Ridge (May 1915); Hooge, Givenchy, Cuinchy and the Battle of Loos (September 1915). In June 1916, during the height of the underground war on the Western Front, British tunnellers fired 101 mines or camouflets, while German tunnellers fired 126 mines or camouflets. This amounts to a total of 227 mine explosions in one month ‚Äì one detonation every three hours. The last British deep mine of the First World War was fired by 251st Tunnelling Company at Givenchy (10 August 1917). =Hooge and Mont Sorrel= Royal Engineers tunnellers' grave The small village of Hooge in Flanders belonged to one of the easternmost sectors of the Ypres Salient, which made it the site of intense and sustained fighting between German and Allied forces. From 1914 the front line of the Salient ran through the Hooge area. There was almost constant fighting in the area over the next three years, and Hooge changed hands a number of times. The ch√¢teau at Hooge was used as the British divisional headquarters for the area for some time;Duffy, Michael firstworldwar.com 25 August 2002, accessed 16 February 2007 several senior officers from the 1st and 2nd Divisions were killed when the Ch√¢teau de Hooge was shelled on 31 October 1914.Commonwealth War Graves Commission, undated, accessed 16 February 2007 German forces attacked the ch√¢teau between 24 May and 3 June 1915 and despite the detonation of a mine by the 175th Tunnelling Company (operating with the 3rd Division) on 19 July, leaving a massive crater, took control of the ch√¢teau and the surrounding area on 30 July 1915.Battlefields 14‚Äì18, undated, accessed 16 February 2007 The ch√¢teau and the crater (craters being strategically important in relatively flat countryside), were taken by the British 6th Division on 9 August. It was reclaimed by the Germans on 16 June 1916 and retaken by the British on 31 July 1917 when the 8th Division managed to advance past it by about a mile. The Germans retook the site in April 1918 as part of the Spring Offensive but were expelled from the area by the British on 28 September as the offensive faltered. The chateau was completely destroyed along with the entire village; several large craters were blown over the course of the 1917 fighting.WWI Battlefields, undated, accessed 16 February 2007 =Battle of the Somme= The explosion of the mine beneath the Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt, 1 July 1916. Photo by Ernest Brooks. In the Somme sector of the Western Front, local but very fierce underground fighting had taken place in the winter of 1914 and spring of 1915 at La Boisselle, Fricourt, Bois Fran√ßais and Carnoy. As part of the Allied preparations for the Battle of the Somme (1 July ‚Äì 18 November 1916), the tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers made two major contributions to the opening attack: Firstly, they placed a number of mines beneath the German front lines, laid deep in the chalk and overcharged to throw up high lips for screening and to give advantage to the attackers when (or if) they captured them. Secondly, they prepared a series of shallow Russian saps from the British front line into no man's land, which would be opened at Zero Hour and allow the infantry to attack the German positions from a comparatively short distance. Thirdly, members of the 183rd company also dug a tunnel for a Livens Large Gallery Flame Projector, one of 4 installed in preparation for the battle. For the start of the battle on 1 July 1916, the Royal Engineers planned to fire a group of eight large and eleven small mines along the Somme front line.Battle of the Somme ‚Äì 1916, BBC History, accessed 7 July 2015. The most important of them were beneath Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt at Beaumont-Hamel, beneath a German field fortification known as Schwabenh√∂he just south of La Boisselle and three in a sector named The Tambour near Fricourt. The Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt mine, which consisted of of explosives, was the first to be detonated. This led to the successful filming of the explosion by British cinematographer Geoffrey Malins, who was filming the 29th Division's attack on that day. Despite their colossal size, the largest of the mines fired on 1 July 1916 failed to help sufficiently neutralise the German defences. At La Boisselle, the ruined village was meant to fall in 20 minutes, but by the end of the first day of the battle, it had not been taken while the III Corps divisions had lost more than . At Mash Valley, the attackers lost 5,100 men before noon, and at Sausage Valley near the crater of the Lochnagar mine, there were over 6,000 casualties ‚Äì the highest concentration on the entire battlefield. The III Corps' 34th Division suffered the worst losses of any unit that day. =Battle of Messines= Crater of the Caterpillar mine detonated as part of the Mines in the Battle of Messines (1917) View from the Kruisstraat craters towards the Spanbroekmolen crater, all detonated as part of the Mines in the Battle of Messines (1917) Spanbroekmolen crater in November 2009. It is also known as \\"Lone Tree Crater\\" or \\"Pool of Peace\\". In January 1917, General Sir Herbert Plumer, gave orders for a series of mines to be placed under the German lines in preparation for the Battle of Messines. These were not the first mines in the Ypres Salient. From 1915, British engineers started digging, but it was not until the winter of 1916 when they were joined by Canadian, Australian and New Zealand engineers, that mass tunnelling started under the German trenches. At St Eloi, six mines were detonated on 27 March 1916. At Hill 60, a gallery was started in summer 1915 and known as Berlin Tunnel. The 1st Australian Tunnelling Company took over mining operations at Hill 60 in November 1916, led in part by Captain Oliver Woodward. Twenty-six deep mines were eventually dug in preparation of the Battle of Messines in 1917, some up to long and up to deep, altogether containing 600 tonnes of ammonal explosive. To solve the problem of wet soil, the tunnels were dug in the layer of \\"blue clay\\", 80‚Äì120 feet (25‚Äì30 m) below the surface.Wolff, p. 88 The galleries dug in order to lay these mines eventually totalled over in length, and had been constructed in the face of tenacious German counter-mining.Liddell Hart, p. 331. On several occasions, German tunnellers were within yards of large British mine \\"chambers.\\" The mine at Petite Douve Farm was discovered by the Germans on 24 August 1916 and destroyed by a counter-mine.Wolff, p. 92 With doubts about the reliability of the system (some mines had been lying underground for over a year), soldiers waiting in the trenches had been warned that they could not depend absolutely on the mines working as planned, so their orders were to leave their trenches and attack whether the mines exploded or not. The explosion of the mines took place at 03:10 on 7 June 1917. Approximately 10,000 German troops were killed when the mines were simultaneously detonated, creating large craters and an explosion so loud it was heard by British Prime Minister David Lloyd George in his study in 10 Downing Street in London. There is even a report of an insomniac student hearing it in University College, Dublin. The evening before the attack, General Sir Charles Harington remarked to his staff, \\"Gentlemen, we may not make history tomorrow, but we shall certainly change the geography.\\" The largest of the mines at Messines was at St Eloi, dug by the 1st Canadian Tunnelling Company, consisting of of explosive. This allowed the capture of St Eloi by the British 41st Division. Another large mine was at Spanbroekmolen. Found and counter-mined by the Germans a few weeks before the attack, the British were forced to dig a second entrance tunnel into the already prepared explosive chamber, (which consisted of 41 tons of ammonal explosive below ground),Mallett, p. 116 to reconnect the detonation wires. Although tested fully just a few hours before the attack, officers used torch batteries to prove the circuits. As instructed, soldiers of the 36th (Ulster) Division had already left their trenches and begun to move across No-Man's Land when the mine exploded a few seconds late, leading to some being killed by falling debris. They are buried in Lone Tree Cemetery nearby. The \\"Lone Tree Crater\\" formed by the blast was approximately in diameter, and deep. Four mines close to Ploegsteert Wood (Birdcage 1‚Äì4) were not exploded as they were outside the attack area. The British intended to dismantle the remaining mines, but the Third Battle of Ypres delayed operations, after the Germans overran the group headquarters their location was lost. On 17 July 1955, a lightning strike set-off one of the remaining mines. There were no human casualties, but one cow was killed and some local property damage was sustained. The remaining mines with several tonnes of high explosive are still buried under the Belgian countryside. A memorial to the Australian mining troops killed at Hill 60 during the course of the war was later placed at the site. =Battle of Vimy Ridge= A preserved World War 1 fighting tunnel in the Vimy sector Between October 1915 and April 1917 an estimated 150 French, British and German charges were fired in this sector of the Western Front. The tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers progressively took over from the French between February and May 1916. The units active around Vimy were the 172nd, 175th, 176th, 182nd, 184th, 185th and 255th Tunnelling Companies. The British soon discovered that German tunnelling companies had taken advantage of the relative calm on the surface to build an extensive network of tunnels and deep mines from which they could attack French positions.Boire (2007) p. 59 The Royal Engineers immediately deployed tunnelling companies of the Royal Engineers along the front to combat the German mining operations. In response to increased British mining, German artillery and trench mortar fire intensified in early May 1916.Samuels pp. 200‚Äì202 After September 1916, when the Royal Engineers had constructed defensive galleries along most of the front line at Vimy, offensive mining largely ceased. By 1917, 19 crater groups existed along this section of the Western Front, each with several large craters.Boire (1992) p. 20 The British gallery network beneath Vimy Ridge grew to a length of . Before the Battle of Vimy Ridge (9‚Äì12 April 1917), the British tunnelling companies secretly laid a series of explosive charges under German positions in an effort to destroy surface fortifications before the assault.Boire (1992) pp. 22‚Äì23 The original plan had called for 17 mines and 9 Wombat charges to support the infantry attack, of which 13 (possibly 14) mines and 8 Wombat charges were eventually laid. In order to assess the consequences of infantry having to advance across cratered ground after a mining attack, officers from the Canadian Corps visited La Boisselle and Fricourt where the mines on the first day of the Somme had been blown. Their reports and the experience of the Canadians at St Eloi in April 1916 ‚Äì where mines had so altered and damaged the landscape as to render occupation of the mine craters by the infantry all but impossible ‚Äì, led to the decision to remove offensive mining from the central sector allocated to the Canadian Corps at Vimy Ridge. In the end, two mines were blown before the attack, while three mines and two Wombat charges were fired to support the attack, including those forming a northern flank.  End of mining operations  Model of the Zonnebeke Church Dugout, one of the shelters constructed by 171st Tunnelling Company at Zonnebeke near Ypres From Spring 1917 the whole war became more mobile, with grand offensives at the Battles of Arras, Messines and Passchendaele, there was no longer a place for a tactic that depended upon total immobility for its employment. As the tactics and counter-tactics required deeper and deeper tunnelling, (hence more time and requiring more stable front lines), offensive and defensive military mining largely ceased. The last mine fired by the British in the First World War was near Givenchy on 10 August 1917. Even after mine warfare had stopped, underground work continued, with the tunnellers concentrating on deep dugouts for troop accommodation, safe from the larger shells being deployed. According to the original trench maps, hospitals, mess rooms, chapels, kitchens, workshops, blacksmiths, as well as bedrooms where exhausted soldiers could rest, were hewn from the blue-clay and stone. Connected by corridors measuring 6 ft 6in high by 4 ft wide, they were fitted with water pumps which, when the troops left within weeks of the war ending, were slowly submerged. The developments at Hill 60 housed 3,000 men, those near Hooge 1,000. The Vampire dugout, a brigade headquarters built by 171st Tunnelling Company near Zonnebeke, was captured and occupied by the Germans in their Spring Offensive in 1918, before being retaken in September. The level of activity can be gauged by the fact that during 1917 and 1918, more people lived underground in the Ypres area than reside in the town today. About 180 dugout sites have been located in the Ypres Salient and in the 1990s some of them were entered, at least in part.Activities of The Diggers ‚Äì Restoration of the Yorkshire Trench & Dug-out, access date 10 July 2015 =Battle of Arras= Exit from the Allied military tunnels in the Carri√®re Wellington In preparation for the Battle of Arras in 1917, the Royal Engineers had been working underground from October 1916, constructing tunnels for the troops.Nicholls, 30‚Äì32 The Arras region is chalky and therefore easily excavated; under Arras itself there is a vast network of caverns (called the boves), which consist of underground quarries, galleries and sewage tunnels. The engineers devised a plan to add new tunnels to this network so that troops could arrive at the battlefield in secrecy and in safety. The scale of this undertaking was enormous: in one sector alone four Tunnel Companies (of 500 men each) worked around the clock in 18-hour shifts for two months. The British attack plan was well developed, drawing on the lessons of the Somme and Verdun in the previous year. Rather than attacking on an extended front, the full weight of artillery fire would be concentrated on a relatively narrow stretch of . The barrage was planned to last about a week at all points on the line, with a much longer and heavier bombardment at Vimy to weaken its strong defences. During the assault, the troops would advance in open formation, with units leapfrogging each other in order to allow them time to consolidate and regroup. Before the action could be undertaken, a great deal of preparation was required, much of it innovative. To assist the attack, the Royal Engineers constructed of tunnels, graded as subways (foot traffic only); tramways (with rails for hand-drawn trollies for taking ammunition to the line and bringing casualties back); and railways (a light railway system). Just before the assault the tunnel system had grown big enough to conceal 24,000 men, with electric lighting provided by its own small powerhouse, as well as kitchens, latrines and a medical centre with a fully equipped operating theatre.New Zealand Defence Force press releaseTunnellers in Arras 24 April 2007\\"The Arras tunnels\\", NZ Ministry for Culture and Heritage, 1 February 2008 The bulk of the work was done by New Zealanders, including MƒÅori and Pacific Islanders from the New Zealand (MƒÅori) Pioneer Battalion, and Bantams from the mining towns of Northern England. Assault tunnels were also dug, stopping a few yards short of the German line, ready to be blown open by explosives on Zero-Day. In addition to this, conventional mines were dug under the front lines, ready to be blown immediately before the assault. Many were never detonated for fear that they would churn up the ground too much. In the meantime, German sappers were actively conducting their own underground operations, seeking out Allied tunnels to assault and counter-mine. Of the New Zealand Tunnelling Company alone, 41 died and 151 were wounded as a result of German counter-mining. Today, most of the tunnels and trenches are off-limits to the public for reasons of safety. A 250-metre portion of the Grange Subway at Vimy Ridge is open to the public from May to November and the Wellington tunnel was opened to the public as the Carri√®re Wellington museum in March 2008.Veterans Affairs Canada website =Second Battle of Passchendaele= A heavy trench mortar emplacement, constructed by No. 2 Section of the 3rd Australian Tunnelling Company In preparation for the Second Battle of Passchendaele, as early as the 17 October, assault units were given all available details about the German defences in their respective sectors, in order to facilitate early planning. Intelligence officers and artillery observers worked jointly in observation posts recording newly built German fortifications as well as those that had previously escaped notice, permitting the artillery to take necessary action before the offensive. To improve the logistical movement of artillery and supplies an extensive programme of road building was started. Ten field companies, seven tunnelling companies, four army troop companies and nine battalions were put to work repairing or extending existing plank roads. From the middle of October until the end of the offensive, a total of of double plank road and more than of heavy tram line was constructed in the Canadian Corps area. Brigadier General Edward Morrison, commanding the artillery, also secured permission to use the roads to the rear for withdrawing disabled guns for repair. Remains and memorials 1st Australian Tunnelling Company Memorial at Hill 60 (Ypres) RE Grave Railway Wood. Many of the largest craters have been left, often too large to fill-in, even today. The largest crater on the Western Front, the Lochnagar Crater, had been left for 50 years, but it had begun to be used by motorbikers and as a rubbish dump. Privately purchased in 1979, it is now a recognized 1914‚Äì1918 historic battlefield site. Around Ypres, some large craters remain near Hooge, as do several of the craters created by the mines in the Battle of Messines, including those at St Eloi (created by a charge of of ammonal), Maedelstede Farm (created by a charge of of ammonal), and at Spanbroekmolen (created by a charge of ammonal). When detonated on 7 June 1917, the blast at Spanbroekmolen formed the \\"Lone Tree Crater\\" with a diameter of and a depth of . The crater was acquired in 1929 by the Toc H foundation in Poperinge and is today recognized as the Pool of Peace memorial.Messines, access date 16 February 2015.

There is a flagpole with the British flag next to it, and in 2003 an artillery gun was added to the memorial. In Givenchy-l√®s-la-Bass√©e, the 'Tunnellers Memorial' commemorates the action on 26 June 1916 for which William Hackett of 254th Tunnelling Company was awarded the Victoria Cross. The memorial stands at the site of the Shaftesbury Shaft and the Red Dragon Crater. Its dimensions, high and wide, mirror the standard interior proportions of mine galleries constructed by the tunnelling companies in the Flanders clays. The memorial was designed by Peter Barton and unveiled on 19 June 2010. Awards =Victoria Cross= At least three men who served with the Tunnelling Companies were awarded the Victoria Cross, two of whom were members of tunneling units at the time of their VC action: * Captain William Henry Johnston (1879‚Äì1915) won the Victoria Cross during the Race to the Sea in September 1914.

There are two main islands - Inishkea North and Inishkea South. The islands have a very small population of two people for the last number of years although the population increases to around 15 people during the summer months of May to September. In the 1900s the islands were populated with more than 350 people, people can still visit the island via a ferry service provided by the Inishkea Island Ferry or better known as Belmullet Boat Charters. The islands lie between Inishglora to their north and Duvillaun to their south, off the Mullet's west coast, and offer some protection to the mainland coast from the power of the eastern Atlantic Ocean. The underlying rock of the Inishkea Island is gneiss and schist, the same as that on the Mullet. The islands are relatively low lying and are covered in machair. Fine white sand is found everywhere, often blown into drifts by the strong winds especially along the beach beside the harbour where it fills the houses of the abandoned village. The sea surrounding the islands is crystal clear. The inhabitants of both Inishkea North and South left the islands in the 1930s after most of their young men died at sea in a storm.Beautiful Isles, The Mayo News. Locator Map of Inishkea North Locator Map of Inishkea South  History  The islands are little known outside of the local area but are well known by fishermen who use the island harbour regularly. There are regular trips from Falmore on the mainland to the islands when weather permits and after a trip taking about half-an-hour, the boat ties up at the pier right beside the pure white sandy beach lined with little ruined cottages, some of them with slate and galvanised roofs and in habitable condition (these being used by surveyors etc. doing work on the islands). Sand has taken its toll on most of the buildings with the floors covered in several feet of white sand blown in from the beach. The island is inhabited by donkeys and many sheep. The earliest evidence of settlement on the island goes back at least 5,000 years and the islands have numerous archaeological sites from the Neolithic and several Early Christian monastic sites. Early Christian sites dating from the sixth to the tenth centuries are found on most of the Erris islands including Duvillaun and Inishglora. A well known archaeologist, Fran√ßoise Henry visited these offshore islands in the 1930s and again in the 1950s. On Inishkea North (which is less visited than the south island) are the ruins of St. Colmcille's Church, the Bailey M√≥r, Bailey Beag and Bailey D√≥ite, small circular areas which contained beehive huts, used by monks in the Early Christian period. On the south island is a tall cross inscribed slab and to its west, the foundations of a small church. Inishkea must have been an important centre in the Early Christian period. In 1927, the men from the islands were night fishing in the clear waters which surround the islands and a sudden violent storm blew up which caught them unawares. Some of the currachs managed to reach home but several failed to get back and one was reputed to have been taken all the way in and thrown up on the mainland with its crew unharmed. In the morning, it was discovered that several currachs and ten young fishermen had been lost. The island community was devastated and a few years later the community was rehoused, mostly on the Mullet Peninsula. The few who had miraculous escapes often related the tale of that fateful night. The last survivor, Pat Reilly, died aged 101 in 2008. The islands had a number of owners including the Barretts, who were a Norman family, the McCormacks who were given the island by King James I and finally the O'Donnells of Newport who took control of them in the 18th century. It is believed by many historians that the islands were abandoned in the Middle Ages before being re-inhabited in the 17th century.  Whaling and shellfish  IN 1908, a Norwegian whaling station was established on Rusheen a small island, a short distance away from the south Iniskea island which is connected to the south island when the tide goes out. Environmental rules and regulations in Norway at the time meant that a lot of the whaling stations there had to be closed down and moved to other countries, like Ireland, where the regulations were not as strict. The industry was short-lived as it lasted only ten years, but it employed a number of local people in difficult times. The presence of the station caused tension between north and south islands, because it is said that all the jobs went to the south islanders and the north islanders were left with just the foul smell from the station. The whale industry on the Inishkeas did not begin and end at the beginning of the 20th century. Sperm whales were a common sight off the coast during the Middle Ages and the most important product at the time to come from the sperm whale was its vomit. The vomit was hugely valuable because when it was washed ashore it had a sweet scent and was sold as perfume and medicine. It was traded in the 17th century from the coast of Connacht through Galway to Spain and onto the spice markets of Cairo and Baghdad where he said it was worth a 'small fortune'. In 1946, French archaeologist Francoise Henry excavated evidence of a 7th-century AD dye workshop on Inishkea North where the monks in an early Christian Monastery were producing it from the shells of the dog whelk The dye fetched high prices at the time it was in high demand. One letter in the Book of Kells would take 500 shells to get enough colour to decorate it. Purple was very important because in early Irish laws only the royalty could wear purple. The tradition came from the Roman tradition, who took it from the Greeks, who borrowed that tradition from the Phoenicians.  Famine and piracy  During the Irish Famine (1845/47), the people on the Inishkea islands were not immune. Like most places in the west of Ireland, the pattern of lazy beds can be seen on the island wherever there was enough soil to sow potatoes, even on the outer reaches near the cliff edge. While the lack of shelter would have made conditions too harsh for potatoes to flourish, the threat of starvation meant that every option had to be tried. However, unlike other areas of the west coast, the famine did not affect the Inishkeas as badly as the mainland. While the population on the mainland fell dramatically during the famine years, it was the opposite on the Inishkea islands because it would appear that potato blight was confined to the mainland. The prevailing winds would have kept the blight off the islands to a degree. The islanders also had the tradition of fishing. It is alleged that the [island inhabitants] were always vigorously and actively engaged in piracy from the island. They were attacking and robbing boats passing west of them. \\"This was the whole island and [the operation] was highly organised, robbing the boats, taking the cargo and distributing it across the island. Wrecking was common along the west coast so the authorities had to deploy Royal Naval ships to stamp it out and there were islanders shot and killed as they attacked the passing vessels. The deliberate wrecking was an alternative enterprise because in the areas along the west coast there was no regulation. However, when coastguards were posted to coastal sites in the latter part of the 19th century, they were despised and hated and they were a disaster, economically, for these islands because they stamped out wrecking and smuggling.  The Godstone  In 1940 English author T. H. White visited the islands and learned the tale of a local artefact named the Godstone or Naomh√≥g. This modest-sized stone object had been an item of veneration, credited by the inhabitants of the islands with the powers of calming weather, speeding growth of potatoes, and quelling fire. The stone had allegedly been cast into the sea sometime in the 19th century upon the urging of one Fr. O'Reilly. White set out to find out what else he could learn. His discoveries - which include pirates, the theft of the stone from North to South Inishkea by islanders jealous of its potato-growing properties, a thrice (or once) annual re-clothing ceremony and the niche in the wall of a south Inishkea hut where the Naomh√≥g had formerly resided - is contained in White's book The Godstone and the Blackymor, which was based upon his contemporary journal.White, T.H. The Godstone and the Blackymor, Jonathan Cape, 1959. Pp 77-80,88,95-135Warner, Sylvia Townsend. T.H. White: A Biography, Jonathan Cape with Chatto & Windus, 1967. Pp 162-5  Flora and fauna  The Inishkea islands are home to large numbers of Atlantic grey seals and the coves and beaches across the islands are the largest breeding colonies for grey seals in Ireland. Over 300 pups are born annually on the islands, compared to just 150-180 in the mid-1990s. However, when pups are born they can't go into the sea for the first ten days and there is a high mortality rate with only 50 per cent of pups expected to survive the first year. While the seals are a protected species, there have been instances of them being culled by fishermen in the past because they bite at fish caught in nets. In the early 1980s over 120 seals and pups were killed on the beaches of the islands but the numbers gradually recovered over the last number of years. The islands are also home to a number of bird species- the geese of the island's name are barnacle geese. In addition, the islands have wheatears, rock pipits and fulmars. Lapwing breed on the island and peregrine falcons hunt for prey. There is evidence of rabbits on the island. The islands have no trees and are composed almost entirely of machair with outcrops of rock. They are crisscrossed by a number of stone walls that provide some shelter for nesting birds.

The episode was written by Timothy Schlattmann and was directed by Keith Gordon. In the episode, Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) investigates a crime scene in a comic book store where he sees a poster of The Dark Defender, a character inspired by Dexter's own crimes under the guise of the \\"Bay Harbor Butcher\\", who is currently under investigation in his own police department. After he dreams that The Dark Defender saved his mother's life when he was young, Dexter's Narcotics Anonymous sponsor Lila Tournay (Jaime Murray) encourages him to seek closure by confronting one of his mother's killers, Santos Jimenez (Tony Amendola). Meanwhile, Dexter's sister Debra (Jennifer Carpenter) suspects that her new boyfriend Gabriel (Dave Baez) is using her to write a book about her engagement to the first season's \\"Ice Truck Killer\\". Schlattmann was inspired to set the homicide case in a comic book store when he realized that an Aquaman snow globe on his desk \\"could easily be a murder weapon\\". When he visited comic book artist Tone Rodriguez to draw and render the poster of The Dark Defender, comic book writer Dan Wickline was also at Rodriguez's studio, and so Schlattmann arranged for the two to have cameo appearances in the episode. The episode was filmed in Los Angeles, California though set in Miami, Florida. \\"The Dark Defender\\" was praised by critics and Schlattmann was nominated for Writers Guild of America Award for his script. The episode was also submitted as Dexters sample episode to determine the nominees for Outstanding Drama Series at the 60th Primetime Emmy Awards; though nominated, the series didn't win. Plot While drinking coffee with Debra, Dexter is called to a comic book store where the shopkeeper has been bludgeoned to death with a snow globe. Dexter sees a poster of The Dark Defender, a vigilante killer based on the Bay Harbor Butcher. Later, at his Narcotics Anonymous meeting, Dexter falls asleep and has a dream in which he, dressed as the Dark Defender, rescues his mother Laura Moser. When he tells his sponsor Lila about his dream, she tells him that he must confront his mother's killers to seek closure. He and Lila travel to Naples, Florida, where one of the three men, Santos Jimenez, is running a tavern. Having been warned by Rita's mother Gail to leave her and her children alone, Dexter tells Rita that he is going away while Gail is visiting. Leaving Lila in their motel room, he goes to Jimenez's bar and waits until closing time to confront him. When Jimenez brandishes a baseball bat, Dexter disarms and beats him, revealing his identity as Laura's son. Jimenez tells Dexter that his mother was killed for being Harry's narcotics informant and lover. Dexter is prepared to kill Jimenez until Lila phones, prompting him to tell her that he is about to \\"use\\". Thinking that he is about to use drugs, she urges him not to go any further, because \\"using\\" will only leave him empty and alone inside. A distraught Dexter returns to the motel, leaving Jimenez unconscious, and falls asleep in Lila's lap. The next morning, Lila confides to Dexter that she went into rehab after getting high on methamphetamine and setting her ex-boyfriend's house on fire, unaware that he was inside. Dexter asks her if she thinks that he deserved to die, something that Lila silently agrees to. Dexter tells her that, \\"It's okay then.\\" Meanwhile, Debra is insecure around Gabriel because of how her previous relationship with Brian ended. Looking through Gabriel's e-mail, she sees that he has sent a book titled The Ice Princess to a number of publishers. Assuming he is writing a tell-all book about her, she angrily breaks up with him. Discussing the break-up with Lundy, he gives her the background check that he had run on Gabriel, revealing that he is a children's writer; Debra realizes that The Ice Princess is a children's book. When Dexter returns to Miami and visits Rita, Gail‚Äîsuspecting that he is hiding something‚Äîannounces that she will be living with Rita from now on. Dexter realizes that he must protect his secrets, so he begins by cleaning his boat that night with a black light to detect any blood. He is unaware that the marina is being videotaped by the Miami-Metro PD, who believe that the Bay Harbor Butcher may be keeping his boat at that marina. Production Schlattmann thought to write the comic book store homicide storyline when he picked up the Aquaman snow globe in his office and thought, \\"'Wow, this thing could easily be a murder weapon,\\" because of its weight and its edge. The writers wanted to use the actual Aquaman globe but DC Comics would not allow the character and the snow globe to be used in the episode, so the Dexter art department custom-made a snow globe. The superhero's name ultimately became \\"Mariner\\" as other names including \\"Sea King\\" and \\"King of the Seas\\" could not be used for legal reasons. Trademark and copyright clearances was again an issue when finding a name for the superhero based on the Bay Harbor Butcher. \\"The Eradicator\\" and \\"Judge Justice\\" were considered, but the final choice was \\"The Dark Defender\\". Cerone said that the name was \\"a little on the generic side, but it was one we could clear.\\" He said that The Dark Defender was in part an homage to Batman: The Dark Knight Returns and to Dexter's Dark Passenger, featured in Jeff Lindsay's series of Dexter novels on which the television series is based. On the poster, The Dark Defender, though hooded, was drawn with a smile to resemble Michael C. Hall. The poster was rendered by comic artist Tone Rodriguez, with whom Schlattmann had previously worked on a screenplay in development at 20th Century Fox. When Schlattmann visited Rodriguez's studio in Los Angeles to discuss the art, comic book writer Dan Wickline was also there. Schlattmann thought that \\"by including the two of them, we could make things a bit more special and add some credibility to the show\\". Wickline played the dead comic book shopkeeper, while Rodriguez played the prime suspect for the murder. The Dark Defender character also lent its name to a series of highly stylized Dexter webisodes, recapping Dexter's victims of the second season. The scenes at the marina where Dexter keeps his boat, Coral Cove, were filmed at the Leeward Bay Marina in Los Angeles' Wilmington neighborhood, in spite of the show's Miami setting. The episode opens in a coffee bar at Coral Cove Marina, which was filmed at Leeward Bay's floating diner, the Chowder Barge. One of the empty barns at Long Beach, California's Shoreline Village was set up as the comic book store. Doakes and LaGuerta discuss the homicide case while standing on the Shoreline Village boardwalk, and the Village car park was used to film Doakes and LaGuerta's stake out. Reception Eric Goldman of IGN called \\"The Dark Defender\\" \\"a very satisfying episode of the show\\" and thought that \\"so far [the cast and crew are] doing a very good job\\" of replicating the tension seen in the first season. He was impressed by Dexter's discoveries about his birth mother and adoptive father, but called Debra's romance with Gabriel a \\"less successful\\" storyline. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Tom O'Neil called the episode a \\"standout\\" because of the parts of Dexter's past that it explored. He stated that, for regular viewers, \\"this episode is a real knockout\\", but for unfamiliar viewers, \\"this whole Dark Defender bit might look pretty corny\\". TV Squad's Keith McDuffee believed the revelation of Laura's affair with Harry to be \\"certainly the most shocking moment of the episode\\", and thought that \\"One of the brilliant moments of the season so far was Dexter going after one of his mom's killers.\\" Paula Paige of TV Guide called Dexter's monologue about his hollowness \\"very moving\\". She thought that his confrontation with his mother's killer \\"may have been one of the best shot [scenes] in the whole series\\". Blogcritics Ray Ellis praised the \\"razor-sharp sense of humor\\" seen in the episode and thought that \\"In a season of mostly dreary, bland series, Dexter remains the most daring show on television.\\" Dexter and Jimenez's confrontation was named Hall's best scene by Variety critic Stuart Levine. In a short recap of seasons 1 and 2 in Film Quarterly, J. M. TyreeJones Lecturer in Fiction at Stanford University's Creative Writing program. called \\"The Dark Defender\\" season 2's \\"most intriguing episode\\", and compared Dexter to Batman: > When the identities of the Butcher's victims are revealed to be murderers, > the public applauds him, elevating Dexter to the status of a folktale > avenger or comic-book anti-hero.

The Else is a distributary of the river Hase and begins at a river bifurcation near Melle.  Origin  The River Else does not have a source but originates at a hydrological phenomenon known as a river bifurcation. The bifurcation is near Gesmold (part of the borough of Melle) in Lower Saxony, where the river Else branches off the river Hase (at Hase river kilometre 158.9). The bifurcation may have been created or established artificially; or at least maintained artificially. This is however unclear. In history there were disputes over the distribution of water that was able to be controlled by man-made means. For example, the entire water flow could be diverted either into the River Hase or River Werre during conflicts. Today the Hase loses a third of its water mass at the bifurcation. The Hase flows northwest to the Ems, while the Else flows east to the Weser.  Course  The River Else flows slowly through the Ravensberg Hills and through the wetlands known as the Else meadows (Elseauen). The Else and Werre valleys, which were formed during the ice age, are bordered in the south by the Teutoburg Forest and in the north by the ridge of the Wiehen Hills. After the bifurcation in Melle the river flows east into North Rhine-Westphalia, passing the state border at river kilometre 19.2 and crossing R√∂dinghausen and B√ºnde, before discharging, after a distance of approximately 35 km, into the Werre near the eastern edge of Kirchlengern. The Werre swings east at its mouth by almost 90¬∞, thus aligning itself with the west-to-eastern course of the Else. The River Else passes under the A 30 federal motorway three times (at Gesmold (km 33), at Bruchm√ºhlen (km 22) and at B√ºnde (km 15). The Else Valley Bridge crosses the river at Kirchlengern. The Else is dammed several times along its length. A particularly large number of weirs is located on the lower reaches between B√ºnde and its mouth; the Else's velocity here is controlled over a short distance by 4 weirs.  Tributaries  Delta of River Else in River Werre Designated tributaries, which flow into river Else or the parallel led river Neue Else are (from bifurcation to mouth): * Oldendorfer M√ºhlenbach (L 31,1) * Strotbach (R 29,5) * Laerbach (R 29) * Zwickenbach (L 29) * Maschgraben (R 25,9) * Eickener M√ºhlenbach (L 24,5) * Violen Bach (R 24) * Bruchriede (R 22,1) * Suttbach (L 21,5) * Kilverbach (L 19,5) * M√ºhlenbach (R 18,4) * Bennier Graben (L, 18,2) * Alte Else (R, 17,1) * Ahler Bruchgraben (L 16,2) * Warmenau (R 15,3) * Darm√ºhlenbach (L 12) * Sunderbach (L 10,5) * Neue Else (R, 10) * Gewinghauser Bach (L 8,8) * Knollerbach (L 8,3) * Ostbach (M√ºhlenbach) (L, 7,3) * Eselsbach (L 6,7) * Markbach (L 4,4) * Brandbach (Bolldammbach) (R, 3,7) (L/R; KM): Left right supply, with river kilometer, delta with km 0)  Watershed  Distributary Neue Else near B√ºnde The watershed of river Else has a size of 414,6 km¬≤. In the watershed approximately live 100,000 people. The following municipalities lie at river Else: * Melle * R√∂dinghausen * B√ºnde * Kirchlengern * L√∂hne In addition to the watershed lie totally or partly: * Spenge * Enger * Hiddenhausen * Werther * Borgholzhausen  Nature reserve  On the North-Rhine/Westphalian side there are two adjacent nature reserves with the same name of Elseaue (\\"Else water meadows\\") with a total area of . The reserves were established in 1994 and 1995. The area lies north of the Else and south of the railway line from L√∂hne to Osnabr√ºck along a 3.5 km long section of the river. The area is protected, because it is a near-natural floodplain in the middle of the intensively farmed Ravensberg Land. On the floodplain, the remnants of former river courses of the Else may be recognized. The floodplain is largely turned over to grassland with flood banks. The steep river banks, up to 3m high, are a haven for the kingfisher.  Tourism  In B√ºnde there is an association for canoe sports. Due to its good water quality, fishing in always possible in the river. In addition the Else-Werre cycle way on the river continues to lead along and of the delta into the Werre up to the Weser.

It was at one time billed as \\"America's Oldest Daily Community Newspaper.\\" The Daily Calumet was located at 9120 S. Baltimore Ave., Chicago, in the South Chicago neighborhood on the city's Southeast Side. Depending on the delineation of ward boundaries, it was either in the 7th or 10th Ward. It served the communities within the city of South Chicago, South Shore, Irondale/Slag Valley, South Deering, the East Side and Hegewisch as well as the neighboring suburbs of Calumet City and Burnham. Affectionately known as \\"The Cal\\" to generations of readers, the newspaper covered only topics of local interest and it was not until its finals years that it used any wire service copy. In the early 1980s, The Daily Calumet subscribed to the United Press International service to augment the copy produced by its staff of reporters, photographers and correspondents. Reporting areas, or \\"beats\\" were divided into four areas of responsibility on The Daily Calumet. The police beat, known internally as the \\"cops and courts\\" beat, was basically focused on news from the 4th District of the Chicago Police Department. The detective bureau covered by The Daily Calumet was Area 2, which comprised districts 3 (Grand Crossing), 4 (South Chicago) 6 (Gresham) and 22 (Morgan Park). The most sensational police coverage done by The Daily Calumet concerned the 1966 murders of six student nurses by drifter Richard Speck. The women were killed in an apartment rented by South Chicago Community Hospital on East 100th Street. Photographers and reporters from The Daily Calumet were the first media on the scene and were allowed unparalleled access to the homicide scene. The newspaper also extensively reported and photographed the October 30, 1972 collision between two Illinois Central commuter trains, which originated from the IC's 91st Street station in South Chicago. The wreck, which killed 45 people and injured 332, remains the worst commuter rail crash in Chicago's history, and carried a number of victims from the newspaper's coverage area. The labor beat, which covered both the unions and the businesses of the Southeast Side, concentrated heavily on the steel and auto industries that made up the bulk of the local manufacturing employers. Among the largest of these were the South Works of United States Steel, Republic (later LTV) Steel, Wisconsin Steel, the Chicago Assembly Plant of Ford Motor Company and related suppliers to the above industries. The most significant coverage on the labor beat was during the 1937 Memorial Day Massacre when Chicago police shot down several striking workers at the Republic Steel plant on Avenue O. The education beat covered numerous parochial and public schools on the Southeast Side. The high schools covered by The Daily Calumet included Washington High School, Bowen High School, Hirsch High School and St. Francis De Sales High School operated by the Archdiocese of Chicago. The political beat covered both the 7th Ward and 10th Ward organizations. As part of its coverage, the beat reporter would attend Chicago City Council meetings. The beat also covered the state house and senate districts within the Southeast Side area and the 2nd Congressional District of the U.S. House. Some of the most intense political reporting came during the administration of Chicago Mayor Harold Washington, whose primary nemesis on the council floor was Ald. Edward Vrdolyak, the 10th Ward alderman. Vrdolyak led the floor opposition to Washington during the stormy time known as \\"Council Wars,\\" a play on words from the popular \\"Star Wars\\" films, when the Washington bloc found itself at odds and often outnumbered or outmaneuvered by Vrdolyak and his allies. The environment beat was created during the turn of the 1980s, when Waste Management Corp. tried unsuccessfully to create a nature preserve in Burnham, Illinois, to mitigate a planned expansion of its CID Landfill near 130th Street and the Calumet (Bishop Ford) Expressway, and the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency initiated legal actions against several small operating and closed landfills concentrated in a heavily industrialized area near Torrence Avenue. In addition to these \\"beats,\\" reporters were encouraged to produce enterprise stories on any neighborhood subject of their choice. The Daily Calumet also had a photo department with two full-time staffers and several stringers; two full-time sports personnel and a full-time Lifestyles editor and an assistant. As the neighborhood demographics changed, The Daily Calumet added a Spanish language page known as \\"Fin de Semana\\" or \\"Weekend\\" which served the growing Latino market. In approximately 1980, The Daily Calumet was sold by its owners, Panax Publishing Co., to a British-owned group from Liverpool. After several years, the British group sold the paper to Pulitzer, which owned The Daily Southtown newspaper which served Chicago's Southwest Side. After about two years of operation by Pulitzer, The Daily Calumet nameplate was phased out and replaced by The Daily Southtown, which opened a bureau in a building owned by The Daily Calumet in south suburban Lansing, Ill. at 18127 William St. The office was closed and The Daily Southtown effectively withdrew from the southeastern Chicago market when its product failed to catch on with the local population. The Daily Calumet building at 9120 S. Baltimore Avenue in Chicago was donated to the South Chicago YMCA. After a structural analysis determined the building was not safe, it was razed to expand the YMCA parking area. The Lansing building was sold, was razed and is now the site of a medical building. John Kass, a columnist who appears daily on page 2 of the Chicago Tribune, got his start in journalism at The Daily Calumet.

He lives and works in Taipei, Taiwan.  Biography  Duval was born in Paris, France in 1977. His mother worked for the luxury goods manufacturer Herm√®s, while his father was an interior decorator. Duval studied for six years at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure d'arts de Paris-Cergy, before moving to Tokyo in 2004.  Career  Duval's work encompasses conceptual art, film, sculpture, product design, and visual communication. His alter ego Item Idem (Latin for \\"the same\\"), operates as a brand for the artist, whose work often builds on top of existing fashion and retail brands. The New York Times reviewed one of Duval's performances as \\"Celine Dion at the Oscars channeling Ren√© Magritte,\\" while the writer John Stones has described the artist's persona as \\"Austin Powers pretending to be Philippe Starck, art directed by Marcel Duchamp and scripted by Oscar Wilde.\\" = Retail design and installations = In 2004, Duval was discovered by Sarah Andelman, the creative director of Colette, and through the Paris-based boutique took up in Tokyo with the Japanese fashion label Comme des Gar√ßons. His work began to incorporate interior design and conceptual installations. In 2004, Duval collaborated with other artists on a relational aesthetics- inspired, multidisciplinary space called Caniche Courage, and later transformed his three-story Shibuya residence into a living exhibition. Duval initiated a series of staged retail and working environments, beginning with The Wrong Store (2006) in Paris, a collaboration with Tobi Wong conceived as an ersatz gift-shop counterpart to Maurizio Cattelan's Wrong Gallery. Back in Tokyo, he transformed the window display of a fashion boutique into a temporary work space titled The Wrong Office, which he followed up with The Wrong Motel. Duval collaborated with Bernhard Willhelm on the German fashion designer's flagship store at the PARCO department store in Shibuya, Tokyo. The shop's re-use of cardboard, plastic, and rope materials was inspired by the resourcefulness of Japan's homeless communities. The store won the Best Shop Concept for FRAME magazine's 2007 Great Indoors Award. In 2009, Duval participated in the Cycles and Seasons fashion and art event in Moscow. In 2011, Duval was the first artist-in-residence at BLESS HOME, an apartment-cum- shop in Berlin, which became his temporary studio while serving as the art director for Bruce LaBruce's production of Pierrot Lunaire. In 2015, he built an installation as an interior for Airbnb's Art House for Art Basel Hong Kong. Duval has worked with a number of art publications, including as the Fashion Director for Tokion (2005), Fashion Features Director for Modern Weekly China (2013), Special Projects coordinator for Flash Art (2006), and as a collaborator with 032c, T: The New York Times Style Magazine, and LEAP Magazine. He has also worked on large-scale commercial projects for CELINE and Ford. = Exhibitions and collaborations = In 2007, Duval reconfigured CELINE's Tokyo store to host his exhibition Displaysthetics during DesignTide Tokyo. In 2008, he participated in Fredric Snitzer Gallery's show in Miami, Death by Basel, with an oversized Chanel logo in the style of McDonald's Golden Arches, as a comparison of the brands and their markets. For AA Bronson's School for Young Shaman's exhibition in New York, Duval fashioned a cape out of Louis Vuitton bags and melted car tires, which was an homage to Joseph Bueys. For the exhibition Dysfashional at the Garage Museum in Moscow in 2010, Duval created a work titled Mount Blushmore, a crystal engraving which combined images of fashion icons Anna Wintour, Donatella Versace, John Galliano and Karl Lagerfeld. In 2014, Duval mounted his first solo exhibition at Johannes Vogt, New York, titled Voir Dire. In 2016, Duval participated in the Work in Progress artist residency in Times Square, New York. That same year, he held an exhibition titled Method of Loci at The Breeder Gallery in Athens, Greece, and collaborated with Flash Art Special Projects in a special presentation at Paramount Ranch. Duval has exhibited at the Centre Pompidou, the Garage Museum, MoMA PS1, and Palais de Tokyo. His work has been featured in 032c, Casa BRUTUS, FRAME, The New York Times, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Harper‚Äôs Bazaar Korea, and WWD. = Shanzhai Biennial = Duval is the co-founder of the artists collective Shanzhai Biennial with stylist Avena Gallagher and artist Babak Radboy. The collective describes itself as a \\"multinational brand posing as an art-project posing as an [sic] multinational brand posing as a biennial\\", \\"a pure brand unencumbered by products\\", in other words a \\"meta-brand\\". The name is meant to evoke a bi-annual art exhibition, but instead of taking a city as its namesake, it refers to the Shanzhai counterfeit consumer goods industry in China, and the intentionally incorrect appropriation of luxury brand names. Inspired by knockoff goods in Manhattan's Chinatown, the collective was initiated as a critique of the art and fashion industries, as well as a celebration of the ingenuity and humour of Shanzhai culture. The collective undertakes projects by invitation from cultural institutions or brands, and highlights the aspect of Shanzhai that M+ curator Aric Chen has called the \\"pop art of China\\". As a precursor to the collective's projects, Duval curated a selection of Shanzhai objects in collaboration with DIS Magazine. The objects were photographed by Marco Roso for an exhibition titled Shanzhai Anxiety at Colette in 2011. Shanzhai Biennial No. 1 was held during Beijing Design Week 2012. The artists created a fake fashion campaign photo-shoot based on the paintings of Chinese artist Yue Minjun, and installed a false store-front in Beijing's Chaochangdi village, complete with red carpet, rope lines, and a step and repeat press wall. The ad campaign also ran as an eight-page editorial in the Chinese lifestyle magazine Modern Weekly. When the New York Times mistook the project for \\"a high-concept fashion line\\" that hadn't yet produced a collection, the artists decided not to issue a correction. Shanzhai Biennial No. 2 consisted of a video depicting the artist Wu Ting Ting dressed as a shampoo bottle and lip-syncing to a Chinese rendition of Sin√©ad O'Connor‚Äôs Nothing Compares 2 U, and was displayed on an LED curtain for MoMA PS1's ProBio exhibition in 2013. The artists followed this up with Shanzhai Biennial No. 3 at Frieze London 2014, conceived as a branding exercise for the art fair. Working with a local luxury real- estate agency, the artists transformed a booth space into a model real-estate office ostensibly selling a ‚Ç§32 million London mansion, complete with a professional ad campaign, and trafficking in the Frieze brand with a fake luxury bag, and limited edition souvenirs. Shanzhai Biennial has collaborated with the designer Telfar Clemens, the musician Fatima Al Qadiri, as well as TankTV and DIS Magazine, and has exhibited work at West Bund Art & Design, Centre Pompidou, and the New Museum. = Films = In 2013, Duval created the short film Joss with Chinese artist Cheng Ran, depicting paper funeral items resembling fashion accessories and commercial brands being destroyed by flames and fire crackers. The film has been screened at Palais de Tokyo (Paris), K11 Art Foundation Pop-up Space (Hong Kong), and Museum of Contemporary Art Taipei. Duval's short film NUII premi√®red at the Bethlehem Baptist Church in Los Angeles in 2017. The film features corporate and political symbols being burnt in effigy. His experimental short film COLD SINGLE was filmed in Taitung, Taiwan, with Taiwanese director Mel Hsieh, inspired by his life in the country. The film was presented for the first time at ASIA NOW at the Paris Asian Art Fair in 2019, with its US premi√®re set for Frieze Los Angeles 2020 at the Paramount Theatre.

She also owns a pet hamster named Lulu. Her colors are purple and orange, her player number is 2. When her helmet is off, she's revealed to have bangs and purple hairbands. She was voiced by Stacey DePass. * GT - GT is a bulldog that is a natural born inventor and mechanic. His colors are blue and white and his player number is 3. It is said that GT can fix just about any car, and \\"could probably make an engine out of a leash and some empty dog food cans\\". He was voiced by Dan Petronijevic. * Strut - A dachshund who is his own worst enemy, Strut makes up for his small size by making big plans, that sometimes backfire. He wants to win so badly that he'll break the rules and take shortcuts to make it happen. His colors are blue and yellow and his player number is 5. His car has six tires unlike all the other cars. He is the only one of the Turbo Dogs who regularly uses his car's special apparatus to give him an unfair advantage during the races, however it usually ends up with him spinning out or crashing. If there's a way to get what he wants without working for it, you can be sure he'll try it. He was voiced by Joris Jarsky. * Stinkbert - Stinkbert is a terrier with a strong odor who likes garbage. His colors are chartreuse and goldenrod and his player number is 6. He is a Lakeland Terrier. He is shown to have a cheerful and relaxed personality. One of his talents is cooking. He was voiced by Hadley Kay. * Clutch - Clutch is a Turbo Dog who is just a bit of a klutz. He is a Bernese Mountain Dog. While all the dogs like him, he's closest to Strut and Stinkbert than he is to Dash, Mags, or GT. As a result, he often gets mixed up in Strut's dastardly plans. His colors are green and yellow and his player number is 7. He was voiced by Peter Cugno. * Cam - A Beagle who is the announcer for every race. He is usually seen on the large display screen on the side of his personal airship that he flies above the racetrack during races.

The Globe and Mail, Canada's national newspaper, says this about Turbo Dogs: \\"This new cartoon takes the creativity ingenuity of the movie CARS and uses dogs instead. For many kids, the combination couldn't be better. Turbo Dogs is a glossy, computer animated toon based on the book Racer Dogs, by Bob Kolar. The series is full of verve, humor and parent-friendly messages about helping your friends and being a good sport. Turbo Dogs ends with its fourth season sometime in 2014.\\" The Hollywood Reporter writes: \\"Bottom Line: Going to the dogs is a good thing in this charming new animated series. The best thing about Turbo Dogs is its flawless animation, and the dogs all are charming in a loopy kind of way. It's all stuff kids will love, and the education they might get - how to behave in the world and find what's important - is an extra added canine attraction.\\" Episodes References External links * Huhu Studios website Category:Canadian computer-animated television series Category:2000s Canadian animated television series Category:2010s Canadian animated television series Category:2008 Canadian television series debuts Category:2011 Canadian television series endings Category:New Zealand children's animated comedy television series Category:2000s New Zealand television series Category:2010s New Zealand television series Category:2008 New Zealand television series debuts Category:2011 New Zealand television series endings Category:Qubo Category:CBC Television original programming Category:Animated television series about dogs Category:Animated television series about auto racing Category:Canadian television shows based on children's books Category:Canadian children's animated comedy television series Category:Canadian animated television shows featuring anthropomorphic characters Category:Canadian preschool education television series ","title":"Turbo Dogs"},{"id":"20114540","text":"HTTP Message Body is the data bytes transmitted in an HTTP transaction message immediately following the headers if there are any (in the case of HTTP/0.9 no headers are transmitted).

The company builds boats ranging from 30 feet - 58 feet, and is headquartered in Oconto, Wisconsin. Most models in the 2009 lineup are offered with both gasoline and diesel engine options, and the company was one of the first boat builders to utilize the Volvo Penta IPS propulsion system. History The company was founded in 1953 in Oconto by Ray, Glenn, brothers Roy and Grant, and brothers Bob and Ted Thompson. They were second-generation members of the Thompson family, involved in boat building at Peshtigo, WI and Cortland, New York. Roy and Grant were following in their father Chris's footsteps, as he had co- founded the Thompson Bros. Boat Mfg. Company in 1904 in nearby Peshtigo, Wisconsin. The company was originally known as \\"Cruisers Incorporated\\", or \\"Cruisers Inc.\\" for short. They set up operations in the former Holt Lumber planing mill in Oconto. In the first year of operation, Cruisers constructed 14- and 16-foot lapstrake boats, and sold them to the Thompson Bros. Boat Mfg Co. with the Thompson name badge on the hulls. The first shipment left the Oconto factory on November 18, 1953. The first cabin-cruiser model was a 19-foot 3-inch lapstrake boat, which was introduced at the 1954 New York Boat Show; she featured a sink, alcohol stove, water closet, cushioned bunks to sleep four, cabin lights and a collapsible table. In 1956, the first Cruisers product catalog debuted. The company was producing 60 boats per week then, and the work force had grown from 20 to 101, over 5 times its size, in three years. By 1961, 300 people were employed at the company. At this time they were producing 12 different models, ranging from 14 feet to 20 feet long. Cruisers claimed to be the foremost lapstrake boat builder in the world. In 1959 and 1960, they made 3,000 boats annually. Then the bottom fell out of the wooden-boat market. A reorganization of the three Thompson family owned boat plants at Peshtigo, Cortland, NY and Oconto went into effect on 1 January 1959. Cruisers, Inc. became the sole property of Roy and Grant Thompson. Ray Thompson and family gained control of Thompson Bros. boat Mfg. Co. at Peshtigo. A new corporation was formed at Cortland, NY to run that operation; Thompson Boat Company of New York, Inc. with Bob, Ted and Glenn Thompson as owners. As fiberglass boats hit the scene, customers abandoned wooden vessels en masse. Cruisers resisted the change, with the Thompsons believing firmly that a well-built wooden boat would outperform and outlive any fiberglass version of itself. Cruisers sold less than 800 boats in the 1965 season, and wooden boats were eliminated from the line by the end of 1966. In 1982, Cruisers acquired the fiberglass portion of the boat division of Mirro Aluminum Company. Cruisers International in Coventry was set up in 1985, creating 24 ft ‚Äì 30 ft fiberglass cruising boats for the European market. The best sellers were the Cruisers Intl 224 Holiday and Vee Express 267. The Vee Express 267 was a smaller 6‚Äì8-berth version of the USA constructed Vee Express 296. Cruisers International folded in 1992 as the result of a fault in the 267 mouldings that occurred when the UK company moved to a smaller location and left the mould outside in the elements. Cruisers Yachts today In the early 1990s, the boat building business suffered as the economy worsened. Venture Capitalist K.C. Stock, an experienced businessman in the Oconto area, saw potential in the struggling company and knew that if the biggest employer in the town were to close, it would be devastating to the town's economy. In 1993, his company KCS International purchased the company and renamed it Cruisers Yachts. Soon after, the industry saw an upswing in sales and an increasing demand. The company expanded its model lineup year after year. Today, the company builds express cruiser and flybridge style yachts, and has recently introduced new models that fit into the new sport coupe class of express boat. The company currently employs approximately 1,000 people, with an annual sales figure exceeding $94 million.

KapposGene Quinn, Arguments Complete at the US Supreme Court, IPWatchdog.com, Nov. 9, 2009 (last visited July 3, 2015).Tr. of Oral Arg. (PDF) in In re Bilski, , (last visited July 3, 2015).Briefs in In re Bilski (last visited Nov. 10, 2009).) that affirmed the judgment of the CAFC, but revised many aspects of the CAFC's decision. In its decision, handed down on June 28, 2010, the Supreme Court rejected the machine-or-transformation test as the sole test of process patent eligibility based on an interpretation of the language of ¬ß 101.Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. 593, 601 (2010). The majority, however, had high praise for the Federal Circuit opinions, advising that \\"[s]tudents of patent law would be well advised to study these scholarly opinions.\\"Bilski v. Kappos, 561 U.S. at 600.  Background and prior history The applicants (Bernard L. Bilski and Rand Warsaw) filed a patent application (on 10 April 1997) for a method of hedging risks in commodities trading via a fixed bill system. Such patent claims are often termed business method claims. The serial number for the patent application is 08/833,892. The text is available on the USPTO web site.J.A. of In re Bilski (text of patent application serial number 08/833892). The patent application describes a method for providing a fixed bill energy contract to consumers. Under fixed bill energy contracts, consumers pay monthly prices for their future energy consumption in advance of winter based on their past energy use. The monthly prices remain the same no matter how much energy they then use. Thus, consumers save money relative to others if, for example, a given winter is unusually cold and they use an unusually large amount of energy for heating. On the other hand, consumers pay more than others if a winter is unusually warm and their energy use is lower than average. Method claim 1 of the patent application claims a three-step method for a broker to hedge risks for purchaser-users of an input of a product or service (termed a commodity). For example, an electric power plant might be a purchaser and user of coal, which it purchases from coal-mining companies (producer-sellers) and uses to make electricity. The power plant might seek to insulate itself from upward changes in the price of coal by engaging in \\"hedging\\" transactions. The risk can be quantified in terms of dollars (termed a \\"risk position\\"). Thus, if the purchaser-user uses 1000 tons of coal in a given period, and the potential price spike is $10 per ton, the purchaser-user's total risk position for that period is 1000 √ó $10, or $10,000. The claimed process comprises these steps (simplified for easier readability): # initiating a series of sales or options transactions between a broker and purchaser-users by which the purchaser-users buy the commodity at a first fixed rate based on historical price levels; # identifying producer- sellers of the commodity; and # initiating a series of sales or options transactions between the broker and producer-sellers, at a second fixed rate, such that the purchasers' and sellers' respective risk positions balance out. The patent examiner rejected all 11 of the claims on the grounds that \\"the invention is not implemented on a specific apparatus and merely manipulates [an] abstract idea and solves a purely mathematical problem without any limitation to a practical application, therefore, the invention is not directed to the technological arts.\\" Ex parte Bilski, No. 2002-2257 (B.P.A.I. Sept. 26, 2006) (last viewed July 3, 2015). The applicants appealed the rejection to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences (BPAI), which affirmed the rejection, although on different grounds. The Board held that the examiner erred to the extent he relied on a \\"technological arts\\" test because the case law does not support such a test. Further, the Board held that the requirement of a specific apparatus was also erroneous because a claim that does not recite a specific apparatus may still be directed to patent-eligible subject matter \\"if there is a transformation of physical subject matter from one state to another.\\" The Board concluded that Applicants' claims did not involve any patent-eligible transformation, holding that transformation of \\"non-physical financial risks and legal liabilities of the commodity provider, the consumer, and the market participants\\" is not patent-eligible subject matter. The Board also held that Applicants' claims \\"preempt[] any and every possible way of performing the steps of the [claimed process], by human or by any kind of machine or by any combination thereof,\\" and thus concluded that they only claim an abstract idea ineligible for patent protection. Finally, the Board held that Applicants' process as claimed did not produce a \\"useful, concrete and tangible result,\\" and for this reason as well was not drawn to patent-eligible subject matter. The applicants appealed the rejection to the Federal Circuit. The case was argued before a panel of the court on October 1, 2007. The court then ordered an en banc rehearing sua sponte, which was held on May 8, 2008. The Federal Circuit issued its decision on October 30, 2008.In re Bilski , (en banc).  Majority opinion  The en banc Federal Circuit upheld the rejection, 9‚Äì3. The majority opinion by Chief Judge Paul Redmond Michel characterized the issue as whether the claimed method is a patent- eligible \\"process,\\" as the patent statute (35 U.S.C. ¬ß 101) uses that term. While any series of actions or operations is a process in the dictionary sense of that term, the court explained, the Supreme Court has held that the statutory meaning is narrower than the dictionary meaning which \\"forecloses a purely literal reading.\\" Patent-eligible processes do not include \\"laws of nature, natural phenomena, [or] abstract ideas.\\" The limiting legal principle applies not just to processes, but to anything on which a patent is sought. As a trilogy of Supreme Court decisions on patent-eligibility from approximately three decades ago had taught, \\"Phenomena of nature, though just discovered, mental processes, and abstract intellectual concepts are not patentable, as they are the basic tools of scientific and technological work.\\" See Gottschalk v. Benson, 409 U.S. 63 (1972); Parker v. Flook, 437 U.S. 584 (1978); and Diamond v. Diehr, 450 U.S. 175 (1981). Therefore, the question was whether Bilski's process fell within any of the prohibited categories (that is, was a claim to a \\"principle\\"), and the underlying legal question was what legal tests or criteria should govern that determination when a claim is directed to a principle. The court concluded that prior decisions of the Supreme Court were of limited usefulness as guides because they represented polar cases on the abstraction and concreteness spectrum. Nonetheless, a legal test could be distilled from them: \\"A claimed process is surely patent-eligible under ¬ß 101 if: (1) it is tied to a particular machine or apparatus, or (2) it transforms a particular article into a different state or thing.\\" Not only did the patent-eligibility trilogy (Benson, Flook, and Diehr) support this test, the court explained, but so too did earlier Supreme Court precedents dating back well into the 19th century. The court then considered whether this two-branch test should be considered all-inclusive, that is, as stating indispensable conditions of patent-eligibility. It concluded that the answer was affirmative, even though much of the language in the Supreme Court's patent- eligibility trilogy was more reserved.See Timothy B. Lee, Supremes wrestle with business method, software patents, (Nov. 11, 2009) (\\"The patent office has been pushing this 'machine or transformation' test since at least the 1970s. The Supreme Court flirted with adopting it in its famous trio of software patent cases a generation ago. But ultimately, it stopped short, merely calling it a 'clue' to patent eligibility. The Federal Circuit, perhaps cowed by the recent string of unanimous Supreme Court reversals of its decisions, went further: it adopted the test as a substitute for the 'useful, concrete and tangible result' that the Supremes had ridiculed two years earlier.\\"). The Federal Circuit placed great weight on the use of the definite article in several Supreme Court statements that transformation and use of a particular machine provided \\"the clue to the patentability of a process claim.\\" At the same time the court placed no weight on the fact that the Benson Court had not accepted the Government's argument that the case law \\"cannot be rationalized otherwise.\\"See Pet'r's Reply Br. on writ of Cert. in Benson, at 9. The Federal Circuit observed that two caveats exist to the transformation-machine test: (1) a field-of-use limitation is insufficient to avoid the prohibition against pre-emption, as Flook expressly held; and (2) conventional or obvious \\"insignificant post-solution activity\\" does not make what is otherwise a claim to a principle patent-eligible (again referring to Flook). The court added that insignificant pre-solution activity (such as data-gathering) is equally ineffective, and so too is an insignificant step in the middle of a process (such as recording a result). The court then rejected other proposed tests of patent-eligibility that had been suggested since the Supreme Court's trilogy. Several Federal Circuit panel decisions had held that a process was patent-eligible if it produced \\"a useful, concrete, and tangible result\\" ‚Äî such as the transformation of financial data from one form to another form. Thus, in the State Street Bank v. Signature Financial Group case State St. Bank & Trust Co. v. Signature Fin. Grp., Inc., . See also AT&T; Corp. v. Excel Commc'n, Inc., ). the court had upheld a patent on a tax- avoidance scheme under this standard. The court now recognized that this test is \\"inadequate,\\" as a dissenting Supreme Court opinion had already stated,In dissenting from the dismissal of certiorari in Lab. Corp. of Am. Holdings v. Metabolite Labs., Inc., 548 U.S. 124, 136‚Äì37 (2006), Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Souter joined, pointed out how the State Street test makes things patent-eligible that Supreme Court decisions had held patent-ineligible. and therefore backed away from the language, denying that the Federal Circuit had ever \\"intended to supplant the Supreme Court's test.\\" The court did not, however, expressly hold that State Street should be overruled: it merely dropped a footnote stating that \\"those portions of our opinions in State Street and AT&T; relying solely on a 'useful, concrete and tangible result' analysis should no longer be relied on.\\" The court next turned to the \\"technological arts\\" test (a patent-eligible advance must be \\"technological\\" in nature) and rejected it on several grounds: The meanings of \\"technological arts\\" and \\"technology\\" are disputed and ambiguous. No court has ever adopted the test. The technological-arts test is not an equivalent of or \\"shortcut,\\" the court insisted, that can be used instead of the transformation-machine test. \\"Rather, the machine-or-transformation test is the only applicable test and must be applied, in light of the guidance provided by the Supreme Court and this court, when evaluating the patent- eligibility of process claims.\\" On the other hand, the court refused to adopt a test that barred business methods, under that rubric, from patent- eligibility. Also, while the court stated that the machine-or-transformation test was the applicable test, the Supreme Court in Benson had stated that there could be cases where a claim that fails the \\"requirements of [its] prior precedents\\" may still nonetheless be patent-eligible subject matter. Benson, 409 U.S. at 71. Similarly, software could not categorically be excluded. The court also stated that future developments may alter the standing or the application of the test. =Bilski's method= Turning finally to Bilski's method, the court held it patent-ineligible. First, the court said, Bilski did not argue that the rejected claims recited any specific or \\"particular\\" machine, so that the court found it unnecessary to decide any issues relating to the machine-implementation branch of the test. \\"We leave to future cases the elaboration of the precise contours of machine implementation, as well as the answers to particular questions, such as whether or when recitation of a computer suffices to tie a process claim to a particular machine.\\"However, one of Benson's rejected claims had a computer part (shift register) as a recited element, and the Court dismissed this machine limitation as meaningless from a practical standpoint. Second, the court turned to transformation of articles from one thing or state to another. What is an \\"article\\"? Benson had made it clear that tanning hides, smelting ores, and vulcanizing rubber were all instances of transforming articles. This corresponded to the transformation test as the PTO and some amici curiae articulated it: one physical substance is transformed into a second physical substance. But what of electronic signals and electronically manipulated data? Or even more abstract constructs such as legal obligations, which the Bilski case involved? No Supreme Court precedents addressed such entities. Some Federal Circuit decisions, however, had held some transformations of signals and data patent-eligible. For example, the Abele decision approved a dependent claim to a method transforming X-ray attenuation data produced in a X-Y field by an X-ray tomographic scanner to an image of body organs and bones ‚Äî while at the same time the Abele court rejected a more generic and abstract independent claim to a process of graphically displaying variances from their average values of unspecified data obtained in an unspecified manner.In re Abele, . The court said that this kind of difference between the two claims was critical to patent-eligibility. The dependent claim, unlike the independent claim, involved signal data representing tangible physical objects, which were electronically manipulated to provide a screen image of the physical objects. But Bilski's process had nothing to do with such a procedure. Like State Street, Bilski involved manipulation of financial data. Bilski's method claim was patent-ineligible because it did not \\"transform any article to a different state or thing.\\" Legal obligations (such as options and futures contracts) and business risks \\"cannot meet the test because they are not physical objects or substances, and they are not representative of physical objects or substances.\\" Moreover, to the extent that signals are involved and are transformed, they are not \\"representative of any physical object or substance.\\" Accordingly, Bilski's claim entirely failed the transformation- machine test. Concurrences and dissents =Concurrence by Judge Dyk= Judge Dyk, joined by Judge Linn, concurred in the majority opinion upholding the PTO's rejection of Bilski's patent, but concurred also in Judge Mayer's historical analysis that the framers of the Constitution intended to exclude from the operation of the US patent system \\"methods for organizing human activity that do not involve manufactures, machines, or compositions of matter.\\" Since Bilski's method failed that test, it is patent-ineligible. =Dissent by Judge Mayer= Judge Mayer dissented, first, on the ground that the majority opinion failed to overrule State Street explicitly. Whether this should be done was a question that the court had asked to be briefed on the re-argument. \\"I would answer that question with an emphatic 'yes.'\\" He then moved to the major thrust of his dissent: business-method patents are unconstitutional, or the patent statute must be interpreted not to extend to them in order to avoid unconstitutionality. He maintained: > The patent system is intended to protect and promote advances in science and > technology, not ideas about how to structure commercial transactions. Claim > 1 of the application . . . is not eligible for patent protection because it > is directed to a method of conducting business. Affording patent protection > to business methods lacks constitutional and statutory support, serves to > hinder rather than promote innovation and usurps that which rightfully > belongs in the public domain. State Street and AT&T; should be overruled. Pointing to the Statute of Monopolies and the public hostility to the \\"odious monopolies,\\" he concluded that when Congress enacted the first patent statute (in language substantially unchanged to this day in regard to patent- eligibility), Congress did not want the system to allow patents on methods of conducting trade.See generally Richard H. Stern, Being Within the Useful Arts as a Further Constitutional Requirement for US Patent-Eligibility, [2009] 6 (last visited July 3, 2015). State Street was a grave error. \\"Before State Street led us down the wrong path, this court had rightly concluded that patents were designed to protect technological innovations, not ideas about the best way to run a business.\\" Judge Mayer also criticized the majority opinion for doing nothing to remedy the ills of a \\"patent system [that] has run amok,\\" for evading crucial issues, and for failing to enlighten users of the patent system in regard to > three of the thorniest issues in the patentability thicket: (1) the > continued viability of business method patents, (2) what constitutes > sufficient physical transformation or machine-implementation to render a > process patentable, and (3) the extent to which computer software and > computer-implemented processes constitute statutory subject matter. =Dissent by Judge Rader= Judge Rader dissented on the ground that the majority should have \\"said in a single sentence: 'Because Bilski claims merely an abstract idea, this court affirms the Board's rejection.'\\" He then complained that instead of doing that, the majority opinion > propagates unanswerable questions: What form or amount of \\"transformation\\" > suffices? When is a \\"representative\\" of a physical object sufficiently > linked to that object to satisfy the transformation test? (E.g., Does only > vital sign data taken directly from a patient qualify, or can population > data derived in part from statistics and extrapolation be used?) What link > to a machine is sufficient to invoke the \\"or machine\\" prong? Are the > \\"specific\\" machines of Benson required, or can a general purpose computer > qualify? What constitutes \\"extra-solution activity?\\" If a process may meet > eligibility muster as a \\"machine,\\" why does the Act \\"require\\" a machine link > for a \\"process\\" to show eligibility? Judge Rader indicated his belief that nothing is wrong with patents on business methods or natural phenomena, so long as they are claimed to \\"achieve a useful, tangible, and concrete result.\\" In his view, the LabCorp dissent's criticism of that test, and of business method patents generally, misses the point of the needs of 21st century innovation and entrepreneurship. =Dissent by Judge Newman= Judge Newman dissented on the ground that the PTO should have allowed Bilski's patent. The opinion largely constitutes a debate with Judge Dyk's concurrence about whether the Statute of Monopolies, common law precedents, and the widespread opposition to the \\"odious monopolies\\" led to a ban on business-method patents in the US. Judge Newman insists that \\"[i]t is inconceivable that on this background the Framers, and again the enactors of the first United States patent statutes in 1790 and 1793, intended sub silentio to impose the limitations on 'process' now created by this court.\\" In short, Judge Newman felt that the current definition of the word process used by the court directly contradicted the statute, the precedent, and the constitutional mandate to promote the useful arts and science. Because the court's decision could affect thousands of patents already granted, Newman warned of uncertainty in patent eligible matter which serves as a disincentive to innovation. Impact Prior to the Supreme Court's decision on appeal, it was widely reported that the Bilski decision would call into question the validity of many already issued business method patents. This issue has received global news coverage with a generally favorable assessment of the judgment.Harsimran Singh, US court verdict on process patent stirs debate in India, , Nov. 1, 2008 (last viewed July 3, 2015). According to the Associated Press, the decision \\"could reshape the way banks and high-tech firms protect their intellectual property.\\"Court Rules Business Concept Cannot Be Patented, , Oct. 30, 2008 (last visited Nov. 7, 2008). Moreover, as a result of the decision, according to The Washington Post and others, many business method patents, possibly thousands, may now be invalid.Erick Schonfeld, Your Business Method Patent Has Just Been Invalidated, , Oct. 30, 2008 (last viewed Nov.12, 2008).Diane Bartz, U.S. ruling may curb business method patents, Reuters, Oct. 30, 2008 (last visited Nov. 7, 2008). Subsequent decisions by the BPAI used Bilski to reject claims related to more traditional computer implemented inventions. Four out of five of the initial rejections based on Bilski, for example, involved IBM patent applications not in the business method area.Dennis Couch, BPAI: PTO Should Apply Broadest Reasonable Claim Interpretation to Section 101 Analysis, Patently O blog, Dec. 17, 2008 (last visited July 4, 2015). In January 2009, Bilski and Warsaw petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari, seeking to overturn the Federal Circuit decision.Bilski Petitions the Supreme Court to Decide Issues of Patentable Subject Matter, Patently-O blog, Jan. 28, 2009 (last visited July 4, 2015). It was granted on June 1, 2009. (This eventually led to the Supreme Court's decision in Bilski v. Kappos.) In March 2009, a Federal Circuit panel split over what Bilski had held. In In re Ferguson the majority opinion (per Judge Gajarsa, joined by Judge Mayer) stated that Bilski has held that the \\"useful, concrete and tangible result test\\" \\"is insufficient to determine whether a claim is patent-eligible under ¬ß 101,\\" that it \\"is inadequate,\\" and that \\"those portions of our opinions in State Street and AT&T; Corp. v. Excel Communications, Inc. relying on a 'useful, concrete and tangible result' analysis should not longer be relied on.\\"In re Ferguson, . In addition, the Ferguson majority said, \\"In Bilski, this court also rejected the so-called Freeman-Walter-Abele Test, the \\"technological arts\\" test, and the \\"physical steps\\" test.\\"Ferguson, 558 F.3d at 1364 n.4. In her dissenting opinion, Judge Newman took issue with the majority opinion as an erroneous \\"sweeping rejection of precedent.\\" She insisted that Bilski had left State Street partly in effect. She argued that Bilski had \\"recognized that the State Street Bank test was directed to processes performed by computer, \\"thus meeting the Bilski test\\" and pointed to note 18 of the Bilski opinion, which stated, \\"In State Street, as is often forgotten, we addressed a claim drawn not to a process but to a machine.\\"The significance of the observation about the machine claim format in State Street is uncertain, given the Federal Circuit's repeated holdings that machine and process claims must be treated alike for purposes of statutory subject matter analysis under ¬ß 101. Compare Schonfeld with AT&T; Corp. v. Excel Communications, Inc., (\\"Whether stated implicitly or explicitly, we consider the scope of ¬ß 101 to be the same regardless of the form ‚Äî machine or process ‚Äî in which a particular claim is drafted. In fact, whether the invention is a process or a machine is irrelevant. . . . Furthermore, the Supreme Court's decisions in Diehr, Benson, and Flook, all of which involved method (i.e., process) claims, have provided and supported the principles which we apply to both machine- and process-type claims.\\"; see also State Street, 149 F.3d at 1372 (\\"For the purposes of a ¬ß 101 analysis, it is of little relevance whether claim 1 is directed to a 'machine' or a 'process,'...\\").The Supreme Court's opinion in Bilski v. Kappos is more consistent with the majority opinion than the dissent. As explained by Justice Breyer in a concurring opinion, the Court was unanimous that the State Street opinion's \\"useful, concrete and tangible result\\" test was erroneous. As to the machine-claim point, the Supreme Court's opinion in Alice v. CLS Bank expressly held that saying \\"do it on a computer\\" did not make an otherwise abstract-idea claim patent eligible. A March 2009 district court opinion interpreting Bilski \\"ponder[ed] whether the end has arrived for business method patents.\\"CyberSource Corp. v. Retail Decisions Inc., 2009 WL 815448 (N.D. Cal. Mar. 23, 2009). The court then observed: > Without expressly overruling State Street, the Bilski majority struck down > its underpinnings. This caused one dissenter, Judge Newman, to write that > State Street \\"is left hanging,\\" while another dissenter, Judge Mayer, > registered \\"an emphatic 'yes'\\" to rejecting State Street.... Although the > majority declined to say so explicitly, Bilski's holding suggests a perilous > future for most business method patents. The court concluded, \\"The closing bell may be ringing for business method patents, and their patentees may find they have become bagholders.\\" While the Supreme Court's opinion in Bilski v. Kappos, affirming the judgment but limiting the scope of the machine-or-transformation test, largely superseded the Federal Circuit's Bilski opinion as a precedent, nonetheless, much of the substantive content of the Federal Circuit majority opinion is repeated and found in the Supreme Court's Bilski opinion and subsequently in Alice as well. The statistics on invalidations under ¬ß 101, show that, as of June 2015, \\"the 73.1% invalidity rate in the federal courts breaks down into 70.2% (66 of 96) in the district courts and a stunning 92.9% in the Federal Circuit (13 for 14).\\" At the same time, final rejections of business-method patent claims before the PTO \\"soared into the 90% range.\\"Robert Sachs, #AliceStorm In June: A Deeper Dive into Court Trends, and New Data On Alice inside the USPTO, Bilskiblog.com, July 2, 2015. Specifically turning to business-method patent applications, this article provides the following summary of data: :But when it comes to business methods, we see the killer statistics: prior to Alice, prosecutors overcame the non-final ¬ß 101 rejections generally about 62% of the time, leading to final rejection rates in the 23-46% range; thus prosecutors had more or less even odds of getting over the rejection. What is shocking is that after Alice, the final rejection rate soared into the 90% range. References External links * In re Bilski (Fed.

He played for a local amateur side before joining Bristol Rovers in 1945. Lamden was a prolific goalscorer during his ten years with the club. After his professional career, he returned to amateur football. Early and personal life Lambden was born in Keynsham in 1925 to parents Arthur Lambden and Ethel Chinn, and was the youngest of four children. He had two older sisters (Joan and Frances) and one brother (Graham). Lambden married Bristol Rovers fan Grace Ford at St Anne's Church in Oldland on 28 February 1949. His brother Graham served as best man for the ceremony. Career Lambden began his footballing career playing for his local team, Oldland Abbotonians, before joining Bristol Rovers in 1945. He went on to make 269 appearances in the Football League over the next ten years, scoring 117 goals.Hugman, ed. (2015) Lambden made the best of starts to his Football League career, scoring on his debut for Rovers in the opening game of the 1946‚Äì47 season. This game, a 2‚Äì2 draw against Reading, also marked the return of League football after it was suspended during World War II.Byrne & Jay (2014) On 19 March 1948, Lambden broke the Bristol Rovers club record for the fastest hat-trick in a match. His nine-minute treble (the goals coming in the 18th, 25th and 27th minutes) in a game against Aldershot remained the club's fastest until Dai Ward scored a four-minute hat-track in 1956. As of 2016, Lambden's remains the joint second- fastest in the club's history. By the end of his time with Rovers Lambden was the club's all-time second-highest goalscorer, behind his teammate Geoff Bradford. His 117-goal tally would later be surpassed by Alfie Biggs and Harold Jarman, but he remains the fourth on the club's top goalscorers list into the 21st century. Over the period of his time playing at Eastville, Lambden had become widely known for his successful partnership with fellow forward Bradford, and the pair would later die just eighteen months apart from each other.Byrne & Jay (2003), p. 501 After retiring from professional football, Lambden dropped out of the league to play for Trowbridge Town.Byrne & Jay (2003), p. 435 References Bibliography  Category:1925 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Footballers from Bristol Category:Association football forwards Category:English footballers Category:English Football League players Category:Oldland Abbotonians F.C. players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players Category:Trowbridge Town F.C. players Category:People from Keynsham ","title":"Vic Lambden"},{"id":"20114671","text":"Class 82 may refer to: *British Rail Class 82 *DB Class 82, a German post-war steam locomotive *KTM Class 82 ","title":"Class 82"},{"id":"20114678","text":"Kod√´r-Thuman√´ is a village and a former municipality in the Durr√´s County, western Albania.

He was an inventor of heating and cook stoves, cast iron plows, and other items. His greatest success was the invention and manufacture of the platform scale, which allowed the weighing of large objects accurately. He was a co- founder of St. Johnsbury Academy.  Biography  Fairbanks was born in Brimfield, Massachusetts, on January 17, 1796, the son of Joseph Fairbanks (1763-1846) and Phebe (Paddock) Fairbanks (1760-1853). His uncle was Ephraim Paddock, the brother of Phebe Paddock. In 1815 he moved to St. Johnsbury, Vermont, and set up a wheelwright's shop above his father's gristmill.Duffy, p. 119 In 1820 he married Lucy Peck Barker. In 1824 he built an iron foundry and his brother Erastus (later Governor of Vermont) joined him to establish E. and T. Fairbanks, a partnership to manufacture heating stoves, cast iron plows, and farm implements. In 1826 he patented a cast-iron plough which was extensively used. In 1830 Fairbanks and Erastus became interested in the raising and processing of hemp. Fairbanks, being mechanically minded, made and patented a hemp and flax dressing machine at this time. He became the manager of the St. Johnsbury Hemp Company. He also built a set of scales that would measure large loads of hemp accurately, as there were no sure scales at the time that would do this. Upon the success of building these scales his brothers recommended that he make and sell these as town scales.Ullery, Men of Vermont: Illustrated Biographical History of Vermonters & Sons of Vermont. Brattleboro: Transcript Publishing Company, 1894, pp 129-133. Fairbanks obtained an agent to attempt this and remarked, Fairbanks' most famous invention then became the platform scale for weighing heavy objects. These are commonly known as the Fairbanks Scales, for which he patented a design in 1830. Before this time, accurate weighing of objects required hanging them from a balancing beam; as a result, particularly heavy or ungainly objects could not be weighed accurately. A platform scale, if large enough, could weigh an entire wagon. By placing a full wagon on the scale, unloading it, and then placing it on the scale when empty, it became possible to easily and accurately calculate the weight and value of farm produce and other loads. In 1834 Fairbanks and his brothers formed \\"E. and T. Fairbanks and Company\\" to manufacture and sell these platform scales. These scales were well known in the United States and around the world. The company doubled in volume every three years from 1842 to 1857. There was a temporary slow down during the American Civil War, however the business took off again after the war. Their partnership was incorporated in 1874 into a firm known as \\"Fairbanks Scale Company\\" and sold on a large scale.Ingham, p. 360 These platform scales revolutionized weighing methods of large loads that has been in use ever since. Portable platform scales are found in almost every hardware store, physician's office, and manufacturing factory throughout the United States. The first railway track platform scale patent was granted to Fairbanks on January 13, 1857, as Patent No. 16,381. In 1916 the company was purchased by Fairbanks, Morse and Company. Ownership of the company has since changed several times, but Fairbanks Scales continue to be made in St. Johnsbury to this day. Fairbanks received 43 patents in his lifetime with the last one at the age 91. He died on April 12, 1886, and is buried at St. Johnsbury, Vermont, at the Mount Pleasant Cemetery.  Awards  In 1826 Fairbanks received a patent on a cast iron plow and a refrigerator. In 1830 he received his patent on the platform scale known as the Fairbanks Scales. The Fairbanks family was involved in numerous charitable and civic endeavors throughout St. Johnsbury and the surrounding towns, including the 1842 founding of St. Johnsbury Academy. A painting of Thaddeus Fairbanks can be seen in the lobby of Colby Hall at St. Johnsbury Academy. Fairbanks received many foreign awards. He was even knighted by the Emperor of Austria and received honors from the Bey of Tunis, and King of Siam.

Murphy also provides other services, such as labeling, stretch wrapping, product assembly, packaging, re-pack and quality control testing-sampling. The company also offers international logistics through its Midwest International Logistics Center, which includes a designated U.S. Customs Exam Station (CES), a Container Freight Station (CFS) and a Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ), allowing for modifications to import products before they reach U.S. soil, as well as export services.  Stormwater management system  In 2008, Murphy Warehouse installed a stormwater management system at its headquarters. The system cost $580,000 to install, captures 95 percent of stormwater on a site that was more than 95 percent impervious, recharges groundwater, filters stormwater for quality, and eliminates a $68,000 annual stormwater assessment from the city. It is the first stormwater system of its kind to be voluntarily constructed on an existing, heavy use commercial site in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Murphy also installed native prairies around the stormwater system, increasing its efficiency, eliminating polluting fertilization and water waste from automatic sprinklers, and saving additional money through reduced maintenance costs of a traditional lawn. For example, at Murphy‚Äôs Fridley Campus, a similar installation requires $2,240 per year for of prairie upkeep instead of $21,650 per year for only four acres of lawn care. In January 2009, the American Council of Engineering Companies recognized Murphy and Wenck Engineers, which assisted in design and installation, with the Minnesota Engineering Excellence Honor Award for the stormwater system. Minneapolis mayor R.T. Rybak proclaimed it, ‚Äúthe single best green value that I can see in Minneapolis,‚Äù on Earth Day, April 22, 2009.

She was formerly named Berta de Perez, but her name was changed at sea to Ranga, due to the Icelandic charter. The Ranga was on her maiden voyage from Vigo to Reykjav√≠k under Captain Miguel √Ångel D√≠az Madariaga. The ship lost power on this voyage during a storm, and was wrecked at at Dunmore Head, close to Coumeenole Beach, near Slea Head on the Dingle peninsula, County Kerry, Ireland on 11 March 1982. Rescue The local rescue team comprising members of Dingle Fire Brigade, An Garda S√≠och√°na and emergency services, rescued some of the fifteen crew members by Breeches buoy. The remainder were taken off by an RAF helicopter. Captain Miguel √Ångel D√≠az Madariaga was the last to be rescued and dropped off the vessel. Disposal The ship was a total loss and created oil pollution as she broke up. The ship broke into two parts quickly, the stern of the ship, with the superstructure on, and the bows. In 1989, the company Eurosalve tried to scrap her, but this failed due to the inaccessibility of the wreck. The stern section of the wreck was removed in 1991, due to filming of Far and Away, which included a scene shot at Dunmore Head.

It was closely associated with the Whitney family until its acquisition by Charles W. Morse in 1906. Even after being merged into Eastern Steamship Lines, it was maintained as a distinct service, the Metropolitan Line, until 1941. Metropolitan Steamship Company =Early history= The Metropolitan Steamship Company was established by Boston business interests soon after the end of the American Civil War in 1866 to operate steamships on the \\"outside route\\" between Boston and New York City around Cape Cod. The company was organized in February 1866 by Peter Butler, James B. Taft, Thomas Clyde, Brigadier General James Scollay Whitney, and Whitney's elder son, Henry Melville Whitney. One of the objectives of the investors was to place in remunerative service vessels they owned which were presently idle.John Harrison Morrison, History of American Steam Navigation, p. 403. New York: W.F. Sametz & Co., Inc., 1908.Francis B.C. Bradlee, \\"Some Account of Steam Navigation in New England\\", Essex Institute Historical Collections, Vol. XVI, No. 3 (July 1920), pp. 181‚Äì182. James S.

Whitney was named agent at Boston.The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, Vol. X, pp. 154‚Äì155. New York: James T. White & Company, 1909. Reprint of 1900 edition. Other members of the family eventually became financially interested in the company, including Whitney's younger son, William Collins Whitney, and his sons-in-law, Henry F. Dimock and Charles T. Barney. Service was inaugurated in 1866 by Captain George L. Norton with the steamer Ashland, a wooden propeller of 843 gross tons, built in 1853 at Philadelphia and owned by Thomas Clyde. The Ashland was soon followed into service by the Jersey Blue, City of Bath, Mary Sanford, Salvor, Relief, Miami, Monticello and Fairbanks. Oldest of these was the Jersey Blue, a 368-ton, 133-foot wooden propeller built in 1850 at Newark, New Jersey. All were propellers except the Miami, a sidewheeler built in 1861‚Äì62 by the Philadelphia Navy Yard as the gunboat USS Miami and sold for mercantile use in 1865.Robert Gardiner (ed. dir.), Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860‚Äì1905, p. 130. London: Conway Maritime Press, 1979. The line's New York offices were at first located at the foot of Catherine Street, East River, but soon moved to Pier 10, North River, where they remained for nearly half a century.Bradlee, p. 182. In December 1866 the wooden propellers Nereus, Glaucus and Neptune were purchased from the failed Merchants' Steamship Company. Built in 1864, each was a vessel of 1,800 tons and measured 228 feet in length with a beam of 40 feet. Their hulls had to be strengthened, as they had been built for the more protected waters of Long Island Sound, not the open seas beyond Point Judith. Simple expansion steam engines gave a speed of 13 knots.Bradlee, p. 183. =Iron steamships= The line's first iron-hulled propeller, the General Whitney, was built in 1873 by Harlan & Hollingsworth at Wilmington, Delaware. A vessel of 1,848 tons, she measured 227 feet in length with a beam of 40 feet, and was propelled by two-cylinder compound engines.Morrison, op. cit. All of the company's iron steamers were designed by Herman Winter, the line's chief engineer from 1872 to 1891. Upon the death of James Whitney on October 24, 1878, Henry Whitney was elected his successor as president of the steamship line. In addition, he retained the office of agent at Boston.The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography, op. cit. In 1884 the 2,625-toon iron propeller H.F. Dimock was built by William Cramp & Sons at Philadelphia and named for the line's New York agent. A similar 2,625-ton, 274-foot iron propeller, the Herman Winter, was built by Cramps in 1887. Both had two-cylinder compound engines. With the construction of the 2,706-ton, 288-foot H.M. Whitney, powered by triple expansion engines at the Cramp shipyard in 1890, the line possessed four modern iron propellers ‚Äì the General Whitney, H.F. Dimock, Herman Winter and H.M. Whitney, and the older wooden propellers Glaucus and Neptune (the Nereus having been lost while a barge).Morrison, op. cit. =Into the 20th century= While on her customary route from New York to Boston the steamer H.F. Dimock collided with William K. Vanderbilt's yacht, the Alva, in the Pollock Rip Slough, a narrow channel of Vineyard Sound, on July 24, 1892, sinking the Alva. Captain Henry Morrison of the Alva filed suit against the H.F. Dimock, but both the United States District Court for Massachusetts and the United States Supreme Court ruled against him.\\"The Alva-Dimock Decision. Points Made in It That Are Interesting to Lawyers\\", The New York Times, January 5, 1893. The H.M. Whitney was involved in a serious accident while still in harbor on September 28, 1892. While bound from Boston to New York, at 7 p.m. the H.M. Whitney was run down and sunk in Boston harbor by the transatlantic steamer Ottoman of the Warren Line, bound from Liverpool to Boston. No lives were lost,\\"Sunk in Boston Harbor. The H.M. Whitney Run Down by the Ottoman\\", The New York Times, September 29, 1892. and the H.M. Whitney was refloated and reconditioned for further service In 1893 the firm of Flint & Company purchased the steamer El Cid of the Morgan Line and outfitted her as an auxiliary cruiser named Nichtheroy(sold to United States Navy and renamed as USS Buffalo (1892)) for service in the Brazilian Civil War of 1893‚Äì94. At one point it was reported that Flint & Company wished to purchase the H.F. Dimock or Herman Winter from Metropolitan, but nothing came of it.\\"Adding to Brazil's Fleet. Flint & Co. May Buy a Metropolitan Line Steamship\\", The New York Times, November 4, 1893.Built in 1892 at Newport News, Virginia, the Nichtheroy (ex-El Cid) was commissioned in 1898 as the auxiliary cruiser , later becoming a training ship in 1900, a transport in 1906 and a destroyer tender (AD-8) in 1918. From 1922 until her sale in 1927 she was used as a barracks ship. Robert Gardiner (ed. dir.), Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860‚Äì1905, p. 168. The Glaucus and Neptune were withdrawn from service in 1893 and laid up at Brooklyn, New York, where they remained until July 1906, when they were finally towed to Boston for breaking up.Bradlee, p. 184. In 1898 the General Whitney was chartered by the Morgan Line for service between New Orleans and New York. While carrying copper ingots and barrel molasses she sprang a leak and sank off St. Augustine, Florida, on April 23, 1899. Lifeboats were launched, but as they came ashore in the surf one capsized, drowning Captain Hawthrone and 16 men. When the Joy Steamship Company established its New York City-Providence, Rhode Island service in 1899, the company also instituted freight-only service between New York and Boston. The Joy Line was acquired by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1906, ending its freight service to Boston.George W. Hilton, The Night Boat, p. 89. Berkeley, California: Howell- North Books, 1968. On January 23, 1900, the Herman Winter was bound from New York to Boston when she collided with the freighter Ardendhu of the Munson Line off Robinson's Hole, Vineyard Sound. The Ardendhu sank with the loss of two crew members, but the Herman Winter brought 29 survivors into Vineyard Haven.\\"Steamer Ardendhu Sunk. Rammed by the Herman Winter in Vinyard Sound\\", The New York Times, January 24, 1900. In 1900 the 2,707-ton, 278-foot steamer James S. Whitney was built to replace the lost General Whitney. Built by Harlan & Hollingsworth at Wilmington, this modern steel propeller was powered by triple expansion engines. The annual passenger season for the line was from May to November. In 1903 the line's steamers left India Wharf, Boston, for New York daily at 4 p.m.Edwin M. Bacon, Boston. A Guide Book, Section V. Boston: Ginn & Company, 1903. The evening sailing in the opposite direction from New York was from Pier 14, North River. =Charles W. Morse gains control= Originally chartered in Massachusetts, the Metropolitan Steamship Company was reincorporated in May 1905 in Maine.In subsequent litigation, this corporation was termed \\"Metropolitan Steamship Company of Maine No. 1\\". \\"Steamship Deal Puzzled Mellen. Had No Hand in Shifting Morse's Boston Boats to the Pacific, He Testifies\\", The New York Times, May 29, 1914. In 1906 Whitney and his associates sold a controlling interest in the company to Charles W. Morse of the Eastern Steamship Company. Whitney later said this was the worst mistake he ever made.Bradlee, pp. 184‚Äì185. Morse organized the Consolidated Steamship Company in January 1907 as a holding company for Metropolitan as well as Eastern Steamship Company, Clyde Steamship Company and Mallory Steamship Company. Despite an initial announcement of such a sale, Morse failed in his attempt to purchase the Long Island Sound fleet of the New York, New Haven and Hartford.\\"Morse Buys Sound Lines From New Haven\\", The New York Times, February 7, 1907. He did, however, acquire control of the New York and Cuba Mail Steamship Company and the New York and Porto Rico Steamship Company in 1907. In 1906‚Äì07 the steamers Harvard and were built by the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding & Engine Works (the operator of the old John Roach shipyard) at Chester, Pennsylvania, for a Metropolitan subsidiary, the Metropolitan Steamship Company of New Jersey. Each of the 3,731-ton steel propellers measured 407 feet in length with a beam of 61 feet, and had accommodations for 987 overnight passengers. Amongst the first American ships to be fitted with steam turbines, the two ships had a maximum speed of 24 knotsBradlee, p. 185; Hilton, pp. 236‚Äì237. and upon entering service were the fastest American- flagged vessels afloat. Owing to the highly leveraged nature of his financing, the Morse business empire crashed in the Panic of 1907. The Metropolitan Steamship Company went into receivership in February 1908.\\"Ask Receivers For Morse Ship Lines. Bondholders Act in Maine, Boston, and This City to Protect Their Interests\\", The New York Times, January 31, 1908. The H.M. Whitney was outbound from New York to Boston with passengers and freight when a failure of her steering gear caused her to run aground in the Hell Gate channel of the East River on the afternoon of May 23, 1908. After floating off on a rising tide, she anchored in mid-channel, where her lights were concealed by a heavy fog that lay over the river and Long Island Sound all that evening and night. Fortunately, damage was minor, and she was able to proceed when the fog cleared.\\"Steamer Hits in Hell Gate. The H.M. Whitney Strikes Rock, but Floats Off and Anchors in Fog\\", The New York Times, May 24, 1908. During 1907 three modern steamers, the Massachusetts, Bunker Hill and Old Colony, had been built by Cramps at Philadelphia as package freighters for the Maine Steamship Company, a New Haven subsidiary. Each of the 4,029-ton steel propellers measured 395 feet in length with a beam of 52 feet three inches. The Massachusetts and Bunker Hill were propelled by steam turbines while the Old Colony had reciprocating engines. They were running between New York, Boston and Portland on what was called the Boston Merchants' Line when Charles Sanger Mellen of the New Haven sold a controlling interest in the trio to Morse in 1908.Hilton, pp. 38‚Äì39, 99, 111. In the meantime, Morse had been indicted for his role in precipitating the Panic of 1907. He was sentenced to federal prison in November 1908 for violation of federal banking laws but remained free on appeal until January 1910. =Corporate restructuring= On March 10, 1909, the H.F. Dimock, bound from New York to Boston, and the coastwise steamer Horatio Hall of the Maine Steamship Company collided in the eastern Vineyard Sound shortly after 8 a.m. while sailing at half speed in a heavy fog. The accident occurred in Pollock Rip Slue, not far from where the H.F. Dimock had collided with the Alva in 1892. Captain John A. Thompson of the H.F. Dimock brought his vessel alongside the Horatio Hall so that the latter's five passengers could be transferred. The Horatio Hall sank at the edge of the channel. Most of her crew left in lifeboats and were picked up by the H.F. Dimock, but Captain W. Frank Jewell, the pilot, first mate, and two seamen remained in the pilot house, which remained a few feet above water. (They were picked up later.) The H.F. Dimock left the scene at 11:15 a.m. and sailed slowly toward Orleans Life-Saving Station,Located in southeastern Cape Cod, the Orleans station was built in 1872‚Äì73.

No passengers were on board at the time.\\"Steamer on Hell Gate Rock. The Captain Says He Was Forced Out of Channel and Tide Swung Him\\", The New York Times, December 19, 1909. Early on July 15, 1910, the James S. Whitney was again in trouble while bound from New York to Boston with a cargo of wool, cotton and oil. She passed Point Judith at 5:30 a.m. and caught fire about half an hour later. In an attempt to reach Vineyard Haven she ran onto the western end of Middle Ground Shoals in Vineyard Sound at 8 a.m. The steamer backed off the shoal at 11:45 a.m. and, accompanied by the revenue cutter Acushnet, safely reached Vineyard Haven. Contained in one section of the cargo hold, the fire continued to smolder for a couple days but was finally extinguished.\\"Ship's Cargo on Fire. Steamer James S. Whitney Manages to Reach Vineyard Unaided\\", The New York Times, July 16, 1910. On the afternoon of the next day, July 16, 1910, fire destroyed Piers 14 and 15 on the North River in New York City. The H.F. Dimock of the Metropolitan Steamship Company and the Altemaha of the Brunswick Line were able to leave their berths with some damage, but two sailors from the H.F. Dimock panicked and were drowned. The Harvard suffered only some blistered paint and was able to sail on her evening departure for Boston from Pier 9.\\"Million Dollar Fire Sweeps Two Piers. Metropolitan and Brunswick Lines Homeless After a Spectacular Blaze\\", The New York Times, July 17, 1910.Pier 14 was rebuilt. Later, after Metropolitan was consolidated with Eastern Steamship Company and vacated Pier 14, it became the terminus of the Fall River Line, which remained there until its operations ended in 1937. Hilton, p. 59. Later in 1910 the Harvard and Yale were leased for $360,000 a year to the Pacific Navigation Company for service between San Francisco and Los Angeles. After a voyage by way of the Strait of Magellan to California, they entered service in December 1910. Sailings were extended to San Diego in 1911. Leased by H.F. Alexander's Admiral Line for service on the same route in 1916, they saw war service in 1918 as military ferries on the English Channel, a locale for which they were well suited. Later, they were operated on their old California coastwise route by the Los Angeles Steamship Company.Bradlee, p. 185; Hilton, pp. 236‚Äì245. Metropolitan Line For the 1911 season the Massachusetts, Bunker Hill and Old Colony sailed between New York, Boston and Portland, Maine, for the Maine Steamship Company. In 1911 the Metropolitan Steamship Company and Maine Steamship Company were consolidated with the Eastern Steamship Company to form the Eastern Steamship Corporation. The Massachusetts and Bunker Hill were sent to the Cramp yard in 1912 for the addition of passenger accommodations and conversion to oil fuel. Their sister, the Old Colony, remained coal- fired.Bradlee, p. 186; Hilton, pp. 38‚Äì39, 99. The line went into receivership in 1914, but emerged in 1917 as Eastern Steamship Lines. The company's Boston- New York service, the Metropolitan Line, began using the Cape Cod Canal in 1916.Hilton, p. 99. During World War I the James S. Whitney Renamed \\"Pinango Lara\\" [Cuban]and H.M. Whitney were sold to foreign interests, reportedly for $400,000 each, for ocean service. The H.F. Dimock and Herman Winter were also sold during this period and placed in the banana trade between Mobile, Alabama, and Bocas del Toro, Panama.Bradlee, pp. 186‚Äì187.Years later, the Herman Miller was lost, oddly enough, in one of her old haunts, the Vineyard Sound. On March 7, 1944, while owned by the War Shipping Administration, she was wrecked under the cliffs of Gay Head at the western end of Martha's Vineyard. After the United States' entry into World War I, the Massachusetts and Bunker Hill were purchased by the United States Navy in 1917 and converted into minelayers as the (later AK-44) and USS Shawmut (CM-4) (later ).Hilton, p. 99; Robert Gardiner (ed. dir.), Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1906‚Äì1921, p. 133.

In 1924 the steamers Boston and New York were built for the service;Hilton, pp. 99, 113. they were joined at peak periods by the North Land.Hilton, p. 108. Sailings on the Metropolitan Line had always been summer-only, but Eastern assigned the steamers George Washington and Robert E. Lee to the route in the off season from 1927 to 1932. When the steamers Saint John and Acadia were built in 1932, Saint John was assigned to the Boston-Saint John, New Brunswick route in the summer, with the Acadia on a new route between New York and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. In the off season both were assigned to the Metropolitan Line.Hilton, pp. 99‚Äì100, 112, 117. Service on Eastern's various routes was gradually reduced in the 1930s. The steamer New York left Manhattan on the last sailing of the Metropolitan Line on November 29, 1941.Hilton, p. 100.

From an opium master in southeast Asia to a UN drug enforcement officer on the border of Afghanistan hunting down the smugglers of Central Asia; from a former Indian government Drug Czar and opium farmer to a crusading Vancouver doctor and Portuguese street worker who daily confront the realities of drug addiction. Shown is the pivotal role that has been played by the opium poppy, not just in the lives of people who grow, manufacture and use it but also in the increasingly-tense sphere of international relations.

A nurse by profession, she is a member of the Seychelles National Party, and was first elected to the Assembly on a proportional basis in 2001.Rebel with a cause- Regina Alcindor of Seychelles The cataract in Regina Alcindor‚Äôs eyes vanished on the day she failed to get her long overdue promotion. ‚ÄúNot getting my promotion made me conscious that I was ignorant of the critical mass of women who were suffering like me.‚Äù Alcindor believes that she suffered victimisation in her job because she showed sympathy for the opposition party. ‚ÄúOvernight all the valuable work I was doing as a qualified nurse was being questioned.‚Äù Alcindor‚Äôs source of unhappiness cemented a plan for the happiness of others. ‚ÄúI decided to work for those who needed me most.‚Äù She quit a well-paid job to work for a lower salary as the coordinator of the opposition Seychelles National Party. ‚ÄúMy belief has no price. As a full time politician I was in a better position to help others.‚Äù There are nine women ruling party parliamentarians and two women opposition parliamentarians (compared to 19 and 7 men respectively) in the Seychelles parliament. Alcindor joined the opposition party and in 1991 formed part in a group of politicians who fought for the establishment of a multi-party system in 1992, paving the way for general elections in 1993. She became an ardent member of the ‚ÄúParti Seychellois‚Äù, as her party was known at the time. Alcindor made her first public speech for the 1998 general elections on mother‚Äôs day. ‚ÄúI was raw, afraid and trembling like a leaf and thought I would be booed from all corners.‚Äù Instead, the public rushed towards her to congratulate her. ‚ÄúFrom that day I decided not to deceive all those who believe in me and who trust me.‚Äù She stood for the 1998 elections but did not win. But this spurred her on ‚Äúto fight for my children and fight for my country.‚Äù So she quit her nursing job to go into full time politics for the party now called the Seychelles National Party. She stood again in the same constituency in December 2002 against two male candidates and won. In an interview before the elections, she said she saw race (the male candidates were white) as being more against her than her sex: a tribute to the extent to which Seychelles is at ease with women in politics- even in opposition. ‚ÄúThe first time, I was a new candidate and did not have that much influence on voters.‚Äù The second time around she had done her homework. ‚ÄúAfter being in politics full time for five years, it was a different campaign.‚Äù Gender equality is an issue on which Alcindor has strong views: ‚ÄúIt is not proper that half of the population is not getting fair treatment. Gender equality is important because the world cannot keep on moving with only men ruling. Issues that are not important to men are important to women. Women have the responsibility and the capability to address social issues more than men. Women are fighters. They rebel for a cause and will not stop fighting until they reach their goal. The determination of a woman is stronger than that of a man because she believes in the well being of people in general.‚Äù Alcindor believes that the fact that women express emotions makes them better politicians: ‚ÄúWomen have gut feelings. They are the guardian of moral values and their voices must count.‚Äù She says for her gender is not something theoretical. Her everyday life is all about gender equality. A mother of three, Alcindor is divorced but lives with a partner of 13 years who is very supportive of her political career. She is the breadwinner in her family. This does not bother her partner who is a casual worker. ‚Äù When I am very busy with my political work or during electoral campaign my partner takes complete responsibility for the house. Without his support and that of my mother it would have been difficult for me to fulfil my obligations. I sometimes represent my party on conferences outside Seychelles.‚Äù For example, Alcindor attended a meeting of the African Women‚Äôs Leadership Forum in Accra, and a meeting on gender and NEPAD in Johannesburg in June 2002 hosted by Deputy Speaker Baleka Kgositsile-Mbete. While opposition parties in Seychelles do not always have a smooth ride, Alcindor has regular meetings with her caucus group in her constituency. She also represents her constituency at the National Women Organisation Commission of her party where major issues like breast cancer, child pregnancy, and infant mortality are discussed. Together with eleven men and four women she sits on the Executive Committee of the party. ‚ÄúAlthough women are under- represented we have the same rights and our voices are heard.‚Äù A major constraint voiced by opposition parties in Seychelles is finding venues to meet with constituents. Alcindor is adding a room to her house, which will serve as an office for meetings. At the moment she is counting on friends but some are reluctant as not all belong to the same political party. ‚ÄúWe will become easy targets of victimization and our children might lose their jobs,‚Äù said one female respondent of the focus group of the opposition party. The other three female respondents on the same panel agreed with her. The male focus group with opposition party supporters said the same thing. The focus groups were carried out in a modest place far from town under a veranda that could hardly sit six persons. Alcindor also does door to door calls in her constituency three times a week to make sure that their problems are solved. ‚ÄúContrary to what my opponents says I do not mix issues. I am the Chairperson of two committees of the Parents Teachers Association and I have been doing that for the past twelve years. I am proud to say that I have brought lots of reforms in the school. Parents, teachers and the administrative staff have a better relationship. As the Secretary of my church, I have brought up very positive reforms. I have set up a committee with the young to better understand their problems and their dislike for the church. Now they are on the Eucharistic committee. We sometimes celebrate masses, sing for funerals and weddings. We also do lots of community work together.‚Äù One of Alcindor‚Äôs main concerns is finding proper accommodation for vulnerable groups. She is confident that her negotiations with the Ministry of Land and Habitat will bear fruit. Both female and male focus groups of the opposition party agreed- as one member of the group put it- ‚ÄúWe admire her courage and her commitment. Women in our party are doing a fantastic job and we must give them all the support possible. They are working long hours for us. Having a gender lens is of utmost important in places like hospitals, schools or even in building a house.‚Äù But Alcindor has had a tough time in other quarters, including bruising brushes with the media: The media reported what my opponents said without verification. My private life, the loan on my house, my work at the church and my social work not only became public but they poured scorn on me. My opponents used the most powerful tool, the media to downgrade me. Nobody was spared in my family. I was humiliated in political meetings, in the newspapers and in tracks that were distributed all over the place. I was accused of not paying the loan on my house. I was accused of bringing politics to my church and to the school where my children go. One day I was horrified to find the four tyres of my car slashed. My opponents even said that I was uneducated and they called me ‚Äòbal sarbon‚Äô ‚Äòmarsoin‚Äô (sack of coal, black dolphin). The lies were so grotesque that I preferred not to reply. I am a very religious person. I believe in God and my prayers are helping me to surmount all my problems.

The layout was broadly similar to that of the BV 141: the crew and weapons were carried in a large nacelle offset from the main fuselage structure that carried a propeller-driven engine in the nose and the empennage at the rear, joined together by a common wing. However, in the P 194, a turbojet was added low down at the rear of the crew nacelle and the thrust from this engine was intended to help balance the thrust from the propeller. A powerful cluster of guns was to be located in the nose of the nacelle, clear of the propeller, and a bombload of up to 500 kg (1,100 lb) was to be carried in an internal bomb bay in the fuselage.Myhra 1998, 68 Using a high proportion of steel in its structure, the design of the P 194 was simplified by using a significant number of parts from other projects, notably the BV 155 prototype and earlier BV 237 asymmetric stuka proposal.Cowin (1963). =Variants= ;P 194.00-101:version with 16 m (52 ft) wingspan and jet intake under cockpit pod ;P 194.01-02:version with 15.3 m (50.2 ft) wingspan, bubble canopy and jet intake under cockpit pod ;P 194.02-01:as above, but with turbojet located beneath cockpit ;P 194.03-01:as P 194.01-02, but with jet intakes located in the wing roots at the sides of the cockpit pod.

Background From the 13th century in England and Wales, equity developed as a system of justice in parallel with and complementary to the common law. By the 19th century, with the rise of capitalism in Victorian Britain, equity had become very important. The remedies available to the common law were limited to damages and those disputes demanding an injunction or specific performance of a contract needed to be heard in equity which was administered in Courts of Chancery, separate from the common law courts. Moreover, procedure in equity was better able to handle complex disputes involving the relationship between several parties such as partnerships and trusts.Lobban (2004a) However, the dual jurisdiction of law and equity caused problems for litigants. In equity, all parties had to be represented at all hearings and if one died or married complex procedures were needed to maintain the action. The rate of progress of the action was in the hands of the parties and would tend to be determined by the slowest. Many uncontroversial administrative actions, such as appointing a new trustee, were dealt with as though they were contentious, adding further delay. There were many inefficiencies in procedure with high costs and a certain amount of corruption. Further, cases that involved questions of both law and equity would be hampered, shuttling between the courts of Chancery and common law courts for years, as in Wood v. Scarth.(1855) 2 K&J; 33 The Chancery commission (1824‚Äì26) made recommendations on streamlining procedure but the commissioners concluded that the Chancery courts themselves had the powers to improve matters. Over the following decades there was much debate leading to legislation including the Improvement of the Jurisdiction of Equity Act 1852 which allowed Chancery judges to decide questions of fact rather than remitting them to the common law courts. However, by 1862, Chancery judges were still reluctant to make use of these powers so Attorney General Sir John Rolt introduced a bill to make determination of facts by Chancery judges mandatory.Lobban (2004b) The Act The purpose of the Act was to require the Court of Chancery to determine every issue of fact or law necessary for the final resolution of the case, and thus to end the practice of sending particular issues in cases pending in Chancery, to be determined in the common law courts. In the end, the Act was weakened from its initial intentions, allowing matters of fact to referred by a Chancery Judge to be decided by the assizes.Hansard HC Deb 26 March 1862 vol 166 cc114-22 114 The Act applied to the High Court of Chancery of England and Wales and also to the Court of Chancery of the County Palatine of Lancaster which had an independent jurisdiction in equity.Rickards (1862) A further Act brought a similar reform to Ireland.Chancery Regulation (Ireland) Act 1862, c. 46 Subsequent developments The fusion of the administration of law and equity was finally effected in the 1870s by the Judicature Acts.

Rosner, who was Jewish, survived the Holocaust in Nazi concentration camps during World War II by playing his accordion for Nazi officials. This earned the attention of Oskar Schindler, who saved his life by having him placed on his famous list. His story became known after Australian author Thomas Keneally's 1982 novel, Schindler's Ark, was adapted into Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning film, Schindler's List. He appeared in the epilogue of the film at the Schindler's grave on Mount Zion.  Life  = Early life = Rosner was born in Krak√≥w, Poland on 26 June 1918. He was one of nine children in a family that performed in the music business. = The Holocaust = Rosner was a successful cabaret artist and entertainer in Krak√≥w, Poland by the time the country was invaded and occupied by Nazi Germany in 1939. The Rosner family fled to the rural town of Tyniece, where they played in barns for food. They were soon caught and sent to the Krak√≥w Ghetto, where they lived in cramped and dangerous conditions. Leo continued to play music with his brother, Henry Rosner. Leo played the accordion, and Henry played the violin. They played at the ghetto's cafes, where he met his wife, Helen (born 1924). They were married on 17 January 1943, but on his wedding night Leo was deported to P≈Çasz√≥w concentration camp without her. Helen and her sister, Janka, was deported to the P≈Çasz√≥w that March. While at P≈Çasz√≥w, Rosner, along with his brother Henry, were forced to perform for the notorious camp commandant Amon G√∂th. Rosner's talent with his accordion earned him the attention of Oskar Schindler. Schindler had Rosner and his surviving family members moved to his camp in Brnƒõnec, Czech Protectorate, in 1945. However, Rosner's wife, Helen, along with the other female Schindlerjuden, including Henry's wife Manci, were transferred to the notorious Auschwitz concentration camp. After a harrowing few weeks, Schindler was able to bribe camp officials to have them transferred out. The couple was reunited at Schindler's camp, the Br√ºnnlitz labor camp, where they remained in relative safety until the end of World War II, when the camp was liberated by the Red Army. = Post World War II = Leo and Helen Rosner immigrated to Australia in 1949 and settled in Melbourne. The couple had two daughters, Frances Rosner and Anna Rosner Blay. He worked as a musician and eventually fronted a twelve piece band. He continued to perform into his eighties. He was well known in the Melbourne musician business as well as in the Australian Holocaust survivors community. He traveled to Mount Zion in Jerusalem for the 1993 film Schindler's List to appear in the film's epilogue with other Schindlerjuden paying their respects at the grave of Oskar Schindler. Rosner suffered from Alzheimer's disease in his later years, but was still able to perform at his and Helen's 65th wedding anniversary celebration in 2008. = Death = Leo Rosner died on 10 October 2008, at the age of 90, of complications from Alzheimer's disease in Melbourne, Australia. He was survived by his wife, Helen Rosner, who was 84 years old at the time of Leo's death. Rosner was also survived by his two daughters, six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. His funeral was held at Melbourne Chevra Kadisha Cemetery in Springvale, Victoria. His wife, Helen Rosner, died in 2010 after suffering from heart problems and Parkinson's disease, at age 86.

The team worked for World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). They were the first-ever Unified WWE Tag Team Champions, being holders of both the WWE Tag Team Championship and World Tag Team Championship. Their father is former professional wrestler Carlos Col√≥n Sr., and they initially began teaming together in his promotion, World Wrestling Council and held the WWC World Tag Team Championship. In 2008, they began teaming together in WWE, when Primo debuted on SmackDown alongside his brother. In their debut as a tag team within the promotion, they defeated then-WWE Tag Team Champions Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder. This win earned them a title opportunity two weeks later, in which they were also successful. At WrestleMania XXV they became the first team to unify both tag team title sets by defeating John Morrison and The Miz. History =World Wrestling Council= The Col√≥ns initially began teaming in their father's company, World Wrestling Council (WWC) to defeat the tag team of Thunder and Lightning for the WWC World Tag Team Championship on March 16, 2002. They lost the title to Thunder and Lightning the following day. At Lockout 2009, the brothers performed in the promotion for the first time since teaming in WWE. Although they were not booked in a match, The Col√≥ns hosted a segment of Carlito's Cabana with David Sierra as the invited guest. In this segment, the promotion tried to explain why Eddie was renamed to \\"Primo\\", claiming that he wanted to preserve Eddie Guerrero's legacy by not using his actual name. On May 20, 2009, The Col√≥ns issued an open challenge to any tag team for Aniversario 2009, the promotion's anniversary event. =World Wrestling Entertainment= Unified WWE Tag Team Champions (2008‚Äì2009) The Col√≥ns as WWE Tag Team Champions Soon after Primo debuted in WWE, he became a full-time member of the SmackDown! roster, along with his brother. They defeated WWE Tag Team Champions Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder in their first match as a team to gain victory on September 12, 2008. Two weeks later, both teams competed in a title match, with The Col√≥ns winning to become tag team champions. The Col√≥ns as the Unified Tag Team Champions Starting in November, The Col√≥ns developed an on-screen relationship with The Bella Twins (Nikki and Brie), appearing in numerous backstage segments with them and The Bellas accompanied them to the ring. This relationship with the Bella Twins subsequently led to a feud with the World Tag Team Champions John Morrison and The Miz, as Morrison and The Miz flirted with The Bella Twins, and then defeated Carlito and Primo to win a date with them on Valentine's Day. The Bella were seemingly unable to choose between the teams, leading to Morrison and The Miz challenging The Col√≥ns for the WWE Tag Team Championship, and The Col√≥ns challenging Morrison and The Miz for the World Tag Team Championship, although each team retained their respective championship. The rivalry between the teams led The Bella Twins to fall out with each other, with Brie siding with the Col√≥ns, and Nikki siding with Morrison and The Miz. On the WrestleMania XXV pre-show, The Col√≥ns defeated Morrison and The Miz to win the World Tag Team Championship and become the Unified WWE Tag Team Champions, and they successfully defended the championships the following night on Raw. On April 15, the Col√≥ns were drafted back to the Raw brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental Draft. On April 27, the Col√≥ns made their debut on Raw, defeating Jamie Noble and Chavo Guerrero. The team's collective WWE Superstars debut took place on May 28, 2009, when they defeated The World's Greatest Tag Team by pinfall. Split and brief reformation (2009‚Äì2010) They lost the championship at The Bash to the team of Edge and Chris Jericho, who were added to a standard tag team match between the Col√≥ns and The Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase) moments before the match started. Carlito and Primo invoked their rematch clause the next night on Raw, but were unsuccessful, and on the July 6 episode of Raw, they lost again to Jericho and Edge. One week later, the team officially disbanded when Carlito attacked Primo. The team reunited on the May 6, 2010 episode of Superstars when Carlito stopped the match and offered Primo to reform as a team. Primo accepted the offer, turning him heel in the process. On the May 10 episode of Raw, Col√≥ns brutally attacked R-Truth. The duo then shook hands with Ted DiBiase after getting paid with DiBiase's \\"Trust Fund.\\" The reunion of the team would be short lived, as on May 21, Carlito was released due to a violation of the WWE Wellness Program and subsequent refusal to attend a rehabilitation facility.http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/carlitoreleased While Primo went on to form the second incarnation of The Col√≥ns, with their cousin Epico.

On 4 June 1980, the police moved in and evicted the camp.  History  = Background = The Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt conducted drilling in Gorleben in 1979 to test the salt domes there for suitability in storing radioactive waste. After small occupations by local activists at drill sites 1002 and 1003 failed, a plan was set in motion for a bigger occupation action that would include international anti-nuclear activists. A new demonstration was called for on 3 May 1980, under the motto \\"Day of action for the Wends\\" (Kampftag der Wenden). = Occupation = Around 5000 anti-nuclear activists moved to the planned area around drilling site 1004, between the villages of Gorleben and Trebel. There they occupied the area as part of a protest against further drilling to store nuclear waste. During the occupation, the so-called \\"Underground Office of Gorleben-Shall-Live\\" (Untergrundamt Gorleben-Soll- leben) declared the occupied area as an independent nation, naming it the Free Republic of Wendland (Republik Freies Wendland). The Lower-Saxon Minister of the Interior Egbert M√∂cklinghoff declared this proclamation to be high treason. Wendenpass, taken 3 May 1980 The site was created on sandy soil and burned trees that was destroyed during the Fire on the L√ºneburg Heath in 1975. On this location, the protesters built over the course of several days a village of around 110 huts, made from wood and clay, which was a typical style of protest for anti-nuclear activists at the time.Photo of the hut village Among the buildings were numerous community facilities, such as the 100-person-capacity Friendship House, greenhouses, an infirmary, a hairdressing salon and an area for waste disposal. There was also a sauna and bathing facilities. Water was piped in by a wind-powered well and warmed with solar power. On the approach to the \\"republic\\", a border checkpoint with a boom barrier was built, over which the flags of the Wends and of the Anti- Nuclear-Sun were hoisted.Gorleben-Archiv: Village History of the Free Republic of Wendland. Hut Village on 1004 (Dorfgeschichte Freie Republik Wendland.

They established a spokespersons council and made decisions in regularly occurring mass meetings. Regarding their possible eviction by police, the widespread consensus was that of passive resistance, though a few militant occupiers spoke against this course. On the weekends, several thousand sympathizers and sightseers came to the occupied site, among them prominent people, such as the former head of the \\"Young Socialists\\", Gerhard Schr√∂der. Other well-known visitors and residents included the resistance fighter Heinz Brandt, the musicians Walter Mossmann and Wolf Biermann, the photographer G√ºnter Zint and the SPD politician Jo Leinen, as well as the writer Klaus Schlesinger. The group decision-making process took place both in the Friendship House as well as at other equally suitable platforms. These places also hosted lectures, discussions, readings, rock concerts, and puppet shows. Residents of the surrounding region supported the occupation with food and timber.NDR Recap: We are the lucky ones. The Free Republic of Wendland (NDR-R√ºckschau: Wir sind die Gl√ºcklichen.

Around 3500 officers took part in the operation, according to the Lower Saxony Ministry of the Interior and of Sports.Venceremos, Goodbye. DER SPIEGEL. Published 14 July 1980 Legal grounds for the eviction of the occupiers were based on violations of various laws, including forestry laws, building regulations, the Field and Forest Planning Act, and the Registration Act.

Long after the occupation by anti-nuclear activists of the Wendland was concluded, the concept of the Free Republic of Wendland continues to be evoked. Thus in 2006, a five-page advertisement by the Free Republic of Wendland against the Nuclear Industry and Police Brutality was published in a local newspaper.Notice from the Free Republic of Wendland from 21 October 2006 Between June 4 and 6, 2010, on the 30th anniversary of the eviction, a memorial and protest weekend was held near Gorleben in which about 800 people participated. During this action, members of the Rural Emergency Association L√ºchow-Dannenberg erected a \\"hut sanctuary\\" in the forest in memory of the hut village of the Free Republic of Wendland.33 Day village, 33 year resistance in Gorleben as a focal point of anti-nuclear movement After the 30th anniversary of the eviction, the director Florian Fiedler, along with the Playhouse Hannover, initiated the theatre project Free Republic of Wendland -- Reactivated from 17 until 26 September 2010. About 50 students, especially from the Gesamtschule IGS Roderbruch, and 25 adults from the Ballhof Theatre in Hannover erected a hut village in Ballhof Square along the same lines of the original protest village.

In computational science, wildfire modeling is concerned with numerical simulation of wildland fires in order to understand and predict fire behavior. Wildfire modeling can ultimately aid wildland fire suppression, namely increase safety of firefighters and the public, reduce risk, and minimize damage. Wildfire modeling can also aid in protecting ecosystems, watersheds, and air quality. Objectives Wildfire modeling attempts to reproduce fire behavior, such as how quickly the fire spreads, in which direction, how much heat it generates. A key input to behavior modeling is the Fuel Model, or type of fuel, through which the fire is burning. Behavior modeling can also include whether the fire transitions from the surface (a \\"surface fire\\") to the tree crowns (a \\"crown fire\\"), as well as extreme fire behavior including rapid rates of spread, fire whirls, and tall well-developed convection columns. Fire modeling also attempts to estimate fire effects, such as the ecological and hydrological effects of the fire, fuel consumption, tree mortality, and amount and rate of smoke produced. Environmental factors Wildland fire behavior is affected by weather, fuel characteristics, and topography. Weather influences fire through wind and moisture. Wind increases the fire spread in the wind direction, higher temperature makes the fire burn faster, while higher relative humidity, and precipitation (rain or snow) may slow it down or extinguish it altogether. Weather involving fast wind changes can be particularly dangerous, since they can suddenly change the fire direction and behavior. Such weather includes cold fronts, foehn winds, thunderstorm downdrafts, sea and land breeze, and diurnal slope winds. Wildfire fuel includes grass, wood, and anything else that can burn. Small dry twigs burn faster while large logs burn slower; dry fuel ignites more easily and burns faster than wet fuel. Topography factors that influence wildfires include the orientation toward the sun, which influences the amount of energy received from the sun, and the slope (fire spreads faster uphill). Fire can accelerate in narrow canyons and it can be slowed down or stopped by barriers such as creeks and roads. These factors act in combination. Rain or snow increases the fuel moisture, high relative humidity slows the drying of the fuel, while winds can make fuel dry faster. Wind can change the fire-accelerating effect of slopes to effects such as downslope windstorms (called Santa Anas, foehn winds, East winds, depending on the geographic location). Fuel properties may vary with topography as plant density varies with elevation or aspect with respect to the sun. It has long been recognized that \\"fires create their own weather.\\" That is, the heat and moisture created by the fire feed back into the atmosphere, creating intense winds that drive the fire behavior. The heat produced by the wildfire changes the temperature of the atmosphere and creates strong updrafts, which can change the direction of surface winds. The water vapor released by the fire changes the moisture balance of the atmosphere. The water vapor can be carried away, where the latent heat stored in the vapor is released through condensation. Approaches Like all models in computational science, fire models need to strike a balance between fidelity, availability of data, and fast execution. Wildland fire models span a vast range of complexity, from simple cause and effect principles to the most physically complex presenting a difficult supercomputing challenge that cannot hope to be solved faster than real time. Forest-fire models have been developed since 1940 to the present, but a lot of chemical and thermodynamic questions related to fire behaviour are still to be resolved. Scientists and their forest fire models from 1940 till 2003 are listed in article.E. Pastor, L. Zarate, E. Planas and J. Arnaldos. Mathematical models and calculation systems for the study of wildland fire behaviour. Progress in Energy and Combustion Science, 29:139‚Äì153, 2003. Doi:10.1016/S0360-1285(03)00017-0) Models can be divided into three groups: Empirical, Semi-empirical, and Physically based. =Empirical models= Conceptual models from experience and intuition from past fires can be used to anticipate the future. Many semi-empirical fire spread equations, as in those published by the USDA Forest Service,Richard C. Rothermel. A mathematical model for predicting fire spread in wildland fires.

Based on the work by Fons's in 1946,W. L. Fons. Analysis of fire spread in light fuels. Journal of Agricultural Research, 72:93--121, 1946. and Emmons in 1963,H. W. Emmons. Fire in the forest. Fire Research Abstracts and Reviews, 5:163, 1963. the quasi-steady equilibrium spread rate calculated for a surface fire on flat ground in no-wind conditions was calibrated using data of piles of sticks burned in a flame chamber/wind tunnel to represent other wind and slope conditions for the fuel complexes tested. Two-dimensional fire growth models such as FARSITEMark A. Finney. FARSITE: Fire area simulator-model development and evaluation. Res. Pap. RMRS-RP-4, Ogden, UT: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station. 47 p., http://www.farsite.org, 1998. and Prometheus, the Canadian wildland fire growth model designed to work in Canadian fuel complexes, have been developed that apply such semi-empirical relationships and others regarding ground-to- crown transitions to calculate fire spread and other parameters along the surface. Certain assumptions must be made in models such as FARSITE and Prometheus to shape the fire growth. For example, Prometheus and FARSITE use the Huygens principle of wave propagation. A set of equations that can be used to propagate (shape and direction) a fire front using an elliptical shape was developed by Richards in 1990.G.D. Richards, ‚ÄúAn Elliptical Growth Model of Forest Fire Fronts and Its Numerical Solution‚Äù, Int. J. Numer. Meth. Eng.,. 30:1163-1179, 1990. Although more sophisticated applications use a three- dimensional numerical weather prediction system to provide inputs such as wind velocity to one of the fire growth models listed above, the input was passive and the feedback of the fire upon the atmospheric wind and humidity are not accounted for. =Physically based models and coupling with the atmosphere= A simplified physically based two-dimensional fire spread models based upon conservation laws that use radiation as the dominant heat transfer mechanism and convection, which represents the effect of wind and slope, lead to reaction‚Äìdiffusion systems of partial differential equations.M.

The cost of added physical complexity is a corresponding increase in computational cost, so much so that a full three-dimensional explicit treatment of combustion in wildland fuels by direct numerical simulation (DNS) at scales relevant for atmospheric modeling does not exist, is beyond current supercomputers, and does not currently make sense to do because of the limited skill of weather models at spatial resolution under 1 km. Consequently, even these more complex models parameterize the fire in some way, for example, papers by ClarkT. L. Clark, M. A. Jenkins, J. Coen, and David Packham. A coupled atmospheric-fire model: Convective Froude number and dynamic fingering. International Journal of Wildland Fire, 6:177--190, 1996.Terry L. Clark, Marry Ann Jenkins, Janice Coen, and David Packham. A coupled atmospheric-fire model: Convective feedback on fire line dynamics. J. Appl. Meteor, 35:875--901, 1996. use equations developed by Rothermel for the USDA forest service to calculate local fire spread rates using fire-modified local winds. And, although FIRETEC and WFDS carry prognostic conservation equations for the reacting fuel and oxygen concentrations, the computational grid cannot be fine enough to resolve the reaction rate-limiting mixing of fuel and oxygen, so approximations must be made concerning the subgrid-scale temperature distribution or the combustion reaction rates themselves. These models also are too small-scale to interact with a weather model, so the fluid motions use a computational fluid dynamics model confined in a box much smaller than the typical wildfire. Attempts to create the most complete theoretical model were made by Albini F.A. in USA and Grishin A.M.A.M. Grishin. Mathematical models of forest fires and New Methods of Fighting Them. Publishing House of the Tomsk University, Tomsk, Russia, 1997. (edited by F.A. Albini) in Russia. Grishin's work is based on the fundamental laws of physics, conservation and theoretical justifications are provided. The simplified two- dimensional model of running crown forest fire was developed in Belarusian State University by Barovik D.V.Barovik, D.; Taranchuk, V. 2010. Mathematical modelling of running crown forest fires. Mathematical Modelling and Analysis 15(2):161-174 https://doi.org/10.3846/1392-6292.2010.15.161-174 fulltext and Taranchuk V.B. Data assimilation Data assimilation periodically adjusts the model state to incorporate new data using statistical methods. Because fire is highly nonlinear and irreversible, data assimilation for fire models poses special challenges, and standard methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) do not work well. Statistical variability of corrections and especially large corrections may result in nonphysical states, which tend to be preceded or accompanied by large spatial gradients. In order to ease this problem, the regularized EnKFCraig J. Johns and Jan Mandel. A two-stage ensemble Kalman filter for smooth data assimilation.

Proceedings of Conference on New Developments of Statistical Analysis in Wildlife, Fisheries, and Ecological Research, Oct 13-16, 2004, Columbia, MI. fulltext preprint penalizes large changes of spatial gradients in the Bayesian update in EnKF. The regularization technique has a stabilizing effect on the simulations in the ensemble but it does not improve much the ability of the EnKF to track the data: The posterior ensemble is made out of linear combinations of the prior ensemble, and if a reasonably close location and shape of the fire cannot be found between the linear combinations, the data assimilation is simply out of luck, and the ensemble cannot approach the data. From that point on, the ensemble evolves essentially without regard to the data. This is called filter divergence. So, there is clearly a need to adjust the simulation state by a position change rather than an additive correction only. The morphing EnKFJonathan D. Beezley and Jan Mandel. Morphing ensemble Kalman filters. Tellus, 60A:131--140, 2008 fulltext preprint combines the ideas of data assimilation with image registration and morphing to provide both additive and position correction in a natural manner, and can be used to change a model state reliably in response to data. Limitations and practical use The limitations on fire modeling are not entirely computational. At this level, the models encounter limits in knowledge about the composition of pyrolysis products and reaction pathways, in addition to gaps in basic understanding about some aspects of fire behavior such as fire spread in live fuels and surface-to-crown fire transition. Thus, while more complex models have value in studying fire behavior and testing fire spread in a range of scenarios, from the application point of view, FARSITE and Palm-based applications of BEHAVE have shown great utility as practical in-the-field tools because of their ability to provide estimates of fire behavior in real time. While the coupled fire-atmosphere models have the ability to incorporate the ability of the fire to affect its own local weather, and model many aspects of the explosive, unsteady nature of fires that cannot be incorporated in current tools, it remains a challenge to apply these more complex models in a faster- than-real-time operational environment. Also, although they have reached a certain degree of realism when simulating specific natural fires, they must yet address issues such as identifying what specific, relevant operational information they could provide beyond current tools, how the simulation time could fit the operational time frame for decisions (therefore, the simulation must run substantially faster than real time), what temporal and spatial resolution must be used by the model, and how they estimate the inherent uncertainty in numerical weather prediction in their forecast. These operational constraints must be used to steer model development.

History Prisoners who have proven responsible have access to various places of employment and education programs, the right to take vacations from prison, as well as rehabilitative treatment through various methods including therapy animals. Prisoners who have a history of problematic behavior are held under tighter security and are not permitted to take vacations. There is a special wing for religious inmates called the Torani wing, also known as \\"Beis Medrash Maasiyahu\\", where inmates spend most of the day praying and studying Torah and other sacred Jewish texts in two seminaries and do not have access to television and newspapers. The whole prison complex is located in the city of Ramla in the Central District of Israel. In 2002, inmates declared a hunger strike to protest what they viewed as improper medical and legal treatment. In 2004, public workers from the nearby town of Lod, who had not been paid in months, chained themselves to the gates of the prison in a public protest, demanding to be arrested so they could be fed the free prison food. In 2005, a wing of the prison was converted to house those detained while protesting Sharon's plan to withdraw from 21 settlements in Gaza and another 4 in the West Bank. The new wing can house 900 detainees.

It combines antipyrine, a NSAID, and benzocaine, a numbing agent in order to treat ear pain, alongside hydroxyquinoline sulfate, an antiseptic and preservative. It is sold as Auralgan, Aurodex, Auroto, among other brands, and is abbreviated as A/B otic drops.  Medical uses  A/B otic drops is indicated for ear pain caused by otitis media. It is used every 2‚Äì3 hours as needed for pain. A/B otic drops is also indicated for the removal of excessive or impacted cerumen. To clear cerumen, it is used 3 times a day for 2‚Äì3 days.  Ingredients  Each 1 ml of A/B otic drops contains: * Antipyrine 54 mg * Benzocaine 14 mg * Glycerin and Hydroxyquinoline Sulfate USP  Clinical pharmacology  A/B otic drops are effective because antipyrine reduces pain and inflammation and benzocaine numbs the ear.  Reformulation  In 2008, Auralgan was reformulated to include acetic acid and U-polycosanol 410, in addition to antipyrine and benzocaine. Due to this reformulation, pharmacies could no longer substitute the generic antipyrine/benzocaine drops for a prescription written as \\"Auralgan\\". The price for the new formulation was roughly $150.00 compared to the generic price of $2.00.  United states ban on manufacture  In 2015, in accordance with their initiative to remove unapproved prescription drugs from the market, the FDA mandated that companies stop manufacturing this drug or be subject to criminal charges. The FDA has not evaluated this drug for safety, effectiveness or quality and has concerns about inappropriate dosing and risk of contamination during the manufacturing process.

The school is the official Liverpool F.C. Academy Education Centre in Merseyside for under-18 players to be educated. Notable former pupils from the academy include Raheem Sterling and Trent Alexander- Arnold. The school has recently partnered with FA FE to strengthen post-16 education for the players. FE FA is owned and run by Robbie Fowler, former Liverpool and England footballer.  History  On 28 and 30 March 2017 the NASUWT teachers union began 14 days of discontinuous strike action. NASUWT representatives said the strike action was due to \\"unacceptable management practices by the employer toward teachers taking part in an ongoing national dispute over excessive workload\\". They added that management had \\"failed to attend meetings\\" to discuss the \\"intimidation being experienced by staff taking part in action short of strike action at the school\\". The school converted to an Academy under Rainhill Learning Village in March 2017. More recently, the school has become part of the Stephenson Trust. It is the lead school in this academy trust. It is an oversubscribed high school. Every year the school received in excess of 600 applications for entry into Year 7. The school has responded to its significant popularity by increasing its pupil admission number, from September 2017, from 240 entry into Year 7 to 300. By September 2021, there will be 1,500 11‚Äì16 year olds plus the Sixth Form students on the site. In addition to Liverpool FC, it has formal partnerships with Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, Liverpool John Moores University and University of Leeds. There is a strong academic curriculum that reflects the high number of high performing students at the school. Students can choose from over 20 GCSEs.

It is based on standards and agreements developed by the German Banking Industry Committee. German Girocards are usually co- branded with Mastercard's Maestro/Cirrus or Visa's V Pay logo, allowing cardholders to use them in other European countries.Postbank: V PAY, Retrieved August 22, 2010.Sparkasse debit card leaflet , Retrieved August 22, 2010.VR Bank debit cards picture gallery , Retrieved August 22, 2010.ING-DiBa: Paying with your card , Retrieved August 22, 2010.Commerzbank Banking Portal , Retrieved August 22, 2010. As another co-badging option, combined Girocard/JCB cards were introduced in 2016.JCB: PayCenter GmbH stellt die erste JCB- girocard Co-badged Karte in Deutschland vor, German, Retrieved August 11, 2016.  History  Originally, German banks formed an interbank network connecting virtually all German ATMs. The network used Eurocheque guarantee cards as ATM cards and did not have a name or trademark of its own. In 1991, the electronic cash debit card service was introduced using the same cards, replacing the Geldkarte ATM and POS scheme on the territory of East Germany.A predecessor of electronic cash, the East German Geldkarte scheme is not to be confused with GeldKarte/girogo, a distinct stored value application introduced in the late 1990s: p. 12. The cards used for all three payment methods were simply known as Eurocheque card (German Eurocheque-Karte). When the Eurocheque system was disbanded at the end of 2001, the cards could no longer use the Eurocheque brand. However, German banks continued to use the EC logo, which was simply re-interpreted as \\"electronic cash\\". Consequently, the cards were colloquially known as EC card (German EC-Karte). However, the ATM network still did not have a trade name and was generically called \\"Deutsches Geldautomaten-System\\". In 2007, the German Banking Industry Committee introduced \\"Girocard\\" as a common name for electronic cash and the German ATM network. Girocard purports to be SEPA-compliant, even though cards are only issued and accepted within Germany.  Services  = POS = The Girocard network is used for point-of-sale payments within Germany. Two principal processing methods can be used: chip-and-pin guaranteed Girocard payment and chip-and-signature non-guaranteed Electronic Direct Debit (ELV, Elektronisches Lastschriftverfahren). About 770,000 places in Germany accepted Girocard payments in summer 2016 (approximately one location per 106 inhabitants). The slow pace of the expansion of the Girocard acceptance network has attracted criticism from authors who have pointed out that in the UK, the once-dominant Switch/Maestro debit cards were accepted at 571,268 locations in 2001 (one location per 103 inhabitants) and at over 900,000 places in 2005 ‚Äì ‚Äúfrom high street shops to pubs, opticians, websites, cinemas ‚Äì even local councils‚Äù. p. 10. A common misconception is that Girocard can be used for card-not-present payments. Girocards are generally not equipped for e-commerce and any attempt to use the internal 19-digit card number, starting with 672 or 482, through Maestro or V Pay will fail. SEPA Direct Debit transactions are occasionally mislabeled as EC or Girocard e-commerce transactions. = ATM network = The German ATM network connects virtually all German ATMs. However, German banks charge high out-of-network ATM usage fees (up to ‚Ç¨10) from customers using Girocards from unaffiliated banks. (As surcharges for cash withdrawals within the Visa or Mastercard networks are rather uncommon, certain specialty banks, mostly online banks and ethnic banks, have started to issue Visa Debit and Debit Mastercard cards to their German customers for free cash withdrawals. p. 15.) There are several cooperations reducing or waiving these fees: * EUFISERV is a European compact which includes the Sparkasse saving banks in Germany as to waive the fees for customers of other local branches. * Bankcard- Servicenetz is a cooperation of most co-operative banks to waive or reduce the fees for other co-operative banks. * Cash Group is a cooperation of major private banks, which mutually waive the fees. * CashPool is a cooperation of smaller private banks (including many virtual banks), which mutually waive the fees. Some banks participate in more than one cooperation and therefore offer free cash withdrawals at more than 85% of all German ATMs. In addition, some large chain stores such as REWE, PENNY Markt, toom Baumarkt and Netto Marken- Discount offer cashback at the till.

With its stately manor house and prime location in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley, Court Manor has long been regarded as \\"one of the finest estates in the Valley of Virginia.\\"Harrison, J. Houston. Settlers by the Long Grey Trail: Some Pioneers to Old Augusta County, Virginia. Harrisonburg, Virginia: C.J. Carrier Co., 1983. The estate is situated on U.S. Route 11, which follows the route of the historic Great Wagon Road, a colonial thoroughfare connecting Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Savannah, Georgia.Terrell, Isaac Long. Old Houses in Rockingham County, 1750-1850. 3rd edition. McClure Press. (1983). The estate's landholdings include some of land, extending from the base of the Massanutten Mountain Ridge to about one- half mile () west of U.S. Route 11. The manor house (circa 1800), with its impressive Greek Revival portico, can be easily seen from the tree-lined stretch of U.S. Route 11 that passes through the heart of the estate. Early Estate History =Colonial Period= Sometime prior to the final surveying of the Fairfax Line in 1746, Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, granted a tract of land on the Great Wagon Road near Smith Creek to a Samuel Newman, who in turn sold the land in 1754 to Thomas Moore, Sr., (1727‚Äì1797). The first permanent dwelling to be built on the estate was the house of Thomas Moore, Sr., which was located on a knoll overlooking Smith Creek. Seeking to expand the size of his landholdings, Moore petitioned the Crown for a land grant of some , which was granted by King George III eleven years later in 1765.Hadsell, Jerome B. Life and Times of Willis Sharpe Kilmer. Binghamton Press, 1940. For the next century and a half, the estate was to remain in the hands of Moore family.\\"Mooreland Hall.\\" Virginia Conservation Commission: Division of History, George W. Fetzer, researcher. Works Progress Administration of Virginia: Historical Inventory. 1936. =American Revolution and later 18th century= In the years leading up to the American Revolution, Moore and his sons continued to expand and improve the estate. Moore's oldest son and future heir, Captain Reuben Moore, Sr., left the estate at the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War to serve as an officer in the Rockingham militia under Colonel Benjamin Harrison. By the war's end in 1784, some 17 members of the Moore family were residing on the estate, both in the original house built by Thomas Moore, Sr., and in a second house built by his third son, Thomas Moore, Jr.Heads of Families at the First Census of the United States Taken in the Year 1790, Virginia. (Records of the State Enumerations: 1782 to 1785) Washington: Government Printing Office, 1908. Reprinted: 1993 by American Genealogical Lending Library. Transcribed from microfiche. After the war, Captain Moore returned to the plantation and was elected a Commissioner of Rockingham County in 1789. It was Captain Moore who selected a wide, gently rolling tract of land near the Great Wagon Road on which to build a small log house for his family. A quarter-century later, Captain Moore's son, Reuben Moore, Jr., would build Court Manor on the very spot where his father's log cabin once stood. Design and construction Reuben Moore, Jr., likely began construction of Court Manor (then known as Mooreland Hall) during the last years of the eighteenth century, following his grandfather's death in 1797.Terrell asserts that construction started prior to the beginning of the nineteenth century, and based on the extant historical records, construction was completed sometime between 1800 and 1812, the year that Reuben Moore, Jr., was married. Mooreland Hall would have been a rather conventional exercise in the late colonial style if it were not for the incorporation of the impressive Greek Revival portico into the design. Supported by four massive columns of the Doric order and surmounted by a simple triangular pediment decorated with a single semi-circular window, the scale of the portico dominates the main facade of the house. The large, two- level structure was constructed using bricks fired on site by the plantation's slaves. The house contained twelve spacious rooms, each with a fireplace and with large windows, affording panoramic views of the rolling countryside with the Massanutten Mountain Ridge rising in the distance. The grandeur of the mansion and its handsomely landscaped grounds served to match the impressive scale of the estate, which at 1,700 acres was unusually large by Valley standards. The wide, spacious lawn, dotted with large trees, slopes gently towards a spring-fed brook that arises on the grounds of the estate less than a mile away and meanders gently towards Smith Creek, which also runs through the estate. Smith Creek was used to power the plantation's mill, which produced flour and other products that were transported up and down the Great Wagon Road. The estate remained in the Moore family until 1879, when Oscar Fitz Allen Moore, grandson of Reuben Moore, Jr., sold the estate to William C. & George H. Harrison. Twentieth Century While the house was originally known as Mooreland Hall, by the early 20th century the estate came to be known as Court Manor.Virginia: A Guide to the Old Dominion. U.S. History Publishers. (1952). Over the years the original structure was expanded with various additions including a large enclosed sun porch on the southwest side of the building and an extended suite of guest rooms on the north side of the house. However, after its 1987 restoration, the front, central portion of the manor house appears today as it did when it was constructed around 1800. In 1925, Court Manor was purchased by Willis Sharpe Kilmer, a New York entrepreneur, newspaperman, and horse breeder best known for marketing his uncle's popular medicinal tonic \\"Dr. Kilmer's cure-all remedy Swamp Root\\".Sutcliffe, Andrea. Touring the Shenandoah Valley Backroads. Washington: John F. Blair Publishing, 1999. The period of Kilmer's ownership of the estate saw dramatic development of the property, establishing it as one of the country's most preeminent horse studs. Exterminator, the winner of the 1918 Kentucky Derby, resided on the estate after his racing career, and Reigh Count, the winner of the 1928 Kentucky Derby, was bred and born on the estate.Graves, James R. and Crim, John D. Around New Market. Arcadia Publishing. (2007). After Kilmer had acquired Court Manor in 1923, he had some 10,000 silver maple trees planted along the roads of the estate in memory of those lost in World War I. Today these trees are still extant and can be seen lining both sides of U.S. Route 11 as it passes through the estate.Wayland, John W. Historic Homes of Northern Virginia. Staunton, Virginia: The McClure Company, 1937. Following Kilmer's death, Court Manor fell into a state of disrepair and slow deterioration. During the back-to-the-land movement of the 1960s and 1970s, the estate was home to a commune, and by the early 1980s, the estate's landholdings had dwindled to some , the manor house was virtually uninhabitable, and the entire estate was in a state of ruin. In 1985, Court Manor was acquired by North Carolina textile magnate Nicholas Wehrmann, Sr., who initiated a wide-scale renovation of the manor house and estate grounds. The original section of the house and its Greek Revival portico were intact enough to be preserved in whole, but the later additions, which used inferior construction methods, had sustained far too much structural damage to be salvaged. The renovation restored the structure to its original condition and added two additional wings to the house. Also during this period the grounds of the estate were revitalized for agricultural purposes. Pastures underwent extensive renovation, historical barns were preserved, and new construction of barns, corrals, feeding systems, and miles of high tensile fence was completed. Since 1985, acquisitions by Wehrmann have restored nearly of land to the estate, bringing the total landholdings to some .\\"Court Manor\\". Field Tours of the 83rd National Block and Bridle Convention. Washington, DC. (2003). The estate was home to Wehrmann's herd of purebred Aberdeen Angus cattle, operated by the firm Wehrmann Angus.

Life Pusey stood for election in Rye at a by-election in 1830 and was originally declared elected, but following an election petition he was unseated by an order of the House of Commons on 17 May 1830. He did not contest Rye at the 1830 general election, when he was elected as a Member for Chippenham. He did not contest Chippenham at the 1831 election, and stood instead in Rye. After riots in the town hall, Pusey agreed to withdraw from the election in return for a guarantee from General De Lacy Evans to protect the peace of the town; Evans won the seat. Pusey was then returned at an uncontested by-election in July 1831 for the borough of Cashel in Ireland, and held that seat until the 1832 general election, when he stood unsuccessfully in Berkshire.

He played in the Eredivisie and Eerste Divisie for Volendam, Willem II, Fortuna Sittard and Almere City, and in the American Premier Development League for the Cincinnati Dutch Lions. Mostly known for his eight-year spell with FC Volendam, in which he won the Dutch Eerste Divisie and secured promotion to the Eredivisie in the 2007‚Äì08 season, van Zaanen retired from professional football in 2014 and played at amateur level until 2017. He made 129 league appearances for Volendam, in which he scored 36 goals. After retirement, he started working as a videographer. Career Before moving to FC Volendam in 2003, van Zaanen played for the amateur clubs HBOK and DWV in Amsterdam. He made his professional debut on 9 May 2003 in a second-tier Eerste Divisie match against Stormvogels Telstar. In the 2007‚Äì08 season, he scored twelve goals in 34 appearances. Van Zaanen thus played a key role in the promotion of FC Volendam to the Eredivisie for the 2008‚Äì09 season. The club's stay at the highest level was, however, limited to one season as they suffered direct relegation after a year. Van Zaanen signed a two-year contract with Willem II in June 2010 with an option for another season. On 7 August 2010, he made his debut for the club against Heracles Almelo. In the winter break of the 2011‚Äì12 season, van Zaanen moved to Fortuna Sittard on loan. After completing his loan deal in June 2012, he signed a one- year contract with Almere City. He left the club as his contract expired. Van Zaanen's professional career came to an end in 2014, after having been a free agent for almost a year after leaving Almere City. He went to play for another year as an amateur in the United States with the Cincinnati Dutch Lions. and then played at amateur level for Kozakken Boys and Achilles Veen before retiring permanently in 2017.

Although he was known mainly for his murals and his travel literature, his artwork also regularly appeared in Scribner's Magazine. His 1916 work Our Hispanic Southwest is famous for including the first written appearance of the ethnic slur \\"spic\\" (although, in fact, it had previously appeared with a different spelling and pronunciation). Biography Born on October 15, 1869, in San Francisco, California, Peixotto was one of five children in a Sephardic Jewish family: his sister was Jessica Blanche Peixotto. He studied art at the Mark Hopkins Institute of Art with Emil Carlsen, who encouraged him to go to Paris. Taking his advice, Peixotto went to France in 1888 and studied at the Acad√©mie Julian under the tutelage of Jean-Joseph Benjamin-Constant, Henri Lucien Doucet and Jules Joseph Lefebvre. While in France, he visited the colony of the American Impressionists and befriended Theodore Robinson. He spent a total of six years in France, returning to San Francisco in 1894. The following year, he moved to New York City, and joined the staff of Scribner's Magazine. In 1897, he married the painter Mary Glascock Hutchinson in New Orleans. Two years later the couple returned to France on a sketching trip for Scribner's and ended up staying for six years based in Fontainebleau, outside Paris. During this period, Peixotto illustrated Theodore Roosevelt's Life of Oliver Cromwell (1904). Although he frequently returned to the United States to work, the house in Fontainebleau served as his primary residence for the remainder of his life. Peixotto's illustration of John Singer Sargent's mural \\"Triumph of Religion\\", Boston Public Library, 1896. In the spring and summer of 1907 he sketched at the art colonies in Berkeley, California and in Carmel- by-the-Sea, California, where he exhibited his work at the Annual of the local Arts & Crafts Club. That year he also had a conspicuous presence in the community of San Francisco artists, associating with Charles Dickman at the Bohemian Club Grove and with Will Sparks and Maynard Dixon at the Sequoia Club. That fall he was teaching at the Art Institute of Chicago, where Thomas Hart Benton was his student. After having been elected to the National Academy of Design in 1909, Peixotto's first large commissioned mural was Le Morte d'Arthur for a private library for railroader Henry A. Everett (not, as widely repeated, at the Cleveland Public Library) in 1911. Subsequently, the majority of his work was in mural form, most of it for private individuals. During World War I, Peixotto served as a captain in the United States Army Corps of Engineers, director of the Section of Painting, and one of eight official artists attached to the American Expeditionary Force, whose job was to create a visual record of events. After the war, he remained in France as director of the United States Army's art-training center, which merged into the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in 1923. Peixotto remained as the chair of the school's American Committee, while simultaneously serving as the director of the mural department of the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design in New York, a position he held from 1919 through 1926, when he left to focus on his own work. In June 1921 he was made a Chevalier in the L√©gion d'honneur, for war work and the promotion of friendship between France and the United States. However, he still served on a number of art organizations. He was the president of the National Society of Mural Painters from 1929 to 1935, and president of School Art League of New York from 1936 to 1940. From 1935 to 1940 he served on the Art Commission of New York City and was director of murals for the 1939 New York World's Fair. Peixotto died on December 6, 1940.
