It has grown since its inception to do a number of tasks, all concerned with the health of lakes and rivers in Florida. There are more than 5,400 lakes in Florida and a number of rivers. Florida Lakewatch is basically a volunteer water-monitoring program. This project is headquartered at Gainesville, Florida, within the campus of the University of Florida. Florida Lakewatch has in its history obtained funding from a number of sources, but currently is mostly funded by the state of Florida.

The Department of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences of the University of Florida provides faculty, staff and laboratory support to more than 1,800 volunteers. Reliable water chemistry data has been collected from more than 1,000 lakes from at least fifty counties. Florida Lakewatch works directly with citizens who live on or use lakes, rivers or waterways and are willing to participate in a long-term monitoring effort. These volunteers must have access to a boat, since much of the data collection must be done away from lake shores.

It was designed by Vickers, and produced by Vickers, Miesse and Familleheureux and outfitted with FRC Herstal weaponry. The earlier T-13s were based on imported Vickers tracked vehicles that were outfitted with armament and armor in Belgium by the Miesse company; later versions, from the B3 version on, were fully license-produced in Belgium by the Familleheureux factory. Total production numbers are unclear and have been underestimated for political reasons, both before and after World War II, but are generally estimated at 300 vehicles, although not all were available or fully outfitted on 10 May 1940, the start of the Battle of Belgium. Nazi Germany used the vehicles after the occupation of Belgium, but to what extent remains unclear. History In general - keeping a close watch on German political and military developments - the need for armored tracked vehicles or tanks was widely accepted by the Belgian military establishment. The political view on the matter however was slightly more complex: the Belgian government tried frantically, keeping in mind the total destruction of the small country in the First World War, to keep Belgium neutral from 1936 on and therefore out of the upcoming European conflict.Charles Cheney Hyde, 'Belgium and Neutrality', The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 31, No. 1. (January 1937), p. 82 Politicians from the right wing political parties wished Belgium would abstain from buying offensive weapons like tanks and bombers, so as not to provoke Germany into starting a new war; politicians from left wing parties rejected heavy arms on an ideological basis. From this point of view the T-13 tank destroyer could be described as the result of Belgium's neutrality doctrine: the vehicle had to be light, and therefore lightly armored, and was built without a fully enclosed fighting compartment, much like the German Panzerj√§ger designs, thus resulting in a tank destroyer class vehicle, rather than a true tank. Also, as with the T-15 Light tank units, the psychological words tank or armored/mechanized unit were never to be used in official unit designations, with the words armored/tracked motorcar and the historical cavalry being favored. Vickers Carden Loyd 1934 artillery tractor Since the Belgian armed forces realized the need for further mechanization of the army in the 1930s, a number of foreign platforms were looked at. In 1934, the Belgian Army signed a contract for 21 or 23 Vickers Carden Loyd 1934 artillery tractors with the British firm Vickers. These were meant as artillery tractors for the Chasseurs Ardennais mountain troops, to tow the recently acquired Bofors 75 mm Model 1934 mountain gun. Impressed with the vehicle's performance on both hilly and flat terrain, the Belgian Armed Forces decided to take the concept a little further and experimentally outfitted the tractor with the F.R.C. built 47 mm anti-tank gun, much along the lines of the earlier but ultimately unsuccessful SA F.R.C. 47mm experiment. Not much is known about the basic model Vickers 1934 artillery tractor, apart from the fact that the Belgian Army seems to have been the sole user of the type. In its basic configuration, the Vickers 1934 artillery tractor was unarmored and could generally be described as an open, tracked light truck. It was outfitted with a 51 hp 5 cylinder Meadows gasoline engine with an internal volume of 3300 cc, and had an empty weight of 2 tons. Apart from the Bofors 75 mm equipped Chasseurs Ardennais, no other Belgian armed units were outfitted with the type, the Belgian armed forces instead preferring the smaller and far less expensive Vickers/Familleureux utility tractor as their main tracked transporter later on. However, given its successful use with the Chasseurs Ardennais mountain troops, the Belgian Armed Forces decided to order another 32 vehicles, which became the basis for the T-13 B1. T-13 B1/B2 design Pleased with the performance of the Vickers 1934 artillery truck, the Belgian Army started to equip the newly ordered 32 vehicles with the FRC Herstal built 47 mm Model 1931 anti-tank gun. Since this was a fairly heavy piece of equipment, and because of the general lay-out of the Vickers artillery tractor, with its center of gravity being well halfway the vehicle, the decision was taken to simply install the gun and its turret backwards on the vehicle, so as to keep enough space for crew and ammunition.See picture of T-13 B1 for visual reference The general lay out of the vehicle mimicked that of the Vickers vehicle it was based on. The suspension was made out of Horstmann suspensions resting on bogies with two rubber-lined wheel sets per bogie. This design, exclusively used on lightweight vehicles, was also used on the Light Tank Mk VI of the Royal army and was invented by Sidney Horstmann. Apart from being relatively easy to build, compact and lightweight, it had the advantage of having a long travel, and of being easy to replace when damaged in the field.Horstmann history The drive sprocket was in the front, but there were no idlers or return rollers. Motor power came in the form of a Meadows 5 cylinder gasoline engine, producing 51 hp, coupled with a four speed preselector gearbox.Chamberlain, Peter; Ellis, Chris (2001). British and American Tanks of World War Two: The complete illustrated history of British, American, and Commonwealth tanks 1933‚Äì1945. Cassell & Company. Steering was a combination of declutching the drive to one track and braking to increase the turn. The traverse of the turret was man powered by the three man crew. The T-13s were not equipped with a radio. Armor protection was limited, but still better than that of the under armored T-15 light tank. Frontal armor was 12 mm of hardened steel, both on the frontal bulkhead and on the turret. Side armor on the vehicle basis and turret was restricted to 6 mm of steel, to minimize the weight, costs and political impact of the vehicle. This meant that the T-13 crew was only fully protected against indirect blast and splinter damage, adequately protected against small arms fire from the frontal aspect but not from the sides, and most importantly was not protected at all against most light anti-tank rounds, such as the .50 BMG, the Boys anti-tank rifle .55 Boys or the German 13.2 mm TuF. Also, the side armor shields had to be folded down to permit the full 360¬∞ traverse of the turret, further exposing the crew to enemy rifle fire. If the (lightly) armored side shields were left upwards, traverse of the turret was limited to 120¬∞ in the frontal aspect. Armament was fairly heavy for this lightweight vehicle, giving the T-13 tank destroyer a very nasty bite. Main armament was the 47 mm Model 1931 anti-tank gun, which fired 1.52 kg armor- piercing shells and could penetrate 47 mm of armor plating from a distance of 300 m, for its time an impressive performance. The maximum firing range of the gun was 2000 m, and, as both armor-piercing and high-explosive rounds were available, the gun had a useful anti-infantry capability as well. The secondary armament consisted of a single turret-mounted light FN built M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, in essence a Belgian license-built Browning BAR machine gun in a special 7.65x53mm \\"Belgian Mauser calibre\\" instead of the American .30. The machine gun could fire 500‚Äì650 rounds per minute.Bishop, Chris: The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II, p. 239. Sterling Publishing, 2000 Production After the prototype T-13 B1 passed all the tests of the Belgian Army, in 1935 production on the tank destroyer was authorized to proceed: the Miesse company near Buizingen (close to Brussels) delivered 32 T-13 B1s, all based on imported British built Vickers 1934 artillery tractors. The T-13 B2 model was a further development of the B1, but differs only slightly from the B1 model: most importantly the turret was redesigned to give the vehicle a somewhat lower frontal silhouette. All 21 (23 according to some sources) T-13 B2s were apparently converted from the earlier ordered Vickers artillery tractors for the Chasseurs Ardennais mountain troops, tracked transport of the M34 75mm Bofors mountain gun now passed on to the smaller but more economical Vickers/Familleureux utility tractor. T-13 B2 assembly ended by 1937. T-13 B3 design Two German soldiers looking at a captured T13 B3 Although the Belgian armed forces were generally very pleased with the capabilities of the existing T-13 B1 and B2s, there were obvious issues with both models of the tank destroyer. Since the original Vickers artillery tractor was not designed for the tank destroyer mission, it was faced with a common vehicle design problem called 'weight creep', which in essence is the gradual accumulation of weight every time a new feature or capability is added to the design. This led to the first model T-13s being underpowered, somewhat unstable as a gunnery platform, and prone to mechanical malfunctions because of overloading and wear and tear. Full weight was 4,5 tons for a 51 hp gasoline engine. Much more important however was the vulnerability of the three man crew. Last but not least, importing fully assembled vehicles was a technically interesting shortcut but too expensive a solution to field a tank destroyer in adequate numbers, especially with the Belgian economy performing rather poorly because of the worldwide great depression and the resulting drop in foreign demand for industrial products. The design needed rethinking. A Vickers-Carden-Loyd Light Tank Mk. II B So in 1936 a new vehicle was imported from the traditional supplier, the Vickers company - Belgian experiences with ordering from competing foreign companies such as the Renault company had been very disappointing (see AMC 35). This was the Vickers-Carden-Loyd Light Dragon Mk. IIB (see also Light tanks of the United Kingdom) in the export version, equipped with an 88 hp Meadows 6 cylinder gasoline engine and a \\"crash\\" type gearbox. The general design of the vehicle was almost identical to the T-15 Light tank already in service with the Belgian armed forces, also designed and produced by the Vickers company. The suspension was made out of Horstmann suspensions resting on bogies with two rubber-lined wheel sets per bogie. The drive sprocket was in the front, the idlers were placed in the rear, with three return rollers. Steering was again a combination of declutching the drive to one track and braking to increase the turn. The bigger track area, the inclusion of return rollers and the bigger and stronger engine convinced the Belgian armed forces that this platform would be superior in the tank destroyer role. Also, since the Familleheureux factory, a vehicle and tractor company, was already producing the license built Vickers utility tractor, the decision was taken to buy a license for production at this company instead of directly acquiring all vehicles from the UK. This would allow for a larger and more economical production run compared to the T-13 B1/B2 version. The definitive T-13 B3 was structurally very different from the earlier B1 and B2 versions, with the B3 suffix obviously chosen to play down the fact that a new tank destroyer was being produced rather than a variant of the older systems. This was again, as explained earlier, both for domestic economical and political reasons as well as to not provoke Germany into a new war. The chassis of the T-13 B3 was bigger, with, apart from the redesigned turret, a box-on-box like appearance. The gun was no longer pointed rearwards as in the first two versions. Armor was only slightly upgraded to 13 mm armored steel on the frontal surfaces and 7 mm steel on the sides, still insufficient to cope with anything but small arms fire and blast and shrapnel damage. However, the chassis was big enough to accommodate the four man crew without the need for the side armor panels, which also allowed the gun to traverse 360¬∞ without lowering the (still very low) level of armor protection for the crew in the process of gun laying. The rear remained open, since the vehicle was still meant to be a light tank destroyer. The most important and obvious difference was the bigger and more powerful engine, which allowed for greatly reduced wear and tear and a rather more stable gun laying platform, and above all for better manoeuvrability in the field. Top speed for the T-13 B3 was, because of operational reasons, kept about the same as for the B1-B2 versions: 41 km per hour as opposed to 40 km per hour. The armament, apart from lay out and sighting systems, was left untouched, although more ammunition could be carried. Range was increased: from 240 km for the B1-B2 versions to 400 km for the B3 version. Total weight became 5.08 tons. Production Given the need for the Familleheureux company to set up production after acquiring a Vickers licence in 1936, delivery of the first production T 13 B3s did not commence until 1938. After the second world war broke out in September 1939, production was stepped up so as to equip as many army units as possible with the new tank destroyer. Since acquiring its first T-13 B3s, the Belgian army was finally satisfied with the resultant tank destroyer and kept on ordering. Production of the B3 ended at the start of the Battle of Belgium, after a total of 250 to 255 units were produced by the Familleheureux factory. Together with the earlier B1 and B2 'production', this made, in theory, for a total of 303 to 311 T-13 vehicles. However, a few dozen of these T-13s were still at the factory in the process of being outfitted when war broke out. About two dozen others were on their way to being delivered to new units, but since there was no more time for driver, gunner or maintenance crew training they ended up being used as reserve vehicles for units already equipped with the T-13 or as spare part hulks. In total, it seems that only about 220 T-13 B1/B2/B3s were actually fielded with operational units. Still, this made the T-13 the most numerous armored tracked vehicle in the Belgian armed forces inventory. Deployment and operational history Field exercise with the T-13 B3 A total of 16-18 T-13 companies with 12 vehicles each were fielded, together with a number of single vehicles and squads. These T-13 companies were mostly added to some of the existing infantry divisions: the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th and 18th infantry division all had a single T-13 company on 10 May 1940. Only the 'Chasseurs Ardennais' 1st mountain division and the two cavalry divisions had 2 or 3 companies each. Together with the 42 fielded T-15s light tanks both Belgian cavalry divisions had about 50 armored tracked vehicles each, with the infantry mostly transported on motorcycles, and heavy weapons on trucks and a number of lightly armored but wheeled vehicles. Operationally, the Belgian armed forces, apart from the cavalry units, followed the rather ineffective World War One \\"penny packet\\" doctrine, also used in the French army at the time. Instead of using the armored units independently to profit maximally from their speed and mobility, the units were diluted and used to \\"stiffen\\" the infantry units: this led to an adaptation of a rather inflexible and linear way of defense, greatly reducing their speed, mobility and overall, their effectiveness.Liddel, Hart The second world war London, 1970Western Allied Tanks 1939-45, David Porter, 2009 The problem was a psychological command problem also, since infantry commanders were not keen on risking the few armored units they had at hand. At war, the T-13 was still prone to malfunctions and breakdowns, especially the elderly and underpowered B1 and B2 versions, although the hastily delivered T-13 B3 equipped units - which in some cases had been training on their new equipment for a few days only - had problems as well. For example, the 8th company of the 2nd regiment 'Grenswielrijders/Cyclistes-Fronti√®re' already had a broken down T-13 on the very first day of the Battle of Belgium, and had only four out of 12 left after 8 days of fighting: although some of these were knocked out in battle, at least half of them were lost due to mechanical breakdowns or to Luftwaffe bombing raids. The open topped T-13s were very vulnerable targets in an air attack, and the overwhelming air superiority of the Luftwaffe during the war in western Europe led to high losses. The vehicle was almost as vulnerable to artillery or even light mortar fire. The lack of a radio was another very important issue that often led to immobilized units, waiting for a single motorcyclist to act as a liaison. Very often armored units were only a few kilometers away from the fighting but were not aware of this fact or not allowed to proceed without orders. However, this was true for most western armored units during the battle for western Europe: indeed only the German Panzer groups were adequately equipped and had a good enough understanding of how important wireless communications were to be in a mobile battle. Most importantly however, the T-13s, very similar to British Light Tank Mk VI and French Renault R35 and Renault FT tanks, proved to be underarmored. Therefore, in spite of the big gun, they lacked the capability to act as a true mobile counter-armor weapon. Very often, when T-13s, T-15s and even the heavier Renault AMC 35s of the Belgian army tried to counterattack, the German 37 mm PAK and similarly equipped armored units inflicted heavy casualties. However, because of the political limitations on heavy weaponry mentioned earlier, neither the T-13 nor the T-15 had been designed for this mission. On the other hand, the 47 mm gun proved to be very valuable, and was effective against both light and heavy armored enemy units. On 10 May 1940, after it had crossed the small country of Luxemburg at night without encountering much resistance, the reconnaissance group of the German first Panzer division got pinned down by a single T-13 of the 4th company of the first mountain division 'Chasseurs Ardennais' at the border town of Martelange, a couple of armored vehicles getting knocked out in the process. On a different occasion, in the afternoon of 12 May 1940 the 3rd regiment 'Lansiers/Lanciers' of the Cavalry knocked out a German reconnaissance group that was advancing on the road between the towns of Zoutleeuw and Drieslinter, and succeeded in wiping it out completely, finishing off the remaining infantry with machine gun fire.'Summary of events and information' : war report of the British 12th Royal Lancers of the Royal Army on 13 May 1940 On one occasion, a single 47 mm hit pierced the hull of a Panzer IV on both sides of the vehicle, continuing its trajectory afterwards.http://www.bunkergordel.be Also, with four crew members assigned to each T-13 B3 (B1 and B2 versions had a crew of three), workload was well divided and when adequately trained, most T-13 equipped units were able to make good use of their tank destroyer. Confronted with soft targets, the T-13s fared well: T-13s participated in the successful counterattack at Kwatrecht near Gent on 20 May 1940, which succeeded in throwing back the Wehrmacht's 192nd and 234th infantry regiments, until British troops to the south of Oudenaarde received the order to evacuate to Dunkirk on 22 May 1940 and broke contact with the Belgian front one day later.Bond, Brian; Taylor, Michael (2001), The Battle of France and Flanders 1940, London: Leo Cooper, German use Confiscated Waffen-SS T-13 B3 somewhere in Belgium or northern France After the Battle of Belgium ended in German occupation on 28 May 1940, the Wehrmacht took over all usable T-13 vehicles that had not been sabotaged by their crews. They were hastily marked with Balken crosses to distinguish them from enemy units. Apparently, some of these participated in the war with the remaining French army, although it is unclear how many of the T-13s got used in this way. The German designation for this vehicle was \\"Panzerjaeger VA 802(b)\\". Most of these vehicles however had very likely never left Belgium, apart from being used for scrap metal later in the war. They were mostly assigned to driver training and target practice, light support duties, airfield security, counter insurgency and possibly as part of the Atlantikwall coastal defenses. However, apart from some photographic evidence, very little is known about the German use of the T-13.adjoining bunderarchiv picture, location unknown  Survivors  A single known surviving T-13 B2 exists at the Brussels Royal Museum of the Army and Military History.

It is the spiritual successor to Zombie Panic! Source. The game was mostly self-funded of its development, but with the support of others via a successful Kickstarter campaign, it was able to be released on Steam as an Early Access title. Contagion released on October 25, 2013 as a Steam Early Access title and was published as full release on April 11, 2014.  Gameplay  Contagion is a multiplayer focused game with 3 different game modes; Hunted, Escape, and Extraction. There is also a beta game mode called Flatline. Hunted, which supports up to 16 players, is a free-for-all \\"deathmatch\\" game mode in which players fight each other, while A.I.-controlled zombies wander the level and serve as an environmental hazard. When a player is killed, they respawn as a zombie and can participate alongside the A.I.-controlled zombies in attacking the surviving players. The goal of the game is to be the last living player. Escape is a cooperative game mode in which a team of up to 8 players is tasked with progressing through a level, fighting through zombies while completing various mission objectives in a linear order with the ultimate goal of escaping the map. Extraction is another cooperative game mode in which the goal is to explore an area and rescue a number of A.I.-controlled non-player character survivors. In both game modes, when a player is killed they respawn as a zombie and are tasked with helping the A.I.-controlled zombies hunt down the remaining human players. Player-controlled zombies are faster and more maneuverable than A.I.-controlled zombie enemies and therefore present a greater threat to human players. Both Escape and Extraction can be played off- line by a single player, although they are geared towards multi-player gameplay. Flatline is a multiplayer-geared wave based survival mode. The player starts in a singular location, where new parts of the map open every few waves. At the end of a wave, players who died the previous round are resurrected and all players have the option to visit a shop/safehouse and get better weapons/equipment. Contagion is distinguished from other similar games in the genre in that it features \\"Romero Zombies\\" (zombies akin to those seen in the Night of the Living Dead series of films by director George Romero). Resources such as weapons and ammunition are scarce, encouraging more precise and methodical gameplay. Unlike other games in the genre, Contagion does not feature zombies with special abilities, with the exception of a rare riot cop zombie wearing body armor that can survive significantly more damage than a regular zombie.

Globally, an estimated 1 to 2.5 million tons of active pesticide ingredients are used each year, mainly in agriculture. Forty percent are herbicides, followed by insecticides and fungicides. Since their initial development in the 1940s, multiple chemical pesticides with different uses and modes of action have been employed. Pesticides are applied over large areas in agriculture and urban settings. Pesticide use therefore represents an important source of diffuse chemical environmental inputs.  Persistence  In principle, pesticides are registered for use only after they are demonstrated not to persist in the environment considerably beyond their intended period of use. Typically, documented soil half-lives are in the range of days to weeks. However, pesticide residues are found ubiquitously in the environment in ng/liter to low Œºg/liter concentrations. For instance, surveys of groundwater and not-yet-treated potable water in industrialized countries typically detect 10 to 20 substances in recurrent findings above the maximum accepted drinking water concentration for pesticides in many countries. About half of the detected substances are no longer in use and another 10 to 20% are stable transformation products. Pesticide residues have been found in other realms. Transport from groundwater may lead to low-level presence in surface waters. Pesticides have been detected in high-altitude regions, demonstrating sufficient persistence to survive transport across hundreds of kilometers in the atmosphere. Degradation involves both biotic and abiotic transformation processes. Biotic transformation is mediated by microorganisms, while abiotic transformation involves processes such as chemical and photochemical reactions. The specific degradation processes for a given pesticide are determined by its structure and by the environmental conditions it experiences. Redox gradients in soils, sediments or aquifers often determine which transformations can occur. Similarly, photochemical transformations require sunlight, available only in the topmost meter(s) of lakes or rivers, plant surfaces or submillimeter soil layers. Atmospheric phototransformation is another potential remediating influence. Information on pesticide degradation is available from required test data. This includes laboratory tests on aqueous hydrolysis, photolysis in water and air, biodegradability in soils and water-sediment systems under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and fate in soil lysimeters. These studies provide little insight into how individual transformation processes contribute to observed degradation in situ. Therefore, they do not offer a rigorous understanding of how specific environmental conditions (e.g., the presence of certain reactants) affect degradation. Such studies further fail to cover unusual environmental conditions such as strongly sulfidic environments such as estuaries or prairie potholes, nor do they reveal transformations at low residual concentrations at which biodegradation may stop. Thus, although molecular structure generally predicts intrinsic reactivity, quantitative predictions are limited.  Biotic transformation  Biodegradation is generally recognized as biggest contributor to degradation. Whereas plants, animals and fungi (Eukaryota) typically transform pesticides for detoxification through metabolism by broad- spectrum enzymes, bacteria (Prokaryota) more commonly metabolize them. This dichotomy is likely due to a wider range of sensitive targets in Eukaryota. For example, organophosphate esters that interfere with nerve signal transmission in insects do not affect microbial processes and offering nourishment for microorganisms whose enzymes can hydrolyze phosphotriesters. Bacteria are more likely to contain such enzymes because of their strong selection for new enzymes and metabolic pathways that supply essential nutrients. In addition, genes move horizontally within microbial populations, spreading newly evolved degradation pathways. Some transformations, particularly substitutions, can proceed both biotically and abiotically, although enzyme-catalyzed reactions typically reach higher rates. For example, the hydrolytic dechlorination of atrazine to hydroxyatrazine in soil by atrazine-dechlorinating bacterial enzymes reached a second-order rate constant of 105/mole/second, likely dominating in the environment. In other cases, enzymes facilitate reactions with no abiotic counterpart, as with the herbicide glyphosate, which contains a C-P bond that is stable with respect to light, reflux in strong acid or base, and other abiotic conditions. Microbes that cleave the C-P bond are widespread in the environment, and some can metabolize glyphosate. The C-P lyase enzyme system is encoded by a complicated 14-gene operon. Biodegradation transformation intermediates may accumulate when the enzymes that produce the intermediate operate more slowly than those that consume it. In atrazine metabolism, for example, a substantial steady- state level of hydroxyatrazine accumulates from such a process. In other situations (e.g., in agricultural wastewater treatment), microorganisms mostly grow on other, more readily assimilable carbon substrates, whereas pesticides present at trace concentrations are transformed through fortuitous metabolism, producing potentially recalcitrant intermediates. Pesticides persist over decades in groundwater, although bacteria are in principle abundant and potentially able to degrade them for unknown reasons. This may be related to the observation that microbial degradation appears to stall at low pesticide concentrations in low-nutrient environments such as groundwater. As yet, very little is known about pesticide biodegradation under such conditions. Methods have been lacking to follow biodegradation in groundwater over the relevant long time scales and to isolate relevant degraders from such environments.  Abiotic Transformation  In surface waters, phototransformation can substantially contribute to degradation. In ‚Äúdirect‚Äù phototransformation, photons are absorbed by the contaminant, while in ‚Äúindirect‚Äù phototransformation, reactive species are formed through photon absorption by other substances. Pesticide electronic absorption spectra typically show little overlap with sunlight, such that only a few (e.g., trifluralin) are affected by direct phototransformation. Various photochemically active light absorbers are present in surface waters, enhancing indirect phototransformation. The most prominent is dissolved organic matter (DOM), which is the precursor of excited triplet states, molecular oxygen, superoxide radical anions, and other radicals. Nitrate and nitrite ions produce hydroxyl radicals under irradiation. Indirect phototransformation is thus the result of parallel reactions with all available reactive species. The transformation rate depends on the concentrations of all relevant reactive species, together with their corresponding second-order rate constants for a given pesticide. These constants are known for hydroxyl radical and molecular oxygen. In the absence of such rate constants, quantitative structure‚Äìactivity relationships(QSARs) may allow their estimation for a specific pesticide from its chemical structure. The relevance of \\"dark\\" (aphotic) abiotic transformations varies by pesticide. The presence of functional groups supports textbook predictions for some compounds. For example, aqueous abiotic hydrolysis degrades organophosphates, carboxylic acid esters, carbamates, carbonates, some halides (methyl bromide, propargyl) and many more. Other pesticides are less amenable. Conditions such as high pH or low-redox environments combined with in situ catalyst formation including (poly)sulfides, surface-bound Fe(II) or . Microorganisms often mediate the latter, blurring the boundary between abiotic and biotic transformations. Chemical reactions may also prevail in compartments such as groundwater or lake hypolimnions, which have hydraulic retention times on the order of years and where biomass densities are lower due to almost complete absence of assimilable organic carbon.  Prediction  Available strategies to identify in situ pesticide transformation include measuring remnant or transformation product concentrations and estimation of a given environment's theoretical transformation potential. Measurements are only usable on the micro- or mesocosm scale. Gas chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography‚Äìtandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) does not distinguish transformation from other processes such as dilution or sorption unless combined with stringent mass balance modeling. Carbon 14-labeled pesticides do enable mass balances, but investigations with radioactively tagged substrates cannot be conducted in the field. Transformation product detection may calibrate degradation. Target analysis is straightforward when products and standards are understood, while suspect/nontarget analysis can be attempted otherwise. High-resolution mass spectrometry facilitated the development of multicomponent analytical methods for 150 pesticide transformation products and for screening for suspected transformation products. In combination with transformation product structure models, screening allows a more comprehensive assessment of transformation products, independent of field degradation studies. Isotopic analysis may complement product measurements because it can measure degradation in the absence of metabolites and has the potential to cover sufficiently long time scales to assess transformation in groundwater. Isotope ratios (e.g.,/, /) can reveal history in the absence of any label. Because kinetic isotope effects typically favor transformation of light isotopes (e.g., ), heavy isotopes (13C) become enriched in residues. An increased / isotope ratio in a parent compound thus provides direct evidence of degradation. Repeated pesticide analyses, in groundwater over time, or direct measurements in combination with groundwater dating that show increasing / isotope ratios in a parent pesticide, provides direct evidence of degradation, even if the pesticide was released long before. Multiple transformation pathways were revealed for atrazine by measuring isotope effects of multiple elements. In such a case, transformation mechanisms are identifiable from plots of / versus / parent compound data, reflecting different underlying carbon- and nitrogen-isotope effects. The approach requires a relatively high amount of substance for gas chromatography‚Äìisotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IRMS) or LC-IRMS analysis (100 ng to 1 Œºg), which, for instance, requires extraction of 10 liters of groundwater at pesticide concentrations of 100 ng/liter. For the special case of chiral pesticides, enantiomer analysis may substitute for isotopes in such analyses as a result of stereoselective reactions. Combining isotope and chirality measurement can increase prediction strength. Geochemical analysis including pH, redox potential and dissolved ions is routinely applied to assess the potential for biotic and abiotic transformations, complicated by any lack of specificity in the targets. Selective probe compounds must be used to detect individual reactive species when a mixture of reactive species is present. Combining probe compounds and scavengers or quenchers increases accuracy. E.g., N,N-dimethylaniline, used as a probe for the carbonate radical reacts very quickly with DOM-excited triplet states and its oxidation is hampered by DOM. 13C-labeled parent pesticides were used in nontarget analysis of degraders by stable isotope probing (SIP) to demonstrate biotransformation potential in soil and sediment samples. A complementary, potentially more quantitative technique is to directly enumerate the biodegradative gene(s) via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR), gene sequencing or functional gene microarrays. A prerequisite for genetic approaches, however, is that the involved genes can be clearly linked to a given transformation reaction. For instance, the atzD gene encoding cyanuric acid hydrolase correlates with atrazine biodegradation in agricultural soil surface layers, consistent with AtzD's cleavage of the s-triazine ring during bacterial atrazine metabolism. AtzD was unambiguously identifiable and hence quantifiable, as unusually, it belongs to a protein family that largely consists of biodegradative enzymes. Most proteins studied to date are members of very large protein superfamilies, with as many as 600,000 individual members, with diverse functions. Another factor confounding gene-based approaches is that biodegradative function can arise independently in evolution, such that multiple unrelated genes catalyze the same reaction. E.g., organophosphate esterases that differ markedly in their fold and mechanism can act on the same organophosphate pesticide.  Transformation products  Even though their undesirable effects are typically lowered, transformation products may remain problematic. Some transformations leave active moiety intact, such as oxidation of thioethers to sulfones and sulfoxides. Parent/transformation product mixtures may have additive effects. Second, some products are more potent than their parents. Phenolic degradates of such diverse chemical classes as pyrethroids and aryloxyphenoxypropionic herbicides may act on estrogen receptor. Such products should receive particular attention because they are often smaller and more polar than their parents. This increases their potential to reach drinking water resources such as groundwater and surface waters, where polar products are found at fairly constant concentrations. Products in drinking water resources may cause problems such as formation of carcinogenic N-nitroso-dimethylamine from dimethylsulfamide, a microbial product of the fungicides tolylfluanide and dichlofluanide, during water treatment with ozone. The issue is specifically addressed in major regulatory frameworks. In Europe, for instance, ‚Äúnonrelevant‚Äù metabolites are distinguished from metabolites that are ‚Äúrelevant for groundwater resources‚Äù or even ‚Äúecotoxicologically relevant‚Äù. The latter are those whose risk to soil or aquatic biota is comparable or higher than the parent and must meet the same standards as their parent. Groundwater-relevant metabolites are those likely to reach groundwater in concentrations above 0.1 Œºg/liter and to display the same toxicity as the parent compound. In the past toxicology issues typically emerged only decades after market introduction. Examples are the detection of chloridazon products (first marketed in 1964) in surface and groundwater, or tolylfluanid (first marketed in 1971). That these substances were overlooked for so long may partially be attributable to prior limits on analytical capabilities. However, labeling some metabolites as nonrelevant may have resulted in directing attention away from them. The decision to tolerate up to 10 Œºg/liter of ‚Äúnonrelevant‚Äù metabolites in groundwater and drinking water is politically highly contentious in Europe. Some consider the higher limit acceptable as no imminent health risk can be proven, whereas others regard it as a fundamental deviation from the precautionary principle.

She is a radio and television presenter. Between 2012 and 2013 she hosted the radio program Preg√∫ntale a la Abogada (Ask the Attorney) on Univision Radio. Currently she hosts the weekly television immigration \\"√Ångel de la Justicia\\" on Univision's ¬°Despierta Am√©rica! and also appears on Primer Impacto's immigration segments. She is an advocate for immigration reform and has given commentary on the topic for media outlets including The Los Angeles Times. Early life and education Dominguez was born in Iquitos, Peru and raised in the Peru capital of Lima. When she was 14 years old, Dominguez moved to live with her mother who had left for the United States. She worked various jobs in local factories and she knew little of the English language and made it a goal to learn one new word per day. In Los Angeles, Dominguez dropped out of high school to work low paying jobs. While working at a McDonald's, a regular customer offered her a position at an insurance agency, answering phones for Spanish-speaking clients. Dominguez married Javier Dominguez, a dental technician that she met through the insurance agency. She earned her GED while attending night school while she was a stay-at-home mom. Dominguez completed her undergrad at Pierce College and Pepperdine University graduating in 1996. She went on to attend the University of La Verne College of Law where former Dean of the university, Robert Ackrich, hired her as a law clerk. She graduated with her J.D. in 2000. Career Dominguez started her career with a focus on family law but quickly moved to concentrating on immigration law. She became a volunteer for the Los Angeles County Bar Association Immigration Legal Assistance Project (ILAP). She began working for an immigration law firm where she represented Spanish-speaking clients. In 2002 she founded the Law Offices of Jessica Dominguez, which were then located in Canoga Park, California. In recent years she began using social media to educate members of the community about their rights under immigration law. She has become known for her use of social media in the field of law, using it as a medium that has traditionally not been used by attorneys. One of the first notable cases handled by Dominguez was that of a Mexican woman who was sold as a sex slave when she was 16 years old. The woman witnessed a man's murder, which was carried out by a neighbor. The neighbor instructed her to hide the weapon and she was later accused of murder. After serving 22 years in prison, she was ordered deported. Dominguez organized a team of supporters - that included Marta Sahag√∫n de Fox and Hilda Solis who was then a congresswoman - to fight for the release and oppose the deportation of the woman. The case drew international attention and the woman was quoted as saying \\"she is my angel,\\" which ran in a story in La Opini√≥n, leading to Dominguez being known as \\"el angel de la justicia\\" (The Angel of Justice). Dominguez represented many families who were victims in the 2012 Miramonte Elementary School abuse scandal. The school had a high enrollment of poor Latino families, some of which were in the country without documents. The teacher at the school plead no contest to numerous sex crimes and was sentenced to 25 years in prison. Dominguez represented families of victims who were scared to come forward for fear of deportation. Dominguez requested assurance that families would not be deported after coming forward. She also represented 8 of the victimized families in a civil lawsuit against the school district. Early in her career, Dominguez attended an immigration workshop in Los Angeles where a broadcast reporter was looking for someone to immigration explain immigration law in Spanish. Dominguez completed the task which led to more television appearances. She was eventually asked to be a presenter for her own weekly segment \\"√Ångel de la Justicia\\" on Univision's ¬°Despierta Am√©rica!, the highest rated morning show among Latinos in the United States. She also has regular appearances in segments on Primer Impacto. Dominguez has provided commentary for The Huffington Post, where she is also a contributor.

The game consists of a number of 3D levels which must be navigated while avoiding previous versions of yourself created by time travel. The game was originally released in April 2012 for iOS and Android, having been created as part of the Indie Buskers Game Jam. It was also released on Ouya in July 2013. Gameplay The player controls Rose, a young girl in pursuit of a time crystal which she believes will give her the ability to understand time travel, and rescue her parents who are trapped in a time loop. Each stage consists of a series of floating platforms and mechanisms she must navigate to reach the crystal. Upon reaching the crystal, you travel back in time to the start of the level, to find yourself and the crystal are in different positions, and you now have to avoid your past self (and her line of sight) to reach the crystal without causing a Time paradox. Many later levels involve managing several versions of your past self, and using them to hold buttons activating doors and platforms. Aside from moving, the only actions Rose can perform are covering her eyes (to create blind spots for her future selves to pass through) and rewinding time to an earlier point to correct mistakes. Ouya controversy In September 2013, Sophie voluntarily withdrew the game from the Ouya marketplace, citing problems with the mishandling of the Ouya \\"Free the Games Fund\\" controversy, and assorted missteps by the company. The story was widely circulated in the gaming press, and further fueled criticism of the fund. A month later, Sophie revealed that she and several other developers had been in talks with Ouya boss Julie Uhrman, and that the terms of the free the games fund had been changed as a result. Satisfied the matter was resolve, she returned the game to the Ouya marketplace.

Begun around 1870, when the area was part of Austria-Hungary, the works underwent a powerful expansion following nationalization in 1948 by the nascent Communist regime, making a vital contribution to the growth of the town. Privatization in the late 1990s proved unsuccessful, and the works were largely abandoned within a decade, leading to economic hardship for CƒÉlan. History=Beginnings in Austria-Hungary In 1867, the administration of the Bra»ôov Mining and Metallurgy Company (Kronst√§dter Bergbau- und H√ºttenvereins-Komplexes), headed by Prince Maximilian Egon I of F√ºrstenberg, purchased land for a steel works. The land, covering some 104 ha including swamps, came from the wife of a Hungarian nobleman. In 1868, German engineer Otto Gmelin was hired to draw up plans for the new enterprise. The decision to build at CƒÉlan was closely related to the fact that a railway line was being laid between Simeria and Petro»ôani, and work intensified at CƒÉlan once this line was complete. Ioachim LazƒÉr, \\"De la cuptorul de la Valea Caselor (Ghelari) la primele furnale de la CƒÉlan ≈üi Hunedoara\\", in Ioan Sebastian Bara, Denisa Toma, Ioachim LazƒÉr (eds.), in Jude»õul Hunedoara, Monografie, Volumul 2 (Economie »ôi Societate), p.144-45. Biblioteca Jude≈£eanƒÉ ‚ÄûOvid Densusianu‚Äù Hunedoara - Deva, 2012, The first furnace was built starting on May 25, 1869 by the Bra»ôov company, which also held the Teliuc mine. Inaugurated in the winter of 1871, it had a capacity of 82 m3. The second furnace started being built in 1874 and went operational the following year. Josef Massenez, a Belgian, supervised the construction work. Ore and dolomite used in production came straight from Teliuc. A foundry was begun in 1876, with two cupola furnaces added the following year. At first, employees lived in houses on partly swampy ground surrounding the works. Ten houses were built in 1870; the total had risen to 78 by 1918. An administrative building and laboratory were also erected in 1870, while the narrow gauge railway for carrying ore from Teliuc on horse-drawn carts began to be laid down. During the early years, a casting room was finished, as well as a mechanical shop featuring a steam engine that ran the machines. Before the furnace was finished, production was centered in the latter unit, with ore, molten iron and fuel brought in using steam pressure. The platform and elevator were made of wood; the latter ran on steam power as well. A railway from Teliuc to CƒÉlan was built in 1875 because horses were unable to deliver enough raw materials to meet the factory's needs. The railway, a 16.5-km section of narrow gauge track, was used by steam locomotives. The foundry was begun in 1876 and incorporated parts brought from the Ru»ôchi»õa factory. In 1877, the room for moulding and casting was completed, as were the cleaning unit and warehouse for cast objects, and the cupola furnaces began running. By 1881, the works were converting cast iron into steel in a division that included a puddling oven, a steam hammer and rolling mills able to produce 4000 tons of steel annually. In 1896, the original second furnace was replaced by a new structure that was 380 m3 in volume and could turn out 120 to 140 tons of cast iron daily. In 1897, the CƒÉlan Mines and Metallurgy Anonymous Society was set up as a joint-stock company; aside from the CƒÉlan works, this entity acquired the Teliuc mine and the factories at Ru»ôchi»õa and O»õelu Ro»ôu from the Bra»ôov company. The water supply mechanism introduced in 1899 included a dam on the Strei River, two sluice gates, two settling basins, two infiltration basins, a 2450-m long concrete canal and a collecting pool. The two steam pumps provided water flow of up two 240 m3 per hour at a pressure of two atm. A unit for casting pieces for heavy machinery was built in 1908; this was extended in 1914 by adding a room for manufacturing commercial products. In 1911, the factory was bought by the Budapest-based Rimamur√°ny‚ÄìSalg√≥tarj√°n Iron Works,Serafin MƒÉrgan, DouƒÉ secole de metalurgie pe Valea Bistrei, p.75. Editura Timpul, 1996, which remained the owner until 1924. In 1918, the furnaces stopped for a period of sixteen years, a main reason being a lack of coke and coal. In turn, these fuels were scarce because of difficulties in transporting along the railways from the coal-producing Jiu Valley.Studia Universitatis Babe»ô-Bolyai ‚Äî Historia (Cluj: Babe»ô-Bolyai University), vol.18-19, 1973, p.122 There were 1116 employees in 1916. \\"Cum a ajuns sƒÉ cultive canabis industria lui Ceau≈üescu\\", G√¢ndul, November 1, 2010; accessed February 12, 2014 Interwar period With the fuel shortage at hand, production was slow and inefficient between 1919 and 1921. In 1924, several years after the union of Transylvania with Romania, the works were involved in a restructuring that gave them a new owner in the process. A Bucharest- headquartered S.A. that owned the plants at Gala≈£i and at NƒÉdrag took on CƒÉlan; the Chrissoveloni Bank and Max Auschnitt were also involved in the deal. Town Presentation at the CƒÉlan Town Hall site; accessed February 12, 2014 Daniel Gu≈£ƒÉ, \\"Cum a dispƒÉrut 'Victoria' CƒÉlan, una dintre marile uzine ale Transilvaniei\\", AdevƒÉrul, April 27, 2013; accessed February 12, 2014 The new concern that emerged from these moves, called the Titan SAR Metallurgical Plants, ended up owning the works at CƒÉlan, O»õelu Ro»ôu, Gala≈£i and NƒÉdrag, as well as the Teliuc mine. Once rolling mills started operating at O»õelu Ro»ôu, the foundry there and the workers who ran it were sent to CƒÉlan in mid-1926. Following the economic crisis of the Great Depression (1929-1933), several investments became feasible. The Strei River hydroelectric power station was completed in November 1934; the plant was modernized and the furnaces were brought back into action. There were forty engineers and foremen and 671 workers in 1927; by 1938, the total number of employees stood at 1117. During World War II, the works suffered a certain amount of damage. Communist era In 1948, the new Communist regime nationalized the works, and the existing factory was expanded into a steel-manufacturing complex. In 1953, two semi-coking batteries started to be built. These became operational in 1956 and 1957 respectively, but were soon shut down due to lack of productivity. 1957 saw the introduction of the first carburizing oven, used to manufacture semi-coke by fluidization. Both of the old furnaces were rebuilt: the second, with a capacity of 250 m3, entered production in 1952. The first, with a similar capacity, was ready in 1959. The furnaces relied on coke and methane gas for combustible material. In 1958, building started on a new foundry that was able to turn out 40,000 tons of ingots and parts annually. A new workshop was inaugurated in 1964, which allowed for on-site repair and production of replacement pieces. Its features included fifteen lathes, a machine repair unit, four lathes for straightening rolling mill cylinders, a carousel lathe, a planer and two all-purpose cutters. Workers were housed on site in apartment blocks. The first of these, as well as an apprentices' school, appeared in 1949-1952. A new neighborhood of blocks for workers began to be built in 1959 on the sloping right bank of the Strei, in the vicinity of the Streis√¢ngeorgiu Church. In 1961, due to its economic importance, CƒÉlan commune was declared a town. In 1930, the population numbered 6801; this had risen to 14,738 by 1992. Historical census data A prominent player in the Romanian steel industry, the works produced gray iron, coke, coal, tar and castings, including stoves and radiators. By the 1980s, the complex employed some 8000 individuals from the town and its surroundings. Town History at the CƒÉlan Town Hall site; accessed February 12, 2014 Rapid development under communism gave way after the 1989 Revolution to a slow disintegration. Privatization and aftermath In the wake of the Revolution, there were over 6000 employees at the works, which covered more than 200 ha at the time. Starting in 1995, several million dollars were invested into production of ductile iron tubes in the second furnace, an achievement mentioned by President Ion Iliescu during the following year's re-election campaign. However, the unit lay idle within a few years. \\"Republica CƒÉlan √Æ»ôi alungƒÉ unicul investitor strƒÉin\\", Evenimentul Zilei, July 12, 2002; accessed February 12, 2014 Privatization took place in 1998, when the works, by that time employing 1500, were broken up into twelve companies that began to go bankrupt one by one. The core business among these, called Sidermet, produced iron tubes.Remus Cre»õan, Liliana Guran-Nica, Dan Platon and David Turnock, \\"Foreign Direct Investment and Social Risk in Romania: Progress in Less-Favoured Areas\\", in Francis Carter, David Turnock (eds.), Foreign Direct Investment and Regional Development in East Central Europe and the Former Soviet Union, p.324. Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2005, This company was sold by the state in 2003 and its new owners filed for bankruptcy in late 2005. By that point, Sidermet had 200 employees remaining, for the sole purposes of safeguarding and maintenance of the site. \\"Fabrica- unicat in filament for≈£at\\", Evenimentul Zilei, January 4, 2006; accessed February 12, 2014 In 2010, there were two firms left standing, with under seventy employees. Much of the structure had been stolen for its scrap iron, and what was still functioning was under frequent threat from metal thieves. The scrap iron would be sorted and sold on land that was part of the works. Effects of the closure on the town included elevated unemployment and pollution, although efforts were underway to clean up part of the site. In the works' heyday, the furnaces would emit dark exhaust that blackened the sky above CƒÉlan and the coke odor made the air difficult to breathe. In September 1982, the waters of the Strei changed color, with hundreds or perhaps thousands of dead fish floating in them. This was caused by excessive dumping of toxins from the works, and somewhat unusually given the censorship in Communist Romania, was mentioned later that year in FlacƒÉra.Nicolae Stroescu- St√Æni»ôoarƒÉ, La rƒÉscruce: g√¢nduri spuse la Radio Europa LiberƒÉ »ôi √Æn Jurnalul literar, p.146.

Most of the poems in the collection reflect on the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), including the elegies \\"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\\" and \\"O Captain! My Captain!\\", which were written in response to the 1865 assassination of Abraham Lincoln. The poems of this book were later included in Leaves of Grass, Whitman's comprehensive collection of his poetry that was frequently expanded throughout his life. Background At the start of the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), Whitman moved from New York City to Washington, D.C. where he obtained work in a series of government offices, at first with the Army Paymaster's Office and later with the Bureau of Indian Affairs.Callow, Philip. 1992.

Walt Whitman: The Song of Himself, (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999), 283 He volunteered as a nurse in the army hospitals. His experience as a nurse informed his poetry, which matured into reflections on death and youth, the brutality of war, and patriotism; and offered stark images and vignettes of the war.Miller, Edwin Haviland, ed. 1961. The Correspondence 1. New York: New York University Press. p. 68‚Äì70. Many of his Civil War poems were assembled into a collection that Whitman titled Drum-Taps. After the publication and printing of Drum-Taps in Brooklyn in April 1865, Whitman intended to supplement the collection with several additional Civil War poems and a handful of new poems mourning the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln that he had written between April and June 1865. After returning to Washington, D.C., in Summer 1865, Whitman contracted with Gibson Brothers to publish a pamphlet of eighteen poems‚Äîwhich he intended to include with copies of Drum-TapsPrice, Kenneth, and Ed Folsom. 2005.

In October, after the pamphlet was printed, Whitman travelled to Brooklyn to collate and bind them into copies of Drum-Taps. He added the poems from Drum- Taps and Sequel to Drum-Taps as a supplement to the fourth edition of Leaves of Grass, printed in 1867 by William E. Chapin.Whitman, Walt.

As an immigrant port of entry and border town between North and South and as a manufacturing center in its own right, Baltimore has been well-positioned to reflect developments in American Jewish life. Yet, the Jewish community of Baltimore has maintained its own distinctive character as well.  Earliest Jews in Baltimore  The 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia states: In 1781 Jacob Hart, father-in-law of Haym Salomon, headed a subscription of ¬£2,000 ($10,000) loaned to Lafayette for the relief of the detachment under his command.

Jewish cemetery in 1786  The existence of a Jewish cemetery in 1786 indicates a Jewish community of some size. How long previous to that year the cemetery had been established is not known. The earliest mention of it occurs in a document (the document was in the possession of Mr. Mendes Cohen of Baltimore), dated July 12, 1786, headed \\"Mr. Carroll's [Charles Carroll of Carrollton] claims\\". It is a \\"list of the names of the Persons who occupy the ground (supposed to be about 2 acres) on the east side of Jones's Falls, . . . with an account of the improvements\\". One of the items is \\"The Jews burying- ground, 1 small lot enclosed\\", situated in Ensor's Town, near East Monument street. A deed dated Dec. 26, 1801, conveys this same burying-ground from Charles Carroll to Levi Solomon and Solomon Etting, for a consideration of five shillings; and another, dated Dec. 29, 1801, for a consideration of $80, conveys it to the same parties from Wm. McMechen and John Leggett. Interment has been made in it as late as 1832, the same year in which the oldest Jewish cemetery now in use was established. No indications can be discovered of the removal of remains buried in it when the cemetery was abandoned. According to the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia:  The Etting family  With the advent of the Etting family, the history of the Jewish community in Baltimore becomes better documented. It is uncertain when the Etting brothers, Reuben and Solomon, together with Levi Solomon, their uncle, came to Baltimore from York, Pa. On Jan. 4, 1796, Solomon Etting's name appears in the \\"Advertiser\\" as one of five persons authorized \\"to receive proposals in writing for a house or suitable lot\\" for a bank to be established in Baltimore Town. But there are indirect indications that the family settled in Baltimore before 1787. In the list of stockholders of the same bank, published at the end of 1796, appear the following names: Solomon, Kitty, Reuben, Shinah, and Hetty Etting; Jacob F., Philadelphia, Benjamin, and Hetty Levy; and Levy and Myer Solomon. In the first directory of \\"Baltimore Town and Fell's Point\\", also published in 1796 ‚Äì the year of the incorporation of Baltimore as a city ‚Äì there are, in addition to the above, two Harts, three Jacobs, Philip Itzchkin, ‚Äì Kahn, Benjamin Lyon, Solomon Raphael, and Isaac Solomon; and in the lists of letters remaining at the post-office occur the names of Hhym Levenstene and Benjamin Myers. Accordingly, the Jewish Encyclopedia estimates the Jewish population of Baltimore in 1796 at fifteen families.  Jews elected to City Council  In 1798 the Collmus family arrived from Bohemia; and in 1808 the six sons of Israel J. Cohen came, with their mother, from Richmond, Va. The Cohens and the Ettings played a prominent part in the history of Baltimore Jewry, and in that of the city also. Both families acquired an enviable reputation for integrity and business tact; and their members were honored with offices of trust, by corporations and in the city government. Their names figure most prominently in the emancipation struggle of 1818‚Äì26, during which time the \\"Jew Bill\\" was debated in the legislature of Maryland. This bill proposed \\"to consider the justice and expediency of extending to those persons professing the Jewish religion the same privileges that are enjoyed by Christians\\". Immediately upon its passage, and its ratification in the legislative session of 1825‚Äì26, it was applied practically in the election of Solomon Etting and Jacob I. Cohen, JR., to seats in the city council of Baltimore. In more recent times, the 5th District has been represented by two Jews, first by Rochelle \\"Rikki\\" Spector from 1997‚Äì2016, and then by Isaac \\"Yitzy\\" Schleifer since 2016, who is the second openly Orthodox Jew to hold office in Baltimore City.  Organization of Religious worship  After 1826 the recorded history of the Jews of Baltimore ceases to be the history of prominent individuals, and becomes that of a community. Almost coincidentally with the removal of civil disabilities occurs the first of a series of regular meetings for religious services, whose continuity has been uninterrupted. According to the recollections of one participant, this meeting took place in Holliday street, near Pleasant street, at the house of Zalma Rehin√©, a former resident of Richmond, Va., and an uncle of Isaac Leeser. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, this may possibly have been the beginning of the congregation Nidche Israel, later known as the \\"Baltimore Hebrew Congregation,\\" or as the \\"Stadt-Schul\\", probably because almost simultaneously with its origin another settlement of Jews, at Fell's Point ‚Äì an outlying and at first separate district ‚Äì began to crystallize into a congregation, called the \\"Fell's Point Hebrew Friendship Congregation\\", and regularly organized since 1838. The Nidche Israel soon found it necessary to rent rooms on North Exeter street, near what is now Lexington street. Thence the congregation moved to a one-story dwelling off High street, near the bend between Fayette and Gay streets, or near what is now Lexington street, the entrance being through a narrow alley. In 1837 a three-story brick building was bought, at the southwest corner of Harrison street and √Ütna lane. In 1845 the congregation removed to Lloyd and Watson streets, the new synagogue being dedicated by the Rev. S. M. Isaacs of New York and the Rev. Isaac Leeser of Philadelphia, together with the ministers of the congregation, A. Rice and A. Ansell (Anshel). Here it worshiped until April 6, 1889, when a new building was erected on Madison avenue and Robert street. The date of the congregational charter is Jan. 29, 1830 (supplementary act, 1851). The incorporators were Moses Millem (Mulheim), Joseph Osterman, John M. Dyer, Louis Silver, and Levi Benjamin. The first rabbi of the congregation was the above-mentioned Abraham Rice (Reiss), whose piety and character have left a lasting impress upon the community, especially through his influence upon the youths he taught, some of them later becoming its leaders. Rice established a school for instruction in Hebrew in 1845, and he officiated as the rabbi of the congregation from 1840 to 1849, and again from the spring of 1862 to Oct. 29 of the same year, the date of his death. Other rabbis of the congregation have been: Julius Spiro, in conjunction with Mr. Rice (1846‚Äì47); Henry Hochheimer (1849‚Äì59); B. Illoway (1859‚Äì61); Abraham Hofman (1868‚Äì73); Maurice Fluegel (1881‚Äì84); A. S. Bettelheim (1886‚Äì90); and Adolf Guttmacher (1891). The burial-ground belonging to the congregation was bought in 1832, at which time it covered three acres. Rabbis of the Fell's Point Congregation, later worshiping on Eden street, have been: Aaron G√ºnzburg (1848‚Äì56); Henry Hochheimer (1859‚Äì92); W. Willner (1892‚Äì94); Clifton H. Levy (1894‚Äì96): and M. Rosenstein (1896). This congregation, as well as the one or two chebrot of which records up to 1842 have been preserved, had separated from, or organized themselves independently of, the mother congregation, Nidche Israel, only for reasons of convenience, on account of the extended space over which the community was scattered. In 1842 the desire for a radical change in the liturgy resulted in the formation of the Har Sinai Verein, whose rabbis have been: Max Sutro (about 1842); Moritz Brown (about 1849‚Äì55); David Einhorn (1855‚Äì61); S. Deutsch (1862‚Äì73); Jacob Mayer (1874‚Äì76); Emil G. Hirsch (1877‚Äì78); S. Sale (1878‚Äì83); David Philipson (1884‚Äì88); Tobias Shanfarber (1888‚Äì98); and Charles A. Rubenstein (1898). The congregation later erected a new house of worship on Bolton and Wilson streets. In 1873, a new charter was granted and the name was changed from Har Sinai Verein to Har Sinai Congregation.  \\"Oheb Shalom\\" Congregation  A similar desire for a revised liturgy, but along more conservative lines, led to the formation of the Oheb Shalom Congregation in Sept., 1853, on the part of a number of dissidents from the original body. Rabbis of this congregation, whose new synagogue on Eutaw place and Lanvale street was considered one of the most beautiful structures in the city, have been the following: ‚Äì Salomon (1854); S. M. Landsberg (1856‚Äì57); Benjamin Szold; and William Rosenau (1892). Alois Kaiser, known as a composer of synagogue music, has been the cantor of this congregation since 1866. This was followed by the formation of three Orthodox congregations, the earliest of which was the Bikur Cholim Congregation, incorporated in 1865. The Chizuk Emoonah Congregation was formed in 1871 by dissidents from the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation, which had begun to introduce innovations into the synagogue service. The rabbi of the Chizuk Emoonah was Henry W. Schneeberger, who has occupied the rabbinate since 1876. A new synagogue has later been built by the congregation at McCulloh and Mosher streets. In 1878, the Shearith Israel Congregation was formed by the consolidation of two small congregations. S. Schaffer was its rabbi since 1893. Since then, in the organization of twenty other congregations in Baltimore ‚Äì only eight of which having a house of worship of their own ‚Äì the determining factor, in a few cases, has been convenience of locality, but more frequently the bond of national affiliation brought from European countries and reinforced by conservatism in religious sentiment. An attempt was made in 1856‚Äì59 to hold services according to the liturgy of the Spanish and Portuguese Sephardim, of which Solomon Nunes Carvalho was the chief promoter. The congregation was regularly organized in 1857, under the name \\"Beth Israel\\", with Jacob M. De Solla as minister. Of the eight large cemeteries in the city, one, called \\"Rosedale\\", was used by seven congregations and three societies; another, on the Philadelphia road, by eight congregations and two societies; and a third, on the Washington road, by three congregations and one society. Each of five congregations, the Baltimore Hebrew, the Fell's Point, the Har Sinai, the Oheb Shalom, and the B'nai Israel, had a cemetery of its own. Besides, there was a small cemetery, now disused, on the Philadelphia road, which was formerly maintained by what was called, for unknown reasons, \\"Die Irische ·∏§ebra\\". The Cohen family and the Etting family owned private cemeteries.  Charitable societies  The first charitable association was the Hebrew Assistance Society (1843?), incorporated in 1856 as the \\"Hebrew Benevolent Society of Baltimore\\". In the latter year was founded also the Hebrew Ladies' Sewing Society, which, though an independent body, has always adapted its activities to those of the general organization. The building of the Hebrew Hospital and Asylum Association ‚Äì a society for the care of the sick and the shelter of the aged ‚Äì was dedicated in 1868, the first steps toward this end having been taken in 1859; and in 1872 the Hebrew Orphan Asylum was established. Both these institutions had active auxiliary organizations. The other charitable institutions with permanent homes were the Hebrew Friendly Inn and Aged Home, established in 1891, and the Working Girls' Home, founded in 1899 by the Daughters in Israel, and supported by that association. There were, besides, two Hebrew free burial societies, a Hebrew free loan association, the Daughters in Israel of Baltimore City (a personal service sisterhood with various activities), and a number of mutual benefit and relief associations. The Baron de Hirsch Fund from the first established a local committee in Baltimore whose affairs have been administered by Dr. A. Friedenwald.  Educational establishments  Congregational schools, at which daily instruction was given in Hebrew and German, and later in English, flourished until after 1870. The most successful were conducted by Joseph Sachs and Jonas Goldsmith. The Society for Educating Poor and Orphan Hebrew Children (later named \\"Hebrew Education Society of Baltimore\\") was founded in 1852, and incorporated in 1860. In 1901, it had two schools, a daily Hebrew school, and a weekly mission school for religious instruction, whose work was supplemented by that of the Frank Free Sabbath School, established and supported by Mrs. S. L. Frank. The first Sunday school, patterned after the one founded by Miss Rebecca Gratz in Philadelphia, was opened in 1856. In it a large number of children were taught during the years preceding the establishment of congregational religious schools. The Talmud Torah School, with a building of its own, was established in 1889, and the Hebrew Free Kindergarten and Day Nursery in 1895. The organization known as \\"The Maccabeans\\" maintained an evening class and a library for the use of boys and young men; continuing in a measure the work begun by the Night School, existing from 1889 to 1899 under the auspices of the Isaac bar Levison Hebrew Literary Society, and supported in part by the Baron de Hirsch Fund, for the purpose of teaching English to immigrants. At three different times short-lived attempts have been made to maintain Young Men's Hebrew associations, the first of which existed from 1854 to 1860. There were three Zionist societies; a branch of the Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle; a section and a junior section of the Council of Jewish Women; six lodges of the Independent Order B'nai B'rith; three of the Independent Order B'rith Abraham; one of the Independent Order Free Sons of Israel; three of the Independent Order Free Sons of Judah; four of the Independent Order Sons of Benjamin; five of the Order Ahawas Israel; seven of the Order B'rith Abraham; and one of the Order Kesher Shel Barzel. Chabad continues the legacy of Jewish education in Baltimore.  Newspapers  The Jewish newspapers published in Baltimore have been: \\"Sinai\\" (a German periodical devoted to interests of radical reform, edited by Dr. David Einhorn, 1856‚Äì61, and one year in Philadelphia); \\"The Jewish Chronicle\\" (1875‚Äì77); \\"Der Fortschritt\\" (Yiddish, June‚ÄìJuly, 1890); \\"Der Baltimore Israelit\\" (Yiddish, 1891‚Äì93); \\"Ha-Pisgah\\" (Hebrew, 1891‚Äì93, continued in Chicago); \\"Jewish Comment\\" (1895); \\"Der Wegweiser\\" (Yiddish, 1896); and the Baltimore Jewish Times.  Public and professional life  The Jews of Baltimore have participated fully in the civic life of the town and the state, and have taken some part in national affairs. In the city, Jews have filled numerous minor offices, notably as councilmen, justices of the peace, supervisors of elections, and in the city law department, as well as on boards and special commissions. Myer Block was judge of the Orphans' Court in Baltimore; Jacob H. Hollander was secretary to the International Bimetallic Commission, and the first treasurer of Porto Rico under American jurisdiction. Isidor Rayner served as representative in the fiftieth, the fifty-second, and the fifty-third congresses, after having sat in the House of Delegates and the Senate of the state; later he was attorney-general of the state. Among the state senators have been Jacob M. Moses and Lewis Putzel; and among the delegates: Mendes I. Cohen, Martin Emerich, Harry A. Fuld, M. S. Hess, Emanuel H. Jacobi, Martin Lehmayer, Lewis Putzel, and Charles J. Wiener. In the business world the Jews of Baltimore have occupied an important position. To a great extent they controlled the manufacture of wearing apparel for men. Several of the largest department stores were conducted by Jews; and as financiers they bore an enviable reputation for probity and for a spirit of far-sighted and cautious enterprise. Baltimore Jews have had prominent representatives in all the professions. Jewish physicians, men and women, have occupied positions as professors in the medical colleges, including: A. B. Arnold, Joshua I. Cohen, Aaron Friedenwald, Harry Friedenwald, and Julius Friedenwald. Jews have devoted themselves to the writing of medical and legal works. There were Jewish journalists on the editorial staffs of several of the daily newspapers. The following Jews have been connected with Johns Hopkins University in the capacity of professors and instructors: J. J. Sylvester, Fabian Franklin, Abraham Cohen, Maurice Bloomfield, Cyrus Adler, J. H. Hollander, Simon Flexner, Caspar Levias, and William Rosenau. In the public schools upward of sixty Jewish teachers were employed. Ephraim Keyser has won reputation as a sculptor, and Mendes Cohen as a civil engineer. The wider educational life has found promoters among the Jews. Jacob I. Cohen, JR., was active in the establishment of the public-school system of Baltimore; and his nephews were instrumental in placing in the Johns Hopkins University the \\"Cohen Collection of Egyptian Antiquities\\", collected by his brother, Col. Mendes I. Cohen, in Egypt. At the same university Leopold Strouse established a rabbinical library, to which he made annual additions; Mrs. S. L. Frank and Albert W. Rayner have founded a Semitic fellowship in memory of their father, William S. Rayner; and Henry and Mrs. Sonneborn have presented the university with a collection of Jewish ceremonial objects. At the Cohen residence was a library valuable to Bible students, collected by Dr. Joshua I. Cohen (a catalogue of this library, compiled by Cyrus Adler, was privately printed in 1887).  Military services  Jews enlisted from Baltimore for service in each of the national wars. Nathaniel Levy fought under Lafayette in the campaign of 1781; and Reuben Etting (not the one mentioned above) was taken prisoner by the British at Charlestown. Among the defenders of Fort McHenry, near Baltimore, during the War of 1812, were the brothers Mendes I. and Philip I. Cohen. In the Mexican war, Moritz Henry Weil served as a private in Company A, Third Regiment, United States Artillery, and Louis Hamburger as a private in Company C, Baltimore Battalion. According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, \\"[a] company of militia composed entirely of Jews was formed, with Levi Benjamin as first lieutenant; but it is not probable that it saw active service\\". In the Civil war there were as many Baltimore Jews in the Confederate as in the Federal army. Leopold Blumenberg served as brevet brigadier-general, United States Volunteers, Fifth Maryland Infantry (see S. Wolf, The American Jew as Patriot, Soldier, and Citizen, pp. 199, 200, 412). To the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Baltimore Jewry sent its due quota of soldiers (see American Jewish Year Book 5661, pp. 563‚Äì565). A few street names reveal the early presence of Jews: According to the Jewish Encyclopedia, there were two alleys, each called \\"Jew alley\\", one in the eastern section of the city, on which the old burying- ground is situated; and the other in the western section, probably deriving its name from residences of Jews on Eutaw street; Abraham street, in close proximity to the old burying-ground; Cohen alley, so named from the residence of one of the Cohen brothers on Mulberry street; and Etting street, of obvious derivation.  Statistics  In 1825, while the \\"Jew Bill\\" was under discussion, Solomon Etting computed the number of Jews in Maryland to be 150. A directory of 1835 gives the names of 40 householders in Baltimore, identified as Jews by a Jewish resident whose memory goes back to that year. To these can be added at least 15 more names culled from the records of the Baltimore Hebrew Congregation, making a Jewish population of about 300 souls, bearing such names as Cohen, Dyer, Friedenwald, Horwitz, Kayton, Keyser, Preiss, and Rosenstock, whose descendants continued to be prominent in Baltimore and other cities. In the \\"Occident\\" of Dec., 1856, an anonymous correspondent put the number of Jews then residing in the city at 8,000 ‚Äì an exaggerated estimate according to the Jewish Encyclopedia. In 1901 estimates of the Jewish population varied from 35,000 to 40,000, in a total population of 508,957.

It is rare and critically endangered in many of its habitats. Coscinium fenestratum is a member of the family Menispermaceae and the genus Coscinium. The plant is known by many different names, such as: Tree turmeric, False calumba, Colombo weed, Weniwel, Daru Haridra (in Sanskrit), Mara Manjal (in Tamil and Malayalam), Haem herb (in Thai),Coscinium Usitatum Health & Herbals Voer Romiet (in Khmer),Ashwell, D. and Walston, N. (2008): An overview of the use and trade of plants and animals in traditional medicine systems in Cambodia. TRAFFIC Southeast Asia, Greater Mekong Programme, Ha Noi, Viet Nam. etc.. Description Coscinium fenestratum is a sturdy woody climber with leathery, shiny leaves and bright yellow sap. It is dioecious, flowering and fruiting in August to October. The fruits consists of one or two drupes up to across. The plant has a generation span of 25 years. Distribution The habitat for Coscinium fenestratum spans South Asia and parts of Southeast Asia, from India to Indonesia. It can only thrive in a tropical climate and prefers mixed and dense evergreen forest, with fertile soil and high moisture. The plant has been determined to be native to Sri Lanka and the Western Ghats in India. It is unclear if the populations in Cambodia, Vietnam and west Malaysia are truly wild or the result of cultivation. Use Coscinium fenestratum has a long history as a medicinal plant in the various traditional medicines of the region where it grows. This includes Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha medicine in India, Sinhala medicine in Sri Lanka, the Kru Khmer healing traditions in Cambodia, traditional Vietnamese medicine of Thuoc Nam, etc.. The plant is used for a large variety of diseases and conditions, from fevers and diabetes to celiac disease and snake bites. It is unclear if all these medicinal uses of C. fenestratum are backed up by science, but laboratory tests have shown that the plant has potent bioactive properties. There is speculation that C. fenestratum might also have found a modern use in the illegal drug market industry.See the documentary film: \\"Death in the Forest\\". Speculation on the potential drug use of yellow vine.  Bioactive compounds  The primary bioactive ingredient in Coscinium fenestratum is berberine, but also palmatine and jatrorrhizine. Critically endangered Because of the growing populations and industrialization of Asia, the demand for Coscinium fenestratum has increased manifold in the last decades, decimating the natural distribution of the plant dramatically. It is therefore now listed as rare and critically endangered in many of its habitats. Some of these habitats are designated as protected areas or national parks, but that has not safeguarded the plant from opportunistic gathering. Considering the entirety of C. fenestratum's range, not enough field data is available as of 2015 for any reliable assessment of its global status in the IUCN Red List. Locally however, IUCN has categorized C. fenestratum as follows: * India: Critically endangered (1997, 2010, 2016) * Sri Lanka: Indiscriminate (1997, 2015) * Vietnam: Vulnerable (since 1997) * Cambodia, Vietnam and west Malaysia: Data deficient (2015) The Indian and Sri Lankan populations of C. fenestratum are probably the most disturbed and severely affected. Over a 75 year period (three generations for this species), the plant population has been reduced by 80% due to indiscriminate gathering by local people. Hardly any mature plants are left in the wild. Experiments with cultivating Coscinium fenestratum, instead of harvesting the plant in its natural environment, is carried out at present.  Trade and regulations  , an estimated of raw material from C. fenestratum is traded each year in India (Ved and Goraya 2008). It is illegal to export C. fenestratum from India. In some areas, like Cambodia and Laos for instance, C. fenestratum is harvested on a large scale and subsequently processed with toxic acids, posing a pollution threat to the local eco- systems. It is unclear who buys the yellow vine extractions, and for what purpose they are used. In Cambodia, hazardous processing like these are illegal since 2002 and since 2006 it has also been illegal to export both yellow vine and \\"yellow vine powder\\".

For every item sold, a headband is donated to a child battling cancer. Since launching in 2012, Headbands of Hope has donated over 285,000 headbands to every hospital across the United States and in thirteen countries. Headbands of Hope is carried in thousands of stores across the world. They've been featured on the TODAY Show, Good Morning America, Vanity Fair, Seventeen Magazine, and even supported by celebrities like Lea Michele, Lauren Conrad, Kelsea Ballerini, Lili Reinhart and more. Headbands of Hope is a for-profit organization. .  History  Headbands of Hope was envisioned by Ekstrom after an internship at the Make-A-Wish Foundation in 2011. Noticing that many girls who received treatment preferred wearing headbands instead of wigs, Ekstrom began to work distributing headbands to them. The organization launched in April 2012. By January 31, 2013, the organization had donated more than 3,000 headbands. The style of delivery, sending the headbands to hospitals rather than individual patients, was taken from TOMS Shoes, a supporter of the organization. Other products include shirts and bumper stickers. Production The headbands, made in a variety of shapes and sizes, are mostly adjustable. They are tagged and branded in their warehouse in Cornelius, North Carolina. Ekstrom chose the company with help from the College of Design and the College of Textiles at North Carolina State University, where she graduated. Styles are determined by Ekstrom and her team of designers, who look at popular trends . Outside the United States, production has extended to Canada and is distribution is planned to expand in Peru in 2014. Marketing The headbands are marketed by representatives on college campuses. By January 2013, there were over 20 representatives The \\"Hope Club,\\" allows cancer patients who have received headbands to post photos and biographies. The enterprise has received recognition from both NBC's Today Show and Fitness Magazine. Recently, the organization has started marketing more general headwear through Headwear of Hope, donating headwear to young boys undergoing cancer treatment.

Prior to their move in early 2018, The Center for Fiction was located at 17 East 47th Street, between Madison and Fifth Avenues in Midtown Manhattan. The Center works to promote fiction and literature and to give support to writers. It originated in 1820 as the (New York) Mercantile Library and in 2005 changed its name to the Mercantile Library Center for Fiction, although it presents itself as simply \\"The Center for Fiction\\". The Center, which is one of 17 remaining membership libraries in the United States, three of which are in New York City, maintains a large circulating library of 20th and 21st century fiction, in addition to many stored volumes of 19th century fiction. It also stocks non-fiction volumes on subjects related to literature. It maintains a Reading Room, operates a curated independent bookstore primarily featuring works of fiction, rents space to writers at low cost, and presents literary programs to the public. The organization also awards the annual Center for Fiction First Novel Prize. Mercantile Library=1820‚Äì1853 From the New York Commercial Advertiser (November 2, 1820) The foundation of the Mercantile Library Association was instigated by the New York Chamber of Commerce, which placed newspaper advertisements in November 1820 asking merchant clerks to meet at a local coffee house to discuss forming an organization based on the Mercantile Library in Boston, which had been created earlier that year. The purpose of the new organization was to provide the city's growing population of clerks with an alternative to what were considered to be immoral entertainments and other vices of the city. The Association's first subscription circulating library, which had 700 volumes in rented rooms at 49 Fulton Street in Manhattan, was open to most of the general public, but only merchant clerks were allowed to vote for and be officers in the Association. By the year 1826, the financial \\"prospects brightened to the extent that the officers hired a suite of rooms in the Harpers building on Cliff Street, and starting the reading room, which has continued to be an important part of the institution in all its successive homes.‚Äù In 1830, the library moved to a new building designed by architect Seth Geer, called Clinton Hall, at Nassau and Beekman Streets, which the Clinton Hall Association, made up of prominent members of the Mercantile Library Association, had raised funds to construct. Frequent lectures were presented by the library, including by Ralph Waldo Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.. By 1844 the library contained works of agriculture and gardening; amusements, games, sports &c; anecdotes, facetiae, table talk &c; Anglo Saxon language &c; antiquities, heraldry, mythology, and numismatics; architecture; arts and sciences; astronomy; banking and currency; bibliography and typography; biography; book keeping; botany; chemistry; commerce; conchology; dictionaries and lexicons; domestic economy; dramatic literature; education; electricity and magnetism; essays and literary miscellanies; fine arts; geography; geology and mineralogy; history; language; law; letters; mathematics; medicine; metaphysics; miscellaneous works; moral science; music; natural history; natural philosophy; novels; novels in foreign languages; orations, speeches and addresses; periodicals; phrenology; poetry; political economy; political science; religion; rhetoric, oratory and criticism; Shakspeare; slavery; voyages and travels; Africa, America, Asia, China, Egypt, England, Europe, France, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, London, Rome, Russia, Scandinavia, Scotland, Spain and Portugal, Switzerland. Among its newspaper subscriptions in 1844 were the Churchman, Evening Post, Examiner, Journal of Commerce, Morning Courier, New York American, New York Commercial Advertiser, New York Evangelist, New York Observer, New York Tribune, Niles Weekly Register, and Noticioso de Ambos Mundos. Among the library's magazine subscriptions in 1844 were: Ainsworth's Magazine, American Journal of Science and the Arts, American Phrenological Journal, American Rail Road Journal, Annals and Magazine of Natural History, Athenaeum, Bentley's Miscellany, Blackwood's Magazine, British and Foreign Review, Chambers's Edinburgh Journal, Chemical Gazette, Christian Examiner, Dublin University Magazine, Eclectic Museum of Foreign Literature, Eclectic Review, Edinburgh Review, Foreign Quarterly Review, Franklin Institute's Journal, Frazer's Magazine, Gardener's Magazine, Gentleman's Magazine, Graham's Magazine, Knickerbocker, Ladies Companion, Mechanic's Magazine, Merchants Magazine, Metropolitan Magazine, Mirror, Nautical Magazine, New Monthly Magazine, Penny Magazine, Philosophical Magazine, Phrenological Journal, Quarterly Review, Repertory of Patent Inventions, Sailor's Magazine, Southern Literary Messenger, Tait's Edinburgh Magazine, United Service Journal, United States Magazine and Democratic Review, and Westminster Review.

The opera house had closed its doors as a result of the Astor Place riot of 1849, and the building was sold for $140,000 to the Association, which renamed it \\"Clinton Hall\\" and moved the library there as a place which was more convenient to its members. At its new location, the Association offered classes and public lectures, including by Frederick Douglass, William Thackeray, and Mark Twain, and functioned as a cultural center. Membership during this period reached at least 12,000, while the library itself amassed 120,000 volumes, making it the largest circulating library in the United States at the time.Pascu By 1872 the library contained works of biography; history, geography and travels; literature; mathematics; medical science; mental and moral science; natural sciences; political science; the arts; and theology. However, because the library did not stay open late at night, its services were not generally available to the working class, a deficit which was remedied when the Cooper Union opened a block east on Astor Place: its reading room was open until 10 p.m.Burrows & Wallace, p.782 In 1891, requiring more space, the Association tore down the opera house and replaced it with an 11-story building designed by George E. Harney, which it also named \\"Clinton Hall\\". The new building featured a reading room on the top floor that was two stories high, and was to remain the headquarters for its library operations, which included 7 branches, until 1920, when it relocated to rented space. However, in 1932, the library once again had its own building, at 17 East 47th Street, designed by Henry Otis Chapman. Here, the Association maintained its 230,000 volumes to serve 3,000 subscribers. The library at this time still had branches at 149 Broadway at Liberty Street and 598 Madison Avenue at 57th Street. 1970s‚Äì2000s Membership in the library declined through the following decades, and the library sold off parts of its collection in the 1970s. \\"In 1971 the theological collection was sold, in 1977 the foreign language collection was sold.\\" It also attempted a merger with Pace College, but this did not occur. By 1987 the library was in financial distress, and closed for the summer of 1987, and then indefinitely in 1989, at a time when its membership was only 375 people. The Association subsequently reorganized and reopened, with a new focus on fiction and literature. In 1998, the ground floor of the building was renovated by Beyer Blinder Belle. The library ‚Äì colloquially known as \\"The Merc\\" ‚Äì had considered moving to a new location in 2008, but subsequently decided to remain at its historic Midtown Manhattan location. Center for Fiction, 2005‚Äìpresent Since 2005 known as The Center for Fiction, the organization presents a diverse program of free or low-cost public events, featuring over 100 authors, translators, and critics each year. The Center also offers reading groups and writing workshops, open to the public, led by writers and scholars. In May 2018, the organization announced that it would be moving its headquarters to a new building in Downtown Brooklyn called Caesura and designed by Dattner Architects, a The space includes a library, classrooms, a writers studio, an auditorium for 160 people, a bookstore and a cafe. The three-story building will be co-owned with the Mark Morris Dance Group and a real estate company, which will have their own spaces there.

It is an improvement over the algorithm of Sipser and Spielman. Zemor considered a typical class of Sipser‚ÄìSpielman construction of expander codes, where the underlying graph is bipartite graph. Sipser and Spielman introduced a constructive family of asymptotically good linear-error codes together with a simple parallel algorithm that will always remove a constant fraction of errors. The article is based on Dr. Venkatesan Guruswami's course notes http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse590vg/03wi/scribes/1-27.ps  Code construction  Zemor's algorithm is based on a type of expander graphs called Tanner graph. The construction of code was first proposed by Tanner.http://www.cs.washington.edu/education/courses/cse533/06au/lecnotes/lecture14.pdf The codes are based on double cover d, regular expander G, which is a bipartite graph. G = \\\\left(V,E\\\\right), where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges and V = A \\\\cup B and A \\\\cap B = \\\\emptyset, where A and B denotes the set of 2 vertices. Let n be the number of vertices in each group, i.e, A =B =n. The edge set E be of size N =nd and every edge in E has one endpoint in both A and B. E(v) denotes the set of edges containing v. Assume an ordering on V, therefore ordering will be done on every edges of E(v) for every v \\\\in V. Let finite field \\\\mathbb{F}=GF(2), and for a word x=(x_e), e\\\\in E in \\\\mathbb{F}^N, let the subword of the word will be indexed by E(v). Let that word be denoted by (x)_v. The subset of vertices A and B induces every word x\\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}^N a partition into n non-overlapping sub-words \\\\left(x\\\\right)_v\\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}^d, where v ranges over the elements of A. For constructing a code C, consider a linear subcode C_o, which is a [d,r_od,\\\\delta] code, where q, the size of the alphabet is 2. For any vertex v \\\\in V, let v(1), v(2),\\\\ldots,v(d) be some ordering of the d vertices of E adjacent to v. In this code, each bit x_e is linked with an edge e of E. We can define the code C to be the set of binary vectors x = \\\\left( x_1,x_2,\\\\ldots,x_N \\\\right) of {0,1}^N such that, for every vertex v of V, \\\\left(x_{v(1)}, x_{v(2)},\\\\ldots, x_{v(d)}\\\\right) is a code word of C_o. In this case, we can consider a special case when every edge of E is adjacent to exactly 2 vertices of V. It means that V and E make up, respectively, the vertex set and edge set of d regular graph G. Let us call the code C constructed in this way as \\\\left(G,C_o\\\\right) code. For a given graph G and a given code C_o, there are several \\\\left(G,C_o\\\\right) codes as there are different ways of ordering edges incident to a given vertex v, i.e., v(1), v(2),\\\\ldots,v(d) . In fact our code C consist of all codewords such that x_v\\\\in C_o for all v \\\\in A, B. The code C is linear [N,K,D] in \\\\mathbb{F} as it is generated from a subcode C_o, which is linear. The code C is defined as C={c\\\\in \\\\mathbb{F}^N :(c)_v \\\\in C_o} for every v\\\\in V. Graph G and code C In this figure, (x)_v =\\\\left(x_{e1}, x_{e2}, x_{e3}, x_{e4}\\\\right)\\\\in C_o. It shows the graph G and code C. In matrix G, let \\\\lambda is equal to the second largest eigen value of adjacency matrix of G. Here the largest eigen value is d. Two important claims are made:  Claim 1  \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{K}{N}\\\\right)\\\\geq 2r_o-1 . Let R be the rate of a linear code constructed from a bipartite graph whose digit nodes have degree m and whose subcode nodes have degree n. If a single linear code with parameters \\\\left(n,k\\\\right) and rate r = \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{k}{n}\\\\right) is associated with each of the subcode nodes, then k\\\\geq 1-\\\\left(1-r\\\\right)m. = Proof = Let R be the rate of the linear code, which is equal to K/N Let there are S subcode nodes in the graph. If the degree of the subcode is n, then the code must have \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{n}{m}\\\\right) S digits, as each digit node is connected to m of the \\\\left(n\\\\right)S edges in the graph. Each subcode node contributes (n-k) equations to parity check matrix for a total of \\\\left(n-k\\\\right) S. These equations may not be linearly independent. Therefore, \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{K}{N}\\\\right)\\\\geq \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{(\\\\dfrac{n}{m})S - (n-k)S}{(\\\\dfrac{n}{m}) S}\\\\right) \\\\geq 1-m\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{n-k}{n}\\\\right) \\\\geq 1-m \\\\left(1-r\\\\right) , Since the value of m, i.e., the digit node of this bipartite graph is 2 and here r = r_o, we can write as: \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{K}{N}\\\\right)\\\\geq 2r_o -1  Claim 2  : D\\\\geq N\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{(\\\\delta-(\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d}))}{(1-(\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d})})\\\\right)^2 : =N\\\\left(\\\\delta^2- O\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d}\\\\right)\\\\right) \\\\rightarrow (1) If S is linear code of rate r, block code length d, and minimum relative distance \\\\delta, and if B is the edge vertex incidence graph of a d ‚Äì regular graph with second largest eigen value \\\\lambda, then the code C(B,S) has rate at least 2r_o -1 and minimum relative distance at least \\\\left(\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\delta- \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d}\\\\right)}{1-\\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d}\\\\right)}\\\\right)\\\\right)^2. = Proof = Let B be derived from the d regular graph G. So, the number of variables of C(B,S) is \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{dn}{2}\\\\right) and the number of constraints is n. According to Alon - Chung,http://math.ucsd.edu/~fan/mypaps/fanpap/93tolerant.pdf if X is a subset of vertices of G of size \\\\gamma n, then the number of edges contained in the subgraph is induced by X in G is at most \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{dn}{2}\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\gamma^2 + (\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d})\\\\gamma \\\\left(1-\\\\gamma\\\\right)\\\\right). As a result, any set of \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{dn}{2}\\\\right) \\\\left(\\\\gamma^2 + \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d}\\\\right)\\\\gamma \\\\left(1-\\\\gamma\\\\right)\\\\right) variables will be having at least \\\\gamma n constraints as neighbours. So the average number of variables per constraint is : \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{(\\\\dfrac{2nd}{2}) \\\\left(\\\\gamma^2 + (\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d})\\\\gamma \\\\left(1-\\\\gamma\\\\right)\\\\right)}{\\\\gamma n}\\\\right) = d\\\\left( \\\\gamma + (\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d}) \\\\left( 1-\\\\gamma\\\\right)\\\\right) \\\\rightarrow (2) So if d\\\\left( \\\\gamma + (\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d}) \\\\left( 1-\\\\gamma\\\\right)\\\\right) < \\\\gamma d, then a word of relative weight \\\\left(\\\\gamma^2 + (\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d})\\\\gamma \\\\left(1-\\\\gamma\\\\right)\\\\right), cannot be a codeword of C(B,S). The inequality (2) is satisfied for \\\\gamma < \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{1-(\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d})}{\\\\delta-(\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d})}\\\\right). Therefore, C(B,S) cannot have a non zero codeword of relative weight \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{\\\\delta-(\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d})}{1-(\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d})}\\\\right)^2 or less. In matrix G, we can assume that \\\\lambda/d is bounded away from 1. For those values of d in which d-1 is odd prime, there are explicit constructions of sequences of d \\\\- regular bipartite graphs with arbitrarily large number of vertices such that each graph G in the sequence is a Ramanujan graph. It is called Ramanujan graph as it satisfies the inequality \\\\lambda(G) \\\\leq 2\\\\sqrt{d-1}. Certain expansion properties are visible in graph G as the separation between the eigen values d and \\\\lambda . If the graph G is Ramanujan graph, then that expression (1) will become 0 eventually as d becomes large.  Zemor's algorithm  The iterative decoding algorithm written below alternates between the vertices A and B in G and corrects the codeword of C_o in A and then it switches to correct the codeword C_o in B. Here edges associated with a vertex on one side of a graph are not incident to other vertex on that side. In fact, it doesn't matter in which order, the set of nodes A and B are processed. The vertex processing can also be done in parallel. The decoder \\\\mathbb{D}:\\\\mathbb{F}^d \\\\rightarrow C_ostands for a decoder for C_o that recovers correctly with any codewords with less than \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{d}{2}\\\\right) errors.  Decoder algorithm  Received word : w=(w_e), e\\\\in E \` z \\\\leftarrow w For t \\\\leftarrow 1 to m do //m is the number of iterations { if (t is odd) // Here the algorithm will alternate between its two vertex sets. X \\\\leftarrow A else X \\\\leftarrow B Iteration t: For every v \\\\in X, let (z)_v \\\\leftarrow \\\\mathbb{D}((z)_v) // Decoding z_v to its nearest codeword. } \` Output: z  Explanation of the algorithm  Since G is bipartite, the set A of vertices induces the partition of the edge set E = \\\\cup_{v\\\\in A} E_v . The set B induces another partition, E = \\\\cup_{v\\\\in B} E_v . Let w \\\\in {0,1}^N be the received vector, and recall that N=dn. The first iteration of the algorithm consists of applying the complete decoding for the code induced by E_v for every v \\\\in A . This means that for replacing, for every v \\\\in A, the vector \\\\left( w_{v(1)}, w_{v(2)}, \\\\ldots, w_{v(d)}\\\\right) by one of the closest codewords of C_o. Since the subsets of edges E_v are disjoint for v \\\\in A, the decoding of these n subvectors of w may be done in parallel. The iteration will yield a new vector z. The next iteration consists of applying the preceding procedure to z but with A replaced by B. In other words, it consists of decoding all the subvectors induced by the vertices of B. The coming iterations repeat those two steps alternately applying parallel decoding to the subvectors induced by the vertices of A and to the subvectors induced by the vertices of B. Note: [If d=n and G is the complete bipartite graph, then C is a product code of C_o with itself and the above algorithm reduces to the natural hard iterative decoding of product codes]. Here, the number of iterations, m is \\\\left(\\\\dfrac{(\\\\log{n})}{\\\\log(2-\\\\alpha)}\\\\right). In general, the above algorithm can correct a code word whose Hamming weight is no more than (\\\\dfrac{1}{2}).\\\\alpha N \\\\delta \\\\left((\\\\dfrac{\\\\delta}{2})-(\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d})\\\\right) =\\\\left((\\\\dfrac{1}{4}).\\\\alpha N (\\\\delta^2- O(\\\\dfrac{\\\\lambda}{d})\\\\right) for values of \\\\alpha < 1. Here, the decoding algorithm is implemented as a circuit of size O(N \\\\log{N} ) and depth O(\\\\log{N}) that returns the codeword given that error vector has weight less than \\\\alpha N \\\\delta^2 (1-\\\\epsilon)/4 .  Theorem  If G is a Ramanujan graph of sufficiently high degree, for any \\\\alpha < 1, the decoding algorithm can correct (\\\\dfrac{\\\\alpha \\\\delta_o^2}{4})(1-\\\\in) N errors, in O(\\\\log {n}) rounds ( where the big- O notation hides a dependence on \\\\alpha). This can be implemented in linear time on a single processor; on n processors each round can be implemented in constant time. = Proof = Since the decoding algorithm is insensitive to the value of the edges and by linearity, we can assume that the transmitted codeword is the all zeros - vector. Let the received codeword be w. The set of edges which has an incorrect value while decoding is considered. Here by incorrect value, we mean 1 in any of the bits. Let w=w^0 be the initial value of the codeword, w^1, w^2,\\\\ldots, w^t be the values after first, second . . . t stages of decoding. Here, X^i={e\\\\in Ex_e^i =1}, and S^i ={v\\\\in V^i  E_v \\\\cap X^{i+1} !=\\\\emptyset}. Here S^i corresponds to those set of vertices that was not able to successfully decode their codeword in the i^{th} round. From the above algorithm S^1 as number of unsuccessful vertices will be corrected in every iteration. We can prove that S^0>S^1>S^2>\\\\cdotsis a decreasing sequence. In fact, S_{i+1}<=(\\\\dfrac{1}{2-\\\\alpha})S_i. As we are assuming, \\\\alpha<1, the above equation is in a geometric decreasing sequence. So, when S_i, more than log_{2-\\\\alpha} n rounds are necessary. Furthermore, \\\\sumS_i=n\\\\sum(\\\\dfrac{1}{(2-\\\\alpha)^i})=O(n), and if we implement the i^{th} round in O(S_i) time, then the total sequential running time will be linear.  Drawbacks of Zemor's algorithm  # It is lengthy process as the number of iterations m in decoder algorithm takes is [(\\\\log{ n})/(\\\\log(2-\\\\alpha))] # Zemor's decoding algorithm finds it difficult to decode erasures. A detailed way of how we can improve the algorithm is given in.

Dolan is also the \\"control person\\" for the team. Early life Dolan was born and raised in the Cleveland, Ohio suburb of Chardon, as one of six children of Larry and Eva Dolan. Dolan attended high school at the Gilmour Academy in Gates Mills, Ohio, and upon graduation attended college at St. Lawrence University, and upon graduation went on to earn his law degree at Notre Dame Law School in 1983. Career After graduating from law school, Dolan was hired as an attorney for his father's law firm (Thrasher, Dinsmore, and Dolan), eventually becoming a partner in 1992. In 2000, Larry Dolan purchased the Cleveland Indians baseball team. Upon his father taking control of the team, Dolan was hired as a vice president and general counsel. In 2004, Dolan was promoted to team president, and in 2011 promoted again to chairman/CEO. In 2013, Dolan was approved by the team owners of MLB as the \\"control person\\" of the Indians; the Associated Press describes this new role as \\"controlling owner\\". This new designation means that Dolan oversees the day to day team operations, and is responsible for compliance with MLB rules and regulations. Though officially listed as Chairman/CEO by the team, Dolan is sometimes referred to as an owner of the Indians, as the team is considered to be a family asset due to being purchased through various Dolan Family trusts. Family Dolan's son Peter was selected by the Indians in the 33rd round of the 2014 MLB Draft as a third baseman out of Gilmour Academy.

The episode aired on CBS on September 27, 1977 and is the first episode where the character of Frank Burns does not play a part in (although Larry Linville, the actor who played Burns, left the series at the end of the fifth season, the character was used in \\"Fade Out, Fade In\\", where an unseen and unheard Frank was making a phone call to Col. Sherman Potter). Plot Radar O'Reilly is feeling down as he does not believe that he is a \\"hot lover\\" and wants to try to become one so he can attract the various nurses of the 4077th. He relays his concerns to Hawkeye Pierce and B.J. Hunnicutt in The Swamp, and Hawkeye suggests that Radar take a trip to Seoul and try to find a woman there. Radar initially does not want to, but Hawkeye keeps prodding him until he finally agrees. After getting approval, Radar leaves on a Jeep. Later that day, the 4077th is once again inundated with wounded as it usually is. While performing triage outside the OR, Hawkeye is examining a wounded soldier's shoulder and turns him over to look at his chest. Suddenly, he realizes that the wounded soldier is Radar and calls B.J. over to help him. Hawkeye is instantly taken aback by what has happened to Radar and believes it that it is his fault that Radar is injured, saying that he sent Radar out into the middle of the fighting \\"on a date.\\" After insisting on performing the surgery to save Radar, Hawkeye heads out to drink his guilt away but cannot as all he can talk about is how guilty he feels. The next morning Hawkeye wakes up suffering from a hangover worse than he usually suffers from when drinking and is in no condition to operate. However, wounded arrive in the compound and Major Winchester insists that Hawkeye rise from his bed and perform his duties as chief surgeon over B.J.'s protests that Hawkeye be allowed to rest. Winchester says that the call was for \\"all personnel\\", which by definition includes Hawkeye, and that he should not be excused because of his condition. Once Colonel Potter discovers Hawkeye's condition he is not pleased, and things get worse when Hawkeye has to run out of the OR to vomit during an operation and Winchester has to finish. After the session is done Potter lectures Hawkeye on his behavior, telling him that he relies on him in the operating room and that his conduct was as unprofessional as it has ever been. Hawkeye, still upset, promises not to do it again and leaves while many people suggest he go visit Radar in post-op. Although he does not want to, as he is ashamed of his conduct and still has not gotten rid of the guilt over Radar's injury, Hawkeye finally does go to see him. Radar, however, is not happy to see him at all and abruptly calls him \\"sir\\" when asking when he will be ready to go back to work. Surprised that Radar was so formal in speaking to him, since he almost always referred to Hawkeye by his name, Hawkeye asks him why. Radar then tells Hawkeye that he heard what happened in the OR. Hawkeye explains why it happened and that he had been under stress. Radar dismisses his concerns, and again calls Hawkeye out for having to leave, saying that he let a lot of people down. Hawkeye, meanwhile, is growing more tense as the conversation continues and feels that Radar is holding him to a much higher standard of conduct than he would anyone else because of his position. When he tries to explain that he would have substituted for Winchester if something happened to him, Radar says that Hawkeye is admired and depended upon by most of the staff and to have entered the room as intoxicated as he was, he is sending the message that there is nothing to depend on. Hawkeye then says to Radar: After briefly attempting to leave the room, all of Hawkeye's anger and frustration finally boils over and he turns back to Radar, standing over him and dressing him down in front of the whole post-op ward: After being subjected to the diatribe from the chief surgeon, Radar is reduced to tears. Hawkeye is snapped out of his rage by his surprise at Radar's crying and asks him to stop twice, the second time in a more desperate, pleading manner, before calling him a \\"ninny\\" and running out of the ward. Heading back to the Swamp, Hawkeye tells B.J. what happened and that he could not believe what he was doing, saying that he was not being himself and that his overflowing frustration caused him to be \\"an angry man screaming at Radar\\". Shortly thereafter Father Mulcahy enters The Swamp, having just heard the news; the uncharacteristically infuriated Father yells at Hawkeye for his actions, not believing that he was ever capable of making Radar cry. Mulcahy is in fact so angry at Hawkeye that he takes his frustration out by kicking the stove in The Swamp, which only makes him feel worse as he walks away with a broken toe. As if that were not enough, a furious Col. Potter comes by next, now unhappy that he has had to discipline Hawkeye twice in one day.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0638304/trivia?tab=qt&ref;_=tt_trv_qu While Potter has his say, Margaret Houlihan enters The Swamp to make her feelings known, but she is so angry that she keeps interrupting Potter, which frustrates him as he was not planning on having to share his anger with her. Hawkeye eventually decides to apologize to Radar, who refuses to accept. Still remembering what Hawkeye said to him, Radar decides to give Hawkeye a taste of his own medicine. Later, Potter checks in on Radar and tries to broker a peace between his feuding comrades but Radar is unwilling at first. Later that night in Rosie's Bar, Hawkeye and Radar start to shoot the breeze before Hawkeye apologizes to Radar for his conduct and says that it is okay if he still wants to worship him as a hero. Radar says he would \\"just as soon not\\", but eventually the two make peace by trading drinks as Radar takes Hawkeye's beer while Hawkeye drinks Radar's Grape Nehi. The episode closes with another unusually formal event involving Radar and Hawkeye. The Army has decided to award Radar the Purple Heart due to his injury, and Hawkeye presents it to him. After pinning in on him, Hawkeye gives a salute to the company clerk, something he rarely does and jokingly tells him not to get hurt again. Notes *Although David Ogden Stiers officially became part of the cast at the beginning of the season, this is the first episode that his character of Charles Emerson Winchester III has been a full member of the 4077th; in \\"Fade Out, Fade In\\" he began the episode as a surgeon at Tokyo General Hospital. *Hawkeye's presentation of the Purple Heart to Radar was later referenced in the episode \\"Good-Bye, Radar\\" which aired during season 8. While he is packing to go home, Radar finds the Purple Heart among his belongings and tells Klinger, his replacement as company clerk, that Hawkeye pinned it to him himself and that Hawkeye saluted him, saying \\"Hawkeye never salutes anybody.\\" References Category:M*A*S*H (season 6) episodes Category:1977 American television episodes Category:Television programs directed by Alan Alda ","title":"Fallen Idol (M*A*S*H)"},{"id":"41918678","text":"Siphonogorgia is a genus of soft corals in the family Nidaliidae.

In mid November 2013, it was reported that the film would start its shoot from 1 December 2013 and Naga Chaitanya would shoot simultaneously for this film along with his other projects Autonagar Surya and Manam. However it didn't commence then and on 6 February 2014 the film was officially launched at Hyderabad along with Venkatesh's political drama Raadha under the direction of Maruthi Dasari and Ram Charan's Govindudu Andarivadele under the direction of Krishna Vamsi. These three were launched on the eve of Radha Saptami which became a noticeable news. The film was titled Durga on the day of the launch and the cast and crew were specified on the same day. Vijay C. Kumar and S. Thaman were announced as the Cinematographer and Music Director of the film while Srinivasa Reddy was announced to handle the screenplay of the film apart from directing it. The filming was said to be commenced from 24 February 2014 and would shoot continuously till July 2014 and would be released on the eve of Ramzan. On the day of the launch, the poster bearing the logo of the title was launched which was designed by Kiran Poster Ads, a reputed poster designer company in Tollywood. The filming started on 25 February 2014 in and around Hyderabad. However, in mid March 2014, due to differences between Naga Chaitanya and Srinivasa Reddy, it was reported that the film was shelved indefinitely. However, it was also reported that the film will start its principal photography once the director is replaced with other one and it was also said that Akula Siva may handle the direction.

Yoga emphasises regular practice (Abhyasa) meditation and self-imposed discipline to acquire ekagrata. Overview The faculty called EkƒÅgratƒÅ may be increased by integrating the psycho-mental flux (sarvƒÅrthatƒÅ or variously-directed, discontinuous, and diffuse attention) so that one gains genuine will and a happiness different from the experience of pleasure from sense-objects. It is harder to achieve if the body is in a tiring or uncomfortable posture or if the breathing is improper. Austerity (tapas) is allied to this conception of ekagrata Badarayana's Brahma Sutras (chapter 3) uses the term to mean concentration: it is held to be a quality resulting from practices discussed in the previous chapter, which are briefly mentioned in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and Chandogya Upanishad. According to the Bhagavad Gita the seeker after Truth should meditate with his mind fixed on the Lord (machchittƒÅh) and absorbed in Him (matparƒÅh). This is ekagrata. The term nityayuktƒÅh refers to devotees who keep their mind fixed on God uninterruptedly. Patanjali highlights the importance of continuous practice of prescribed methods to gain ekagrata, the state of the meditative mind free of diverted attention etc.; and thereafter explains that:- :‡§§‡§§‡§É ‡§™‡•Å‡§®‡§É‡§∂‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ã‡§¶‡§ø‡§§‡•å ‡§§‡•Å‡§≤‡•ç‡§Ø‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Ø‡•å ‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§§‡§∏‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à‡§ï‡§æ‡§ó‡•ç‡§∞‡§§‡§æ‡§™‡§∞‡§ø‡§£‡§æ‡§Æ‡§É  - Yoga Sutra III.12 intentness on a single point (ekagrata) of the thinking principle (citta) gives rise to equilibrium of placid states (previously accumulated impressions) and aroused states (present eagerness to gain more knowledge), which are modifications (of the mind). These two states of mind remain unchanged and are brought to the state of stillness. Ekagrata and dharana do not differ from each other, or else dharana is achieving and maintaining ekagrata. Dharana converges on a particular concept or object. In the state of ekagrata there is clarity and right direction: yoga begins with ekagrata and culminates in nirodha, a consciousness free of movement. Dharana gives the ability to see one‚Äôs own mind, one starts looking inwards deeply. If ekagrata is lost the full power of intention to achieve goals to be achieved is lost. Intentions afflicted by doubts, fears and reactive thoughts break and diffuse the energy of intentions. The mind which is the cause of Sankalpa ('notion')-Vikalpa ('alternative') must be controlled, it must be bound. Ekagrata assists in keeping one‚Äôs own mind bound and still.

Originally, shearlets were introduced in 2006 for the analysis and sparse approximation of functions f \\\\in L^2(\\\\R^2). They are a natural extension of wavelets, to accommodate the fact that multivariate functions are typically governed by anisotropic features such as edges in images, since wavelets, as isotropic objects, are not capable of capturing such phenomena. Shearlets are constructed by parabolic scaling, shearing, and translation applied to a few generating functions. At fine scales, they are essentially supported within skinny and directional ridges following the parabolic scaling law, which reads length¬≤ ‚âà width. Similar to wavelets, shearlets arise from the affine group and allow a unified treatment of the continuum and digital situation leading to faithful implementations. Although they do not constitute an orthonormal basis for L^2(\\\\R^2), they still form a frame allowing stable expansions of arbitrary functions f \\\\in L^2(\\\\R^2). One of the most important properties of shearlets is their ability to provide optimally sparse approximations (in the sense of optimality in ) for cartoon-like functions f. In imaging sciences, cartoon-like functions serve as a model for anisotropic features and are compactly supported in [0,1]^2 while being C^2 apart from a closed piecewise C^2 singularity curve with bounded curvature. The decay rate of the L^2-error of the N-term shearlet approximation obtained by taking the N largest coefficients from the shearlet expansion is in fact optimal up to a log-factor: :\\\\ f - f_N \\\\_{L^2}^2 \\\\leq C N^{-2} (\\\\log N)^3, \\\\quad N \\\\to \\\\infty, where the constant C depends only on the maximum curvature of the singularity curve and the maximum magnitudes of f, f^{'} and f^{}. This approximation rate significantly improves the best N-term approximation rate of wavelets providing only O(N^{-1}) for such class of functions. Shearlets are to date the only directional representation system that provides sparse approximation of anisotropic features while providing a unified treatment of the continuum and digital realm that allows faithful implementation. Extensions of shearlet systems to L^2(\\\\R^d), d \\\\ge 2 are also available. A comprehensive presentation of the theory and applications of shearlets can be found in.  Definition = Continuous shearlet systems  The construction of continuous shearlet systems is based on parabolic scaling matrices : A_a = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a & 0 \\\\ 0 & a^{1/2} \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\quad a > 0 as a mean to change the resolution, on shear matrices : S_s = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & s \\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\quad s \\\\in \\\\R as a means to change the orientation, and finally on translations to change the positioning. In comparison to curvelets, shearlets use shearings instead of rotations, the advantage being that the shear operator S_s leaves the integer lattice invariant in case s \\\\in \\\\Z, i.e., S_s \\\\Z^2 \\\\subseteq \\\\Z^2. This indeed allows a unified treatment of the continuum and digital realm, thereby guaranteeing a faithful digital implementation. For \\\\psi \\\\in L^2(\\\\R^2) the continuous shearlet system generated by \\\\psi is then defined as : \\\\operatorname{SH}_{\\\\mathrm{cont}}(\\\\psi) = { \\\\psi_{a,s,t} = a^{3/4} \\\\psi(S_s A_a (\\\\cdot - t)) \\\\mid a > 0, s \\\\in \\\\R, t \\\\in \\\\R^2 }, and the corresponding continuous shearlet transform is given by the map : f \\\\mapsto \\\\mathcal{SH}_\\\\psi f(a, s, t) = \\\\langle f, \\\\psi_{a,s,t} \\\\rangle, \\\\quad f \\\\in L^2(\\\\R^2), \\\\quad (a, s, t) \\\\in \\\\R_{>0} \\\\times \\\\R \\\\times \\\\R^2.  Discrete shearlet systems  A discrete version of shearlet systems can be directly obtained from \\\\operatorname{SH}_{\\\\mathrm{cont}}(\\\\psi) by discretizing the parameter set \\\\R_{>0} \\\\times \\\\R \\\\times \\\\R^2. There are numerous approaches for this but the most popular one is given by : { (2^j, k, A_{2^j}^{-1} S_k^{-1} m) \\\\mid j \\\\in \\\\Z, k \\\\in \\\\Z, m \\\\in \\\\Z^2} \\\\subseteq \\\\R_{>0} \\\\times \\\\R \\\\times \\\\R^2. From this, the discrete shearlet system associated with the shearlet generator \\\\psi is defined by : \\\\operatorname{SH}(\\\\psi) = { \\\\psi_{j,k,m} = 2^{3j/4} \\\\psi(S_k A_{2^j} \\\\cdot{} - m) \\\\mid j \\\\in \\\\Z, k \\\\in \\\\Z, m \\\\in \\\\Z^2 }, and the associated discrete shearlet transform is defined by : f \\\\mapsto \\\\mathcal{SH}_\\\\psi f(j, k, m) = \\\\langle f, \\\\psi_{j,k,m} \\\\rangle, \\\\quad f \\\\in L^2(\\\\R^2), \\\\quad (j, k, m) \\\\in \\\\Z \\\\times \\\\Z \\\\times \\\\Z^2.  Examples  Let \\\\psi_1 \\\\in L^2(\\\\R) be a function satisfying the discrete Calder√≥n condition, i.e., :\\\\sum_{j \\\\in \\\\Z} \\\\hat\\\\psi_1(2^{-j} \\\\xi)^2 = 1, \\\\quad \\\\xi \\\\in \\\\R, with \\\\hat\\\\psi_1 \\\\in C^\\\\infty(\\\\R) and \\\\operatorname{supp}\\\\hat\\\\psi_1 \\\\subseteq [-\\\\tfrac{1}{2}, -\\\\tfrac{1}{16}] \\\\cup [\\\\tfrac{1}{16}, \\\\tfrac{1}{2}], where \\\\hat\\\\psi_1 denotes the Fourier transform of \\\\psi_1. For instance, one can choose \\\\psi_1 to be a Meyer wavelet. Furthermore, let \\\\psi_2 \\\\in L^2(\\\\R) be such that \\\\hat\\\\psi_2 \\\\in C^\\\\infty(\\\\R), \\\\operatorname{supp}\\\\hat\\\\psi_2 \\\\subseteq [-1, 1] and :\\\\sum_{k \\\\in Z} \\\\hat\\\\psi_2(\\\\xi + k)^2 = 1, \\\\quad \\\\xi \\\\in \\\\R. One typically chooses \\\\hat \\\\psi_2 to be a smooth bump function. Then \\\\psi \\\\in L^2(\\\\R^2) given by :\\\\hat\\\\psi(\\\\xi) = \\\\hat\\\\psi_1(\\\\xi_1) \\\\hat\\\\psi_2\\\\left( \\\\tfrac{\\\\xi_2}{\\\\xi_1} \\\\right), \\\\quad \\\\xi = (\\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2) \\\\in \\\\R^2, is called a classical shearlet. It can be shown that the corresponding discrete shearlet system \\\\operatorname{SH}(\\\\psi) constitutes a Parseval frame for L^2(\\\\R^2) consisting of bandlimited functions. Another example are compactly supported shearlet systems, where a compactly supported function \\\\psi \\\\in L^2(\\\\R^2) can be chosen so that \\\\operatorname{SH}(\\\\psi) forms a frame for L^2(\\\\R^2). In this case, all shearlet elements in \\\\operatorname{SH}(\\\\psi) are compactly supported providing superior spatial localization compared to the classical shearlets, which are bandlimited. Although a compactly supported shearlet system does not generally form a Parseval frame, any function f \\\\in L^2(\\\\R^2) can be represented by the shearlet expansion due to its frame property.  Cone- adapted shearlets  One drawback of shearlets defined as above is the directional bias of shearlet elements associated with large shearing parameters. This effect is already recognizable in the frequency tiling of classical shearlets (see Figure in Section #Examples), where the frequency support of a shearlet increasingly aligns along the \\\\xi_2-axis as the shearing parameter s goes to infinity. This causes serious problems when analyzing a function whose Fourier transform is concentrated around the \\\\xi_2-axis. Decomposition of the frequency domain into cones. To deal with this problem, the frequency domain is divided into a low-frequency part and two conic regions (see Figure): : \\\\begin{align} \\\\mathcal{R} &= \\\\left{ (\\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2) \\\\in \\\\R^2 \\\\mid \\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2 \\\\leq 1 \\\\right}, \\\\ \\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathrm{h}} &= \\\\left{ (\\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2) \\\\in \\\\R^2 \\\\mid  \\\\xi_2 / \\\\xi_1  \\\\leq 1, \\\\xi_1 > 1 \\\\right}, \\\\ \\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathrm{v}} &= \\\\left{ (\\\\xi_1, \\\\xi_2) \\\\in \\\\R^2 \\\\mid  \\\\xi_1 / \\\\xi_2  \\\\leq 1, \\\\xi_2 > 1 \\\\right}. \\\\end{align} Frequency tiling of the cone-adapted shearlet system generated by the classical shearlet. The associated cone-adapted discrete shearlet system consists of three parts, each one corresponding to one of these frequency domains. It is generated by three functions \\\\phi, \\\\psi, \\\\tilde\\\\psi \\\\in L^2(\\\\R^2) and a lattice sampling factor c = (c_1, c_2) \\\\in (\\\\R_{> 0})^2: : \\\\operatorname{SH}(\\\\phi, \\\\psi, \\\\tilde\\\\psi; c) = \\\\Phi(\\\\phi; c_1) \\\\cup \\\\Psi(\\\\psi; c) \\\\cup \\\\tilde\\\\Psi(\\\\tilde\\\\psi; c), where : \\\\begin{align} \\\\Phi(\\\\phi; c_1) &= { \\\\phi_m = \\\\phi(\\\\cdot{} - c_1 m) \\\\mid m \\\\in \\\\Z^2 }, \\\\ \\\\Psi(\\\\psi; c) &= { \\\\psi_{j,k,m} = 2^{3j/4} \\\\psi(S_k A_{2^j} \\\\cdot{} - M_c m) \\\\mid j \\\\geq 0, k \\\\leq \\\\lceil 2^{j/2} \\\\rceil, m \\\\in \\\\Z^2 }, \\\\ \\\\tilde\\\\Psi(\\\\tilde\\\\psi; c) &= { \\\\tilde{\\\\psi}_{j,k,m} = 2^{3j/4} \\\\psi(\\\\tilde{S}_k \\\\tilde{A}_{2^j} \\\\cdot{} - \\\\tilde{M}_c m) \\\\mid j \\\\geq 0, k \\\\leq \\\\lceil 2^{j/2} \\\\rceil, m \\\\in \\\\Z^2 }, \\\\end{align} with : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\tilde{A}_a = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a^{1/2} & 0 \\\\ 0 & a \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\; a > 0, \\\\quad \\\\tilde{S}_s = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ s & 1 \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\; s \\\\in \\\\R, \\\\quad M_c = \\\\begin{bmatrix} c_1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & c_2 \\\\end{bmatrix}, \\\\quad \\\\text{and} \\\\quad \\\\tilde{M}_c = \\\\begin{bmatrix} c_2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & c_1 \\\\end{bmatrix}. \\\\end{align} The systems \\\\Psi(\\\\psi) and \\\\tilde\\\\Psi(\\\\tilde\\\\psi) basically differ in the reversed roles of x_1 and x_2. Thus, they correspond to the conic regions \\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathrm{h}} and \\\\mathcal{C}_{\\\\mathrm{v}}, respectively. Finally, the scaling function \\\\phi is associated with the low-frequency part \\\\mathcal{R}.

The film had its world premiere on October 13, 2013 at the London Film Festival and Eleanore Pienta as a pregnant woman that has a complicated personal relationship with her family. Tobia initially came up with the concept for the film after viewing one of Eleanore Pienta's photography projects, which featured a pregnant woman that had a phobia of her fetus contracting an infection by flies. From there Tobia wrote the film's script and added additional characters to round out the cast. Filming took place in Brooklyn in Greenpoint, Sunset Park, and Bushwick. Synopsis Mona (Eleanore Pienta) is an unpleasant pregnant woman that ends up getting fired from her job as a checkout clerk at a grocery store in Brooklyn. She's later kicked out of her mother May's (Dana Eskelson) apartment, which forces her to move in with her lesbian sister Jordan (Molly Plunk) and her girlfriend Sylve (Keisha Zollar). Mona's relationship with Jordan is as toxic as her relationship with her mother, and her presence soon puts an additional strain on Jordan and Sylve's own relationship.

The Tucson Weekly and Toronto Star both praised the film, and the Toronto Star commented that the film was sometimes \\"abrasive\\" and that \\"Flashes of humour and some unexpected moments of poignancy help temper the rough stuff\\". Critics for IndieWire lauded the film, with one critic citing the movie's birth scene as a highlight while the other remarked that See You Next Tuesday deserved more attention than it got. The Hollywood Reporter panned See You Next Tuesday overall, as they felt that it was \\"deeply unpleasant\\" and that it was \\"solely for viewers who demand extremes.\\" Awards *Best Movie ifab Brandenburg Gate Award at the International Film Awards Berlin (2014, won) *Jambor-Franklin Founder's Award for Best Narrative at the Birmingham Sidewalk Moving Picture Festival (2013, won) *Audience Choice Award for Best Feature Film at the Chicago Underground Film Festival (2013, won) *Duncan-Williams Scriptwriting Award at the Indie Memphis Film Festival (2013, won) *Special Jury Award for outstanding performance at the Indie Memphis Film Festival (2013, won - Eleanor Pienta) *Most Effectively Offensive at the Boston Underground Film Festival (2013, won) ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2013 films Category:American independent films Category:American films Category:Films shot in New York (state) ","title":"See You Next Tuesday (film)"},{"id":"41918986","text":"Neoscaptia leucodera is a moth of the subfamily Arctiinae.

The following talks between Nicos Anastasiades, President of Cyprus, and Dervi≈ü Eroƒülu, President of Northern Cyprus, were stalled in October 2014. Background Post-independence disputes between the Greek and Turkish communities in the Republic of Cyprus resulted, after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, in the self- declaration of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Attempts during the intervening forty years to resolve the division and re-unite Cyprus, most notably the Annan Plan between 2002 and 2004 had all failed, the Annan Plan doing so when, in parallel referendums in April 2004, the Turkish community had voted to accept but the Greek community had voted to reject it. Further negotiations took place after the Greek Cypriot presidential election of 2008 but these first ran into difficulty over disputes about the extent of the Republic of Cyprus's exclusive economic zone and oil exploration within it, and then collapsed over a legal case in a British court which supported Greek Cypriots' property rights within territory controlled by Northern Cyprus. Further meetings in 2010 and 2011 had no significant results and talks were suspended in 2012. However, some things changed during 2012 and 2013. Gas was discovered in both Cypriot and neighbouring Israeli waters, but the simplest way of getting it to customers in Europe would be via a pipeline through Turkey. The banking collapse in 2013 in the Republic of Cyprus led to economic shrinkage and high unemployment, and reunification could be expected to speed economic recovery and growth. After a lapse of several years, America showed interest in working actively for a solution to the dispute. Nicos Anastasiades, elected President of the Republic of Cyprus in February 2013, had supported the Annan Plan. The date proposed for renewing talks was October 2013. However, Anastasiades regarded agreement on a joint declaration as a precondition for talks, and agreement on the wording of the declaration was only achieved in February 2014. The Joint Declaration On 11 February 2014, the leaders of Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities, Nicos Anastasiades and Dervi≈ü Eroƒülu, respectively, revealed the following joint declaration: Reactions to the Joint Declaration The governments of both Greece and Turkey expressed their support for renewed peace talks. The declaration was also welcomed by the European Union. On 13 February 2014, Archbishop Chrysostomos lent Anastasiades his backing on the Joint Declaration. On 14 February 2014, the Greek Cypriot negotiator Andreas Mavroyiannis and Turkish Cypriot negotiator Kudret Ozersay held their first meeting and agreed to visit Greece and Turkey respectively. Reactions among the Greek Cypriot political parties were mixed. The opposition AKEL party declared its support for the declaration. However, Nicolas Papadopoulos, the leader of DIKO, the main partner to Anastasiades' party DISY in the governing coalition, opposed the declaration, and DIKO's executive committee voted on 21 February to recommend to the party's central committee that the party withdraw from the coalition from 4 March. On 27 February, DIKO decided to leave the coalition government, with the rationale that the Joint Declaration conceded separate sovereignty to Turkish Cypriots.Cyprus Mail 27 February 2014  End of the talks  In October 2014, the talks stalled as a result of a crisis ensuing from Turkey's sending of a warship to the Republic of Cyprus-controlled part of the Cypriot waters, as a part of a crisis over the exploration of offshore natural gas reserves. Anastasiades refused to attend the meeting on 9 October 2014, and talks did not resume until May 2015, after the election of Mustafa Akƒ±ncƒ± as the Turkish Cypriot president in April 2015.

The ability to take on the user's point of view, without personal judgement or bias, allows the advocate to see things as the user might see them, enabling them to ultimately make observations and perhaps recommendations to improve the user experience. Similarly, some user advocates will take a neutral, scientific point of view, and will observe and collect data from users that will suggest that the product and/or user experience could be changed or improved in a way that users would prefer or benefit from. User advocates may be scientists or engineers who use the scientific method to make improvements that result in increased ease of use, time savings, improved levels of user satisfaction, or other user-centered metrics. An advocate is a person who argues for or supports a cause or policy. A user advocate could either be a person, as in a research study; a persona, fictional characters that represent a typical customer or segment of the customer base; or a community, such as participants of a public discussion board.  Origins  The idea of user advocates originated from large-scale software development projects. In such teams, a consensus is reached regarding the roles of a product designer (or systems designer) and the user experience (UX) analyst, that the two roles (designer and UX analyst) can no longer be effectively performed by the same individual(s) due to inherent conflicting interests. An example of such a conflict of interest would be a designer having to defend his own design decision about a product improvement, versus an alternative decision that could lead to a better user experience, but would negate the designer's original decision about how to improve the product. Designer interaction with actual users on such large-scale projects would often be viewed as expensive and inefficient for some designers, but an alternative view suggests that some designers and some companies do not value interaction with actual users. Some experts have suggested that designers and developers may even have contempt for actual users. In large-scale projects there is often a practical necessity for the division of labor, but that should not be used to justify lack of user involvement at each step of the software development life cycle. The person responsible for designing a product may be far removed from the development of a product, and even further removed from traditional user experience studies, which analyze how users interact with a product versus how it was designed to be used. The degrees of separation inherent in these large-scale projects can create a disconnect between ambitious designers who risk creating ineffective products that they prefer to design, instead of designing what users want and need. Care must be taken to involve the user at each step of the design cycle, lest the needs of the user be ignored and a sub-standard product design result. The idea of a consultant with expertise working with a client group has theoretical origins in models of process consulting, Schein, E. H. (1988): Process Consultation: Its Role in Organization Development. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley. which focus on developing close relationships to work out joint solutions.  Developing user personas for the purpose of user advocacy  One practice of user advocacy asks designers to define their users collectively, as one person or a persona, and attach common attributes and characteristics of their typical users, taking into consideration many types of use case scenarios users typically encounter to aid with anticipating the needs and expectations of a user. From this persona and its associated traits, tendencies, use case scenarios, functional requirements and user expectations can be derived and provide refined specifications for product improvements to be developed. Such a practice essentially channels access product designers to users by representing their needs in the form a persona or fictional character.  Benefits of user advocacy in product design  User advocacy also helps make the effects of design decisions easier to measure because the traits and characteristics of user personas often consist of crowdsourced suggestions from actual users. Suggestions for improvement are generalized and prioritized according to frequency, severity, or an alignment with corporate initiatives. As a result, design decisions become less about a designer and more about fulfilling the needs of users, as the suggestions for improvement are typically provided directly by the users themselves.User Advocacy in Participatory Design: Designers‚Äô Experiences with a New Communication Channel Mambrey, Peter, Gloria Mark, and Uta Pankoke-Babatz. \\"User advocacy in participatory design: Designers' experiences with a new communication channel.\\" Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) 7.3-4 (1998): 291-313.

This film is directed by Karen Lloyd and features the voice of Kelly Sheridan as Princess Alexa, a shy princess who discovers a secret door in her kingdom and enters a whimsical land filled with magic-induced creatures. Plot Set in a modern-day kingdom, Alexa is a shy, book-reading princess who avoids doing the duties expected of her due to her rank. In order to encourage her, Alexa's grandmother gives her a storybook about a princess who discovers she has magic. While reading the book, Alexa discovers a mysterious door in the royal gardens. She enters the door and finds herself in a fantasy land. Alexa meets Nori, a fairy missing her wings, and Romy, a mermaid with legs instead of her tail. Nori and Romy are thrilled because as a princess, Alexa can perform magic with a wand. Their realm is under threat by the mean Princess Malucia, a spoiled child princess who was born without magic and has been taking it by force from all the creatures she can capture. Alexa is brought to the glade where fairies, mermaids and unicorns are hiding from Malucia. There, Alexa slowly learns to use her wand. However, she cannot return Nori and Romy to their original forms, because their magic is trapped in Malucia's scepter. The group learn that Malucia is trying to find the Queen Unicorn, who is the most magical creature in the realm. Alexa, Nori, and Romy travel to the Queen Unicorn, hoping to protect her, only to unintentionally lead Malucia and her minions right to her. Malucia captures the Queen Unicorn, while Nori and Romy provide a distraction so that Alexa can escape. While fleeing, Alexa discovers the doorway back to her world but decides to stay and help. Alexa, Nori, and Romy go to Malucia's palace, where they witness Malucia draining all the unicorns' magic into her scepter. Alexa confronts Malucia, declaring that she is a princess, too, which provokes Malucia into a magical battle to \\"prove\\" who is the better princess. During the fight, Alexa realizes that Malucia's scepter is cracking under its magical content. Alexa willingly lets Malucia steal all her magic, which causes Malucia's scepter to explode, releasing all its magic. Malucia is harmless once again, and Alexa, who can now perform magic without a wand, returns all the magic to their rightful owners. After promising to visit again soon, Alexa returns to her kingdom more confident, and more willing to participate in her princess duties. As for Malucia, her parents return from their holiday and scold her for trying to take over the kingdom again.

Built by the State in 1868, it was once Denmark's principal fishing harbour but today has become Europe's leading port for shipping offshore wind turbines.  History  Esbjerg was established in 1868 as a replacement for the harbour in Altona, which had previously been Denmark's most important North Sea port but came under German control after the Second Schleswig War in 1864. The harbour was officially opened in 1874. The same year, it benefited from Esbjerg's rail connection to Fredericia on the east coast of Jutland. The initial development of the harbour was completed in 1874. It quickly became a hub for exporting agricultural goods to England, especially butter and bacon. Thanks to the harbour's shipping facilities, by the end of the 19th century, livestock production in the surrounding region increased significantly. From the beginning of the 20th century, Esbjerg attracted fishermen from across the country, particularly for fishing plaice. Located some , Bl√•vand Lighthouse has served traffic from the Port of Esbjerg since its construction in 1900. The Port of Esbjerg was administered by the State until 2000 when it became privately controlled under Esbjerg Municipality. Today it is one of the four largest ports in Denmark enjoying a central position in the region's infrastructure. In addition to container and passenger traffic, it has attracted fish-processing activities and marine repair work as well as a wide variety of supporting services. Passenger ferries DFDS formerly operated an overnight ferry to Harwich in the south of England, taking about 12 hours. The service ended on 29 September 2014 after 140 years. A new ferry company has announced their intention to restart the service in April 2015, but by March 2017 no new ferry service has been opened. There were also ferry connections between Esbjerg and Newcastle but these have been discontinued. Over the past few years (written 2014), the number of passengers using the port per annum has averaged 1.8 million. Harbour details The Port of Esbjerg covers a total land area of 3.5 million m2 (1.35 sq miles), has of quays and an alongside depth of some . The Tauruskay offshore wharf has a depth of while the bulk cargo Australienkaj, the Europakaj and the Vestkraftkaj for containers all have an alongside depth of . The Englandskaj serving passenger traffic has a length of and an alongside depth of while the F√¶rgehavn handling containers, passengers and ferries over a length of has an alongside depth varying from to . Other wharfs include the Humberkaj for frozen cargoes, the Containerkaj for roll-on, roll-off containerized cargoes and the Oliebro for liquid bulk carriers. In recent years, the port has handled some 4 million tons of cargo a year, of which some 500,000 tons have been liquid fuels.  Offshore  Esbjerg has served the Danish offshore industry since oil and gas was first extracted from the North Sea in the early 1970s. More recently, it has become a centre for shipping offshore wind turbines. In addition to handling 65 percent of all Danish wind turbines (which now supply 3 GW of offshore wind power), the port has shipped components to various British wind farms. In order to cope with future increases in Danish offshore wind power, twelve companies including DONG Energy and Bluewater Energy Services are planning the establishment of a Green Offshore Centre in Esbjerg. In this connection, in June 2013 the port was significantly expanded with the opening of the √òsthavn (East Harbour) covering an area of . Further expansion started in 2017, including two roll-on/roll-off discharge facilities.

She became particularly well- known in Spain in the 70‚Äôs, after her collaborations on children‚Äôs television shows. In her work, she defended equality between men and women, pacifism and the fight for the environment. With the centenary of her birth in 2017, the recognition of her role in Spanish poetry as a whole during the 20th century has increased greatly. She was born and died in Madrid, Spain.  Biography  Gloria Fuertes was born in a modest family in Madrid in 1917. Her mother was a seamstress and maid; her father, a beadle. She attended the Institute of Vocational Education of Women, where she studied Shorthand, Typing and Childcare. Her interest in writing started at the early age of five, when she started writing and illustrating stories. However, she also declared that her family did not support her in the slightest and that her mother would reprimand her if she saw her with a book. Nevertheless she published her first poem at age fourteen: Childhood, Youth, Old Age (Ni√±ez, Juventud, Vejez) and at seventeen shaped her first book of poems, Isla Ignorada, to be published in 1950. In 1934 she started working as an accountant and secretary, jobs that for a long time she combined with writing stories for children, theatre plays and, increasingly, poetry. Although she always defined herself as \\"self-taught and poetically deschooling\\" her name has been linked to two literary movements: The Generation of 50 and Postismo, a literary group of postwar who joined late 40s and were part Carlos Edmundo de Ory, Eduardo Chicharro and Silvano Sernesi, and which also collaborated Angel Crespo and Francisco Nieva. Postismo remained forever in Gloria Fuertes demystifying poetic attitude by way of humor; humor in Gloria Fuertes is a critical way of constructing reality and discovering the truth of things. The Civil War left a deep impression on her. The anti-war and protest against the absurdity of civilization are present in her poetry categorically. As she said, \\"without the tragedy of war I might never had written poetry.\\" In the aftermath of her war experience, Gloria Fuertes's work is characterized by irony dealing with universal issues such as love, pain, death and loneliness. All of it seasoned with strange metaphors and linguistic games full of charm, freshness and simplicity, which give her poems a great musicality and cadence near the oral language. There has been speculation about her homosexuality, which subtly appear declared in poems like \\"What Irritates Me\\", \\"I am open to all,\\" \\"Jenny,\\" etc. Between 1940 and 1953 she began working in children's magazines, Pelayos, Chicos, Chicas, Chiquitito, y children's books \\"Flechas y Pelayos\\" (Maravillas) and the newspaper Arriba, which published the comic strip \\"Pigtails and Pelines\\" (a nine-year-old girl and a six-year-old boy respectively). They achieved great popularity among young readers. Alongside her dedication to children's literature in magazines, plays and poems, she, along with Maria Dolores and Adelaida Lasantas, founded in 1951 the group \\"Verses in Skirts\\" that organized concerts and poetry readings by bars and locals cafes, collaborated in adult magazines such as Directions, Spanish Poetry and Straw Bird, and created and directed the poetry magazine between 1950-1954 Archer, along with Antonio Gala, Julio Mariscal and Rafael Mir. From 1955 to 1960 she studied library science and English at the International Institute. In 1961 she won the Fulbright scholarship in the United States to teach Spanish literature at Bucknell University; then she taught at Mary Baldwin University and Bryn Mawr College and taught Spanish to Americans at the International Institute until 1963; then she received Scholarship in 1972 from the Juan March Foundation for Children's Literature. In the mid-1970s she became actively involved in various children's programs TVE, Siendo Un Globo, Dos Globos, Tres Globos y La Cometa Blanca, which definitively became the poetry of children. Receiving five times the Aro de Plata for this information medium. From these years the activity of Gloria Fuertes is unstoppable: readings, concerts, tributes ... always near children; continuously publishing poetry for children and adults. She became very popular after the parody Martes y Trece made it into \\"Especial Nochevieja\\" (New Year's Eve Special). Indefatigable heavy smoker, she died of lung cancer on November 27, 1998 and was buried in the South Cemetery Madrid. In 2001 her remains were transferred to the Cemetery of La Paz of Alcobendas (Madrid). She left her fortune to a Catholic orphanage.  Gender equality  The friendly and fresh orality in her work, set her far from the accepted poetic pattern, according to Sharon Keefe Ugalde, from the University of Texas. Some experts affirm that another circumstance against the triumph of Fuertes‚Äô work was the fact that she was a woman, lesbian and poor. Reyes Vila-Belda from the University of Indiana emphasizes that she opened up the world of poetry to the worries of the voiceless people: women, workers and poor people. Fuertes reclaimed the right of women, starting with the right to read, write, work or being a poet in a historical moment when they were confined to the domestic sphere. She also called into question traditional female roles during the Spanish dictatorship under General Franco, and presented instead a new model of woman. One of her most known works to this regard is Three Wise Queens: Melchora, Gaspara y Baltasara, published in 1978 and by now a children's literature classic in Spain. In the story, Melchor, Gaspar and Baltasar are unable to go to Bethlehem, so their wives undertake the journey instead, and they play a protagonist role, as a contrast to the post-war society that had relegated women to their homes. Here, the mothers who are also wise queens as the fathers went to fight in the war, must follow the star and bring the gifts to the newborn Jesus. Apart from fighting for gender equality, Fuertes was also an activist for environmental causes and a pacifist that publicly opposed the wars in Vietnam and Cambodia, as she opposed the Spanish Civil War in 1936.

The mosque has a documented history that goes back over 500 years. The earliest European reference to the mosque appears in a description from November 1505 when the commander of a Portuguese expedition anchored in Colombo bay. In 1520 following an attack on the Portuguese trading post, established earlier by Lopo de Brito, the Captain of Portuguese Ceylon, the King Bhuvanaikabahu of Kotte burnt the town (Colombo) along with two large mosques. The mosque was however rebuilt on the same site soon after. In the 1820s, the mosque was redesigned and rebuilt by Malay architect, Muhammad Balangkaya, the son of a Malay noble of the Royal House of Gowa (present-day Sulawesi, Indonesia), who was exiled to Ceylon in 1790 by the Dutch. The mosque was rebuilt as a two- storey structure, one of the first of its kind. In 1826 the British Governor of Ceylon, Edward Barnes, visited the mosque and commended the architect on the excellence of his work.http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lkawgw/cgm.html In 1827 Sir Alexander Johnston discovered an Arabic inscribed tombstone dating to 948AD, which had been moved by the Dutch from the old Muslim cemetery next to the Grand Mosque, which indicates the mosque may be over 1,100 years old and possibly the oldest mosque in Sri Lanka.http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lkawgw/cgm.html In 1897 an additional wing was constructed under the supervision of I. L. M. H. Muhammad Mohideen. The wing was used in 1959 as classrooms for the newly established school, Al- Madrasathul Hameedia. In 1921 the name of the school was changed to the Hameedia Boys' English School. The mosque was reconstructed again during 1900s to meet the modern needs of the Muslim community.

For instance, algorithms for problems like the construction of a convex hull rely on testing whether certain \\"numerical predicates\\" have values that are positive, negative, or zero. If an inexact floating-point computation causes a value that is near zero to have a different sign than its exact value, the resulting inconsistencies can propagate through the algorithm causing it to produce output that is far from the correct output, or even to crash. One method for avoiding this problem involves using integers rather than floating point numbers for all coordinates and other quantities represented by the algorithm, and determining the precision required for all calculations to avoid integer overflow conditions. For instance, two-dimensional convex hulls can be computed using predicates that test the sign of quadratic polynomials, and therefore may require twice as many bits of precision within these calculations as the input numbers. When integer arithmetic cannot be used (for instance, when the result of a calculation is an algebraic number rather than an integer or rational number), a second method is to use symbolic algebra to perform all computations with exactly represented algebraic numbers rather than numerical approximations to them. A third method, sometimes called a \\"floating point filter\\", is to compute numerical predicates first using an inexact method based on floating point arithmetic, but to maintain bounds on how accurate the result is, and repeat the calculation using slower symbolic algebra methods or numerically with additional precision when these bounds do not separate the calculated value from zero.

It is affiliated with the International Biathlon Union and the Australian Olympic Committee. It is based at the only biathlon range in Australia, at Mount Hotham, Victoria.  History and general information  The Australian Biathlon Association began in the 1970s as the North East Victoria Biathlon Association, it has remained the national governing body for the sport of biathlon in Australia, evolving to become the Victorian Biathlon Association, then the Australian/Victorian Biathlon Association in the early 1980s, and is now the Australian Biathlon Association, reflecting its membership base and unitary model of governance. The Australian Biathlon Association majority of members are still Victorian residents; however there are members who travel from Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory to take part in this Winter Olympic sport each Australian winter. Australia first sent a participant to the Winter Olympic Games at Sarajevo in 1984 (Andrew Paul, VIC) and the first woman biathlete Olympian was Kerryn Rim (NE VIC), Australia's highest-placed Olympic performer, finishing 8th in Women 15 km Individual (Distance) race in 1994. In 2016‚Äì2017, the ABA undertook the largest redevelopment of the Whiskey Flat range at Mount Hotham, to allow 15 lanes of participants at one time. The 15 lanes were ready for the 2017 Australian Winter season of biathlon, and at the Australian Biathlon Championships in August 2017, the range was officially named the Hotham Biathlon Arena, by the Patron of the Australian Biathlon Association, Ms Danielle Green MP, Parliamentary Secretary for Regional Victoria and Parliamentary Secretary for Tourism and Major Events. After Winter 2017, part of the Hotham Biathlon Arena tracks were sealed to allow rollerskiing during summer. Biathlon upgrade to facilities was also undertaken in 2017 at SSAA Range in Wodonga. Both of these projects are part of the Victorian Government Shooting Sports Facilities Program. The Association is responsible for the development of biathlon at all levels in Australia and beyond, from grass roots to elite to Masters/Veterans. These activities range from \\"Laserland\\" at the Hotham Biathlon Arena and local branches for those Under 12, to sending athletes to International Biathlon Union events during the IBU winter season, plus developing coaches through attendance at the IBU Coach Seminars each year, along with sending developing athletes and coaches to specialist IBU Development Camps each year.  Structure  The Australian Biathlon Association has a modern, streamlined unitary model of governance, with one member one vote, regardless of state/territory of residence. There are several regional branches around Australia, made up of members resident in the area. The largest organisation associated with the ABA is the Australian Defence Force Nordic Biathlon Association. Due to state firearms legislation, the sport of biathlon may only be practised in the State of Victoria; elsewhere in Australia, members undertake target-rifle-type training events, leading up to peak ABA events at the Hotham Biathlon Arena in winter each year. There is an increasing participation in summer biathlon events at the Hotham Biathlon Arena, near Mount Hotham, VIC, site of the only biathlon range in Australia, with the first Australian Summer Biathlon Championships being held in Easter 2018, following a grant from the Victorian State Government to install a new rollerski track.

It was founded by Eddie Einhorn and Pedro Martinez in 1975. The company descended from the National Wrestling Federation. It was originally intended to be the first national wrestling promotion, but stayed primarily in the Mid-Atlantic region. Einhorn offered his wrestlers more money and benefits than competing promotions, helping to lure big names such as Mil Mascaras (the company's heavyweight champion). Einhorn left the promotion later that year, and Johnny Powers took over as booker. The company scaled down and stayed in Virginia and North Carolina. After losing an antitrust lawsuit against the rival Jim Crockett Promotions, the IWA closed in 1978. History In the 1970s, Ron Martinez introduced his friend Eddie Einhorn to his father Pedro Martinez, and the duo established the International Wrestling Association in 1975 as a descendant company of Martinez's National Wrestling Federation. The IWA was originally intended to be the first national wrestling promotion. Einhorn offered professional wrestler George Scott a $250,000 a year salary and percentage of the business to be his partner in the promotion, but Scott declined. To get prominent professional wrestlers such as Ernie Ladd and Mil Mascaras, the company used contracts that guaranteed money to the talent regardless of ticket sales. Einhorn also offered wrestlers deals that included transportation and lodging, in contrast to other promotions. Mascaras was one of the promotion's initial champions. He mainly feuded with Ladd over the IWA Championship. Another one of the promotion's main feuds was between Mighty Igor and Bulldog Brower. During the storyline, Brower attacked Igor on his birthday, knocking him into his birthday cake. The IWA's early house shows featuring Mascaras were competition for Vince McMahon's World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). One show at the Roosevelt Stadium featured former WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Ivan Koloff against Mascaras, drawing an attendance of 14,000. Later, the IWA shows were taped for television and aired on WOR (Channel 9) while the WWWF aired shows on Spanish-language WNJU (Channel 47). The IWA used new innovations like freeze frame shots and replays in slow motion to enhance the matches. Ron Martinez acted as booker, announcer, and producer for the television shows. Jack Reynolds and Tex McKenzie acted as play-by-play announcers, and Rick Gattone was the ring announcer. Einhorn's plan was for the show to be nationally syndicated. Einhorn left the IWA in late 1975 due to business conflicts and a large financial loss. At that time, Tom Ficara acquired the IWA Wrestling programming for his FBC Cable Network. Ficara subsequently bought TVS itself in 1990. Subsequently, Johnny Powers became the booker for the IWA and scaled down the promotion. The company ran shows in Virginia and North Carolina for a couple of years. Ron Martinez stayed with the promotion for three years after Einhorn left. The promotion closed after an antitrust case that accused Jim Crockett, Jr. of preventing the IWA from promoting shows in the area's large arenas, including the Winston-Salem Coliseum. The case was not successful and the promotion closed in 1978. The show was shown overseas in Nigeria and Singapore in 1978. Clips from the tape library were featured on ESPN's Cheap Seats, as well as ESPN Classic's Golden Age Of Wrestling. Championships The main championship for the company was the IWA Championship. Mil Mascaras was the champion, winning it in Savannah, Georgia in 1975. He also defended the championship in Mexico. The exact lineage of the title is unknown, but Johnny Powers claims to have held it three times. Even after the promotion closed in 1978, Powers defended the title overseas. He last defended it against Bulldog Brower in Nigeria in 1982, after which he retired from wrestling. The Mongols (Geeto Mongol and Bolo Mongol) were the company's only holders of the IWA Tag Team Championship. After Eddie Einhorn left the promotion, The Mongols also left, taking the IWA Tag Team Championship with them to rival Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) in January 1976. In JCP, they were billed as the International Tag Team Champions. The IWA North American Championship was the only title in the promotion to officially change hands. The first holder of the title was Ox Baker. He held the title for less than a year before losing it to Bulldog Brower. Female wrestlers also had a title in the promotion, the IWA Women's North American Championship. The sole holder of the title was Estelle Molina.

History Norwegian bandy was originally organised by the Football Association of Norway, but an independent federation for the 'winter football' was established in 1920. In the first years, this was called Norges Ishockeyforbund, because bandy was called ishockey (ice hockey) back then, since it is a form of hockey played on ice, but when the Canadian sport of ice hockey came to Norway, the international name bandy was adopted for what was actually bandy, and the term ishockey was reserved for what now is called ice hockey. The present name Norges Bandyforbund was consequently adopted in 1929. The Norwegian bandyforbund has been pushing for bandy to be an Olympic sport, and their argument being that bandy has the second most players within winter sports behind hockey with 500000 players.

Berlyne worked at several universities both in Canada and the United States. His work was in the field of experimental and exploratory psychology. Specifically, his research focused on how objects and experiences are influenced by and have an influence on curiosity and arousal. Biography Berlyne was born in Salford, Greater Manchester, England on April 25, 1924. There he attended Manchester Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge. From there he received his Bachelor's Degree in 1947 and Master's Degree in 1949. From there he went to Yale University where, while teaching full-time at Brooklyn College in New York City, he earned his PhD in 1951. In 1953 Berlyne was forced to leave the United States because of problems with his visa. He worked in Scotland as a professor until his return to the United States in 1957. Awards and recognition Berlyne held fellowships at the Royal Society of Canada, the British Psychological Society, and at several other American and Canadian psychological associations. He also served as president of the Canadian Psychological Association from 1971 to 1972 and of the General Psychology and Psychology and Arts departments of the American Psychological Associations from 1973 to 1974. That year, 1974, he was co-president of the XVIIIth International Congress of Applied Psychology in Montreal, vice president of the Canadian and American departments of the Interamerican Society of Psychology, and as president of the International Association of Empirical Aesthetics. Work=Academic and teaching Berlynes first academic teaching position was at St. Andrew's University in Scotland while he was still a student at Cambridge. He then worked at Brooklyn College while pursuing his PhD at Yale University. During his return to Great Britain, Berlyne worked at the University of Aberdeen for four years, from 1953 until 1957. He was also a resident member at the Centre International d'Epistemologie Genetique in Geneva, Switzerland from 1958 to 1959, and a visiting scientist and the National Institute of Mental Health in Maryland from 1959 until 1960. He worked as an associate professor at Boston University until 1962, when he was hired as a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, where he remained until his death in 1976. Writing Berlyne has published seven books, including: Conflict, Arousal and Curiosity (1960), Humor and its Kin (1972), Invited Commentary: B.F. Skinner's Beyond Freedom and Dignity (1972), and Behaviorism? Cognitive Theory? Humanistic Psychology?‚Äî To Hull with Them All (1974). He has also authored hundreds of articles and chapters such as 'Interest' as a Psychological Concept in 1949, an article which he claims to have introduced the concept of curiosity into psychological literature. Research Berlyne is often considered the heir to C.L. Hull's Hullian School of behavior. Thus, most of Berlyne's work focused on the effects of and reactions to curiosity and arousal, rather than focus on the ideas as states of being. His work focused on \\"why organisms display curiosity and explore their environment, why they seek knowledge and information\\". He believed that objects impact on three levels, psychophysical, environmental, and collative. The last of these was a term coined by Berlyne which attempted to describe the hedonic levels of arousal fluctuation through stimuli such as novelty, complexity, surprisingness, incongruity. Ultimately, he believed that arousal was best and most effective when at a moderate level and influenced by the complexity and novelty of the arousing object.

It tells the story of a French prime minister (Jean Gabin), a lifelong proponent of the national good, who is twice betrayed by an opportunistic younger politician (Bernard Blier) but in the end gets his revenge. The film's title refers to the former French term for prime minister, which was pr√©sident du conseil des ministres (chairman of the cabinet), but has since been replaced by the term premier ministre (prime minister). Plot Aged 73 and in ill-health, a former prime minister of France, the widower √âmile Beaufort, spends his days in his country house near Evreux dictating his memoirs to his secretary. He gets to the point, some twenty years earlier, when he had to devalue the currency. After secretly meeting the governor of the central bank and the minister of finance, he agreed to make the announcement one Monday. That morning, huge currency speculation broke out and Beaufort realised only one other person knew of the plan. This was Philippe Chalamont, the head of his private office, whose father-in-law was a banker. He made Chalamont write out and sign a confession, which he has kept ever since. In his last term as prime minister, he was a passionate advocate of European union, seeing it as a healing of the hatreds which had torn the continent apart. His most persuasive opponent turned out to be Chalamont, by then in Parliament, who argued it would be bad for French business. In disgust at this petty-minded and sectional approach, Beaufort resigned and gave up politics. Chalamont has now been asked to form a government and Beaufort summons him to Evreux that evening. Before his enemy turns up, he removes the confession from its hiding place, puts it in his pocket and dozes off in front of the fire. He wakes up to find his secretary searching the room and, confronted, she admits she was bribed to find the incriminating document. Beaufort burns it and waits. When shown in, Chalamont opens with a spiel about relying in his new post on the advice of Beaufort, who he has always admired and trusted, and how he too now believes in European unity. Beaufort is not fooled, preferring France to have a new prime minister who is not a crook and a liar, so he threatens to divulge the currency incident to the media. Next morning, the news is that Chalamont has declined to form a new government. Difference from the book As noted, the film changed the ending of the original Simenon book. Throughout the book the protagonist does contemplate what he actually does in the film, i.e. to use the evidence in his possession to derail Chalamont's plans - but eventually he relents. The book ends with The Premier adopting a detached, stoic attitude, withdrawing from any further involvement in politics and serenely preparing for his approaching death. He leaves his former protege to form a cabinet in peace, and burns documents incriminating various other politicians which he had kept hidden for years. In the process he discovers, without much surprise, that his staff had been spying on him for years and that his secretary had long since discovered all these incriminating documents and let an ambitious police inspector photocopy them. Musing that the inspector would likely use the papers to blackmail his way to a high position, the Premier takes also that revelation stoically and without malice.

Pope Felix III (13 March 483‚Äì492) excommunicated Acacius for his heretical theories. Thus the foundation was laid for the Acacian Schism between the Eastern and Western Christian Churches. Photinus was sent to Pope Anastasius II (496‚Äì498), probably by a supporter of Acacius, to plead his case. This Pope was, however, a moderate and tried to resolve the conflict by allowing the heretic deacon, who had been labelled an Acacian by his predecessor Pope Gelasius I, to partake in holy communion. This peace offering did not sway Photinus, but did result in suspicions among certain groups of Christians in the West about the views and opinions of Pope Anastasius. Pope Anastasius died shortly after this visit in 498 and many Christians in the West perceived his death as a sign of God thus deepening the growing divide between the Western and Eastern Christian Churches even further, which resulted in an additional schism, the so-called Laurentian Schism.  Literary reference  Photinus is mentioned in Dante's Inferno. Dante places Photinus with other heretics in the sixth ring of hell together with Pope Anastasius whom he supposedly led astray according to some Christians in the West. Modern scholars are of the opinion that this is a case of mistaken identity and that Dante did not mean Pope Anastasius, but his namesake and contemporary Emperor Anastasius (Emperor of Byzantium, 491-518).

The deceased Italian was identified as Lorenzo Taddei, who had been travelling from Tana Toraja with his wife. Following the attack, Wirabuana Military Area Commander Maj. Gen. Amirul Isnaeni admitted that a number of Kopassus personnel were stationed in the area to investigate the presence of foreign citizens living in Poso, some of whom may have links to al Qaeda.  Investigation  The bomb blasts are linked to sectarian conflict between Muslims and Christians in Central Sulawesi that killed at least 577 people and displaced another 86,000 during three-year period before a government-sponsored truce agreed in December 2001. The Indonesian authorities' failure to capture the assailants or uncover their identities and whereabouts sparked speculation that sections of the security forces could have been complicit in the Central Sulawesi attacks. A local Muslim figure speculated that violence had escalated after the Wirabuana military command, based in the South Sulawesi capital of Makassar, sent members of Army's Special Force (Kopassus) members to Poso. In response to the attacks, the Indonesian Military called for the imposition of a state of civil emergency or martial law in the restive Poso regency. The suggestion was in response to the rumored presence of several armed foreigners who had allegedly entered Poso on tourist visas. However, then Central Sulawesi Governor, Aminuddin Ponulele, and the provincial police chief Brig. Gen. Zainal Abidin Ishak both voiced opposition to the plan.

He is now remembered for his autobiographical writings. Life Blackhall's background is believed to have been in Aberdeenshire. He spent a period as a soldier of fortune. He entered the Scotch College, Rome in 1626, was ordained priest, and returned to Scotland in 1630. He encountered opposition from Jesuits there, however, and left for Paris, where he became confessor to Lady Isabella Hay, eldest daughter of Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll. Going to Brussels in search of patronage, he had an audience with Isabella Clara Eugenia, right at the end of her life. By persistence he found Lady Isabella a pension, enabling her to return to Scotland. He himself turned down a position, thought to be with the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary. But Isabella Clara Eugenia's death in 1633 closed down chances for Scots in Brussels at court. Lady Isabella was in a house of canonesses at Mons, in 1637. In 1637 Blackhall returned to Scotland, where he did missionary work in Aberdeenshire and Banffshire. He also acted as chaplain to Sophia Hay, Countess of Aboyne at Aboyne Castle; she was the sister of Lady Isabella. The Countess died in 1642, leaving her only child Henrietta Gordon. Blackhall returned to France in 1643, with the view of inducing the Marchioness of Huntly, Henrietta's grandmother, to bring her to France to be educated. He initially failed in this plan, and applied to Anne of Austria, the Queen of France, to use her influence, ultimately successfully. Meanwhile, Henrietta had become a Protestant, but was anyway taken to France. Blackhall had a brief period as head of the Scots College, Paris in 1653. Works Blackhall wrote his autobiography in Paris in 1653. It contains accounts of his relations with Lady Isabella Hay, with the Countess of Aboyne, and with Henrietta Gordon. The title is A breiffe Narration of the Services done to three noble Ladyes, by Gilbert Blakal, Preist of the Scots Mission in France, in the Low Countries, and in Scotland. Dedicated to Madame de Gourdon, one of the forsaid three, and now Dame d'Attour to Madame.

Synopsis The show is based on the Italian dating show Uomini & Donne, and it is focused on single persons. The 'tronistas' (from the Spanish/Italian word 'trono', meaning 'throne', because the protagonist is sitting on an imaginary throne) are 4, usually 2 men and 2 women. These are the protagonists, whose aim is to find their soulmate among some admirers. Each day the \\"tronista\\" can meet new people, and after a brief presentation of them, he/she can decide to keep dating them or not. Moreover, the \\"tronista\\" will decide the candidates he/she wants to date outside the TV studio; during the date he/she has the possibility to know candidates better. Though, there is a fundamental rule, and both the tronistas and the candidates have to respect: they can meet each other just in front of cameras, never privately. If this rule is not respected, they can be evicted from the show. When the tronista chooses their soulmate, there are just a few candidates waiting for their decision.

Views In the period from about 1250 to 1280, Jordan of Osnabr√ºck followed by Alexander wrote two tracts (the Memoriale) supporting the Holy Roman Empire as a German institution. The subject insisted the land south of the Rhine River was Germanic.Scales, 2012, 460. This period covered the rapid decline of the House of Hohenstaufen, and Alexander acknowledged the role of the papacy, then at its peak. He broadly accepted the papal interpretation of translatio imperii. In terms of the Church he was a reformer, looking for the end of simony.Charles T. Davis, Dante's Vision of History, Dante Studies, with the Annual Report of the Dante Society No. 93 (1975), pp. 143-160, at p. 155. Published by: Dante Society of America. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/40166193 Alexander utilised threefold divisions to lay down a social theory, of Western Christendom. There were three major \\"nations\\": French, German and Italians. The Church was sustained by sacerdotium (the clergy), imperium (the Empire), and studium (scholarship); the first and last of these were matched to Rome and Paris, respectively. There were three social classes: the common folk, the clergy and the military. In France public life was largely run by clergy; in Italy it was the common sort who predominated; while in Germany the soldiers (nobles) took the lead. Alexander was following Vincent of Beauvais, and then Martin von Troppau, in considering a translatio of studium to Paris, supposedly made by Charlemagne. Conceding both the religious authority of the Pope, and the (quite mythical) antiquity of the University of Paris, Alexander's style of argument allowed him to assert strongly the authority of the Empire, as German, in the field of imperium. The context was that the rising French monarchy was discounting the authority of the Emperor, and a real possibility it would claim imperium for itself. Works Alexander of Roes's major work was the Memoriale, comprising Memoriale de prerogativa Romani imperii with De translatio imperii (c.1281), of which he wrote the second only, following modern scholarship. It is suggested that work belongs to the period after the election of Rudolf von Habsburg, as King of the Romans; and was directly inspired by Alexander's experience of the election of Pope Martin IV. At that time Alexander was with the papal curia, and was employed as chaplain by Cardinal Giacomo Colonna. In the De translatio, Alexander brings up the Last World Emperor in a form adapted to a second Germanic Charlemagne. Incorporated was the De prerogativa Romani imperii, a treatise of Jordan of Osnabr√ºck on the legitimacy of the Roman Empire in its pagan period. Other works were: *Pavo (c.1285) (i.e. peacock), a parody in which a peacock represents the Pope. *Noticia seculi. Adopts from De semine scripturarum (c.1205) a prophecy on the recovery of Palestine and church reform by 1315. The work, of 1288, is dedicated to a Roman nobleman, not named, but thought to be Giacomo Colonna. Legacy The Memoriale, also in later manuscripts called Chronica, gave rise to the so- called \\"Magdeburg prophecy\\". Around 1280, when Alexander was writing, it was intended to bolster a claim by Charles of Anjou to become Holy Roman Emperor. Much later it was taken to apply to Emperor Charles V, in his time. It was alluded to, as from Magdeburg, by Johann Carion in his Chronica of 1533. It was given a new lease of life by its inclusion in the Lectiones memorabiles et reconditae (1600) of Johann Wolff, by Wolfgang Lazius, and by James Maxwell, who drew on a translation by Hermann Bonus. Maxwell applied it to the future Charles I of England. After Charles I's execution, William Lilly, who knew the prophecy from Maxwell's work, was concerned in Monarchy or No Monarchy (1651) to argue that it did not apply to \\"Charles II of Scotland\\".

Danziger (1909‚Äì1999) and Harry Lee Danziger (1913‚Äì2005) were American-born brothers who produced many British films and TV shows in the 1950s and 1960s. According to one profile \\"throughout the 1950s and early 1960s, their second features and TV series seemed to be on screens everywhere, their pervasive presence forming a part of virtually every British filmgoer's and television viewer's experience during those years.\\" Career Edward and Harry Danziger were native New Yorkers. Edward studied law and had worked on the Nuremberg Trials while brother Harry had a musical background. They operated a sound studio in New York that specialised in the dubbing of foreign films for US release. Their first feature film as producers was Jigsaw (1949). In 1952, they moved to Britain and began making television films, using resources at various facilities including London's Riverside Studios, Shepperton, Borehamwood and Nettlefold. Among their first productions was the series Adventure Theater (aka, Calling Scotland Yard) which were shown on American television in 1956. Several episodes were compiled as supporting featurettes and released theatrically in the UK during 1954. The screenwriter Brian Clemens worked for the Danzigers. He recalled that the Danzigers would shoot at a variety of British studios and order their writers to concoct a screenplay to use the standing sets. He stated they shot television episodes in two and a half to three days and shot a feature film in eight to ten days with a budget of ¬£17,000.Dixon, Wheeler W. Brian Clemens Interview in Collected Interviews: Voices from Twentieth-Century Cinema SIU Press, 2001, pp. 48-19 In 1956, the Danzigers decided to form their own studio base and founded the New Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire. They converted a former wartime aero-engine testing factory into a studio with six sound stages and exterior shooting facilities.Danzinger Studios - The Untold Elstree Story at Movie Gem Films They later acquired control of the Gordon Hotels Group and moved into the hotel business.

Daniel Glattauer (born May 19, 1960) is an Austrian writer and former journalist. He was born in Vienna, where he still lives and works. A former regular columnist for Der Standard, a national daily newspaper, he is best known for his dialogic epistolary novel Love Virtually (Gut gegen Nordwind) and its sequel Every Seventh Wave (Alle sieben Wellen). His literary works were translated into 40 languages, sold over 3 million times and adapted for radio, theater, television and cinema alike, even beyond the German speaking countries. In 2006 he was nominated for the German Book Prize (Deutscher Buchpreis) for his novel Love Virtually. Glattauer's novels and plays are inspired by his personal experiences, dealing with situations and themes constructed from memories of his time as a journalist and his psychosocial counsellor training. With him often being described as a \\"feel-good-author\\", Glattauer's work is characterized by humor and romantic relationships, catering to the masses and leading some critics to find fault with a lack of depth to his novels.  Biography = Early life, education and family  Glattauer was born in Vienna on May 19, 1960 and raised in Favoriten, the city's 10th district, where he also went to school at Neulandschule Laaerberg. In high school, at the age of 16, he started writing his first love poems and short stories that remain unpublished. For private use only he also wrote songs for the guitar. After graduating in 1978, he went on to study pedagogy and art history at the University of Vienna in 1979, where he also did his doctorate in 1985, writing his dissertation about \\"the evil in the upbringing\\". The same year, at the age of 25, he met Lisi, whom he married 20 years later. She brought her 5-year-old son, Thomas, into the relationship and they raised him together. Glattauer is not the only journalist and author in his family. Herbert O. Glattauer, his father, is a retired journalist and freelance writer, having published multiple books. He also wrote around 40 short stories under the pseudonym 'Oscar Hannibal Pippering', starring a private detective of the same name. Herbert Glattauer is currently working on his next novel. Daniel Glattauer's brother, Nikolaus, is a journalist, author and teacher in Vienna, having published books with a humorous take on education. Since the birth of Theo, Glattauer's nephew, Daniel documented his upbringing and maturing in short texts and interviews and further made him the topic of two books, \\"Theo und der Rest der Welt\\" (1997) and \\"Theo. Antworten aus dem Kinderzimmer\\" (2010). From 2010 to 2012 he did a five-semester-long diploma course at \\"ARGE Bildungsmanagement\\" to be a psychosocial counsellor.  Career  Following the completion of his studies, Glattauer worked as an editor for Die Presse, a national, daily newspaper, for about three years, before becoming a journalist for Der Standard, a few months after it was founded. There, he operated as court reporter and journalist as well as columnist, writing his columns about daily life under the acronym 'dag.' In 1998 he published \\"Bekennen Sie sich schuldig?\\", a collection of satirical texts from his time as a court reporter. This was followed by the anthologies of selected columns, \\"Ameisenerz√§hlung\\" in 2001, \\"Schauma mal\\" in 2009 and \\"Mama, jetzt nicht!\\" in 2011. After his first novels \\"Der Weihnachtshund\\" and \\"Darum\\" were successful in the German- speaking area, Glattauer's real breakthrough as a novelist happened in 2006, with Love Virtually. Since 2009 he is a freelance author, residing in Vienna and the 'Waldviertel', the northwestern region of Lower Austria with his wife Lisi Glattauer and five Indian runner ducks. In 2010 he was part of the jury of the short-story competition \\"Wortlaut\\" by the Austrian radio station FM4. Recently Daniel Glattauer and his wife, with the help of the winemaker Barbara √ñhlzeit, started tending to and producing their own wine. The 2015 vintage is named after his most successful novel, \\"Gut gegen Nordwind - Glattauers Gemischte S√§tze\\", and the 2016 batch is currently maturing.  Style  Glattauer's \\"elegant\\" and \\"light\\" style that characterizes most of his humorous prose are ascribed to the years of journalistic experience he gathered during his time as columnist at Der Standard. In an interview with the journalist Birgit Braunrath, Glattauer himself claims that his goal is first and foremost to \\"get across in the most authentic way possible\\" (\\"m√∂glichst authentisch r√ºberkommen.\\")  Inspiration and themes  Glattauer's first play \\"Die Wunder√ºbung\\" was inspired directly by the psychosocial counselling course he attended in 2010. It is a minimalistic play with three characters, a constantly fighting married couple and their couples therapist who resorts to unconventional methods to fix their relationship. Glattauer claims that \\"one always draws inspiration from experience\\" (\\"Man sch√∂pft immer aus dem Erlebten\\") and that he writes about what he knows. In an interview with the Austrian journalist Thomas Trenkler, he reveals that some of his works, such as the psychothriller Forever Yours (\\"Ewig dein\\") published in 2012, were inspired by his time as a court reporter, relying on trial proceedings of stalking cases he witnessed at the time. Even as a retired journalist he finds inspiration in newspapers. He stumbled across the idea for his novel \\"Geschenkt\\", two years prior to its publication in 2014, in a newspaper article reporting on an anonymous donation made for people in need in Braunschweig, Germany. This story itself was highly publicized at the time and referred to as \\"the miracle of Braunschweig\\" (\\"das Wunder von Braunschweig.\\")  Public reception = Public image  Since many of Glattauer's novels are centered around romantic relationships, he has acquired the image of a romance-novelist and someone who understands the opposite sex very well. The narrative of his works resonate with the masses, especially with women. In a review published in Die Presse, Anna-Maria Wallner admits that Glattauer writes \\"amusing dialogues\\" (\\"am√ºsante Dialoge\\") but simultaneously critiques him for having a too intense focus on romantic relationships in most of his novels. Consistent with Wallner's review, the phrase \\"feel-good-author\\" is used in various reviews and interviews, implying a lack of depth to his work. When confronted with this label, the author takes it lightly, responding that \\"rubbing people the wrong way is not his specialty\\" (\\"Anecken ist nicht meine Disziplin.\\")  Reception  At first Glattauer's reputation as a journalist hindered his success as an author in his home country. Austrian literary critics would think of him as a journalist whose hobby was writing books in his free time. As a result, there is a lack of domestic, analytical, literary reviews of his work, which offers and explanation for his relatively moderate success in Austria compared to Germany, where his works are strongly promoted. The German, self-employed bookseller Martin Gaiser states in a review of Love Virtually that Glattauer uses \\"trenchant and challenging\\" (\\"pointiert und anspruchsvoll\\") language, naming it as one of the reasons for the novel's success. Taking the roundabout way through Austria's neighboring country, the national reception of Glattauer's work, although delayed, was overall very good. The author himself believes that the reception in various countries most likely depends on the quality of the translation, stating that the Spanish version must be quite good with regard to the sales numbers in Spain.  Readership demographic  In an Interview with the journalist Herbert Lackner, Glattauer reveals that he always writes with an intended audience at the back of his mind. For instance, he imagined the readers of his novel \\"Darum\\" to be female, between the ages 30 and 40.  Adaptations of his work  Theater = On May 7, 2009, the theater adaptation of Love Virtually premiered at the \\"Theater in der Josefstadt\\". While Glattauer co-wrote the adaptation, the stage production was directed by Michael Kreihsl, starring Ruth Brauer-Kvam and Alexander Pschill in the lead roles. In the theater season of 2010/11 the adaptation had, tremendous success in the German-speaking countries, it's 374 performances only being topped by Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt's The Visit. Glattauer's play \\"Die Wunder√ºbung\\" premiered on January 22, 2015, shortly after he wrote it in 2014. = Film = Glattauer's novel \\"Der Weihnachtshund\\" was adapted for television in 2004. The movie, by the same name, was directed by the German producer Michael Keusch, starring Nadeshda Brennicke and Florian Fitz in the lead roles of Katrin and Max. Three years later, the Austrian screenwriter and director Harald Sicheritz produced Glattauer's \\"Darum\\" for the cinema. Neither the movie \\"Der Weihnachtshund\\" nor \\"Darum\\" were as successful as the theater versions of Glattauer's other novels. In 2010, the theater adaptation of Love Virtually premiered on national television. = Radio = Love Virtually was adapted for BBC Radio 4 by Eileen Horne. Produced by Clive Brill for Pacificus Productions, the abridged play starred Emilia Fox and David Tennant in the lead roles of Emmi Rothner and Leo Leike. The program was first broadcast at 2:15 p.m. on March 8, 2012 and ran for a week. Describing the play as \\"sharply written, funny and brilliantly played\\", Elisabeth Mahoney's review in the Guardian is representative of the show's overall positive public reception. Following the success of Love Virtually, on February 14, 2013, the adaptation of Every Seventh Wave was aired on BBC Radio 4 with Fox and Tennant voicing the protagonists once more.

Mda subsequently dedicated his fifth novel, The Madonna of Excelsior, to the golden bird painted by Father Frans Claerhout.2009\\\\. \\"Metamorphosis and Place\\". Parker, J, Tunkrova, L and Bakari, M. Google Books Claerhout died of pneumonia at age 87 in 2006. He died in his sleep after being admitted to a hospital in Bloemfontein. He led a solitary life and before his death, he lived at the St. Francis Catholic Mission in Tweespruit, Free State, a home for pensioned Catholic priests. Artistic style Claerhout had no formal art training but came from an artistic family, and had belonged to a local art society during his student years. Claerhout has been defined as an expressionist painter and his work referenced Flemish Expressionism especially the works of Constant Permeke, whose paintings, like Claerhout's, were concerned with agricultural labourers and the land they tend. Examples of his work, characterised by their warm colours, thick impasto paint, exaggerated forms, humour and compassion were exhibited widely in South Africa, as well as in Belgium, Canada, Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom. In 1958 he joined a group of painters, writers and art patrons who formed an art movement in the Free State, which became known as the Bloemfontein Group. He suffered a heart attack in 1979 while visiting Belgium and later that year he had bypass surgery in South Africa.

It is a mirrorless interchangeable lens camera (MILC), which has a smaller body form factor than a traditional DSLR while retaining the sensor size and features of an APS-C-sized model. It is targeted at professionals, experienced users, and enthusiasts. It replaced the NEX-6 and NEX-7. Review websites note that although the Œ±6000 uses a 24 MP sensor like the Sony NEX-7, the Sony Œ±6000 can also be seen as more of a replacement of the Sony NEX-6. In the Firmware version 1.10, an android subsystem was added. The sub system was used to run Sony's apps. At the time of its release, the Sony Œ±6000 was advertised featuring the \\"world's fastest autofocus\\" with lag of 0.06 second and 11 fps continuous shooting with tracking AF. Its MSRP is $700 with a 16‚Äì50 mm power-zoom kit lens f/3.5-5.6. Despite the announcement of an updated model in February 2016, the Œ±6300, Sony has said they will continue production of the Œ±6000. Sony Alpha ILCE-6000 APS-C-frame camera with body cap flash extended.jpeg Sony Alpha ILCE-6000 APS-C-frame camera rear screen tilted.jpg Sony Alpha ILCE-6000 APS-C-frame camera side screen tilted.jpeg Sony Alpha ILCE-6000 APS-C-frame camera side screen tilted max.jpeg  Compared to its predecessor, Sony NEX-6  The Sony Œ±6000 was released one and a half year later, and has a slightly different shaped body than the NEX-6. The Œ±6000's body silhouette is almost like a perfect rectangle. They use the same sensor size, but the Œ±6000 has a 24 megapixel resolution, which is a 50% higher resolution, than the 16 MP NEX-6. The alpha model has an extra phisycal control dial, compared to the NEX model. The newer model has a slightly faster burst rate (11 fps vs 10 fps) and has almost twice as many autofocus points (179 vs 99), which makes it a lot more capable of sports photography. The Œ±6000 also offers Near-field communication and smartphone remote control over Wi-Fi, which the NEX cannot do. The SD card slot supports UHS-I in the Œ±6000 whereas the NEX-6 doesn't support any UHS standards. But there is one aspect which is a bit indistinctive and better in the older model: The NEX-6 has a 63% higher resolution electronic viewfinder than the Œ±6000 (2,359,000 dots vs 1,440,000 dots)  Compared to its other predecessor, Sony NEX-7  The NEX-7 was introduced in 2011 and has a more rounded body, than the 3 years newer Œ±6000. They use the same, 24 MP image sensor, but the noise performance is better in the newer model, thanks to the better processor. It also offers a higher maximum sensitivity (25,600 vs 16,600). The biggest difference is the autofocus: The NEX-7 only has 25 focus points, the Œ±6000 has 179, so it's a lot more accurate and also faster. The burst rate is the same as the NEX-6 in the NEX-7, (10 fps), the Œ±6000 can shoot a tiny bit faster continuously (11 fps). Similarly to the NEX-6, there is no NFC, Wi-Fi remote control or UHS memory card support in the NEX-7, but the Œ±6000 has these features. The Alpha model is 56g lighter than the NEX. However, there is also one aspect, which the NEX-7 is clearly better, than its successor, and this is the fact, it has a microphone jack input, which is present in the NEX, but the Œ±6000 lacks it for some reason. In terms of buttons, they have a different layout, but there are the same dials and buttons on the two cameras. Popularity The Sony Œ±6000 proved to be an extremely popular camera. By early 2016, it was reported to be the best-selling interchangeable-lens camera in the over-US$600 price range as well as the best-selling mirrorless camera of all time. Firmware updates Firmware version 1.10, released on 30 October 2014, added faster start up time and support for the \\"Smart Remote Control\\" Play Memories application. Firmware version 1.20, released on 26 March 2015, improved images captured on new lenses and added a few minor enhancements. Firmware version 1.21, released on 6 April 2015, fixed an error in version 1.20 and improved lens performance. Firmware version 2.00, released on 16 June 2015, enabled video capture with the XAVC S codec to support high Bit Rates. Firmware version 3.10, released on 17 March 2016, optimized lens performance (applied to the lenses releasing after 2016 March). Firmware version 3.20, released on 26 July 2016, optimized lens performance (SEL-70200GM). Firmware version 3.21, released on 19 March 2019, improved stability of the AF operation. Mobile phone application update 2019 There is an application (Image Edge Mobile) which allows a user to control the Sony A6000-A6500 camera. The application also allows a user to transfer photos over wireless to the user's mobile phone.

He worked with his wife, Sylvia Agnes Sophia Tait from 1948 until her death in 2003, a partnership described by the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography as \\"one of the most successful examples of husband-wife collaboration.\\" Together, they discovered and identified the hormone aldosterone. Early life Tait was born in Stockton on Tees in 1926, the son of Herbert and Constance Tait (n√©e Brotherton). His parents ran a small grocery shop, but his father died when he was 10. Tait attended Darlington Queen Elizabeth 1 Grammar School, where he took Physics, Chemistry, Maths and English Literature for the Higher School Certificate. He went to Leeds University to read Physics, graduating in 1945. He joined Whiddington's research group at Leeds. completing his PhD thesis entitled The energy distribution of electrons in discharge tubes in 1947. Career Tait joined the department of medical physics at Middlesex Hospital Medical School, London, as a lecturer, where he started to work on adrenal steroids, building on work by Ralph Dorfman. They went on to discover a biologically active compound that they called electrocortin (later renamed aldosterone) in collaboration with Swiss chemist Tadeus Reichstein who had received the Nobel Prize for similar work on cortisol. The discovery was published in 1952. In 1958, the Taits moved to the Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, where they worked with Gregory Pincus. Tait developed mathematical methods to calculate hormone secretion rates from changes in the ratio of radioactively labelled to unlabelled hormone in urine. This developed into a new field of study ‚Äì hormone dynamics. Tait undertook periods of leave at the Physiology Department at the University of Melbourne in Australia and at the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health at UM. Following Pincus' death, Tait became joint chairman of the scientific council of the Worcester Foundation. In 1970, the Taits returned to the Middlesex Hospital as joint heads of the Biophysical Endocrinology Unit. Tait was also Joel Professor of Physics as Applied to Medicine. They worked on adrenal zona glomerulosa cells. The Taits retired in 1982 and moved to East Boldre where they continued their scientific research using two Apple IIe computers running in parallel. In 2003, a scientific meeting was organised in London to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the discovery of Aldosterone, but Sylvia died shortly beforehand and Tait was undergoing diabetes treatment in the Royal Bournemouth Hospital. Tait subsequently moved to Harrogate and continued his scientific interests and writing. He authored or co-authored over 150 scientific papers during his career.

The plot of the film bears similarities to The Dirty Dozen, although it was made five years before Robert Aldrich's film, and three years before the novel on which it is based.

In 2001, Nakamura and his colleagues of RIKEN SNP Research Center developed the methodology of Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS), and using this method his research gourp first discovered functional SNP in the lymphotoxin-Œ± gene that are associated with susceptibility to myocardial infarction in 2002, which was a breakthrough in the research field of medical genetics. Furthermore, the RIKEN SNP Research Center led by him made the largest contribution in the Phase 1 HapMap project of the International HapMap Consortium published in the scientific journal Nature in 2005. Nakamura has also focused on applying genetic information to improve the care of cancer patients, working to bring his laboratory's discoveries into the clinical practice. In 2001, his cancer research at the University of Tokyo led to the formation of OncoTherapy Science, a successful public Japanese biotechnology company that concentrates on new cancer therapies. Life and career Nakamura was born in Osaka, Japan on 8 December 1952. He received his medical degree in 1977 and his PhD in 1984 from Osaka University. While working as a surgeon in Japan, he witnessed a 27-year-old patient die of cancer, which affected him deeply. Then, to pursue advanced study in genetics and oncology, he went to the US and spent five years as a postdoctoral fellow and then as a faculty member at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute at the University of Utah, an international center for gene mapping. In 1989, Nakamura became Head of the Biochemistry Department, at the Cancer Institute, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research.Yusuke Nakamura MD PhD He was appointed as Professor at the Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo in 1994. When the Japanese government launched its Millennium Genome Project in 2000, he was named group leader for the genetic diversity program at the renowned RIKEN SNP Research Center. He also served as director of the RIKEN Center from 2005 to 2010, as well as Director of National Cancer Research Research Institute from 2010 to 2011. From January to December 2011, Nakamura was Special Advisor to the Cabinet Secretary General, Office of Medical Innovation, Cabinet Secretariat, Government of Japan. In 2012, Nakamura moved to the Department of Medicine at the University of Chicago in 2012 as Professor and Deputy Director, Center for Personalized Therapeutics In 2018, after becoming the Emeritus Faculty Professor of the University of Chicago and returning to Japan, he was appointed Director of Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program of Japanese Cabinet Office, as well as Director at the Cancer Precision Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research.

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange. History On the Beach's offices in Cheadle The company was founded by Simon Cooper, who began his career in the travel industry while attending university, when he founded a ski holiday company called On the Piste. He geared the business toward groups of students wanting to go on budget-friendly ski holidays to the French Alps by coach. Meanwhile, in 2004, Cooper started working on a new venture, On the Beach. When TUI Group's Thomson Holidays (since renamed TUI UK) purchased On the Piste in 2008, Cooper then directed his full attention to his new platform. In 2007, private equity investor Livingbridge acquired a majority stake in the company for ¬£36 million. In 2008, the company relocated to larger premises at Spectrum House on Towers Business Park in Didsbury, Manchester to house additional employees. In 2011 On the Beach expanded further by acquiring Resort Taxis out of administration for ¬£10,000 to assist with transporting holidaymakers in its most popular destinations of Egypt, Turkey, The Balearics, The Canaries, mainland Spain, Greece and The Algarve. The Resort Taxi arm was later re- branded into On the Beach Transfers in 2012. The company also continued to build on its services by founding On the Beach Beds in 2011. The self- contracted hotel organisation allowed On the Beach to contract directly with hotels, attempting to secure better rates for their customers and increase their market advantage. In January 2012, On the Beach launched its 24-hour resort support service, providing customers with points of contact within their resorts at some of their most popular destinations. By the end of 2012, On the Beach had relocated its headquarters to a new 17‚Äô500 square foot property in Cheadle, near Stockport. In October 2013, Livingbridge sold a majority stake in the business to Inflexion Equity Partners on the basis of an enterprise value of ¬£73 million. In January 2015, On the Beach expanded internationally by launching in Sweden under the domain name ebeach.se. In September 2015, On the Beach was floated on the London Stock Exchange, valued at ¬£240 million. In May 2017, On the Beach acquired rival online travel agent Sunshine.co.uk for a total cost of ¬£12 million. In November 2018, On the Beach opened its brand new digital headquarters at the Aeroworks building in Ancoats, Manchester.  Operations  On the Beach is headquartered in the Aeroworks building, Ancoats, Manchester. On 26 December 2013, On the Beach aired their first television advert. The ‚ÄòTotally Beachin Holidays‚Äô campaign, was filmed in Corralejo, Fuerteventura and was broadcast across the Midlands region on ITV and Channel 4.

Bruch wrote the work between 1875 and 1877 during the consolidation of the newly founded German Empire. He picked the story revolving around Arminius and the Cherusci- led defeat of three Roman legions in the Teutoburg Forest in 9 A.D., which served as a German national myth from the 16th to the early 20th century.Howard E. Smither, A History of the Oratorio: The oratorio in the nineteenth and twentieth Centuries, The University of North Carolina Press, p. 107.  History  Since the rediscovery of Tacitus's Germania in the 16th century, Germans have exalted the Germanic tribes as their direct ancestors. They especially praised German liberty defended by Arminius in 9 A.D. when three legions of the Roman Empire were defeated on Germanic soil, thus putting an end to Roman plans to subjugate Germania.Alexander Schmidt, Vaterlandsliebe Und Religionskonflikt: Politische Diskurse Im Alten Reich, Brill Publishers, p. 125. This national myth inspired several poets and composers, amongst others Georg Friedrich H√§ndel, Daniel Caspar von Lohenstein, Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock and Heinrich von Kleist, to dedicate their works to Arminius and to the battle that preserved German liberty.Ernst Baltrusch, Morten Hegewisch, Michael Meyer, Uwe Puschner, Christian Wendt (ed.). 2000 Jahre Varusschlacht: Geschichte ‚Äì Arch√§ologie ‚Äì Legenden, De Gruyter, p. 67. After the foundation of the German Empire in 1871, the interest in this story was renewed. The erection of the Hermannsdenkmal and the Hermann Heights MonumentErnst Baltrusch, Morten Hegewisch, Michael Meyer, Uwe Puschner, Christian Wendt (ed.). 2000 Jahre Varusschlacht: Geschichte ‚Äì Arch√§ologie ‚Äì Legenden, De Gruyter, p. 267. and the renaissance of general interest in Germanic culture (f.ex. in Richard Wagner's Ring tetralogy) took place during this era.  Scoring and structure  Arminius is an oratorio in four parts for 3 soloists (alto, tenor, baritone), choir and orchestra. # I. Introduction # II. In the Sacred Grove # III. The Revolt # IV. The Battle Performed, the work approximately takes 90 minutes.  Introduction  :\\"Wir sind des Mars gewalt'ge S√∂hne, aus G√∂tterkraft gezeugt sind wir! Vor unsern Waffen sanken der Erde stolze Reiche, wie Throngebilde brachen sie in Staub zusammen.\\" ‚Äî :\\"We are the sons of Mars the mighty, from Gods and heroes have we sprung! Before our arms unconquer'd the tribes of earth lie prostrate, they break asunder, like to moulds of clay, we crush them, they break asunder.\\"Both the German libretto and the English translation thereof: Booklet, Max Bruch. Arminius. NDR 1 Niedersachsen. In the Introduction,Barbara Eichner, History in Mighty Sounds: Musical Constructions of German National Identity, p. 172‚Äì181. the Roman legions approach the camp of Arminius and the Cheruski who express their will to not longer accept Roman tyranny: \\"But now your conqu'ring arms shall fail you, your star of glory here shall pale and die! We freeborn sons of Wodan, we have not learnt to bend to the stranger's yoke!\\" (\\"Doch hier ist ihrer Herrschaft Grenze, hier wird erbleichen ihres Ruhmes Stern! Wir, Wodans freie S√∂hne, wir beugten nie den Nacken dem fremden Joch!\\")  In the Sacred Grove  :\\"Ihr G√∂tter, Walhallas Bewohner, o neiget euch gn√§dig uns! Erh√∂ret, erhabene M√§chte, des Volkes Fleh'n!\\" ‚Äî :\\"Ye Gods, dwelling high in Valhalla, oh, graciously hear us call! Ye heed us, ye mighty immortals, your people pray!\\" The second part of the oratorio introduces the listener to a sacred forest where the chorus and a priestess call the gods of heathen Germania to help them withstand.  The Revolt  :\\"O dass ich k√ºnden muss meines Volkes Schmach! Allvater, m√§cht'ger, z√ºrnest du?\\" ‚Äî :\\"Oh! Must I live to tell of my people's shame! Wodan, Allfather, art thou wroth?\\" The insurrection actually begins. Arminius muses about the past when the Germanic tribes lived peacefully in their homes, posing no threat whatsoever to the mighty Roman Empire which nonetheless started to \\"pour[] upon our valleys\\", thus breaking the peace. Siegmund roams the area after having killed a Roman soldier who had insulted his wife. Deeply shattered by Siegmund's faith illustrating Roman tyranny, Arminius calls everyone to arms: \\"To arms! for just is our cause! Ranged in order, brothers all!\\" (\\"Zum Kampf! zum Kampf! zum heiligen Kampf schart euch, ihr tapfern Streiter all!\\").  The Battle  :\\"Gro√ü ist der Ruhm der deutschen S√∂hne, gro√ü die Ehre der gefallenen Helden!\\" ‚Äî :\\"Germany's sons shall be renowned, great and glorious are the heroes who have fallen!\\" The fierce battle is accompanied by renewed prayers to the Germanic gods who shall guide the warriors: \\"Freya, gracious mother, awful one, bounteous giver of blessings, look down on our warriors brave, oh protect them! Thousands are wounded, their blood is flowing, pour'd for their fatherland!\\" (\\"Hehre Mutter, Freya, g√∂ttliche, freudenspendende Mutter, o schirme der J√ºnglinge sch√∂ne Jugend! Sieh, wie sie bluten aus tausend Wunden, bluten f√ºrs Vaterland!\\") Siegmund, fatally wounded, hears how \\"Allfather rides upon his steed of storm\\". The oratorio ends with Arminius and the choir praising Wodan and singing paeans: \\"[W]e will chant a solemn song to Freedom, glorious treasure!\\" (\\"[Wir] singen der Freiheit hehres Lied, der goldenen und s√º√üen Freiheit!\\")  See also  * Hermann und Thusnelda  References  External links  * Arminius on Amazon * Information about Arminius on AllMusic * The chorus of the Romans on YouTube. * Arminius's call to arms on YouTube.

The development of the Eastern Railway through Perth created a large yard and railway station area that divided the city of Perth from its adjacent northern streets. The first railway bridge at Barrack Street was timber, and in repair on a regular basis. It was demolished in 1894.

It lost its dominance in the landscape with the construction of the multi story car park adjacent to the west, in the late 20th century.

Constable. p77 It occupies the site of the Battle of Inverurie (1308), in which Robert Bruce defeated John Comyn, Earl of Buchan. History A castle on this site was, from the mid-13th century, the seat of the King family. An earlier castle associated with the hereditary Forester and Coroner of the Garioch, a Blackhall, may be incorporated in the main block and south-eastern wing, but the present castle owes its form mainly to George Seton, chancellor of the University of Aberdeen, Tutor and Vicar of Meldrum who was granted the estate in 1598. A charter of 1599 to George Seton, tutor of Meldrum, mentions the erection of the lands of Barra as a free barony, while a charter of 1615, ordains that the 'fortalice of Barra' is to be the chief seat of the barony. James Reid, an Aberdeen advocate, was in possession of the estate by 1630, and the Reid family retained it until 1754. Dame Margaret Abercrombie, the wife of John Reid (who was made a baronet in 1703), refitted parts of the house; she may be responsible for the fireplace in the Great Hall. The purchaser in 1754 was John Ramsay of Melrose, a merchant trading in Russia, who added the north wing, and his descendants still own it; a Ramsay heiress married Andrew Irvine, one of the Irvines of Drum, early in the 20th century. John Ramsay preferred his estate at Straloch, and after his death in 1787 the property came to be used as a farmhouse. It was restored as a dower house, to plans by George Bennet Mitchell, in the first decade of the twentieth century. Structure Barra Castle The plan of the castle is an unusual variation on the L-plan, with the main block of the castle lying north to south. There is a circular tower at the south-west. A D-plan tower at the south-east contains the main stair and entrance. This tower, corbelled square at the top to give a watch-room, links to a large square wing. At its north-west angle this wing has a second circular tower. The castle‚Äôs entrance is in the main re-entrant angle. The towers have conical roofs. Running eastward from the north end of the main block there is an addition, dating from the 18th century. A wall to the east, which contains the entrance, forms the fourth side of a square court. The buildings around the courtyard are three storeys high, built of pinned boulder rubble. The main gables are crow stepped. The drawing room, which is panelled, has a large chimneypiece, with a later one inserted in it. The first floor bedroom in the South East wing has panelling dating from the early to mid-18th century. There is a panelled sitting room in the North wing. The castle is a category A listed building and is constructed on the site of Robert the Bruce's successful battle against John Comyn, Earl of Buchan in 1308. The Hunterian Museum in Glasgow has a hammerstone from Barra Castle.

The film co-stars Sally Yeh, Joey Wong, Waise Lee, Carrie Ng and Kent Cheng as the police inspector. Plot The film begins with a comedic narration done by the leading man whom, in a brief introduction calls himself Chow Ting-fat (Chow Yun-fat). He dreamed of becoming wealthy and successful, which also includes marrying beautiful ladies at once. The scene roles to the part where Chow inevitably shields himself from heavy rainfall due to the broken down of his car. There, he met two beautiful women named Joey (Joey Wong), a boutique owner and Sally (Sally Yeh), an air-hostess whom he later marries (with Joey in America and Sally in Paris) who does not know about Chow's two timing marriage. As time goes by, Chow thought that his dreams came true, so he decides to be a two timing bigamist by making himself a schedule of timetables; in which he could spend his time carefully and comfortably with his wives without being noticed. His personal life is imperishable until one day, when Sally decide to fly back to Hong Kong to give Chow an early birthday surprise celebration; thus, spoiling his scheduled time planned for Joey's visit. Chow then enlisted the help of his best friend and partner Chi-hung (Waise Lee) for every single emergency backup. They scripted numerous sign languages and indirect excuses to prevent the wives from knowing that Chow is a definite bigamist. Many of their plans worked out well, but that doesn't stop the worse of the worse from uncovering the truth. First, Chow was unfortunate that he had an accident with a police Inspector Cheng (Kent Cheng) which it resulted him being sent to the hospital for an emergency treatment. He narrowly escapes both his wives' awareness and eventually, he has chosen to follow Sally as she reaches the hospital first before Joey's arrival; avoiding her detection. Meanwhile, after hearing both women pleading to look for the same patient, the Inspector that Chow had met earlier in the accident begin to suspect about the relationship between him (Chow) and the women. Chi-hung was eventually dragged into pretending as Chow which he managed to block every single questions asked by the inspector, saying that he is indeed one of the many Chows located in Hong Kong. Convinced, the inspector left without a clue after misleadingly thought that Joey is crazy despite Chi Hung's lies. Chow's nightmare paced up when the coincidence of both wives becoming good friends occurred at Joey's Boutique and later on at the hair salon. Joey decides to throw a personal birthday party for her and Chow while Sally accompanies him to her house. Chi-hung was once again called to the rescue, but this time Chow managed to intervene the situation by mixing up Sally's suspicion; saying that Chi-hung is his best friend and Joey's \\"husband\\". Chow once again narrowly escaped being suspected as a bigamist through:(Chi-hung's just in time arrival & purposely by having his face slammed on the birthday cake written with caption of \\"Joey Love Fat\\". He told Joey that the police Inspector Cheng is a psychopath in order to prevent her and Sally from being further questioned; Chow also scares Cheng off by pretending to be Chi-hung's gay partner; leading him to believe that they are gays). With Chow's constant avoidance, Chi-hung suffered a hilariously overburdened depression. This eventually led to his jealous colleague and girlfriend Ka-lai's (Carrie Ng) attention, who thinks that her boyfriend is having an affair with some other women. Tensions and nervousness begin to lubricate to its peak when every invitations occur in a restaurant with all Chow, his wives, Chi-hung and Ka-lai meeting up together at the same time. Sally and Joey made good friends with Ka-lai, whereas Chow even ridiculously told Joey that he must pretend to be Sally's lover, so as Chi Hung being forced to pretend as Ka-lai's lover(in which both wives timidly believing that their husband's act is by helping Chi Hung getting off his peril, once again wiping out Ka-lai's suspicion). During their first year wedding anniversary, Sally and Joey ended up bumping onto each other again coincidentally (also with Ka-lai around) in a photo shop, and there the ladies finally discovered that their husband was all along a two timing bigamist via the display of their wedding albums; both with Chow as their husband (with Sally's in Paris, France and Joey's in America ). Angry and desperate, the ladies purposely planned a vacation for the men where they are brought to a hotel for their valentine celebration. Unaware about the wives' intention, Chow was surprised to see that he was on a bed with both women tied up left and right next to him. Chow once again calls up Chi Hung to his aid, taking the risk crossing over to Chow's room by climbing out his. The plan was an epic failure; with Chow being fooled by his pretended to drunk wives and tied up on bed, where both Sally and Joey taking their own sweet time teaching their man a lesson (which includes him being slapped, beaten by thugs, squeezing an orange to his mouth, strips him naked and lighting up the hotel room's fire distinguishing system; making him cold and wet before both of them sadly leaving him for good). After a failed attempt to woo back his wives, Chow decided to chase them back from leaving Hong Kong. The wives didn't left but instead, optimistically discussed among themselves who should be Chow's one and only love as he could only choose one by the right of law. Coincidentally unaware that the police forces (led by Inspector Cheng) are having a tactical strike out against two criminals, with one being (Shing Fui-On), the arrival of Chow and his wives (near the location they first met) alerted the criminals who later on held both wives as hostages under the police's surroundings. The wives exaggeratedly gone rage and beats up the two criminals after witnessing that their husband is being shot in the arm (which the incident includes the ladies purportedly snatching off the criminals' pistols and clumsily pulling the triggers at them - with bullets hilariously missing them in the process). Afraid to lose their lives under the ladies mere clumsiness, the criminals then voluntarily and willingly surrendered themselves to the police, which the coincidental accident has unpredictably eased up the inspector and his team. Before the film ends, Chow apologizes to wives under a heavy rain and stated that it is better for them to live on without him; thus, sending them home by calling a taxi, with both of them sadly looking at him before he walks away from the rain. Trivia The post credit scene shows Chow Ting-fat chanting ancient prayers (seemingly in Middle Eastern attire) and together with him are two women who turns out to be Sally and Joey in their respective Middle Eastern traditional attires as well. It is purportedly believed that Chow and his wives had converted into Middle Eastern religion, which explains that they are happily married. Chi-hung then appears in business suit, bringing four of his wives with one being a funny upset looking Ka-lai as his fourth wife before the film ends entirely.

It is classified as one of the Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases (i.e. EBV+ LPD). Presentation The most common symptoms of CAEBV include: * Fever * Hepatitis * Pancytopenia * Spleen enlargement * Hypersensitivity to mosquito bites Complications include: * Interstitial pneumonia * Lymphoma, including B-cell, T-cell and NK-cell lymphomas * Haemophagocytic syndrome * Coronary artery aneurysms * Liver failure * Nasopharyngeal carcinoma * Gastric adenocarcinoma * CNS * Intestinal perforation * Myocarditis * Peripheral neuropathy Pathophysiology It arises from the cells that constitute the immune system, most often the T-cells and NK cells in Asians/South Americans and the B-cells in the other racial groups. Various cytokine anomalies have been reported in people with CAEBV, examples include: * IL-1Œ≤ ‚Üë (elevated) * IL-4 ‚Üë * IL-6 ‚Üë * IL-10 ‚Üë * IL-12 ‚Üë * IL-13 ‚Üë * IL-15 ‚Üë * TNF ‚Üë * IFN-Œ≥ ‚Üë There is also evidence supporting a role for TGF-Œ≤ in the disease. Those that develop the haemophagocytic syndrome often exhibit an abnormally high amount of IL-1Œ≤ and IFN-Œ≥. DiagnosisTreatment The only known cure for CAEBV is allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), with all other treatment options (rituximab, cytotoxic chemotherapy and immunosuppressive therapy) being nothing more than stopgaps. Prognosis Without HSCT the condition is inevitably fatal and even HSCT is no guarantee, with a significant portion of patients dying from the disease progression. Factors indicative of a poor prognosis include: thrombocytopenia, late onset of the disease (age ‚â• 8 years) and T cell involvement.

Biography  Jochen Mannhart studied Physics at the University of T√ºbingen, Germany, from 1980 to 1986, where he also received his PhD in 1987 and his habilitation in 1994. From 1987 to 1989, he was a visiting scientist at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, NY. From 1989 to 1996, he was a Research Staff Member at the IBM Zurich Research Laboratory, where he was manager of the New Materials and Heterostructures research group. From 1996 to 2011, he was a chaired professor at the Center for Electronic Correlations and Magnetism at the University of Augsburg, Germany. Since the summer of 2011, he has been a director of the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, where he is head of the Solid State Quantum Electronics department.  Prizes and awards  The 2014 European Physical Society Condensed Matter Division Europhysics Prize is awarded to Jochen Mannhart. He was the 2008 recipient of the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Society, DFG), award endowment 2.5 million euros, for his research in the field of experimental solid-state physics. In 1986, he received the Friedrich F√∂rster Prize of the University of T√ºbingen, Germany.  Research  Mannhart‚Äôs research includes the fabrication of novel all-oxide field-effect transistors, in which phase changes can be switched at interface layers, including phase changes to superconductivity. Under his leadership, his research group has developed an improved scanning probe microscope (frequency-modulated lateral force microscopy), which features a resolution of 77 picometers. With this instrument, his group succeeded in imaging individual atoms with subatomic resolution, which was used, for example, to investigate the atomic mechanism of friction. With P. Chaudhari and D. Dimos, J. Mannhart revealed that grain alignment is key to the fabrication of high-temperature superconductors with useful critical currents, so that they are suitable for practical applications such as modern high-Tc superconducting cables. Another research area is thermoelectronic generators.  Key Publications  * Li, L., C. Richter, S. Paetel, T. Kopp, J. Mannhart, and R.C.

History Characterized by lengthy travel times and winding tracks in attractive landscapes, the narrow gauge railways of Sardinia have always attracted the attention of travellers. As early as 1921, the British writer D. H. Lawrence, in his book, Sea and Sardinia, recounted his experiences while traveling along the Cagliari‚ÄìIsili line: After World War II, railway tourism slowly took shape on the island. By the 1980s, the then concessionaires of the secondary lines, the (FCS) and the (SFS), were forced to organise a service for tourists in a more systematic fashion. The name chosen for it, Trenino Verde, was used for the first time in 1984, and alludes to the many features rich in vegetation encountered by the trains. Isili-Sorgono Line between Aritzo and Belv√¨ Given the growing demand for rail tourism, the Ferrovie della Sardegna (FdS) (created in 1989 from the merger of the FCS and the SFS), with the support of (ESIT), the World Wide Fund for Nature, and Italia Nostra, later obtained funding from the Region and the European Union to achieve a leap in the quality of the service. The funding was spent on the restoration of steam locomotives, vintage carriages, stations and sections of line. On 10 May 1995, 14 years after its closure, the restored was reopened to rail traffic, in the form of Trenino Verde services, thus becoming the first tourist-train-only line in Sardinia. Two years later, on 16 June 1997, four of the FdS lines, the , the , the and the , were closed to ordinary traffic and converted to tourist train lines. Additionally, two themed museums were opened as part of the Trenino Verde project, on premises adjacent to the and Tempio Pausania railway stations. In 2010, with the integration of ARST Gestione FdS (the name assumed by the FdS in 2008) into the ARST, the latter company inherited responsibility for the management of Sardinia's narrow gauge railways, including those of the Trenino Verde. Lines The Trenino Verde currently operates over the following long network of lines used exclusively for tourism purposes: Cagliari division * () * () Sassari-Macomer division * () * () These lines are used all year round for chartered trains, operating customised itineraries.

History A hermitage was constructed on the site in the 15th century, dedicated to S√£o Bento, by order of D. Est√™v√£o de Aguiar, then abbey of Alcoba√ßa. It was offered to Queen Elizabeth as a wedding gift, destined to the founding of the Congrega√ß√£o de C√≥negos de S√£o Salvador (Congregation of the Deacons of S√£o Salvador) of Vilar de Frades. Following the death of the Queen in 1461, King D. Afonso V executed the construction of the convent (honouring her last testament), installing in the place a community of clergy dedicated to C√≥negos Regrantes de S√£o Jo√£o Evangelista (Secular Canons of St. John the Evangelist) from Loio. The Queen had wanted to erect a hospice to shelter the Bons Homens de Vilar, of the Congregation of L√≥ios from the locale of Xabregas, where there existed a small hermitage dedicated to S√£o Bento, erected by the friars of Alcoba√ßa during the reign of King John I. On 9 March, a papal bull from Pope Pious II authorized the creation of the convent, which was eventually supported financially by Queen Leonor. The convent was recognized, until the end of the 16th century, as the Convent of S√£o Bento de Enxobregas. Between 1570 and 1602 (the Philippine dynasty), it was inhabited by Father Ant√≥nio da Concei√ß√£o, who was responsible for collecting the necessary financial stipends for the construction of the new church and improve the building. Following legend, the friar was able to construct a sumptuous convent with few monetary resources, which expanded his fame. Later beatified in the 18th century, he was linked to the local toponymy (the site of Beato Ant√≥nio or Convent of Beato), giving rise to the name Convento do Beato Ant√≥nio (Convent of Blessed Ant√≥nio). In 1633, construction of convent's new chapel was completed. At the beginning of the 16th century, D. Joana de Noronha, daughter of the second Counts of Linhares ordered the construction of a presbytery for the convent, that was destined as space to house the pantheon of the Linhares countship. This project was terminated in 1622. Through the donations of D. Joana de Noronha she was able to transfer the ossuary of her brother, who had perished in Ceuta on 29 April 1553. By the mid 17th century, the convent was receiving 2000 cruzados of land rents, supporting a congregation of 37 clerics and 26 servants. Public work on the convent persisted in 1697, resulting in the construction of the cloister and staircase. Following the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the building registered some damage, but many of the clergy abandoned the convent, resulting in the many of its treasurers being transferred to other religious buildings, including tombs. The spaces were occupied by a Royal Military Hospital. But, by the end of the century, what little remained in the convent, of an artistic value, was destroyed following a fire that gutted the building. In 1834, the church was sacked, with many of the religious reliquary removed from the temple, consequently resulting in the transfer of the parish seat from the church to the old Convent of Grilos. Having withstood the 1755 earthquake, it was destroyed by fire at the end of the 18th century. The kitchen, dining room and the novitiate were the only sections that survived the destruction. With the extinction of the religious orders in 1834, the church was looted, resulting in the loss of many of carved ornaments, paintings and liturgical vessels. Around this time a fire consumed the old church and part of the convent complex. It was then purchased by industrialist Jo√£o de Brito, who established a steam-powered milling factory to produce bread and cookies, in addition to a carpentry shop. By 1845, the rest of the convent was occupied by a tobacco factory, and much later, the Companhia Industrial de Portugal e Col√≥nias (Industrial Company of Portugal and the Colonies). By the beginning of the 20th century the church spaces were transformed into silos for cereals. A project to recuperate the old convent began in 1948, under the direction of Porf√≠rio Pardal Monteiro, that persisted until 1952. General repairs were performed in 1983, and later in 1990, in context of the Expo 98 Caminhos do Oriente exposition, that included the restoration of the cloister. In November 1998, a risk assessment study was carried out by the DGEMN. A year later it was acquired by the Cerealis group. On 28 July 2004, a fire destroyed the covering over the staircase and part of the old conventual dependencies. The new temple of Mannerist and Baroque architecture, was classified as a property of public interest. On the evening of 28 July 2004 a fire damaged the building, destroying about 70% of the building, including covered staircase and old conventual dependencies. Restoration of the building was completed in May 2005. Since the late twentieth century building has been used for cultural events and social causes. The German band Scorpions had three concerts, based on their 2001 live album (Acoustica) in Convento do Beato. Architecture The building comprises a rectangular plan that includes the old church and the primitive conventual dependencies, forming a \\"U\\" around the cloister. It includes differentiated wings, covered in tiled roofs. To the south is the old church, which is preceded by a long courtyard. The three-register, square church facade is marked by a ground floor rounded portico, surmounted by oculus and flanked by rectangular windows. A frieze creates a transition to the second floor, that has five rectangular, symmetrical windows. The final floor, is preceded by cornice, but only includes a central oculus. The interior consists of a single nave, subdivided in height by a 19th-century iron structure, with ten lateral chapels, inscribed transept and deep chancel. The early monastic complex is marked by its two-floor high cloister and full marble stonework, covered by a metallic structure. In each wing there are seven round arches topped by rectangular bay windows. The refectory includes a rectangular space, covered by a vault in depressed arch. In the lateral wall are six windows, where there are visible traces of the original late 16th century albarradas- type tile. The staircase leading to the upper floor, flows from an accessible areas by three vaulted arches in two straight sections, that come together at an intermediate level. It is flanked by semi-recessed rails on the walls. In the upper atrium are four doors with protruding pads and marble framing.

Basically the vibro-compression vacuum technology, used by Bretonstone system, consists of blending the natural aggregate of stone with a polymer mix (usually unsaturated polyester resin), taking away air with a vacuum, and catalyzing the molded product whilst vibrating and applying pressure to this mix. Then the mixture is heated, and the output is a slab of non-porous and quite stable engineered stone. The following improvements led the agglomerated stone to obtain the same hardness as granite, when siliceous stone or quartz were added in the mix. The agglomerate produced with the Bretonstone system looks like natural stone and varies in look according to the types of stone aggregates and stone- like materials used in the process: * granite-looking * one-color * veined marble * today also ‚Äúexotic granite‚Äù effect * with colored glass inserts * with crystal fragments * with mirrors pieces * with semi-precious stones * with brass filings  References  External links  * Official Website Category:Industrial processes ","title":"Bretonstone"},{"id":"41921325","text":"Yelanka () is a rural locality (a selo), one of two settlements, in addition to Ulakhan-An, in Malzhagarsky 2-y Rural Okrug of Khangalassky District in the Sakha Republic, Russia.

Ertl's research into vaccine has taken a different approach from conventional wisdom, combining parts of different viruses that pose no harm to humans but still stimulate an immune response. In 2007, Ertl helped create The Wistar Institute Vaccine Center. She has served as its director since its inception. Ertl said that the vaccines the laboratories in the center are developing \\"have important implications for public health because they can reduce disease and death from very common infections. Additionally, she said that she wants to make existing vaccines more accessible in developing areas such as Africa and Asia. In interviews, Ertl has been cautious and critical when it comes to the development of vaccines for AIDS. Her research has shown that the vaccine may exhaust key cells of the immune system that are needed to fight the virus.

The line is under the administrative jurisdiction of Northern Railway. History The long wide broad gauge Amritsar‚ÄìPathankot line was opened in 1884. It originally belonged to the local government and was transferred to North Western Railway in 1892. The Amritsar-Dera Baba Nanak branch line serves the western part of Batala tehsil. Prior to the partition of India in 1947, this line was long and was linked to Sialkot (now in Pakistan), but after partition Dera Baba Nanak became the terminus. The Batala-Qadian link serves the eastern part of Batala tehsil. The long Amritsar-Sialkot line ran thus: Amritsar-Dera Baba Nanak- Narowal-Sialkot, crossing the long Ravi River Bridge. As of 2013, the Lahore- Narowal-Sialkot railway line passes near the India-Pakistan border through the western outskirts of Narowal, just opposite Dera Baba Nanak, before turning north-westwards to Pasrur and Sialkot. During the 2015 Gurdaspur attack, disaster was averted on this line as a railway lineman, Ashwani Saini, noticed a bomb on the track and alerted the authorities before the next train arrived. He also ran down the line waving a red flag to alert the driver of the next train to stop. The train that was due to traverse this track, with more than 270 people on board, stopped only a hundred yards from the bomb. Importance This line is strategically very important. It connects three border districts of Punjab with each other namely Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Pathankot. This lines provides a diversion or substitute route to Jalandhar- Jammu line. Whenever this track gets interrupted either due to farmers protest or due to any technical/mechanical work, then most of the trains get diverted via Amritsar-Gurdaspur to Pathankot and further to Jammu and vice versa. This line can also play a strategic role and help Military movement in war conditions. The important stations on this line are Amritsar, Batala, Gurdaspur & Pathankot. Other landmark stoppages are Verka, Dhariwal and Dinanagar. Railway workshop Amritsar railway workshop carries out periodic overhaul of WDS-4 locos and breakdown cranes and bogie manufacture. Passenger movement Amritsar is the only station on this line which is amongst the top hundred booking stations of Indian Railway. Railway reorganisation Sind Railway (later reorganised as Sind, Punjab and Delhi Railway) was formed a guaranteed railway in 1856. It constructed broad gauge railways from Delhi to Multan via Lahore, and from Karachi to Kotri. Multan and Kotri were connected by ferry service on the Indus River. In 1871-72, Indus Valley Railway was formed to connect Multan and Kotri. At the same time, Punjab Northern State Railway started constructing from Lahore towards Peshawar. In 1886, Sind, Punjab and Delhi Railway was acquired by the state and amalgamated with Indus Valley Railway and Punjab Northern State Railway to form North-Western State Railway. With the partition of India in 1947, North Western Railway was split. While the western portion became Pakistan West Railway, and later Pakistan Railways, the eastern part became Eastern Punjab Railway. In 1952, Northern Railway was formed with a portion of East Indian Railway Company west of Mughalsarai, Jodhpur Railway, Bikaner Railway and Eastern Punjab Railway.

Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1996.  Career  Cuthbert served as dean of women at Talladega College from 1927 to 1930, and from 1928 to 1931, she completed a master's in psychology at Columbia University during the summers. She got her PhD from Columbia Teacher's College in 1942. Cuthbert turned down Charles S. Johnson's offer to teach at Fisk University in favor of a position at Brooklyn College, where she worked from 1944 to 1961 and where was the first black woman to serve as dean of women. In an oral history, Olivia Pearl Stokes mentions Dr. Cuthbert was considered for presidency of Spelman College. After Cuthbert retired to Plainfield, NH, she authored numerous volumes of poetry, children's books, and short stories, some of which are anthologized.  Research  Dr. Cuthbert's research on black female college graduates, represented in her work Education and Marginality: A Study of the Negro College Graduate, fills a vacuum in literature about the experiences of black college graduates during the 1930s and 1940s. Her work complements that of Charles S. Johnson's study The Negro College Graduate published in 1938. Her dissertation focused on the experiences of black females at the intersection of race, gender and culture in context of college attainment. She conducted a comparative survey study of the experiences of black females who attained a college degree against those who never attended. Martin D. Jenkins critiques her work by claiming that while the focus on black females in college is critical, her methodology is not strong enough to make the work generalizable to the black experience.

The substance of the novel consists of the nocturnal reunion of one hundred brothers in the library of their ancestral home, as they attempt to locate and inter the ashes of their deceased father, an insane monarch, drink heavily, and manifest a variety of mildly homicidal sibling rivalries. The novel was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award in 1998. In his introduction to the novel, Jonathan Franzen wrote, \\"The Hundred Brothers is possibly the strangest novel ever published by an American. Its author, Donald Antrim, is arguably more unlike any other living writer than any other living writer.\\"  Plot summary  In the book's opening sentence Antrim names all ninety-nine of the brothers who have come together for drinks and dinner, bad masculine behavior, and avoidance of the work of giving their father's funeral ashes a proper burial. This opening sentence also contains the book's first and last reference to a particular woman, Jane, who is responsible for the disappearance of the hundredth brother. \\"It's as if, according to the novel's logic, the mere naming of a Significant Other is enough to exclude a brother from the narrative.\\" The story takes place in the enormous library of the family's ancestral mansion, from the window of which the campfires of homeless people can be seen in the \\"forlorn valley\\" outside the property's walls, and the action is confined to a single night, punctuated here and there by glimpses of the family's history of brother-on-brother cruelty and violence. The incidents that occur on this single night are often farcical, often frustrating to the story's narrator, Doug‚Äîwho is one of the hundred brothers‚Äîand an intense, vivid specificity is maintained throughout the narrative. \\"Taken together [the episodes] amount to a feat of choreography, in which Doug, the self-appointed Corn King, is the lead dancer who engages all the others as he makes his way around the library.\\" Style A plurality of critics responding to The Hundred Brothers mention Antrim's rigorous control over the narrative. The novel is a feat of exclusion and inclusion. Excluded from the narrative are: women (including the mother or mothers of the hundred brothers), children, any reference to a particular place or year, any realistic accounting of how there came to be so many brothers, how they fit into a single house, and what their lives outside of the house are like. Within these confines, however, can be found \\"a remarkably complete catalog of the things that men do and feel among men\\":Football, fisticuffs, food fights, chess playing, bullying gambling, hunting, drinking, pornography, pranking, philanthropy, power tools, homosexual cruising, anxieties about incontinence, penis size and middle-age weight gain. \\"The book also, despite its brevity, contains a deftly telecoped genealogy of human knowledge and experience, reaching from pre-history up through a very belated present day in which civilization seems on the brink of collapse.\\" References Category:American magic realism novels Category:Postmodern novels Category:PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction-winning works ","title":"The Hundred Brothers"},{"id":"41921515","text":"James Joseph Gerrard (June 9, 1897 ‚Äì June 3, 1991) was a bishop of the Catholic Church in the United States.

It is commonly found in Pima County, Arizona although it is also found throughout New Mexico and as far east as Texas. Etymology The generic name Coryphantha is derived from the Greek-- coryphe=\\"head\\", anthos=\\"flower\\"; that is to say the plant with a flower on its head. Robustispina means robust spines and needles. Taxonomy Coryphantha robustispina was described by (Schott ex Engelm) Britton & Rose and published in The Cactaceae, descriptions and illustrations of plants of the cactus family. 4:33, 1923 Subspecies: Coryphantha robustispina; coryphantha - subspecies sheeri; coryphantha robustispina, uncinata; Description Pima pineapples in Pima County, Arizona. Coryphantha robustispina grows mostly solitarily with an ovoid shape. It has a clean greyish-greenish color and reaches 5‚Äì9 cm tall and 5‚Äì15 cm in diameter although larger plants are frequently found. The areolas are oval or cylindrical in shape with a deep furrow and one or two nectar glads. It has 1-4 central spines curved or hooked. They are white or grey with the tip being darker. They measure between 1 and 5 cm in length. The 6-16 radial spines are off-white between 1 and 3 cm in length. Their flowers are golden yellow, pale green or opaque yellow. The seed pods are cylindrical and green up to 5 cm. Distribution and habitat Coryphantha robustispina is found in Arizona, New Mexico and Texas in the United States. It also is in Mexico in the states of Chihuahua and Sonora. It is rare. It is on the Federal Endangered Species list. Ecology Coryphantha robustispina has a complicated life cycle: 1) It flowers after a monsoon rain, usually in July. 2) A certain type of bee fertilizes it a couple of days later since the flowers only last a short time. 3) The pods must be eaten by a jack rabbit, though not a cottontail as the cottontail's teeth will damage the seeds. 4) The seeds go through the intestines of the jack rabbit and are deposited on the ground in its excrement; and 5) The scat protects the seeds until a special termite eats them and causes the seeds to germinate and then to propagate. It is an extremely complicated life cycle and if any one of the steps is interrupted, the plant does not reproduce. While the above is a typical cycle for the species, seeds collected directly from fruits and not subjected to passing through the intestines of a jackrabbit or other animal can have a high germination rate and be successfully grown into mature plants.

In the period 1482‚Äì1492, the cities of the County of Flanders revolted twice against Archduke Maximilian of Austria, who ruled the county as regent for his son, Philip the Handsome. The revolts were rooted in the cities' desire to maintain the autonomy that they had wrested from Philip's mother and predecessor, Mary of Burgundy, which Maximilian threatened to curtail. Both revolts were ultimately unsuccessful.  Background  Division of the Burgundian possessions between France and the Habsburgs, 1477/1482/1493 At the end of the 15th century, Flanders was under Burgundian rule. When the Burgundian Duke Charles the Bold died in battle in 1477, his territories passed to his daughter, Mary. The Netherlandish towns and their States General compelled Mary to sign a treaty, the Great Privilege, that reversed some of the centralization of power undertaken by her father and her grandfather, Duke Philip the Good, and turned the Burgundian state in the Netherlands into a confederation of provinces. The Members (representatives) of Flanders obtained an additional Flemish Privilege, which required their consent in any constitutional change. Meanwhile, the area west of the Scheldt (Royal Flanders), as well as other provinces of the Burgundian state, were claimed as reverted fiefs by France. Fearing French invasion, the provinces of the Low Countries levied an army of 100,000 men to replace the former ducal army; more than one-third of its troops were supplied by Flanders. Mary, seeking peace with her powerful neighbor, was involved in negotiations with Louis XI concerning a possible marriage to the Dauphin Charles (then only eight years old), but her embassy met harsh demands for territorial concessions to the French crown. On the evening of 16 August 1477, Mary instead married Maximilian of Habsburg, son of the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III, at Ghent. He would rule the Burgundian lands jointly with Mary, vowing to uphold the privileges granted to its towns and cities. The following years, a war with France was fought by Flemish armies under Maximilian, culminating in the 1479 Battle of Guinegate, a Habsburg victory. The German and other foreign troops were not well received in Flanders: the citizens of Ghent rioted against their presence in 1478. When Mary died in a horse-riding accident in 1482, her four- year-old son Philip the Fair in turn inherited her realms in the Netherlands, worsening the succession crisis in the Burgundian lands. By the terms of the Treaty of Arras (1482), Maximilian was forced to cede Artois and Picardy to France, but retained control over Flanders as Philip's guardian. France nevertheless openly supported Flemish \\"particularism\\" against the Burgundians/Habsburgs.  First revolt (1483 - 1485)  Several Flemish cities challenged Maximilian's guardianship of Philip, fearing centralization of power in the combined Habsburg lands. Ghent was the Archduke's main opponent, and went so far as to issue its own coinage in Philip's name, an act that was \\"perilously near to a unilateral declaration of independence\\" because the unification of coinage was vital to the Burgundian Netherlands' prosperity. On 5 June 1483, the Flemish cities formed their own regency council for the young prince. Since Philip was in Bruges, in the hands of the rebels, Maximilian attempted to negotiate, offering to dismiss members of his court that displeased the Flemish. Simultaneous troubles in the Prince-Bishoprics of Li√®ge and Utrecht, meant that the archduke could not intervene until 1484. His relationship with Flanders deteriorated as the Knights of the Golden Fleece at Dendermonde deposed him as head of their Order, Bruges refused to admit the archduke into their city with a company of more than a dozen people, and the commander of the Flemish armies proclaimed himself lieutenant-general in the name of Philip the Fair. Flanders attempted to forge an alliance with the neighboring Duchy of Brabant, but did not succeed. In November 1484, Maximilian convened the States General; Flanders did not attend, but the other provinces of the Burgundian Netherlands pledged their support to the archduke, enraged as they were by the Flemish cities' unwillingness to cooperate (in particular, Bruges and Ghent had attempted to block Antwerp's trade routes). Instead, the cities and nobility of Brabant ultimately joined the Habsburg side. In France, Louis XI had died, and the new King Charles VIII was underage. His regency council withdrew its armies in spite of French promises to support the Flemish, but the French did appease the Flemish towns by renouncing the Parliament of Paris' claim of jurisdiction over them. 1485 saw open warfare between the Habsburg prince and the Flemings. In January, Maximilian's army took Oudenaarde and subsequently defeated the forces of Ghent under their own walls. But when a mutiny broke out in his army, he was forced to retreat; French troops led by Cr√®vec≈ìur then entered the city. The French, however, misbehaved so badly when in Flanders that they too were soon forced to leave for Tournai. The following summer, first Bruges and then Ghent saw a coup d'√©tat in favor of Maximilian. On 21 June Bruges surrendered, acknowledging Maximilian I as its mambourg followed by a similar acknowledgment by Ghent a week later. Philip the Fair was returned to his father on July 6. The archduke made a treaty with Ghent and Bruges, confirming the cities' privileges, but soon revoked all these terms: on July 22, he enacted revenge on Ghent, had 33 rebel leaders executed, many more banished, and the city's privileges were to be reviewed and revised by a committee.  Second revolt (1487 - 1492) With the rebels in the Netherlands subdued, Maximilian again turned his attention to France and raised taxes in the rich Southern Netherlands to finance his military campaigns. Compared to the period of Maximilian and Mary's joint reign, the taxes levied on Flanders had doubled by 1487, while the seigniorage on silver coins had risen to 120 groats per mark (effectively 12%), up from at most three groats under Philip the Good. Inflation grew rampant, with food prices rising, in some cases doubling; epidemics decimated the population. Economic hardship and heavy taxation, combined with the failure of the military campaign against France, sparked a second revolt in Ghent in November 1487, led, like the previous time, by the weaver's guild. From Bruges, Maximilian, now King of the Romans, negotiated with Ghent the following month. But when he attempted to close off the city with his own troops in January the following year, the guilds of Bruges joined the revolt, demanding publicity of the grievances of the rebels (a.o., plundering of the country by Habsburg troops) as well as the decision making process. They forbade Maximilian from leaving the city, then in February imprisoned him after installing new municipal officials, loyal to Philip and executed one of Maximilian's ministers. Both the papacy and the Holy Roman Empire intervened in the conflict. The pope excommunicated the rebels and Maximilian's father Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor, raised an army of 20,000 men in Germany that reached Flanders through Brabant in April 1488. In the following month, Maximilian made a deal with his captors. He was to relinquish the title \\"count of Flanders\\", leaving control of the province in the hands of a government similar to the one that existed prior to 1482, in exchange for a yearly fee. But as soon as he had left the city, he broke the oath, citing his feudal oath to his overlord, his father the Emperor, as taking precedence over the oath he had just sworn. Maximilian's military commander Philip of Cleves had volunteered to take his lord's place as the rebels' hostage, but subsequently joined the rebellion for what he considered treason by Maximilian. The former Admiral of the Netherlands became the rebels' military commander and \\"terrorised the sea\\" using Sluis as a naval base. Brabantian cities including Brussels and Leuven joined the rebellion, as did the Hook party in Holland. Antwerp again chose the side of the Habsburgs, raising a mercenary army of ca. 1400 soldiers, including 400 cavalrymen. The second Flemish revolt was ultimately crushed in 1492 by Frederick III's army, now aided by the English. German blockades of Bruges' trade routes and ports, supported from the sea by a fleet led by the English Admiral Edward Poynings, paralyzed the city's trade. The Flemish cities were forced to accept Maximilian as regent.  Results  The Rabot in Ghent: a monument for the city's victory over Frederick III's besieging army in 1488. In the Treaty of Senlis (1493), the new French king, Charles VIII, ceded Artois and Saint-Pol and renounced his claims to Flanders. These territories became part of the Holy Roman Empire, of which Maximilian became emperor in August of the same year. The next year, 1494, he formally bestowed the government of the Low Countries upon Philip, who proved popular with the nobles of the low countries. The larger part of Flanders remained in Habsburg hands until 1794. One of the consequences of the revolts was the rise of Antwerp as an economic power, at the expense of Bruges. Antwerp (like Amsterdam) had lent support to Frederick III against the rebels because of the many privileges it had received from Maximilian I, and would see a \\"golden age\\" until the Dutch Revolt of the late 16th century.

In addition to these two regular payments, the organist at the church received \\"Speisegeld\\" (money for food) twice a year, a coal allowance, and payments in kind (rye, meat and wood), and Ulich also received an additional payment in lieu of house rent. The organist was not a court employee in Zerbst, but they did receive payments in kind; the 1708/09 accounts show that both Meyer and Ulich received 20 Thaler - Ulich is even noted as \\"the new organist\\"; Landesarchiv Sachsen- Anhalt, Aussenstelle Dessau, Z92 Kammerrechnungen 1708/09, p. 62 show that he was paid at least one quarterly salary installment and some of the bonuses that all permanent staff there enjoyed annually in 1708).

His primary research focus is the underlying biology behind melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Over the course of his career, he has been responsible for the use of three-dimensional artificial skin cultures to study tumor and normal cells, a clearer understanding of stem cells and how they relate to cancer, and signaling pathways related to cancer. The Wistar Melanoma (WM) cell lines that Herlyn has used and helped discover in his laboratory are responsible for a better understanding of the major steps of tumor progression in human cases of melanoma. In 2003, Herlyn helped launch the first International Melanoma Research Congress in Philadelphia, the first scientific meeting specifically aimed at melanoma scientists. This was done in collaboration with the Foundation for Melanoma Research. This collaboration was prompted with his first direct melanoma patient interaction after more than two decades of research on the disease. He also established the Society for Melanoma Research in 2004 and served as its president for three years. One of the more recent discoveries made by Herlyn's lab found that the diabetes drug phenformin could be used to treat certain slow-growing, drug-resistant tumor cells in melanoma. In December 2013, it was announced that Herlyn and his colleagues had received a five-year, $12.5 million program project grant (PO1) to continue research on melanoma from multiple angles. In May 2013, L'Or√©al Paris announced that Herlyn would lead the Melanoma Research Alliance Team Science Award, which provides more than $750,000 over three years to research the prevention, treatment, and potential cures for melanoma.

Geography  Silkwood is situated on the Bruce Highway roughly halfway between Tully and Innisfail. The locality is flat land about 10 metres above sea level and is predominantly freehold land used for farming, particularly the cultivation of sugarcane. The north-western border of the locality is Liverpool Creek, which flows eastward to the Coral Sea. The town is roughly central in the locality with the Bruce Highway passing from south to north just east of the town, while the North Coast railway line also passes from south to north through the town, which is serviced by the Silkwood railway station.  History  The town takes its name from the name of the house of A. J. Daveson, and refers to a local timber. Silkwood State School opened on 28 August 1916. Silkwood was the site of significant Italian immigration in the 1940s. On Sunday 15 December 1940, Roman Catholic Bishop of Cairns, John Heavey, laid the foundation stone for a church to be dedicated to St John the Evangelist. He returned on Sunday 3 August 1941 to perform the blessing and opening of the Gothic-style church. St John's Catholic School was founded by the parish priest Father Alfred Natali and the Missionary Franciscan Sisters.

Events  On the first Sunday of May, Silkwood celebrates the annual Feast of the Three Saints: St Alfio, St Filadelfo and St Cerino. In 1939, Silkwood resident Alfia Tornabene (n√©e Patti) had just given birth to a daughter in Innisfail Hospital, becoming seriously ill. Her husband Rosario dreamt of the three saints who reassured him his wife would recover, leading Rosario to vow that he would bring statues of the saints from Sicily to Silkwood if his wife recovered. His wife recovered and in 1947-1948 he organised for an old artisan in Giarre, Sicily, to carve the statues from cherry trees near his family's farm in Sicily as recreations of the statues in the main church of Sant'Alfio. The first celebration of the feast in Silkwood was in 1950. The festival typically consists of a Mass, a procession of the statues through the streets accompanied by bands, feasting, music, dancing and fireworks.

The species is named in honor of American botanist Walter Almond KelleyWalter Kelley Obituary, CO ‚Äî The Daily Sentinel and is a member of the Macrostachys clade of the pepper genus. Piper kelleyi features long, white, pendulous inflorescences and large leaves. It is mostly restricted to montane elevations and produces secondary compounds that deter most herbivores. The most important secondary compounds discovered from P. kelleyi are a prenylated benzoic acid and 2 chromanes that are unique to this species. Piper kelleyi was scientifically described on February 7, 2014 in the journal PhytoKeys. The pinkish undersides of the leaves gave this species the nickname \\"pink belly\\" in the research team. Several insect species are entirely dependent on Piper kelleyi for survival, including many specialized caterpillars in the genus Eois (Geometridae).
