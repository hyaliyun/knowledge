His main topics are the French medical system, the relationships between caregivers and patients and Women's Health. One of the first TV series critics in France, he has written numerous articles and books on the subject (ER; Grey's Anatomy; House, MD; Law & Order). Biography His family emigrated from Algeria first to Israel in 1961 then to France in 1962. He was a dedicated young reader and writer. After graduating from Medical School in Tours, he practised in a small country town in Sarthe (western rural France) from 1983 to 1993. From 1983 to 1989, he worked as an editor then as assistant editor-in-chief for the independent medical journal La Revue Prescrire under his real name, Marc Zaffran. In the mid-80's, his first short stories were published under the pseudonym \\"Martin Winckler\\". This name is a tribute to the French writer Georges Perec: Gaspard Winckler is one of the main characters in La Vie mode d'emploi (Life : A User's Manual), a very important book in Marc Zaffran's literary education. His first novel La Vacation (pub. 1989) introduces the central character of his major novels, Bruno Sachs M.D., who became famous in France with his second published novel La Maladie de Sachs ; (in English The Case of Dr Sachs Translated by Linda Asher, Seven Stories Press, NY, 2000). It became a motion picture, written, produced and directed by Rosalinde and Michel Deville (1999). Albert Dupontel plays Bruno Sachs. He opened a rural medical practice in 1983 which he left in 1993 to spend most of his time as a writer and translator. However, he remained a part-time doctor at the Le Mans public hospital, in the Abortion and Contraception clinic until 2008. His practice as a women's health physician lasted for 25 years. Many of his books were based on his experience as a medical practitioner. Created in 2004, his web site \\"Winckler's Webzine\\" has published numerous texts about healthcare, contraception, TV serials. The \\"Contraception / Gynecology\\" section is the most frequently viewed. In 2009 he immigrated to Montreal, Quebec where he first worked as a guest researcher at the Centre de Recherches en √©thique de l'Universit√© de Montr√©al (CREUM), on a research project about the training of medical personnel. He became a Canadian citizen in 2019. Several of his books address the French medical culture and describe it as \\"archaic, violent and sexist and based on abuse of power\\". Most of his novels and essays address patient rights, the right to accept or reject treatments, power struggles between physicians and patients, and women's health. *The Case of Dr Sachs (P.O.L, 1998) is a very detailed description of a country physician's activities, as described by patients, relatives, colleagues and friends. The book sold 300,000 copies in its first edition alone. *Les Trois M√©decins (P.O.L, 2004) was inspired by Alexandre Dumas' \\"The Three Musketeers\\". It is set in a French Medical school in the 70s and tells how Bruno Sachs and three of his friends dedicated themselves to General Practice. *Le Ch≈ìur des femmes (P.O.L, 2009) is a novel set in a Women's Health Clinic in central France. Another best seller, it sold 65,000 copies in its first edition and has been a paperback best seller since 2011 (240,000 copies and counting). * En souvenir d'Andr√© (P.O.L, 2012) is a short novel whose protagonist provides Medical Assistance in Dying. *Les Brutes en Blanc (\\"Brutes in white coats\\"), an essay published in 2016, made the French medical establishment very angry by its description of ongoing and institutionalized medical brutality in France. The \\"Ordre des m√©decins\\" (France's medical regulatory board) issued a statement to condemn the book as \\"a caricature of reality\\". Many other books addressing the very same topic have since been published, confirming Winckler's description and analysis through extended research. * L'Ecole des soignantes (P.O.L, 2019) a Science-Fiction Novel, is the sequel to Le Choeur des femmes. Set in 2032, it describes a medical training school mostly run by female healthcare workers who have set aside all kind of hierarchy between professionals and provide care respectful of patients' preferences, choices and decisions.

He first appears during the episode airing on 28 January 2010 as a lodger for Janice Battersby (Vicky Entwistle). He lodged with Janice at 14a Victoria Street from February to October 2010. He dated Carla Connor (Alison King), who gave him a managerial job at her lingerie factory Underworld but he quit and left the area when the arrangement didn't work out. He returned in March 2011, and later left with Janice to go traveling. Storylines=2010‚Äì2011 In January 2010, whilst working, Trevor refuses to empty Janice Battersby's (Vicky Entwistle) wheelie bin as the lid is not down. Janice is annoyed but is smitten with Trevor when he responds to her advertisement for a lodger, needing somewhere to live after splitting up with his ex-girlfriend. Trevor enjoys living with Janice but does not realize that she is attracted to him. When he takes in two stray cats, Janice puts up with them despite being allergic. In February, Trevor is looking for Janice and finds her boss, Carla Connor (Alison King), cleaning so he thinks she is the cleaner. When he later sees her at The Rovers, they exchange numbers and agree to a date until Trevor sees Underworld's real cleaner, Teresa Bryant (Karen Henthorn), and Carla getting out of her expensive car. Rather than being angry at Carla's deception, Trevor is bemused, and he and Carla go on to have an enjoyable first date. From then on, their romance blossoms. In May 2010, Trevor tries to organize a World Cup trip for Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson), Ashley Peacock (Steven Arnold), Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne) and Tyrone Dobbs (Alan Halsall), on the condition that they keep it from their wives and girlfriends. On 14 May, Janice finds a suitcase full of cash under Trevor's bed and asks him what it is, worried he earned it illegally, so Trevor reveals that it is his savings for the World Cup and Janice agrees to keep quiet, providing she can come too. Trevor also tries to negotiate a business deal for Carla in the Rovers Return when a businessman thinks he is Carla's business partner. Trevor hears that Carla's ex-husband Tony Gordon (Gray O'Brien) has escaped from prison and seeks to use this as a reason to stay with Carla. After the siege at the factory, Trevor helps Carla recover and asks her to go to the World Cup with him. She accepts and they spend two weeks in South Africa. They return in July 2010 and Carla offers Trevor a trainee manager's position at Underworld. He accepts but this annoys her business partner and shareholder Nick Tilsley (Ben Price) who considers Trevor incompetent. Trevor is unhappy and after making a number of costly mistakes, his relationship with Carla is strained. The final straw comes when Nick insults him and Trevor punches him in front of everyone at the factory and has a blazing row with Carla, who admits that their relationship is no longer working. He tells Carla that she has never got over the death of her former lover and brother-in-law Liam Connor (Rob James-Collier) and that he cannot live in the shadow of a dead man. Later that night in the Rovers' smoking shelter, Trevor recounts the events of his day to Lloyd Mullaney (Craig Charles) who convinces him to get in touch with his ex-girlfriend, Michaela, and look to the future. With Lloyd's advice in mind, Trevor comes to realize that there is nothing left for him in Weatherfield. He decides to go to Swansea and attempt a reconciliation with Michaela. As he moves his belongings out of Carla's apartment, he warns her to be vigilant about her drinking. Trevor then comforts her about their broken relationship and wishes her well and leaves. In March 2011, Janice informs Eileen Grimshaw (Sue Cleaver) and Sean Tully (Antony Cotton) that she thought she saw Trevor and tells Carla but Carla insists that she was seeing things. A few days later, Janice bumps into Trevor in Roy's Rolls, he tells her he has been in the area for the past month. He later spots Janice in the rain and he asks her to go for a drink with him. She agrees and they go to The Rovers. The next day, he asks Janice to leave with him and she agrees after saying goodbye to stepdaughter Leanne (Jane Danson). Izzy Armstrong (Cherylee Houston) sees them about to leave and tells everyone in the pub, so Trevor deliberately drives through a puddle, soaking them, with Janice shouting \\"Losers\\" as they drive off into the distance together. Creation and development=Background The character of Trevor is introduced in early 2010 as a bin-man and lodger for Janice Battersby. Trevor forms a mis-matched relationship with Carla Connor and also plans a trip to the World Cup. Departure and return On 6 May 2010 it was reported that the character of Trevor would be axed and the actor's contract terminated. This came as part of a wider drive by new producer Phil Collinson to revive the show and improve the quality of the performers involved. The character left on 4 October 2010. Trevor returned briefly in March 2011 to enable the departure of Janice Battersby. Reception Inside Soap have branded Trevor as one of the departed characters in 2010 that will not be remembered in the future.

It is a significant step towards India's pursuit for self-reliance in indigenous warship building, bringing closer home Indian Navy's quest to be a true Blue-Water Navy with ships and submarines designed and built within the country. She was designed and manufactured by GRSE, launched on 19 April 2010, as part of Project 28, approved in 2003. As in INS Shivalik, high-grade steel produced in India was utilized for its construction. She was delivered to Navy on 12 July 2014. She is the first indigenous anti-submarine corvette as well as the first indigenous stealth corvette built by India. She has enhanced stealth features such as an X Form Hull and inclined sides for low Radar cross-section, Infra- red suppression, and Acoustic quieting systems. Union minister of defense, Arun Jaitley commissioned the ship on 23 August 2014. It was named after Kamorta island in Andaman and Nicobar, India . Design and Description Kamorta was originally expected to be built using high-tensile imported steel. But lapses in imports lead it to be built by indigenously developed special grade high-tensile steel (DMR249A) produced by state-owned Steel Authority of India from its Bhilai Steel Plant. The ships employs very low under water voice signature and radar cross-section due to its ‚ÄòX‚Äô form of hull and superstructure. She is the first Indian Navy ship to be built with carbon fiber reinforced plastic which reduces weight and life cycle maintenance costs. The hull of the ship encompassed the bulk of sensors and weapon systems that were also indigenously manufactured by various Indian industries. It is the first indigenous anti-submarine corvette as well as the first indigenous stealth corvette built by India. About 90% of the ship is indigenous and the ship is capable of fighting in NBC conditions. It is equipped with a rail-less helo traversing system which is used for handling a helicopter. It also features a foldable hangar door. General characteristics and propulsion Kamorta will have a length of overall and a beam of . The ships displace about at full load. It is powered by four diesel engines at 1,050 rpm It uses four Pielstick 12 PA6 STC diesel engines in CODAD configuration and is propelled two two-shaft, controllable-pitch propellers which allow the ship to reach a top speed of . It will have a complement of about 180 sailors and 15 officers excluding flight crew for the integral ASW helicopter and an endurance of .  Armament  Kamorta is equipped with a wide range of weapon systems.

Richard Kestenbaum spent over 30 years as an investment banker at several firms, most recently at Drexel Burnham Lambert where he was a partner, and a boutique firm called Financo, Inc. Errol Glasser was a Managing Director responsible for West Coast investment banking activity at Kidder Peabody and a Principal in The Trump Group, a privately held New York-based investment company. The firm has made a name for itself in advising retail, apparel and consumer product companies such as Cross Pen, Red Envelope, Liz Lange Maternity, and Iconix Brand Group but also counts a diverse group of non retail companies on its roster of clients. Kestenbaum is a regular speaker at the Fashion Institute of Technology, the New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants, in China at the invitation of the Chinese Government to members of the Chinese apparel manufacturing sector and other industry forums. He is often quoted in Women‚Äôs Wear Daily and other industry publications. Kestenbaum recently penned an article titled \\"7 Things to Consider Before Raising $$$\\", which was published in \\"The Accessories Magazine\\".RICHARD KESTENBAUM, \\"The Accessories Magazine\\" Nov. 2, 2011, \\"Source 1\\", Nov. 4, 2011 History Triangle Capital LLC was founded in 2003 when Glasser joined forces with Kestenbaum whom he had met when he was on the opposing side of a transaction years before. Kestenbaum began his career at Drexel Burnham Lambert where he was a partner in the firm's New York office. Following the collapse of Drexel, Kestenbaum left to join Financo, Inc. where he served as managing director conducting the majority of that firm‚Äôs apparel transaction business during his 10-year tenure there. Kestenbaum has also written three books on finance and computer science and taught International Business at New York University‚Äôs Stern School of Business. Glasser is a native of South Africa, but came to the U.S. in 1978 after qualifying as a Chartered Accountant. He began his finance career at Revlon in corporate development. After joining Kidder Peabody in 1986, Glasser quickly rose in the ranks, joining the Operating Committee in 1991 and became the head of West Coast banking. After leaving Kidder, Glasser went out on his own, purchasing and running several different companies before getting back into investment banking. He has served on numerous boards including Tyco Toys, Montgomery Ward, Pay ‚Äòn Save, Telescene and Regency Affiliates. In April 2018, Triange Capital Corporation entered into a purchase agreement with an affiliate of Benefit Street Partners LLC for its December 31, 2017 investment portfolio to funds advised by BSP. The transaction was completed on July 31, 2018, and the company sold substantially all of its investment portfolio for gross cash proceeds of $739.3 million. Business Services Triangle Capital‚Äôs primary role is providing advice to middle market companies relating to mergers and acquisitions. Much of its work is sell-side engagements where the firm is hired to sell a company for its owners. Triangle Capital is also actively involved in raising capital for companies that are looking to grow, or want to recapitalize. Triangle Capital has also been working to establish a foothold in China, believing that an increasing level of investment and M&A; activity will be emanating from Chinese apparel manufacturers seeking to buy U.S. brands. Chinese manufacturers have a clear opportunity to move up the value chain by getting closer to the end consumer. It will also enable them to bring an established U.S. brand to the Chinese marketplace.JOSH KOSMAN and JAMES COVERT, \\"New York Post\\", August 4, 2011, \\"Source 2\\", August 8, 2011 Triangle Capital is in a unique position to apply its in depth knowledge of the U.S. apparel, merchandising and retail market to assist these Chinese manufacturers in their endeavors.

When the gangway is not in use they lock outwards to block off the entire cab/gangway compartment. View along full length of a Toronto Rocket, folding seats at the right A gangway connection (or, more loosely, a corridor connection) is a flexible connector fitted to the end of a railway coach, enabling passengers to move from one coach to another without danger of falling from the train. Origins: Coaches in British and American railways The London and North Western Railway (LNWR) was the first British railway to provide passengers with the means to move from one coach to another whilst the train was in motion. In 1869 the LNWR built a pair of saloons for the use of Queen Victoria; these had six-wheel underframes (the bogie coach did not appear in Britain until 1874), and the gangway was fitted to only one end of each coach. The Queen preferred to wait until the train had stopped before using the gangway. This British locomotive has a centre buffing plate similar to that fitted to the lower portion of a Pullman-type gangway connection. In 1887, George M. Pullman introduced his patented vestibule cars. Older railroad cars had open platforms at their ends, which were used both for joining and leaving the train, but could also be used to step from one car to the next. This practice was dangerous, and so Pullman decided to enclose the platform to produce the vestibule. For passing between cars, there was a passageway in the form of a steel-framed rectangular diaphragm mounted on a buffing plate above the centre coupler. The vestibule prevented passengers from falling out, and protected passengers from the weather when passing between cars. In the event of an accident, the design also helped prevent cars from overriding each other, reducing the risk of telescoping. Pullman's vestibule cars were first used in 1887. Among the first to use them was the Pennsylvania Railroad on the Pennsylvania Limited service to Chicago. The Great Northern Railway introduced the Gould-design gangway connection to Great Britain in 1889, when E.F. Howlden was Carriage and Wagon Superintendent. On 7 March 1892, the Great Western Railway (GWR) introduced a set of gangwayed coaches on their to Birkenhead service. Built to the design of William Dean, it was the first British side-corridor train to have gangway connections between all the coaches, although they were provided not to enable passengers to move around the train, but rather to allow the guard to reach any compartment quickly. Electric bells were provided so that he could be summoned. When the guard was not so required, he kept the communicating doors locked. Passengers could still use the side-corridor within the coach to reach the toilet. The gangway connections of the early GWR corridor coaches were offset to one side. Some coaches intended for use at the ends of trains had the gangway connection fitted at one end only. The GWR introduced restaurant cars in 1896; gangway connections were fitted, but passengers wishing to use the restaurant car were expected to board it at the start of their journey, and remain there: the connections were still not for public use. A GWR coach fitted with a British Standard gangway connection of the \\"suspended\\" type On 17 May 1923, the GWR introduced some new coaches on their South Wales services; some of these coaches had British Standard gangway connections and screw couplers as used on many other GWR coaches; some had Pullman-type gangway connections and Laycock \\"buckeye\\" couplers; and there were some with one type at one end, and the other end having the other type. In 1925 the GWR started to use the \\"suspended\\" form of gangway connection instead of the \\"scissors\\" pattern. From 1938, GWR coaches which were expected to need coupling to LNER or SR coaches were fitted with gangway adaptors, to allow the dissimilar types to be connected. From the beginning, the London, Midland and Scottish Railway used the British Standard type of gangway connector, with its \\"scissors\\" pattern as used by the GWR. Some coaches needed for LNER or SR lines were given gangway adaptors, so that they could safely couple to coaches fitted with the Pullman-type gangway. On the formation of British Railways on 1 January 1948, operators decided to produce a new range of standard coaches, instead of perpetuating existing designs‚Äîbut the new types had to be compatible with the old. Two of the pre-BR companies (the GWR and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway) favoured the British Standard gangway, whereas the other two (the London and North Eastern Railway and the Southern Railway) used the Pullman type. In the design of their new Mark 1 coaches, British Railways decided to standardise on the Pullman type in view of its resistance to telescoping. These gangways consisted of a flat steel plate, having a large aperture for the passageway. At the bottom it was riveted to the buffing plate, whilst the top was supported on the coach end by two telescopic spring units. On the coach end was a wooden doorframe; this was connected to the faceplate by a flexible diaphragm made from plasticised asbestos. When two coaches were coupled, a curtain was used to cover the inside surfaces of the diaphragms and faceplates. The doorframe was fitted with a lockable door, of either sliding or hinged type, depending on the interior layout of that end of the coach. Travelling Post Office post office stowage tender with offset gangway connection Coaches built for the Travelling Post Office (TPO) services normally had their gangway connections offset to one side. There were two main reasons: there was a perceived security risk should these coaches be coupled to ordinary passenger-carrying coaches, the differing gangway positions minimising the risk of intrusion; and more space was available for sorting tables, the postal workers being able to walk in a straight line between vans without disturbing the sorters. A disadvantage was that when a van was added to a TPO train, it might need to be turned around before it could be used. After the formation of British Railways, most new Mark 1 TPO vans were provided with centre gangways, though a batch intended to work with older vans were given offset gangways. These were altered to the standard arrangement in 1973. Until then, they had been the only BR Mark 1 gangwayed coaches not to have the Pullman gangway. Locomotives (corridor tenders) LNER Class A1 4-6-2 with corridor tender. Circular window of passageway at upper right of tender rear. The London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) decided that from the start of their summer timetable on 1 May 1928, the Flying Scotsman service would run non-stop over the between and . The locomotives to be used were of that railway's class A1, and the schedule was for the journey to be completed in hours. This was too long to allow a single crew to handle the train without a rest; means were therefore sought by which the crew could be changed at approximately the half-way point. A preserved corridor tender. The passageway runs along the side closest to the camera; the top of the passageway may be seen at the rear The LNER's locomotive design team, headed by Nigel Gresley, produced a new design of tender that was slightly longer than the old, but built as high and wide as possible without compromising the loading gauge. A passageway was incorporated along the right- hand side, and at the rear end a Pullman type gangway connection was fitted, together with a buckeye coupler, both of which were compatible with LNER coaches; the gangway was of concertina pattern, and was pressed against the corresponding gangway on the leading coach by means of sprung pistons. Although a normal gangway connection was used, the passageway through the tender was only high and wide, and the floor of the passage was above the bottom of the water tank, giving a high step at both ends. The passageway was illuminated by a single circular window in the tender rear panel, placed high up and to the right of the corridor connection. Ten of these tenders were placed in service between April and September 1928, of which three were attached to new locomotives of Class A3; two were attached to existing Class A3 locomotives, and five attached to Class A1 locomotives. The design was patented by Gresley in August 1928. In service, the relief crew travelled in the front coach of the train, and as the train approached the half-way point, they left their seats and made their way forward through the corridor tender to the locomotive cab. On their arrival, the previous crew then handed over the controls and went back to the seats in the train vacated by the relief crew. Another corridor tender was built in 1929 for use with the new Class W1 4-6-4 no. 10000; four more were built in 1935 with the first four locomotives of the new Class A4, and a final seven were built with the 1937 batch of Class A4 locomotives, making a total of 22. The original ten were reconditioned in 1936‚Äì1937 and attached to other Class A4 locomotives. In May 1948, the 1929-built corridor tender was transferred to a locomotive of Class A4, after which all 22 remained with this class until withdrawal. In the USA, the Milwaukee Road class A 4-4-2s of 1935 built for the hour Hiawatha express also used a corridor tender.

Articulated buses similarly have extensions connected with a gangway. Open gangways have also become increasingly used for heavy rail rapid transit rolling stock. It provides a way to seamlessly move between cars at any time, without passing through doors and a dangerous open area that is often against the rules. It also raises the capacity of metro cars by about 10%, a significant improvement for systems such as the New York City Subway where infrastructure and timetables are near or at capacity. RATP was the first European authority to order open gangway cars for Paris Metro, with Bombardier MF 88 and GEC Alsthom MP 89 (as NS 93 for Santiago Metro); it was followed by Metrovalencia FGV 3900, Madrid Metro AnsaldoBreda 7000 and CAF 8000, and Rome Metro MA-300 (CAF S/300). In North America, the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) was the first transit authority to use open gangway rolling stock, with its Toronto Rocket railcars (a variant of the Bombardier Movia line of open-gangway cars) delivered to the Toronto subway system from 2010. The Soci√©t√© de Transport de Montr√©al (STM) upgraded its fleet of subway cars with Azur (MPM-10) trains that included open gangways.STM societyinmotion.org http://www.mouvementcollectif.org/SWF/?en/#/metro-cars Montreal Metro took delivery of the Bombardier/Alstom MPM-10 Azur trains in 2016. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is considering the design for the New York City Subway's planned R211 order. Initially the order will consist of 545 cars, of which 20 will be in experimental open gangway formations. The order includes an option to purchase up to 640 additional open gangway cars, the decision of which will be based on the success of the prototype set. The open gangway design has been incorporated into Alstom Metropolis, Bombardier Movia and Innovia Metro, Siemens Inspiro, and 81-760 Oka/81-765 Moskva trains which operate on a variety of subway systems around the world, such as Riyadh Metro (Inspiro, Innnovia, Metropolis); Singapore MRT (Metropolis, Movia); Barcelona Metro, Amsterdam Metro, Budapest Metro, Buenos Aires Underground, Sydney Metro (Metropolis); Vancouver SkyTrain (Innovia); London Underground (Inspiro New Tube for London, S Stock); Baku Metro (Oka, Moskva); and Tashkent Metro (Moskva). Some trains, like U-Bahn BVG Class HK, S-Bahn DBAG Class 481, 81-740 Rusich etc. use open gangways only between car pairs or 3-car sets; recent versions of these trains, Class IK, Class 483 and 81-760 Oka/81-765 Moskva, employ full walkthrough gangway along entire train.

Toyoharu was born in Japan in Tajima Province (in red) in 1735. Born in Toyooka in Tajima Province, Toyoharu first studied art in Kyoto, then in Edo (modern Tokyo), where from 1768 he began to produce designs for ukiyo-e woodblock prints. He soon became known for his ' \\"floating pictures\\" of landscapes and famous sites, as well as copies of Western and Chinese perspective prints. Though his were not the first perspective prints in ukiyo-e, they were the first to appear as full-colour nishiki-e, and they demonstrate a much greater mastery of perspective techniques than the works of his predecessors. Toyoharu was the first to make the landscape a subject of ukiyo-e art, rather than just a background to figures and events. By the 1780s he had turned primarily to painting. The Utagawa school of art grew to dominate ukiyo-e in the 19th century with artists such as Utamaro, Hiroshige, and Kuniyoshi.A Perspective View of French Churches in Holland, actually based on a print of the Roman Forum, Life and career Utagawa Toyoharu was born in Toyooka in Tajima Province. He studied in Kyoto under of the Kan≈ç school of painting. It may have been around 1763 that he moved to Edo (modern Tokyo), where he studied under Toriyama Sekien. The Toyo () in the art name Toyoharu () is said to have come from Sekien's personal name Toyofusa (). Some sources hold he also studied under Ishikawa Toyonobu and Nishimura Shigenaga. Other art names Toyoharu went under include Ichiry≈´sai (), Senry≈´sai (), and Sh≈çjir≈ç (). Tradition holds that the name Utagawa derives from Udagawa-ch≈ç, where Toyoharu lived in the Shiba district in Edo. His common name was Tajimaya Sh≈çjir≈ç ( ), and he also used the personal names Masaki () and Shin'emon (). Toyoharu's work began to appear about 1768. His earliest work includes woodblock prints in a refined, delicate style of beauties and actors. Soon he began to produce ' \\"floating picture\\" perspective prints, a genre in which Toyoharu applied Western-style one-point perspective to create a realistic sense of depth. Most were of famous sites, including theatres, temples, and teahouses. Toyoharu's were not the first uki-e‚ÄîOkumura Masanobu had made such works since the early 1740s, and claimed the genre's origin for himself. Toyoharu's were the first uki-e in the full-colour ' genre that had developed in the 1760s.. Several of his prints were based on imported prints from the West or China. From the 1780s Toyoharu appears to have dedicated himself to painting, and also produced kabuki programs and billboards after 1785.. He headed the painters involved in the restoration of Nikk≈ç T≈çsh≈ç-g≈´ in 1796. He died in 1814 and was buried in Honky≈çji Temple in Ikebukuro under the Buddhist posthumous name Utagawa-in Toyoharu Nichiy≈ç Shinji ().

Harunobu pioneered the full-colour ' print and was particularly popular and influential in the 1760s, when Toyoharu first began his career. Toyoharu produced a number of willowy, graceful ' portraits of beauties in ' pillar prints. Only about fifteen examples of his ' are known, almost all from his earliest period. One of the better-known examples of Toyoharu's work in this style is a four-sheet set depicting the Chinese ideal of the Four Arts. Toyoharu produced a small number of ' actor prints that, in contrast to the works of the leading Katsukawa school, are executed in the learned style of an Ippitsusai Bunch≈ç. While Toyoharu trained in Kyoto he may have been exposed to the works of Maruyama ≈åkyo, whose popular megane-e were pictures in one-point perspective meant to be viewed in a special box in the manner of the French vue d'optique. Toyoharu may also have seen the Chinese vue d'optique prints made in the 1750s that inspired ≈åkyo's work. Early in his career, Toyoharu began producing the ' for which he is best remembered. Books on geometrical perspective translated from Dutch and Chinese sources appeared in the 1730s, and soon after, ukiyo-e prints displaying these techniques appeared first in the works of and then of Okumura Masanobu. These early examples were inconsistent in their application of perspective techniques, and the results can be unconvincing; Toyoharu's were much more dextrous, though not strict‚Äîhe manipulated it to allow the representation of figures and objects that otherwise would have been obscured. Toyoharu's works helped pioneer the landscape as an ukiyo-e subject, rather than merely a background for human figures or events, as in Masanobu's works. Toyoharu's earliest ' cannot be reliably dated, but are assumed to have appeared before 1772: early in that year the in Edo destroyed the Ni≈ç-mon gate in Ueno, the subject of Toyoharu's Famous Views of Edo: Ni≈ç-mon in Ueno. Famous Views of Edo: Ni≈ç-mon in Ueno, Several of Toyoharu's prints were imitations of imported prints of famed European locations, some of which were Western and others Chinese imitations of Western prints. The titles were often fictional: The Bell which Resounds for Ten Thousand Leagues in the Dutch Port of Frankai is an imitation of a print of the Grand Canal of Venice from 1742 by Antonio Visentini, itself based on a painting by Canaletto. Toyoharu titled another A Perspective View of French Churches in Holland, though he based it on a print of the Roman Forum. Toyoharu took licence with other details of foreign lands, such as having the Dutch swim in their canals. Japanese and Chinese mythology were also frequent subjects in Toyoharu's ' prints, the foreign perspective technique giving such prints an exotic feel. In his ' paintings the influence of Toyonobu can seem strong, but in his seals on these paintings Toyoharu proclaims himself a pupil of Sekien. His efforts contributed to the development of the Rinpa school. His paintings have joined the collections of foreign museums such as the British Museum, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Freer Gallery of Art. His paintings include ' folding screens‚Äîa genre in which ukiyo-e is said to have its origins, but was rare in ukiyo-e after the development of nishiki-e prints. A six-panel example of a spring scene in Yoshiwara resides in France in a private collection.

By the 19th century, Western-style perspective techniques had ceased to be a novelty and had been absorbed into Japanese artistic culture, deployed by such artists as Hokusai and Hiroshige, two artists best remembered for their landscapes, a genre Toyoharu pioneered. The Utagawa school that Toyoharu founded was to become one of the most influential, and produced works in a far greater variety of genres than any other school. His students included Toyokuni and Toyohiro; Toyohiro worked in the style of his master, while Toyokuni, who headed the school from 1814, became a prominent and prolific producer of yakusha-e prints of kabuki actors. Other well-known members of the school were Utamaro, Hiroshige, Kuniyoshi, and Kunisada. Though Japanese art schools, such as the Katsukawa in ukiyo-e and the Kan≈ç in painting, emphasized a uniformity of style, a general style in the Utagawa school is not easy to recognize aside from a concern with realism and facial expressiveness. The school dominated ukiyo-e production by the mid-19th century, and most of the artists‚Äîsuch as Kobayashi Kiyochika‚Äîwho documented the modernization of Japan during the Meiji period during ukiyo-e's declining years belonged to the Utagawa school. The Torii school lasted longer, but the Utagawa school had more adherents. It fostered closer master‚Äìstudent relations and more systematized training than in other schools. Excepting a few prominent examples, such as Hiroshige or Kuniyoshi, the later generations of artists tended to lack stylistic diversity, and their work has become emblematic of ukiyo-e's decline in the 19th century. Toyoharu also taught painting. His most prominent student was Sakai H≈çitsu. As of 2014, studies into Toyoharu's work have not been carried out in depth. Cataloguing and analyzing his work and his and his publishers' seals was still in its infancy.

He was also editor of the Minneapolis Tribune, and from late 1887 to 1888 Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Army of the Republic, succeeding Lucius Fairchild. Early Life & Ancestry Mr. Rea was a native of the state of Pennsylvania, born October 13, 1840 in Lower Oxford Township, Chester County. He was a second cousin, once removed, of John Andrew Rea. Both were brothers in Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity. In politics, Rea was a Republican, and was \\"considered a true friend of that party.\\"Herringshaw, T. W., Prominent Men and Women of the Day, A.B. Gehman & Co., 1888. Respect for the Republic ran deep in the Rea family. John was the son of Samuel Andrew Rea and Mary Patterson; great grandson of John Rea and Unknown Ewing, his spouse. Other forebears included Robert Patterson; Samuel Light and Mary Light; Jacob Light; and John Light. Grandfather Samuel Rea (1756‚Äì1816), brother to John Andrew Rea‚Äôs great grandmother Barbara, was a private in Captain Thomas Whiteside‚Äôs Company, Colonel Thomas Porter‚Äôs Battalion, Pennsylvania militia, fighting in the battles of Trenton, Princeton, Brandywine, Germantown and Monmouth; Samuel wintered at Valley Forge with General George Washington, assigned to the \\"fire detail\\" faking encampment while the Continental Army broke camp to avoid General Cornwallis and secure Princeton. Forebearor Robert Patterson was in the same battles, assigned to Captain Wilson's Company. John Light was secretary to the Convention at Lebanon, adopting the Lebanon Resolves on June 25, 1774, and was a member of the Committee of Safety, Lancaster County, during the Revolution. Jacob Light fought as a volunteer at the battle of Brandywine, occurring on part of his farm. After the war, he warred against the Miami nation in southern Ohio.Minnesota Society Sons of the American Revolution, Year Book (1889‚Äì1895) The Rea family prospered after the American Revolution. John Patterson Rea's father was a woolen manufacturer, and owned the factory in which John worked. The son, John, received his education, attending school until he was twenty years of age. In 1860, he emigrated to Piqua, Miami County, Ohio, where he taught school. Civil War Service On April 17, 1861, John P. Rea enlisted as a member of Company B of the Eleventh Ohio Infantry. After serving with this company for four months, he was commissioned second lieutenant of Company I, First Ohio Cavalry. Rea was commissioned Second Lieutenant on September 23, 1861, and for gallant and meritorious service he was promoted to First Lieutenant on March 12, 1862 and Major on November 23, 1863, following gallant service at Cleveland, Tennessee. Major Rea served continuously in the Army of the Cumberland until November 24, 1864, when he was obliged to resign due to poor health. He served in the regiment about three years and a half, and during that time was absent only ten days, seven as prisoner and three days on sick leave. Life After War Following his service, he matriculated at Ohio Wesleyan University, graduating from the classical course in June, 1864. During the vacation of 1866 he entered a law office at Lancaster, Pennsylvania, as a student, and was admitted to the Pennsylvania bar in August, 1868. Rea associated with M. J. Dickey, Esquire, who later replaced the late Thaddeus Stevens as a Member of the U. S. House of Representatives. Rea himself later made a bid for the seat but lost. In 1869, Rea was appointed a notary public in Lancaster . On April 7, 1869, Mr. Rea was appointed Assessor of Internal Revenue, 9th Pennsylvania District, by President Ulysses S. Grant, an office he held until it was abolished by law on May 12, 1873. In 1869 he was married. The Reas had no issue, but John took special interest in his cousin John Andrew Rea, joining efforts to found the New York Alpha Chapter of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity at Cornell University in 1869. Ne was a member, Irving Literary Society. Mr. Rea continued in the practice of the law in Lancaster until December, 1875, when he removed to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he became editor-in-chief of a prominent newspaper, the Minneapolis Tribune. He continued as editor until May, 1877, when he again resumed the practice of law.Records of Members of the Grand Army of the Republic (1886) In November 1877, he was elected Judge of Probate, Hennepin County, Minnesota, and served in that capacity until December 31, 1881. He then hung his own shingle as Rea, Kitchel & Shaw. When, in April, 1886, the judge resigned his seat on the bench of the local district court, Governor Hubbard appointed Judge Rea to fill the vacancy. Rea enlisted in the Grand Army of the Republic, George N. Morgan Post. He was a charter member of the GAR Post in Piqua, Ohio, in December 1866, also a charter member of Gen. George H.

The estimated population is 383, and the settlement lies at an elevation of .  Chepkitale =Introduction The Ogiek have lived across the whole of the vast swathe of moorland covering Mt. Elgon since time immemorial. In Mt. Elgon and Tans-Nzoia Districts they have been historically and traditionally acknowledged as the established, if minority, hunter gatherer community (Ogiek), who turned pastoralists (Ogiik). Today the population in their age-old home ground numbers about 3,000 according to the 2009 population census. At the advent of colonial period the Chepkitale Ogiek were treated as a different ethnic community to any other community on or around Mt. Elgon. They were given the misnomer of the Elgonyi or Mt Elgon Masaai or the dorobo or called ndorobo. There is one comment which must be made at this time to correct a common error in thinking and usage. In 1911 the colonial government gave the Ogiek their own Native Chief, called Sangulu. Laboot being the administrative Office of the Ogiek and the site of the Chief. The Land Carter Commission of 1932 still recognised the Chepkitale Ogiek as a distinct community. The people were even awarded its own native reserve called Chepkitale Native Reserve, a name derived from the Chepkitale hill. After Kenya's independence, Chepkitale Native Reserve was again officially recognized and was renamed The Chepkitale Trust Land. Origin of the problem The Ogiek (also still known as the Chepkitale people or as the ndorobo) were traditionally hunter-gatherers and pastoralist. Women used to and continue to practice weaving of bamboo handicraft. Their baskets taken to lower parts of Mt Elgon where they exchange for maize. In 1965 a plan was muted for the Ogiek to be assisted with farmlands for crop cultivation. They carried out a vote among themselves and agreed, subject to certain stringent conditions. The first condition was that they would retain their trust land (Chepkitale). Secondly, it the agreement was conditional on the Ogiek peoples being given land situated in the parts of Ramromwet, Kiboroa and Teldet and other adjacent land in the east. The Mount Elgon region leaders at the time, led by former M.P Hon Daniel Moss, and others went ahead with the programme and settled the Ogiek in Chepyuk. This was categorically against the wishes of the community and contrary to the second of the conditions mentioned earlier. In 1971 first settlement started. However, before this initial phase had proceeded far, discontent had already begun. The Sabaot Peoples had taken half the land, despite this community already having extensive coffee plantations covering all of their own traditional lands. The result of this, an occurrence not anticipated or even discussed during the original discussions which led to the agreement of some Ogiek elders to become settled agriculturalists, was that the community which was the very reason for the whole enterprise, the Ogiek, failed to get the necessary allocation of land. Discontent among the Ogiek was inevitable. There would have been no allocation of land whatsoever, and no resettlement scheme, if the administration had not wanted the Ogiek to become settled farmers. Now much of the land on which they were to be settled was awarded to a community which was not even party to the earlier discussions or agreements. This discontent continued unabated until 1989 when the government came intervened. The government attempted to correct the messy situation which had developed. The Provincial Commissioner Western Province at that time, Mr Francis Lekolool, saw that the process had been inequitable. His efforts, however, were short lived because he was transferred. The unfortunate result of Mr Lekolool's transfer was that the local District Commissioners and District Officers at that time made a serious error. They decided to commercialize the exercise. It cannot be avoided but to directly make clear that at least some of these administration officials were complicit in corruptly selling the land to other peoples who had no stake in the original agreement and already owned extensive real estate's elsewhere. The problems multiplied. The entire exercise was marred. Both the first and second phases of what was called the Chepyuk Settlement Scheme were fatally corrupted for several reasons: * Many people, notable several former district councillors ended up with more than four plots of land; they received double allocations. * There were, and continue to be, a large number of examples of other people having shares in a single allocations, i.e. people sharing the same plot. * There are people who have seven plots using same name, or presenting their names in different constructs, e.g. (though a fictitious example) Felix Sikuku Jones, Sikuku Jones Felix and Jones Felix Sikuku. * Children of school-going age were allocated land using the Identity Numbers of other people. * The land surveyors for some reason even allocated land plots directly on the banks of rivers and streams, with the result that there has been widespread soil erosion. * Unfortunately, the seemingly endemic Kenyan disease, corruption, was widely evidenced in both the surveying and allocation of land. It is, regrettably, unavoidable but to point accusing fingers at a wide range of so- called public servants, including: land surveyors, lands officers, former and serving local councillors, and even chiefs, district officers and some district commissioners. With yet more land needed as a result of the flawed earlier allocations, the so-called phase three (Chepkurkrur) scheme was hatched. In this phase land was to be shared on a fifty- fifty basis between the Ogieks and the Sabaots. Some of the Sabaot leaders were not happy with this decision and quickly organized for resistance and formed Sabaot Land Defence Forces that led to the biggest humanitarian crisis in Mt Elgon between 2004 and 2008. The result of the SLDF's targeted killings and plunder, is the displacement of over 100,000 people, over 1000 deaths, and uncounted injured and traumatized children, women and men. These are some of the ways in which the Ogiek suffered: ;Habitat/ housing The Universal Declaration of Human Rights article 25(1) states that ‚Äúeveryone has a right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself/herself and of his/her family, including food clothing housing and medical.‚Äù Part 25(2) of the Declaration says that ‚Äúmotherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance.‚Äù 90 per cent of the houses in Emia and Chepyuk locations, where Ogieks were burnt. ‚ÄúThe right of tenure over one‚Äôs home is very important because it is a precondition to everything else,‚Äù observed Executive Director UN-Habitat, Anna Tibaijuka. A conservative estimate of the number of houses (semi- permanent and permanent) destroyed puts the number at 15,000 houses, together with all their contents. The cost in money terms is put by observers as over 160 million KSh. A way of life and the sense of security of tens of thousands of people utterly destroyed. ;Food and clothing The food harvested in Chepyuk was either burned or looted by the militia group. Clothing was burned and bedding destroyed. Countless tons of food produce has lost. This is all contrary to The Universal Declaration of Human Rights article 26(1). The monetary value of the food lost as a result of looting and burning is independently estimated as exceeding 500 million KSh. ;Loss of life The Kenyan constitution sections 71 states that ‚Äúno person shall be deprived of his life intentionally.‚Äù Lives in Mt Elgon were lost, and those who killed acted without respect for age or gender. It is inevitable that disinterested observers view the work of the SLDF as tantamount to ethnic cleansing, or cultural genocide. Even after tackling the land issue there is need to set up a commission to look into the killings and for those behind the killings, and not just the killers themselves, to be dealt with according to the law. ;Education Article 26(1) of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that, ‚Äúevery one has the right of education‚Äù. The schools that the Ogiek children were attending at Laboot, Kipkama, Toboo at Chepkitale were left to rot by the Sabaot leadership. When the war started the Sabaot Children went to cheptais where there are schools while the Ogiek children had no school to attend at Chepkitale. The community had made request to the government to have schools in Chepkitale, but all has been vain. UNICEF, CDF officials, a schools inspector and several potential donor/supporters wanted and are willing to assist. Materials for construction of temporary classrooms were even been brought to the district. However, administration officials on the advice of former MP Mr Serut and the current MP have continually barred these operations. The community had proposed and continue to reiterate the proposal that temporary schools be erected in Tomoi, Kapchepkedta, Laboot and Toboo. ;Security Provision of security is the fundamental function of any government. Article 12 of The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that ‚Äúeveryone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.‚Äù The Ogiek suffered several attacks, among the worst was in October 1996 in Toboo area of Chepkitale where four people were killed, three injured and 1000 head of cattle, 5000 sheep and 200 donkeys taken by raiders. The armed raiders were erroneously believed to be Uganda soldiers. However, information garnered later confirmed that this had been an organized attack instigated and operated by members of the Cheptais Sabaot community. At the time, the Ogiek leaders informed the government that if it did not investigate and initiate ways to protect the Ogiek community, there was a real danger of a determined campaign of ethnic cleansing being undertaken against it and the use of the label ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù was inevitable. We wonder why the Government failed but we presume the following reasons: * The security issue was politicized ‚Äì as continues to be the case ‚Äì largely because virtually all Mt Elgon politicians are of Sabaot origin. * Certain elements of the in-situ security apparatus seemed to have been unable to work closely with National Security Intelligence Service. * There was a glaring lack of honesty and transparency on the part of certain government officials and politicians. * There was poor co-ordination within the government, a lack of joined-up- thinking, especially at the district level, but also even from the national perspective. * The militia question became a homegrown issue in Cheptais and few, if any, felt able or were prepared to provide information which would assist in undermining the SLDF * There was overt and covert support for the militia from many politicians and aspiring politicians, and even amidst members of the public services. The following recommendations will create lasting peace in the region. * There shall be a nullification of the gazettement of Chepkitale as a national game reserve and this area should revert to its original status of a Trust Land * The Ogiek people's rights to settle at their ancestral lands at Chepkitale should be protected. * There should be primary schools provided at Laboot, Toboo, Tomoi and Kapchepkelda areas of Chepkitale * Chepkitale should have a proper administrative infrastructure. The area should be made into a division, with three locations and a commensurate number of civic wards. * There should be a restoration of the original boundaries of Ogiek Peoples land of Chepkitale as it was delineated in the agreement of 1911. * Health facilities should be built at Laboot. * Security at Chepkitale should be enhanced by the setting up of a Kenya Police post, of administrative police posts, and the establishment of a General Service Unit camp at Laboot.

The town, situated south of the Nairobi Central Business District and west of the Ngong hills, lies 1,731 meters (5,682 feet) above sea level. According to the 2019 Census, it is the most populous town in Kajiado County and eleventh largest urban center by population in Kenya. Known locally as Rongai or simply Ronga, the populated town is a fast-growing community with an approximate population of 172,569 Ongata Rongai is also home to a vast number of commercial banks including Absa Bank Kenya, Equity Bank Kenya, Kenya Commercial Bank, HCF, Bank of Africa, Co-operative Bank, Sidian Bank, among many others. It also boosts healthcare by having renowned hospitals like Equity Afia Medical Center, The Karen Hospital, Aga Khan Hospital, Meridian Hospital, Nairobi Women's Hospital, Fatima Mission Nursing, Sinai Hospital, Kisima Hospital, KKIT Nursing Home and also Gertrude Children's Hospital. For a fancy night out one could check into the Legend Club located near the Supmarket area of Tuskys or also Nyasingawa Bar and Restaurant (N Bar) located at Tumaini. Origins Historically occupied by the Maasai community, the name Ongata Rongai is a Maasai phrase which translates to \\"narrow plains\\". Present-day Ongata Rongai grew from a meeting of a cattle market in the northernmost tip of Kajiado county and the quarry township in present-day Kware. The cattle market and the quarry spread rapidly and joined in the late 1950s. Due to rapid real estate development starting in the 1990s, Ongata Rongai has evolved into a high-population Nairobi suburb covering around 16 square kilometres. Greater Ongata Rongai is a medium-to-low population area. The neighborhoods of Kandisi, Rimpa, Nkoroi, Merisho, Olekasasi, Tuala, Rangau and Maasai Lodge are located to the south and east of Ongata Rongai. Ongata Rongai has a diverse population due to its proximity to Nairobi. Ethnic communities represented include Kalenjin, Maasai, Kikuyu, Kamba, Luhya, Luo and Kisii. Economy Ongata Rongai is a multi-class area which is however dominated by the middle class. Although largely located within Nairobi metropolitan, it does not fall within the administrative boundaries of the city and is separated from Nairobi city proper by the Mbagathi river. It is itself divided into two administrative locations, Nkaimurunya and Rongai, which are separated by the Magadi road. Within Ongata Rongai there is the Kandisi river, a tributary of the Mbagathi river. It has two major industrial ventures: Kitengela glass, an artefacts manufacturer tucked away in the far- flung Tuala township area, and Tam feeds, an agro-processing industry located in Gataka. Ongata Rongai has been surrounded by Nairobi National Park on the lower side of Mbagathi River. Modern shopping centers are also evolving in Ongata Rongai such as; Maasai Mall, Bees Park, Geomerc Centre, Times Acade, Great Wide Mall etc. Ronkai also have major shops i.e. Uchumi, Tuskys, QuickMat Supermarket, and Tumaini Supermarkets. Transport Ongata Rongai has a train station on the Nairobi‚ÄìMalaba Standard Gauge Railway, which was inaugurated in October 2019. Culture Notably, Ongata Rongai is famous for its customized public service vehicles operating on 125/126 route (otherwise known as 'nganya' or 'pimped matatus'). Such vehicles usually have animated graphics on the outer body while the inside is fitted with free wi-fi, numerous speakers and LCD screens for loud music surrounding. The 'Catalyst','Brain Freeze','Batman','Phantom 808' 'Vintage','Sparxx','Mack Truck' and 'Intoxicated' are rides that have come to be known as Nairobi's finest public service vehicles. Rongai is also the home of many known artists and celebrities, the likes of Royce, Sharama, Chiwawa, Baby t, X-tatic, DJ Mo, Ndavi and many more. Education The first school, Ongata Rongai Primary School, opened in 1949. This area is home to a number of institutions of higher learning, such as the Africa Nazarene University, Eagle Air Aviation College, Belmont International College (located at the junction of Magadi/Gataka road in Ongata Rongai Town), Adventist University of Africa, Nairobi Institute of Business Studies (NIBS College) and the nearby Multimedia University of Kenya in Mbagathi. Other learning institutions are Ongata Academy, Laiser Hill Academy, Azuri School Ltd Nkaimurunya Secondary School, Prime Junior School, Kunoni Educational Centre, Nakeel Primary, Nakeel Boys, Arap Moi Primary, Olekasasi Mixed School, and Maxwell Adventist Academy, which together with the Adventist University sit on the property of the headquarters of the Seventh-day Adventist Church for the East-Central African Division. There are also St. Mary's Primary School, Olerai School, P.C.E.A Educational Centre and the latest school in the region, The Champions Academy located at House of Grace Church Ongata Rongai; 300 meters from Laiser Hill School.  Cuisine  Ongata Rongai serves as a primary entry point where most fresh produce is transported directly to the towns from the farms. It has two major markets for fresh produce: one near Maasai Mall and another one near Kware. The large number of butcheries across Ongata Rongai also bear testimony to the popularity of beef in the town. Sellers of fresh fish are also making their presence felt, citing its immense benefits to the health of consumers. Sellers such as Let's Eat Fish Let's Eat Fish - Facebook focus on the elimination of middle-men and making quality and tasty fish more affordable for the consumers.

Lokitaung is the site of the 36-million year old Lokitaung Basalt lava flows, which lay atop Cretaceous sediments including dinosaur bones. The basalts are over 1 kilometer thick, and approximately 100 kilometers wide. Geography Lokitaung is located in northern Kenya near the Ethiopian border, and bounded by Lake Turkana to the east, and the larger part of the Labur range to the west. Lokitaung sits within a portion of range, is immediately inland and west of Lowarengak, south of Todenyang and north of Kangamajoj village. The Kachoda area lies to the northwest. Lokitaung is surrounded by extensive plains called Ngikalapatan in Turkana. Geology Nearby geological features include the Lokitaung Gorge and the Lubur Sandstone sedimentary sequence, more than thick. The Lubur Sandstone likely dates to the Cretaceous age of the Mesozoic, and includes dinosaur, turtle and crocodilian fossil bones. Turkana basalt columns, of the kind observed in the Lokitaung basalts. In the Lokitaung gorge, these sediments are overlain by over of basalt lava flows extending to the west of Lokitaung, called the Lokitaung basalts. Each flow is up to thick, and many display characteristic columnar jointing. The basalts have been dated to 36 million years ago, though it is apparent from other, nearby flows that volcanism continued after the Lokitaung basalts formed. While the Lokitaung basalts are thought to extend over latitudinally, their full range is not known. Similarities in age and composition between Lokitaung basalts on the west of Lake Turkana, and basalts from the Nabwal hills and formation on the east of the lake, suggest these two basalts were once much closer geographically. In the 36 million years since their formation, rifting may have subsequently separated them by as much as 25‚Äì90 km, depending on their original locations during eruption. Settlement Between 1913 and 1931, Sudanese troops operating in Northern Kenya and southern Sudan suffered from four outbreaks of Visceral leishmaniasis, or Kala-azar, including one in Lokitaung. The exact site of the outbreak was thought to be at the Moru-Yakippi watering hole, later called Loelli. In 1941, an outbreak of Kala-azar struck soldiers from the King's African Rifles while they were stationed in Nyeri, and after they had passed through Lokitaung. In the 1958-9, the British government placed a prison in Lokitaung, where Mau Mau prisoners reportedly received very harsh treatment. Accounts of cruel behavior and conditions reached the British press, who considered sending an investigative team. British colonial officials including Charles Ryland and Lennox-Boyde refused to allow any investigation or visit from the press. One British captain, E. Law, told British Labour MP John Stonehouse that British jailers were more sadistic than the Japanese who'd interned him \\"on the Burma-Siam Railway.\\" Political efforts to investigate the jail never succeeded. Today, Lokitaung prison grounds are used to host football matches by schoolchildren at Lokitaung and in surrounding communities. In 2011, Lokitaung was one of a number of villages throughout Turkana that suffered from starvation, caused by a drought and associated famine. Lokitaung includes a weather station operated by the Kenya Meteorological Department.

The settlement's inhabitants are traditionally pastoralists. Lokori is home to a number of prehistoric Namoratunga rock art and burial sites. Geography Lokori is located in southern Turkana District, south of Lake Turkana, and less than 1 kilometer southwest of the banks of the Kerio River. The town is south of Kitale, Lokichar and Loperot, northeast of South Turkana National Reserve, and located at the intersection of the C113 and C46 highways. The Loriu Plateau lies to the east. Geology Lokori is located in the Turkana Basin, a part of the East African Rift Valley. Sediments and volcanic rocks around Lokori in south Turkana range in age from 17 million years old to present. Volcanic activity appears to have occurred in 6 major instances of eruption. Ecology Ecologically, Lokori and the surrounding area are fairly representative of the habitats and land types found throughout southern Turkana. Annual precipitation has been measured at 283 mm, and is highly variable. Most rainfall occurs from March through May. Droughts are common in Lokori: in one 20-month period from 1979‚Äì81, only 149mm of rain were recorded. The region may be classified as a true semi-desert. Temperatures as high as 115 F have been recorded in nearby Suguta. Vachellia (ex Acacia) tortilis Lokori includes lava desert areas covered by basalt and sparsely vegetated by only a few Acacia reficiens, Euphorbia bush, Blepharis fruticulosa and grasses including Aristida mutabilis. Occasional water courses include a greater variety of plants including Acacia nubica, Acacia tortilis, Maerua oblongifolia, Salvadora persica, and grasses including Sporobolus and Chloris gayana. When lava outcrops are located within river vallies, boulders are interspersed by soil supporting rich vegetation including Adenium, Maerua, and Balanites. Lokori also includes alluvial flats characterized by large wadis, rivers, and flood zones anywhere from meters to kilometers in length. These flats are vegetated by thickets of Acacia nubica and by lesser quantities of Euphorbia, Blepharis, Carallumba dummeri and Jatropha villosa. Grasses in these flats include Aristida and Chrysopogon aucheri. The largest flats along the Kerio include denser vegetation including Coridia. Large areas around Lokori are dominated by stands or thickets of Salvadora, Cordia and Acacia tortilis. In the most densely vegetated areas along riverbanks and beneath Acacia tortilis stands, Withania somnifera, Maerua, Acyranthes aspersa and Cynodon dactylon can be found. Figs including Ficus sycamorus and the milkweed Calotropis procera are found. Tilapia and Clarias are found in the Kerio and Suguta rivers, and crocodile in the Suguta. Thirteen species of lizard have been recorded in the vicinity of Lokori, with reptilian biomass higher in more arid zones. Discovered species resemble Somali fauna. Mammals include baboons, black faced vervet monkeys, Grant's gazelle, leopard, silver- backed jackals, bat-eared fox, and striped hyena. Prehistory Namoratunga in Turkana, Kenya Two of three large Namoratunga rock art and cemetery sites found in Turkana are located just north of Lokori. Both sites are located on basalt lava outcrops, about 1 kilometer from one another. One site contains 162 burials, and the other contains 11. Each burial may contain over 10 tons of rock, and is composed of an outer circle of massive stone slabs rising up above the ground, and the interior of each circle is layered with horizontal stone slabs. Buried beneath the ground, a massive stone slab marks the entrance to underground burial pits. While females and children are buried at the sites, males constitute the majority of subjects, and only male graves are engraved. All those buried are oriented in one of the cardinal directions, and never in between. The Namoratunga sites contain a large quantity of engraved rock art, including geometric designs linked to branding symbols used by modern east African pastoralists. Domesticated cattle, sheep and goat teeth are found in most graves. The Namoratunga grave sites are unusual in the region and most similar to cairn constructions of southern Ethiopian cushitic peoples, including the Konso people. Radiocarbon measurements suggest the graves were made some time around 335 B.C. The Maasai people, though now living further south, are recorded to have lived near Lokori in the northern Kerio river valley as recently as 1400 A.D. Ceramic cultures associated with Nilotic people like the Maasai or Turkana may have first moved into the region between 450-1100 A.D., if not earlier. Ceramics belonging to these cultures are identified by \\"Turkwell Tradition\\" pottery characterized by repeated, deep horizontal grooves, and further grooves that radiate from these, likely produced by fish spines. Major Turkwell tradition sites in the region are Apeget and Lopoy both approximately 100 km north of Lokori, above the Turkwel River. Settlement Turkana people Today Lokori is settled by the traditionally nomadic and pastoralist Turkana people, with many belonging to the Ngisonyoka Turkana group. Pastoralists around Lokori typically raise camels, cattle, sheep and goats. These are a measure of wealth, and are also used to trade for cash or maize, or traditionally exploited for consumption of milk and blood. One regional study found that in 1980-85, pastoralists outside Lokori lost over 50% of their stock to drought, with cattle especially affected, and camels most resilient. The study found that Lokori pastoralists were able to regain pre-drought stock numbers after three years of normal rains. Consistent with patterns found in the tropics, a 1974 study investigating hepatitis B prevalence found that 12% of the Turkana people in Lokori tested positive for the HB ag antigen.

Assessing Trends and Policies of Foreign Direct Investment in the United States. Washington, DC: Invest in America, International Trade Administration, US Department of Commerce, 2008.(accessed October 16, 2008). Issues Inward Foreign Direct Investment in the United States Inward Foreign Direct Investment [FDI] constitutes 13.6% of US GDP.of Economic Analysis, Foreign Direct Investment in the United States According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the United States received $237 billion in FDI in 2007. In 2006, US affiliates of majority-owned foreign companies employed over 5 million workers ‚Äì 4.6% of US private sector industry employment [3]. Between 2003 and 2007, over 3300 projects have yielded $184 billion in investment or about 447,000 new jobs. The activities of these companies comprise approximately 19 percent of all US exports ($169.2 billion). Approximately 60% of all inward FDI goes to the service sector while 39% goes to manufacturing and the remaining 1% is in agriculture. This investment constitutes 12% of overall private sector employment.[3] In addition to contributing to total employment, US affiliates of majority owned corporations remunerate their employees at a higher level than US firms. Wages for workers this sector averaged $66,042 compared to the median income of $50,124 in other industries. Inward Foreign Direct Investment: Mergers and Acquisitions In 2006, there was a total of $161.5 billion of new Inward Foreign Direct Investment in the United States. Of this total, 91.5 percent was invested through Merger and Acquisition transactions. In a report for the Organization for International Investment,, Slaughter, Matt. Insourcing: Mergers and Acquisitions. Washington, DC: The Organization for International Investment, 2007, . (accessed October 16, 2008) Professor Matt Slaughter of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth cites three channels through which Mergers and Acquisitions create better performing firms: 1) Revenues ‚Äì Firms grow faster with new market opportunities often boosting employment and capital investment 2) Costs ‚Äì Can be lowered because of operation at larger scale and realizing synergies from combining best practices across companies 3) Diversification ‚Äì Gains can be realized, such as entering new markets and better managing ideas, internal capital markets, and risk. When the rationale for completing a Merger and Acquisitions is to improve the bottom line of the above factors, Slaughter argues, significant advantages are possible. However, when firms expand to pursue goals other than profit maximization the benefits of these transactions may be lost. Inward Foreign Direct Investment: Greenfield Projects While constituting a smaller percentage of total inward foreign direct investment flows, new projects or ‚Äúgreenfield‚Äù investments contribute to economic growth. Since 2003, Greenfield investments have increased 42 percent , Platzer, Michaela. The Impact on the U.S. Economy of Greenfield Projects by U.S. Subsidiaries of Foreign Companies. Washington, DC: The Organization for International Investment, 2008, http://www.ofii.org/docs/GREENFIELD_2007_Revised_Final.pdf. (accessed October 16, 2008). Greenfield projects are expected to create approximately 175,000 jobs from investments begun in 2003. Major investments come from Toyota Motor Company, the Hanjin Group, Adidas, the Tata Motors, and Vodafone. Total investment totals $109.5 billion [8]. In 2005, these companies spent $32 billion on research and development and $121 billion on plants and equipment.[8] Legislation Supported: * Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2013 (H.R. 2052; 113th Congress) - OFII supported this legislation, which would instruct the United States Department of Commerce to research and write a report on how the United States could increase its share of direct foreign investment. ** The bill would aim to create more jobs in the U.S. ** The chairman of the House subcommittee with jurisdiction over the bill said that \\"the legislation would identify and eliminate barriers to new jobs and would help make the United States more competitive in attracting foreign investment.\\"  References Further reading * Official Website of the Organization for International Investment ‚Äì http://www.ofii.org * Congressional Quarterly Barshay, Jill. 2005. \\"The New Kids On K Street.

For her labor, she earned $200 a week with room and board taken care of by the team, because the girls stayed with families during the regular season. Armstrong entered the league in with the Rockford Peaches, pitching for them in that season while she was still in high school. She posted a 4-1 record in six starts and three relief appearances.

Ethics or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that \\"involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong behavior\\". The field of ethics, along with aesthetics, concerns matters of value, and thus comprises the branch of philosophy called axiology. Various ethical theories pose various answers to the question \\"What is the greatest good?\\" and elaborate a complete set of proper behaviors for individuals and groups. Ethical theories are closely related to forms of life in various social orders. Origins The epic poems that stand at the beginning of many world literatures, such as the Mesopotamian Epic of Gilgamesh, Homer's Iliad and the Icelandic Eddas, portray a set of values that suit the strong leader of a small tribe. Valour and success are the principal qualities of a hero, and are generally not constrained by moral considerations. Revenge and vendetta are appropriate activities for heroes. The gods that appear in such epics are not defenders of moral values but are capricious forces of nature, and are to be feared and propitiated.T. Cahill, The Gifts of the Jews (New York, 1998), ch. 1; A. W. H. Adkins, Merit and Responsibility: A Study in Greek Values (Oxford, 1960). More strictly ethical claims are found occasionally in the literature of ancient civilizations that is aimed at lower classes of society. The Sumerian Farmer's Almanac and the Egyptian Instruction of Amenemope both advise farmers to leave some grain for poor gleaners, and promise favours from the gods for doing so.S. N. Kramer, The Sumerians (Chicago, 1963), 108. A number of ancient religions and ethical thinkers also put forward some version of the golden rule, at least in its negative version: do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself.J. Wattles, The Golden Rule (New York, 1996), ch. 1. Jewish ethics Since the origin of Ethical Monotheism in (Hebrew) Judaism, something Greek-sounding like \\"ethics\\" may be said to have been originated in Judaism's up to four thousand years old passed down traditions and instructions of the Torahs (Hebrew: , toroth; plural of Torah), Oral, Written,Birnbaum (1979), p. 630 and Mystical. Ancient Greek ethics Socrates, as portrayed in Plato's Republic, articulates the greatest good as the transcendent \\"form of good itself\\".Republic, Book VI The good, Socrates says, is like the sun. The sun gives light and life to the earth, the good gives knowledge and virtue to the intelligible world. It is the cause of goodness in people and actions, and it also is the cause of existence and knowledge. The pursuit of and love of the good itself (rather than any particular good thing) Socrates thought was the chief aim of education and (especially) of philosophy. In his personal life, Socrates lived extremely morally. He was chaste, disciplined, pious, responsible, and cared for his friendsCf. Symposium, Phaedo, and Republic, Book I In Gorgias he defends the notion that it is better to suffer injustice than to do it. The Greeks found this paradoxical, but Socrates both argued and lived this philosophy consistently. That is because the doing of evil damages the soul, which is the highest part of humans.Plato, Gorgias 475e. In the Republic, Socrates is challenged to defend the view that we have reasons to be moral that do not come from rational self-interest, in response to Glaucon's arguments in Book 2. The Republic develops the view that being a good person in an ethical sense involves achieving internal harmony of the parts of the soul. However, Plato's ethical ideal, as expressed in the Republic, still has much in common with the Homeric conception of the leader of a tribe or city: the successful running of the city and the internal harmony of the citizen who runs it is the main ethical aim, and there is little mention in Plato of any strictly moral obligations the ruler may be under. Aristotle's ethics builds upon Plato's with important variations. Aristotle's highest good was not the good itself but goodness embodied in a flourishing human life. His ethics are based on eudaimonia, variously translated as \\"happiness,\\" \\"prosperity,\\" \\"flourishing,\\" or \\"success.\\" A \\"great-souled\\" citizen who lives a life of virtue can expect to achieve eudaimonia, which Aristotle argues is the highest good for man. Following Plato, Aristotle gives a significant role in moral life to the virtues, fixed habits of behavior that lead to good outcomes; the main virtues are courage, justice, prudence and temperance. The highest form of life is, however, purely intellectual activity.J. O. Urmson, Aristotle's Ethics (New York, 1988.) Later Greek schools of philosophy, such as the Epicureans and Stoics, debated the conditions of the good life. Epicurus taught that the greatest good was pleasure and freedom from pain. The Epicureans emphasized the quiet enjoyment of pleasures, especially mental pleasure, free of fear and anxiety. The Stoics thought the greatest good not pleasure but reason and everything in accord with reason, even if painful. Hence they praised the life of reason lived in accordance with nature.W. O. Stephens, Stoic ethics in Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. A theme of Ancient Greek ethics then is the role of the virtuous life in achieving eudaimonia, or the good life; and Aristotle, Epicurus and the Stoics all argued that virtue was necessary for happiness, albeit in different ways and with different conceptions of those terms.Julia Annas, The Morality of Happiness. Oxford University Press, 1995. Christian ethics A passage of the Torah, \\"Love your neighbour as yourself\\" was taken up by the writers of the New Testament and made part of the theological centerpiece of the Christian ethical stance. In the New Testament Jesus teaches that all the commandments of Jewish religious law could be summarized in the two rules, \\"Love God and love your neighbour\\" (Mark 12:28-31). This is illustrated with the Parable of the Good Samaritan, which praises action to help any human in need. Natural law ethics In the Middle Ages, Thomas Aquinas developed a synthesis of Biblical and Aristotelian ethics called natural law theory, according to which the nature of humans determines what is right and wrong. For example, murder is wrong because life is essential to humans so depriving someone of it is inherently an evil. Education is needed for humans, and is their right, because their intellectual nature requires developing. Natural law theory remains at the heart of Catholic moral teaching, for example in its positions on contraception and other controversial moral issues.J. Finnis, Fundamentals of Ethics (Oxford, 1983). The Catholic practice of compulsory confession led to the development of manuals of casuistry, the application of ethical principles to detailed cases of conscience, such as the conditions of a just war.A.R. Jonsen and S. Toulmin, The Abuse of Casuistry: A History of Moral Reasoning, Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1990. Kantian ethics Immanuel Kant, in the 18th century, argued that right and wrong are founded on duty, which issues a Categorical Imperative to us, a command that, of its nature, ought to be obeyed. An action is only truly moral if done from a sense of duty, and the most valuable thing is a human will that has decided to act rightly. To decide what duty requires, Kant proposes the principle of universalizability: correct moral rules are those everyone could adopt.R. Johnson, Kant's moral philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy). Kant's philosophy marks a number of important conceptual shifts in philosophical thinking about ethics. Kant argues that questions about happiness should not be a focus in ethical thought, because ethics should be universal while happiness may involve very different modes of life for different individuals. He also believed this approach was necessary if an ethical theory was to avoid becoming 'heteronomous'; that is, locating the source of proper moral motivation outside of properly moral concerns. Utilitarianism In 19th century Britain, Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill advocated utilitarianism, the view that right actions are those that are likely to result in the greatest happiness of the greatest number. Utilitarianism remains popular in the twenty-first century.E.g. P. Singer, Practical Ethics (2nd ed, Cambridge, 1993). Both Kantianism and Utilitarianism provide ethical theories that can support contemporary liberal political developments, and associated enlightenment ways of conceiving of the individual. Twentieth century The early twentieth century saw many debates on metaethics, that is, philosophical theory on the nature of ethics. Views ranged from moral realism, which holds that moral truths are about mind- independent realities,R. Shafer-Landau, Moral Realism: A Defence (Oxford, 2003). to evolutionary ethics, which believes ethical practices are merely evolved ways of behavior that led to evolutionary success, to the error theory of J. L. Mackie, which held that the entire notion of ethical obligation is a mistake.J. Mackie, Ethics: Inventing Right and Wrong (New York, 1977). Reflections on the Holocaust, such as those of Hannah Arendt, led to a deepening appreciation of the reality of extreme evil. The Holocaust impacted other Jewish philosophers immensely, for instance, the post-war period saw Emmanuel Levinas develop his 'ethics of the other' and situate ethics as 'first philosophy'.B. Bergo, Emmanuel Levinas(Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy), Retrieved 11 November 2019. This philosophy showed a focus on the relation to the other in distress as central to the development of ethics and placed ethical theories center-stage in philosophy. Also in reaction to the Holocaust, rights theories, as expressed for example in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, asserted the inalienable moral rights of humans to life, education, and other basic goods. Another response to the atrocities of World War II included existential reflections on the meaning of life, leading to approaches to ethics based on \\"the situation\\" and personal interaction.For example, Simone de Beauvoir, The Ethics of Ambiguity. Citadel, 1949. In the late 20th century, there was a so-called 'aretaic turn' and renewed interest in virtue ethics. This turn is often traced to a paper by G.E.M. Anscombe entitled \\"Modern Moral Philosophy\\". This approach was then furthered and popularized by figures such as Philippa Foot, Alasdair MacIntyre, as well as Paul Ricoeur. The revival of this ethical position congruently saw a return to engagement with earlier philosophers associated with moral philosophy such as Thomas Aquinas Philippa Foot, Virtues and Vices (Oxford, 2002), pp. 13-14. and Aristotle. Alasdair MacIntyre, 'Moral philosophy and contemporary social practice', The Tasks of Philosophy Vol1: Selected Essays(Cambridge, 2006), pp. 109. The 1970s also saw a revival of applied ethics, the consideration of detailed practical cases in bioethics,R. Martensen, The history of bioethics: an essay review, Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences 56 (2001), 168-175. business ethics,T.F. McMahon, A brief history of American business ethics, in R. Frederick, ed, A Companion to Business Ethics, Oxford: Blackwell, 2002, pp. 342-52. environmental ethics, computer ethics and other special fields. The development of new technologies produced many new issues requiring ethical debate.

It is thought that the whittle and dub (a.k.a.

It is sometimes referred to as \\"Christofascism\\", a neologism coined by liberation theologist Dorothee S√∂lle in 1970. Interpretation of S√∂lle Tom Faw Driver, the Paul Tillich Professor Emeritus at Union Theological Seminary, expressed concern \\"that the worship of God in Christ not divide Christian from Jew, man from woman, clergy from laity, white from black, or rich from poor\\". To him, Christianity is in constant danger of Christofascism, stating that \\"[w]e fear christofascism, which we see as the political direction of all attempts to place Christ at the center of social life and history\\" and that \\"[m]uch of the churches' teaching about Christ has turned into something that is dictatorial in its heart and is preparing society for an American fascism\\". Christofascism \\"disposed or allowed Christians, to impose themselves not only upon other religions but other cultures, and political parties which do not march under the banner of the final, normative, victorious Christ\\" ‚Äì as Knitter describes S√∂lle's view. George Hunsinger, director of the Centre for Barth Studies at Princeton Theological Seminary, regards the conception of Christofascism as being an attack, at a very sophisticated level of theological discourse, on the biblical depiction of Jesus. He equates what is viewed as Christofascism with \\"Jesus Christ as depicted in Scripture\\" and contrasts it with the \\"nonnormative Christology\\" that is offered as an alternative by some theologians, which he characterizes as extreme relativism that reduces Jesus Christ to \\"an object of mere personal preference and cultural location\\" and that he finds difficult to see as not contributing to the same problems encountered by the Christian church in Germany that were noted by theologian Karl Barth. Christomonism Douglas John Hall, Professor of Christian Theology at McGill University, relates S√∂lle's concept of Christofascism to Christomonism, that inevitably ends in religious triumphalism and exclusivity, noting S√∂lle's observation of American fundamentalist Christianity that Christomonism easily leads to Christofascism, and violence is never far away from militant Christomonism. (Christomonism only accepts one divine person, Jesus Christ, rather than the Trinity.) He states that the over-divinized (\\"high\\") Christology of Christendom is demonstrated to be wrong by its \\"almost unrelieved anti-Judaism\\". He suggests that the best way to guard against this is for Christians not to neglect the humanity of Jesus Christ in favour of his divinity, and remind themselves that Jesus was also a Jewish human being.

Chris Hedges and David Neiwert contend that the origins of American Christofascism date back to the Great Depression, when Americans first espoused forms of fascism that were \\"explicitly 'Christian' in nature\\". Hedges writes that \\"fundamentalist preachers such as Gerald B. Winrod and Gerald L. K. Smith fused national and Christian symbols to advocate the country's first crude form of Christo-fascism\\". Smith's Christian Nationalist Crusade stated that a \\"Christian character is the basis of all real Americanism\\". Hedges also believes that William Dudley Pelley was another prominent advocate of Christofascism. By the late 1950s, adherents of these philosophies founded the John Birch Society, whose policy positions and rhetoric have greatly influenced modern dominionists. Likewise, the Posse Comitatus movement was founded by former associates of Pelley and Smith. The 1980s saw the founding of the Council for National Policy and the Moral Majority carry on the tradition, while the patriot and militia movements represented efforts to mainstream the philosophy in the 1990s. Incidents of anti-abortion violence, including the Atlanta and Birmingham bombings which were committed by Eric Rudolph and the assassination of George Tiller at his Wichita, Kansas church in 2009, have also been considered acts which were motivated by Christofascism. The term caused controversy in 2007, when Melissa McEwan, a campaign blogger for then-presidential candidate John Edwards, referred to religious conservatives as \\"Christofascists\\" on her personal blog. In the 2010s, the movement became linked to objectivism, particularly in the economic sphere, in direct contravention of such Biblical passages as Luke 16:19-31 and (especially) Matthew 25:31-46, prompting allegations of hypocrisy from progressive critics. Ayn Rand's name frequently came up during the 2012 U.S. Presidential election as the inspiration for the economic policies of the Republican Party.

Karolinum (formerly Latin: Collegium Carolinum, in Czech Karlova kolej) is a complex of buildings located in the Old Town of the City of Prague.Petr√°≈à (2010), p. 11 Karolinum, the seat of the Charles University, is one of the oldest dormitories situated in Central Europe. The dormitory was named after the Emperor Charles IV.  History  Shortly after the establishment of Charles University in 1348, the young institution encountered several organizational problems. One of the major complications was the lack of lecture and accommodation rooms for teachers and students. Emperor Charles IV, apparently inspired by the organization of the Sorbonne college in Paris and by the newly founded universities in Krak√≥w (1364) and Vienna (1365), decided to donate to the school a new college. In 1366, the university received the house of the Jew Lazar, located in the Prague's Old Town. However, the school was donated really representative rooms only in the early 1380s by Wenceslaus, the son of Charles IV. For this purpose, Wenceslaus chose a residence of the wealthy German merchant Johlin (Jan) Rotlev. Rotlev's son Martin (who financed the second oldest German translation of Bible) was closely linked with the court and supported the reformist tendencies of the university. Though it is known that Martin Rotlev inherited the palace, the way by which it passed into the possession of the university remains unknown. The coat of arms of the Rotlev family is a part of the decoration of an oriel window of the college.Petr√°≈à (2010), p. 17 In addition to the Rotlev Palace, King Wenceslaus also bought the surrounding buildings and rebuilt them for the purposes of the school. The architectural shape of Karolinum changed significantly during its history. In the early 18th century, it was rebuilt in Baroque style, according to the plans of the architect Franti≈°ek Maxmili√°n Ka≈àka.Petr√°≈à (2010), p. 39-41 However, the reconstruction was only provisional and the structural condition of the building in the following decades was very bad. In 1786, during a visit in Karolinum, the Emperor Josef II expressed his dissatisfaction with the state of the \\"seat of muses\\".Petr√°≈à (2010), p. 44 It was even planned to sell the building, but in 1802 it was decided that Karolinum would remain in the hands of the Charles University. The decision was apparently influenced by renewed romantic and patriotic enthusiasm, (regarding the historical building as a significant monument for education in Bohemia). From 1879 to 1881, several parts of the building were rebuilt in the Neo-Gothic style by the architect Josef Mocker. Following the World War I and the establishment of the Czechoslovak state, the buildings of Karolinum remained a property of the Charles University. Karolinum is a National Cultural Monument of the Czech Republic. The official publishing house of Charles University is named Karolinum.

He was a son of Luis de Requesens y Relat (d. 1426), baron of Altafulla and La Nou de Gai√†, both rural lands located in the Spanish province of Tarragona. He moved to the island of Menorca around 1439, because of disputes with the oligarchs of Catalonia since 1435, under King Alfonso V of Aragon. In December 1439 the king invested him as a baron of Molins de Rei and the Barcelona area known as Santa Creu de Olorda. He opposed the oligarchs with a pressure group of merchants and artisans known as La Busca. Forbidden to meet in the town of Barcelona, the Busca met outside the town, in Sabadell, Terrassa, Vilafranca del Pened√®s and Montcada. Acting as a royal agent, Lieutenant General of Catalonia, in November 1453 he suppressed the Barcelona Council. He had to go to clear these disputes and actions with King Alfonso V of Aragon, mainly residing near Naples, Italy since 1423, his estranged Spanish wife being till then a sort of royal representative of her husband king Alfonso, or governor of Catalonia, together with Alfonso's troublesome and restless brother, John, former prince consort of Navarre, later King John II of Aragon and the father of the later King Ferdinand II of Aragon and of the Navarrese inheritor of the kingdom, Prince Charles of Viana. In 1456 Alfonso V of Aragon, a.k.a. Alfonso I of Naples, awarded him feudal rights to the Italian towns of Trivento and Avellino. Before dying in 1458, Alfonso granted the status of nobility to Galceran and to his brother Bernat de Requesens y de Santa Coloma, but the \\"Biga\\" group they represented disputed John II's succession to his brother Alfonso, claiming new and old laws implemented along the Catalan counties' history. The \\"Biga\\" had supported the unfortunate Prince Charles of Viana, half-brother of the later king Ferdinand II, as a candidate to inherit the Navarrese throne. John II also claimed the Navarrese throne, something unacceptable to the Navarrese, as his having been prince consort of Navarre did not confer the right to succession. The defeat in 1461 of Charles, fighting against his father John, legal king of Aragon since 1458 on the death of his brother Alfonso V, led to the so-called capitulation of Vilafranca del Pened√®s and Charles's imprisonment by John, as well as to his premature death under suspicious circumstances. Galceran and his wife Elisabeta Joan de Soler, from Valencia, had 13 children, many of them entrepreneurs, international merchants and members of the Aragonese nobility settled there. Galceran de Requesens was eventually made destitute and went to prison for 108 days before being exiled to Valencia, where he died in 1465.

Wayne Wilson (born November 8, 1961 is a Canadian ice hockey coach and former player. He is currently the head coach of the NCAA Division I men's ice hockey team at Rochester Institute of Technology.  Playing career  Wilson grew up in Montreal but his family moved to Guelph, Ontario when he was sixteen. A defenceman, he played junior hockey for the Guelph Platers in the Ontario Hockey Association, then went on to college at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. He played four years (1980‚Äì1984) for the NCAA Division I Bowling Green Falcons, serving as captain in his senior year and leading the team to the 1984 national championship. He graduated with a degree in health, physical education, and recreation, then went on to get his master's degree in education from Bowling Green in 1987. While a grad student, he helped out as a part-time coach for the hockey team.  Coaching career  After graduating with his masters, he spent one year as an assistant at the University of New Hampshire under coach Bob Kullen, but Kullen fell ill and that left his job in jeopardy. Seeking stability, he accepted a position as an assistant coach at his alma mater in 1988, a position he held through the 1998‚Äì99 school year. During that time, the Falcons made three NCAA tournament appearances. Several players (Rob Blake, Nelson Emerson and Brian Holzinger) went on to successful careers in the National Hockey League.  Rochester Institute of Technology  In 1999, after five years of seeking a head-coaching position, he was hired to be head coach at Division III Rochester Institute of Technology. He led the RIT Tigers to a nearly-undefeated season in 2000‚Äì01; their only loss was on home ice in the 2001 national championship game. That year, he won the Edward Jeremiah Award for the top coach in Division III men's hockey. In his first six years at RIT, he compiled a 116‚Äì31‚Äì12 record (.767 winning percentage), with four ECAC West regular-season championships, three ECAC West tournament titles, and three NCAA tournament appearances. However, those all came in his first years at RIT; in 2003, the Tigers missed the D-III national tournament for the first time since 1995, and they would never return. In late 2004, despite a couple of \\"down\\" years for the program (including \\"only\\" a 13‚Äì7‚Äì5 record in 2003‚Äì04), RIT President Albert J. Simone announced that RIT would move their hockey program up to the Division I level, retaining Wilson as head coach. RIT would join Atlantic Hockey starting in the 2006‚Äì07 season. The rest of the 2004‚Äì05 campaign was rough, and the Tigers finished with their worst record of Wilson's tenure to date, including a painful loss to arch- rival Elmira College in which the Tigers squandered a late two-goal lead by allowing a pair of short-handed goals in the last three minutes of regulation. They would eventually lose in overtime 7‚Äì6. The Tigers' first season as a Division I program, in which they played as an independent was even harder, although the highlight was a home win over the St. Lawrence Saints (ranked #18 in the nation at the time) thanks to a 66 save performance by goaltender Jocelyn Guimond. The Tigers won only nine games that season, mostly against future Atlantic Hockey conference opponents. Since joining Atlantic Hockey in 2006, though, success has been the Tigers' hallmark. They won three regular- season conference championships in four years, and in 2010 they won their first conference tournament. That granted them the conference's autobid into the national tournament, where they stunned Denver and New Hampshire to win the East Regional and advance to the Frozen Four. In 2010, in recognition of reaching the Frozen Four, Wilson won the Spencer Penrose Award, for the top coach in Division I men's ice hockey. He became the first coach to win both the Spencer Penrose Award and the Edward Jeremiah Award. He also signed a five-year contract that year, keeping him at RIT until at least the 2014‚Äì15 season. During the 2014‚Äì15 season, Wilson led the Tigers to their second NCAA tournament appearance at the Division I level, where they knocked off the #1 overall seed Minnesota State Mavericks in the first round. Following the end of the 2014‚Äì15 season, Wilson signed a seven-year contract extension with RIT, through the 2022 season. During the 2015‚Äì16 season, Wilson led the Tigers to a third NCAA tournament appearance at the Division I level where they faced the #1 overall seed Quinnipiac Bobcats. Unlike the previous season, there would be no upset as the Tigers were shutout 4‚Äì0. In ten seasons of Division I play, Wilson has led the Tigers to several victories over nationally ranked teams. Under Wilson's tutelage, the Tigers have defeated at least one nationally- ranked team in nine out of ten Division I seasons. As Head Coach, 35 players went on to sign professional contracts. Notables include Steve Pinizzotto in 2007 who became the first RIT Tiger to sign an NHL contract at the Division 1 level. Chris Tanev signed with the Vancouver Canucks in June 2010 and became the first RIT alumnus to play in the NHL making his debut on January 18, 2011. He has also made his playoff debut in the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals suiting up in the Conference Finals for games 3, 4 and 5, and in the Stanley Cup Finals for games 5, 6 and 7. Tyler Brenner signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs in March 2011 on a two year entry level contract.  Personal life  Wilson and his wife Lynn live in Pittsford, New York. Their daughter Stephanie Konczos attended Bowling Green State University, and their son Stu Wilson (who played ice hockey for Yale) is a professional ice hockey player. Head coaching record ^RIT was ineligible for the postseason in their first year of conference play.

He made his reputation by being an early pioneer of foundation consolidation (soil) by pressure grouting. The company began its reputation as a notable engineering firm when they were contracted to perform the foundation work for Bagnell Dam on the Osage River in central Missouri. Bagnell Dam was completed in 1931 and is one of two operational hydroelectric power plants in the State of Missouri, the other being Taum Sauk Hydroelectric Power Station. Bagnell Dam formed a fresh water reservoir named Lake of the Ozarks, which, at the time, was one of the largest Man-made lakes on the planet. The foundation and dam structure was engineered to retain 646,000,000,000 US gal. In 1966 the company was incorporated as the Judy Company, Inc.

It lies within the North Devon local government district. At the time of the 2001 Census, the village had 203 inhabitants. Molland was first referenced as the Manor of Molland in the Domesday Book. The village contains a church dating back to the 1400s. Geography The northern boundary of the parish rises to 1,239 feet at Round Hill on Molland Common; its southern border mostly follows the River Yeo (a tributary of the River Mole), and part of its north-eastern border defines the county boundary with Somerset. The parish is surrounded, clockwise from the east, by the Devon parishes of West Anstey, a small part of East Anstey, Knowstone, Bishop's Nympton and Twitchen. The population of the parish was 203 in 2001, down from 397 in 1901. The village lies on minor roads about 4 miles north of the A361 road between Bampton and South Molton. History A scatter of tumuli near Round Hill on Molland Common provide the earliest evidence of humans in the parish. A pollen analysis published in 2004 suggests that during the Romano- British period Molland Common was dominated by a pastoral economy with woodland, possibly managed, restricted to the steep-sided valleys. The evidence shows that the land continued in use for pasture until the 10th century when there was a marked increase in the cultivation of cereals. The researchers concluded that this change probably indicates an increase in population, and they pointed out that the evidence is consistent with the introduction of convertible husbandry, a type of land-use management not otherwise documented until the 1500s. Medieval manors The first documentary evidence for Molland appears in the Domesday Book of 1086. The Manor of Molland was a medieval manor, largely co-terminous with the existing parish of Molland. More accurately it consisted from the earliest times of two separate manors, held from separate overlords, later known as Molland- Bottreaux and Molland-Champson. Molland-Bottreaux was held from the 15th to the 18th centuries by the Courtenay family, while Molland-Champson was held by the Culme family for about 200 years until it was sold to the Courtenays in 1703. The unified manor passed to the Throckmorton family and continued in existence as a large private estate under the ownership of Clare McLaren- Throckmorton (1935-2017).Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.792 In 2009 the estate comprised 6,250 acres, 1,700 of which are accounted for by Molland Moor, and includes 40 residential properties forming most of Molland village, 13 farms, the London Inn public house and additional land lettings.Acreages per Proof of Evidence of C.E.

Records of a mine named Brimley show that over 10,000 tons of iron ore were mined between 1881‚Äì3 and 1887‚Äì9.Burt et al. pp. 19‚Äì20 The surviving records of Molland Mine show that over 1,700 tons of copper ore, valued at more than ¬£9,300 were mined between 1845 and 1867; the same mine produced a total of over 20,000 tons of iron ore, valued at more than ¬£5,000, between 1877 and 1893.Burt et al. pp. 84‚Äì85 In comparison, the total UK output of iron ore in the late 1880s was around 14 million tons per annum.Burt et al. table 10, p. xxviii Both mines were owned by the Molland Mining Co. The maximum number of employees at Brimley was recorded as 26 (18 of whom were working underground) in 1891, and at Molland Mine, 30 (22 underground) in 1889‚Äì90.Burt et al. pp. 20, 85 Around 1800 the farmer Francis Quartley of Great Champson did much to save and improve the breed of red Devon cattle.

Lecturer of Molland After her husband's death Margaret Giffard (d.1743), the widow of John V Courtenay (d.1732), the last of the Courtenays of Molland, instituted a lectureship at Molland-cum- Knowstone parish and endowed it with the great tithes of the manor.Lysons, Magna Britannia (1822), Vol.6, Devon, Parishes: Molland; White's Devon Directory of 1850 stated however: \\"In 1721, they (great tithes) were vested in trust by Thos. Clarke, for the support of a lecturer (or curate,) and that office is now filled by the Rev. Joshua Bawden, B.A., of South Molton\\". Thomas Clarke left two houses and 15 acres of land called Leddons, for the relief of the poor and schooling poor children, which were in 1850 producing rental income of about ¬£20 a year.(White's Devon Directory of 1850) Recorded holders of the office include: *Rev.

In 1760 he moved to Ottery St Mary, where he served as vicar and Master of the King's School. By his wife Anne Bowden (1726‚Äì1809) (probable daughter of John Bowden, Mayor of South Molton in 1726), he was the father of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge.Unsworth, John, The Early Background of S.T. Coleridge, published in The Coleridge Bulletin, No 1, Summer 1988, pp 16‚Äì25 *Rev. Richard Bawden (1779). In his Episcopal Visitation Return of 1779, the then incumbent, Rev. John Froude, stated that the Rev'd Richard Bawden was a Lecturer at Molland \\"who has the Great Tithes of the Parish\\".\\"I reside in the Vicarage House at Knowstone being consolidated with Molland. There is a Lecturer at Molland, The Rev'd Richard Bawden, who has the great Tithes of the Parish. He preaches one Part of the Day. I preach one Part of the Day at Creacomb, a very Small Church adjoining Knowstone\\".Chanter 232A, 25 *Rev. James Gould (1737‚Äì1793).

Joshua Bawden (1850). In 1850 the office of Lecturer was held by Rev. Joshua Bawden, B.A., of South Molton.White's Devon Directory of 1850 West Molland Barton West Molland Barton, viewed from north West Molland Barton was the manor house of the manor of Molland Bottreaux, and was thus the residence of the Courtenay family. It is situated about 1 mile west of the parish church, beyond Champson Barton, and though apparently Georgian has Tudor features incorporated at the back.Pevsner, N. (1952) North Devon.

Molland Lily Lilium pyrenaicum growing wild on a hedgebank in the parish of Molland, where it is known locally as the \\"Molland Lilly\\" Many of the remote hedgerows within the parish contain isolated clumps of Lilium pyrenaicum, which is native to the Pyrenees Mountains and other mountainous regions at a similar latitude. The plant was discovered by the French botanist Antoine Gouan (d.1821) and was officially recorded in 1875.North Devon Journal, 2 September 2010 \\"Alison's attempt to solve the mystery of the Molland Lily\\" The plant is thought by some to have been introduced by members of a religious community. possibly when local monks brought back seeds from Spain in medieval times.

Biography Gislesen was born in Bergen, Norway. She was the sixth of eight children born to Niels Andreas Vibe (1759‚Äì1814) and Margery Kierulff (1775‚Äì1852). Her father served as County Governor of Nordre Bergenhus Amt. Gislesen was a sister of Ludvig Vibe, sister-in-law of Heinrich Arnold Thaulow and second cousin of Ludvig C√¶sar Martin Aubert. When she was two years old, her family moved to Christiania in 1811 when her father was made General War Commissioner of Norway. Gislesen's father died when Henriette was five years old and her family established residence with Benoni Aubert (1768‚Äì1832) who was married to a cousin of her mother. Gislesen settled in Eiker near Drammen where she lived from 1844-53. In 1851, she came into contact with Andreas Hauge, son of Hans Nielsen Hauge and founder of the Norwegian Missionary Society. Subsequently she became involved in missionary work. Together with Gustava Kielland, Gislesen was one of the most important spreaders of missionary interest among women. After some years she also debuted as a moralistic writer. In 1843 she released the book En Moders veiledende Ord til sin Datter (\\"A Mother's Guiding Words to her Daughter\\"). Gislesen also wrote poems and stories that were published in newspapers and magazines. Like most female writers in her contemporary, she wrote anonymously. In time, Gislesen used her real name and published several books including textbooks for missionaries. Her memoirs were published posthumously in 1861, and a collection of her letters was published in 1885. Personal life Gislesen was married twice. In April 1829, she married her second cousin, Christian Frederik Gl√ºckstad (1803-1838). He died after nine years of marriage in 1838. In 1854, she married clergyman Knud Gislesen (1801-1860).

It was built in 1942 as one of several ammunition storage facilities located far enough inland to be safe from Japanese attack, yet close enough to western military posts and ports to facilitate shipment of supplies. The site also met the requirement that the depot be in a dry and isolated area. Introduction Designated as a Center for Industrial and Technical Excellence (CITE) for all Petroleum and Water Systems, and Operational Project Stocks, Sierra Army Depot (SIAD) provides a unique readiness platform to the Total Army and Joint Force. SIAD performs a wide variety of long-term logistics and sustainment missions, ranging from equipment receipt and asset visibility to long-term care, storage and sustainment, to repair/reset of all Army fuel and water systems. The depot is a subordinate of US Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command (TACOM), offers an enterprise-wide competitive solution to logistics challenges, and fills a critical void in materiel and equipment management nearing the end of its first life. These unique operations provide a readiness and operational value to the Department of Defense through management and controlled redistribution of this equipment. SIAD is highly experienced with equipment reset, new assembly/kitting operations, training operations, maintaining operational project stocks, and a redistribution mission for Class VII and Class IX items. It has established an End-of-First Life Center for combat and non-combat vehicles. SIAD supports similar functions for Organizational Clothing and Individual Equipment (OCIE) and Central Management Office (CMO) to receive, identify, classify, receipt/record clothing for multiple agencies such as the Program Execution Office, the CMO, the Defense Logistics Agency, and the US Air Force. The depot can process \\"excess\\" OCIE from these agencies and various Clothing Issue Facilities (CIFs) as well as returned items from Southwest Asia, including posts, camps and stations. These capabilities have enabled the depot to become a consolidation and distribution center for the CMO, supporting brigade level OCIE reset operations and the US Army Reserve CIF. The depot also repairs defective ESAPI plates at a considerable cost savings to the Army. The depot is the primary storage site of mothballed F-22 Raptors. It also houses over 30,000 fittings, jigs, and other tooling related to the production and maintenance of the F-22 for the planes still in service and for any possible future needs. The depot and Anniston Army Depot will be the storage sites of the US Marine Corps' inventory of M1 Abrams tanks as well as other armored equipment as part of USMC Commandant Gen. David H. Berger's planning guidance \\"Force Design 2030\\". The last tanks left for the depot from the U.S. Marine Corps' base at 29 Palms in California in July 2020. Capabilities and mission execution Sierra Army Depot was established in 1942 as an ordnance and general supply storage depot. Over the years, SIAD has adapted to changing conditions by becoming home of operational project systems. Today, SIAD offers a range of unique logistics, sustainment and maintenance capabilities. Capabilities include: * Certified in both ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management and ISO 14001:2015 Environmental Standard; on track to become a Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) Star-certified installation. * More than 36,000 buildable acres. * 10,000-foot runway capable of supporting military and commercial aircraft. * Experts in assembly and kit configuration management, packaging and containerization of military unique systems. * Continuously invests in process improvement to refine and advance core competencies of logistics, rapid deployment and industrial operation. * Executes the receipt, accountability, storage, care of supplies in storage, reset, upgrades, system configuration, kitting and assembly and worldwide shipping on a number of programs, to include Army Prepositioned Stocks, Force Provider, wholesale stocks and various fleet commodities. * Serves as a central management location for item and program-managed wholesale stocks and assets; receives, records, classifies, stores, maintains, sustains and ships material on owners' direction; total visibility of assets and materials to determine disposition and analyze future requirements. * Modern organic transportation network, capable of supporting all military and commercial aircraft, rail and trucks able to respond immediately to all requirements worldwide. * Preservation and packaging prototyping. * The Army's largest dedicated retrograde facility for equipment and material returning from units and theater; performs logistics management on a majority of the agency's non- Army managed items, Army-managed items, and returned Class IX equipment for reutilization and redistribution with guidance from item and program managers. * Manages a majority of the Army's retrograded Nonstandard Equipment (NSE); receives, identifies, classifies, inventories, stores, secures, inspects, packages and ships worldwide. * Receives, identifies, classifies, inventories, stores, secures, inspects, packages and ships worldwide, a large volume of the Army's OCIE items. * Manages excess Class VII major end items in its combat vehicle and equipment End-of-First Life Center; more than 20,000 combat vehicles and equipment items stored for item managers; receives, identifies, classifies, inventories, stores, secures and ships assets; performs controlled parts' harvesting for production lines, active Army units, and foreign military sales. Industrial skills and facilities With more than 1,000 structures, SIAD'S buildings include igloos, warehouses and maintenance buildings. Containerization and assembly: The depot's kitting and assembly capability includes prototyping configuring, inspection and assessment of returns, replacements, preservation and packaging, equipment testing, containerization and shipment. Container rotator: The rotator is used as an efficient way to rotate ISO, TRICON and MILVAN shipping containers, reducing the total handling time from several hours to 20 minutes, and reducing manpower needs for container logistics support. End-of-First Life Center: SIAD's combat vehicle End-of-First Life Center includes equipment consolidation surveillance and inspection, prepositioned stock, care of supplies in storage, asset and inventory management, regeneration programs for end items and subcomponents, upgrades and redistribution, configuration management, kitting and system assembly/disassembly. Maintenance: SIAD's maintenance personnel are able to facilitate mechanical repairs, corrosion control, metal fabrication and repairs. Retrograde, reutilization and redistribution: The largest organization at SIAD, the reclamation and redistribution facilities receive retrograde materials from southwest Asia, Europe and posts, camps and stations across the US. Transportation: SIAD is recognized for its transportation capabilities because of its airfield, its joint air operations training and the improved logistical support to the Warfighter.

He played representative level rugby union (RU) for England, Yorkshire and Durham, and at club level for Hull FC, Hull Kingston Rovers (two spells), and West Hartlepool, as a wing, or centre, i.e. number 11 or 14, or 12 or 13, and club level rugby league (RL) for Hull Kingston Rovers (Heritage ‚Ññ). Prior to the 1895‚Äì96 season, Hull F.C. was a rugby union club, and prior to the 1897‚Äì98 season, Hull Kingston Rovers was a rugby union club. Background Sammy Morfitt was born in Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, his birth was registered in Sculcoates district, and he died aged 85 in Kingston upon Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. Playing career=International honours Morfitt won caps for England (RU) while at West Hartlepool in 1894 against Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, and while at Hull Kingston Rovers in 1896 against Wales, Ireland, and Scotland. In the early years of rugby football the goal was to score goals, and a try had zero value, but it provided the opportunity to try at goal, and convert the try to a goal with an unopposed kick at the goal posts. The point values of both the try and goal have varied over time, and in the early years footballers could \\"score\\" a try, without scoring any points. Change of Code When Hull Kingston Rovers converted from the rugby union code to the rugby league code for the 1897/98 season, Sammy Morfitt would have been approximately 28 years of age. Consequently, he was both a rugby union and rugby league footballer for Hull Kingston Rovers. Note Sammy Morfitt's surname is variously spelt correctly with a 'o' as Morfitt, or incorrectly with a 'u' as Murfitt.

D. Dasan Std. VI B is a 2010 Malayalam film written and directed by Mohan Raghavan and produced by Paul Vadukumcherry.The film deals with a child's desire to see his father, and the beginning is made when he gets a clue from a piece of paper he finds in his mother's trunk. The wanderings of the boy's mind and the real unravel of world which is a mix of dreams, desires and the present are portrayed in the movie. The film features Master Alexander, Biju Menon, Jagadish and Shweta Menon in the lead roles. Master Alexander won the Best Child Actor award in an online poll conducted by The Times of India. The film opened in Kerala theatres on 9 April 2010 to universal acclaim. It was screened at various international film festivals and has garnered several awards. Despite all the acclaim, the film performed poorly at the box office. T. D. Dasan Std. VI B was the only film directed by Mohan Raghavan who died a year after the release of the film. Plot T. D. Dasan (Master Alexander) is a young boy who lives with his mother (Shwetha Menon). His father had left them years back when Dasan was one year old. Dasan gets his dad's address from his mother's old trunk box and writes him a letter. Dasan's father had moved out of that address and the letter reaches the current resident Nandakumar Poduval (Biju Menon), an Ad film maker who lives with his thirteen-year-old daughter Ammu (Tina Rose) at Bangalore. Nandan requests Ammu's caretaker Madhavan (Jagadish) to find out the whereabouts of the person and deliver the letter to him. But Madhavan is not that enthusiastic and the letter ends up in the waste bin. Ammu sees this and feels bad about it. She starts writing replies to Dasan, as if they were written to him by his dad. The young boy is excited at the thought of having found his dad, and shares all his feelings and needs with his dad. Ammu promptly replies with pens and other gifts Dasan asked his father. Later Dasan's mother gets to know this and gets shattered by this news. Nandakumar also gets to know this news and becomes furious at his daughter, revealing that Dasan's father had actually died months ago while suffering from jaundice. He now wants to meet Dasan, apologize and tell him the truth. Dasan's mother was later found dead under mysterious circumstances. When Nandakumar comes to meet Dasan, he understands that Dasan is now an orphan, who was now under the care of his uncle Raman Kutty. Dasan meets Nandakumar, who now sees him as his father. Nandakumar first thinks of leaving the place without Dasan but changes his mind soon after.

Budget constrains heavily limited the marketing of the movie, with the film ending up as a minuscule release. The collection was hardly noticeable. The film was initially adjudged the Golden Pheasant Award for Best Film at the International Film Festival of Kerala 2010. However, it was decided to award a foreign film after some jury members felt that giving the award for a regional film will diminish the interest of foreign delegates in IFFK. The issue was revealed by actor P. Sreekumar in a press conference, which garnered wide criticism from the Malayalam film fraternity against the IFFK. The film was one of the two South Indian films screened at the 11th New York Indian Film Festival (NYIFF 2011).\\"The way to New York\\". The Hindu. 22 April 2011.

In June 2011, Reuters reported that the Iraqi government had issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Al Uzri, stemming from an investigation into the Bank. As yet no details of the allegations, or any supporting evidence have been presented. In the same year Mr. Al Uzri featured in The Middle East Magazine's 'Top 50 Arabs'. During Hussein Al Uzri‚Äôs stewardship, TBI grew from nothing to the largest bank in Iraq. It issued almost all government letters of credit, which in Iraq's state-driven economy was a substantial number. Investigations by Iraq's government claimed the bank was troubled, despite regular auditing and annual reporting, the latest of which was published in 2010 on the Bank's website and was audited by PWC. Though state-owned, Mr. Al Uzri successfully operated the Bank commercially, overseeing a number of landmark successes and achievements. Mr. Al Uzri previously worked at Card Tech for 20 years in banking, commercial and project management across the Middle East, Europe and the former Soviet Union (FSU). Between 1992 and 2000 Mr. Al Uzri worked in Moscow as manager of INPASS, a joint venture between Finland‚Äôs OKO Bank and UK financial technology firm CTL. In this capacity Mr. Al Uzri was responsible for the introduction of a number of financial services in the FSU including the first VISA cards (1992), the first Electronic Point of Sale machines (1992), and the first Automatic Teller Machines (1993). From 2000-2003 Mr. Al Uzri was CTL's general manager for the Former Soviet Union and the Middle East, based at their London headquarters. Al Uzri is a 1985 graduate of Texas Tech University, where he received a degree in electrical and computer engineering. Achievements at TBI Under the stewardship of Mr. Al Uzri the Trade Bank of Iraq quickly developed into a highly credible and effective organization. In a short period of time, TBI built relationships with an international network of 134 prime banks covering 63 cities in 39 countries. This gave TBI a global reach, a competitive advantage and the ability to provide a diverse range of services. By the end of 2010 TBI‚Äôs equity was US$1.5 billion and the Bank had total assets of over US$15 billion. Profits at the Bank in 2010 were $361 million. Early success saw TBI sign agreements with 17 of the largest Export Credit Agencies in the world, making it one of the first Iraqi banks to receive lines of credit from major international financial institutions. Among the many 'firsts' the bank can claim are the introduction of Iraq's first fully automated online banking system, the first Iraqi bank to issue VISA credit cards, and the development of the first nationwide network of ATMs. Building on early success, Mr. Al Uzri‚Äôs leadership introduced modern, innovative products and services to the Iraqi market. These included Project Finance, Salary Accounts, Savings Accounts, and Credit Cards. In 2011 TBI employed over 450 people, operating across fifteen branches throughout Iraq. More than 5,000 Letters of Credit (L/Cs) had been issued by early 2011 totalling US$65 billion. TBI was voted ‚ÄòBest Trade Bank in the Middle East' by the Trade and Forfeiting Review in 2007, 2008 and 2010. Under Mr. Al Uzri, TBI engaged EY, and subsequently PWC, to audit the Bank‚Äôs systems and annual results. EY carried out this function for five years and PWC for two (2009 and 2010). No concerns were raised regarding the bank‚Äôs operations and results and reports were published on TBI‚Äôs website. Following the removal of Al Uzri in 2011, the Prime Minister‚Äôs office appointed Mrs. Hamdia Al Jaf, a close friend of the Al Maliki family, to take over leadership of the Bank. Formerly a branch manager at Radifain Bank, Al Jaf‚Äôs tenure has become synonymous with TBI‚Äôs decline. The Bank has not published an annual report since 2010 and its operations are considered to be mysterious. Since 2011, no financial statements have been published by independent auditors. The bank has lost its semi-independent status and is now under the direct control of the Prime Minister's office.
