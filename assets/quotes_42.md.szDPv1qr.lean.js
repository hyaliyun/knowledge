It is composed of three villages: Colonia Reconstruc»õia (Bohntelep), Feldioara and Rotbav (Rothbach; Sz√°szveresmart). At the 2011 census, 88.8% of inhabitants were Romanians, 6.9% Hungarians and 3.5% Roma. It has a medieval fortress long believed to have been built by the Teutonic Knights. However, more recent studies show that the Fortress in Feldioara was actually constructed by the local community. The name of the village comes from the Hungarian word f√∂ldv√°r, which means \\"the clay fortress\\". The ruins of the fortress can still be seen today. The German name Marienburg means \\"fortress of the Virgin Mary\\".

The fortress withstood the Turkish invasion of 1421, but it was severely damaged by a second invasion in 1432. It took until 1457 to restore it. During the battles of 1612, the armies led by Prince Gabriel B√°thori conquered the fortress, and in September the Bra»ôovian armies had Feldioara under siege for three days. On September 16, 1612 a battle was fought between the Hungarians, led by B√°thori, and the Bra»ôovians, led by mayor Michael Weiss. The Bra»ôovians lost the fight, and Michael Weiss was killed on the battlefield. The fortress - long out use for its original purpose - was used as a granary until 1838, when a major earthquake damaged it. After this event, even the fortress guardian left the building. Since then the fortress has lain in ruins.

All member organisations are united in pursuit of one single humanitarian goal, \\"Preventing loss of life in the world's waters\\". History The first International Lifeboat Conference was held in London, England, in 1924. The conference, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, was attended by seven of the world's lifeboat organisations. It was unanimously decided by the attendees that an International Lifeboat Federation (ILF) should be established to promote, represent and support sea rescue services around the world. In 1985, the ILF was formally registered as a \\"non-governmental consultative organisation\\" by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the United Nations specialised agency for international maritime affairs. Back in 1924, before modern radio communication or rescue helicopters were in common use, coastal maritime rescue was almost always provided by small rescue craft operated by local communities. These rescue craft were traditionally referred to as \\"lifeboats\\", before the alternate meaning‚Äîthe emergency evacuation craft carried on larger ships‚Äîbecame common. As technology developed, so too did maritime rescue. Most developed countries have centralised Maritime Rescue Coordination Centres, which can instantly receive maritime distress calls and co-ordinate rescue response using a range of modern maritime communication and positioning systems and search planning computers. Modern Rescue Coordination Centres have a broad range of well equipped rescue assets at their disposal, which are manned by highly competent crews. Rescue response would include modern surface search and rescue units, rescue helicopters and fixed-wing search aircraft as well as a range of other specialised rescue and casualty treatment teams. The ILF played an important part in IMO's Global Search and Rescue Plan, following the adoption of the 1979 SAR Convention, and in the evolution of the Global Maritime Distress Safety System. In 1998, the ILF was awarded the International Maritime Prize of the IMO, the first time it had been awarded to an organisation rather than an individual. In order to reflect this broader scope of modern maritime rescue activity, carried out by its member organisations, and to remove any ambiguity over the alternate meaning of the word \\"Lifeboat\\", the International Lifeboat Federation decided to change its name to International Maritime Rescue Federation in 2003, the process being completed in 2007. Operation Today, the International Maritime Rescue Federation represents more than 90 organisations, from the world's largest maritime rescue services to new start- up organisations, which come from over 60 different countries all around the world. The organisation is run by a small secretariat based in Stonehaven, Scotland and the DGzRS head of operations, Udo Helge Fox is chair of the trustees, with Bruce Reid as chief executive. The most recent World Maritime Rescue Congress was held in Bremerhaven, Germany, in June 2015, devoted particularly to establishing a draft Code of Practice for the operation of search and rescue craft. Maritime Incident Response Groups Maritime Incident Response Groups (MIRGs) are specialized units of the IMRF responsible for containing disasters while at sea, most notably on-board ship fires.

Located in the western part of Udham Singh Nagar district, it is Kumaun's third most populous city and the sixth most populous in Uttarakhand. According to the 2011 Census of India, the population is 121,623 for the city of Kashipur and 283,136 for Kashipur Tehsil. Historically part of Kumaun, Kashipur is named after Kashinath Adhikari, the founder of the township and governor of the pargana, one of the officers of the Chand Kings of Kumaun in the 16th and 17th centuries.Kashipur town The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 15, p. 71. Kashipur remained under the rule of Chand Kings until the latter half of eighteenth century until Nand Ram, the then governor of Kashipur, became practically independent. Kashipur was ceded to British in 1801, after which, it played a major role in the conquest of Kumaon during the Anglo-Gorkha war in 1815. After Kumaun was ceded to the British under the Treaty of Sugauli, Kashipur became the headquarters of Terai district in the Kumaon division. The Municipality of Kashipur was established in 1872, and was upgraded to a Municipal Corporation on 26 January 2013. Kashipur Kings * Raja Mahendra Chand (Old Raja of Kumaon) * Raja Lal Singh * Raja Guman Singh (First Raja of Kashipur) * Raja Shiv Raj Singh * Raja Hari Raj Singh * Raja Uday Raj Singh * Raja Hari Chand Raj Singh (Again got the throne of Almora from his elder brother Raja Andand Singh) History Vishnu Trivikrama, an 11th-century Pratihara stone sculpture from Kashipur Ruins of the ancient city of Govisana Kashipur was known as Govishana, during the time of Harsha (606‚Äì647 AD). The ruins of the large settlement of those days can be still seen near the city. The famous Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang also travelled the city in the 7th century. He described it as \\"The Capital was 15 li in circuit. Its position was lofty, and of difficult access, and it was surrounded by groves, tanks and fishponds\\". Kashipur is believed to have a good historic trade of clothes and metal vessels. The modern town of Kashipur was founded by Kashinath Adhikari, the governor of Tarai under King Devi Chand of Champawat. Later Raja Mohan Chand ; one the Kings of Kumaon's younger brother Lal Singh was given the estate Kashipur and Raja Guman Singh became its first King. Kashipur's last king Raja Hari Chand Raj Singh again got back the titular throne of Kumaon in British India as Raja Anand Singh (Raja of Almora) had no issues. The exact date of the foundation of the town is disputed, several historians having expressed their own views on the matter. Bishop Heber, in his book Travels in India wrote that Kashipur was founded by a deity named Kashi 5000 years back (approx 3176 BC). Sir Alexander Cunningham invalidated his views in his book, The Ancient Geography of India, in which he wrote \\"the good bishop was grossly deceived by his informant, as it is well known that the town is a modern one, it having been built about AD 1718 by kashi-nath, a follower of Raja Devi- Chandra of Champawat in Kumaon\\". Badri Datt Pandey in his book Kumaun Ka Itihaas, contradicting Cunningham's views, claimed the town to be founded in 1639. Kashipur remained under the rule of Chand Kings until the latter half of eighteenth century until Nand Ram the governor of Kashipur became practically Independent and established his kingdom at Kashipur. When the British arrived in Kumaun at the end of the 18th century AD, Kashipur was ruled by King Shib Lal, the second King of Kashipur. Kashipur was ceded to the British by Shib Lal in 1801 after which it became a revenue division. Bishop Heber visited here during his travel to Almora in November 1824. Heber described Kashipur as a \\"famous place of Hindu Pilgrimage\\". On 10 July 1837, Kashipur was included in the Moradabad district. The revenue divisions of muradabad district were rearranged in 1944 following which Bajpur, Kashipur and Jaspur were rearranged into one pargana named as Kashipur. Bajpur was brought under Tarai district in 1859 followed by Kashipur in October 1870. Kashipur was later made the headquarters of Tarai district in the Ceded and Conquered Provinces. Geography The Dronasagar Lake during sunrise At , and northwest of New Delhi, Kashipur is located in the south-west of the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand in the Terai ‚Äì an area of relatively low-lying land, ranging between 500 and 1,000 feet (150 and 300 metres) above sea level and crossed by Kumaon's main north-south watershed between the basins of the Rivers Ramganga and Kosi. To the north of the city lies the Bhabar tract of Ramnagar, which separates the area from Shivalik Hills. Kashipur is drained only by minor rivers and lakes, primarily by Dhela river, a tributary of River Ramganga. Several rivers and stream cross the region transversely and leave their deposit making the land fertile. However, these also dissect the region which renders it unfit for agriculture. Kosi is the master stream flowing in the western part with its broad course from north to south. LocationGeology Geologically, Kashipur is dominated by the Terai tract, which runs horizontally through the city from Jaspur in the west, passing through the city center, to Bajpur and Rudrapur in the east. Terai formation consists of clays, sandy clays, fine to medium sand and occasional gravels. In this formation there is a dominance of clayey successions over sandy horizons. There are damp and marshy tracts in places. It is the zone of seepage where fine sand, silt and clay are deposited by the emerging streams. Almost level and fertile soil along with high water table has rendered the belt useful. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone 4, in a scale of 2 to 5 (in order of increasing vulnerability to earthquakes). Climate Clouds hovering over the city Kashipur has a humid subtropical climate, like much of the Indo-Gangetic Plains to its south, with average maximum temperatures in summer (June) being around ; and in winter (January) around . The driest month is November, with 5 mm of rain. With an average of 374 mm, the most precipitation falls in July. There is a difference of 369 mm of precipitation between the driest and wettest months. During the year, the average temperatures vary by 17.1 ¬∞C. The main seasons are summer from March to June, the monsoon season from July to November and winter from December to February. The climate of Kashipur is characterized by relatively high temperatures and evenly distributed precipitation throughout the year. In summer, Kashipur is largely under the influence of moist, maritime airflow from the western side of the subtropical anticyclonic cells over low-latitude ocean waters. Temperatures are high and can lead to warm, oppressive nights. Summers are usually somewhat wetter than winters, with much of the rainfall coming from convectional thunderstorm activity; tropical cyclones also enhance warm-season rainfall in some regions. The coldest month is usually quite mild, although frosts are not uncommon, and winter precipitation is derived primarily from frontal cyclones along the polar front. The K√∂ppen climate classification subtype for this climate is \\"cwa\\". But in the recent years kashipur has witnessed a drastic change in weather and its climatic conditions due to increase in construction in the nearby regions also due to overpopulation and increase in demand by people for the region's resources. due to this we have seen that the trees are cut due to which average temperation is increasing. also the most popular lake in the girital region has alao dried up. Demographics As per provisional data of 2011 census Kashipur had a population of 121,623 roughly equal to the nation of Kiribati, out of which males were 63,625 and females were 57,985. Since 2001, the population has grown by 28,656, or 30.8%. The population density is 57,693 inhabitants per square mile (22,275/km¬≤) compared to the 490 inhabitants per square mile (189/km¬≤) for Uttarakhand. In 1881, Kashipur had a population of around 14,000 people. By 1981, this had increased to 50,000 as a result of hill people migrating to the area in search of jobs and education. Population of children with age of 0‚Äì6 is 14835 which is 12.20% of the total population of Kashipur. In Kashipur, the female sex ratio is 912 against the state average of 963. The child sex ratio in Kashipur is around 862 compared to the Uttarakhand state average of 890. The literacy rate of Kashipur city is 82.45%, higher than the state average of 78.82%. In Kashipur, male literacy is around 86.88% while female literacy is 77.63%. Hinduism is the largest religion within Kashipur, with 62.37% of residents identifying as Hindus in the 2011 Census. The city's religious profile is highly diverse, Kashipur has a large number of people from Muslim, Sikh and Christian communities. Islam is second most popular religion in city of Kashipur with approximately 35.06% following it. In Kashipur city, Christianity is followed by 0.34%, Jainism by 0.11%, Sikhism by 1.87% and Buddhism by 1.87%. Approximately 0.25% of the population were either atheists or followed 'no particular religion'. The major language spoken in the city is Hindi with a Garhwali influence. The Kashipur Tehsil had a population of 283,136 in 2011. In addition to Kashipur itself, the tehsil includes the towns of Mahua Kheraganj and Kachnal Gosain, along with 73 other villages. Government and politics The Kashipur Municipal Corporation is in charge of the civic administration of the city. It was formed in 2013, by upgradation of the erstwhile Kashipur Municipal Council. The Municipality of Kashipur was constituted in 1872. Kashipur is divided into 20 wards for election purposes. The Kashipur Municipal Corporation is run by a city council composed of 20 Councillors, representing each of the wards of the city. Elections to the council are held once every five years, with results being decided by popular vote. Members contesting elections to the council usually represent one or more of the state's political parties. The mayor is also elected from among the elected members of the council; the seat being reserved for a female belonging to the Other Backward Class. Elections to the Kashipur Municipal Corporation were held in 2013, and Usha Chaudhary, an Independent politician was voted into power. Chaudhary defeated Ruqsana Ansari from Congress by 7418 votes. Economy Agriculture is the main economic activity in the region. Fertile land, coupled with water availability, makes the region an intensively cropped area. Apart from Rice and Wheat, major produces are sugarcane, mango, guava, jamun, jack fruit and litchi. Large number of farmers in this region are actually settlers from outside, having land holdings in excess of five acres. government has allotted agricultural plots to refugees around Garhi Negi village and to the hill people at Maldhan village. Historically, Industrial activities in the region were very small scale and agriculture based. Later, with administrative encouragement and support, rapid industrial development took place around Kashipur town. About 603 industrial units were functioning in the town, as reported by the Kashipur 2011 Master Plan. These included 163 Cottage industries, 415 small scale industries, and 25 medium (or large) Industries. Industrial development coupled with rich agricultural cash crops practices made this area more prosperous, relative to other parts of Kumaon region. The region accounts for almost 50% of the medium and large scale industries in the district. Major Industrial units, mostly located on Kashipur-Thakurdwara road, include Surya Roshini Limited (Bulbs and Tubes), India Glycols limited, Kashi Vishwanath Steels limited, Jindal Solvents extraction limited, DSM Sugar mills limited, Naini Papers limited, SRF limited and Shriram extraction private limited etc. Large industrial houses such as Flexituff International Ltd, IGL, HCL Technologies, Videocon, Pasupati Arcylon Limited etc. also have branch establishments in the city. Kashipur is becoming a thriving industrial center, as the city is suited for industrial park projects with cost of living compared to metros. Because of cheap and abundant raw materials available, several paper and sugar mills already have a presence in the city.

The city is served by the National Highways NH 309 and NH 734. The NH 734 (formerly NH 74) connects to Najibabad via Jaspur and Nagina, while the NH 309 connects Kashipur to Rudrapur in the east, and the cities of Ramnagar and Srinagar to the north. Pantnagar Airport (IATA: PGH, ICAO: VIPT), located east of the city in the University town of Pantnagar, is the only major airport in the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand. It has a single runway, which is in length and is capable of handling a turboprop aircraft. Airline services exist to Delhi and Dehradun. The nearest international airport is the Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi which is away. Kashipur Junction railway station (KPV) is connected to Ramnagar, Kathgodam, Moradabad, Bareilly, Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, Mumbai, Chandigarh, Agra, Jaisalmer, Haridwar and Delhi by rail network. Kashipur Railway Station is under the administrative control of the Izzatnagar division of the North Eastern Railway zone of the Indian Railways which currently serves the city. Several new Rail links have been planned for the city. The Kashipur-Najibabad rail line has been surveyed by Indian Railways. This line would be used to connect Tanakpur with Dehradun. Another important line is the Ramnagar-Chaukhutia rail link, which will be critical in bringing Gairsain to the rail network. Local public transport in Kashipur is co-ordinated by Uttarakhand Transport Corporation. Inter-City Bus routes are mainly operated from the Kashipur Bus Station by UTC, UPSRTC K.M.O.U and G.M.O.U, though there are several other, smaller registered bus companies. Auto rickshaws serve during the fairs and fates in large numbers. E-Rickshaws, also known as Mini Metro, have now established themselves as the leading source of travelling within the city.

Together with TU Dresden and VEB Spurenmetalle Freiberg, ZMD formed the foundation for Silicon Saxony, a cluster of microelectronics companies that came to include new fabs by Siemens (later Infineon Technologies) and AMD (later GlobalFoundries).  1961: Arbeitsstelle f√ºr Molekularelektronik (AME)  The company was founded in 1961 in Dresden under the leadership of Werner Hartmann as a research institute with the goal of developing technologies for manufacturing integrated circuits, following the seminal patents by Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce two years earlier. Initially, it was named Arbeitsstelle f√ºr Molekularelektronik (Department of Molecular Electronics) and reported to the government's Office of Nuclear Research and Technology. In 1965 the institute was moved to the combine VVB Bauelemente und Vakuumtechnik which was responsible for manufacturing almost all electronic components in East Germany at the time. The researchers manufactured their first p‚Äìn junction in 1966, their first fully working bipolar junction transistor in 1967, and their first integrated circuit C10 (a four-input NAND gate with 7 transistors) in a 20 ¬µm process and with a yield of 16% in April 1968. Later that year in September the test chip C30 (two four-input NAND gates, 14 transisotrs, equivalent to the 7400 series 7420, 10 ¬µm process) achieved a yield of 30%. Under the designation D120C this design was later transferred for volume production to Halbleiterwerk Frankfurt (Oder) and publicly announced at the Leipzig Trade Fair in the spring of 1971, together with subsequent chips in the 7400 and 74H00 series. image:AME- Eingang-2011.jpgThe original AME office (as it looked in 2011) image:AME- Diffusionsofen.JPGOven for doping semiconductor materials (1965) image:AME- Neunfach-Repeater.JPGPhotolithography device (1967) image:4-fach- NAND-C10.JPGIntegrated circuit C10 (1968)  1969: Arbeitsstelle f√ºr Molekularelektronik Dresden (AMD)  Integrated circuit D200C (equivalent to 74H00), manufactured by AMD in August 1970 In 1969 the institute was renamed to Arbeitsstelle f√ºr Molekularelektronik Dresden (AMD).

When Erich Honecker replaced Walter Ulbricht as the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany in 1970, the new economic doctrine of the ‚Äúunity of economic and social policy‚Äù lead to a sharp reduction in investment in the microelectronics industry (in 1974 only 68.4% of its 1970 value). In 1973, AMD was forced to implement a \\"staff reduction policy\\". This course was reversed only in 1977. In 1973, AMD produced the first working samples of the PMOS integrated circuit U820D for electronic calculators (6000 transistors, 6 ¬µm process). By 1974, AMD had grown to 950 employees. Prof. Hartmann, who had led the institute since 1961, was forced to leave by the Ministry for State Security in 1974.  1976: Institut f√ºr Mikroelektronik Dresden (IMD)  Integrated circuit with the IMD logo The name of the institute changed again in 1976, this time to Institut f√ºr Mikroelektronik Dresden (IMD). In 1978, VVB Bauelemente und Vakuumtechnik was split into VEB Kombinat Elektronische Bauelemente Teltow for passive electronic components and VEB Kombinat Mikroelektronik Erfurt for active electronic components, IMD becoming a part of Kombinat Mikrolektronik Erfurt. The development of dynamic RAM at IMD, that would ultimately result in the much-publicized Megabit Chip (see below), began with the 1-kilobit chip U253 (a clone of the Intel 1103). The U253 was publicly announced at the Leipzig Spring Fair 1977.  1980: VEB Zentrum f√ºr Forschung und Technologie Mikroelektronik (ZFTM)  Asynchronous 8-bit processor slice U830C with the ZFTM logo By combining Institut f√ºr Mikroelektronik with VEB Elektromat Dresden (producer of semiconductor manufacturing equipment) in 1980, ZFTM was formed. In 1986, ZFTM was moved from Kombinat Mikroelektronik Erfurt to the East German optics and technology combine Kombinat Carl Zeiss Jena.  1987: VEB Forschungszentrum Mikroelektronik Dresden (ZMD)  The development of dynamic RAM at ZMD continued with the 16-kilobit U256 and the 64-kbit U2164. First laboratory samples of the U2164 were obtained in 1981. In 1984 the U2164 was presented at the Leipzig Spring Fair. Pilot production at ZMD started in 1986. In 1988 mass production of the U2164 began at VEB Mikroelektronik \\"Karl Marx\\" Erfurt. For comparison, internationally 64-kbit chips became available commercially around 1980. The pilot production of the 256-kbit U61256 started in 1988, and the 1-Mbit U61000 followed in 1989. Neither of those two could be transferred to mass production until German Reunification in 1990. About 35,000 U61000 were manufactured in 1988 and 1989. Production of the U61256 sufferred from an industrial accident in July 1989 and the yield dropped from an already low 6.1% to below 1%. The development of the megabit chip U61000 was much publicized at the time as proof of the capability of East German industry and the socialist system in general. Kombinat Carl Zeiss Jena used the U61000 to advertise its semiconductor manufacturing equipment. For this reason the U61000 bore the Carl Zeiss Jena logo while most other integrated circuits from ZMD kept the previous ZFTM logo. image:ZFTM U2164C S1.jpg64-kbit dynamic RAM U2164C and U2164D image:CarlZeissJena U61000C 1.jpg1-Mbit dynamic RAM U61000CC12 image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1988-0912-400, Berlin, √úbergabe der 1-Megabit-Speicherschaltkreise.jpgLead developer Jens Knobloch presents a 1:300 scale drawing of the megabit chip to state leaders Erich Honecker and G√ºnter Mittag (12 September 1988)  1993: Zentrum Mikroelektronik Dresden GmbH (ZMD)  Digital signal processor U320C20, manufactured in 1991 Following the German reunification in 1990, ZMD, together with other companies of the former Kombinat Mikroelektronik Erfurt, became part of a holding company under the name PTC-electronic AG which was 100% owned by the Treuhandanstalt. In 1993, ZMD was privatized as ZMD GmbH which was de facto owned by the Freestate of Saxony. The goal of the state government was to preserve ZMD as the core of the microelectronics industry in Saxony. While this goal was achieved for the industry as a whole (see Silicon Saxony), ZMD continued to accumulate losses. The number of employees fell from 575 in 1993 to 434 in 1998. In order to both avoid a bancruptcy of ZMD and further losses for the freestate, ZMD was transferred to Sachsenring AG for the symbolic price of 2 Marks in 1998.  2000: Zentrum Mikroelektronik Dresden AG (ZMD/ZMDI)  Logo of ZMDI from 2009 to 2015 In December 2001 the company changed its corporate form to Aktiengesellschaft. With the sale of its foundry to X-FAB Semiconductor Foundries AG in 2007, ZMD became a fabless semiconductor company. Since May 2009, ZMD AG used the logo ZMDI while the company name remained Zentrum Mikroelektronik Dresden. In 2006, the company had 625 employees of which around 250 were engineers. By 2008, the numbers has shrunk to 320 employees including 150 engineers. ZMDI innovations were used in automotive and industrial electronics, medical technology and for infrared interfaces (IrDA), for example in mobile phones and laptops. The company had specialized in the design, production and marketing of heavy duty, mixed analogue-digital, application-specific circuits (ASICs) and systems on chip (SoC) with low energy consumption. The main focus of these developments were applications for the automobile sector, going back to the link with Sachsenring AG. In December 2015 ZMDI was acquired by IDT.

(2005). Viruses and the Evolution of Life. Washington, ASM Press. A latent viral infection is a type of persistent viral infection which is distinguished from a chronic viral infection. Latency is the phase in certain viruses' life cycles in which, after initial infection, proliferation of virus particles ceases. However, the viral genome is not eradicated. The virus can reactivate and begin producing large amounts of viral progeny (the lytic part of the viral life cycle) without the host becoming reinfected by new outside virus, and stays within the host indefinitely.N.J. Dimmock et al. \\"Introduction to Modern Virology, 6th edition.\\" Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Virus latency is not to be confused with clinical latency during the incubation period when a virus is not dormant.  Mechanisms = Episomal latency  Episomal latency refers to the use of genetic episomes during latency. In this latency type, viral genes are stabilized, floating in the cytoplasm or nucleus as distinct objects, either as linear or lariat structures. Episomal latency is more vulnerable to ribozymes or host foreign gene degradation than proviral latency (see below). One example is herpes virus family, Herpesviridae, all of which establish latent infection. Herpes virus include chicken-pox virus and herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2), all of which establish episomal latency in neurons and leave linear genetic material floating in the cytoplasm. The Gammaherpesvirinae subfamily is associated with episomal latency established in cells of the immune system, such as B-cells in the case of Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus. Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus lytic reactivation (which can be due to chemotherapy or radiation) can result in genome instability and cancer. In the case of herpes simplex (HSV), the virus has been shown to fuse with DNA in neurons, such as nerve ganglia or neurons, and HSV reactivates upon even minor chromatin loosening with stress, although the chromatin compacts (becomes latent) upon oxygen and nutrient deprivation. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) establishes latency in myeloid progenitor cells, and is reactivated by inflammation. Immunosuppression and critical illness (sepsis in particular) often results in CMV reactivation. CMV reactivation is commonly seen in patients with severe colitis. Advantages of episomal latency include the fact that the virus may not need to enter the nucleus, and hence may avoid nuclear domain 10 (ND10) from activating interferon via that pathway. Disadvantages include more exposure to cellular defenses, leading to possible degradation of viral gene via cellular enzymes. Reactivation may be due to stress, UV, etc.  Proviral latency  A provirus is a virus genome that is integrated into the DNA of a host cell. Advantages include automatic host cell division results in replication of the virus's genes, and the fact that it is nearly impossible to remove an integrated provirus from an infected cell without killing the cell.Marcello A. \\"Latency: the hidden HIV-1 challenge.\\" Retrovirology. 2006 Jan 16;3(1):7 A disadvantage of this method is the need to enter the nucleus (and the need for packaging proteins that will allow for that). However, viruses that integrate into the host cell's genome can stay there as long as the cell lives. One of the best-studied viruses that does this is HIV. HIV uses reverse transcriptase to create a DNA copy of its RNA genome. HIV latency allows the virus to largely avoid the immune system. Like other viruses that go latent, it does not typically cause symptoms while latent. Unfortunately, HIV in proviral latency is nearly impossible to target with antiretroviral drugs.  Maintaining latency  Both proviral and episomal latency may require maintenance for continued infection and fidelity of viral genes. Latency is generally maintained by viral genes expressed primarily during latency. Expression of these latency-associated genes may function to keep the viral genome from being digested by cellular ribozymes or being found out by the immune system. Certain viral gene products (RNA transcripts such as non-coding RNAs and proteins) may also inhibit apoptosis or induce cell growth and division to allow more copies of the infected cell to be produced. An example of such a gene product is the latency associated transcripts (LAT) in herpes simplex virus, which interfere with apoptosis by downregulating a number of host factors, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and inhibiting the apoptotic pathway. A certain type of latency could be ascribed to the endogenous retroviruses. These viruses have incorporated into the human genome in the distant past, and are now transmitted through reproduction. Generally these types of viruses have become highly evolved, and have lost the expression of many gene products. Some of the proteins expressed by these viruses have co-evolved with host cells to play important roles in normal processes.  Ramifications  While viral latency exhibits no active viral shedding nor causes any pathologies or symptoms, the virus is still able to reactivate via external activators (i.e. sunlight, stress) to cause an acute infection. In the case of herpes simplex virus, which generally infects an individual for life, a serotype of the virus reactivates occasionally to cause cold sores. Although the sores are quickly resolved by the immune system, they may be a minor annoyance from time to time. In the case of varicella zoster virus, after an initial acute infection (chickenpox) the virus lies dormant until reactivated as herpes zoster. More serious ramifications of a latent infection could be the possibility of transforming the cell, and forcing the cell into uncontrolled cell division. This is a result of the random insertion of the viral genome into the host's own gene and expression of host cellular growth factors for the benefit of the virus. In a notable event, this actually happened during gene therapy through the use of retroviral vectors at the Necker Hospital in Paris, where twenty young boys received treatment for a genetic disorder, after which five developed leukemia-like syndromes. This is also seen with infections of the human papilloma virus in which persistent infection may lead to cervical cancer as a result of cellular transformation. In the field of HIV research, proviral latency in specific long-lived cell types is the basis for the concept of one or more viral reservoirs, referring to locations (cell types or tissues) characterized by persistence of latent virus. Specifically, the presence of replication-competent HIV in resting CD4-positive T cells allows this virus to persist for years without evolving despite prolonged exposure to antiretroviral drugs. This latent reservoir of HIV may explain the inability of antiretroviral treatment to cure HIV infection.

His artistic career started in 1945 with entering the Copenhagen Academy of Arts, where he studied in the classes of the Professors Kr√¶sten Iversen (1886-1955), Olaf Rude (1886-1957) and Axel J√∏rgensen (1890-1963). In the early fifties he discovered characteristic motif cycles, which were to influence all of his work. From then on he mostly devoted himself to painting scenes from his immediate surroundings, which he transferred directly onto canvas on site. Eisner showed particular interest in the long-established Danish forest park \\"Dyrehaven\\", which offered the painter a wide repertoire of motifs for years. He also was interested in motifs of the popular amusement parks \\"Tivoli\\" and \\"Bakken\\" as well as in scenes from his personal surroundings in Frederiksberg and views of the island of Bornholm. Other pictographic themes which were constant factors in Eisner's paintings are still life and the Danish traditional \\"Sankt Hans Fire\\". Ib Eisner worked mostly in picture series to explore the nuances of changes of lighting moods and seasons. French Impressionist theme and composition techniques are noticeable not only in his preferred method of operation, the plein-air painting, which from this point on the artist applied in all weather conditions, but also in the treatment and application of colour. These alternate between the fluent, almost sketchy application of colour with thinned oil paints and a paste-like, relieflike flow, deliberately trying to reveal the artistic facture. Eisner applied pure, mostly unmixed colours next to each other in quick brushstrokes, creating a vibrant structure of bright tones and developing an original picture-intrinsic dynamic. He painted mostly without fixed contour lines or preparatory drawings, since the capturing of elusive lighting effects required swift work. With these painting tools, the artist created a unique atmosphere characteristic to each picture. Ib Eisner's works were purchased by art associations for the promotion of fine arts as well as banks and companies in Denmark, Norway and Sweden and by private collectors. His international recognition is evident through the sale of his paintings to Germany, Sweden, Japan, Great Britain and the United States.  Literature  Weilbach - Dansk Kunstnerleksikon, ed.

Other interests Rupert is a former cricketer and founded the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation in 1990. Laureus funds 65 projects globally, with the goal of using sport to tackle social issues, having a particular emphasis on underprivileged children. He co-founded the Sports Science Institute with his friends Morne du Plessis and Tim Noakes. Rupert also developed the Gary Player designed, Leopard Creek Golf Club in Mpumalanga, South Africa which is one of South Africa's top three golf courses, and rated number 25 outside the United States of America (Golf Digest). He has also played in the annual Gary Player Invitational golf tournament to assist fellow South African and friend Gary Player raise funds for various children's charities. He serves as Chairman of the South African PGA Tour and Chairman of the South African Golf Development Board. In 2007 he was elected into South African Sports Hall of Fame and in 2009 was inducted into South African Golf Hall of Fame. Following his younger brother Anthonij's death in a car accident in 2001 he took over the L'Ormarins wine estate. Anthonij, was head of Rupert & Rothschild Vignerons. Rupert initiated a project to enhance the farm in memory of his late brother. He was council member of The South Africa Foundation and trustee of the Southern African Nature Foundation, The Institute of Directors in Southern Africa, Business South Africa and Die Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns and Managing Trustee and member of the investment committee, Nelson Mandela Children's Fund. He served on the Daimler Chrysler International Advisory Board. Following in the footsteps of his father, Anton, Johann Rupert is also a committed conservationist. In addition to conserving about 25,000 hectares in the Graaff Reinet area, he is also Chairman of the Peace Parks Foundation. Controversies When the British design magazine Wallpaper* described the Afrikaans language as \\"one of the ugliest languages in the world\\" in its September 2005 edition (in reference to the Afrikaans Language Monument), Rupert responded by withdrawing advertising for his companies' brands such as Cartier, Van Cleef & Arpels, Montblanc and Alfred Dunhill from the magazine. In December 2016, it was reported that Rupert had dropped Bell Pottinger as the PR agency of Richemont, accusing Bell Pottinger of running a social media campaign against him, to divert attention away from persistent 'state capture' allegations levelled at the Gupta family. In September 2017, Rupert, during Richemont‚Äôs annual general meeting in Geneva, described the use of the term \\"Radical Economic Transformation\\" by Bell Pottinger as \\"just a code word for theft‚Äù, in order to cover up the \\"State Capture\\" by their clients, the notorious Gupta family. Radical Economic Transformation is a policy championed by President Jacob Zuma to reduce racial inequality in South Africa. In 2018 Rupert caused some controversy in South Africa for comments he made during an interview with PowerFM. He was criticised for denying the alleged existence of white monopoly capital, his account of the process of Afrikaner economic- upliftment, and for comments he made regarding the saving habits of black South Africans. Following the incident Rupert issued an apology for his comments. The controversial leader of the Black First Land First party Andile Mngxitama stated afterwards that Rupert's comments were a reason to commit violence against white South Africans.

Early history The origins of the Singakademie are difficult to discern because the group was initially intended as a private gathering of music lovers and only later became a public institution. The Singakademie grew out of a small circle of singers who met regularly in the garden house of the privy councillor Milow. Their weekly meetings seemed to have resembled those of the then popular Singethees. Carl Friedrich Zelter describes them as rather informal meetings: \\"One gathered in the evening, drank tea, spoke, talked, in short entertained oneself; and the matter itself was only secondary.\\"Carl Friedrich Zelter: Selbstdarstellungen. ed. by Willi Reich, Zurich 1955. p. 64. Singer and songwriter Charlotte Caroline Wilhelmine Bachmann was one of the original founding members. Until the early nineteenth century, most musical concert and opera performances consisted of the music of living composers. The Akademie was intended by Fasch to revive music of the past as well as to perform that of the present. In fact its first performance was a 16-part Mass by Fasch himself, but it also regularly performed music by J. S. Bach and other earlier masters. Fasch had been a pupil of Johann Sebastian Bach's son C. P. E. Bach and instilled the devotion to Bach that has been a continuing feature of the Akademie. By the time of Fasch's death on 3 August 1800 the Akademie had about 100 members, and had received many notable visitors keen to experience its unique sound, including Beethoven who came in June 1796. After Fasch's death, his pupil Carl Friedrich Zelter became leader of the Akademie, continuing Fasch's ambitions and objectives. In 1807 he began an orchestra to accompany the Akademie, and in 1808 he founded a men's choir ('Liedertafel'), which became a model for similar choirs flourishing in the early nineteenth century and dedicated to German national music. The members of the Akademie were originally drawn from the wealthy bourgeois of Berlin. From early days they also included members of some of Berlin's wealthiest Jewish families, including the Itzig family and descendants of Moses Mendelssohn. These families were to have a significant influence on the history of the Akademie. Moses Mendelssohn's son, Abraham joined the Akademie in 1793 and Itzig's granddaughter, Lea Salomon, in 1796. They were later to marry and their children Felix and Fanny were leading members of the Akademie in the 1820s. Library Itzig's daughter (and hence Felix's great-aunt) Sarah Levy (1761-1854), a fine keyboard player who had been taught by Wilhelm Friedemann Bach, played concerti by Bach and others in many Akademie concerts and at Zelter's \\"Ripienschule\\" in the period 1806-1815. Her large collection of manuscripts of music of the Bach family, together with many others acquired by Abraham Mendelssohn from the widow of C. P. E. Bach, were left to the Akademie. Zelter also had a fine collection of Bach and Bach family manuscripts which he gave to the Akademie. By these means it acquired one of the finest collections of Bachiana in the world. The collection was looted by the Red Army in 1945 and hidden in the Kyiv Conservatory, but was returned to Germany after its rediscovery in 2000.Michael O'Loghlin. \\"Frederick the Great and his Musicians: The Viola da Gamba Music of the Berlin School\\", University of Queensland, Australia, 2008. , p. 60Patricia Kennedy Grimsted. \\"Bach is Back in Berlin: The Return of the Sing-Akademie Archive from Ukraine in the Context of Displaced Cultural Treasures and Restitution Politics\\", Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute, 2003. pp. 24-26 (See link for the story). Today, the collection is temporarily housed in the music section of the Berlin State Library. Later history Program book for the concert held in Milan, accompanied by Berlin Philharmonic, 1913 The success of the Akademie encouraged the founding of a new and permanent home. This was established in 1827 in Unter den Linden and became a major Berlin concert hall, at which many famous musicians were to give concerts, including Paganini, Schumann, and Brahms. On 11 March 1829, the 20-year-old Felix Mendelssohn, who was himself a pupil of Zelter, conducted here his famous revival of Bach's St Matthew Passion, a major milestone in re-establishing its composer's reputation as a founding father of European musical traditions. In 1832 on the death of Zelter, Mendelssohn had some hopes of succeeding him, but in the event the post went to the older, mediocre, but 'safe pair of hands' of Carl Friedrich Rungenhagen (1778‚Äì1851). Subsequent directors of the Akademie were: *August Eduard Grell (1853‚Äì76) *Martin Traugott Blumner (1876‚Äì1900) *Georg Schumann (1900‚Äì50) *Mathieu Lange (1950‚Äì73) *Hans Hilsdorf (1973‚Äì99) *Joshard Daus (2002‚Äì06) *Kai-Uwe Jirka (2006‚Äìpresent) After the separation between East and West Berlin, the Berliner Singakademie was founded in 1963 in East Berlin. This other Berliner Singakademie is a leading oratory choir in the united Berlin today. References=Bibliography *Die Sing-Akademie zu Berlin und ihre Direktoren. ed.

History  The club was formed in 1978 out of the merger of the football sides of Sport Vereinigung Arminia G√ºtersloh and Deutsche Jugendkraft G√ºtersloh in the hopes that the new club would be more successful than its un-storied predecessors. The union was a bit of a surprise because of some ill-will that had existed between the clubs going back to Arminia's refusal to share their stadium facility with DJK, and so make it possible for them to play in the Regionalliga in the late 1960s.Gr√ºne, Hardy (2001). Enzyklop√§die des deutschen Ligafu√üballs 7. Vereinslexikon. Kassel: Agon-Sportverlag. . Both sides had bounced back and forth between the second and third division through the late 1960s and into the 1970s. After their merger they settled down as a mid-table Amateur Oberliga Westfalen (III) club, with a couple of poor seasons leading to relegation to Verbandsliga Westfalen (IV), but always followed by immediate promotion. The club managed to play their way into the 2. Bundesliga in 1996, on the strength of a Regionalliga West/S√ºdwest title, for a three-year stay, but in 1999 were crushed by their 7 million DM debt. The club was dissolved by a court and all its results for the season annulled. The club was re-organized in 2000 and took up play in the Oberliga Westfalen (IV). In January 2010, it was announced that plans were in the works for a merger with SC Wiedenbr√ºck 2000, but the proposal failed.SCW 2000 und FCG 2000 starten Fusionsgespr√§che On 27 October 2013, the G√ºtersloh side suffered a record defeat losing 5:8 to SpVgg Erkenschwick: the 13 goals scored matched the total of a 1985‚Äì86 match that saw DJK Hellweg L√ºtgendortmund down Sportfreunde Siegen 7:6. In 2014, the club was overshadowed by rumours of around its precarious financial situation and the prospect voluntary withdrawal from play. New merger talks took place with SC Wiedenbruck and SC Verl, but these ended when the club avoided bankruptcy in October 2014 under new management. Since 2012 the club played in the tier five Oberliga Westfalen. After repeated financial troubles, the club filed for insolvency in January 2017,FCG-Insolvenz steht unmittelbar bevor and despite all efforts to secure funding through donations and sponsorship, announced the dissolution and liquidation of assets by the end of May 2017. Surprisingly, new sponsors were presented on 26 May, which pledged to finance operations for the next three years. The insolvency filing is to be cancelled.  Rivalries  FC G√ºtersloh followers share a heartfelt rivalry with nearby SC Verl whose supporters tease the \\"big city club\\" over its inconsistent performance and financial woes.

It is a trivial disease of worldwide occurrence that is believed to be caused by the genus Corynebacteria. The condition has been called extensively trichomycosis axillaris in the literature, but because it is a bacterial infection and not a fungal infection, it should be called trichobacteriosis. Presentation It is characterized by the presence of concretions along the hair shafts, clinically observed as yellow, and rarely as red or black nodules. These concretions derive from bacterial colonization along the hair shaft containing dried apocrine sweat with a cementing substance generated by the bacteria. Cause It is caused by several species of Corynebacterium. Obesity, hyperhidrosis, poor local hygiene, and warm, moist environments are common predisposing factors. Diagnosis The infection is diagnosed by close examination of the hair shafts where brown to yellow material called concretions are seen. There is usually an associated rancid odour. A microscopic examination can confirm the diagnosis, but this is rarely needed. Some patients with excessive sweating present the so-called corynebacterial triad, that is, the simultaneous presence of trichobacteriosis axillaris, erythrasma, and pitted keratolysis. Treatment No specific therapeutic studies on trichobacteriosis are available. Many authors consider that the most effective treatment consist in shaving of the affected area for a period of 2-3 weeks. The use of a concomitant treatment, such as sulfur soaps or benzoyl peroxideSwart MN, Weinberg AN. Bacterial diseases with cutaneous involvement. In: Fitzpatrick‚Äôs Dermatology in General Medicine, 6th edn. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2003: 1843‚Äì1878. is also recommended. Rubbing whilst washing may help to disrupt the biofilm, hence increasing the accessibility of antiseptics to the bacteria. Patients who shave the affected area only once will generally experience a recurrence of the infection, since, the bacteria begin to develop the concretions once again as the hair grows back. Corynebacterium infections are related to excessive sweating; for this reason, deodorants containing an aluminum chloride solution may be used for treatment and prevention. Maintaining good local hygiene is recommended.

The first prototype was made in 1960. The M-408, the first of the series, replaced the second generation Moskvitch 407 as the main production model; it had a longer wheelbase than the 407. Design work started in 1959, and the first prototype appeared in March 1961. The first production 408 was built 1 August 1964, and the 408 was given its official debut on October 21. First marketed body styles of the main version were a four-door saloon (base), five-door estate (the model M-426, an upgrade of second generation M-423 and M-424), and a three-door sedan delivery (the M-433, an upgrade of the second generation M-432 delivery pick-up). The IZh-408 was a duplicate version of the car made by IZh factory in Izhevsk from 1966 to 1967. It was then replaced in production by the M-412. In 1976, alongside the M-412, the series were succeeded by the third generation M-2140 series. Production series There were two distinct series of the M-408, which both used the same name. On 20 August 1966, Moskvitch produced its 100,000th M-408.Thompson, p. 139. The first series of cars were produced between 1964 and 1969 in Moscow. These automobiles had vertical rear lights, two or four round headlights, a front bench seat, and a 4-speed manual transmission with column mounted gear lever. The length of the standard model was . The second series was produced between 1969 and 1976. It had the same engine and transmission as its predecessor, but an updated body fitted with rectangular headlights and horizontal rear lights, with triangular turn signal markers mounted on tailfins. Also it had separated bucket seats and the transmission used a floor-mounted gear lever. Between 1966 and 1967, the car was also produced by the IZh military factory in the city of Izhevsk, carrying the IZh- Moskvitch-408 name ‚Äî though usually called simply \\"IZh\\". This car was a rebadged version of the MZMA Moskvitch-408. It was replaced in production with the IZh-412, a copy of the M-412, starting in 1967 and up to 1976. Moskvitch-408 second series Development The M-433 debuted in mid- December 1966, early models having a dividing bulkhead with a small behind the driver; later, the height was reduced so the driver could reach the cargo box.Thompson, p. 140. The rear door was split in two halves, top and bottom, while the solid sides were corrugated,Thompson, pp. 144-145. rather than smooth as was typical in Western deliveries. The M-426 appeared in March 1967; like the delivery version, it had stiffer rear springs. In 1967, the M-408 models were facelifted with a different grille and logo design, also featured on the co-produced Moskvitch 412 model. Both cars shared similar exterior design, with a slightly modified interior and new engine for the M-412. In 1969, after a complete revamp of the body design occurred, the company introduced new taillights, tailfins and somewhat thicker interior dashboards. Later on, a more advanced car built on the same platform would be known as the M-2138/40. Moskvitch designed a prototype fastback convertible in March 1964, the M-408 Tourist, with aluminum body panels and vertical taillights. Only two were built.Thompson, p. 141. Appearance and interior The car had modern features for 1964: squared-off body with flat roof panel and sharp tailfins, panoramic rear window and semi-panoramic windshield. Deluxe versions had then- fashionable quad headlights and (some series) two-tone paint. Since the layout of the first prototypes was created on the basis of the preceding M-407, the rear end design of the pre-facelift models inherited such characteristic features of the previous Moskvitch series as tailfins decorated with chrome trims, narrow taillights, a recognisable trunk handle, and a fuel tank flap in the middle, behind the number plate. The interior featured a stylish trapezoidal instrument cluster, column-mounted gear shift lever (until 1973), effective heater and had a then-common practical artificial leather (vinyl) upholstery (colour-coded). Technical details The M-408 was a conventional rear-wheel drive economy car powered by a 1357 cc OHV straight-four, producing at 4750 rpm (60.5 SAE hp). After 1967, the assembly of the engines was done by UZAM in Ufa. One two-barrel down-draft carburettor was used. Export versions had a slight increase in power, up to 54 hp(40 KW) , slightly reduced emisissions and slightly higher top speed. The car was initially equipped with self-adjusting manual drum brakes, then from 1969 with power brakes with a hydrovacuum servo and a split circuit braking system. This Moskvitch was the first Soviet-built car to have deliberate safety equipment (since 1969): crumple zones, a safer steering column, a soft grip steering wheel cover, soft interior parts, seat belts, a padded dashboard, and a split circuit braking system. Sales The car sold well in both the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries and was sold for export. In the USSR, the M-408/412 was the second best selling Moskvitch for the whole 1970s decade, bested only by its successor, the M-2140. In order to make it more competitive, the car was often upgraded during the time of its production and equipped with better gearboxes, more powerful 75 h.p. motors, hydrovacuum brake boosters, etc. Export models (408E) had quadruple headlights. The car was sold in France as the Moskvitch 1300, as the Moskvitsh Elite (408)/Elite De Luxe (408E)/Elite 1300 in Finland and as the Moskvich Carat in Norway. It was powered, since 1966 by straight four petrol engine, producing . It had a top speed of , which was faster than the contemporary Volga. \\"More worth than its price\\", was its slogan for export sales. It proved a good value in Britain, Finland, and Norway, for instance, and in 1968, 55% of production was for export.Thompson, p. 144. It was also assembled by Scaldia-Volga SA in Brussels, Belgium. In Belgium the car was sold as the Scaldia 1300/1400, although Scaldia also installed Perkins' 1.8-litre 4.108 engine in the Scaldia Diesel beginning in 1968. This model offered SAE,or 55 PS DIN, but lacked the twin headlamps of the petrol-engined export 408.Automobil Revue '70, p. 413. The 1.6-litre Perkins 4.99 was mounted between 1965 and early 1966,when it was replaced by the 1.8-liter version. Differences with M-412/Izh-412/Comby The M-408 and the M-412 were produced at the same time until December 1975, when the older model was taken out of production. The M-412 was a more upmarket version, powered by a 1500 cc, OHC slant-four engine. Introduced in 1967, the original Moskvitch 412 of 1967‚Äì1969 had a chassis and styling identical to that of the M-408 of 1964, both with two or four round headlights. . The 1969‚Äì1976 M-408 and the M-412 also had identical bodies, and the M-412 received the same changes as the M-408 did in 1969. Again, the only differences between them were the engines (1300 and 1500 cc respectively). This can make identification difficult since there are no external differences between the two cars. Usually, first series' M-412 had a \\"412\\" or \\"1500\\" badge at the rear, opposite of the Moskvich logotype or near the logo, depending on The version. Other had an 1500 or 412 sign on the front fenders near the doors or directly on the front grill. The 412 has sometimes mistakenly been referred to as the 408-1500, however such a name never existed. Another difference was that the M-412's speedometer read up to 160 km/h while that of the 408 only reached 140 km/h. The gear lever of The first series of 412 was a column mounted type, because first M-412 series had a front bench and used the same gearbox as 408. Since late 1968, the lever was floor mounted because a newer gearbox was used to improve performances and make a better use of the new engine and bucket seats were adopted. By comparison, IZH 412 had the floor mounted gearbox and bucket seats from the very beginning of their series. While in operation, the most notable difference between 408 and 412 is the sound of the engine, 412 being more silent and smooth than 408. Also, The exhaust pipe of 412 was slightly larger in diameter. First M-412 series, between 1967 and 1969 are a rare sight today, because they were manufactured in lower counts than M-408, and it was more expensive and barely exported as the UFA motor plant could not supply enough 412 engines. Moskvitch 408 had an oil bath air cleaner until the end of The series, even when this engine was passed to the 2138/2140 series. Moskvitch 412 had a dry type air cleaner, although first series, until late 1968 also had an oil bath air cleaner. Also, in 1967 the \\"IZh-Moskvitch-412\\" came into production. For 1967, this car was a twin of the Moskvitch-412, built (like the IZh-Moskvitch-408 corresponding model) by the IZh military factory in Izhevsk. The Izh-412 were produced there between 1967 and 1976. Starting in 1971, a spin-off series called \\"Izh Comby\\" was developed in Izhevsk and independently exported to Moscow and the rest of the USSR. It featured a 5-door hatchback and a windowed 3-door \\"trip car\\" (based on the panel van) that were not included in the original lineup. Izh did not manufacture four headlights version, but kept The same styling from 1964.

She belonged to the 1930s generation of analytic philosophy, and was a founder in 1933 of the journal Analysis. and was the first woman to hold a philosophy chair in the United Kingdom, as well as the first female President of Humanists UK. Biography Born in North Finchley, Middlesex, Susan Stebbing (as she preferred to be called), was the youngest of six children born to Alfred Charles Stebbing and Elizabeth (n√©e Elstob), and was orphaned at an early age. Stebbing was educated at James Allen's Girls' School, Dulwich, until she went, in 1904, to Girton College, Cambridge, to read history (though Cambridge did not award degrees or full University membership to women at the time). Having come across F. H. Bradley's Appearance and Reality she became interested in philosophy and stayed on to take part I of the Moral Sciences tripos in 1908. This was followed by a University of London M.A. in philosophy in 1912 that was awarded with distinction. Her thesis for the same, Pragmatism and French Voluntarism, subsequently being published in the Girton College Studies series.Willow, M.G. (1995) \\"L. Susan Stebbing (1885‚Äì1943)\\". In: Waithe M.E. (eds) A History of Women Philosophers, A History of Women Philosophers, vol 4. Springer, Dordrecht From 1911 to 1924 she held a number of teaching appointments. She was lecturer in philosophy at King's College, London, from 1913 to 1915, when she became part-time lecturer in philosophy at Bedford College, London; this was made a full-time position in 1920 and in 1924 she was appointed as a Reader there. She also held visiting lectureships at Westfield College, London (1912‚Äì20), Girton College, Cambridge (1911‚Äì14), and Homerton College, Cambridge (1911‚Äì14). From 1915 until her death she was principal of the Kingsley Lodge School for Girls, Hampstead. In 1927 the London University title of reader in philosophy was conferred upon her and held in conjunction with her position at Bedford College. She gained a DLitt in 1931. Stebbing was promoted to professor in 1933, thus becoming the first woman to hold a philosophy chair in the United Kingdom, an event that was, as Siobhan Chapman notes, \\"headline news\\". She was also a visiting professor at Columbia University from 1931 to 1932. She was president of the Mind Association from 1931 to 1932 and the Aristotelian Society from 1933 to 1934. Stebbing was a pupil of William Ernest Johnson; according to John Wisdom she was most influenced by G. E. Moore, and was a point of contact with the Vienna Circle, first inviting Rudolf Carnap to talk in the UK. Stebbing died, following the return of a cancer, on 11 September 1943 at Mount Vernon Hospital, in Northwood, Middlesex.  Legacy  Following her early death, a group of scholars, including C. D. Broad, G. E. Moore, Helen Wodehouse and Dorothy Tarrant. set up the L. S. Stebbing Memorial Fund to endow a scholarship for graduate study in philosophy.\\"L. S. STEBBING MEMORIAL FUND\\" Mind: (OUP), Vol. 53, No. 211 (July 1944), p287 https://doi.org/10.1093/mind/LIII.211.287 The Susan Stebbing Studentship now offers a stipend each year to a female graduate student in Philosophy at King's College London, which also now has a chair of philosophy named in her honour. A posthumous Festschrift titled Philosophical Studies. Essays in Memory of L. Susan Stebbing, was published in 1948 on behalf of the Aristotelian Society. It included an appreciation by John Wisdom and a full bibliography of Stebbing's writings. And essay contributions from, amongst others, H.B. Acton, Beatrice Edgell, A.C. Ewing, Ruth L. Saw. and (her best known student) Max Black. In a 1949 review of that work for Nature, physicist F. I. G. Rawlins noted that in \\"a life not free from controversy\\": > \\"Prof. Stebbing assuredly selected her targets with a refined academic glee, > as, for example, in her Philosophy and the Physicists (1937). The thrusts > she delivered seem somewhat on the harsh side; maybe they were not intended > to endure. Her whole being brings into relief the difference between logic > bent upon truth, and aesthetics bent upon beauty. In her greatness, she > lived for the former, others perhaps for the latter. But one day a 'pontiff' > will arise and throw a bridge across the narrows; when that happens, the > sheer weight of her thought will help to anchor it well and truly on her > territory.\\" Stebbing's philosophical significance has been more recently recognised by, and explored within, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, which commissioned, and in 2017 published, a publicly accessible online entry on her life and work by Michael Beaney and Siobhan Chapman. The first book-length study of Stebbing's life and thought was published by Chapman in 2013. Thinking to Some Purpose Stebbing's most popular work is Thinking to Some Purpose (1939), a book commissioned by Pelican Books and described on the cover as: \\"A manual of first-aid to clear thinking, showing how to detect illogicalities in other people's mental processes and how to avoid them in our own.\\"see \\"Penguin books through the ages\\". 21 July 2010. ISSN 0307-1235. (Retrieved 12 October 2019). which features a reproduction of the cover and notes that \\"Many Pelican books had an informative sub-title explaining what the book would cover.\\" The 'manual of first-aid to clear thinking' subtitle would also feature on the cover of reprints such as those of 1952 and 1959. One of the more quoted passages of the bookThe lines are quoted in the Preface of Vices of the Mind (2018) by Quassim Cassam, They also appear in a 2017 APA blog interview with him and in a 2018 Irish Times interview with Michael Beaney (who co-authored Stebbing's SEP entry) and in a 2018 piece about Stebbing for Homerton College by philosopher of education David Bridges. They can also be found at the page for Thinking To Some Purpose at Goodreads amongst other places. did not in fact appear in the main body of the work but on the first inside of the dust jacket of the 1939 printing and in the front matter of subsequent printings prior to 1952.An image of the passage in question, as it appeared in the 1941 printing can be found here. The 1952 printing, which did not carry these lines, can be inspected online at Internet Archive. As it appeared in print (in both 1939 and 1941) it runs, in full, as follows: > ‚ÄúThere is an urgent need to-day,\\" writes Professor Stebbing, \\"for the > citizens of a democracy to think well. It is not enough to have freedom of > the Press and parliamentary institutions. Our difficulties are due partly to > our own stupidity, partly to the exploitation of that stupidity, and partly > to our own prejudices and personal desires.‚Äù The work arose out of a synopsis she wrote for a series of radio broadcasts intended for the BBC. Published on the eve of the Second World War, Stebbing wrote in the Preface: > \\"I am convinced of the urgent need for a democratic people to think clearly > without the distortions due to unconscious bias and unrecognized ignorance. > Our failures in thinking are in part due to faults which we could to some > extent overcome were we to see clearly how these faults arise.\\" p.9 [1952] Chapter IV opens thus: > \\"Some forms of ineffective thinking are due to our not unnatural desire to > have confident beliefs about complicated matters with regard to which we > must take some action or other. We are sometimes too lazy, usually too busy, > and often too ignorant to think out what is involved in the statements we so > readily accept. ...we easily fall into the habit of accepting compressed > statements which save us from the trouble of thinking.

It currently has 40 communities and congregations around the state of Israel, 13 of which are new congregations, referred to as \\"U'faratztah\\" communities, and two kibbutzim, Yahel and Lotan. History Some of the earliest Reform rabbis to settle in what would become Israel included Rabbi Judah Leon Magnes, who was the first Chancellor of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and in 1938, became its President. Rabbi Meir Elk, who graduated from the liberal Breslau Rabbinical Seminary in Germany (now in Wroclaw, Poland), founded the Leo Baeck School in Haifa. The first Reform congregation in Israel opened in Jerusalem in 1958, and it was named Congregation \\"Har'el\\". A conference open to the public who wished to see a Jewish alternative to the Orthodox Movement took place in 1965. This strengthened the relationship between the six existing congregations, and served as the cornerstone for the establishment of the Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism (IMPJ). The IMPJ officially became an organization in Israel in 1971. The Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, the rabbinical college of Reform Judaism, began its Rabbinical Studies program in Israel in 1974, and in 1980, the first Reform rabbi was ordained by the HUC. The headquarters of the World Union for Progressive Judaism was moved to Jerusalem in 1973. Today, there are 40 communities and congregations affiliated with Reform Judaism in Israel. The IMPJ runs about 40 kindergartens, school-run educational programming; \\"Noar Telem\\", the Reform Movement youth organization, a part of Netzer Olami; and the Youth Adult and Students Forum for 20- to 30-year-olds, as well as four Batei Midrash, Jewish study centers. The first Reform kibbutz, Yahel, was founded in 1976 in Arava, and Lotan was founded in 1983. Har Halutz was established in Galilee in 1985. The movement has not attracted a significant following among religious Jews in Israel. Researchers attribute this to several factors: * the political clout of Orthodox Judaism in Israel, which controls the religious establishment and is hostile towards other denominations; * the Eastern European or the Middle Eastern origin of most Israelis, populations which are neither strictly religious nor oriented toward religious reform * the perceived lack of need, in a Jewish-majority state, for Orthodox-alternative organizations.Asher Cohen, ◊ó◊ï◊ú◊©◊™ ◊î◊™◊†◊ï◊¢◊î ◊ú◊ô◊î◊ì◊ï◊™ ◊û◊™◊ß◊ì◊û◊™ ◊ë◊ô◊©◊®◊ê◊ú, in: Avinoam Rosenak (editor), ◊î◊ô◊î◊ì◊ï◊™ ◊î◊®◊§◊ï◊®◊û◊ô◊™ : ◊î◊í◊ï◊™, ◊™◊®◊ë◊ï◊™ ◊ï◊ó◊ë◊®◊î, Van Leer Jerusalem Institute Press (2014). . pp. 420-439. The Movement participates in various initiatives for social justice, such as Rabbis for Human Rights, and it is affiliated with the World Union for Progressive Judaism. In 2012, The Israel Movement for Progressive Judaism officially changed its name to the \\"Israel Movement for Reform and Progressive Judaism\\". Reuven Marko serves as the Chairman of the IMPJ, and Rabbi Gilad Kariv serves as the Executive Director. In June and July 2015 the Reform movement in Israel came under attack by the new minister of religious affairs, David Azulai. The context was the Women of the Wall, an Israeli group fighting for the right of Jewish women to pray at the Kotel in a fashion incompatible with conservative Western Wall religious norms. In a meeting with MK Ayelet Shaked about that group, Azulai referred to them as \\"provocateurs\\" and claimed that Reform Judaism is ‚Äúa disaster for the nation of Israel.‚Äù Azulai's comments were condemned by Rabbi Gilad Kariv, executive director of the Reform movement in Israel, who noted, ‚ÄúIf Minister Azoulay cannot function as minister for all the citizens of Israel, then he should resign.‚Äù[\\"After offensive remark, Reform Jews demand ouster of Israel's new religious affairs minister\\"] Haaretz, 17 June 2015 In 2016 MK Yariv Levin criticized efforts to accommodate multi-denominational Judaism in Israel. At a government hearing on non-Orthodox prayer space at the Western Wall, Levin slammed Reform Judaism, saying egalitarian prayer space at the Wall is unnecessary based on his opinion that Reform Jews will \\"be all but gone in three generations.\\"Israeli Tourism Minister Blasts U.S. Reform Jews, Says Chelsea Clinton's Wedding Shows Extent of Assimilation Haaretz, Jan 31, 2013 Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned Levin‚Äôs remarks and the Reform movement in the U.S. (the largest Jewish religious organization there) decided to shun him. Kariv called on his American partners to refuse access to Levin. Rabbi Richard Jacobs, president of the American Union for Reform Judaism, agreed to cancel all meetings between Levin and Reform leaders. Jacobs told Israeli Army Radio: \\"There‚Äôs no reason to give him a platform in Jewish communities and organizations in the United States.

The Reform Movement‚Äôs Israel Religious Action Center sued the state on behalf of the Reform and Conservative/Masorti movements to allow members to use publicly funded mikvehs. The case, which took ten years to resolve, resulted in the Israeli Supreme Court ruling that public ritual baths must accept all prospective converts to Judaism, including converts to Reform as well as Conservative Judaism. In his 2016 ruling, Supreme Court Justice Elyakim Rubinstein said barring certain converts amounts to discrimination. Until this ruling Orthodox officials barred non-Orthodox converts from using any mikveh, claiming their traditions do not conform to Jewish law and the people they convert are therefore not Jews. Rubinstein noted: \\"Once it established public mikvahs and put them at the service of the public ‚Äî including for the process of conversion ‚Äî the State cannot but be evenhanded in allowing their use,\\" Rubinstein said. \\"The State of Israel is free to supervise the use of its mikvahs, so long as it does so in an egalitarian manner.\\"Israel‚Äôs Supreme Court: Public ritual baths must accept non-Orthodox, too Religion news, Feb 14, 2016 Achievements of Reform rabbis * Kehillat Yozma, a Reform synagogue in Modi'in, is the first non-Orthodox congregation in Israel to receive state funding for its synagogue building.http://templesinaidc.org/Events/index.cfm?id=5822&pge;_prg_id=8406&pge;_id=0&date;=10/21/2009 * Kinneret Shiryon, a Reform rabbi, is the first female rabbi in Israel. * Alona Lisitsa, a Reform rabbi, is the first female rabbi in Israel to join a religious council, joining Mevaseret Zion‚Äôs in 2012.

It claims to represent a total of some 1.8 million people, both registered constituents and non-member identifiers. The WUPJ states that it aims to create common ground between its constituents and to promote Progressive Judaism in places where individuals and groups are seeking authentic, yet modern ways of expressing themselves as Jews. It seeks to preserve Jewish integrity wherever Jews live, to encourage integration without assimilation, to deal with modernity while preserving the Jewish experience and to strive for equal rights and social justice. The WUPJ was established in London in 1926 as the Union of all Progressive (also Liberal or Reform) movements. It moved its headquarters to New York in 1959 and to Jerusalem in 1973. In 1990, the Reconstructionists ‚Äì who espouse a philosophy different from that of the former ‚Äì joined the WUPJ under an observer status, being the first and only non-Reform member.American Jewish Committee, American Jewish Year Book, 1992, University of Nebraska Press, 1992. p. 257.

Regional affiliates=North America The URJ is by far the largest member organization of the WUPJ, with a solid constituency of over 750,000 Jewish members (along with further 90,000 unconverted gentile spouses) and over a million non-members who identify with it in the U.S., and further 30,000 constituents in Canada. As of 2016, 1.5 million of the 1.9 million members of WUPJ are in the U.S. German immigrants and rabbis brought Reform to America, although a short-lived congregation that espoused a somewhat similar ideal existed in Charleston between 1824 and 1833. The Union of American Hebrew Congregations, URJ since 2003, was founded in 1873. North America is also home to the Jewish Reconstructionist Federation, which has affiliates, 97 only Five of them outside the continent (in Delft, Netherlands Cura√ßao Weisbaden, Germany Serrastretta, Italy Moscow, Russia). The JRF joined as an observer in 1990. It is the only non-Reform organization in the WUPJ, the other members of which do uphold the basic tenets of ongoing revelation, personal God and the like. In 2013, it had some 65,000 constituents. United Kingdom Claude Montefiore, a major theologian, named his religious ideology \\"Liberal Judaism\\", founding the Jewish Religious Union as a platform in 1902. His movement was a founding member of the WUPJ in 1926. British Reform, established officially in 1942, joined the global organization in 1945. Israel A first congregation was formed at Jerusalem during 1958. The movement was incorporated in 1971. The Israeli surrounding encouraged a more conservative approach on behalf of the local branch. The prayer in vernacular, for example, was Hebrew anyway, and the populace was relatively more familiar with rabbinic sources. Patrilineal descent is not recognized by the IMPJ, as by many other smaller affiliates, which cannot antagonize the Israeli Orthodox religious establishment. South Africa The movement was established in 1931 with the encouragement of Abraham Zevi Idelsohn and Lily Montagu. South African Jewry is mostly nominally Orthodox, with those in Progressive streams accounting for around 10% of South African Jews currently residing in the country. Australia, New Zealand and Asia The movement was established in the 1930s in Melbourne by Ada Phillips with the encouragement of Lily Montagu and Israel Mattuck. Australian Jewry is similar to its South African counterpart in that it is mostly nominally Orthodox. Around twenty percent of affiliated Jews in Australia belong to progressive congregations. Continental Europe Reform Judaism began in Germany, led by Rabbi Abraham Geiger. It stagnated considerably after the 1840s. In 1898, German Liberal rabbis organized the Union of Liberal Rabbis in Germany under Heinemann Vogelstein. In 1908 the laity formed the Union for Liberal Judaism in Germany. At its height, it had some 10,000 members and half the rabbis in the country. The ULJ was a founding member of the World Union in 1926. After the destruction of the Holocaust, Germany's Jews, mostly refugees of foreign descent, largely favoured Orthodoxy. Liberal Judaism managed to gain inroads slowly, and first prayer groups appeared in 1995. The Union of Progressive Jews was founded in 1997. The first new branch established by the WUPJ was in the Netherlands, in 1931, eventually coalescing into the Nederlands Verbond voor Progressief Jodendom. The movement is growing in Spain. As of 2016 there are six congregations, while there was only one congregation a decade ago. In 2017 the Reform community there expects to have its first native-born rabbi since the Expulsion in 1492 once he completes his rabbinical training in London.It‚Äôs different out there for Reform Jews Jewish Weekly, February 18, 2016 Latin America Since the early 2000s, a Latin American affiliate has been evolving. Officially founded at the Leaders Regional Conference of Progressive Communities in C√≥rdoba (Argentina), in December 2009, then WUPJ- Latin America renamed itself the Union for Reform Judaism - Latin America (UJR-AmLat, the acronym in Spanish and Portuguese) in 2019. The main concern of the time in the early 2000s was the vulnerability of the Jewish communities of Argentina, which was going through a serious social, economic and political crisis. The embryo of the organization was conceived in 2002 in S√£o Paulo, by activists from liberal communities of Brazil, who chose that city as the regional headquarters of the organization. As of June 2020, UJR-AmLat has 26 affiliated communities, being one Rabbinical Institute, one Jewish School (both in Buenos Aires), two youth movements (affiliated to Netzer Olami) in S√£o Paulo, and 22 synagogues in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, Peru, Costa Rica, and Guatemala.

He also wrote articles for various science fiction magazines, and was the Coordinator of the Doctor Who Appreciation Society. He most recently lived in London, where he taught mathematics. Hinton was found dead in his home on 3 December 2006. The cause of death was given as heart attack. Work Hinton first became known for his articles about various science fiction television programmes, including Doctor Who and Star Trek. These brought him to the attention of the editor of Marvel UK's Doctor Who Magazine, who offered him the role of reviewing merchandise for the magazine's Shelf Life section. It was whilst writing for the magazine that Hinton had his first novel published, The Crystal Bucephalus, as part of Virgin Publishing's Missing Adventures range. The book ‚Äî which Hinton often referred to as \\"The Crystal Bucket\\" ‚Äî was originally submitted for Virgin's New Adventures, and 50,000 words of this version were written before the change was made. This novel was followed by a further Missing Adventure, Millennial Rites in 1995, and then by Hinton's only New Adventure in 1996, GodEngine, which features the Ice Warriors as well as oblique appearances by the Daleks. Following Virgin's loss of their licence to produce Doctor Who merchandise, Hinton began submitting proposals to BBC Books and in 2001 they published his novel The Quantum Archangel as part of their Past Doctor Adventures range. This was followed in 2004 by the novel Synthespians‚Ñ¢, which again had started life as a proposal for the current incumbent Doctor before being altered to feature a previous Doctor. Synthespians‚Ñ¢ also came into difficulties when an image of the television show Dynasty was used on the cover: the cover's creators had arranged for permission to use the copyrighted image, but had neglected to arrange permission to alter it, and so at the last minute a replacement cover had to be produced. It is this that appears on the cover of the novel. Hinton's Doctor Who novels often contain references to or explanations of elements of past continuity. He was the originator of the term \\"fanwank\\", which he applied to his own work. Hinton also continued to work with Virgin, writing pseudonymously under the name Paul C. Alexander for their Idol range. He authored three books in the range: Chains of Deceit, The Final Restraint and Code of Submission. These titles were a major departure from his science fiction, and explored aspects of his sexuality that were only suggested in his other works. Hinton wrote for Big Finish Productions' audio adventures, with the play Excelis Decays being produced in 2002 for their Doctor Who range and The Lords of Forever in 2005 for their Tomorrow People range. Hinton also wrote short stories for a variety of their short fiction collections. Before his death, Hinton had proposed a Doctor Who novel to BBC Books dealing with the final adventure of the Sixth Doctor. His proposal was rejected, but Hinton continued to work on the manuscript. After his death, the novel, Time's Champion, was completed by Chris McKeon, and edited and published by David J. Howe using the facilities of Telos Publishing Ltd., as a benefit for the British Heart Foundation. In addition to this an anthology, Shelf Life (named after his review column), was edited and published by Jay Eales, David A. McIntee and Adrian Middleton, also for the benefit of the British Heart Foundation. Outside of the science fiction world Hinton was a noted IT journalist in the UK, editing magazines in the mid-1990s for VNU Business Publications in London and moving on to ITNetwork.com shortly afterwards.

The club is affiliated to the Berks & Bucks Football Association.FA Community Clubs BerksBucksFA They were established in 1908 and were founder members of the Chiltonian League in 1984. They are members of the . They are currently managed by Matt Stowell.  History  Holmer Green F.C. was founded in 1908 and started playing in the Chesham & District League. In 1934 the club switched to the Wycombe Combination League, as it was known then. In 1953 the club won its first major trophy ‚Äì the Berks & Bucks Junior Cup. The 1960s saw success again in the Berks & Bucks Junior Cup (1965) as well as three further victories in the Chesham Charity Cup. Under Norman King's managership the Wycombe League title was won in 1972 and 1974. In 1975 the club moved its headquarters to the new H.G.S.A. complex at Watchet Lane. This move coincided with victory in the Wycombe Senior Cup, and in 1977 with Roly Clarke as manager the team won the Berks & Bucks Intermediate Cup. This victory gained the club senior status and in 1981, with Pete Eyres as manager the Wycombe League and League Cup was won.History Holmer Green FC In 1984 Holmer Green were founder members of the new Chiltonian League, winning the Premier Division in 1984‚Äì85 and 1985‚Äì86. In 1991 with new manager Barry Hedley they finished third in the league, won the Wycombe Senior Cup and also reached the semi-finals of the Berks & Bucks Intermediate Cup. At the beginning of the 1993‚Äì94 season Barry Hedley returned north and Ian Sheill took over as manager, and assisted by Jez Hodges led the team to the Premier Division title. The Centenary Wycombe Senior Cup was also won for the second time in three years. The 1994‚Äì95 season, the club's last in the Chiltonian League, saw even more trophies in the cabinet: the team finished as runners-up in the league but finally managed to win the Bon Accord Trophy for the first time. At the end of the 1994‚Äì95 season the club tried to move up to the next league of the English football league system into the South Midlands League. They were denied permission to move by the Chiltonian League, so the club spent the summer of 1995 in various FA tribunals and appeals, eventually winning their case in mid August 1995, and being accepted into the Senior Division of the South Midlands League. In this season they won the Senior Division title and also reached the semi-finals of the Berks & Bucks Senior Trophy. In the 1996‚Äì97 season, Jez Hodges was installed as player-manager, and the club won the Senior Division Cup and claimed the runners-up spot in the league. This season also saw them play their very first FA Vase game, away to Carterton Town. They retained the Senior Division Cup in the following season and finished in fourth place in the league. With the merger of the Spartan and South Midlands Leagues in 1997‚Äì98 Holmer Green were placed in the Senior Division of the new Spartan South Midlands League, which they won on goal difference over Hanwell Town, getting promoted to the Premier Division. They also reached the final of the Berks & Bucks Senior Trophy for the first time, losing 1‚Äì0 to Eton Wick, and also reached the two-legged final of the League Challenge Trophy, losing 3‚Äì0 on aggregate to Waltham Abbey. Promotion to the Premier Division was achieved as the club had floodlights installed that season to enable them to play at that standard. In the 2000‚Äì01 season the club played its first ever FA Cup game, losing 6‚Äì1 against Uxbridge. In 2008 Holmer Green commemorated their centenary year with a friendly at Watchet Lane against Wycombe Wanderers in front of a record crowd in excess of 800 people. The following year, however, the club was relegated back to the first division, but in the 2009‚Äì10 bounced back as champions of the Spartan South Midlands League Division One and until 2017‚Äì18 season were still in the Premier Division. However at the close of the season and as part of a reorganisation managed by The FA, they were moved sideways into the UHL Hellenic League.

Its location in the 3rd nome of Lower Egypt, or \\"Estate of the Cattle\\", focus on the goddess Hathor, as well as faunal and textual evidence suggests it played a role in transporting cattle between regions. Whether or not it was a self-sufficient town or built solely to support the temple is currently unknown. The site's main findings include the Tomb of Khesuwer, a large necropolis, and a temple dedicated to Sekhmet-Hathor. Inscriptions designating Hathor as the \\"Mistress of Imu\\", among other similar inscriptions, and the location of Kom el-Hisn have given evidence to the site being the former nome capital Yamu, or Imu. Much of the information on this site from previous excavations is lost or remains unpublished. Excavation history Relief with Hathor and pharaoh Necho II, from Kom el-Hisn. Walters Art Museum The site was initially uncovered by Flinders Petrie during his excavation at Naukratis in 1881. It was then surveyed by Francis Llewellyn Griffith from 1885 to 1887. This survey captured the remains of a mudbrick temple, enclosure wall, and four statues of Ramesses II. Two of these statues had inscriptions dedicating them to Sekhmet-Hathor, \\"Mistress of Imu\\". The temple and enclosure wall have since been destroyed. Currently, two of the statues of Ramesses II are still at the site. One has been moved to the Cairo Museum. Another survey in 1902, this time by Georges Daressy, found more artifacts related to Ramesses II with \\"two broken colossi of Amenemhet III usurped by Ramsses II, an inscribed stone of Ramesside date, and four blocks from a chapel of Shoshenq II which had been usurped by Ramsses II\\". In 1910 the Tomb of Khesuwer, a priest of Hathor, was found and excavated by C. Edgar. Within, a stone head of a 12th Dynasty Pharaoh was found wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt. A damaged statue group of Amenemhat III was also found, possibly related to the broken colossi found earlier. This tomb cements the presence of a cult of Hathor at the site as well its possible religious function. In the early 1940s, mudbrick tombs were uncovered after a heavy rainfall. El-Amir, Farad, and Hamada excavated what turned out to be a large necropolis from 1943 to 1949. There was a count of over one thousand graves ranging from lower to upper class burials. The most common were simple sand- pit burials. Among these, blades were found in a portion of the tombs labeled the ‚Äúwarrior group‚Äù, but most burials contained no or little grave goods. The 1946 and 1948 excavations yielded a large number of \\"pot-burials\\" containing the remains of children. Among these, family tombs or mass graves were also found containing mostly children. They were identified the length of necklaces found with the remains. The exact number of graves is unknown. The majority date to the First Intermediate Period and Middle Kingdom. This excavation was not fully published and excluded a number of possible Roman graves. No maps or field notes from this excavation survive and much of what survives has remained unpublished. A study of fauna and flora remains from residential deposits was completed in 1988. Considering the Nile Delta's historical association with cattle production, the small amount of cattle bones found suggests the site still had some affiliation with cattle production and the overall Estate, but not including butchering or raising cattle. A majority of their food appears to come from pigs, with remains indicating consumption of pigs outnumbering that of sheep and goats. This number suggests the site was not heavily involved in grain production. Cow bones found on the north end of the site suggests an animal necropolis, giving further evidence to the relation between the presence of the Hathor cult and involvement in the cattle production of the Nile Delta. This has not been excavated. A series of excavations in 1984, 1986, and 1988 found remains of domestic architecture and materials, including an enclosure wall that had bordered much of the site. From these excavations came artifacts like bread molds and bowls that could be used for food storage, but the lack of basic items and the means to produce them suggests Kom el-Hisn was a religious settlement or ran under a governmental authority. During Robert J. Wenke's excavation in 1988, he uncovered broken sealings and ceramics dating to the 5th and 6th dynasties. The site appears to have been a settlement occupied at least to the Middle Kingdom. Though the lack of basic domestic goods gives evidence to Kom el-Hisn being occupied by the Hathor cult and a small support staff for those priests. This is again supported by Wenke's excavation in 1988, where stone tools were found but leftovers from their manufacture were rare. So far, no manufacturing workshops or evidence of such has been found, but Wenke stresses that it is still possible they existed but were removed from the main site. Tomb of Khesuwer One of the first major findings at the site was the 12th Dynasty limestone tomb of Khesuwer (\\"Khesu the Elder\\"). The remains were discovered on the south-west corner of Kom el-Hisn. It is the only tomb at the site containing inscriptions, which date to the Middle Kingdom. With these inscriptions and the basalt head found during the excavation, Edgar dates the tomb to the reign of Amenemhat III. Four foundation deposits were found beneath the remains of two mudbrick walls found surrounding the tomb. Each contained a limestone plaque with an inscription containing his name that matched the one found inside the tomb. By the time of the tomb's discovery, the coffin and offering left behind had turned to dust. These deposits were placed as part of a ritual during the temple's construction so finding them beneath his tomb suggests of re-use of parts of the temple to build Khesuwer's tomb. One scene depicts Khesuwer and four rows of priestesses, who are clapping and playing instruments, giving evidence to his title as \\"Overseer\\" of the priestess' of Hathor. It is assumed his office was that of the temple found at Kom el-Hisn. Yamu Yamu or Imu was a capital of the 3rd Nome of Lower Egypt. It is found in texts as early as the 5th Dynasty but the current location of the town is unknown. Due to the discovery of the inscription on the statues found at Kom el-Hisn, this site is thought to have been the location of Yamu. Unpublished notes from Petrie's visit to the site in 1884 describe an offering table to the goddess Sekhmet, with an inscription that reads \\"the king gives an offering [to] the mistress of Yamu, Sekhmet\\". He also reported other inscriptions detailing the \\"mistress of Yamu\\", but is not specific about where he found them or if they refer to Kom el-Hisn. Though it is a strong theory that Yamu and Kom el-Hisn are the same, there is no concrete evidence to prove this.

Formerly classed as members of the thrush family Turdidae, they are now considered to be Old World flycatchers (Muscicapidae) of the chat subfamily (Saxicolinae). The chats are a lineage of Old World flycatchers that has evolved convergently to thrushes. Taxonomy and systematics The word Luscinia was used for nightingales and similar birds in Classical Latin (e.g. in the AD 70s Naturalis Historia by Pliny the Elder), if not earlier. Etymologically, it might be derived from luscus (Latin for \\"half-blind\\", \\"half-understood\\" etc.) or clue≈ç (Latin for \\"to be well-known\\") + (probably) Latin can≈ç \\"to sing\\". Hence, it could be translated as \\"little-seen [as in the twilight] songster\\" or \\"famous songster\\".Lewis & Short (1879), Glare (1968-1982) The genus Luscinia was introduced by the English naturalist Thomas Forster in 1817. The type species is the common nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos). Delimitation of Luscinia versus the genus Erithacus had been confused for long; species were rather indiscriminately placed in one or the other genus, or Luscinia was entirely merged into Erithacus. The genus Luscinia previously included many more species. A large molecular phylogenetic study published in 2010 found that the genus did not represent a monophyletic group. Species were therefore reassigned to other genera leaving only three species remaining in the original genus. The same study showed that the white- bellied redstart, previously placed in the monotypic Hodgsonius, belonged to the same clade. The species currently placed in Luscinia are: * Bluethroat, Luscinia svecica * White-bellied redstart, Luscinia phaenicuroides (previously the only species in the genus Hodgsonius) * Thrush nightingale, Luscinia luscinia * Common nightingale or rufous nightingale, Luscinia megarhynchos Description Thrush nightingale, Luscinia luscinia Common nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) song The Luscinia species are stocky small birds, 13‚Äì16 cm long with an upright stance and a moderately short frequently cocked tail. They watch for insects, worms and other invertebrates from a low perch, and feed mostly on the ground, hopping, with frequent stops, on their strong legs. They are territorial during the breeding season, and most occur as far north as to be migratory.Grimmett et al. (1999), Svensson et al. (1999) In the two species named as nightingales, the sexes are similar. They are plain brown above, whitish below with light streaking, and have a rufous tail. In the other Luscinia species, the male is much brighter than the cryptic, usually brownish-grey female. Males have a dark blue, black or brown back, and red, orange or blue on the throat and upper breast. Several have white or rufous patches on the sides of the tail, giving a pattern recalling that of the closely related wheatear (Oenanthe), or some of the less closely related Muscicapinae (e.g. red-breasted flycatcher, Ficedula parva). The songs of this genus are often complex and musical, especially in the \\"typical\\" nightingales. They are birds of Eurasia, occurring from the subarctic to the tropical regions. They are plentiful in temperate regions, and many of the birds in this genus are strongly migratory, wintering in tropical Africa, India or Southeast Asia. The breeding habitat is typically scrub or forest, and their cup nest is usually constructed low in a bush. The birds can be difficult to see in dense undergrowth, especially if not singing, but they may frequent somewhat more open habitats in their winter quarters. Fossil record Fossil remains of a probable Luscinia resembling to the larger members of the genus have been found at Polg√°rdi in Hungary. They date from the Messinian age, around 12 to 7.3 million years ago (Ma) during the Late Miocene subepoch. A Late Pliocene fossil from Rƒôbielice Kr√≥lewskie (Poland), of Piacenzian age (around 3 Ma), could be an ancestral bluethroat. A supposed Sylvia warbler fossil from the late Gelasian of Bad Deutsch-Altenburg (Austria), about 2 Ma old, may be of a Luscinia instead; due to its recent age it probably belongs to a living species or its immediate ancestor.H√≠r et al.

It was released on 10 October 1988 through record label Beggars Banquet. The album's release came at the end of a relatively successful year for the group, which had also seen the release of an \\"accessible\\" album, The Frenz Experiment, and a handful of singles in the UK charts. However, there was internal strife within the band; Smith was increasingly dependent on alcohol and speed, and his marriage to Fall lead guitarist, songwriter and vocalist Brix Smith was coming to an end. Although she wrote many of the most acclaimed songs on the album, including \\"Overture From Kurious Oranj\\", \\"Van Plague?\\" and \\"Bad News Girl\\", she was excluded from the writing and publishing credits. I Am Kurious Oranj was intended as the soundtrack for the ballet I Am Curious, Orange, a collaboration with the dancer Michael Clark. The music was mostly pre-written by Brix Smith and bassist Steve Hanley. A live version was recorded during an Edinburgh Festival performance of the ballet, and issued in 2000 as I Am as Pure as Oranj.  Background  I Am Kurious Oranj was intended as the soundtrack for the ballet I Am Curious, Orange, produced by contemporary dance group Michael Clark & Company, and loosely based on the 300th anniversary of William of Orange's ascension to the English throne. The album combines studio recordings with tracks recorded live during performances in Edinburgh in August 1988. The opening track \\"New Big Prinz\\" (as well as its alternative version, \\"Big New Priest\\") is based on \\"Hip Priest\\" from the group's 1982 album Hex Enduction Hour; the original track was also used in the ballet as a backing tape. \\"Jerusalem\\" is an adaptation of William Blake's hymn using Hubert Parry's original music (although Parry does not appear in the credits). \\"Last Nacht\\" is a remix of \\"Bremen Nacht\\" from the group's previous album, The Frenz Experiment. \\"Dead Beat Descendant\\" was written for the ballet and performed live, but did not make the album. It was later re-recorded and released as a track on the Seminal Live compilation. I Am Kurious Oranj's title is derived from Swedish director Vilgot Sj√∂man's films I Am Curious (Yellow) (1967) and I Am Curious (Blue) (1968). It appears as I Am Kurious, Oranj on some packaging formats.  Critical reception  I Am Kurious Oranj was critically well received at the time. NME wrote \\"[The Fall have] retained the power to surprise, to provoke and occasionally outrage that only The Smiths could pretend to possess in the '80s.\\" A later review of the album by AllMusic, however, is more indifferent, opining, \\"As a cohesive Fall album it fails [...] I Am Kurious Oranj would have been more interesting to see than hear.\\"  Track listing  As with other Fall albums released through Beggars Banquet Records, I Am Kurious Oranj featured a different track listing across the various formats on which it was originally released. In addition to extra tracks \\"Guide Me Soft\\" and \\"Big New Priest\\", the UK CD featured several alternative and extended versions of songs (tracks 3, 5, 7, 8 and 12). In 2013, Beggars remastered and reissued the album on CD as a part of the 5 Albums box set; the new edition used the CD mixes sequenced according to the vinyl track order, with extra tracks and alternate vinyl mixes added as bonus tracks.

He resides in Finchley with his wife Jackie and daughter Hollie. Following a brief snooker career, Vaswani became a regular on the poker circuit, and due to his involvement in Late Night Poker, he also became one of the pioneers of poker on television. He is the first (and to date only) person to reach 4 European Poker Tour (EPT) final tables. The latest being at Monte Carlo 2007 (eliminated first, on the first hand) one of those final tables bought a win, the Dublin Season 2 (2004) event. He won his first World Series of Poker bracelet in 2007, in the $1,500 Limit Hold'em Shootout event. His other televised appearances include a win in the Poker Nations Cup, and runner-up in finishes in two more televised events. Snooker Vaswani grew up in Finchley, Greater London, where his first major game was snooker, where he lived a hustler lifestyle, regularly playing truant to play when he was 13 and 14. At the age of 18, he played professionally for two years before realising that although he was making a comfortable living through the game (he once managed to make three centuries in one match, and achieved a 147 break), he was spending more time gambling than practising, and he was unlikely to break through into the top players in the world. (Vaswani's younger brother Sunit did break through in the snooker world, finishing 2nd in the race for the 2001 English Amateur award. Vaswani has since acted as his manager.) Poker career=Early years Vaswani, of Indian origin, began playing cards from the age of 9, and at the age of 12, he organised a low- stakes poker game with friends on a trip to Wales. Their teacher stopped them playing, so they ended up playing for sweets instead. Vaswani has long considered seven-card stud to be the most skilful poker variant, and built up his early poker knowledge playing the ¬£100 game at the Victoria Casino on Edgware Road. Vaswani met Joe Beevers in Luton when placing bets on dog racing and they later set up a private poker game together. It was in one of these games that they met both Barny and Ross Boatman. Together, the four became known as The Hendon Mob and became regulars on the European poker tournament circuit. In the first published article on The Hendon Mob, journalist and poker expert Victoria Coren publicised Vaswani's nickname The Looks, referring to his claimed status as the best-looking of the group. Soon after, Vaswani began using the nickname Crazy Horse, sharing his nickname with the Lakota leader Tashunca-uitco. Vaswani and the rest of The Mob were invited by Nic Szeremeta to appear in the brand new Late Night Poker television series. Vaswani appeared in each of the show's 6 series, reaching the series 2 Grand Final and the series 4 and 5 Semi-finals. Vaswani's first major tournament win happened at the HFl 5,000 LIDO tournament at the Master Classics of Poker tournament in Amsterdam in 1999. At the time, this was Europe's most prestigious tournament, but he was broke and had to borrow money from Joe Beevers to stake in a cash game to build up money for the entry fee. The WSOP and beyond Vaswani first finished in the money of a World Series of Poker (WSOP) event in the 2001 $3,000 no limit Texas hold 'em event won by Erik Seidel. The next year, he had a 3rd-place finish in the $2,000 limit hold 'em event, and a 2nd-place finish in the $2,000¬Ω hold 'em ‚Äì 1/2 seven-card stud event. He made three final tables in the 2004, with his best finish being 3rd place in the $3,000 no limit hold 'em event. In 2007, Vaswani became the first member of the Mob to win a WSOP bracelet, winning $217,438 in the $1,500 limit hold 'em shootout event. The following year, he made the final table of the $10,000 World Championship Omaha Hi-Lo Split event, finishing 7th. His most recent WSOP cash was in the Main Event of the 2009 World Series of Poker Europe, where he finished 15th and earned ¬£40,481 ($66,738 at the time of the event). Vaswani has also made 4 final tables on the European Poker Tour (EPT). In the first season, he won the Dublin event and finished 2nd to Noah Boeken in the Copenhagen event. In the second season, he finished 5th in Deauville. He also made the final table of the Season 3 Main Event, where he finished 8th. His EPT final table tally is double the next best total, held several other players, including Marc Karam, Marcel L√ºske and Noah Boeken (The record belongs to Luca Pagano, who has made 6 finals tables). His other major tournament victories include: * ¬£500 pot limit seven-card stud, European Poker Classic 2000 * ‚Ç¨5,000 European Hold'em Championship, Euro Finals of Poker 2002 * ¬£500 pot limit seven-card stud, Poker Classics 2003 * ¬£500 no limit hold'em, Midland Masters 2003 * Poker Nations Cup 2006 Vaswani was also a quarter-finalist in the 2003 World Heads-Up Poker Championship, runner-up to Harry Demetriou in the 2004 Victor Chandler Poker Cup, and a finalist in the pot limit hold 'em Gaming Club World Poker Championship. He finished runner-up in the 2005 William Hill Poker Grand Prix, following a bad beat against eventual winner Phil Laak. However, commentator Lucy Rokach repeatedly laid claim to him being the best player in the 64-player field, that included former World Champion Scotty Nguyen and WSOP bracelet winners Donnacha O'Dea and Brian Wilson. (Simon Trumper has also referred to him as \\"the best tournament player in Europe, especially in No Limit.\\") As of 2009, his total live tournament winnings are exceed $3.2 million. His 15 cashes at the Las Vegas WSOP account for $846,229 of those winnings. Note that his cash at the 2009 WSOP Europe is listed in the table on this page, but is not included in his count of cashes or money earned.World Series of Poker Earnings , worldseriesofpoker.com Vaswani appeared in Late Night Poker Masters in late 2006 on Channel 4, in the same heat as season 6 champion Peter Costa and Willie Tann, but did not progress. Vaswani has written over 20 articles for The Hendon Mob's website, and a poker lesson for Matthew Hilger's site internettexasholdem.com. Vaswani regularly plays $100‚Äì$200 no limit hold 'em online, and is sponsored by Full Tilt Poker. He has also played $200‚Äì$400 pot limit Omaha on the site, where he has won pots in excess of $160,000. Other gambling Vaswani has been described as \\"an avid gambler who 'would bet on anything that moves'\\". This has led to him being known for having a fluctuating bankroll due to the variance in his sports betting hobby. Joe Beevers has indicated that Vaswani will often have $100,000 in his pocket one day; but it will be gone the next. Vaswani has indicated he is not too concerned about the outcome of bets he makes, so long as he has made the right decision in each case. Vaswani is also a keen golfer, and has had large financial upswings and downswings as a result of wagering on his game. Also, during the 888.com Poker Nations Cup, Vaswani made numerous large wagers with the Swedish team, and staked large amounts of money on Chinese poker, which he considers to be a game of pure luck.

The main characteristic of its design is its sensitivity. It is a popular and very effective method of bite indication both on still and running water. It is not used in game fishing (i.e. salmon, trout and sea trout) and is seldom, if ever, used when fishing for very large coarse fish (e.g. carp or pike). In essence, the angler watches the tip of the fishing rod to detect bites as opposed to, say, a float or an electronic bite alarm. Description The quiver tip is an extension of the fishing rod. The rod is specially designed to take quiver tips; nowadays, they are often called leger or feeder rods. Very sensitive float rods can be used for quiver tip fishing, but normally fishermen have a specialist rod especially for the task. The eyed tip of approximately 1‚Äì2 ft in length is attached as an extension to the end of the rod by a put-in or screw-in method. The quiver tip itself is a means of improving bite detection in conjunction with the ledgering method of fishing, whereby a weight is attached to the line close to the hook to assist in casting. A variation of this method is the swim feeder, which is a small weighted container with small holes in which loose feed can be placed to attract fish to the area near the hook bait.  Use  On still water fishing venues after casting, the rod should be placed in a rod rest at a 90 degree angle to the direction of the cast with the tip near to the water to reduce the effects of the wind vibration on the tip. On moving waters such as rivers the rod should be placed on a stand pointing towards the direction of the cast with the tip high in the air in order to reduce the impact of the water flow on the line. The line between the end of the tip and the weight/swim feeder should be tensioned so that a slight bend in the quiver tip exists. The reason for this is to allow for the detection of two types of bite. The first type of bite occurs when the fish takes the bait and moves away from the fisherman, causing the line to tighten and pull on the quiver tip. The second type of bite occurs when the fish takes the bait and moves towards the fisherman causing the line to slacken and the quiver tip to drop back/straighten. Types Quiver tips are, relative to the rods which hold them, inexpensive and found in all coarse fishing tackle shops. They can be bought in various test curves, which correspond to how stiff the tip is (often measured in ounces.) The lower the test curve, the less stiff the tip is (i.e. the less weight required to bend the tip.) The test curve of the tip should be carefully considered as it could drastically impact on the bite detection/playing of the fish and should relate to the type of fish targeted and weather conditions. As a general rule, it is desirable to fish with the lightest tip possible; that means the tip with the lightest test curve. This is because the lighter and more flexible the tip, the more sensitive and accurate the bite detection it provides. One of the basic skills in quiver tip fishing is selecting the correct weight of the tip to match the target fish, having regard to the type of water and the prevailing weather conditions. For example, if British roach are being targeted on a stillwater in flat calm conditions, a quiver tip of a test curve of no more than an ounce would be a good choice. Alternatively, fishing for a strong aggressive fish like the British barbel in a fast-flowing river would require a heavier tip, possibly of three ounces or more - a lighter tip would be permanently bent round by the flow of the water, eliminating bite detection, and playing a strong fish would probably break it completely.

It combines action and puzzle game elements. Players must navigate a series of screens to explore a landscape suspended in a dimensional space. Development was headed by Paul Shirley, who drew inspiration from Ultimate Play the Game games that feature an isometric projection. The game was successful in the United Kingdom and was well received by the video game press. Reviewers praised its visuals and design, but criticized its audio. Similarities were drawn to Marble Madness, which was released in arcades two years earlier. Spindizzy was followed by a 1990s sequel titled Spindizzy Worlds.  Gameplay  isometric stage. Game statistics (remaining time, collected jewels, and remaining stages) are tracked at the top. The ZX Spectrum version is pictured. Spindizzy is an action and puzzle game played from an isometric perspective. Players can view the playing field from four angles, and rotate between them. The game takes place in a fictional landscape of interconnected stages suspended in a dimensional space. The player controls a probe called a Gyroscopic Environmental Reconnaissance And Land-Mapping Device (GERALD), via keyboard commands or a joystick. The craft is able to transform between three configurations: a ball, an inverted square pyramid, and a gyroscope, although the difference between each configuration is only visual. Players navigate the probe through the stages to explore the world within a time limit. The time limit can be extended by collecting power jewels scattered through the world and is decreased by falling off a stage. Stages feature ramps, corridors, and other obstacles that hinder the player from quickly traversing them. The game ends when time expires or the world is completely explored.  Development and release  Spindizzy was developed by Paul Shirley of British video game developer Electric Dreams Software. He was primarily inspired by Ultimate Play the Game games that feature an isometric projection, but was also influenced by the gameplay of the 1984 arcade game Marble Madness. Shirley created an interpreted script to generate the game's levels. The script allowed him to design a large number of stages using 11KB of storage. The game was originally released for the Commodore 64 and Amstrad CPC. It was later ported to Atari 8-bit, ZX Spectrum, and Apple II computers. Spindizzy cartridges were promoted as prizes in magazine contests upon its release. American video game company Activision published the game in the United States as part of its \\"Electric Dreams\\" series. John Sanderson programmed the Apple II version; Shirley was unaware of the port's existence until the mid-1990s. Spindizzy was later re- released as part of an Activision compilation. The company sold Spindizzys compilation rights not long after obtaining them, which reduced the amount of royalties to Shirley and Electric Dreams. Shirley eventually severed the contract with Activision, citing late royalty payments among other actions he disagreed with.  Reception and legacy  Spindizzy sold well in the United Kingdom. Shirley described the game's marketing life as short and attributed that to Activision's business practices. James Hague of Dadgum Games commented that Spindizzy could have been an \\"all-time classic\\" had it received a proper marketing campaign. The game was well received by video game journalists upon its release. Zzap!64 awarded Spindizzy a Gold Medal. Tony Hetherington of Computer Gamer listed it as one of the essential Spectrum titles of 1986. Praise from reviewers focused on the game's visuals and design, while criticism focused on the audio. Three of Zzap!64s reviewers‚ÄîJulian Rignall, Gary Liddon, and Gary Penn‚Äîcalled the graphics \\"amazing\\", well-executed, and \\"varied\\"; but they described the audio as sparse. Rignall and Penn complimented the challenging gameplay and commented that its addictiveness outweighed any frustration experienced while playing. The three summarized by urging readers to purchase the game. Computer Gamer reviewer Mike Roberts praised Spindizzys gameplay, but mentioned that the screen's orientation can require a period of adjustment, particularly when using a joystick. Crashs reviewer called Spindizzy \\"one of the most addictive\\" ZX Spectrum games, noting its innovative use of shape changing, multiple view angles, and speed control. The audio was seen as lacking compared to the rest of the game, but was still described as good. Phil South of Your Sinclair gave the game high marks for graphics, playability, value for money, and addictiveness. He praised the ability to change viewpoints and the realistic movements of the character sprite. He also lauded the speed and quality of the graphics. Info gave the Commodore 64 version four stars out of five, describing it as \\"a hot little number with much of the appeal of Marble Madness\\" but better; \\"Yep, it's a winner ... Recommended\\". Roy Wagner reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"This game has a lot to offer and is an excellent value.\\" More than a decade later, reviews still praised the game. Allgame editor Ryan Glover called Spindizzy an \\"innovative puzzler\\" that prompts players to fully explore it. Saying that the game successfully mixed infuriating moments with brilliant design, Darran Jones of Retro Gamer called Spindizzy a \\"timeless classic\\". The magazine rated Spindizzy the second best game with an isometric perspective, citing its presentation and stage designs. Reviewers drew comparisons to Marble Madness, which was ported to home platforms the same year. Roberts called Spindizzy the \\"best 'marble' game yet\\", and Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World called it \\"a thoroughly enjoyable game\\" superior to Marble Madness. South described Spindizzy as the \\"closest thing yet to Marble Madness\\" on the ZX Spectrum, while Liddon said that any similarities to Marble Madness were coincidental. Many publications commented that the game was obviously inspired by Marble Madness. Over 25 years after its release, Retro Gamer called the game \\"intensely devious and addictive\\" and added that \\"Spindizzys only enemy was yourself\\". Spindizzys isometric design partially inspired Glenn Corpes during the development of the 1989 title Populous. Activision released a sequel titled Spindizzy Worlds for Amiga and Atari ST computers in 1990. The game features similar gameplay, but improved graphics and larger playing fields. It was later ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by ASCII, which Shirley disapproved of and considered it a \\"disaster\\". He took legal action over the span of several years to obtain royalty information and payments.

Matveyev. Count Andrey Artamonovich Matveev () (1666‚Äì1728) was a Russian statesman of the Petrine epoch best remembered as one of the first Russian ambassadors and Peter the Great's agent in London and the Hague. Andrey Matveyev was the son of the more famous Artamon Matveyev by a Scottish woman, Eudoxia Hamilton. At the age of eight he was granted a rank of chamber stolnik (–∫–æ–º–Ω–∞—Ç–Ω—ã–π —Å—Ç–æ–ª—å–Ω–∏–∫) but was exiled together with his father during Feodor III's early reign. The Matveyevs returned to Moscow on 11 May 1682, and four days later Artamon Matveyev was killed by the rebellious Streltsy during the Moscow Uprising of 1682, while Andrey fled the capital again. In 1691‚Äì1693 he served as voyevoda in the Dvina Region. Peter the Great, who had deeply respected Matveyev the elder and whose own mother had been brought up in the Matveyev family, sent him in 1700 as ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary, firstly in the Dutch Republic (1699‚Äì1712), afterwards in Austria (1712‚Äì1715), where he was granted in 1715 a comital title of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1705, Matveev did not succeed in his Paris mission to treat with France on trade issues. He then settled in London with the purpose of persuading Queen Anne to mediate between Sweden and Russia and not to acknowledge Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski as King of Poland. Just before leaving England, Matveyev was accosted and apprehended by some bailiffs, \\"a Brutal sort of People\\", who made his release contingent on payment of 50 pounds. Having suffered verbal and physical abuse, Matveyev reported to the Russian Foreign Office that the English \\"have no respect for common law whatsoever\\". Despite subsequent apologies from the Parliament and the Queen, the diplomatic corps in London raised such an outcry over the incident that it led the Parliament to adopt the Act Preserving the Privileges of Ambassadors (April 21, 1709), the first-ever act to guarantee diplomatic immunity. In 1716, Matveyev was recalled to St Petersburg, where he received the rank of Privy Counsellor and was appointed to run a naval academy. Three years later, he became Senator and President of Justice Collegium. For three years before his retirement in 1727 he presided over the senate office in Moscow. His daughter Maria ‚Äî rumoured to have been the tsar's mistress ‚Äî was the mother of Field- Marshal Peter Rumyantsev. In his declining years, presumably influenced by Pyotr Shafirov's research on Russian history, Matveyev described the Moscow Uprising of 1682, appending a summary account of the subsequent events up to 1698. The book is written in florid, antiquated language replete with outlandish spellings. It has a tangible bias: the actions of tsarevna Sofia and her party are painted as evil, while those of the Naryshkins and the author's father are immoderately glorified.

Freshly forged iron fireplace pokers. A fire iron is any metal instrument for tending a fire. Types There are three types of tools commonly used to tend a small fire, such as an indoor fireplace fire or yule log: the spade, the tongs and the poker itself. These tools make it possible to handle a fire without risk of burns or blisters. A fireplace poker, (also known as a fire iron) is a short, rigid rod made of fireproof material used to adjust coal and wood fuel burning in a fireplace, and can be used to stir up a fire. A fireplace poker is usually metallic and has a point at one end for pushing burning materials (or a hook for pulling/raking, or a combination) and a handle at the opposite end, sometimes with an insulated grip. Iron is the most popular metal from which the pokers are wrought. Brass is a more expensive alternative for a home poker set. A slice bar has a flatter tip and can be used to stir up the fire or to clear the grates of ashes. Other fires irons include the fire rake (not to be confused with the firefighter's tool), fire tongs and fire shovel. Many fireplace sets also include a small broom for sweeping up ash.  Japan  In Japan, traditional fire-tending device for a Japanese brazier (hibachi) is a pair of long metal chopsticks, called , used to pick up and manipulate the charcoal.  Steam locomotives  As a steam locomotive runs, by-products are produced by the coal fire such as ash and clinker. If these waste products are allowed to build up in the fire, there would be an adverse effect on the performance of the locomotive. A fireman will employ various fire irons in order to clean the fire, whilst the locomotive stands. Below is a list of different types of fire iron that would typically be carried aboard a locomotive during operation. Note: not all the fire irons listed would be carried at once, only the ones needed: * dart: The dart is a long straight fire iron that is used to break up coal that has caked together or to search for clinker * curved iron: The curved iron is a fire iron that is curved at the end. It is used to manipulate the fire so as to remove ash and clinker. This can be accomplished by either moving the good fire to one side so ash and clinker may be accessed or it may be used to knock ash through the ash pan without disturbing the fire. * t-iron: The t-iron has the same function as the curved iron, the main difference being it has a curved stem allowing the fireman to clean underneath the fire door. * clinker shovel: The clinker shovel is employed to remove clinker or other waste products that are too large to fit through the gaps in the firebars. It may also be employed to remove cold waste products before lighting a new fire. * ashpan rake: The ashpan rake has a metal piece attached to the end of a rod and is used to withdraw ash from the ashpan to prevent it from becoming clogged. History The earliest and most primitive pokers were likely made from the same material as the fuel (that is, wood in the form of a hefty branch). This ersatz wooden-type fire-tool may be called a poker or a \\"firestick\\" in colloquial terminology. The first successful mass production of stokers as a part of an entire fireplace-regalia set was designed and manufactured in Cape Girardeau, Missouri by the RL Hendrickson Manufacturing Corporation in 1898 at a cost of US$1. Today, one of the sets in fair condition can garner more than US$3500 at auction.

His portrait appeared on the 100-lat banknote prior to the Lat being replaced by the Euro in 2014, his being the only human face of an actual person on modern Latvian currency. Barons was very prominent among the Young Latvians, and also an important writer and editor. Latvju dainas=Background and importance The original Cabinet of Folksongs at the National Library of Latvia Barons is well known as the creator of Latvju dainas (LD), published between 1894 and 1915 in six volumes, and including 217 996 folk songs. But Barons was not the author of the original idea, neither did he collect the texts, nor rewrite all of the received texts on the tiny paper slips of the famous Cabinet of Folksongs (Dainu skapis), though there is a significant number of the slips displaying Barons' own handwriting, as some may believe. Still, his contribution is of no less importance. He elaborated the classification system of LD, arranging the texts and introducing the notion of song type or bush (choosing a text as the main one among a number of similar ones, and grouping the rest around it ‚Äì this allows for easier perception of variation and saves space in the published edition, as only the differences are indicated in print). Barons had also edited some texts, in order to restore their possible older and better form. In recognition of the Barons' labors and the historical value of the Cabinet of Folksongs, the work was inscribed on UNESCO's Memory of the World Register in 2001. Already at the time when Barons was working on the edition, the traditional singing had been lost to a great extent; Barons in his introduction to LD mentions that \\"the sources of nation's memory, as it seemed, filled up and having run dry long ago, started to flow amazingly.\\" He also warns that \\"the old ladies, our purest source of folk songs, become rarer and rarer with each day\\". Barons also points at the Latvians themselves turning away from the singing of traditional songs when accepting Christianity for example. Publication On the title page of LD, Kri≈°jƒÅnis Barons is not the only publisher indicated. Besides his name there is also that of Henrijs Visendorfs (1861‚Äì1916). Barons, in the same introduction to LD, wrote: \\"Then in the month of January 1892 I was surprised by a kind letter from St. Petersburg, from Mr. Wissendorff, in which he offered his support for the publication of the edition. We soon achieved our agreement on this.\\" Visendorfs was a well-to-do Latvian merchant, with his own office at the famous St. Petersburg Gostinnij Dvor. He had gotten interested in Latvian culture before, supporting researchers and editions, and writing about Latvian mythology himself (although these writings were not met with enthusiasm by the academic scholars). Visendorfs later provided Barons with copies of collections from the Jelgava Latvian Society Department of Literature. By the publication of Volume 1 of LD, he had submitted to Barons 12,800 song texts, acquired \\"with the help of local collectors\\"; altogether his collection contains 28 406 texts. It is likely that based on the popular idea of that time, that of the Latvian-Lithuanian great nation, he suggested to Barons the word \\"daina\\", which is actually Lithuanian, and which became the title of the edition. The first volume was published in Jelgava, funded by Visendorfs himself. But it turned out to be rather costly, and Visendorfs, using his connections, organised the publication of the other volumes with the help of the Imperial Academy of Sciences. In 1900 it was officially settled and from 1903 till 1915 the other volumes were published. These volumes, in addition to the previous two title pages in different languages (Latvian and French), received one more in Russian. Although Visendorfs took no part in editing and arranging the texts, his contribution performing organisational tasks, reading the preprints of the volumes published in St. Petersburg and providing his advice was significant enough to earn a place for his name on the title page, although Prof. Pƒìteris ≈†mits objected to it. In 1893 Krisjanis Barons returned to Latvia with his Cabinet of Folksongs, at that time containing around 150,000 texts. The index to LD shows more than 900 contributors, among them 237 male informants, 137 female informants, while of collectors only 54 are laies, at least 150 were school teachers, 50 were men of letters and 20 were priests. Barons, without exact account, indicates the total number of texts used to be 217 996; this number is usually quoted as that of the songs published. Still, as LD was created based on collection by local people, it doesn't cover comprehensively the whole territory of Latvia. 218 Latvian civil parishes were not represented, not even with a single text. To collect from the mute parishes, 30 years after the publication of LD was started, Latviesu folkloras krƒÅtuve began its activities. Whatever the other editions there are and will be in the future, LD has become the most quoted and referred to, as testified by two repeated editions ‚Äì in 1922‚Äì1923 and 1989‚Äì1994. Legacy Barons on a 100-lat banknote Barons efforts to collect folklore and dainas were vital for the emergence of Dievturƒ´ba, a Baltic neopagan movement established by Ernests Brasti≈Ü≈° and KƒÅrlis Marovskis-Breg≈æis in the 1920s. A minor planet 3233 Kri≈°barons, discovered by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh in 1977 is named after him. One of the main streets in Riga, Kri≈°jƒÅna Barona iela, is named after him. His descendants are currently residing in the United States, primarily located in a small town in western Pennsylvania called Grove City.

As of 2009, Delmar was living in the north London suburb of Hadley Wood.  Early life  Elaine Delmar was born on 1 September 1939 in Harpenden, in the English county of Hertfordshire. Her parents were father Jiver Hutchinson, a jazz trumpeter born in Jamaica, and mother Phyllis, both of whom moved to the UK in the 1930s. She spent her childhood with her younger brother and sister living in North London, where she attended the Trinity Grammar School in Wood Green (now known as Woodside High School. She began learning the piano when she was six, going on to play the instrument on the radio during the BBC's Children's Hour when she was thirteen. She began touring with her father at the age of sixteen, singing with his band at performances in venues such as US Air Force bases. She was on tour with him when he was killed in a road accident in 1959. Career=Singer Delmar's professional singing career began in the mid-1950s when she was selected by bassist Coleridge Goode and Lauderic Caton to sing with their quartet, The Dominoes. She spent a month with them at the Club Ecstase in Bad Harzburg, Germany. Goode later said in his autobiography that \\"I think it's fair to say that we started off her career\\". Delmar left the Dominoes after her spell with them in Germany and launched a solo career, including playing at clubs and carrying out overseas tours. During 2010 she featured in concert with Wynton Marsalis's Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra. Acting Delmar made her first stage appearance in the late 1950s when she was cast in the play Finian's Rainbow in a revival production in Liverpool. She then joined the cast of the Richard Rodgers musical drama No Strings in London's West End, as an understudy for Beverly Todd. In 1972 she was part of the original London cast of the musical Cowardy Custard at the Mermaid Theatre, which was based on the songs of Noel Coward. In 1977 she took on her biggest stage position, a starring role in Bubbling Brown Sugar, and then went on to appear in both the London and Broadway versions of Jerome Kern in Hollywood. Another role, in which she was casts purely as an actress, was A Map Of The World at the Royal National Theatre. She was cast as the Bohemian Princess in the Ken Russell film Mahler.

Early life and education  Whitney was born on September 11, 1847, in Waltham, Massachusetts. Her mother was Mary Watson Crehore and her father was Samuel Buttrick Whitney. Her father was successful in real estate and wealthy enough to provide her with a good education for a woman at the time. She went to school in Waltham where she excelled in mathematics and graduated from the public high school in 1863. She was privately tutored for one year before she entered Vassar College in 1865, where she met the astronomer Maria Mitchell. During her time at Vassar College, her father died and her brother was lost at sea. She obtained her degree in 1868. From 1869 to 1870, she took some courses about quaternions and celestial mechanics by Benjamin Peirce (at Harvard). At the time, women could not be admitted to Harvard so she attended as a guest. She obtained her master's degree from Vassar in 1872, afterwards she went to Z√ºrich for 3 years where she studied mathematics and celestial mechanics.  Professional career  Returning to the US, she became a teacher at her hometown high school until she became an assistant of Maria Mitchell in Vassar. In 1888 upon the retirement of Mitchell she became a professor and the director of the observatory there until she retired in 1915 for health reasons. During her career, she concentrated on teaching and research related to double stars, variable stars, asteroids, comets, and measurements by photographic plates. Under her direction, 102 articles were published at the Vassar Observatory. In 1889 her mother and sister both became ill and Whitney moved them to the Observatory where she could care for them and continue her work part-time. When they died two years later, she resumed full-time work. Whitney was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and a charter member of the Astronomical and Astrophysical Society. Mary Whitney believed that science provided strong career opportunities for women. She hoped that women would soon become more active in practical chemistry, architecture, dentistry, and agriculture, which were more lucrative and, in Whitney‚Äôs view, particularly well suited to women. Moreover, she believed that scientific training would prepare them to be good mothers, falling into more traditional tropes of the early 20th century. Later life Mary Whitney died in Waltham on January 20, 1921, of pneumonia.

Veikko Huovinen (7 May 1927 ‚Äì 4 October 2009) Veikko Huovinen (1927‚Äì2009) in memoriam was a Finnish novelist and forester. As a novelist, his writing was known for its realism, pacifism, sharp intellect, and peculiar humor. He wrote 37 books. One of his books, the 1980 novel Dog Nail Clipper was adapted into a critically well-received 2004 film of the same name. Early life Huovinen was born in Simo, Finland. When he was six months old, his family moved to Sotkamo, where he lived until his death. As a child, Huovinen was known as well-mannered, yet he had a reputation for outlandish stories and occasional mischief. He went to high school in Kajaani, but his studies were interrupted in 1944 when he served as a volunteer AA gunner in the Finnish Army. He graduated after the war in 1946, enrolling in the University of Helsinki, from where he graduated with a M.A. in forestry in 1952. Huovinen worked as a forester from 1953 to 1956, until becoming a full-time author. In 1999, he was awarded an honorary professorship for his services to Finnish literature. He was married and had 3 children. Literary career Huovinen started writing in 1949 when working in a fire watch post in Vuokatti. His first short story collection, Hirri was published in 1950, followed by the novel Havukka-ahon Ajattelija in 1952. Both of these concern the life and its peculiarities in the Kainuu region in Finland, written in a unique style of humor and characterized by their inventive use of language. The main character in Havukka-ahon Ajattelija, Konsta Pylkk√§nen, has since become ingrained into Finnish modern folklore as the archetype of a rustic, backwoods philosopher. Huovinen's further works never strayed far from humor, but started to exhibit the author's pacifistic philosophies and later took a turn towards black humor. A good example of such is the trilogy, referred by the author as \\"Three devilish mustached men\\"; Veitikka ‚Äì A. Hitlerin el√§m√§ ja teot, Joe-set√§ and Pietari Suuri hatun polki, concerning Adolf Hitler, Joseph Stalin and Peter the Great respectively. Veitikka prompted some controversy at the time, as it portrays Hitler in a humoristic light. Huovinen countered the claims of impropriety by contending that by laughing at dictators, one strips them of their power to influence people. Veitikka is ostensibly a researched study into the character of Hitler, but the totally outlandish stories quickly betray the book as a work of fiction. The two subsequent books follow the same pattern of telling a ridiculous history of the dictators while letting the author lament the effects such people have on mankind. Huovinen's 1980 novel Koirankynnen leikkaaja (translation: Dog Nail Clipper) was adapted into a 2004 film of the same name, directed by Markku P√∂l√∂nen and starred by Peter Franz√©n. In spite of low profits, the film was critically acclaimed receiving positive reviews and winning several major film awards. Dog Nail Clipper was the most successful film at the 2005 Jussi Awards winning in five categories including Best Film, Best Actor, and Best Direction.5 Jussis for Dog Nail Clipper, Cineuropa.com, February 8, 2005.

It was the last squadron flying the Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler. Mission Its mission was to support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force (MAGTF) commander by conducting airborne electronic warfare, day or night, under all weather conditions during expeditionary, joint, or combined operations. The squadron was based at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina and fell under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 14 (MAG-14) and the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (2nd MAW). History VMAQ-2's predecessor squadrons flew various electronic warfare aircraft, including the AD-5 Skyraider, the EF-10 Skyknight, and the EA-6A Intruder. VMC-2 was the original composite squadron (combined aerial photographic reconnaissance and electronic warfare capability) in Marine Corps aviation. It was commissioned at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point on September 15, 1952 evolving from the former Airborne Early Warning and Electronic Counter Measures section of the Wing Headquarters Squadron. On December 1, 1955, the squadron was redesignated as VMCJ-2 after former Marine Photographic Squadron 2 (VMJ-2) was decommissioned and joined VMC-2, and became VMCJ-2 (Marine Composite Jamming Squadron 1). As 1955 was also the year Playboy magazine was first published, it soon followed that the squadron adopted the Playboy name and logo with their permission. In December 1960, VMCJ-2 provided electronic and photographic intelligence during the Cuban Missile Crisis that enabled President Kennedy to make key decisions that would lead to the removal of Soviet military equipment from Cuba. In 1964 VMCJ-2 participated in Operation Steel Pike, the largest amphibious training exercise in history. The unit sailed from Morehead City, NC to the Naval Base at Rota, Spain and flew both photographic and electronic warfare missions during the exercise. Vietnam War A F3D-2Q and a F8U-1P of VMCJ-2 in flight, circa 1958. Less than three years after the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis, some of the same VMCJ-2 aircrews deployed with VMCJ-1 to Vietnam and applied their lessons learned against Cuba as the EF-10Bs began to provide ECM support for air strikes against North Vietnamese targets. Beginning in the Spring of 1966 the squadron began sending Marines to join VMCJ-1 in Vietnam for 13-month tours. In late November 1965, VMCJ-2 received the first EA-6A Electric Intruder. With the rapidly escalating North Vietnamese air defenses this new EW aircraft was anxiously awaited by VMCJ-1 still flying the outdated EF-10B Skyknights, However, the initial EW systems delivered with the new aircraft proved unsuitable for the mission without some major modifications. Given the urgency, the decision was made to make the modifications by a contractor team on-site at VMCJ-2. The success of this effort was due to the dedicated support of VMCJ-2 personnel who worked tirelessly to get the aircraft ready for deployment to Vietnam. EA-6A Intruder of VMCJ-2 aboard in September 1974 wearing the Playboy unit markings During this same time period the squadron received the first of its RF-4Bs and for several months the squadron was flying four different aircraft types. In October, 1966 VMCJ-2 sent six EA-6As with full maintenance capability to Danang, Vietnam as a VMCJ-1 replacement cadre. The squadron would continue to provide replacement aircrews and updated aircraft to VMCJ-1 in Vietnam. In 1971 the squadron deployed the first EA-6A detachment aboard for a Mediterranean cruise that lasted 10 months with cross decking to and . In April 1972 the squadron diverted an EA-6A detachment that was scheduled to deploy on the Saratoga in the Mediterranean to WESTPAC to join VMCJ-1 at NAS Cubi Point. The VMCJ-2 detachment operated in concert with VMCJ-1 to support strikes against North Vietnam under Operation Linebacker that ended with the release of the U.S. POWs early in 1973.  Cold War sea service  After its re-designation in 1975, VMAQ-2 deployed detachments of EA-6A Electric Intruder aircraft [designated Detachments Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie] and EA-6B Prowler aircraft [designated Detachments Xray, Yankee, and Zulu] on a continuous basis in support of Marine forces in the Western Pacific and in support of Fleet Commanders on aircraft carriers, including lengthy deployments on the , , , and . In 1977, the squadron transitioned to the EA-6B Prowler with the Improved Capability (ICAP) EW suite. In 1986, a detachment of the squadron participated in U.S. raids against Libya as part of Operation El Dorado Canyon. The Persian Gulf War and the Balkans In 1990, VMAQ-2 deployed Detachments Yankee and Zulu to Bahrain in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, flying nearly 500 combat sorties in a six-week period. Detachment X-Ray was already forward deployed with the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing in the Western Pacific for their routine six-month rotation and would remain there for a total of 410 days - more than double their scheduled deployment time - the longest continuous deployment in Marine aviation history during peacetime. On 1 July 1992, VMAQ-2, the largest tactical squadron in Marine Aviation, was reorganized into three squadrons: VMAQ-1 \\"Banshees\\", VMAQ-2 \\"Playboys\\", and VMAQ-3 \\"Moondogs\\". In 1993, outside pressure forced the Marine Corps to direct the squadron to change their name and logo from \\"Playboys\\" to something more politically correct. After several ideas were rejected the squadron chose \\"Panthers\\" as the new name and began using the logo (with permission) of the National Football League's Carolina Panthers. VMAQ-2 later changed from the \\"Panthers\\" to the current name \\"Death Jesters\\". Even with the name changes the squadron continues to use \\"Playboy\\" Bunny patches and paint jobs on their five aircraft. Even the CY tail code was fashioned on some in the shape of a bunny head. VMAQ-2‚Äôs next assignment led them to Aviano Air Base, Italy, in March 1996 in support of Operation Decisive Endeavor. This operation tasked VMAQ-2 with missions over Bosnia and Herzegovina. Specifically, VMAQ-2 Prowlers provided Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) support to British Harriers performing reconnaissance flights over weapons containment sites in these two areas of operation. In 1997, VMAQ-2 once again deployed to Aviano Air Base. However, this time it was in support of Operation Deliberate Guard. VMAQ-2 was tasked with flying missions over Bosnia to cover the Bosnian elections. On February 3, 1998 a USMC Grumman EA-6B Prowler, BuNo 163045, callsign \\"Easy 0-1\\" from VMAQ-2, struck a cable supporting a gondola in Cavalese, Italy. The cable was severed and 20 people in the cabin plunged over 80 metres to their deaths. The plane had wing and tail damage but was able to return to the base.Stamford, Lincs., U.K.: Air Forces Monthly, May 1998, Number 122, page 59. It was the squadron's first major mishap in over 60,000 flight hours spanning nearly fifteen years of worldwide operations. In February 1999, VMAQ-1, VMAQ-2, VMAQ-3, and VMAQ-4 received the order to again deploy to Aviano Air Base in Italy in support of Operation Noble Anvil and possible subsequent combat operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. After diplomatic attempts to resolve the Kosovo crisis failed, Operation Allied Force began. VMAQ-2 launched day and night sorties to provide jamming and HARM support to U.S. and NATO missions. VMAQ-2 also provided support for armed reconnaissance missions, day and night battlefield air interdiction strikes, and combat search and rescue efforts of downed allied aircrew. When Operation Allied Force came to an end, VMAQ-2 had flown 2151.5 combat hours, 464 combat sorties, and fired 57 High speed Anti- Radiation Missiles (HARM) against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Global War on Terrorism An EA-6B Prowler from VMAQ-2 over Iraq in 2004. In February 2003, VMAQ-2 deployed to Prince Sultan Air Base, Saudi Arabia, initially in support of Operation ENDURING FREEDOM and then Operation IRAQI FREEDOM. VMAQ-2 logged over 1000 combat hours in under 60 days in the war to liberate Iraq. VMAQ-2 deployed to Tallil Air Base, Iraq, for Operation IRAQI FREEDOM II from July 2004 through January 2005 and became the first Prowler squadron to operate from Iraqi soil. The squadron logged over 2000 mishap-free combat hours and attained 10,000 Mishap Free Flight Hours during the same period. VMAQ-2 was subsequently chosen as the Marine Corps Aviation Association 2005 Prowler squadron of the year. In January 2006, VMAQ-2 deployed to Al Asad, Iraq in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM 05-07. VMAQ-2 flew 691 combat missions for 3286.7 combat flight hours and supported 975 Joint Tactical Air Requests (JTARS). This rigorous operational tempo resulted in four times the normal airframe utilization rate. In July 2007, VMAQ-2 returned to Al Asad, Iraq in support of Operation IRAQI FREEDOM 06-08. During the deployment, VMAQ-2 flew 821 combat missions for a total of 4423.0 combat flight hours while supporting Coalition ground forces. This sustained tempo led not only to the highest utilization rate for any Prowler squadron but also for any Type/Model/Series in the Marine Corps. In November 2018, VMAQ-2 returned from performing the final deployed operations of USMC Prowlers.\\"Marine Corps' Last Prowler Aircraft Return from Final Combat Deployment\\".

Founded by John R Elliott BEM there General Manager. They currently compete in the and play their home matches at The Boundary Stadium on Altham Way. The club is affiliated to the Hertfordshire Football Association. History Oxhey Jets Football Club was formed in 1972 as a youth team, before progressing into a senior team in the early 1980s. The Jets joined the Herts Senior County League in 1981, competing in Division One. After gaining promotion in 1989, the club spent fifteen seasons in the Premier Division before being rewarded with a place in the Spartan South Midlands League in 2004. The 2004‚Äì05 season saw The Jets gain their second successive promotion when they became Spartan South Midlands League Division One champions. As a result of competing in the Premier Division in the 2005‚Äì06 season, they were able to make their debut in the FA Cup. Unfortunately, The Jets lost at home to Lowestoft Town in the preliminary round. In February 2012, Oxhey Jets became only the second ever Spartan South Midlands League club to reach the final of the Herts Senior Cup, when they overcame Cheshunt in the semi-final. They were beaten 7‚Äì2 in the final by Bishop's Stortford.

It was available on cassette as well as 5.25\\" disc for the BBC and ROM cartridge for the Acorn Electron Plus 1 expansion module. The game was written by Peter Irvin who, along with Jeremy Smith, went on to create the arcade adventure Exile. Gameplay Acorn Electron version in play The player assumes the role of captain of a battle starship, charged with defending the frontiers of space from hostile alien ships, which come in two sizes ‚Äî large and small. Some of the larger ships have cloaking devices which make them invisible. Damage is inflicted on ships when they are shot or rammed by other ships. The player vessel remains locked in the centre of the screen and the world rotates and moves around it. Player shots also have limited range and are subject to the same rotation as everything else, which means the player needs to predict where shots will need to go in order to hit the enemies. The ship has both long range scanners and shields but may only use one at a time. By default, the game will automatically switch between them based on the proximity of enemy vessels but the player can optionally take full control. Using shields, thrusting, turning and firing all use up energy which is also depleted when hit by enemies. Energy will automatically replenish, most quickly if the shields are off and the starship is not moving, but this leaves the player open to attack. Unusually, the player is never expected to return their ship from the frontiers. Each individual voyage is a separate command, and lasts either until the player's vessel is destroyed or until they use an escape capsule. If the escape capsule is successfully launched, which means firing it so that it doesn't collide with any enemy ships, and the player is judged by Star-Fleet to have killed enough enemies during his command then he is given a new commission and a new and visually different ship. 8 points are scored for a small ship and 12 for a large ship. Starfleet's opinion of the player's performance ranges from them being \\"furious\\" to \\"delighted\\". The number of points required to reach the next level is not fixed. Sometimes a score of 60 will suffice and sometimes a score of 80 will not be enough to guarantee automatic promotion to the next level, assuming the escape capsule was jettisoned safely. Strangely, more points were awarded when an escape capsule collided with and destroyed an enemy ship as opposed to being shot or colliding with the starship. Later commands take place in faster environments and with greater numbers of enemy. There are 8 different starship designs, which repeat after level 8. Reception Although none of the Acorn magazines were in the habit of giving review scores at the time, the game received generally very favourable reviews. Peter Gray, writing in the October 1983 edition of Electron User, concluded that \\"The game seems to have everything. The graphics are superb, the instructions thorough and, once you get used to the way your ship stays still while the aliens move, the whole thing is enthralling\\".\\"Starship Command\\" review, Electron User, October 1983 The BBC version was reviewed in Computer and Video Games and received a score of 90%.\\"Starship Command\\" review, C+VG, Issue 18, April 1983 References Category:1983 video games Category:Acornsoft games Category:BBC Micro and Acorn Electron games Category:BBC Micro and Acorn Electron-only games Category:Multidirectional shooters Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Starship Command"},{"id":"3783861","text":"Trauma shears with a 30 cm long ruler for comparison. Trauma shears, also known as Tuff Cuts (a brand name), are a type of scissors used by paramedics and other emergency medical personnel to quickly and safely cut clothing from injured people. They usually consist of a plastic handle with a metal blade, which is traditionally bent at about 150 degrees, giving them an unusual appearance as compared to normal scissors, and also a longer \\"lever arm\\". The shears were designed exclusively for external use and are not suitable for surgical or invasive procedures. Their rugged construction enables them to cut through strong materials such as car seat belts, leather, and denim, and even thin metal and other hard surfaces (including a U.S. penny). They are increasingly being used by fishermen, soldiers and scuba divers as safer alternatives to knives. The wide, blunt tip on the shears is designed to slide across skin, minimizing the risk of injuring the patient while cutting clothing. Bandage scissors are similar in design, though smaller, and are primarily used for sizing or removing dressings and bandages.

He has produced record covers and book covers for Brian Eno, the Cocteau Twins, Michael Nyman, David Sylvian, Peter Gabriel, and Nine Inch Nails. As a recording artist he has collaborated with many musicians, for example David Sylvian, Ian McCulloch and Peter Gabriel. He has released 3 CDs with his recording project Undark, one of them on the British ambient label Em:t Records. The last, Pearl + Umbra was released on Bella Union, to very respectable reviews. He was Visiting Tutor (until 2012) at the Royal College of Art, Visiting Professor at the Glasgow School of Art. Emergence as music packaging designer In the 1980s, Mills began receiving commissions to design record album covers and associated packaging. Stylistically, his work at this time became much more abstract, abandoning figurative representation in favour of symbolic allusions. He regularly treated the canvas as a sculptural plane, with materials such as metals, powders, bones, feathers, beeswax, fabric, wires, animal skins and papers embedded in thick paints and pastes. Works of this period generally occupy the entirety of the canvas with little or no \\"negative space\\" left. Notable album covers include: * Roger Eno, Between Tides * Japan, Exorcising Ghosts * Harold Budd and Brian Eno, The Pearl * Roger Eno, Voices * David Sylvian, Gone to Earth * Michael Brook, Hybrid * Nine Inch Nails, The Downward Spiral, Hesitation Marks * The Overload (illustration for the Talking Heads song in their book, What the Songs Look Like) An analysis of the symbolic meaning of the elements used to create the cover for Roger Eno's Between Tides appears in the 1999 book 100 Best Album Covers, edited by Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell (of the design group Hipgnosis.) Work with Nine Inch Nails Russell Mills worked with Nine Inch Nails in 1994-1997 and again in 2012-15. In 1994, he was commissioned to create the entire visual world of The Downward Spiral, beginning with the artwork for that album's cover and booklet, and extending to all of the associated singles (including March of the Pigs and Closer to God), the remix collection Further Down the Spiral, the 1997 videocassette compilation Closure, the 2004 Deluxe Edition and DualDisc re-releases of The Downward Spiral, (which was accompanied by several new Mills compositions downloadable from the Nine Inch Nails website), and various promotional materials. These interrelated works contain Mills' heaviest use of organic materials to depict a sense of fragility and decay. Animal skeletons, sets of teeth, blood, feathers, and dead insects are liberally embedded in the canvases. In some pieces, materials have been affixed and then exposed to water or chemical elements, so that their decay is literally imprinted on the surface of the artwork. In 2012 work began on the cover art for the album Hesitation Marks, released in 2013, and subsequently an art book called Cargo in the Blood, released in December 2015. Advent of digital design From the later 1990s to the present, Mills' work has again evolved to a new style, made possible by the advent of computer design applications such as Photoshop. The \\"collage\\" aesthetic is still frequently seen, but now in a virtual/digital form, with many abutting and overlapping semi-transparent images, often cropped into crisp, aligned rectangles. Mills still uses hand-drawn or -painted imagery, but as often as not it is scanned into the computer and treated as another malleable collage element. Images of water and sky are frequently seen, and a cooler color palette often prevails (in contrast to an earlier reliance on earth tones). Negative space is still a rarity in Mills' compositions. It is worth noting that many of the musicians who choose Mills as an illustrator compose music that is \\"ambient\\" to varying degrees. Many of the album covers visually reflect this, in that they can be viewed quickly for an overall emotional impression, while intense perusal reveals many painstakingly layered details. Notable album covers from 1995 to the present include: * Ocean of Sound and Haunted Weather, both compiled by David Toop * Panthalassa: The Music of Miles Davis 1969‚Äì1974, Miles Davis * BBC Sessions, Cocteau Twins * Dead Bees on a Cake and associated singles, David Sylvian * The Redesign, Bill Laswell (under the pseudonym of \\"Operazone\\") * Several albums by Michael Nyman, reissued in 2005 Music In addition to soundtracking several multimedia exhibits (see below), Russell Mills has released two albums to date: * Undark (1996) (re-released in 2000 as \\"Undark One: Strange Familiar\\") * Pearl + Umbra (1999) (re-released in 2000 as \\"Undark Two: Pearl + Umbra\\") Both albums originated from Mills \\"collecting sounds\\" from musicians, many of whose albums he has illustrated. He then collaged the organic and electronic sounds into ambient pieces (with one or two vocal \\"songs\\" per album), with varying degrees of collaboration with the originating artists.

It was originally written by Chris Myers and Bryan D. O'Connor in Washington University as a replacement of the BSD FTP daemon, for use in the Washington University network, primarily the large wuarchive site. The software eventually evolved to lend itself as a replacement in other mainstream commercial operating systems of the time, including DEC's Ultrix, IBM's AIX and Sun's SunOS and Solaris operating systems. It was also soon ported to other operating systems rooted in open source, such as FreeBSD and Linux. The software had fallen into disrepair during the mid-1990s until its stewardship was taken over by Stan O. Barber. He released a number of patches, which were named the ACADEM series, named after his company, Academ Consulting Services. After a few years the source code was taken over by Gregory Lundberg who consolidated the ACADEM and other patches and enhanced the software, again through another series of patches called the VR series, named after VRNet, his then company. Around 1999, the project's oversight was provided by a loose group of developers working as the WU-FTPD Development Group, which counted Gregory Lundberg among them. Around 2002, he left the project for personal reasons and it went dormant, with only Kent Landfield of the Landfield Group keeping the website and the CVS repository alive up until 2007. Today, a new series (CC) of unofficial patches was launched to try to bring the software up-to-date, again culling for patches found across the Internet. BeroFTPD was also an offshoot of WU-FTPD, which saw feature improvements made into the code. The last known release of that software was 1.3.4 before it was merged back into the WU-FTPD codebase yielding wu-ftpd-2.6.0 as a result. BeroFTPD development then ceased. Up until the early 2000s, it was the most common FTP server software in use, though its use has lessened in recent years due to availability of more feature-rich and easier-to-configure software, and primarily due to its perceived lack of security and the perceived complexity of the source code. In 2001, for example, the Ramen worm used WU-FTPD as one of the possible intrusion mechanisms.

That piece of data is usually an abstract number or, in some cases, a set of dice. Some games use different terms to refer to an attribute, such as statistic, (primary) characteristic or ability. A number of role-playing games like Fate do not use attributes at all. The nature of attributes There is no uniform consensus on what ability scores are, even if many role-playing games have them, but games that use them have a common theme. According to the BBC Cult TV website \\"All characters have Attributes ‚Äî basic physical and mental abilities.\\"BBC Cult TV - Buffy the Vampire Slayer RPG and in the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game \\"Each character has six ability scores that represent his character's most basic attributes. They are his raw talent and prowess. While a character rarely rolls a check using just an ability score, these scores, and the modifiers they create, affect nearly every aspect of a character's skills and abilities.\\"Pathfinder PRD In some games, such as older versions of Dungeons & Dragons the attribute is used on its own to determine outcomes, whereas in many games, beginning with Bunnies & Burrows and including more modern versions of D&D;, the attribute works with a skill to affect the overall outcome.  Common types of attribute system  Attributes in S.C.O.U.R.G.E.: Heroes of Lesser Renown. There is no standard amongst role-playing games as to which attributes are important for the game, though there is a school of design which says you pick the attributes after you decide what the game is about.  Set attribute systems Dungeons & Dragons= Dungeons & Dragons used six attributes (there were brief attempts to add a seventh, Comeliness, in Unearthed Arcana and Dragon magazine, but this was short- lived). The six attributes used in D&D; are: ;\\"Physical\\" statistics *Strength - measuring physical power and carrying capacity *Constitution - measuring endurance, stamina and good health *Dexterity - measuring agility, balance, coordination and reflexes ;\\"Mental\\" statistics *Intelligence - measuring deductive reasoning, knowledge, memory, logic and rationality *Wisdom - measuring self-awareness, common sense, restraint, perception and insight *Charisma - measuring force of personality, persuasiveness, leadership and successful planning These range from about 3 to 20 (depending on the edition).Dungeons and Dragons 3.5e Players HandbookDungeons and Dragons 4e Players HandbookDungeons and Dragons 5e Players Handbook The attribute sequence in D&D; was originally: Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma, sometimes referred to as \\"SIWDCC\\".Dungeons and Dragons 1e Players Handbook This listed the four \\"prime requisites\\" of the character class families before the \\"general\\" stats: strength for fighters, intelligence for magic-users, wisdom for clerics, and dexterity for thieves. The current \\"SDCIWC\\" sequence was introduced in AD&D; 2nd edition in an attempt to divide physical and cognitive traits into two groups. =Other games= Many other notable games have followed suit while slightly varying the attributes, like Traveller (Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, Intelligence, Education, Social Standing) or like Cortex System games such as the Serenity RPG and the Cortex Plus Leverage with Agility, Alertness, Intelligence, Strength, Vitality, and Willpower.Cortex System Roleplaying Game Leverage: The Roleplaying Game Others use more, some fewer. Tri-Stat dX (including Big Eyes, Small Mouth), as the name would suggest, uses three (Body, Mind, and Soul), whereas a more common division of three, and used in the Cortex Plus game Firefly is Physical, Mental, and Social, but expands with the Storyteller System's attributes. SPECIAL is an acronym statistics system developed specifically for the Fallout series, representing the seven attributes used to define Fallout characters: Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility and Luck. SPECIAL is heavily based on GURPS, which was originally intended to be the character system used in the game.  Classifications  The first three editions of Shadowrun had three separate headings of Physical attributes, Mental Attributes, and Special Attributes, with three stats in each. With the six non-special attributes being Strength, Quickness, Body, Charisma, Intelligence, and Willpower, and two of the three special attributes relating to magic and the third being derived, this is arguably a six attribute system. The Storyteller System used in games like Vampire: The Masquerade took this one step further, breaking the attributes down into three by three classifications. Power, Finesse, and Resistance, and Mental, Physical, and Social, leading to nine different combinations each of which has a separate name with, for example, Mental Finesse being the attribute Wits and Social Resistance being Composure.Vampire: The Masquerade 20th Anniversary Edition  Stats and substats  Some games think that attributes are not and should not be treated as entirely independent, and therefore make a lot of their attributes dependent on others. GURPS uses two levels of statistic - four primary statistics (Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence, Health), and four statistics derived directly from those (Fatigue which defaults to strength or health depending on edition, Hit Points (health or strength depending on edition), Willpower (defaults to intelligence), and Speed (defaults to half the average of health and dexterity)). Hero System 5th edition has eight primary statistics, and a further five derived from them. Fitting the setting Some game systems such as those using the Cortex Plus system or those Powered by the Apocalypse work on the basis that the attributes should emphasise elements of the setting thus making them different from game to game even within the same family. So, for example, Dungeon World is meant to resemble a game of D&D; so it uses the same statistics as above, whereas Monsterhearts, with its mix of teen drama and paranormal romance uses the statistics Hot, Cold, Violent, and Dark.  Common attribute names  Attributes are commonly referred to by a three letter abbreviation (Str, Int, etc.).  Hard statistics  Hard statistics are those statistics which are generally physical in nature, and are often used to represent physical characteristics of a character. ;Strength aka Body, Might, Brawn, Power ... :A measure of how physically strong a character is. Strength often controls the power and/or damage of melee attacks, the maximum weight the character can carry, and sometimes hit points. Armor and weapons might also have a Strength requirement to use them. ;Constitution aka Stamina, Endurance, Vitality, Recovery ... :A measure of how sturdy a character is. Constitution often influences hit points, resistances for special types of damage (poisons, illness, heat etc.) and fatigue. ;Defense aka Resistance, Fortitude, Resilience, ... :A measure of how resilient a character is. Defense usually decreases taken damage by either a percentage or a fixed amount per hit. Occasionally combined with Constitution. ;Dexterity aka Agility, Reflexes, Quickness, ... :A measure of how agile a character is. Dexterity controls attack and movement speed and accuracy, as well as evading an opponent's attack (see Armor Class).  Soft statistics  Soft statistics are those statistics which are generally cognitive in nature, and are often used to represent nonphysical characteristics of a character. Alternatively, instead of being mental statistics, they may also represent certain nonphysical effects on a character, as with attributes such as Luck, seen below. ;Intelligence aka Intellect, Mind, Knowledge, ... :A measure of a character's problem-solving ability. Intelligence often controls a character's ability to comprehend foreign languages and their skill in magic. In some cases, intelligence controls how many skill points the character gets at \\"level up\\". In some games, it controls the rate at which experience points are earned, or the amount needed to level up. Under certain circumstances, this skill can also negate combat actions between players and NPC enemies. This is sometimes combined with wisdom and/or willpower. ;Charisma aka Presence, Charm, Social, ... :A measure of a character's social skills, and sometimes their physical appearance.

Its founder is Charles Bl√© Goud√©. Set up in June 2001, the group attracted controversy and international condemnation due to its alleged involvement in extra-judicial killings and for organising demonstrations which often turned violent. The organisation is nationalist and opposed to the Islamification of the country, with Gbagbo's supporters tend to be Christians from the south, as opposed to the rebel forces from the largely Muslim north, which fought the First Ivorian Civil War against the Gbagbo government from 2002 to 2006. The organisation itself claims that it rejects violence, and that it has been misrepresented in the Western media, especially that of France. History Bl√© Goud√© founded COJEP in June 2001, at the end of his term as the head of another youth movement in Cote D'Ivoire, after it had suffered an ideological split and become deeply politicised, with one section allying itself to a military junta within the country. The new movement he set up was fiercely supportive of Laurent Gbagbo, who had been elected in 2000. On September 26, 2002, within a week of the failed coup d'√©tat by the Ivorian army, Bl√© Goud√©, who was in Manchester finishing a degree, flew back to Abidjan to mobilise the COJEP along with several other youth movements, merging them into a more militant version of the group called Alliance des jeunes patriotes pour le sursaut national (\\"Youth Alliance for National Survival\\"). This new organisation incorporated: *COJEP ‚Äì Bl√© Goud√©'s original organisation *la F√©d√©ration des √©tudiants et scolaires de C√¥te d'Ivoire (FESCI) ‚Äì another student organisation loyal to Gbagbo *The campaign to repatriate Alassane Ouattara, an Ivorian Muslim politician and opponent of Gbagbo who originally came from Burkina Faso *Thierry Legr√©'s \\"Movement for the Republican Conscience\\" In January 2003, they prevented Dominique de Villepin, France's Minister of Foreign Affairs, from leaving the presidential palace for three-quarters of an hour. In November 2004, the Young Patriots attacked French homes and businesses, forcing thousands of white people to flee, as they were thought to be French. This was fueled by anger over France's perceived role in the then two-year-old ongoing civil war. In addition, France was said to be interfering in the economy and maintaining the country as a client state. Calls for violence against whites and non-Ivorians were broadcast on national radio and TV after the Young Patriots seized control of its offices. The attacks drew international condemnation, and Kofi Annan described the group as a militia. In October 2005, presidential elections which were due to be held in Cote d'Ivoire were cancelled, after Gbagbo used a law which allowed him to stay in power. The UN, already accused of having taken a stance sympathetic to the French as well as the northern rebels, criticised this, and this led to a series of protests in January of 2006. January 2006 events January 16, 2006, the Young Patriots were involved in violent demonstrations against the UN, and in one incident, at least four were killed after an exchange of fire at a UN peacekeeper's camp. UN peacekeepers are allowed to shoot if they come under violent attack. The crisis began after UN mediators called for the National Assembly of C√¥te d'Ivoire to be dissolved and for Gbagbo's mandate to end. During the days that followed, two thousand youths clashed with UN peacekeepers. The Young Patriots seized control of the offices of Cote d'Ivoire's state-owned television channel, RTI, and broadcast repeated messages to attack the UN base in Daloa, as well as French targets. They also reportedly ransacked a community radio station, Radio Tchrato-Daloa which had refused to let them in, as well as besieging a UN base and the French embassy for two days, until on January 20, Bl√© Goud√© called for them to go home and \\"clean up the streets\\". Ideology The Young Patriots described themselves as fighting against \\"neo-colonialism and imperialism\\". They claimed that France, which formerly colonised the country, had a stranglehold on the Ivorian economy, with most ports and major companies being French-owned. Up until the start of the civil war, millions of refugees had entered Cote D'Ivoire from neighbouring countries such as Mali, Burkina Faso, Liberia and Sierra Leone to escape hunger and conflict. This produced resentment in the native population, as immigrants provided cheap labour and were perceived to be taking their jobs, especially in poorer areas of Abidjan, where support for the Young Patriots is strongest. The Young Patriots are hostile to the rebel forces in the north of the country, which is largely dominated by Muslims, often poor migrant workers from neighbouring nations. Only people between the ages of 20 and 32, of Ivorian descent or whose parents are both Ivorian, are allowed to become members of the organisation. This policy excludes many people from the north of the country, who migrated there more than 40 years earlier, prior to the country's 1960 independence from France. The organisation has been blamed for violent attacks on \\"foreigners\\" who do not match this definition. The organisation is heavily supportive of Gbagbo, and Bl√© Goud√©, its leader, has been described as \\"the fourth most powerful man in the country\\". Despite the violent actions by some demonstrators, he compares himself to Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., and claims to use pacifist resistance.

It was Gary Oldman's debut as a writer and director; the film was produced by Oldman, Douglas Urbanski and Luc Besson. It stars Ray Winstone as Raymond, the abusive husband of Valerie (Kathy Burke). Plot In a working-class South London district live Raymond; his wife, Valerie; her brother, Billy; Valerie and Billy's mother, Janet; and their grandmother, Kathy. Billy is a drug addict, and Raymond kicks him out when he steals drugs from him. Billy hangs out with his heroin addict friends and they shoot up together. The family is dysfunctional, mostly because of Raymond's fiery temper and violent outbursts. When Valerie gets pregnant again, she continues to smoke and drink. Valerie goes out on the town, and when Ray sees an attractive male friend of hers, he flies into a jealous rage, ordering her out of the pub and into the car. Back home, he accuses her of sleeping with the male friend, and pummels her severely, causing her to miscarry. He tries to win her back, but she leaves him and prepares to start a new life without him. In an alcohol-fuelled rage, he angrily tears their flat apart. He tells Mark, his friend, that the reason for his horrible behavior is his own abusive father, who was the same way with him and his mother. Later, he tries to reconcile with Valerie; however, she is outraged, and says that when she reaches 70, she wants to look back on this part of her life, as she is now 30, as a time when she had some fun. What she has instead is people feeling sorry for her. Valerie doesn't want to return to Ray, pointing out they haven't got a home to go back to because he's smashed it all up. She will try and find someone to be with that will love her and treat her kindly. Ray goes to see Valerie and asks her if she still loves him. Ray and Valerie are eventually back together again, and Ray has fixed up the apartment. Ray speaks as crudely as ever, but begins to restrain himself from his usual angry outbursts. Billy, and his friend Danny, rob a man to support their drug habit and wind up going to prison. This not only reunites Ray with Valerie but reunites the whole family.

It has two sister magazines: Huisgenoot (aimed at White and Coloured Afrikaans-speaking readers) and YOU (aimed at demographically diverse South African English-speaking readers of different ethnicities to inform, inspire and entertain them by offering its own brand of coverage on current events and interesting people). In 2005 it was described as \\"the first black lifestyle magazine in Africa\\", but it is noted chiefly for its early 1950s and 1960s reportage of township life under apartheid. History Drum was started in 1951, as African Drum by former test cricketer and author Bob Crisp and Jim Bailey an ex-R.A.F. pilot, son of South African financier Sir Abe Bailey. Initially under Crisp's editorship, the magazine had a paternalistic, tribal representation of Africans,\\"A history of Drum Magazine\\", South African History Online but within a short time Crisp was replaced and the emphasis moved to the vibrant urban black townships. The paper in its early years had a series of outstanding editors: * Anthony Sampson, 1951‚Äì55\\" Obituary, Anthony Sampson, 2004, The Guardian. * Sylvester Stein, 1955‚Äì58\\"Drum years\\" , www.sylvesterstein.com * Sir Tom Hopkinson, 1958‚Äì? Both Sampson and Stein wrote books about their times as editor, Drum: A Venture into the New Africa (1956, republished in 2005 as Drum: the making of a magazine)\\"Drum : The Making of a Magazine by Anthony Sampson\\". and Who Killed Mr Drum? (1999) respectively. Drum's heyday in the 1950s fell between the Defiance Campaign and the tragedy at Sharpeville. This was the decade of potential Black emergence, the decade when the Freedom Charter was written and the decade when the ANC alliance launched the Defiance Campaign. The aim was to promote an equal society. The Nationalist government responded with apartheid crackdowns and treason trials. It was also the decade of the movement to the cities, of Sophiatown, of Black jazz, the jazz opera King Kong with a Black cast, an adoption of American culture, of shebeens (illegal drinking dens) and flamboyant American style gangsters (tsotsis) with chrome-laden American cars who spoke a slang called Tsotsitaal. It was a time of optimism and hope. DRUM was a \\"record of naivety, optimism, frustration, defiance, courage, dancing, drink, jazz, gangsters, exile and death\\". DRUM described the world of the urban Black; the culture, the colour, dreams, ambitions, hopes and struggles. Lewis Nkosi described DRUM's young writers as \\"the new African[s] cut adrift from the tribal reserve ‚Äì urbanised, eager, fast-talking and brash.\\" Peter Magubane described the atmosphere in the newsroom. \\"DRUM was a different home; it did not have apartheid. There was no discrimination in the offices of DRUM magazine. It was only when you left DRUM and entered the world outside of the main door that you knew you were in apartheid land. But while you were inside DRUM magazine, everyone there was a family.\\" DRUM‚Ä≤s cast of black journalists included Henry (\\"Mr DRUM\\") Nxumalo, Can Themba, Todd Matshikiza, Nat Nakasa, Lewis Nkosi and others such as William \\"Bloke\\" Modisane, Arthur Maimane, Stan Motjuwadi and Casey Motsisi. Together, they were known as \\"the DRUM Boys\\". This group lived by the dictum \\"live fast, die young and have a good-looking corpse\\". Most of these journalists went on to publish works in their own right.Can Themba wrote The Suit and a selection of his output appears in The World of Can Themba, a selection of Nat Nakasa's output appears in The World of Nat Nakasa, Lewis Nkosi wrote Home and Exile and Mating Birds among others, Bloke Modisane wrote Blame Me on History , Arthur Maimane wrote Hate No More, and a selection of Casey Motsisi's output appears in Casey & Co . Refer to the individual entries for the ISBN numbers. The other journalists who worked there include Bessie Head,Almost all of Head's important work was written in Serowe, in particular, the three Serowe novels When Rain Clouds Gather, Maru, and A Question of Power. She also wrote short stories, including the collection The Collector of Treasures. Lionel Ngakane,Ngakane is most remembered for his 1966 short film Jemima and Johnny inspired by riots in Notting Hill. Richard Rive and Jenny Joseph.Joseph's best known poem, Warning, was written in 1961 and was included in her 1974 collection Rose in the Afternoon and in the Oxford Book of Twentieth Century English Verse. It was not only the writers‚Äìthe pictures were also important. The main photographer and artistic director was J√ºrgen Schadeberg, who arrived in South Africa in 1950 after leaving a war-ravaged Berlin. He became one of the rare European photographers to photograph the daily lives of Black people. He trained a generation of rising black photographers, including Ernest Cole, Bob Gosani and later Peter Magubane. Magubane joined DRUM because \\"they were dealing with social issues that affected black people in South Africa. I wanted to be part of that magazine\\". Alf Khumalo was another well-known photographer on the staff. Henry Nxumalo was the first journalist and specialised in investigative reporting. For example, he got a job on a potato farm where he exposed the exploitative conditions (almost slave-like) under which the Black labourers worked. In 1957, Nxumalo was murdered while investigating an abortion racket. His story was the basis for the 2004 film Drum.\\"DRUM (2004)\\", at IMDB. Todd Matshikiza wrote witty and informed jazz articles about the burgeoning township jazz scene. Dolly (the agony aunt) helped many a confused, young lover to get their lives back on course. The \\"Dear Dolly\\" letters were written by Dolly Rathebe, a popular actress, pin-up and singer. In reality, they were ghosted by other DRUM writers, notably Casey Motsisi. Arthur Maimane, under the pseudonym Arthur Mogale, wrote a regular series entitled \\"The Chief\\" where he described gangster incidents he had heard about in the shebeens. Don Mattera, a leading Sophiatown gangster, took exception to this. \\"The gangsters were pissed off with him and there was a word out that we should wipe this guy off.\\" The office telephonist, David Sibeko, became leader of the Pan-African Congress. DRUM also encouraged fiction. Es'kia Mphahlele (the fiction editor from 1955 to 1957) encouraged and guided this. During that time over 90 short stories were published by such authors as Todd Matshikiza, Bloke Modisane, Henry Nxumalo, Casey Motsisi, Arthur Maimane (alias Mogale), Lewis Nkosi, Nat Nakasa, Can Themba and others. These stories described the people of the street; jazz musicians, gangsters, shebeen queens and con men and were written in a uniquely Sophiatown-influenced blend of English and Tsotsitaal. This creative period has been called the Sophiatown renaissance. The backbone of the magazine was crime, investigative reporting, sex (especially if across the colour line) and sport. This was fleshed out by imaginative photography. The formula worked and made for compulsive reading. Each issue of DRUM was read by up to 9 people, passed from hand to hand on the streets, in the clubs or on the trains. It became a symbol of Black urban life. 240,000 copies were distributed each month across Africa. This was more than any other African magazine.

He was born in Oakland, California, the son of Karnic \\"Jack\\" Sahakian (July 27, 1907 ‚Äì November 5, 1945) and Evelyn L. Reese (April 3, 1914 ‚Äì December 2, 1973). His father was born in Armenia and his mother in Indiana. His father emigrated to the United States in 1914, joining his father, Dicran Sahakian (1867‚Äì1929), who emigrated to the U.S. in 1910. The family lived in Indianapolis, Indiana, where Dicran was a grocery retail merchant, before moving to California. Dicran, who became an Oriental rug importer, wanted his surname to be perpetuated in the land of liberty. After moving to Oakland, he died there October 30, 1929. He stipulated in his will that the first boy born to the eldest of his five sons was to receive approximately $2,500. In the event the eldest son had no male progeny, then the next eldest and on down to his youngest son would be eligible for the \\"premium\\" in the event he had a male child within five years. The chances of the youngest son, Karnic, winning the trust fund for his son seemed highly remote, but it came true. Jack Sahakian became the first born grandson and, when he was age 4-years-old in 1935, was awarded the money. His mother said she wanted to keep it intact for when he went to college. Sahakian became a hairdresser for the rich and famous in Los Angeles, and owned his own salon. He counts among the men speculated to be the inspiration for Warren Beatty's character in the movie Shampoo. He and his first wife, Ms. Oliva, had a son named Jack Anthony Sahakian (born March 16, 1952), who became an aerospace executive. He and Ms. Evanovic had a daughter, Linda Sahakian (born April 17, 1958). He met burlesque striptease artist Candy Barr when she was going with Mickey Cohen in 1959. She was appearing in Los Angeles while awaiting her appeal on a conviction and prison sentence in Texas for possession of marijuana. On November 25, 1959, Sahakian and Barr were married in Las Vegas, while she was appearing there. He kept her daughter when she entered prison. He became a character actor and made some guest appearances in top TV shows, playing the heavy in episodes of The Untouchables, Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Ben Casey. Being a hairdresser to the stars, such as Shirley MacLaine and Warren Beatty, this led to small roles in a couple movies, Billy Wilder's Irma la Douce starring Jack Lemmon and MacLaine for United Artists and Move Over, Darling starring Doris Day and James Garner for 20th Century Fox, both released in 1963. In the mid 1960s, Sahakian attended LIFE Bible College, which was beside the Angelus Temple founded by Aimee Semple McPherson. While there, he met his fourth wife, Barbara Ann Kerber, and they were married on March 5, 1967. They had one son, John Michael Sahakian (born December 15, 1967), who became a yoga teacher & stress management consultant. On February 5, 1968, Sahakian was a featured speaker at a Youth Rally at Melodyland, run by David Wilkerson, author of The Cross and the Switchblade. The ad in the L.A. Times for the \\"Great Teen Program\\" referred to Sahakian as \\"TV Personality And Former Drug Addict.\\" Sahakian also appeared in the made-for-TV movie Knuckle (1975), starring Eileen Brennan and Jack Cassidy. Jack Sahakian died at age 64 of liver disease at the Veterans Hospital in West Los Angeles. He is interred in Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery, Los Angeles, overlooking Burbank.

The player controls a young boy named Tarosuke as he must make his way through Jigoku, the Japanese concept of Hell, to reach Buddha, who will determine his fate. Tarosuke can fire small \\"ki\\" bullets at enemies to defeat them; he can also charge them to increase their power. Enemies will drop money when defeated, which can be used to purchase weapons and other items in stores. Gameplay Tarosuke jumping onto a cloud. To the top left is the player's score, health, and inventory, to the top right is the map and the player's current location. The player controls a boy named Tarosuke, who travels through \\"Jigoku\\" (the Japanese concept of Hell) fighting off \\"yokai\\" (mythical Japanese monsters) on his way to his final fate, as determined by Buddha. He destroys his enemies by firing small Ki bullets, which can be charged to increase their power; however, if overcharged, he is left unable to move or fight for a few seconds. During boss battles, Tarosuke kneels at a shrine to Buddha and prays, summoning \\"Monmotaro\\" (not to be confused with \\"Momotar≈ç\\"), a spirit which floats in the air and drops energy balls on the boss and any lackeys he has. Once the boss is defeated, Tarosuke goes to the next stage. Like Clovis from Dragon Buster, Taira no Kagekiyo from Genpei T≈çma Den, and Momo Chan from Wonder Momo, Tarosuke has a life bar (labeled as \\"POWER\\") but only one life; if the meter is empty, the game is over (unless he has a certain item). There are no scoring systems present, but the game utilizes currency (only referred to as \\"MONEY\\") which is used to buy items, among other things. There are five stages: Jigoku Iriguchi (Gateway to Hell), Kugyou no Michi (Path of Penance), Yuukai (Ghost Sea), Sabaki no Tani (Valley of Judgment) and Rinnekai (Land of Transmigration). There are multiple paths which can be taken in many stages, which may influence which of the five endings the player gets. One of the paths leads the player to a fairly racy dance hall show, after which he is given a box. If he opens the box, he might get 10,000 in money, or might be turned into an old man until he buys a particular item in a shop (this is based on the tale of Urashima Tar≈ç). There are five different endings depending on what Tarosuke did in the game; to get the last one, the player must not collect or kill anything for Stage 5. Release The game was later ported to the PC Engine, and Family Computer consoles (this version adds a \\"pious\\" counter) with several additions and different level design; the PC Engine version and the arcade version were both later re-released for the Japanese Virtual Console. The game was also followed by a Japan-only spin-off in 1990 named Ky≈´kai D≈çch≈´ki, which is a \\"yaky≈´\\" (baseball) video game that plays similar to the entirety of Namco's own World Stadium series. Tarosuke also appears as a playable character in the Japan- only role-playing PlayStation 2 game Namco X Capcom, where he is teamed up with Taira no Kagekiyo from Genpei T≈çma Den. He also makes a cameo appearance in Project X Zone 2 for the Nintendo 3DS. Reception Game Machine reported that Yokai Dokuchi was the most-popular arcade game in the month of April 1987.

They are currently members of the and play at the Recreation Ground. History The club was established in 1894 as Stanstead Abbots. They joined the East Herts League, later transferring to the Hertford & District League. In 1921 the club entered the North & East Division of the Hertfordshire Senior County League. In 1923 the league was reduced to a single division, and in 1925 it was disbanded. The club then returned to the district leagues, including the Waltham & District League, before rejoining the Hertfordshire Senior County League in 1947, becoming members of Division Two.

History Tring Athletic Youth FC were established in March 1958, when the founders contributed towards the purchase of of land at Miswell Lane.History Tring Athletic FC The club joined the West Herts Saturday League in the early 1960s, and despite only fielding players under-21, they won the Division One title three times in five years. Following a spell without success, the age limit was scrapped in 1971 and the club was renamed Tring Athletic. In the mid-1970s the ground was sold to the local council and the club were relegated to Division Three. However, by the mid-1980s they were back in the Premier Division. In 1988 the club joined Division One of the South Midlands League. They returned to Miswell Lane in 1992. After missing out on the Senior Division title in 1997‚Äì98 on goal difference, they won the league in 1999‚Äì00. In the same season they also won the Herts Charity Shield, the Herts Senior Centenary Trophy and the Cherry Red Books Trophy. Due to an inability to install floodlights at Miswell Lane, in 2003 the club absorbed Isthmian League neighbours Tring Town F.C. with an agreement to move to their Pendley ground, which already had floodlights. In 2003‚Äì04 they finished fourth in Division One and were promoted to the Premier Division.

Equations appear across and down in a crossword fashion and must be mathematically correct. It is similar to Scrabble except players use digits and mathematical operators instead of letters. About Equate can be beneficially used in both a classroom and as a board game for the family. To earn higher scores, a player must use division or fraction or land premium board positions. For 2 to 4 players or teams. It is recommended to be played by ages 8 and up. Benefits The use of fractions stimulates the players interest towards fractions and motives them to want to learn more about fractions. In order to get higher scores, players are constantly taking advantage of premium board positions. Equate uses large numbers. Single digits placed adjacent to one another creates even larger numbers. Equate is also strategically challenging for advanced players who are already good at math. The game adapts to many different levels of play.

They currently play in the . History=1921 to 1979 Founded in 1921, the club began by playing friendlies before being entering the Mid-Hertfordshire League (Division 2) for the 1922‚Äì23 season. The 1922-23 season was the club's first time in the FA Challenge Cup winning its first game 3‚Äì2 against Apsley in the Extra Preliminary Round before losing 3-1 to Leavesden Mental Hospital in the next round. In 1926 the club changed leagues to the Bedfordshire & District County League for one season. A year later they joined the Spartan League where they stayed until the end of the 1934‚Äì35 season. The 1926 season was the first time that the club entered in to the FA Amateur Cup. In the 1927‚Äì28 campaign the club won its first-ever silverware, winning the Hertfordshire FA Charity Shield, beating Hoddesdon Town 5‚Äì2. The club had a very successful 1934‚Äì35 season, where they reached its highest ever league position. However, Welwyn were forced to resign from the Spartan League as the club couldn't find a suitable ground on which to play. With problems collecting money with the and venue problems they had to wound up before the start of the 1935‚Äì36 season with debts of over ¬£20. In 1937 rivals Shredded Wheat FC had to be dissolved, this allowed Welwyn Garden City with a grant of ¬£50 to get re-establishment. They then entered the Spartan League for the 1937‚Äì38 season. Due to the Second World War the Spartan League was suspended, with the club only playing one league game and an FA Cup tie (that competition was also suspended). For the remainder of the 1939/40 season the club competed in the East, North & Mid-Hertfordshire Combination and then the Hertfordshire & Bedfordshire Combination. At a meeting held in August 1940 it was agreed \\"to carry on the club with the present committee\\". After the war the club return to competition in the 1944‚Äì45 season to compete in the Mid-Hertfordshire League. The 1945‚Äì46 season saw the club return to the Spartan League, where they remained until joining the London League for the 1950‚Äì51 season. Their brief stay in the London League lasted until 1955 during that time they enjoyed its best run in the FA Amateur Cup by reaching the 3rd Qualifying. The club rejoined the Spartan League in 1955, where they stayed until 1959. During this period the club was managed by former England goalkeeper international Harry Hibbs. The next stop was county football with a move to the Herts County League in 1959. In 1968 the club moved to its present home, Herns Way, with their first fixture at senior level against Knebworth in the Aubrey Cup, on 16 November that year. In 1970 the club joined the Greater London League and the following season was a founder member of the Metropolitan London League, where it remained for two seasons before joining the South Midlands League. In the 1972‚Äì73 season Welywn won the Premier Division championship at the first attempt under the guidance of former Scottish international Alex Massie. The following season they reached the final of the League Challenge Trophy, only to be beaten by Barton Rovers, 3‚Äì1 on aggregate. 1976‚Äì77 saw the club lose their top-flight status, and there began a five-year battle to reclaim it. During these First Division years the club was to finish no lower than 5th and in 1981‚Äì82, won the league and with it a return to the Premier Division. In the championship year the club also reached the final of the League Challenge Trophy, but once again had to settle for runners-up, this time losing 3‚Äì0 on aggregate to Stotfold. 1980s to 1999 In 1984‚Äì85 season under the guidance of John Sneddon as manager the club had success lifting the first ever Hertfordshire FA Senior Centenary Trophy beating Pirton 2‚Äì0. Sneddon decided to leave the club at the end of that season and former Sudbury Court manager Ray Sullivan took over the role. In the 1985‚Äì86 season Welwyn finished second in the table missing out on the title. In the 1986‚Äì87 and 1987‚Äì88 seasons the club lifted the Herts FA Charity Shield, making them only the sixth team to retain the Shield. The close of the 1986‚Äì87 season also saw floodlights installed at the Herns Way ground. The 1988‚Äì89 saw Welwyn finish in the top six of the league, with an appearance in two cup-finals, the League Challenge Trophy and the Hertfordshire FA Senior Centenary Trophy. However these were both lost in the space of five days. The 1990‚Äì91 season saw Ray Sullivan step down and so began a lean spell during which the Club tried several combinations, amongst those being Dave Lawrence, Jock Bruce, former player Pat Maslen and Ian Priest. During these years the closest the Club came to anything was another Hertfordshire FA Charity Shield final appearance, during Pat Maslen's reign. However, the trophy slipped through their fingers when losing out to Sawbridgeworth Town on penalties after a 2‚Äì2 draw. 1996‚Äì97 City looked to local man Malcolm Doctor, who the previous year had guided City's archrivals Hatfield Town to second place in the South Midlands League. Everyone at the Club was optimistic about further glory days returning to Herns Way. Two cup-finals were reached, the League Challenge Trophy and the Hertfordshire FA Charity Shield but again the Citizens missed out at the final stage. The 1997/98 season saw the formation of the Spartan South Midlands League, with the club joining the Premier Division North, finishing high enough (6th) to qualify for the Premier Division the following season. In 1998, upon the departure of Malcolm Doctor, the Citizens forged a link with near neighbours, Stevenage Borough FC and strengthened their squad with Boro's EFCO youngsters along with the management pairing of Dave Bullock and Bill Bannister. However, despite reaching the Third Qualifying Round of the FA Cup for the first time the season collapsed midway through and with the break-up of the squad and a battle with relegation followed. 1999 to present 1999‚Äì00 saw a rebuilding process with former Somersett Ambury V&E; boss Dave Steadman being appointed and given the task of leading the Citizens into the new millennium. However, the club's downward trend continued and in 2001‚Äì02 the club was relegated into the First Division thus ending one of the longest unbroken spells in the Premier Division. Guillermo Ganet was appointed manager in 2002 with the task of restoring the glory days back to the club and following two seasons steered the club back to the Premier Division. The club's first season back saw them finish in a very creditable third place, however, the end of the campaign saw the manager and most of the playing squad depart for Berkhamsted Town. Howard Cowley was given his chance as manager in 2005‚Äì06; he brought about a wealth of experience from not only the South Midlands League but in all divisions of the Isthmian League. During his tenure the club had an excellent 19 game unbeaten run in all competitions and also equalled their best ever FA Cup run when losing narrowly away 2‚Äì1 to the then Conference South leaders Histon in the 3rd Qualifying Round. The club also exceeded its best-ever run in the FA Vase by reaching the 5th Round only for an administrative error to deny them the chance to go even further. Players Joe Devera, Nick Brindley and Harry Hunt were offered contracts with Barnet FC and the season's top scorer, Bradley Woods-Garness, went to Conference side Farnborough Town. 2006‚Äì07 saw the club achieve fourth spot in the league, becoming the only side to beat eventual League and Cup champions Edgware Town at their White Lion ground whilst doing the double over local rivals Hertford Town with two fine victories. Following the departure of Howard Cowley, a succession of managers tried to revive the fortunes of the club however this quick turnover of managers did nothing to ensure success, in fact, it had the opposite effect with relegation back to the First Division at the end of the 2009‚Äì10 campaign. A feature of that season was the 'A' Team winning the North & Mid-Hertfordshire league, managed by Simon Braine. 2010‚Äì11 saw the club's poor form continue. This was not helped by having three managers in the season, Phil Read, Rob Pattwell and Simon Braine. The latter, with the help of Assistant Manager Adam Fisher, helped to steer the club away from potentially ruinous relegation. 2011‚Äì12 saw Simon working alongside Charlie Marshall although the partnership was to last just twelve months. The following season the club then turned to former players Scott O'Donoghue and Pablo Ardiles to try and take the Citizens back into the top flight. Scott and Pablo left the club after one season in charge. In 2013‚Äì14 Welwyn Garden City found their feet again under newly appointed Manager Adam Fisher, with a respectable league campaign, finishing 4th. 2014‚Äì15 saw the Citizens shine, with impressive runs in the FA Cup and FA Vase. A feature of the season was Jason Caswell's 51 goals, a new club record, on the way to the club's first ever cup and league 'Double' of the First Division Championship and Division 1 Cup. Promotion was achieved for the first time in five years with a season record of W29 D5 L6. The 2015/16 season saw the club winning the League Challenge Trophy for the first time. They also lost in the final of the Dudley Latham Memorial (Premier Division) Cup. The following season was one of consolidation on and off the pitch as extensive ground improvements were completed. On 12 November 2017 Tottenham Hotspur Ambassador Ossie Ardiles unveiled stadium upgrades after the club had received funds from a Premier League grant. The club built two new spectator stands and also received donated turnstiles from the old White Hart Lane. The 2017‚Äì18 season saw the club win the Spartan South Midlands Premier League and with it promotion. Even the disappointment of two more cup final defeats, the Hertfordshire FA Charity Shield and the Dudley Latham Memorial (Premier Division) Cup couldn't overshadow Adam Fisher's team's achievement.

In the 12th Century Richard I held his Midland Parliaments in Pipewell. Pipewell was the site of a Cistercian abbey established in 1143 by William Butevilain, and all of the settlement is built around three fields where this used to be, which contains the Harpers Brook, a tributary of the River Nene, running through the centre.Cistercian Abbeys: Pipewell. The Cistercians in Yorkshire. Retrieved 7 December 2009 It was located within the old Rockingham Forest and some of its income came from sale of the timber and undergrowth. The abbey was suppressed as part of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in November 1538, despite the representations of local gentleman, especially Sir William Parr (later Marquess of Northampton). The site was subsequently granted to Parr. He intended to demolish the house, but before he could do so the property was looted by the locals. Demolition took place soon after and by 1720 no standing masonry was visible. Pipewall Hall, a Grade II mansion, was built in 1675 with some of the stone from the former abbey: the abbey remains are contained in its estate. West of the site, there is a mill pond and dam, together with a series of medieval quarries which have been worked into the twentieth century.

It is also the first Charter decision to reach the Supreme Court since its enactment in 1982. Background  Joel Skapinker was a citizen of South Africa residing in Canada who applied to the Ontario bar to practice law. The bar refused his application as the Law Society Act required that he be a Canadian citizen. Skapinker has brought an application to have the provision of the Act requiring Canadian citizenship be held inoperative on the basis that it violated section 6(2)(b) of the Charter. At trial, the application was denied. However, on appeal the Court held that his mobility rights were in fact violated. Opinion of the Court The unanimous Court held that Skapinker's rights were not violated by the Law Society Act. Estey J., writing for the Court, acknowledged the difficulty in interpreting the Charter as it was not to be treated like a statute. He examined the headings of each section and tried to reconcile them with the wording of the sections. He noted several factors that must be considered: *the degree of difficulty because of ambiguity or obscurity in construing the section; * the length and complexity of the provision; * the apparent homogeneity of the provision appearing under the heading; the use of generic terminology in the heading; * the presence or absence of a system of headings which appear to segregate the component elements of the Charter; * and the relationship of the terminology employed in the heading to the substance of the headlined provision. In the end Estey finds that section 6 \\"does not establish a separate and distinct right to work divorced from the mobility provisions in which it is found. The two rights (in para. (a) and in para. (b)) both relate to movement into another province, either for the taking up of residence, or to work without establishing residence.\\" Consequently, the appeal was overturned. Estey, however, added that his interpretation has been intentionally cautious due to the newness of the Charter and that there may warrant further expansion of the right in the future.

FireWire is Apple Computer's trademark for the IEEE 1394 standard. FireWire cameras are available in the form of photo cameras and video cameras, which provide image and audio data. A special form of video cameras is used in the domains of industry, medicine, astronomy, microscopy and science. These special cameras do not provide audio data. Different forms of FireWire cameras Structure The basic structure of FireWire cameras is based on the following six modules: Optics The structure of FireWire cameras FireWire cameras are based on CCD or CMOS chips. The light sensitive area, as well as the pixels of these chips are small. In the case of cameras with integrated optics we can assume that the optics is adapted to these chips. However, in the domains of professional and semi-professional photography, as well as in the domain of special cameras, interchangeable optics are often used. In these cases, a system specialist has to adapt the optics and the chip to the application (see System integration). Besides normal lenses, such interchangeable lenses may be microscopes, endoscopes, telescopes, etc. With the exception of the standard C-mount and CS-mount, the mounts of interchangeable optics are company-specific. Signal capture Since the function of a FireWire camera depends upon electrical signals, the module \\"signal capture\\" transforms the incident light, as well as the incident sound into electrons. In the case of light, this process is performed by a CCD or CMOS chip. The transformation of the sound is performed by a microphone. Digitization The first step of the image's digitization results from the structure of a CCD or CMOS chip. It dissects the image into pixels. If a pixel has collected many photons, it creates a high voltage. Should there only be a few photons, a low voltage is created. \\"Voltage\\" is an analog value. Therefore, during the digitization's second step, the voltage has to be transformed into a digital value by an A/D converter. Now the raw digital image is available. A microphone transforms the sound into a voltage. An A/D converter transforms these analog values into digital ones. Signal enhancement The creation of color is based on a color filter, which is located in front of the CCD or CMOS chip. It is red, green or blue and changes its color from pixel to pixel. Therefore, the filter is called a color filter array or, after its inventor, Bayer filter. Using these raw digital images, the module \\"signal enhancement\\" creates an image, which meets aesthetic requirements. The same is true for the audio data. In the final step, the module compresses the image and audio data and outputs them - in the case of video cameras - as a DV data stream. In the case of photo cameras, single images may be output and, if applicable, voice comments as files. The application domains of industry, medicine, astronomy, microscopy and science often use special monochrome cameras. They forgo any signal enhancement and thus output the digital image data in its raw state. Some special models of color camera are only capable of outputting raw digital image data. Such cameras are called ColorRAW or Bayer cameras. They are often used in industry, medicine, astronomy, microscopy and science. In form of photo cameras, they are used by professional photographers. Semi-professional photo cameras often offer an optional RAW mode. The enhancement of the raw digital data takes place outside the camera on a computer and therefore the user is able to adapt it to a particular application. Interface The first three modules are part of any digital camera. The interface is the module that characterizes the FireWire camera. It is based on the IEEE 1394 standard, defined by the organization \\"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\\". This standard defines a bus, which transmits: # time critical data, for example a video and # data whose integrity is of critical importance (for example, parameters or files). It allows the simultaneous use of up to 63 different devices (cameras, scanners, video recorders, hard disks, DVD drives, etc.). Other standards, called \\"protocols\\" define the behavior of these devices. FireWire cameras mostly use one of the following protocols: ; AV/C : AV/C stands for \\"Audio Video Control\\" and defines the behavior of DV devices, for example, video cameras and video recorders. It is a standard, defined by the 1394 Trade Association. The Audio/Video Working Group is in charge of it. ; DCAM : DCAM stands for \\"1394-based Digital Camera Specification\\" and defines the behavior of cameras that output uncompressed image data without audio. It is a standard, defined by the 1394 Trade Association. The IIDC (Instrumentation and Industrial Control Working Group) is in charge of it. ; IIDC : IIDC is often used synonymously with DCAM. ; SBP-2 : SBP-2 stands for \\"Serial Bus Protocol\\" and defines the behavior of mass storage devices, such as hard disks. It is an ANSI standard maintained by NCITS. Devices that use the same protocol are able to communicate with each other. A typical example is the connection of a video camera and a video recorder. Thus, in contrast to the USB bus, there is no need to use a controlling computer. If a computer is used, it has to be compatible with the protocols of the device with which it is to communicate (please cf. Exchanging data with computers). Control The controlling module coordinates the other ones. The user may specify its behavior by: # switches outside the camera, # the FireWire bus, using application software or # a hybrid of the first two cases. Photo cameras Professional and semi-professional photo cameras, and especially digital camera backs, offer FireWire interfaces to transfer image data and to control the camera. The image data's transfer is based on the protocol SBP-2. In this mode, the camera behaves as an external hard disk and thus enables the simple exchange of image files with a computer (please cf. Exchanging data with computers). To increase the work efficiency in a photo studio, additionally photo cameras and digital backs are controllable via the FireWire bus. Usually the camera manufacturer does not publish the protocol used in this mode. Therefore, camera control requires a specialized piece of software provided by the camera manufacturer, which mostly is available for Macintosh and Windows computers. Video cameras Although compatibility to the FireWire bus is only found in high-end photo cameras, it has usually been present in home-user level video cameras. Video cameras are mostly based on the protocol AV/C. It defines the flow of audio and video data, as well as the camera's control signals. The majority of video cameras only provides the output of audio and video data via the FireWire bus (\\"DVout\\"). Additionally, some video cameras are able to record audio and video data (\\"DVout/DVin\\"). Video cameras exchange their data with computers and/or video recorders. Special cameras In the domains of industry, medicine, astronomy, microscopy and science FireWire cameras are often used not for aesthetic, but rather for analytical purposes. They output uncompressed image data, without audio. These cameras are based on the protocol DCAM (IIDC) or on company specific protocols. Due to their field of application, their behavior is considerably different from photo cameras or video cameras: # Their case is small and built mainly from metal and do not follow aesthetic, but rather functional design constraints. # The vast majority of special cameras does not offer integrated optics, but a standardized lens mount called \\"C-mount\\" or \\"CS-mount\\". This standard is not only used by lenses, but also by microscopes, telescopes, endoscopes and other optical devices. # Recording aids, such as autofocus or image stabilization are not available. # Special cameras often utilize monochrome CCD or CMOS chips. # Special cameras often do not apply an infrared cut filter or optical low pass filters, thus avoid affecting the image. # Special cameras output image data streams and single images, which are captured using an external trigger signal. In this way, these cameras can be integrated into industrial processes. # Mass storage devices are not available since the images have to be analyzed more or less immediately by the computer connected to the camera. # The vast majority of special cameras is controlled by application software, installed on a computer. Therefore, the cameras do not have external switches. # Application software is rarely available off-the-shelf. It usually has to be adapted to the specific application. Therefore, camera manufacturers offer programming tools designed for their cameras. If a camera uses the standard protocol DCAM (IIDC), it can also be used with third party software. A lot of industrial computers and embedded systems are compatible to the DCAM (IIDC) protocol (please cf. Structure / Interface and Exchanging data with computers). In comparison to photo or video cameras, these special cameras are very simple. However, it makes no sense to use them in an isolated manner. They are, as other sensors, only components of a bigger system (please cf. System integration). Exchanging data with computers FireWire cameras are able to exchange data with any other FireWire device, as long as both devices use the same protocol (please cf. Structure / Interface). Depending upon the specific camera, these data are: * Image and audio files (protocol: SBP-2) * Image and audio data flows (protocol: AV/C or DCAM (IIDC)) * Parameters to control the camera (protocol: AV/C or DCAM (IIDC)) Data exchange between FireWire cameras and computers Left: company specific system Right: open system If the camera is to communicate with a computer, this computer has to have a FireWire interface and to use the camera's protocol. The old days of FireWire cameras were dominated by company specific solutions. Some specialist offered interface boards and drivers, which were accessible only by their application software. Following this approach, application software is in charge of the protocol. Since this solution utilizes the computing resources in a very efficient manner, it is still used in the context of highly specialized, industrial projects. This strategy often leads to problems, using other FireWire devices, as for instance hard disks. Open systems avoid this disadvantage. Open systems are based on a layer model. The behavior of the single layers (interface board, low level driver, high level driver and API) follows the constraints of the respective operating system manufacturer. Application software is allowed to access operating system APIs, but never should access any level lower. In the context of FireWire cameras, the high level drivers are responsible for the protocol. The low level drivers and the interface boards put the definitions of the standard IEEE 1394 into effect. The advantage of this strategy is the simple realization of application software, which is independent of hardware and specific manufacturers. Especially in the domains of photo cameras and special cameras hybrids between open and company specific systems are used. The interface boards and the low level drivers typically adhere to the standard, while the levels above are company specific. The basic characteristic of open systems is not to use the APIs of the hardware manufacturers, but those of the operating system. For Apple and Microsoft the subject \\"image and sound\\" is of high importance. According to their APIs - QuickTime and DirectX - are very well known. However, in the public perception they are reduced to the reproduction of audio and video. Actually, they are powerful APIs that are also responsible for image acquisition. Under Linux this API is called video4linux. It is less powerful than QuickTime and DirectX and therefore additional APIs exist besides video4linux: Accessing FireWire cameras under Linux ; Photo cameras : Photo cameras usually use Linux' infrastructure for mass storage devices. One of the typical applications is digiKam. ; Video cameras : Video cameras are accessed by various APIs. The image to the right depicts the access of the video editing software Kino to the libavc1394 API. Kino also accesses other APIs which are not shown in the image to simplify matters. ; Special cameras : The most important API for special cameras is libdc1394. The image to the right depicts the access of the application software Coriander to this API. Coriander controls FireWire cameras that are based on the protocol DCAM (IIDC) and acquires their images. In order to simplify the use of video4linux and the dedicated APIs, the meta API unicap has been developed. It covers their bits and pieces with the aid of a simple programming model. System integration Often FireWire cameras are only a cog in a bigger system. Typically, a system specialist uses a number of different components to solve a particular problem. There are two basic approaches to do this: # The problem at hand is interesting enough for a group of users. The typical indicator of this situation is the off-the-shelf availability of application software. Studio photography is an example. # The problem at hand is only of interest to a particular application. In such cases, there is typically no application software available off-the-shelf. Therefore, it has to be written by a system specialist. The gauging of a steel plate is an example. Many aspects of system integration are not directly related to FireWire cameras. For example, illumination has a very strong influence on the quality of the acquired images. This holds true for both aesthetic and analytical applications. However, in the context of the realization of application software, there is a special feature, which is typical for FireWire cameras. It is the availability of standardized protocols, such as AV/C, DCAM, IIDC and SBP-2 (please cf. Structure / Interface and Exchanging data with computers). Using these protocols, the software is written independently from any particular camera and manufacturer. By leaving the realization of the protocol to the operating system, and by enabling access to a set of APIs, software can be developed independently from hardware. If, for instance, under Linux a piece of application software uses the API libdc1394 (please cf. Exchanging data with computers), it can access all FireWire cameras that use the protocol DCAM (IIDC). Using the API unicap additionally permits access to other video sources, such as frame grabbers.

The seventh named storm and fourth hurricane of the 2000 Atlantic hurricane season, Gordon developed in the extreme western Caribbean Sea from a tropical wave on September 14\\\\. Shortly thereafter, the depression moved inland over the Yucat√°n Peninsula and later emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on September 15\\\\. The depression began to quickly organize, and by early on September 16, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gordon. After becoming a tropical storm, Gordon continued to intensify and was reclassified as a hurricane about 24 hours later; eventually, the storm peaked as an 80 mph (130 km/h) Category 1 hurricane. However, southwesterly upper-level winds caused Gordon to weaken as it approached land, and it was downgraded to a tropical storm by late on September 17\\\\. At 0300 UTC on September 18, Gordon made landfall near Cedar Key, Florida as a strong tropical storm. After moving inland, Gordon rapidly weakened and had deteriorated to tropical depression status by nine hours later. Later that day, Gordon merged with a frontal boundary while centered over Georgia. Prior to becoming a tropical cyclone, the precursor tropical wave caused severe flooding in Guatemala, killing 23 people. While crossing the Yucat√°n Peninsula, the storm dropped heavy rainfall, with a few areas experiencing more than of precipitation. Similarly, portions of western Cuba reported rainfall totals reaching . Gordon brought moderate storm surge to the west coast of Florida; one person drowned due to rough seas. Numerous trees and power lines sustained damage, which left 120,000 people without electricity. In the Tampa Bay area and Cedar Key, minor roof damage to houses and street flooding occurred. In addition, two tornadoes caused some damage in Cape Coral and Ponce Inlet. Elsewhere, affects were minimal, though two indirect fatalities occurred in North Carolina, and minor flooding was reported in South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York. Overall, Gordon caused $10.8 million (2000 USD) in damage and 26 fatalities. Meteorological history A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on September 4 and tracked westward across the Atlantic Ocean without strengthening. On September 9 and 10, the tropical wave moved through the Lesser Antilles bringing local heavy rainfall and wind gusts reaching 35 mph (55 km/h). The wave then moved west-northwest and developed a well-defined center on September 12 in the central Caribbean Sea. Satellite photos on September 13 indicated that the convective pattern in the system was disorganized. However, later that day, a broad low pressure area had developed along axis of the wave, based on surface observations about southeast of Cozumel, Mexico. Early on September 14, it was estimated from satellite imagery that the low pressure system was near tropical depression strength, even though the convection was still disorganized. Tropical Storm Gordon as seen by radar over the Southeastern United States The system was classified as Tropical Depression Eleven at 1200 UTC on September 14, based on reports from reconnaissance aircraft. Later that day, the developing depression moved inland over the Yucat√°n Peninsula. The depression moved slowly to the northwest without emerging over water, therefore, the depression did not gain intensity. At this time, the predicted track for the system was highly uncertain due to different computer models forecasting different tracks. The official forecast predicted a northwestward movement into the western Gulf of Mexico, but some models predicted the low to move towards northwestern Florida, while another model predicted the low to move southwards into the Bay of Campeche. Late on September 15, the depression moved off the north coast of the Yucat√°n Peninsula and into the Gulf of Mexico, where it showed signs of better organization. The future track was still very uncertain, though a few computer models forecasted for the depression to move northeastwards towards Florida, resulting in an eastward shift on official forecast. Early on September 16, data from Hurricane Hunter aircraft indicated that the storm had strengthened to about 60 mph (95 km/h) at the surface, and the barometric pressure had fallen to . Therefore, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Gordon at 0000 UTC. Upon being a tropical storm on September 16, Gordon was moving northeastward towards the Big Bend of Florida, continuing to slowly intensify. The official forecast track was shifted further east, forecasting Gordon to track to the northeast. Early on September 17, a ship reported winds of 75 mph (120 km/h), indicating that Gordon had attained hurricane strength. Gordon reached a peak intensity of 80 mph (130 km/h), six hours later while located about southwest of Tampa, Florida. Later that day, Gordon began to weaken due to entrainment from the south and increasing vertical wind shear. Gordon was downgraded to a tropical storm as it neared the Florida coast. The storm made landfall just northwest of Cedar Key, Florida, at 0300 UTC on September 18 with winds of 60 mph (95 mph). After moving inland, interaction with the land and cool, dry air further weakened the storm. Gordon weakened to a tropical depression nine hours after landfall, and six hours later, it had merged with a frontal system over southeastern Georgia. The storm also transitioned into an extratropical cyclone, as it moved to the northeast. On September 21, the system merged with a large extratropical system over eastern Canada. Preparations=Florida Residents in Florida loaded up supplies on September 16 when the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch along Florida's west coast from Bonita Beach to the Suwannee River. The hurricane watch extended northward and westward later in the day to Apalachicola. Hurricane warnings were initiated on September 17 for areas along the Florida coast from Anna Maria Island to Ochlockonee River. Tropical storm warnings were issued south of Anna Maria Island to Bonita Beach and west of Ochlockonee River to Indian Pass. Tropical storm warnings were also issued along the east coast of the United States from Titusville in Florida to Little River Inlet in South Carolina. The Florida Division of Emergency Management in Tallahassee issued a mandatory evacuation in Hernando County, while voluntary evacuations were called for some of the coastal areas along Florida's west coast. Anticipating that Gordon will make landfall and move inland, two tornado watches were in effect from Sarasota to Naples, and tornado warnings were issued from Orlando to Vero Beach. Flash flood warnings were also in effect in parts of Florida. On September 17, Governor of Florida Jeb Bush activated emergency response teams. In various areas of Florida, spokesmen for the Emergency Operations Center advised residents to prepare for the storm and monitor the track of the approaching hurricane. At Cape Canaveral, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) also took precautions against the hurricane, as the storm could force NASA to move Space Shuttle Discovery off its launch pad at the seaside and into the hangar. Many evacuations took place once Gordon crossed the Florida coast. The Emergency Operations Center in Florida said authorities had arranged mandatory evacuations for coastal regions in the Citrus, Franklin, Hernando, Levy and Taylor counties, while also recommending voluntary evacuations for numerous other counties. The Red Cross reported that the storm forced 500 people to seek refuge in shelters. Also, many flights were canceled at the Tampa International Airport. About 200 National Guardsmen were called to help clean up the damage in flooded areas. Officials forced schools in six counties - Gilchrist, Columbia, Citrus, Taylor, Lafayette and Suwannee to close down for one day. Gulf of Mexico Chevron Corporation and Shell Oil Company evacuated offshore crews from the Gulf of Mexico on September 16 in preparation for a possible hurricane threat from Hurricane Gordon, even though there was little effect on oil and gas production before that day. The Chevron Corporation expected the number of people working in the Gulf to reduce from 1,700 on September 16 to 450 the next day. Gordon also forced the cruise liner Carnival Sensation, consisting of 2,200 passengers and 900 crew members, to remain at sea for one day. Residents in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana were also advised by radio to keep track of the approaching hurricane. Impact=Latin America As a tropical wave, Gordon killed 23 people in Guatemala mainly due to flooding and landslides in mountainous regions. While drifting over the Yucat√°n Peninsula of Mexico, Gordon dropped heavy rainfall peaking at 9 inches (230 mm) in Canc√∫n. The storm also dumped heavy rainfall in western Cuba with totals reaching . However, no flooding was reported in either the Yucat√°n Peninsula or Cuba. United StatesFlorida= Total rainfall from Gordon Before Gordon made landfall in Florida, one death occurred when a surfer drowned in the raging seas offshore Pensacola. Other than that, minimal effects occurred to the west of the storm's path. Light rainfall was reported, with in Tallahassee and in Cross City recorded. Lying near in the path of the storm, rainfall from the Gordon in the United States peaked at in Mayo. Winds in the region were also light, with a sustained wind speed of and gusts to reported in Cross City. In Perry, sustained winds reached and gusts of occurred. At the C-MAN Station in nearby Keaton Beach, a wind gust of was reported. Although the storm made landfall near Cedar Key, no wind observations were taken there, though the offshore Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) Station reported winds of and gusts to . Tides were also light, reaching in Cedar Key. Similarly, precipitation was also light, with of rain reported at Cedar Key. Minor roof and tree damage occurred in Levy County, totaling to about $100,000. In Citrus County, winds downed a few trees, powerlines, and tree branches between Sulpher Springs and Ozello, though damage was less than $25,000. Ten homes were flooded and a few trees and powerlines were downed, resulting in about $100,000 in losses. Roofs were damaged at 15 villas in Pasco County, while falling trees struck vehicles parked at a subdivision in New Port Richey; damage in that county totaled to $250,000. Winds and minor floods damaged 51 single-family homes, 32 mobile homes, 27 multi-family homes, and 24 businesses in Pinellas County, resulting in nearly $500,000 in losses. In addition, nearly of water inundated coastal roads between St. Pete Beach and Clearwater. Two locations reported sustained tropical storm force winds in St. Petersburg. Due to high tides, a large portion of the west coast of Florida from Pinellas County southward experienced coastal flooding. On September 17, of water covered Bayshore Boulevard near downtown Tampa. The Courtney Campbell Causeway, which connects Clearwater and Tampa, was closed for almost four hours due to storm surge flooding. 40 houses in low-lying areas between Ruskin and Riverview were damaged by flooding from the storm surge. Several other houses in Hillsborough County were damaged by toppled trees and large falling branches. Winds throughout the state of Florida left 120,000 people without electricity, mostly in the Tampa metropolitan area. Overall, damage in Hillsborough County totaled to nearly $500,000. Further south in Manatee County, storm surge and high tides flooded 25 homes and businesses in Bradenton Beach. wind gusts in Coquina Beach toppled lifeguard towers and destroyed an anemometer. Several homes in Anna Maria suffered light to moderate roof damage due to winds. Losses in Manatee County reached almost $500,000. In Sarasota County, waves ripped a section and three concrete pilings off the Venice Municipal Fishing Pier, resulting in nearly $600,000 in damage. Between of water covered coastal roads on Siesta and Casey Keys. Minor beach erosion occurred in Charlotte County and a sustained wind speed of was reported in Punta Gorda. Despite effects in adjacent counties, there was minimal damage in Charlotte County. In Lee County, tropical storm force winds damaged roofs, awnings, and lanais at nine homes; winds also toppled several large trees and branches, and downed power lines across Cape Coral and Fort Myers. A tornado rated F1 on the Fujita scale touched down near Sanibel. It caused extensive damage to two condominium complexes, and 24 nearby homes. Further along its path, the tornado damaged a few other homes and carports, while also toppling or spanning palm trees. Gordon also spawned two tornadoes that touched down as it made landfall. One tornado touched down near Cape Coral, Florida, damaging three homes, while an F0 tornado touched down near Ponce Inlet in Volusia County, Florida, causing minimal damage, mainly to trees and roofs. In Citrus and Levy Counties, residents who were evacuated on the day when Gordon struck the coast were allowed early the next day to return to their homes after the storm passed. =Georgia, The Carolinas, and Virginia= Despite the rain, Gordon did little to relieve an ongoing drought in Georgia. The remnants of Tropical Storm Gordon brought heavy rainfall to South Carolina, with spotter reports and radar estimates indicating over in Georgetown. Numerous streets were reported flooded by emergency managers, while according to newspaper accounts, there was standing water of more than in depth in many areas. Many motorists were forced to abandon their cars, several of which sustained water damage. Numerous homes were flooded in the town, especially on Hawkins Street. Additionally, many businesses were forced to close for the day along Front and Fraser Streets. One injury was reported when a policeman had a heart attack after the flood waters entered his home. In Charleston County, of rain fell. Flooding occurred in the northeastern portions of the county, in combination with more than of precipitation that had fallen less than two weeks earlier. Water entered homes and businesses in the McClellanville area and inundated a portion of U.S. Route 17, causing that section to be closed for most of the day on September 18\\\\. Sustained winds of and gusts up to in Charleston downed a few trees in coastal areas. Flooding in North Carolina occurred as the storm moved up the East Coast of the United States, indirectly killing two people when a car lost control and struck a tractor trailer during the storm. Two men in a fishing boat were also reported missing. Rainfall in North Carolina peaked at in Hoffman Forest. The remnants of Gordon moved across the Virginia on September 19\\\\. Rainfall totals throughout the state peaked at in Rocky Branch. The daily rainfall was broken at Washington Dulles International Airport after of rain fell. Isaac Creek overflowed its banks near Cross Junction, flooding Route 689. Happy Creek overflowed its banks in Front Royal and flooded Eighth Street. Across Warren County, Ritenour Hollow Road and Oregon Hollow Road were closed by high water. High water was reported on U.S. Route 11 south of Woodstock. =Mid-Atlantic and West Virginia= By September 19, the remnants of Gordon reached Maryland. In Carroll County, 4 hour rainfall amounts include in Westminster, at Piney Run Park, and Manchester. As a result, a few roads in the county were closed due to water inundation. In other areas, similar precipitation totals were reported, including near Columbia, in Emmitsburg, in Sharpsburg, in Laurel, at Brighton Dam, in Ellicott City and Hagerstown, in Frederick, and in Lisbon. Doppler radar estimates indicate that around of rain fell in only 3 hours in portions of Cecil, Kent, Queen Anne's County, resulting in minor flooding in poor drainage or low-lying areas. In Delaware, precipitation totals at Newark and New Castle Airport both reached . This resulted in minor flooding along the Christina River in New Castle County and nearby low-lying areas. In West Virginia, the storm produced locally heavy rainfall in the Eastern Panhandle, peaking at in Berkeley County. The remnants of Gordon dropped heavy rain across southeast Pennsylvania on September 19, resulting in flooding in low-lying areas. The heaviest rain fell near Willow Grove NAS, located in Horsham Township, Montgomery County. In Bucks County, stream flooding was reported in the Little Neshaminy Creek Basin in Warrington and Warminster Townships. The Pennypack Creek overflowed in Montgomery County and damaged parked cars at an elementary school in Hatboro. Flood waters also entered several rooms of the Old Mill Inn. In Horsham Township, homes on County Line Road were flooded, including one that had of water in its garage. Storm totals included at the Willow Grove NAS, in Southampton, at King of Prussia, in Reading, at Northeast Philadelphia Airport, at Neshaminy Falls, in Exton, and in Furlong. Heavy precipitation fell in west central and southwest New Jersey, causing poor drainage flooding in low-lying areas. The heaviest rain fell in Mercer County and caused some minor flooding along the Assunpink Creek. Roadway flooding along U.S. Route 130 was reported in Collingswood. Rainfall totals included in Trenton, in Pennsauken, in Somerdale and Windsor, in Mount Laurel, and in Mount Holly. Rainfall in Orange County, New York of caused minor stream flooding, such as along New York State Route 132 in Woodbury.

Early life and college Schlereth was born and grew up in Anchorage, Alaska, and struggled with dyslexia as a youth ‚Äî he did not learn to read until he was seven.Mike and Mike in the Morning, ESPN, air date January 11, 2007. He graduated from Robert Service High School in 1984. Growing up in Alaska, Schlereth did not receive much attention as a college football prospect; the only current FBS schools that offered him a scholarship were Idaho (I-AA at the time) and Hawaii. He accepted the scholarship offer from the University of Idaho from head coach Dennis Erickson. Erickson departed following the 1985 season, and Schlereth started at left guard on the Vandals' offensive line for new head coach Keith Gilbertson, blocking for quarterbacks Scott Linehan and John Friesz. In his senior season in 1988, the Vandals advanced to the national semifinals, and he was second team Schlereth was inducted into the University of Idaho Vandal Athletics Hall of Fame in 2008. Professional career Schlereth was selected in the tenth round (#263 overall) of the 1989 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins. He played 12 NFL seasons‚Äîsix with the Denver Broncos (1995‚Äì2000). He was a member of three Super Bowl championship teams (one with the Redskins and two with the Broncos) and was selected to the Pro Bowl for his performances in the 1991 and 1998 seasons. On January 25, 1998 Schlereth celebrated his 32nd birthday on the same day he helped the Broncos win Super Bowl XXXII, a 31‚Äì24 victory over the Green Bay Packers. Before ending his playing career, Schlereth endured 29 surgeries. Twenty of those surgeries were performed on his knees (15 left, five right). After the 13th procedure on his left knee on July 24, 2000, Denver Broncos head coach Mike Shanahan stated, \\"He has a great pain threshold. I think the doctors said that it was the worst knee that they've ever seen.\\" Schlereth would have two more procedures on his left knee during the 2000 season, his last in the NFL. His injuries are documented on Athlete 360, the sports medicine television show hosted by Schlereth's former Redskins teammate, Dr. Mark Adickes. On April 18, 2001, Schlereth announced his retirement. \\"The reason I came out here today was to announce that I have just signed a six-year, $42 million contract to extend my career with the Denver Broncos. The truth of the matter is, after going through my 15th operation on my left knee last November, it became painfully obvious that I couldn't sign a six-year contract for $42 worth of Tupperware. I started to realize in the last three months of free agency that there is not a lot of market for a , guard that is 35 years old and beat to a pulp.\\" He landed a job with ESPN soon after. Television/Radio career After retirement, Schlereth hosted an afternoon sports talk radio show on Denver AM radio 760 The Zone with fellow former Broncos lineman David \\"Doc\\" Diaz-Infante. The show was frequently referred to as the \\"Stink and Doc\\" show. Schlereth was a part-time analyst with ESPN for a time, commuting from Denver to Connecticut, before leaving 760 to go full-time with ESPN in 2004. He was an analyst on NFL Live (2004‚Äì2017) and SportsCenter. Since 2017, Schlereth has been a color commentator for NFL games broadcast on Fox NFL, paired with Adam Amin on the #3 team. He also co- hosts a radio show in Denver on Sports Radio 104.3 The Fan, and appears as an analyst on FS1 television programming. He was a frequent guest and fill-in host for Mike Golic on Mike and Mike in the Morning. He has also filled in for Jim Rome on Jim Rome is Burning. Schlereth revealed on the Mike and Mike in the Morning show that he was considering a career in acting, mainly on soap operas, under the name Roc Hoover. Schlereth originally chose the name Rock Hoover, however after cybersquatters took several domain names pertaining to that name he dropped the k from Rock and became Roc Hoover.Mike and Mike in the Morning, ESPN, air date May 15, 2007. He announced on May 4, 2007, that he was cast as Detective Roc Hoover, a recurring role, on the soap opera, Guiding Light.Mike and Mike in the Morning, ESPN, air date May 4, 2007. Schlereth was a featured athlete on Athlete 360, a sports medicine television show. After the 2010‚Äì11 NFC Championship Game, Schlereth was one of the critics of Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler, writing \\"As a guy who had 20 knee surgeries you'd have to drag me out on a stretcher to leave a championship game!\\" In 2012 Schlereth appeared on the Discovery Channel show American Guns. He worked with the staff at Gunsmoke gun shop to find a suitable firearm he could use on a hunting trip with his son. Since 2015, he has appeared as himself in a number of episodes of HBO's Ballers. Personal life Mark is the father of three children, Alexandria, Avery, and Daniel. Mark's daughter, Alexandria, was an actress featured on the MyNetworkTV series Desire. Avery was a contestant on Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce's reality dating show Catching Kelce. Mark's son Daniel was selected in the 2008 Major League Baseball's first year player draft. A relief pitcher at the University of Arizona, Daniel was drafted in the first round by the Arizona Diamondbacks with the 26th overall selection. He is currently on the Sugar Land Skeeters roster. He was previously been a member of the Seattle Mariners, Miami Marlins, Toronto Blue Jays, Pittsburgh Pirates, Baltimore Orioles, Detroit Tigers and Chicago Cubs organizations.

His ringing and expressive coloratura dexterity in the highest register of his voice, the tenorino, inspired the writing of operatic roles which today are almost impossible to cast. As a singer Rubini was the major early exponent of the Romantic style of the bel canto era of Vincenzo Bellini and Gaetano Donizetti. Rubini is remembered as an extraordinary bel canto singer, one of the most famous in Europe in the 1820s to 1840s.Osborne 1990, p. 71: Osborne notes in regard to an aria from Rossini's 1821 \\"pastoral cantata\\", La riconoscenza, which was \\"written for the preternaturally gifted young tenor Giovanni Battista Rubini\\" whom the composer had heard singing the Prince in [Rossini]'s La cenerentola and whose singing he described as \\"singing which you can feel in your soul\\". He also popularized the use of a pervasive vibrato as a means of heightening the emotional impact of his operatic performances.Scott, Michael, The Record of Singing: he discusses Rubini's influence on subsequent tenors However, if his upper register was exceptional‚Äîhe could effortlessly go up to a \\"ringing\\" high F (F5) (a note that most tenors today escape because of their \\"chesty\\" technique),Green 2008, p. 167. he was reported as barely audible in the others parts of his voice and his tone was \\"slightly veiled\\".Zucker, Stefan, (February 13, 1982), \\"Last of a Breed: Giovanni Battista Rubini Ruled as the Paragon of Virtuoso Tenors, King of the High F's\\", Opera News, Volume 46, No. 12. He also had a limited volume control, struggling to produce mezzo-forte or mezzo-piano dynamics. On the other hand, he was admired for the \\"infectious\\" joy he took to sing, his great agility and refined musicianship. Career Giovanni Battista Rubini Born in Romano di Lombardia, Rubini began as a violinist at twelve years of age at the Teatro Riccardi in Bergamo. His first appearance as singer was 1814 in Pavia in Le lagrime d'una vedova by Pietro Generali. After ten years spent in Naples between 1815 and 1825, during which he also scored spectacular successes in France in the 1825/26 season in opera by Rossini, he moved permanently to Paris, performing in Rossini's La Cenerentola, Otello, and La donna del lago. He divided his time between Paris (in the Autumn and Winter) and London (in the Spring). His special relation with Vincenzo Bellini began with Bianca e Fernando (1826) and continued until I puritani (1835), when he was one of the long-remembered \\"Puritani quartet\\" for whose voices the opera was written. The three other members of the illustrious quartet were Giulia Grisi, Antonio Tamburini and Luigi Lablache, The four appeared together again in Donizetti's Marino Faliero during the same season, then travelled to London with the Irish composer Michael William Balfe for a further round of operatic engagements. Rubini was admitted as an honorary member of the Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna and retired with a great fortune in 1845. He died in his hometown of Romano in 1854, and is buried in the cemetery there, within a large marble monument.

The church is approximately 450 metres from Telok Ayer MRT station. Founded in 1889, TACMC is the first Chinese Methodist Church to be established in Singapore. It has stood on Telok Ayer Street for more than a century. TACMC is presently affiliated to the Chinese Annual Conference of the Methodist Church in Singapore. It was gazetted a national monument by Singapore‚Äôs Urban Redevelopment Authority on 23 March 1989. History In 1889, a Methodist missionary and medical doctor, Dr. Benjamin Franklin West, arrived in Singapore to set up his dispensary and home on Japan Street (now Boon Tat Street). The Chinese living in the area were mostly Hokkiens and many were opium addicts. Dr. West started services in a rented house in Upper Nankin Street in August 1889. Initially, the congregation was mostly Hokkien- speaking. However, as more migrants from China came from the Methodist strongholds of Henghua, Hockchia and Foochow, many of the Hokkien speakers in the congregation left the church. This led to two Chinese Methodist churches being developed namely, Foochow Methodist Church and the Hokkien Methodist Church. Gradually, the house on Upper Nankin Street where services were being conducted became overcrowded, so new premises were found on Japan Street for the Hokkien Church. In 1906, the Hokkien church became known as Telok Ayer Church. In early 1913, the church bought a piece of land at the junction of Telok Ayer Street and Cecil Street for 3,600 Straits dollars. The site was up the road from Japan Street. A tent was put up on the vacant plot, and services and a Sunday school were held here. In 1914, the tent collapsed and the church moved to the former Fairfield Methodist Girls' School on Neil Road. In September 1915, the congregation returned to the Telok Ayer Street site after a building made of wood and corrugated iron was constructed for about 900 Straits dollars. Telok Ayer Chinese Methodist Church (TA2) at Wishart Road, off Telok Blangah Road In 1921, Ng Hong Guan, a church steward, donated 10,000 Straits dollars towards the construction of a new church building and undertook to solicit more funds. Tenders were called for the construction of a three-storey building. The French firm Bross and Mogin offered the lowest tender fee of 46,000 Straits dollars, a sum that excluded the architect's fee and foundation work. The architectural firm that designed the building was Swan and Maclaren. On 19 January 1924, the church‚Äôs foundation stone was laid by Bishop George Harvey Bickley. Work commenced and the building was ready in December 1924. On 11 January 1925, the Telok Ayer Church was consecrated by Methodist Bishop Titus Lowe. It was in this building that the well-known Chinese evangelist, Dr. John Sung conducted his revival meetings in 1935. Telok Ayer Chinese Methodist Church was gazetted a national monument on 23 March 1989. The church later underwent restoration works which started in October 1993 and were completed in August 1995 at a cost of S$3 million. Telok Ayer Chinese Methodist Church later built a new branch church building on Wishart Road, off Telok Blangah Road. Its new branch building, with an 800-seat auditorium, was completed in 2004 and it is presently known as TA2. The church's Chinese and Hokkien services have been conducted at this church since 2005, while English and afternoon Hokkien services are conducted at the main church building on Telok Ayer Street (TA). The church presently has a weekly attendance of about 1,200 members. Its music programme, which was started in 1935, boasts six all-volunteer choirs ‚Äî three adult, one youth, and two children's choirs. TACMC‚Äôs Honorary Music Director is Dr. Emilia Wong; the church‚Äôs senior pastor is Rev. Chua Ooi Suah. Architecture The sanctuary of the church, which is on the second floor of the building The basic design of Telok Ayer Chinese Methodist Church is western: it has a rectangular main body sitting on arch colonnades. The church is a highly mannered, somewhat eccentric building. Unlike the architecture of traditional churches, TACMC does not have a cruciform plan. Instead, the church reflects its Chinese environment and the time in which it was built. The body of the church is demarcated at its four corners by large, full-height tapered buttress-like forms, within which access is gained to offices and other accommodation on the upper floors. These \\"buttresses\\" are punctured by rectangular and circular window openings and broken by projecting tiled porch roofs at the first storey level. Further, the church itself is arched, lit through large arched, quasi- Byzantine windows and crowned with a continuous tiled roof loggia. Art Deco features can be seen in the ornate window styles. The roof of the pavilion atop the last storey of the building is distinctly Chinese. Features The pulpit used by Dr. John Sung, an evangelist from China, when he conducted revival meetings in the church in 1935 The church has a five foot way on its west side, making the building a part of the surrounding streetscape. *The church has a five foot way on its west side, making the building a part of the surrounding streetscape. It links with the five-foot way to the shophouses on Telok Ayer Street. *Along the church‚Äôs five foot way is a row of columns alternating with piers along its length. This is a design feature seen in eighth-century Byzantine architecture. *There are 14 types of windows and vents of varying sizes and designs. They range from arched windows, to rectangular, square, and round windows. Some are marked with a cross design. Aside from the function of ventilating the building, they act as design features. The windows are complemented by louvred vents. *There are ten types of doors which are also a design feature of this building. They range from wooden double-leaf doors with panels to wooden single-leaf doors to steel and glass panelled single- and double-leaf doors. *The first- and second-storey interiors have eight columns with a moulded scroll design at the column-beam joint and a moulded column base. The ceiling is a coffer ceiling formed by the reinforced concrete longitudinal and cross beams complete with mouldings. *The first storey is a multi-purpose hall named after Dr. Benjamin West. The south entrance to the hall consists of two long doors to ventilate the room well. *The third storey was originally an open terrace with a parapet wall. The terrace was roofed over subsequently and small function rooms put in on either side of the central area consisting of a large room and a multi-purpose hall. The ceiling is also a coffered ceiling but of a simpler design than the original coffered ceilings on the first and second storey. *The church sanctuary is on the second storey. On the apse side of the church is the altar. The wall behind it has the phrase \\"God is love\\" in Chinese characters. To the left and right of the altar are round windows with stained glass. On either side of the sanctuary are long arched windows with timber louvres. The longer windows have wooden panels with Chinese characters in gold. *There is a pavilion on the rooftop with a Chinese-style roof. TACMC is the first Chinese church to have this feature. The pavilion on the roof faces a small rectangular room that balances the outline of the building.

Duties Sir Courtenay Ilbert The Clerk of the House is the principal constitutional adviser to the house, and adviser on all its procedure and business, including parliamentary privilege, and frequently appears before select and joint committees examining constitutional and parliamentary matters. As with all the members of the House Service, he is politically entirely impartial and is not a civil servant. Until 1 January 2008, when the reforms to the house's governance proposed by the Tebbit Review of management and services of the house were implemented, the clerk was the head of the Clerk's Department. He sits at the table of the house, in the right-hand chair (the left-hand chair, looking towards the Speaker‚Äôs chair) for part of every sitting. The historic role of the clerks at the table is to record the decisions of the house (not what is said, which is recorded by Hansard, and this they (but not the clerk) still do. The clerks at the table used to wear court dress with wing collar and white tie, a bob (barrister‚Äôs) wig and a silk gown. However, as of February 2017 the clerks will only have to wear gowns. For the State Opening of Parliament and other state occasions, the Clerk of the House wears full court dress with breeches, and a lace jabot and cuffs.

Biography  Moyreau was born and spent most of his life in Orl√©ans into an old family of the city. He became organist at Orl√©ans Coll√©giale Saint-Aignan in February 1719 and at Orl√©ans Cathedral in January 1738 and occupied this position until around 1772. His music displayed a variety of stylistic innovations and was considerably different from his contemporaries' works. A provincial composer, Moyreau did not achieve much fame during his lifetime and is almost completely forgotten today. His most known and most frequently performed piece is Les Cloches d'Orl√©ans, an organ composition that imitates the bells of Orl√©ans Cathedral. Works Moyreau's surviving oeuvre consists of 6 livres of keyboard music. None of the pieces are dated, but it is known that Moyreau got a publication privilege on 30 January 1753 and that all six collections were published the same year, engraved by Marie-Charlotte Vend√¥me, one of the finest engravers of the era; who was also responsible for the first publication of Mozart's music in 1764 (KV6 and KV7). Moyreau dedicated the pieces to Louis Philippe I, Duke of Orl√©ans (the full title read: Pi√®ces de clavecin d√©di√©es √† Son Altesse S√©r√©nissime Monseigneur le Duc d‚ÄôOrl√©ans). Only one exemplar of books I-II survives, and two of books III-VI. The dance suites from books I-V are particularly notable for their length and variety of included pieces. A single suite may contain as many as 26 movements (which is far more than in any other suite ever composed), usually beginning with an introductory overture followed by several standard dance movements. The movements that come after these are usually pieces with descriptive titles, not unlike Couperin's, highly varied in style and mood. Livre 6, uniquely for French harpsichord music, consists of several three-movement keyboard simphonies written in Italian style. Contemporary sources also mention a treatise by Moyreau, Petit abr√©g√© des principes de musique par demandes et r√©ponses (1753), which has been conserved at Orl√©ans (M√©diath√®que), at the Cornell University of Ithaca and at the Newberry Library of Chicago (USA).

It was formed under the Local Government Act 1894 from that part of the Worksop rural sanitary district which was in the West Riding - the rest going to form Worksop Rural District in Nottinghamshire and Clowne Rural District in Derbyshire. The rural district took its name from the village of Kiveton Park. The rural district originally comprised 11 civil parishes: *Dinnington *Firbeck *Gildingwells *Harthill with Woodall *Letwell *North and South Anston *St Johns with Throapham *Thorpe Salvin *Todwick *Wales *Woodsetts In 1954 the number of parishes was reduced to 10 when Dinnington and St Johns with Throapham were merged to form Dinnington St John's.F A Youngs Jr., Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England, Vol.II: Northern England, London, 1991 The district survived until 1974 when it was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham in South Yorkshire. Coat of arms A coat of arms was granted to Kiveton Park Rural District Council by the College of Arms on 11 March 1949. The blazon of the arms, was as follows: Quarterly ermine and azure, on a cross Or between in the first quarter a cock and a magpie combatant proper, in the second quarter a hart trippant, in the third quarter a garb of the third and in the fourth quarter an oak tree eradicated also proper fructed gold, a torteau charged with a rose argent barbed and seeded also proper; and for a Crest: on a wreath of the colours, a castle of four towers Or.Geoffrey Briggs, Civic and Corporate Heraldry, London, 1971 The basic pattern of the arms was based on those of the Osborne family of Kiveton: quarterly ermine and azure overall a cross Or. Thomas Osborne was created Earl of Danby in 1674, Marquess of Carmarthen in 1689 and Duke of Leeds in 1694.Sir Bernard Burke, A Genealogical and Heraldic Dictionary of the Peerage and Baronetage of the British Empire, London, 1865 In the first quarter were a cock and magpie (or pynot). This refers to the fact that The Earl of Danby was one of the \\"immortal seven\\" who signed the Invitation to William at the Cock and Pynot Inn in 1688. The hart stood for Hart Hill Walk. The garb or wheatsheaf and oak tree represented the rural nature of the area. In the centre of the arms was a Yorkshire rose.

The eldest son of King Conn Bacach O'Neill.Hiram Morgan, Tyrone's Rebellion, The Outbreak of the Nine Years War in Tudor Ireland, The Royal Historical Society, The Boydell Press, p. 86 The then O'Neill, Conn's dynasty held lordship over significant parts of Ulster. Phelim's mother, Lady Alice Fitzgerald, was a daughter of Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare. Phelim's father and maternal grandfather were among the most powerful men in Ireland in early sixteenth-century Ireland. Early life Phelim Caoch (the blind) was a son of Conn Bacach, then The O'Neill, lord of Tyrone. Phelim was raised in the Gaelic fashion at his father's principal residence, his castle at Dungannon, County Tyrone, and was groomed as his father's taniste to one day succeed as lord of Tyrone himself. At the time of his birth, his uncle was The O'Neill, but in 1519, Phelim's father Conn Bacach assumed the title, which was the senior position among the three major O'Neill dynaties: Tyrone, the Fews, and Clanaboy. The O'Neill was traditionally the provincial king of Ulster, with traditional authority over the subservient kings (known as uirr√≠the in Irish) of the province.E. √ì Doibhlin (ed) ‚ÄòCeart Ui N√©ill‚Äô, Seanchas Ardmhhacha, 5, 1970 Phelim grew up learning the diplomacy and art of rule and war in Ulster. He took part in activities of his father's kingdom, including a stint as a hostage to the English just before his death. A part of Irish culture of that period was the custom of raiding. Raids against neighbouring lords for cattle was a primary past time for young noblemen. Especially in Ulster, cattle was main element of wealth. Thus the outcome of a raid weakened or promoted a junior Lord in the sixteenth century Ireland. Later life Phelim was married to Honora O'Neill, daughter of Phelim O'Neill of Edenduffcarrick in Clanaboy. They had a son named Tirlough Brassileagh O'Neill. He gained his nickname from fosterage on the Clan Brassill in southern Ulster. Events Surrounding his Death It was a longstanding vendetta with the lord of one of his fathers MacDonnell Galloglass septs that cost him his life. In early 1542 \\"The son of √ì N√©ill (Phelim Caoch, son of Conn, son of Conn) was killed with one cast of a javelin by MacDonnell Gallowglagh\\" according to the entry recording his death in the Annals of the Four Masters of Ireland.The Four Masters, [ed. John O'Donovan] Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland from the Earliest Times to the Year 1616, Third edition, De B√∫rca Rare Books (Dublin, 1990). p. 1467.

Consequences One is left to wonder what might have happened had Phelim Caoch lived. After his death, Conn Bacach had no nominated taniste and capriciously passed over the interests of his son Shane, a boy of only six or seven years old, by favoring a sixteen-year-old affiliated adopteeSean Ghall, 'An Historical Note on Shane O'Neill,' The Catholic Bulletin, vol XIII, April‚ÄìMay 1923, pgs, 311-314. named Mathew Kelly, (known in Irish as 'Feardorcha') the son of Alison Kelly (n√©, Roth), his current mistress. Conn's decision to take Mathew Kelly when he travelled to London to be created Earl of Tyrone would be the source of a sixty-year feud within the O'Neill dynasty when Mathew was made Baron of Dungannon and nominated as Conn's successor in English law, setting aside the superior claims of his sons, Conn √ìg, Shane and Tirlough.See Genealogical chart, Hiram Morgan, op cit, pgs. 86-7 After Phelim Caoch's assassination Gillespic MacDonnell's galloglass sept became committed the adherents of Mathew (Feardorcha) and his descendants, and consistent supporters of English policy.Donald M.

It centers around the 6-mile-long (10 km) Ichetucknee River, which flows through shaded hammocks and wetlands into the Santa Fe River. The park contains hardwood hammock and limestone outcrops. Like many rivers in this part of North Florida, the Ichetucknee is fed by natural springs which boil up (in various holes) from the aquifer. The state of Florida purchased the property in 1970 from the Loncala Phosphate Corporation for $1,850,000.  History = Phosphate Mining  Exploration mining for phosphate began prior to the start of the 20th century, which consisted of mule and wheelbarrow-assisted excavation. Later, boilers, pumps and steam shovels were used to extract ores. Compared to present-day methods, the early phase of mining used were less intrusive.  The Loncala Era  During the 1950s and 1960s, Loncala Phosphate Company owned the land surrounding Ichetucknee Springs. During this time, people discovered tubing, which brought college students from Gainesville to the river and springs to be what became a summer ritual. In 1970, Loncala sold the peoperty to the state of Florida out of concern for the protection of the spring-run ecosystem. After being cleaned and facilities being built, the river and springs were declared a National Natural Landmark in 1972. Fauna Park wildlife includes white-tailed deer, raccoons, wild turkeys, wood ducks and great blue herons. There are also fish and reptiles: i.e. turtles, water snakes, American alligators, North American river otters, West Indian manatees in the winter months, crayfish, bream, bluegill, largemouth bass, alligator gar, mullet, catfish, and several types of minnows. Recreational activities During the summer, one of the most popular park activities is floating down the Ichetucknee River in an innertube. From the end of May until early September, \\"tubing\\" down the river is the premier activity in the park. As the water in this spring-fed river is remarkably clear, swimming, snorkeling and scuba diving are extremely popular. The river's year-round temperature is 72 ¬∞F (22 ¬∞C) and therefore makes for a refreshingly cool escape from the hot afternoon temperatures in the region. Tubes and rafts, as well as snorkeling and diving equipment can be rented from private vendors outside the park. Seasonality: The tubing season from the North entrance begins on the Friday before Memorial Day. Tubing from the North entrance is closed from the day after Labor Day until the Friday before Memorial Day At the South entrance, the tram service operates from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day. Rented innertubes and rafts are dropped off (at the end of the trip) in designated areas at the \\"take-out\\" point. This is a popular weekend getaway for the students (and faculty) of the nearby University of Florida. Amenities within this state park include restrooms, dressing rooms, a concession stand, nature trails, picnic tables and grills. Archaeology A 17th century Spanish mission site has been identified in the park, next to a short tributary connecting Fig Springs to the Ichetucknee River, about one mile (1.6 km) downstream from the head of the river. The mission has been provisionally identified as San Mart√≠n de Timucua, which was occupied in the first half of the 17th century. Plans to reconstruct the mission and open it to the public as an interpretational site were dropped.Weisman, Brent R. 1993. \\"Archaeology of Fig Springs Mission, Ichetucknee Springs State Park\\", in Bonnie G.

Owned by Newsquest, the newspaper is delivered across central and southern Worcestershire county. History=16th Century Printing Press Worcester was one of the earliest locations in Britain to have a printing press where its first press was established in 1548 and set up by John Oswin who printed several books on it between 1548 and 1553. Stephen Bryan The first established records of a Worcester newspaper date from 1690 when Stephen Bryan founded the Worcester Post-Man, which has been published ever since, although its name changed to the Worcester Journal and then to the current name Berrow's Worcester Journal, thus laying claim to being the oldest newspaper in the world in continuous and current production. Local news was relatively rare in the first decade of publication and it was published irregularly from 1690 until 1709, the period following the deposing of James II (& VII) after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 which had seen the beginning of a free press in the country. After about 1720 Bryan began to include more local items.Wiles, p. 257 In the time that Bryan owned the paper it was published on Fridays.Wiles, p. 65 Berrow Family Front page of Berrow's Worcester Journal dated 7 January 1779. In April 1748, Bryan sold the paper to Harvey Berrow who changed its name to The Worcester Journal and its publication day to Thursday. From 11 October 1753 the paper was published as Berrow's Worcester Journal.Wiles, p. 506 This final name change was prompted when a competitor, Richard Lewis, tried to profit from the success of the Worcester Journal by launching the similar-sounding New Worcester Journal. Lewis's other efforts to take market share from the older paper included publishing on Wednesdays (the day before Berrow) and circulating a report in Bewdley, Kidderminster, and Stourbridge that Berrow's newsmen had left his service.Wiles, p. 91 Berrow was the third son of Capel Berrow (died 1751), a clergyman, and younger brother of Capel Berrow the writer, and was an apothecary in Peterborough. This was not unusual during this time as early newspaper proprietors would sell medicines alongside their newspapers. Berrow promoted in his paper his elixir for dropsy and his powder for gout. The paper was sold for 2¬Ωd every week with five pages. Harvey Berrow carried on the Journal until his death on 16 August 1776, when his eldest son, also Harvey Berrow, continued the publication until his death in the following year, on 11 June 1777. The newspaper was succeeded by his sister, Elizabeth Berrow, whose name appeared upon the Journal until 23 December 1779, after which her name is superseded by that of John Tymbs, to whom she was married on 23 September 1779. Present Era In 1982 Berrow's Worcester Journal was taken over by Reed International. The style of the newspaper changed on 26 June 1987 when it became a free newspaper. In 1990, the newspaper celebrated its Tercentenary (1690-1990) and specially commissioned china was produced by Royal Worcester Porcelain, at its nearby city factory, to mark the historic occasion. Although the Berrow family have long ceased to have any connection with the paper, their name has perpetuated and the paper continues to be published weekly. Alongside free doorstep delivery, the newspaper is accessible as a free and unsubscribed online edition.

Capital strikes may arise from the determination that return on investment may be low or nonexistent or from the belief that by withholding investment certain political or economic changes may be achieved‚Äîor from a combination of the two. Capital strikes can be economy-wide, or take place in a specific industry. Capital strikes may sometimes result when governments pursue policies that investors consider \\"unfriendly\\" or \\"inflexible,\\" such as rent control or nationalization. The term can refer to a capital strike by a single investor or a large group. Capital strikes are commonly invoked as the business-owner/shareholder equivalent of a labor strike, and are often tied to the concept of capital flight. Capital strike was originally a derogatory term, but has been used more neutrally in modern politics. Examples It is difficult to determine with any certainty when a decline in business investment is the result of a \\"capital strike\\" against certain policies or a response to other economic factors. Most often, the phrase \\"capital strike\\" is used to describe resistance to labor-friendly or left wing reforms which are perceived or intended to be against the interests of business owners and investors. * U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt argued that the Recession of 1937 was caused by a capital strike organized to undermine the New Deal and his new taxes on high incomes. * In December 1978, banks financing the debt of the city of Cleveland, Ohio engaged in a capital strike by refusing to roll over the city's municipal debt when the Mayor, Dennis Kucinich, refused to sell the publicly owned electric company, the Cleveland Municipal Light Plant. Cleveland would later enter default. * French President Fran√ßois Mitterrand is said to have faced a capital strike when capital fled France following the 1982 nationalization of a large number of private firms and other labor market reforms. * Chilean President Salvador Allende is said to have faced a capital strike when investment fell after his election as he was the leader of a left- wing coalition that proposed large-scale nationalizations and far-reaching economic reforms. * U.S. President Barack Obama was sometimes said to have faced a capital strike during the Great Recession, including then Speaker of the House John Boehner saying that \\"job creators in America are on strike\\" in response to uncertainty over the Obama administration's economic policies.  Impacts  Capital strikes have historically impacted economies and governments in a variety of ways and provoked a variety of responses. * The Roosevelt administration took an aggressive stance in response to the recession and alleged capital strike. Roosevelt railed publicly against monopoly business interests, and signed into law a total of $3.75 billion worth of new congressionally allocated government spending to be divided among government recovery agencies, which helped spur economic rehabilitation. * Disinvestment and international market pressures forced the Mitterrand government to reverse course on economic policy, making significant cuts to public spending, raising individual taxes, and setting a hard ceiling on deficit spending. * While the capital strike, often manifested through the intentional under-production of necessity goods, damaged Salvador Allende's government, it maintained significant popular support among working class Chileans until it was overthrown in a 1973 U.S. supported coup that put in place a more business-friendly Military Junta lead by General Augusto Pinochet. * Under pressure from large firms withholding investment, the Obama administration pursued several pro-business reconciliation initiatives such as cutting corporate tax rates, pursuing free trade deals, and limiting government regulation, but still signed into law mild financial regulations, the Affordable Care Act, and the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.  Conditions under which capital strikes are effective  Given that capital strikes have succeeded or failed in a variety of situations, predicting what conditions favor them is particularly difficult. Some have put forward that capital controls are one key method by which governments can mitigate the effectiveness of disinvestment and capital flight, but their usefulness has been disputed. The effectiveness of modern purported capital strikes in Greece and Venezuela have been attributed to the sheer size and reach of the financial firms involved.  In popular culture  A capital strike is the premise of Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged.

He was among the most important argumentation theorists of the twentieth century. His chief work is the Trait√© de l'argumentation ‚Äì la nouvelle rh√©torique (1958), with Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca, translated into English as The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation, by John Wilkinson and Purcell Weaver (1969).  Life and work  Perelman and his family emigrated from Warsaw to Antwerp, Belgium in 1925. He began his undergraduate studies at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, where he would remain for the duration of his career. He earned a doctorate in law in 1934, and after completing a dissertation on the philosopher and mathematician Gottlob Frege, earned a second doctorate in 1938. In the same year, Perelman was appointed lecturer at Brussels in the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters. By the end of the war, he became the youngest full professor in the history of that university. Perelman's friend Mieczys≈Çaw Maneli wrote: \\"Perelman was a Belgian, a Jew, a Pole and an authentic cosmopolitan...If one prefers to call Perelman a Polish Jew, then only in the sense suggested by Czeslaw Milosz...[he belonged to] a special category of Jewish-European intellectual, different from all the other Jewish and non-Jewish intellectuals...Perelman was uniquely able to combine his nationality and his humanity in his writings. He was an ardent Belgian patriot and he preserved close ties with Polish scholars and Polish culture at the same time\\". Perelman's initial research in law and philosophy was carried out under the aegis of logical positivism. In 1944, he completed an empiricist study of justice and concluded that since applications of the law always involve value judgments ‚Äì and since values cannot be subjected to the rigors of logic ‚Äì the foundations of justice must be arbitrary. Upon completing the study, Perelman considered its conclusion untenable since value judgments form an integral part of all practical reasoning and decision-making, and to claim that these judgments lack any logical basis was to deny the rational foundations of philosophy, law, politics, and ethics. As a result of his empiricist study of justice, Perelman rejected positivism in favour of regressive philosophies that provided a rationale for value judgments. In 1948, he met Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca, who had also attended the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, and began collaborating on a project that would eventually establish ancient rhetoric as the foundation for a logic of value judgments. In 1958, Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca published their study of informal reasoning as Trait√© de l'argumentation: la nouvelle rh√©torique. Undertaken in the spirit of Fregian observation and synthesis, the work analyzed a wide range of actual arguments from the realms of philosophy, law, politics, ethics, and journalism. The result was a theory of argumentation that was grounded in considerations of value and audience and that outlined points of departure and general techniques for argument. In 1962, Perelman was invited by Henry W. Johnstone and Robert Oliver to take a position at Pennsylvania State University as a distinguished visiting professor. The collaboration between Johnstone and Perelman in particular, which had begun prior to the publication of la nouvelle rh√©torique, proved fruitful. Johnstone created the influential journal Philosophy and Rhetoric, and Perelman became established in the United States as a leading argumentation theorist. Throughout the next two decades, Perelman continued publishing works related to or derived from The New rhetoric. He also made significant contributions to studies in law as director of the National Center for Research in Logic at the Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles, and through continued publications on legal philosophy and argument. In 1973 he was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II. Perelman's friend, Mieczys≈Çaw Maneli, wrote about his attitude towards Judaism: \\"He very consciously rejects any theology or earthly or heavenly salvation, any monism of values, any absolutistic interpretations of human needs and forms of freedoms. Any form of theology is unacceptable towards him\\". In recognition of his academic and civic accomplishments, Perelman was appointed to the baronage by the Belgian legislature in December 1983. In 1962 Cha√Øm Perelman was awarded the Francqui Prize for Human Sciences. He died at his home in Brussels from a heart attack on 22 January 1985.  Perelmanian philosophy  After completing , Perelman rejected the usefulness of logical positivism beyond its applications to pure science. In published five years later, he further outlined the limits of first philosophies or metaphysics. Because these approaches relied on a series of self-evident and mutually supporting axioms, any perceived error would disable the entire philosophy and its claims to reveal universal and absolute truths. Prevalent alternatives, especially the relativism of Jean-Paul Sartre, were also untenable for Perelman since the absolutes of metaphysics were merely replaced in these approaches by absolute skepticism. During his research with Olbrechts-Tyteca, Perelman would develop a philosophy that avoided the absolutes of both positivism and radical relativism. After encountering an excerpt of Brunetto Latini in the appendix of Jean Paulhan's , Perelman began researching ancient Greco-Latin approaches to argumentation. He found that while a specific logic of value judgments had never been established, an approach to the problem was apparent in the works of Aristotle. In the Posterior Analytics, Aristotle establishes the principles of demonstration or analytics, which rely on the accepted premises and necessary conclusions of the syllogism. In the Topics and elsewhere, Aristotle opposes the demonstrative approach to dialectics, or rhetorical reasoning, which relies on premises that are acceptable in a given situation and are thus contingent. With Aristotle's distinctions, Perelman was able to perceive the contradiction of first philosophies: while claiming to reveal universal and absolute truths according to demonstrative methods, philosophy was in reality more concerned with persuading specific audiences to accept its claims. For Perelman, then, a viable philosophy ‚Äì capable of establishing aspects of being and inducing reasonable action ‚Äì must be constructed according to probabilities and must be able to withstand impositions of value and other contingencies stemming from its reception by particular audiences. Perelman's approach, which he termed regressive philosophy, thus sought to incorporate socially constructed truths and to remain amenable to changes should those truths be modified. While rhetoric and argumentation provided the core of Perelman's philosophy, his regressive approach also shaped his treatise on non-formal argumentation. In the conclusion of the , Perelman and Olbrechts- Tyteca state that in opposition to the absolutes common in philosophy, their project acknowledges that \\"men and groups of men adhere to opinions of all sorts with a variable intensity\\" and that \\"these beliefs are not always self- evident, and they rarely deal with clear and distinct ideas.\\" To uncover the logic that governs these beliefs and ideas, Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca rely on a regressive philosophy that accounts for the variability of particular situations and particular values. Perelman would employ this same approach in future developments of the New Rhetoric and in subsequent writings on law and justice.  The New Rhetoric = Overview  Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca began research on the logic of non-formal arguments in 1948. Following Frege's comprehensive approach to the study of mathematics, they collected a wide range of writing from academic, professional, religious, and popular realms to devise and apply their theory. After encountering Latini and \\"rediscovering\\" the Greco-Latin rhetorical tradition, both the project and its philosophical basis took a definitive shape. Perelman hypothesized that the rationale governing non-formal argument could be derived from the principles of rhetorical theory and from considerations of audience and values in particular. These considerations in turn affected the specific structure of arguments, including the bases of agreement and the availability of specific appeals. Perelman's analysis also produced an overview of the various techniques apparent across the diverse group of arguments collected in the course of research. The following discussion of the New rhetoric is organized according to the three sections of the book, and covers the major concepts contained in each.  The framework of argumentation  The New Rhetoric is founded on the idea that \\"since argumentation aims at securing the adherence of those to whom it is addressed, it is, in its entirety, relative to the audience to be influenced\\" (1969, p. 19). Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca rely in particular for their theory of argumentation on the twin concepts of universal and particular audiences: while every argument is directed to a specific individual or group, the orator decides what information and what approaches will achieve the greatest adherence according to an ideal audience. This ideal, Perelman explains, can be embodied, for example, \\"in God, in all reasonable and competent men, in the man deliberating or in an elite\\" (2001, p. 1393). Like particular audiences, then, the universal audience is never fixed or absolute but depends on the orator, the content and goals of the argument, and the particular audience to whom the argument is addressed. These considerations determine what information constitutes \\"facts\\" and \\"reasonableness\\" and thus help to determine the universal audience that, in turn, shapes the orator's approach. The adherence of an audience is also determined by the orator's use of values, a further key concept of the New Rhetoric. Perelman's treatment of value and his view of epideictic rhetoric sets his approach apart from that of the ancients and of Aristotle in particular. Aristotle's division of rhetoric into three genres ‚Äì forensic, deliberative, and epideictic ‚Äì is largely motivated by the judgments required for each: forensic or legal arguments require verdicts on past action, deliberative or political rhetoric seeks judgment on future action, and epideictic or ceremonial rhetoric concerns values associated with praise or blame and seeks no specific decisions. For Aristotle, the epideictic genre was of limited importance in the civic realm since it did not concern facts or policies. Perelman, in contrast, believes not only that epideictic rhetoric warrants more attention, but that the values normally limited to that genre are in fact central to all argumentation. \\"Epideictic oratory\\", Perelman argues, \\"has significance and importance for argumentation because it strengthens the disposition toward action by increasing adherence to the values it lauds\\" (1969, p. 50). These values, moreover, are central to the persuasiveness of arguments in all rhetorical genres since the orator always attempts to \\"establish a sense of communion centered around particular values recognized by the audience\\" (1969, p. 51).  The starting points of argumentation  All argumentation, according to Perelman and Olbrechts- Tyteca, must proceed from a point of agreement; contentious matters in particular cannot be introduced until sufficient agreement on prior or related issues has already been established. The bases of agreement are divided into two categories: the first deals with facts, truths, and presumptions; the second with values, hierarchies, and loci of the preferable. Both facts and truths are normally established prior to argument; these are aspects of reality that would be agreed to, for instance, by the universal audience as conceived by the orator. Neither facts nor truths provide opportunity for dispute; as Perelman explains, \\"if we presuppose the coherence of reality and of our truths taken as a whole, there cannot be any conflict between facts and truths on which we would be called to make a decision\\" (2001, p. 1394). Presumptions, like facts and truths, need not be defended. Should the argument require opposing presumptions, however, the orator may overturn previous opinion by proving an opposite case. Values, both concrete and abstract, may also constitute starting points, although none should be treated as universal. Establishing and reinforcing common values is necessary, according to Perelman, because they influence action and determine acceptable behaviour (2001, p. 1394). Values, moreover, are normally arranged in hierarchies that can also serve as starting points for argument. An audience will value both justice and utility, for example, but an argument may require a determination of preference between the two. Like values, hierarchies can be abstract or concrete; they may also be homogeneous, in the case of degrees, or heterogeneous, in the example of honesty and truthfulness. Both values and hierarchies can be justified by the final point of agreement, which Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca term loci of the preferable. These loci or commonplaces are derived from the third book of Aristotle's Topics, and allow agreement according to the determination of which, between two loci, is more preferred. Thus, an argument may begin from the determination that an intrinsic quality, such as health, is preferred over a contingent quality, such as beauty. The final aspect of argument starting points discussed in the New rhetoric is the creation of \\"presence. \\" From the body of ideas that are agreed upon by a given audience, the orator may choose to emphasize or lend presence to certain elements while deemphasizing others. As Perelman explains, \\"things present, things near to us in space and time, act directly on our sensibility, \\" yet if things distant ‚Äì from the past or future ‚Äì are more relevant to the argument, they may be lent presence through specific rhetorical figures, such as hypotyposis or anaphora (2001, p. 1395). All points of agreement, moreover, may be distinguished as primary or secondary according to the purpose of the argument and the composition of the particular audience. This is accomplished, Perelman notes, by linguistic categories that allow the orator to mount arguments \\"under the guise of a descriptive narrative\\" (ibid).  Argument techniques  Because non-formal argument is concerned with the adherence of an audience ‚Äì rather than the mere demonstration of propositions proper to formal logic ‚Äì the orator must ensure that the audience adheres to each successive element of an argument. Perelman outlines two ways the orator may achieve this acceptance or adherence: the first involves associations according to quasi-logical arguments, appeals to reality, and arguments that establish the real; the second approach responds to incompatible opinions through the dissociation of concepts. Quasi-logical arguments, Perelman explains, are \\"similar to the formal structures of logic and mathematics\\" (2001, p. 1396). Definition is a common quasi-logical approach that is used not only for establishing the meaning of a term but also for emphasizing certain features of an object for persuasive purposes. Other quasi-logical arguments include relations of division, arguments of reciprocity, and arguments of probability. While these techniques appear to share the qualities of formal demonstrations, Perelman notes that for all quasi-logical approaches, \\"complementary, nonformal hypotheses are necessary to render the argument compelling\\" (2001, p. 1398). The remaining associative techniques involve appealing to reality and establishing the real. Arguments of the former category can be further divided into those conveying succession and those dealing with coexistence. Relations of succession include causes and effects, such as the consequences of a particular action, or means and ends, such as the projected outcome of an event or process. Relations of coexistence, on the other hand, associate a person or essence to a specific act, and include arguments from authority. Like appeals to the real, arguments that establish the structure of reality can be divided into two categories: arguments from example or model, and arguments by analogy. The former rely on generalizations derived from a single situation, in the case of example, or on the conformation of a single situation to an accepted practice or ethos, in the case of models. Appeals to the real that rely on analogy are common and, according to Perelman, are \\"typical to Plato, Plotinus, and all those who establish hierarchies within reality\\" (2001, p. 1399). These appeals establish the relation between two terms by noting their similarity to another, more familiar set of terms; for example, \\"truth is to Socrates what gold is to a miser. \\" Metaphor, another common aspect of argumentation, is a form of condensed analogy. When orators seek to reconcile incompatible opinions, they may gain adherence by a dissociation of concepts. The final technique discussed by Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca is a common approach in metaphysics that opposes appearances to reality. As Perelman explains, reality is normally perceived \\"through appearances that are taken as signs referring to it. When, however, appearances are incompatible ‚Äì an oar in water looks broken but feels straight to the touch ‚Äì we must admit...that some appearances are illusory and may lead us to error regarding the real\\" (2001, p. 1400). This recognition in turn fosters a conception of reality by which appearances may be judged; those aspects conforming to the real are considered valuable, while those not consistent with reality are dismissed as illusive. The dissociation of ideas can be extended to any realm where the tenets of an argument are incompatible with accepted opinion; \\"real democracy\\", for instance, can be opposed to \\"apparent democracy, or formal or nominal democracy, or quasi-democracy\\" (ibid. ). In the process of this opposition, adherence to \\"real democracy\\" is achieved not on the basis of its merit as an idea, but rather through the devaluation of opposing terms.  Responses to Perelman and the New Rhetoric  The most common criticisms of the New Rhetoric focus on Perelman's concept of a universal audience. Prominent criticisms by J√ºrgen Habermas, Henry Johnstone Jr., and John Ray challenge the practicality and applicability of Perelman's concept. In response, Perelman and Crosswhite both offer support for the concept of the universal audience. The work has been translated, in whole or in part, into nine languages and has been described variously as \\"groundbreaking,\\" by J. Robert Cox, a \\"bombshell,\\" by Michael Leff, and as \\"one of the most influential modern formulations of rhetorical theory,\\" by Brian Vickers. The New Rhetoric and its later developments have been foundational for argumentation theory in the last thirty years, and Perelman's work has influenced studies ranging from justice and reason to social psychology and political geography. Crosswhite discusses J√ºrgen Habermas's theory of truth in relation to the concept of a universal audience.James Crosswhite, \\"Universality in Rhetoric: Perelman‚Äôs Universal Audience,\\" Philosophy & Rhetoric, 22 .3 (1989): 160, Print. However, when he tries to distinguish between rational consensus and de facto consensus (or truth from agreement), there is limited relevance to the \\"ideal speech situation.\\" Because the universal audience requires there to be equality for all speakers, ideas, and audience members, it is not a realistic representation of a situation that would ever occur and thus the idea of a universal audience is not practical. Perelman's theory of a universal audience includes reasonable people of all time, thus removing the argument or speech out of the context of history. Perelman's theory requires the speaker to understand universal values and ideals throughout history.Henry W. Johnstone, Philosophy & Rhetoric, 20.2 (1987): 130, Print. Henry Johnstone Jr., argues the philosophical and cultural changes over time are sometimes so great, that arguments cannot be universally effective and understood.Henry W. Johnstone, Philosophy & Rhetoric, 20.2 (1987): 131, Print. Simply due to the differences in circumstance, it is impossible for a universal audience to exist. People of a certain time and place, the particular audience, are the limits of persuasive capacities. John Ray critiques the concept of a universal audience as irrelevant because it lacks structure and content. Ray claims a universal audience is disorganized because it is different for each speaker based on his or her purpose.James Crosswhite, \\"Universality in Rhetoric: Perelman‚Äôs Universal Audience,\\" Philosophy & Rhetoric, 22 .3 (1989): 161, Print. While the construction of a universal audience does require setting aside \\"all the particular, local features of the audience and consider only those features of the audience one considers universal,\\" the concept of a universal audience will vary based on the motives, goals, and experiences of the speaker.James Crosswhite, \\"Universality in Rhetoric: Perelman‚Äôs Universal Audience,\\" Philosophy & Rhetoric, 22 .3 (1989): 163, Print. When abiding by the universal audience, it is difficult to construct a persuasive argument, as the speaker must use general and vague language to be cognizant of all the audience-members' values and ideals. Ray is concerned that when forced to follow such constraints, the speaker will not only fail to be persuasive, but will also fail to remain valid in specific situations. James Crosswhite addresses concerns about the validity of universal claims in formal argument.James Crosswhite, \\"Universality in Rhetoric: Perelman‚Äôs Universal Audience,\\" Philosophy & Rhetoric, 22 .3 (1989): 157, Print. One way to construct this universal audience is to discover its universal character. The speaker must set aside any conflicting ideas or values, but because this process of creating a universal audience is specific to the circumstances, it can yield different and conflicting ideals as universal. Perelman makes the distinction that when creating a universal audience you should only eliminate conflicting concepts and values that are relevant. Additionally, because the idea of a universal audience itself is empirical, the speaker forms the imagined universal audience based on past experiences and pre-existing notions of how the universal audience should be defined.Cha√Øm Perelman, The New Rhetoric: A Treatise on Argumentation, (Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 1969), 31. Translated by John Wilkinson and Purcell Weaver. While the concept of the universal audience has been criticized for trying to create complete agreement, Perelman claims its main purpose is to steer the speakers towards reasonableness.Cha√Øm Perelman, and Henry W. Johnstone Jr., Philosophy & Rhetoric, 1.1 (Jan.,1968): 21, Print. And in regards to the validity of arguments formed around the universal audience, the creation of a universal audience is a tool and constraint for the speaker.Cha√Øm Perelman, and Henry W. Johnstone Jr., Philosophy & Rhetoric, 1.1 (Jan.,1968): 20, Print. It is meant to be a moral standard when addressing any audience, but will still allow for persuasion and specificity.  Influence  The German philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer cites Perelman's work on rhetoric as an influence on the hermeneutical philosophy he presented in Truth and Method, his masterpiece.

The centre image shows an appulse between the two objects. Appulse is the least apparent distance between one celestial object and another, as seen from a third body during a given period. Appulse is seen in the apparent motion typical of two planets together in the sky, or of the Moon to a star or planet while the Moon orbits Earth, as seen from Earth. An appulse is an apparent phenomenon caused by perspective only; the two objects involved are not near in physical space. An appulse is related to a conjunction, but the definitions differ in detail. While an appulse occurs when the apparent separation between two bodies is at its minimum, a conjunction occurs at the moment when the two bodies have the same right ascension or ecliptic longitude. In general, the precise time of an appulse will be different from that of a conjunction. Objects which exhibit retrograde motion (such as planets) occasionally display an appulse event without an associated conjunction event. In these cases, the two objects appear to approach each other, but turn away before reaching a momentary coincidence of right ascension. When the celestial bodies appear so close together that one actually passes in front of the other, the event is classified as a transit, occultation, or eclipse, and not an appulse. Appulses are naked-eye events for general observers when involving bright planets and the Moon. They facilitate finding faint objects when such objects are involved. Very close appulse events provide an opportunity to witness two objects together in the same telescopic field of view, which is an appealing curiosity in amateur telescopy.

Though the conference started out strictly as a Live action role-playing (larp for short) event, it has since embraced role-playing games in a more general fashion. Today the conference still has an emphasis on larp, but programs devoted to traditional tabletop role-playing as well as newer arrivals such as freeform are common. A live action role-playing avant-garde movement, which pursues radical experimentation and the recognition of role-playing as a form of art, has been connected to the Knutepunkt conferences. The scope of the Knutepunkt conference has expanded rather rapidly over the last few years with participants showing up from numerous non-Scandinavian countries. Since about 2003 Knutepunkt has seen participants from the United States, Germany, France, Poland, Italy, Russia, Estonia, Belarus, Belgium, the Netherlands, Israel, Czech Republic, United Kingdom and Austria, among others. Name Knutepunkt is Norwegian for \\"meeting point\\" or \\"knot point\\" as it can be directly translated as, and locally the term is translated into Swedish Knutpunkt, Danish Knudepunkt and Finnish Solmukohta.

The station is part of the Esk Valley Line and is approximately south east of Middlesbrough railway station. Being just within the borough of Redcar and Cleveland, it can be accessed from the B1380 (Ladgate Lane), between Stewart Park and Ormesby Hall. It is operated by Northern Trains who provide all of the station's passenger services. The station is served by up to sixteen trains per day (four on a Sunday during the spring/summer timetable). Station facilities were upgraded in 2012 as part of the Tees Valley Metro project. The package for the station included a new fully lit waiting shelter, renewed station signage and the installation of CCTV. A long-line Public Address system (PA) has been also been installed, with pre-recorded train announcements. A passenger information screen with details of train times was installed at the station in March 2016. A ticket machine was installed at the station in 2019. The station has a limited number of car parking spaces. History Marton station before it was upgraded in 2012. Ormesby was one of the original railway stations on the Middlesbrough and Guisborough Railway. It was opened on 25 February 1854, serving the village of Ormesby.

Services As of the December 2019 timetable change, Northern Trains run an hourly service on the Esk Valley Line between Middlesbrough and Nunthorpe, with 6 trains (4 trains on Sundays) per day continuing to Whitby. Most trains heading towards Middlesbrough continue to Newcastle and Hexham (with some trains running as far as Carlisle). Additional trains on weekdays and Saturdays run along the Esk Valley Line to Castleton Moor (departing from Marton at 13:03), and Battersby (departing from Marton at 17:07). Following the May 2014 timetable change, the service between Middlesbrough and Nunthorpe was significantly improved, with this allowing for a regular service to the new station at James Cook University Hospital.

This is a project to upgrade the Esk Valley Line, Tees Valley Line and Durham Coast Line to provide a faster and more frequent service. In the initial phases the services will be heavy rail mostly along existing alignments. The later phase may introduce tram-trains to allow street running. The project is backed by all the local authorities through which the system would run. These include Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar & Cleveland, Stockton-On-Tees and Darlington.

This has brought some improvements to Nunthorpe station, including a new waiting shelter, CCTV cameras and digital information screens. The plans for larger-scale upgrades have been dropped due to lack of available funding. Facilities The station is unmanned and has no ticketing provision, so all tickets must be purchased prior to travel or on the train. The main buildings still stand, but are now used as private residential accommodation. A waiting shelter is located on platform 2 (used by trains to Whitby and those that terminate here and return to ), whilst platform 1 has a canopied waiting area adjoining the main building.

The duration of education was increased to two and a half years in 1926 and three years in 1931.History of Yƒ±ldƒ±z Technical University Following the increase in public facilities and the requirement for technical services, a ruling ordered the closure of Nafia Fen Mektebi and the establishment of a Technical School to supply the workforce for the gap between technical officers and professional engineers. The school provided a two-year program for technical officers and a four-year program for engineers. Buildings were granted from the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace annexes, which are still in use today. In the early period, the school consisted of civil and mechanical departments, educating students as technical officers and engineers. Starting with the 1942-1943 semester, electrical and architecture departments were added as part of the Department of Engineering. The school was established as an autonomous higher education and research institution in 1969. With a law which ruled for the closing of special vocational schools in 1971, engineering schools were affiliated with the Istanbul State Engineering and Architectural Academy. Campuses history Yƒ±ldƒ±z Technical University in Istanbul, Faculty of Architecture Yƒ±ldƒ±z University was formed by the merger of the Istanbul State Engineering and Architectural Academy along with affiliated schools of engineering, and related faculties and departments of the Kocaeli State Engineering and Architecture Academy together with the Kocaeli Vocational School. The new university incorporated a Science Institute, a Social Sciences Institute, and the departments of Science- Literature and Engineering, Foreign Languages, Turkish Language, Atat√ºrk Principles & the History of Revolution, Physical Education and Fine Arts. The university took its final name in 1992 as Yƒ±ldƒ±z Technical University. The Faculty of Engineering was divided into four faculties and restructured as: Faculty of Electrical-Electronics, Faculty of Construction, Faculty of Mechanical and Chemical-Metallurgy, and Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences. The Kocaeli Faculty of Engineering and the Kocaeli Vocational School were separated from the university to be restructured as Kocaeli University.

It is located on the Esk Valley Line and is operated by Northern Trains who provide all of the station's passenger services. History The North Eastern Railway built a short line to link (on their route between Picton and ) with on the Middlesbrough and Guisborough Railway (a subsidiary of the Stockton and Darlington Railway). This link line opened on 1 June 1864 but was used at first only for mineral trains. Passenger trains along the route began four years later, and a station at Great Ayton was opened on 1 April 1868. Description The station is on the single track rail line between and and there are only a few trains per day. The goods yard at the station closed down in July 1965 along with many other stations on the Esk Valley line. Until the 1950s, trains used to run from the station to Stokesley, Whitby Town and but only the latter two destinations are now served. Next to Great Ayton station is the village garage and towing service. The station had, until 1934, a full station building complete with booking office and waiting room, this however was demolished to save costs. From the start of the May 2010 timetable Northern Rail began operating a service to and from Newcastle on a Sunday morning (and return in the evening) for holiday makers going to and from Whitby (since increased to two northbound and three southbound trips). The station has only one platform which is usually served by Northern Trains stopping services - these are usually composed of Class 156 Diesel Multiple Units (although Class 142 \\"Pacers\\" used to appear on occasions, but have now been withdrawn). Five services each way are scheduled to call on weekdays & Saturdays (one terminates and returns from Battersby) and four each way on Sundays. Some of these run through to/from via the Durham Coast Line. Additional services (one evening return trip to Whitby and a lunchtime short turn to Castleton Moor and back to Middlesbrough and Newcastle) were introduced at the December 2019 timetable change.Northern Timetable 5 - Middlesbrough to Whitby (Esk Valley Railway) 15 December 2019 - 16 May 2020 Northern, retrieved 21 November 2019 The Esk Valley line is the only rail connection to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway and occasionally one can view locomotives going to and from the railway, information about moves can be obtained from the North Yorkshire Moors Railway.

The test results, defined by the individual needs of the system, are some measurement of how easily the component or application will be to integrate into the environment and these results will then be compared to the software system's non-functional requirement of portability for correctness. The levels of correctness are usually measured by the cost to adapt the software to the new environment compared to the cost of redevelopment. Use cases When multiple subsystems share components of a larger system, portability testing can be used to help prevent propagation of errors throughout the system. Changing or upgrading to a newer system, adapting to a new interface or interfacing a new system in an existing environment are all problems that software systems with longevity will face sooner or later and properly testing the environment for portability can save on overall cost throughout the life of the system. A general guideline for portability testing is that it should be done if the software system is designed to move from one hardware platform, operating system, or web browser to another. Examples * Software designed to run on Macintosh OS X and Microsoft Windows operating systems. * Applications developed to be compatible with Google Android and Apple iOS phones. * Video Games or other graphic intensive software intended to work with OpenGL and DirectX API's. * Software that should be compatible with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers. Attributes There are four testing attributes included in portability testing. The ISO 9126 (1991) standard breaks down portability testing attributes as Installability, Compatibility, Adaptability and Replaceability. The ISO 29119 (2013) standard describes Portability with the attributes of Compatibility, Installability, Interoperability and Localization testing. * Adaptability testing- Functional test to verify that the software can perform all of its intended behaviors in each of the target environments. Using communication standards, such as HTML can help with adaptability. Adaptability may include testing in the following areas: hardware dependency, software dependency, representation dependency, standard language conformance, dependency encapsulation and/or text convertibility. * Compatibility/ Co- existence- Testing the compatibility of multiple, unrelated software systems to co-exist in the same environment, without effecting each other‚Äôs behavior. This is a growing issue with advanced systems, increased functionality and interconnections between systems and subsystems who share components. Components that fail this requirement could have profound effects on a system. For example, if 2 sub-systems share memory or a stack, an error in one could propagate to the other and in some cases cause complete failure of the entire system. * Installability testing- Installation software is tested on its ability to effectively install the target software in the intended environment. Installability may include tests for: space demand, checking prerequisites, installation procedures, completeness, installation interruption, customization, initialization, and/or deinstallation. * Interoperability testing- Testing the capability to communicate, execute programs, or transfer data among various functional units in a manner that requires the user to have little or no knowledge of the unique characteristics of those units. * Localization testing- Localization is also known as internationalization. Its purpose is to test if the software can be understood in using the local language where the software is being used. * Replaceability testing- Testing the capability of one software component to be replaced by another software component within a single system. The system, in regards to the replaced component, should produce the same results that it produced before the replacement. The issues for adaptability also apply for replaceability, but for replaceability you may also need to test for data load-ability and/or convertibility.

The committee was created by Executive Order 9808 on December 5, 1946 and instructed to investigate the status of civil rights in the country and propose measures to strengthen and protect them. After the committee submitted a report of its findings to President Truman, it disbanded in December 1947. History The committee was charged with examining the condition of civil rights in the United States, producing a written report of their findings, and submitting recommendations on improving civil rights in the United States. In December 1947, the committee produced a 178 page report entitled To Secure These Rights: The Report of the President‚Äôs Committee on Civil Rights. In the report, it proposed to establish a permanent Civil Rights Commission, Joint Congressional Committee on Civil Rights, and a Civil Rights Division in the Department of Justice; to develop federal protection from lynching; a permanent fair employment practice commission; to abolish poll taxes; and urged other measures. Furthermore, the report raised the distinct possibility that the UN Charter from 1945 could also be used as a source of law to fight persistent racial discrimination in the US. On July 26, 1948, President Truman advanced the recommendations of the report by signing Executive Order 9980 and Executive Order 9981. Executive Order 9980 ordered the desegregation of the federal work force and Executive Order 9981 ordered the desegregation of the armed services.

Mizell-Eula Johnson State Park is a Florida State Park located in Dania Beach, Florida off Florida State Road A1A. The park is named for late civil rights activists Von Mizell and Eula Johnson, who first pressured Broward County (for years) to have at least one beach for African Americans, then led wade-ins in Ft. Lauderdale in 1961 that led to desegregation of the county's beaches the following year. The park's former namesake, John U. Lloyd, served as Broward County Attorney for over 30 years and was instrumental in obtaining the land for the park. History The park, opened in 1953, was originally the first beach open to African Americans in Broward County, and was first called simply \\"the Colored Beach\\". According to its official web page, \\"it was once the county's designated 'colored beach'\\". That it came into existence was due to 7 years of effort by Dr. Mizell and others. \\"The next challenge was getting the County to approve the construction of an access road leading to the beach, which still lacked any restrooms or shelter.\\" Access was only by boat. A road was not built until 1965. Thanks to the efforts of Mizell and Johnson, Broward County Beaches were desegregated in 1962. Activities and amenities Dr. Von D.

Amenities include a beach, two boat ramps, an education center, picnic tables, grills, and seven covered picnic pavilions. Visitors can rent canoes, kayaks, pavilions, and volleyball nets and balls. The park is open from 8:00 am till sundown year- round. In addition the park includes Whiskey Creek, an inlet which serves as a manatee sanctuary. Within the park is the Dania Beach Erojacks, a popular reef frequented by scuba divers. On July 1, 2016, John U. Lloyd Beach State Park was renamed the Dr. Von D.

It is located on the Esk Valley Line south of and is operated by Northern Trains which provides all of the station's passenger services.  History  thumb Battersby is unusual on the British railway network, due to the layout of the tracks. Formerly the place where the branch from Middlesbrough joined the through route from Whitby to Picton (on the to portion of the former Leeds Northern Railway), the closure of the direct line west of Battersby in 1954 means that all services have to reverse in the station. Until the rationalisation of the signalling in the late 1980s it was common for two trains to do so at the same time, in order to pass each other on the single track Esk Valley line. Trains can still pass each other in the one remaining platform, using the \\"first in, last out\\" principle, as the platform line is signalled to permit two trains to occupy it at once. In its early years Battersby was known as Ingleby Junction, and opened on the Picton to Grosmont line in 1858 when the Ingleby Mining company's private line first linked to the North Yorkshire & Cleveland Railway. The station was renamed to Battersby Junction in 1878 to avoid confusion with Ingleby station, on the Picton Branch, which ran from Battersby to the main line at Picton. The station was simplified to \\"Battersby\\" in 1893 (The NER had a dislike of \\"Junction\\" suffixes and removed most of them).Hoole, K. (1983). Railways of the North York Moors: Dalesman Books. Despite being located along single track routes, Battersby became a major hub with extensive marshalling sidings and three-road engine shed with turntable.Hayes R.H. & Rutter, J.G. (1974). Rosedale Mines and Railway: Scarborough and District Archeological Society. Research Report No. 9 Two terraces with 30 cottages along with two houses were built and still stand today. Battersby used to have three platforms: two long through platforms connected by a central footbridge and a shorter bay platform with a run-round loop. Water towers were located at both ends of the station. Only the one at the current \\"junction end\\" remains today. The signal box located here has long since vanished, but traces of the third platform are still visible and a run-round loop is available for loco-hauled trains.  Services  Following the September 2020 timetable change, Battersby is served by six trains per day (four on Sunday) towards Whitby, and eight trains per day (four on Sunday) towards Nunthorpe and Middlesbrough.

It goes back to a seminal work by Henri Epstein and Vladimir Jurko Glaser. Overview When developing quantum electrodynamics in the 1940s, Shin'ichiro Tomonaga, Julian Schwinger, Richard Feynman, and Freeman Dyson discovered that, in perturbative calculations, problems with divergent integrals abounded. The divergences appeared in calculations involving Feynman diagrams with closed loops of virtual particles. It is an important observation that in perturbative quantum field theory, time-ordered products of distributions arise in a natural way and may lead to ultraviolet divergences in the corresponding calculations. From the mathematical point of view, the problem of divergences is rooted in the fact that the theory of distributions is a purely linear theory, in the sense that the product of two distributions cannot consistently be defined (in general), as was proved by Laurent Schwartz in the 1950s.L. Schwartz, 1954, \\"Sur l'impossibilit√© de la multiplication des distributions\\", Comptes Rendus de L'Acad√©mie des Sciences 239, pp. 847‚Äì848 Epstein and Glaser solved this problem for a special class of distributions that fulfill a causality condition, which itself is a basic requirement in axiomatic quantum field theory. In their original work, Epstein and Glaser studied only theories involving scalar (spinless) particles. Since then, the causal approach has been applied also to a wide range of gauge theories, which represent the most important quantum field theories in modern physics.

He played domestic first-class cricket for Transvaal from 1902. He was a free- hitting batsman and occasional leg-spin bowler. He played Test cricket for South Africa against England in 1905‚Äì06 and 1909‚Äì10, and was a member of the South African teams that toured England in 1904 and 1907 and in 1912 for the Triangular Tournament. On the 1904 tour to England he scored 937 runs in first-class matches, with a batting average of 30, including 115 against Nottinghamshire, but did not play a Test. He played in the five Tests at home against England in 1905‚Äì06, scoring 147 in the 3rd Test at Johannesburg, and two half-centuries. He played in three Tests in the 1907 tour. He was generally less successful as a batsman than in 1904, scoring only 15 runs in five Test innings, but he scored 162 not out against Gloucestershire. He achieved more success as a leg-spin bowler, taking 72 wickets at a bowling average of 13. He played in four Tests against England in 1909‚Äì10, reaching 118 at Durban. He played in five Tests in the Triangular Tournament of 1912, but he did not achieve much with the bat or the ball. First World War He joined the South African Army in the First World War, and was erroneously gazetted as a captain in the 1st Battalion, Cape Corps in August 1916, over several more senior officers. He chose to be reduced in rank voluntarily to lieutenant in December 1916. He served at Morogoro in the East African Campaign in 1916‚Äì17, returning to South African on the hospital ship Oxfordshire in July 1917. In March 1918, he was sent with his unit to Egypt to join the 160th Brigade. He was wounded in the bayonet charge on Turkish troops at Khan Jibeit near Jerusalem on 20 September 1918, part of the Battle of Megiddo, and died at the 47th Stationary Hospital in Gaza, Palestine, nearly a month later.

It is located on the Esk Valley Line and is operated by Northern Trains who provide all of the station's passenger services. History The North Yorkshire & Cleveland Railway opened an extension line from to in stages between 1858 and 1865. Even though the line through Commondale was opened in April 1861, it would be some years before the North Eastern Railway furnished the remote dale with a station. As the area was populated with small hamlets mostly engaged in agriculture, no station was provided immediately, but a siding was furnished for the Cleveland Fire Brick & Pottery Company (CFBaPC). The CFBaPC attracted a workforce which led to a significant rise in the population, which in turn prompted a station to be built in 1891. Previous to this, a signal box had been installed to control the west facing branch to the brickworks and the junction was used to board passengers with the name of Commondale Siding being used as a station name. Records indicate that in 1885, six years before Commondale was given full official station status, 3,555 passenger tickers were sold totalling a revenue of ¬£99. Even with the increased population, passenger numbers were low and apart from the freight siding, the station did not handle any goods during its lifetime. It did have several station masters (eight between 1891 and 1954) though they resided at the other station that they had responsibility for () from 1930 onwards. The station became the first in the area to become an unstaffed halt; this was effective from 16 January 1950. The station is now on the Esk Valley Line and is just short of from to the west, and from to the east. The single platform, on the northern side of the line, has a single brick building, in the same style as other buildings in the hamlet, as opposed to stone built buildings at most other places on the line. Services Following the September 2020 timetable change, Commondale is served by four trains per day towards Whitby, and four trains per day towards Nunthorpe and Middlesbrough.

It was the first game show produced by the Mark Goodson-Bill Todman partnership. The series was originally hosted by Ward Wilson, but is best known for being the first game hosted by Bill Cullen. Although the game format was very simple, Winner Take All served as the genesis for many future game-show formats. It was the first game to use lockout devices, and the first to use returning champions. Gameplay Two contestants - one with a buzzer, the other with a bell - competed in answering general-knowledge questions, questions based on skits performed beforehand, or doing discovery tests (usually while blindfolded) inside the studio. The first contestant to sound their signal and give the right answer to the question would score one point, with a wrong answer allowing the opponent a free chance to answer the next question unopposed. The first player to score three points won the game and a prize, then stayed on to face another challenger. Broadcast history Winner Take All debuted and aired weekdays on CBS Radio on June 3, 1946. Original emcee Ward Wilson stepped down after just three months at the helm, and announcer Bill Cullen stepped in as a temporary host on September 9. Cullen's work on the show stunned executives, who made his hosting job permanent. CBS primetime CBS, noting the show's popularity on daytime radio, moved the series to primetime television on July 1, 1948 with Bud Collyer as host. The radio series continued with Cullen for another two years, with Collyer taking over in August 1950. The televised Winner, while popular, bowed on October 3, 1950. CBS daytime The network refused to give up on a popular format, however, and attempted a second television run for its daytime schedule. Debuting on February 12, 1951 at 2:45 PM with radio personality Barry Gray as emcee, this iteration aired for 45 minutes on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays; on Tuesdays and Thursdays, the show aired for a half- hour and was paired with Bride and Groom. The series originally ran up against the informational show Vacation Wonderland on NBC and local programming on ABC (which did not program from 2:00-3:00 until 1958). On March 12, Wonderland was cut back to 15 minutes and moved to 3:15 PM; its replacement, the soap opera Miss Susan, did not do very well but nonetheless managed to beat Winner by enough in the ratings. The 2:45 slot was not too popular; the two shows to occupy that position prior to Winner, a variety show hosted by Robert Q. Lewis and the 45-minute Johnny Johnston Show, did not last very long - Lewis' show ended after seven weeks, and Johnston's bombed in three weeks. Winner bowed from the television airwaves once again on April 20, 1951, followed by its radio counterpart on February 1, 1952. NBC daytime Meanwhile, NBC, looking for a show to replace its faltering game It's In The Bag at 10:30 AM, struck a deal with Goodson-Todman to air a new daytime version with Cullen returning as emcee. Debuting on February 25, 1952, the series originally went against either local programming or Arthur Godfrey Time on CBS and, as before, local programming on ABC (which did not program at 10:30 until 1964). On the days that Godfrey aired at 10:30, Winner did not fare well. On April 7, CBS permanently slotted a program at 10:30 to provide a constant network opponent to Winner - Bride and Groom. Winner ended on April 25 after just nine weeks. Matinee in New York Winner returned to NBC's daytime schedule on June 9, 1952 in an unorthodox form - as a segment of the hour-long weekday variety show Matinee in New York, which aired at 4:00 PM. Matinee ended on September 5, 1952. Play For Keeps! On November 18, 1955, in the midst of the big- money quiz-show craze, CBS tried a revival for their daytime schedule with Sonny Fox as host.The Game Show Pilot Light: Play For Keeps This pilot is usually cited in \\"what if?\\" discussions regarding a big-money Goodson-Todman quiz show, as in this pilot the \\"returning champion\\" had \\"previously won\\" $15,000 and there was no earnings cap. The rules were a bit different, in that the champion chose from one of ten categories, then wagered all or part of their previous winnings. If the champion defended their title, the money bet was added to their pre-bet total by the show; if the challenger won, s/he got the wagered money and the former champion had the wager deducted from their winnings. The pilot has aired on Buzzr as part of their \\"Lost and Found Week\\" on September 7, 2015 and again on September 13, 2017. Episode status Both the radio and television versions are believed to have been destroyed as per network practices. Of the radio series, only three episodes hosted by Cullen are known to exist. Only two episodes of Gray's version exist, from April 1951. Cullen's version fared better, with four episodes surviving (February 27‚Äì28, March 5, and a fourth episode with a more elaborate set). These six episodes have been seen on GSN at one time or another. On September 13, 2017, Buzzr aired one episode as part of its Lost and Found week. Play For Keeps! is held by the UCLA Film & Television Archive. No Wilson, Collyer, or Matinee-era episodes are known to exist. However, the May 1949 CBS sales film \\"Television Today\\" (made for potential TV advertisers) shows \\"Winner Take All\\" with Bud Collyer and contestants being produced in the CBS studios, provided as example of the kind of fare available on TV at the time.  Overseas = Australia  The Major Broadcasting Network produced a local radio version of the program in the late 1940s and early 50s. It was transferred to the rival Macquarie Radio Network in 1951. The Australian version of the program was compered by Bob Dyer, assisted by his wife Dolly Dyer, an Australian showgirl. Bob Dyer was born in Hartsville, Tennessee, but became a permanent Australian resident in 1940, even though he retained his US citizenship until his death in 1984. Bob and Dolly Dyer compered a number of Australian radio and TV shows, mainly quizzes. They are very well remembered for their radio/TV program Pick a Box.

Dashti was also an Iranian senator. Life Born into a Persian family in Dashti in Bushehr Province, Iran on 31 March 1897. Ali Dashti received a traditional religious education. He studied Islamic theology, history, Arabic and Persian grammar, and classical literature in madrasas in Karbala and Najaf (both in Iraq). He returned to Iran in 1918 and lived in Shiraz, Isfahan, and finally in Tehran, where he became involved in politics of the day. Rather than becoming a cleric, he became a journalist and published a newspaper (Shafaq-e Sorkh) in Tehran from 1922 to 1935. He was a member of Majlis at various times between 1928 and 1946. His criticism of allowing the Tudeh party into the cabinet and concessions to the Soviets landed him in prison in 1946. He was appointed a Senator in 1954 until the Islamic revolution in 1979. In 1975 he gave the papers for his book Bist O Seh Sal (Twenty Three Years) to professor of Persian and Arabic Frank RC Bagley and asked him to translate it, but not to publish it until after his death. He reiterated this request in 1977 and 1978. Frank RC Bagley kept his promise and, having translated and organised Ali Dashti's papers into a publishable format, the book was printed in 1985. An Iranian newspaper reported Ali Dashti's death in the month of Dey of the Iranian year 1360, i.e. between 22 December 1981 and 20 January 1982. Writing  In the book 23 Years: A Study of Prophetic Career of Mohammad, Dashti chooses reason over blind faith: : \\"Belief can blunt human reason and common sense, even in learned scholars. What is needed is more impartial study.\\" Dashti strongly denied the miracles ascribed to Muhammad by the Islamic tradition and rejected the Muslim view that the Quran is the word of God himself. Instead, he favors thorough and skeptical examination of all orthodox belief systems. Dashti argues that the Quran contains nothing new in the sense of ideas not already expressed by others. All the moral precepts of the Quran are self-evident and generally acknowledged. The stories in it are taken in identical or slightly modified forms from the lore of the Jews and the Christians, whose rabbis and monks Muhammad had met and consulted on his journeys to Syria, and from memories conserved by the descendants of the peoples of Ad and Thamud. Muhammad reiterated principles which mankind had already conceived in earlier centuries and many places. : \\"Confucius, Buddha, Zoroaster, Socrates, Moses, and Jesus had said similar things. Many of the duties and rites of Islam are continuous practices which the pagan Arabs had adopted from the Jews.\\" Bibliography  * Dashti on Persian Classics: Naqshi az Hafez (1936), on the poet Hafez (ca. 1319-1390).

His heroines engage in flirtations and intrigues with no apparent motive except cold calculation. Nevertheless, these stories are very readable, and they provide a vivid, and no doubt partly accurate, record of the social life of the upper classes and the psychological problems of the educated women in Tehran at the time. *Newspapers: He succeeded in establishing his own newspaper at Tehran, Shafaq-e Sorkh (Red Dawn), which lasted from 1 March 1922 until 18 March 1935. He was its editor until 1 March 1931, when Ma'el Tuyserkani took over. *Political Works Collected Articles: Ayyam-e Mahbas (Prison Days) (1922) Panjah o Panj (Fifty Five) on major and influential political personalities of Iran *Translations into Persian: Edmond Demolins's A quoi tient La superiorite des Anglo-Saxons Samuel Smiles's Self-Help translated into Persian from Arabic Criticism Criticism on Ali Dashti dates back to the 1940s when Gholamhossein Mosaheb, founder of The Persian Encyclopedia, wrote a book named Ali Dashti's plots. Mosahab has another note on Dashti which he published as an anonymous author in the Shafagh newspaper around the same time.The reference for this section of the article is a journal paper published by the Iranian historian, Abdollah Shahbazi titled \\"Life and timeline of Ali Dashti\\" available here in Persian. Supporting Reza Pahlavi According to Mossahab, \\"ever since Reza Pahlavi assumed head of the defense ministry and violated the constitution, Dashti supported him\\". He indicates Dashti's article in a newspaper back in 1930 where Dashti addresses Reza Pahlavi as a \\"national symbol\\". Dashti's alleged role in Reza Pahlavi's assumption of power was so large that the famous poet Mohammad-Taqi Bahar mentions his name in his political poem, \\"Jomhoori Nameh\\"(The republic letter). Spying for the British In the fifth Iranian national assembly, Hassan Modarres presented documents showing Dashti's relations with the British government and the mutual support by the British to help him become a congressman. The documents were published in the \\"Siasat\\" newspaper at that time in which the British ambassador was ordering some to financially support Dashti in return for his service. As a result, Dashti's petition to enter the congress was denied by the majority of congressmen. The book \\"55\\" In 1977, Dashti wrote a book titled \\"The 55\\", a sympathetic account of the 55 years of the Pahlavi family's reign. The council of Tehran University nominated Dashti for an honorary Doctoral degree. The reviews were polarized. One of his harsher critics, Ehsan Tabari, wrote: :In Iran's contemporary history, there are and have been men like, Taghi-zadeh, Doctor Rezazadeh Shafagh and the very Mr. Ali Dashti, who spent all they ever owned serving the tyrants in return for their personal benefits; or as the poet says \\"They have enslaved knowledge, freedom, faith and fairness\\"; or, as in the proverb taken from the Gospel teachings, \\"spared the pearl for the pigs\\". When the Iranian revolution occurred two years later, Dashti published a book named \\"The Fall Factors\\", a critical analysis of the Pahlavi dynasty exploring the reasons behind its downfall.

The trail starts at Boulter's Way in Arnold and ends near Baltimore Light Rail's Cromwell Station in Glen Burnie. Starting near Annapolis at Jonas Green Park, the trail passes (northward) through Arnold, Severna Park, Millersville, Pasadena, and Glen Burnie. The Baltimore & Annapolis Trail follows the route of the Baltimore & Annapolis Railroad from which it derives its name. Proposed in 1972 by Jim Hague, it opened on Oct 7, 1990 as the second rail trail in Maryland. In June 1996, the Baltimore & Annapolis Trail became part of the East Coast Greenway-from Calais, Maine to Key West, Florida. The trail is part of the American Discovery Trail-a trail from the Atlantic coast of Delaware to San Francisco, California. Trail description Built on a former rail line through the suburban region between Annapolis and Baltimore the trail is a paved linear park that encompasses . The trail winds through parks, neighborhoods and natural wooded areas providing scenic views of trees, streams and many historical points. Two of the major stops on the trail are Severna Park at mile 4.8, and Glen Burnie at mile 12.7. The trail also goes by the Marley Station Mall and the Ranger Station. Along the trail are historical markers labeled A to Z, which correspond to the Guide to Historical Markers on the B&A; Trail, written by park volunteer Barry Miller. The historical markers were designed and placed as an Eagle Scout service project by William Brian Sanders of Boy Scout Troop No. 1785 (of Pasadena, Maryland) in 1993. The A marker is near the Annapolis end of the trail at the Winchester Station House, mile 0.1. Marker Z, at mile 13.3, is for the Sawmill Branch, which was a source of water and power for residents in the early 18th century. The historic markers illustrate the communities the railroad helped develop between Baltimore and Annapolis, and the individual achievements of people within these communities. The trail also has switch boxes and sections of track lining the trail. The trail is lined with flowerbeds and kiosks and includes a Planet Walk sponsored by NASA. The Planet Walk is a linear museum with educational displays for each planet and the sun. The main scenery around the park is forested land, and it contains several bridges. It is also paralleled by a Baltimore Gas and Electric distribution line for almost all of its length. The trail ends in the north at Glen Burnie near the intersection of Maryland Routes 176 and 648, where it connects to the BWI Trail Loop, a loop around the Baltimore‚ÄìWashington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. The right-of-way for the former railroad continues to the north as the Baltimore Light Rail, which begins in the south at Cromwell Station. Since 1998, the trail has hosted the popular B&A; Trail Marathon and Half Marathon each spring, which draws approximately 225 marathoners and 650 half marathoners. History of the railroad The trail derives its name from the last name the railroad line used before ceasing operations. The railroad started as the Annapolis and Baltimore Short Line on March 9, 1887, though it was more commonly known as the Annapolis Short Line. In 1921 it became the North Shore line of the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway and in 1935 it began its final incarnation as the B&A.; The railroad ended passenger service in 1950 and freight service stopped going south of Glen Burnie when a trestle washed out in 1969. The property deteriorated and became an eyesore. Public interest in a linear park began in the mid-1970s and in 1979 Anne Arundel County purchased the wide corridor for the purpose of creating a rail trail and park. The WB&A;'s main line right of way also serves as a rail trail, the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Trail.

Professional career Beriault was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the sixth round (208th overall) of the 2005 NFL Draft and gave him Bill Bates' number (40). After playing in several preseason games at strong safety and earning praise from the Cowboys' coaching staff, he suffered a knee injury that forced the Cowboys to place him on the injured reserve list on September 3, 2005. He had a dual surgery performed to repair torn medial and lateral meniscus in his right knee, a procedure thought to be career threatening, because at the time no NFL player had fully recovered from an osteotomy surgery. The next year, he participated in training camp, but ended up announcing his retirement on August 14, 2006.

It is located on the Esk Valley Line and is operated by Northern Trains who provide all of the station's passenger services. History The station opened in April 1861 as the temporary terminus of the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Railway route from Stokesley. This was extended eastwards to four years later - formal opening occurring on 2 October 1865 with the station being named simply Castleton. A direct link from through to Nunthorpe & was also commissioned at this time - this is the route now used by all trains, as the original line west of Battersby was closed to passengers in June 1954 and completely four years later. In 1966, the station was renamed Castleton Moor. Though the line was built with a single track, the station was provided with two platforms as it was the location of one of the route's passing loops. A signal box was also constructed here, along with a goods shed and associated yard - these all survived (along with the loop) until the final withdrawal of goods services over the route in 1982. The goods shed can still be seen but the loop has been lifted, the second platform removed and the box demolished. Services Following the September 2020 timetable change, Castleton Moor is served by five trains per day (four on Sunday) towards Whitby, and six trains per day (four on Sunday) towards Nunthorpe and Middlesbrough.

The club was founded in 1868 and is one of the oldest curling clubs in the United States. A member of the Grand National Curling Club (GNCC), the Utica Curling Club is the largest curling club on the East Coast, and has 6 sheets of ice and over 200 members.

Thousands were coming to America from the British Isles and Europe drawn by the promise of food, jobs, and prosperity. The Mohawk Valley, with its abundance of water-power and its strategic location in relation to transportation, was on the leading edge of industrialization. The population of the area was growing rapidly, and two out of three Uticans were born in foreign countries or were children of immigrants. In this great \\"Melting Pot\\", the heritage of these new Americans tempered the area with new traditions and customs. The earliest recorded curling events locally were organized by Scotch and English textile workers in Clark Mills in 1832. In 1855, the sport moved to lower Campbell Pond (now Twin Ponds) in New York Mills where it flourished for more than 20 years. Many Uticans were part of this group and traversed the three mile distance in horse drawn sleds. Benjamin Allen, who arrived from England in 1832, was an expert stone-cutter and worked on the Erie Canal Expansion, the Chenango Canal and various other building projects. He was an avid curler that participated in the games held on the Chenango Canal, the Globe Mill Pond in West Utica, Butterfield skating rink on Jewett Street, on the Erie Canal, and sometimes on the Mohawk River flats. Allen purchased property that contained Ballou Creek where it emptied into the Erie Canal. By damming the shallow section of the creek near Rutger Street, he was able to form a large ice surface that could be used for curling and ice skating. In 1868, he formed the Utica Curling club. In 1874, the rink area was fenced in and a small shed with wood-burning stove was built. That same year, the New York Mills Curling Club merged with Utica and joined the Grand National Curling club as the Utica Curling Club. To reduce the shoveling that curling outdoors required, a large building was erected in 1891-92 that could house 3 sheets of curling ice under cover and could also be used for skating. Refrigeration was provided by opening the large windows on three sides of the building. It was known as Rutger Rink and was home of the Utica Curling Club until 1916. The facility was willed to the Utica Curling Club by Benjamin Allen's son, W. Fred. In 1916, the city of Utica, looking to expand its boundaries and expand Rutger Street eastward, paid the Club nearly $20,000 for the building and property. The club bought property on Francis Street and began construction on the new Clubhouse in October 1916. The building housed 5 sheets of ice and again, refrigeration was provided (or withheld) by Mother Nature through large windows in the curling shed. Even though no curling clubs had artificial ice prior to World War I, A.S. Brinckerhoff, a member of the building committee and long time ice chairman of the old Rutger Rink, had insisted that a basement room in the new Francis Street building be designed to hold equipment for ice-making. By 1923, the membership limit of 180 had been reached and a waiting list established. Then came two disastrous winters of thaws, uncompleted schedules, and wrecked bonspiels. The natural decision followed - an artificial ice plant was installed. As a result of old \\"Brink's\\" foresight, when the York Ice Machinery Co. made the installation in 1925, not a single change had to be made in the basement to accommodate the equipment. The depression of 1930-39 demanded rigid economy and required individual financial aid to tide over some unbalanced budgets, but curling never declined. In the early forties, women relatives of club members got permission to use the ice, when available, for fifty cents per person per game. In 1948, on behalf of women relatives and friends, Marjorie Foster submitted a report of the women‚Äôs activities, and in September 1948, the men voted to accept the women as associate members. The women‚Äôs organization, first led by Marge Foster, was originally named the Utica Tartans, but in 1949 changed their name to the Utica Glengarries. The invitation of women to curl gave the club its most pronounced increase in membership. Women became full membershs with voting privileges in 1990. Read a full history of the Glengarries. (women did not gain full membership and voting privileges until 1990). Mixed curling became a staple of the club, and our famous Mixed Bonspiel was started in 1953. Teenagers began to curl in 1954; Little Rockers (ages 6‚Äì12) in 1989. The original Glengarry pin, affectionately known as the ‚Äústick lady‚Äù was designed by a charter Glengarries member, Lynda More. At the same time, she created a companion pin for the men. Both were curling stone stick figures with a U for Utica surrounding the figure. After a few years, the Lynda created a second pin for Glengarries to trade at bonspiels. It is a shield in white, blue, and gold, with a Glengarry hat, crossed brooms, a stone, and a thistle. Mixed curling became a staple of the club, and our famous Mixed Bonspiel was started in 1953, so a mixed pin was created, combining the male and female heads on a single pin. A major expansion was undertaken in 1958-59, which was also the first time that all five sheets had matched stones. In 1962 a new ice base was installed, with indirect refrigeration which removed the hazard of pressurized ammonia gas inside the curling shed. The interior was upgraded in 1975 and 76 (paneling and modern kitchen). Most importantly, our stones were replaced at the start of the 1985-86 season with the new Ailsa Craig insert stones with modern plastic handles. In 1995, the Francis Street club was destroyed by fire. But by 1996, a new facility with 6 sheets of ice had opened on Clark Mills Road in Whitestown. In honor of this \\"resurrection from the ashes‚Äù, Tom Garber designed a new Phoenix logo and pin. Since then the building has been modified for wheelchair curlers and others with disabilities. The new facility has been host to the U.S. men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs championships, the U.S. club championships, the college national championships, and in 2011 celebrated the 100th anniversary of hosting the Mitchell Bonspiel, an international men‚Äôs Grand National Curling Club event first held in 1885. The Utica Curling Club now sports almost 300 members embracing novices, long-time curlers, juniors, college curlers, and wheelchair curlers. Teenagers began curling in 1954; Little Rockers (ages 6-12) in 1989. College curling, which had been sporadic, became a permanent addition in 2005 when Hamilton College and Colgate University formed their curling clubs and made the Utica rink their home. SUNY Polytechnic Institute joined in 2015 and we have had representatives from SUNY Binghamton, Syracuse University, Utica College, Cornell University, and Mohawk Valley Community College. Curling has undergone many changes at Utica in the last 149 years. But the Spirit of Curling remains strong as the Utica Curling Club looks forward to its sesquicentennial in 2018. Bonspiels ;Mitchell Mens The Mitchell Medal An international invitational bonspiel, founded by Alexander Mitchell, patron of the Grand National, who placed the medal into competition in Feb. of 1885. Alexander Mitchell, a Scot from Aberdeenshire, moved to Milwaukee in 1839 as the representative of a Scottish insurance company. He became a leading banker, industrialist and later on became President of the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway. In December 1884, he donated the Mitchell Gold Medal for annual competition to be \\"played in the Eastern and Western sections alternately with the Gordon Champion Rink Medal.\\" Mr. Mitchell died of pneumonia in the spring of 1887 and the last Western Competition was held in St. Paul in February 1898. After that it was held only in the East, and in 1916, it was decided to make the Utica Curling Club the permanent host of the bonspiel. There are six events with a four-game guarantee. The 2011 Mitchell was the 126th overall and the 100th to be held at the Utica Curling Club. ;Cobb Mixed An international invitational bonspiel with extensive social activities for out-of-town teams and selected Utica teams (based on performance in the Mixed Championship). There are six medal events.

Bryden was a shareholder in Union Colliery, a coal mining company in British Columbia, and was troubled by the company's practice of employing \\"Chinamen\\" and putting them into positions of authority. He sought an injunction against the company for violating section 4 of the provincial Coal Mines Regulation Act of 1890, which prohibited hiring \\"Chinamen\\" to work in coal mines. Union Colliery challenged the constitutionality of Act, arguing that the prohibition related to matters of naturalization and was under the jurisdiction of the federal government under section 91(25) of the British North America Act, 1867. Bryden, however, argued that since the federal government had no laws covering the matter the province was allowed to step in and legislate on it. The issue before the Council was whether the provinces could legislate in matters under federal jurisdiction where the federal government has remained silent. The Council held that the pith and substance of the provision was in relation to \\"aliens and naturalized subjects\\" and did fall within the federal jurisdiction. They also held that the federal government did not need to pass laws in all areas within their jurisdiction, and under the exclusivity principle the province can never intrude upon the federal jurisdiction. It is only where the two governments make an explicit agreement can the province legislate in federal matters.

He gave up his constituency in order to join the army; during Portuguese participation in World War I, he saw combat himself, and upon returning home he wrote a book about his battle experiences. After President Sid√≥nio Pais was shot dead, Granjo took action against the Monarchy of the North, an attempt to restore a royalist regime in the north of Portugal, in 1919. He was President of the Municipal Chamber of Chaves, from February to July 1919. That same year he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, by the Evolutionist Party, later being a founder of its successor movement, the Republican Liberal Party. Minister of Justice during Domingos Pereira's coalition government, he served two brief terms as Prime Minister, the first time, from 19 July to 20 November 1920, in a liberal government.

Ternary relations may also be referred to as 3-adic, 3-ary, 3-dimensional, or 3-place. Just as a binary relation is formally defined as a set of pairs, i.e. a subset of the Cartesian product of some sets A and B, so a ternary relation is a set of triples, forming a subset of the Cartesian product of three sets A, B and C. An example of a ternary relation in elementary geometry can be given on triples of points, where a triple is in the relation if the three points are collinear. Another geometric example can be obtained by considering triples consisting of two points and a line, where a triple is in the ternary relation if the two points determine (are incident with) the line. Examples=Binary functions A function in two variables, mapping two values from sets A and B, respectively, to a value in C associates to every pair (a,b) in an element f(a, b) in C. Therefore, its graph consists of pairs of the form . Such pairs in which the first element is itself a pair are often identified with triples. This makes the graph of f a ternary relation between A, B and C, consisting of all triples , satisfying , , and Cyclic orders Given any set A whose elements are arranged on a circle, one can define a ternary relation R on A, i.e. a subset of A3 = , by stipulating that holds if and only if the elements a, b and c are pairwise different and when going from a to c in a clockwise direction one passes through b. For example, if A = represents the hours on a clock face, then holds and does not hold. Betweenness relationsTernary equivalence relationCongruence relation The ordinary congruence of arithmetics : a \\\\equiv b \\\\pmod{m} which holds for three integers a, b, and m if and only if m divides a ‚àí b, formally may be considered as a ternary relation. However, usually, this instead is considered as a family of binary relations between the a and the b, indexed by the modulus m. For each fixed m, indeed this binary relation has some natural properties, like being an equivalence relation; while the combined ternary relation in general is not studied as one relation. Typing relation A typing relation \\\\Gamma\\\\vdash e!:!\\\\sigma indicates that e is a term of type \\\\sigma in context \\\\Gamma, and is thus a ternary relation between contexts, terms and types. Schr√∂der rules Given homogeneous relations A, B, and C on a set, a ternary relation (A,\\\\ B,\\\\ C) can be defined using composition of relations AB and inclusion AB ‚äÜ C. Within the calculus of relations each relation A has a converse relation AT and a complement relation \\\\bar{A} . Using these involutions, Augustus De Morgan and Ernst Schr√∂der showed that (A,\\\\ B,\\\\ C)is equivalent to (\\\\bar{C}, B^T, \\\\bar{A}) and also equivalent to (A^T,\\\\ \\\\bar{C},\\\\ \\\\bar{B}).

It is located on the Esk Valley Line and is operated by Northern Trains who provide all of the station's passenger services. Heading up the line in the direction of Middlesbrough, the nearest station is based at Danby, however the hamlet of Houlsyke ( east of Danby) used to have a siding serving the farming community. The points were operated by a ground frame locked by the tablet for the Danby - Glaisdale section.Hoole, K. (1983). Railways of the North York Moors: Dalesman Books. There has often been talk of constructing a halt further up the line to serve the North Yorkshire Moors Centre, situated between Houlsyke and Danby. History Lealholm was opened as part of the final stretch of line from Picton (where the line joined what is now a loop on the East Coast Main Line) to Grosmont (where it met the Whitby - Pickering railway) authorised under the North Yorkshire and Cleveland Railway Act of 10 July 1854. The stretch from Castleton to Grosmont was opened on 2 October 1865, and Lealholm, sometimes referred to in early NER timetables as \\"Lealholme\\" or \\"Lealholm Bridge\\", is located on a stretch of line between Castleton and Glaisdale which has always been single track. Lealholm used to have a passing loop at the station where freight trains could pass passenger trains. The remains of the disused platform are clearly visible, now overgrown with grasses and weeds, although no evidence exists that that platform was ever used during the 20th century. There also used to be a signal box at the station, long since demolished. The station was host to a LNER camping coach from 1937 to 1939 and possibly one for some of 1934. Trains stop at the main station platform where the Station Master's house is based (now a private residence). Only a small internal shelter remains in the station building. Between Castleton and Grosmont, the later section of line to be built, the design of the station buildings uses a crow stepped gable at each end, favoured by the NER company in the mid-1860s. Despite a lack of staffing, the station is well cared for, with plants tended by the village WI. Today, the line is generally quiet except for the school train on a morning and early evening. Like most of the surrounding villages, Lealholm has its own infant and primary school, however pupils travel to secondary schools and a college in Whitby. Lealholm was also home to a typical NER goods shed and coal yard, which later became the factory base when the company Lightspeed panels was set up in 1972. They produced the Magenta kit car - A fibreglass body kit based on a Mini chassis. Today the site is a car repair garage. On Oatmeal Hill next to the station, 4 semi-detached railway cottages were built, finally being sold off privately in 1970. Railway cottages 1&2 with their stone finish were merged to form what is now \\"The Croft\\", and Railway cottages 3&4 (a later addition for lowly railway workers) with its cheaper brick built finish merged to form \\"Oatmill cottage\\". Because of the work required to make the building habitable its brick finish was covered with a distinctive white rendering which, in line with another white house along Lealholmside has often been used as a landmark by RAF fighter jet pilots flying low along the Esk valley. Just downline (in the direction of Whitby) from the station, a vast embankment was built to carry the railway over a valley carrying the small Park Wood Beck. The poet John Castillo spent much of his time in this valley, and in his day it appears to have been a beautiful wooded valley. Today what remains is mainly covered with bracken and grazed by sheep. The beck now runs beneath the embankment in a large cylindrical stone lined tunnel around 8 feet in diameter, and can be walked from end to end. Inside it is pitch black, as due to the curvature of the tunnel it is not possible see from one end to the other. An opening in the wall near the upstream end carries a small brook into the beck. Upline from Lealholm, the railway curves round the village before entering one of the deepest cuttings on the line, to pass through a giant glacial dam formed from rock pushed up the valley during the last great ice age. A very similar range of station buildings, including a goods shed have been carefully restored at Goathland station on the NYMR, both stations were built about the same time and by the same contractor, Thomas Nelson. Proposed branches Downline from Lealholm at Rake Farm, the line was to have met a branch running across the moors to support the Iron ore industry hereabouts. It was never finished although the route's earthworks still exist, and has become known as Paddy Waddell's Railway in honour of the engineer John Waddell and his Irish Navvies who built what remains of the embankments and ditches that can still be found along the route. One completed bridge still survives at Rakes Farm. The original proposals for the Picton to Grosmont Line included plans for a minor branch line leaving the railway upline at nearby Houlsyke and running south to what is now Furnace Farm. this would likely have served ironstone workings, traces of which can be found throughout nearby Fryup Dale.

Biography=Early life Gyr was the son of actor Coco Dumitrescu, from Craiova. He did his secondary studies at the Carol I High School in Craiova. He then studied at the University of Bucharest, where he received his Ph.D. in Literature and became a Senior Lecturer. Iron Guard membership He joined the Iron Guard fascist movement, becoming in time a local commander. During the National Legionary Government he was appointed General Manager of the Romanian Theaters. Under his administration the Bara»ôeum Jewish Theater (later State Jewish Theater) was founded. The creation of the Jewish Theatre was accompanied with an interdiction for Jewish actors to play anywhere else in Romania, as such the creation of the theatre being a purge of all Jewish people from all theatres across the country. In prison He was imprisoned for 20 years and he was never completely rehabilitated as a writer. His first years as a political prisoner began as soon as the Iron Guard lost their battle with Ion Antonescu. After spending time in prison, Radu Gyr was sent to fight on the Eastern Front, a form of punishment which was reserved for former Legionnaires. In 1958 he was sentenced to death by the Communist authorities because of his poem, considered subversive by the regime, \\"RidicƒÉ-te Gheorghe, ridicƒÉ-te Ioane!\\" (\\"Arise George, arise John!\\"). The poem asked for peasants and Romanians at large, given generic names, to rise against the communist dictatorial regime: it had been issued as the last wave of brutal collectivization was taking hold of rural Romania (a process which lasted between 1949‚Äì1962). It is primarily a poem pleading for freedom. Romanians, generically named George and John, are called upon to arise \\"not for bread, nor for land, but for their free air\\"; for their \\"nailed song\\" and \\"tears of an enchained sun\\"; for \\"a stack of horizons and a hatful of stars\\"; to \\"drink liberty out of well buckets\\", \\"swim in it as in heaven, and shake its cherry blossoms onto themselves\\". His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, but he served only six years, two of which (at Aiud Prison) with chains at his feet. Although severely ill (hepatitis, TBC, haemophilia, gangrened rectal prolapse), he was refused any medical assistance, was starved and tortured. Altogether he served 16 years in communist prisons (1945‚Äì1956; 1958‚Äì1964). In 1963‚Äì1964 all surviving political prisoners had to be released, upon pressure from the West. Collaboration with the Securitate After his release from prison in 1963 he was constantly tailed by the Romanian secret police, the Securitate. Convinced to use their expertise in ethnocracy, Radu Gyr and Nichifor Crainic wrote propaganda articles to Glasul Patriei (The Voice of the Motherland) ‚Äì later called Tribuna Rom√¢niei ‚Äì a newspaper published by the Securitate targeting exiled Romanians abroad.

It is located on the Esk Valley Line and is operated by Northern Trains who provide most of the station's passenger services. The NYMR use this station on gala days, when they run trains along the line as far as Battersby. The station dates from October 1865, when the Castleton to Grosmont line was opened. The signal box was moved northwards in June 1902 to allow the platform to be extended towards the west;engineers simply raised the box onto rails and slid the box into its new position. The station used to forward building stone, iron and ironstone. Three blast furnaces were located in the village which utilised two sidings built on the north side of the station with access from the east. The iron industry lasted until 1876, but the slag heaps were cleared sometime in the 1880s with the slag being sold to Surrey County Council. The station was host to a camping coach in 1933 and 1935, possibly one for some of 1934 and two coaches from 1936 to 1939, the station was also used as an overnight stop for touring camping coach service in 1935. Along with many other stations along the line (like and Grosmont), the station lost its goods facilities in August 1965. A passing loop is located here - one of only two remaining on the entire Esk Valley line. The signal box that once operated it can still be seen on the Whitby-bound platform, but the loop points now work automatically and the token machines for the single line block sections either side are operated by the train crew, under the remote supervision of the Nunthorpe signaller. Tokens are also available at the intermediate point of station; this allows for the North York Moors Railway to operate on the single line section between Grosmont and in parallel with the Northern service. Trains only normally cross here on summer Sundays, as the weekday timetable sees only one DMU on the branch at any one time. In May 2018, the Community Rail Partnership for the Esk Valley Line opened new public toilets on the station. Services Following the September 2020 timetable change, Glaisdale is served by six trains per day (four on Sunday) towards Whitby, and six trains per day (four on Sunday) towards Nunthorpe and Middlesbrough.

These are mechanisms defined under the Kyoto Protocol intended to lower the overall costs of achieving its emissions targets. These mechanisms enable Parties to achieve emission reductions or to remove carbon from the atmosphere cost-effectively in other countries. While the cost of limiting emissions varies considerably from region to region, the benefit for the atmosphere is in principle the same, wherever the action is taken.. Much of the negotiations on the mechanisms has been concerned with ensuring their integrity. There was concern that the mechanisms do not confer a \\"right to emit\\" on Annex 1 Parties or lead to exchanges of fictitious credits which would undermine the Protocol‚Äôs environmental goals. The negotiators of the Protocol and the Marrakesh Accords therefore sought to design a system that fulfilled the cost-effectiveness promise of the mechanisms, while addressing concerns about environmental integrity and equity. To participate in the mechanisms, Annex 1 Parties must meet the following eligibility requirements: #They must have ratified the Kyoto Protocol. #They must have calculated their assigned amount, as referred to in Articles 3.7 and 3.8 and Annex B of the Protocol in terms of tonnes of CO2-equivalent emissions. #They must have in place a national system for estimating emissions and removals of greenhouse gases within their territory. #They must have in place a national registry to record and track the creation and movement of Emission Reduction Units, Certified Emission Reductions, Assigned amount units and Removal Units (RMU)s and must annually report such information to the secretariat. #They must annually report information on emissions and removals to the secretariat. Emissions trading (ET) The Emissions Trading-mechanism allows parties to the Kyoto Protocol to buy 'Kyoto units'(emission permits for greenhouse gas) from other countries to help meet their domestic emission reduction targets. Project-based mechanisms The Protocol defines two project-based mechanisms that allow Annex I countries to meet their GHG emission reduction commitments by acquiring GHG emission reductions \\"credits.\\" The credits are acquired by an Annex I country financing projects that reduce emissions in non-Annex I countries or other Annex I countries, or by purchasing credits from Annex I countries with excess credits. The project-based mechanisms are the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI). The project-based mechanisms allow Annex I countries with efficient, low GHG-emitting industries, and high prevailing environmental standards to purchase carbon credits on the world market instead of reducing greenhouse gas emissions domestically. Annex I countries typically will want to acquire carbon credits as cheaply as possible, while non-Annex I countries want to maximize the value of carbon credits generated from their domestic greenhouse gas reducing projects. Joint Implementation (JI) Through the Joint Implementation, any Annex I country can invest in emission reduction projects (referred to as \\"Joint Implementation Projects\\") in any other Annex I country as an alternative to reducing emissions domestically. Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) Through the CDM, countries can meet their domestic emission reduction targets by buying greenhouse gas reduction units from (projects in) non Annex I countries to the Kyoto protocol (mostly developing countries). Non-Annex I countries have no GHG emission restrictions, but have financial incentives to develop GHG emission reduction projects to receive Certified Emission Reductions that can then be sold to Annex I countries, encouraging sustainable development.Only CDM Executive Board-accredited Certified Emission Reductions (CER) can be bought and sold in this manner. Under the aegis of the UN, Kyoto established this Bonn-based Clean Development Mechanism Executive Board to assess and approve projects (\\"CDM Projects\\") in non-Annex I countries prior to awarding CERs. Carbon market Kyoto provides for a 'cap and trade' system which imposes national caps on the emissions of annex I countries. On average, this cap requires countries to reduce their emissions by 5.2% below their 1990 baseline over the 2008 to 2012 period. Although these caps are national-level commitments, in practice, most countries will devolve their emissions targets to individual industrial entities, such as a power plant or paper factory. One example of a 'cap and trade' system is the 'EU ETS'. Other schemes may follow suit in time. The ultimate buyers of credits are often individual companies that expect emissions to exceed their quota, their assigned allocation units, AAUs or 'allowances' for short. Typically, they will purchase credits directly from another party with excess allowances, from a broker, from a JI/CDM developer, or on an exchange. National governments, some of whom may not have devolved responsibility for meeting Kyoto obligations to industry, and that have a net deficit of allowances, will buy credits for their own account, mainly from JI/CDM developers. These deals are occasionally done directly through a national fund or agency, as in the case of the Dutch government's ERUPT programme, or via collective funds such as the World Bank‚Äôs Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF). The PCF, for example, represents a consortium of six governments and 17 major utility and energy companies on whose behalf it purchases credits. Since allowances and carbon credits are tradeable instruments with a transparent price, financial investors can buy them on the spot market for speculation purposes, or link them to futures contracts. A high volume of trading in this secondary market helps price discovery and liquidity, and in this way helps to keep down costs and set a clear price signal in CO2 which helps businesses to plan investments. This market has grown substantially, with banks, brokers, funds, arbitrageurs and private traders now participating in a market valued at about $60 billion in 2007.Point Carbon Market news Emissions Trading PLC, for example, was floated on the London Stock Exchange's AIM market in 2005 with the specific remit of investing in emissions instruments. Although Kyoto created a framework and a set of rules for a global carbon market, there are in practice several distinct schemes or markets in operation today, with varying degrees of linkages among them. Kyoto enables a group of several annex I countries to create a market-within-a-market together. The EU elected to be treated as such a group, and created the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The EU ETS uses EAUs (EU Allowance Units), each equivalent to a Kyoto AAU. The scheme went into operation on 1 January 2005, although a forward market has existed since 2003. The UK established its own learning-by-doing voluntary scheme, the UK ETS, which ran from 2002 through 2006. This market existed alongside the EU's scheme, and participants in the UK scheme have the option of applying to opt out of the first phase of the EU ETS, which lasts through 2007. The sources of Kyoto credits are the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI) projects. The CDM allows the creation of new carbon credits by developing emission reduction projects in non-annex I countries, while JI allows project-specific credits to be converted from existing credits within annex I countries. CDM projects produce Certified Emission Reductions (CERs), and JI projects produce Emission Reduction Units (ERUs), each equivalent to one AAU. Kyoto CERs are also accepted for meeting EU ETS obligations, and ERUs will become similarly valid from 2008 for meeting ETS obligations (although individual countries may choose to limit the number and source of CER/JIs they will allow for compliance purposes starting from 2008). CERs/ERUs are overwhelmingly bought from project developers by funds or individual entities, rather than being exchange-traded like allowances. Since the creation of Kyoto is subject to a lengthy process of registration and certification by the UNFCCC, and the projects themselves require several years to develop, this market is at this point largely a forward market where purchases are made at a discount to their equivalent currency, the EUA, and are almost always subject to certification and delivery (although up-front payments are sometimes made). According to IETA, the market value of CDM/JI credits transacted in 2004 was EUR 245 m; it is estimated that more than EUR 620 m worth of credits were transacted in 2005. Several non-Kyoto carbon markets are in existence or being planned, and these are likely to grow in importance and numbers in the coming years. These include the New South Wales Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative and Western Climate Initiative in the United States and Canada, the Chicago Climate Exchange and the State of California‚Äôs recent initiative to reduce emissions. These initiatives taken together may create a series of partly linked markets, rather than a single carbon market. The common theme is the adoption of market-based mechanisms centered on carbon credits that represent a reduction of CO2 emissions. The fact that some of these initiatives have similar approaches to certifying their credits makes it possible that carbon credits in one market may in the long run be tradeable in other schemes. The scheme would broaden the current carbon market far more than the current focus on the CDM/JI and EU ETS domains. An obvious precondition, however, is a realignment of penalties and fines to similar levels, since these create an effective ceiling for each market. Views on the flexibility mechanisms As stated in the lede, one of the main arguments made in favour of the flexibility mechanisms is that of cost-effectiveness. Toth et al. summarize the arguments for and against flexibility: , in The principle of cost- effectiveness is included in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). , in The economic basis of costs being reduced through flexibility is discussed in emissions trading#Applying the economic theory and economics of climate change mitigation#Flexibility. A number of concerns were raised about flexibility in the lead-up to negotiations of the Kyoto Protocol. , in Two examples of issues raised were that of domestic emissions reductions in the developed countries, and the issue of developed countries effectively taking up all the low-cost emissions reductions in developing countries. , in The idea behind the first view was that most emissions reductions should occur first in the developed countries - this would encourage the development of low-carbon energy technologies which could then be taken up later on by developing counties. The second idea was that all of the low-cost emissions reductions in developing countries would, in effect, be stolen by the developed countries. Thus, when it came time for developing countries to take on their own commitments to reduce emissions, it would be more costly for them to do so. Differing views on flexibility were summarized in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Second Assessment Report. , in The basic economic argument in favour of flexibility was that, in principle at least, issues to do with fairness (\\"equity\\" in the language of economics) could be separated from efficiency (i.e., reducing emissions most cheaply). , in From this viewpoint, flexibility through emissions trading could promote efficiency, while arguments of equity could be partially addressed through, for example, the allocations of emissions rights between different countries. Halsn√¶s et al. (2007) highlight some of the flaws in this argument: , in also contains a critique of carbon trading. During negotiations, the US was a supporter of flexibility, while several other negotiating parties were in favour of uniform emissions cuts (e.g., the Alliance of Small Island States, ASIS). In the end, flexibility was incorporated into Kyoto's design, but the treaty still places an emphasis on developed countries achieving the bulk of their emissions reductions domestically, rather than in developing countries (i.e., by using the Clean Development Mechanism, CDM). The balance between domestic emissions reductions in developed countries and reductions through the CDM is not, however, quantified. Issues raised since implementation Since the implementation of the flexibility mechanisms, a number of other concerns have been raised. There have been various criticisms of the CDM (see Clean Development Mechanism for details). These include excess profits generated by CDM projects designed to reduce emissions of industrial gases, adverse effects of projects on local communities, . Note: when viewed on-line, the page referred to (306) is found on page 308. and the failure of the CDM to promote development in the poorest regions of the world. Criticisms have also been made of the various emissions trading schemes set-up by developed countries to meet their first-round Kyoto targets.e.g., Newbery (2009) was critical of the EU Emissions Trading System, which, in its first-phase, generated windfall profits for electric utilities: These criticisms are discussed in the individual articles on these trading schemes: see Kyoto Protocol#International Emissions Trading for a list of these trading schemes. For example, the environmental organization Friends of the Earth (EWNI) has called for the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) to be scrapped, and be replaced by other policies (e.g., energy efficiency standards), which they argue would be more effective than the EU ETS at reducing emissions. The articles referred to above also contain policy measures proposed by governments and commentatorse.g., see: to address some of these criticisms. Future The second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ends in 2020. Due to this, negotiations are underway to have the role of Flexible Mechanisms continue in some form under the Paris_Agreement. All though not yet worked out (at the moment of writing; november 2016), This should be possible as both article 5 and 6 call for a similar mechanism to be created.

Brereton recorded the first European exploration of Cape Cod and its environs. His account, published in 1602, helped promote the possibilities of English colonisation in what was then known as \\"the North part of Virginia\\" and would later become known as New England. Life Twentieth century historians such as Gookin and Quinn have identified John Brereton as a clergyman who was born and lived in East Anglia. The son of Cuthbert Brereton, a sheriff of Norwich, he was born around 1571/72 and was educated at Norwich School, before being admitted as a pensioner at Gonville & Caius College, Cambridge aged seventeen on 17 January 1589. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1593, and proceeded to Master of Arts by seniority in 1596. He took holy orders, being ordained deacon priest by the Bishop of Norwich and in 1598 was appointed curate of Lawshall, Suffolk. It was probably through this appointment in Suffolk that Brereton came into contact with Gosnold, who lived nearby, and also with the notable Elizabethan author, Richard Hakluyt, who had published numerous accounts of travels and voyages of discovery, especially in America. With Gosnold, Brereton undertook a voyage to Virginia, as it then was. On his return to England and after the publication of his account, he appears to have lived a quiet life in holy orders, becoming Rector of Brightwell, Suffolk, in 1619, and probably he is the same man who became Rector of St Peter Mancroft in Norwich and who died in 1632. The voyage and exploration of New England Brereton joined Captain Bartholomew Gosnold, Bartholomew Gilbert, Gabriel Archer, and others to make the first English attempt to settle in the land since called New England. Twenty-four gentlemen and eight sailors left Falmouth in a small Dartmouth bark, the Concord, on 26 March 1602, twelve of the gentlemen intending to settle, while twelve others were to return home with the produce of the land and of their trading with the natives. Instead of making the circuitous route by the Canary Islands, Gosnold steered, as the winds permitted, due west, only southing towards the Azores, and was the first to accomplish a direct course to America, saving the better part of a thousand leagues. By 15 May the voyagers made the headland which they named Cape Cod. Here Gosnold, Brereton, and two others went ashore on the white sands, the first spot in New England ever trodden by English feet. Doubling the Cape and passing Nantucket, they touched at Martha's Vineyard, and passing round Dover Cliff entered Buzzard's Bay, which they called Gosnold's Hope, reached the island of Cuttyhunk, which they named Elizabeth's Island. Expedition's fort on Elizabeth's IslandHere they determined to settle; in nineteen days they built a fort and storehouse in an islet in the centre of a lake of three miles compass, and began to trade with the natives in furs, skins, and the sassafras plant. They sowed wheat, barley, and peas, and in fourteen days the young plants had sprung nine inches and more. The country was fruitful in the extreme. It was decided, however, that so small a company would be useless for colonisation; their provisions, after division, would have lasted only six weeks. The whole company therefore sailed for England, making a very short voyage of five weeks, and landed at Exmouth on 23 July. Their freight realised a great profit, the sassafras alone selling for ¬£336 a ton. The published account Brereton wrote A Briefe Relation of the Description of Elizabeth's Ile, and some others towards the North Part of Virginie, written by John Brierton, one of the Voyage, which was published in London in 1602. A second impression was published the same year entitled A brief and true Relation of the Discovery of the North Part of Virginia, written by John Brereton, one of the Voyage. To this edition is added A Treatise of M. Edward Hayes, containing important inducements for the planting in these parts.'' Brereton's well- written and concise account was designed to promote the possibilities of colonisation of New England. There were no fewer than twenty three Atlantic crossings in nine separate voyages by one or two ships over the next six years. Captain John Smith, in his Adventures and Discourses, speaks of Master John Brereton and his account of his voyage as fairly turning his brains, and impelling him to cast in his lot with Gosnold and Wingfield, and make that subsequent voyage which resulted in the planting and colonisation of Virginia in 1607.

He started his career as Junior Hanson with the band Hanson in 1973. Marvin has also been associated with Gass, Keef Hartley Band, Toots & the Maytals and Steve Winwood. Biography Born in Kingston, Surrey County, Jamaica, Marvin moved to London as a child, where his love of both acting and music was nurtured. He appeared in the Beatles' film Help!, which was followed by a number of other television appearances. Meanwhile, Marvin served his musical apprenticeship in America by playing with the likes of Blues Legend T-Bone Walker and Ike & Tina Turner. Back in England he played with bands such as Herbie Goins & The Nighttimers, Blue Ace Unit and White Rabbit. In 1973 Marvin formed the band Hanson and recorded two albums. Marvin met Bob Marley on 14 February 1977 and joined Bob Marley and The Wailers. After the death of Bob Marley in 1981, Marvin along with the remaining Wailers members formed The Wailers Band and released the albums ID, Majestic Warriors, JAH Message, and Live 95‚Äì97 My Friends. In 1997, Marvin left The Wailers Band and relocated to Brazil, where he formed a short- lived group called Batuka. Following his departure from Brazil, Marvin worked as a session musician for Kaliroots and The Wailers Band. In 2007, Marvin recorded a solo album entitled Wailin' For Love. In 2008, Marvin formed along with Al Anderson The Original Wailers and toured with them until 2011. After departing from The Original Wailers, Marvin returned to solo work. Marvin left The Wailers Band in September 2018.

It is most frequently found on dead but attached and on recently fallen branches, especially of angiosperms, as a parasite of wood decay fungi in the genus Peniophora. The gelatinous, orange-yellow fruit body of the fungus, which can grow up to diameter, has a convoluted or lobed surface that is greasy or slimy when damp. It grows in crevices in bark, appearing during rainy weather. Within a few days after rain it dries into a thin film or shriveled mass capable of reviving after subsequent rain. This fungus occurs widely in deciduous and mixed forests and is widely distributed in temperate and tropical regions that include Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, North and South America. Although considered bland and flavorless, the fungus is edible. Tremella mesenterica produces carbohydrates that are attracting research interest because of their various biological activities. Taxonomy and phylogeny The species was originally described from Sweden as Helvella mesenterica by the naturalist Anders Jahan Retzius in 1769. It was later (1822) sanctioned by Elias Magnus Fries in the second volume of his Systema Mycologicum. It is the type species of the genus Tremella. Its distinctive appearance has led the species to accumulate a variety of common names, including \\"yellow trembler\\", \\"yellow brain\\", \\"golden jelly fungus\\", and \\"witches' butter\\", although this latter name is also applied to Exidia glandulosa. The specific epithet is a Latin adjective formed from the Ancient Greek word ŒºŒµœÉŒµŒΩœÑŒµœÅŒπŒøŒΩ (mesenterion), \\"middle intestine\\", from ŒºŒµœÉŒø- (meso-, \\"middle, center\\") and ŒµŒΩœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ (enteron, \\"intestine\\"), referring to its shape. The species formerly recognized as Tremella lutescens is now seen as a form of T. mesenterica with washed-out colors and considered a synonym. Based on molecular analysis of the sequences of the D1/D2 regions of the large subunit ribosomal RNA gene and the internal transcribed spacer regions of rRNA, T. mesenterica is most closely related to T. coalescens, T. tropica, and T. brasiliensis. This analysis included 20 of the estimated 120 Tremella species. Description The fruit body has an irregular shape, and usually breaks through the bark of dead branches. It is up to broad and high, rounded to variously lobed or brain-like in appearance. The fruit body is gelatin-like but tough when wet, and hard when dry. The surface is usually smooth, the lobes translucent, deep yellow or bright yellow-orange, fading to pale yellow, rarely unpigmented and white or colorless. The fruit bodies dry to a dark reddish or orange. The spores, viewed in mass, are whitish or pale yellow. Microscopic characteristics The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are ellipsoid to roughly spherical in shape, not or rarely stalked, and typically 15‚Äì21 ¬µm wide. They contain two to four septa that divide it into compartments; the septa are most frequently diagonal or vertical. Asexual reproduction in T. mesenterica is carried out through the formation of spores called conidia, which arise from conidiophores‚Äîspecialized hyphal cells that are morphologically distinct from the somatic hyphae. The conidiophores are densely branched and normally abundant in the hymenium; young specimens may be entirely conidial. The conidia are roughly spherical, ovoid, or ellipsoid, and about 2.0‚Äì3.0 by 2.0‚Äì2.5 ¬µm. They may be so numerous that young fruit bodies may be covered in a bright yellow, conidial slime. The spores are broadly ellipsoid to oblong, on average 10.0‚Äì16.0 by 6.0‚Äì9.5 ¬µm; they germinate by germ tube or by yeast-like conidia of identical form to the conidia produced on the conidiophores. Edibility Although some have claimed the fungus to be inedible or merely \\"non-poisonous\\", most other sources agree that it is edible but flavorless. The gelatinous to rubbery consistency lends texture to soups. In China, the fungus is used by vegetarians to prepare \\"an immunomodulating cooling soup with lotus seed, lily bulbs, jujube, etc.\\" Similar species Tremella mesenterica is frequently confused with Tremella aurantia, a widespread species parasitic on the plant pathogenic fungus Stereum hirsutum. Tremella aurantia can often be recognized by the presence of its host, which typically grows on logs, stumps, and trunks. Though the two species are similarly colored, the surface of T. aurantia is usually matte, not greasy or shiny, and its lobes or folds are thicker than those of T. mesenterica. Fruit bodies of T. aurantia contain unclamped, thick-walled host hyphae and consequently retain their shape when dried, rather than shriveling or collapsing to a film (as in T. mesenterica). Microscopically, T. aurantia has smaller basidia and smaller, differently shaped spores measuring 8.5‚Äì10 by 7‚Äì8.5 ¬µm. T. brasiliensis, known from neotropical areas and Japan, and the North American species T. mesenterella are also similar. Tremella mesenterica may also be confused with members of the family Dacrymycetaceae, like Dacrymyces chrysospermus (formerly D. palmatus), due to their superficial resemblance. Microscopic examination shows that the Dacrymycetaceae have Y-shaped basidia with two spores, unlike the longitudinally split basidia characteristic of Tremella; additionally, D. chrysospermus is smaller, has a whitish attachment point to its substrate, and grows on conifer wood. Life cycle Tremella mesenterica has a yeastlike phase in its life cycle that arises as a result of budding of basidiospores. The alternation between asexual and sexual propagation is achieved by mating of yeast-form haploid cells of two compatible mating types. Each mating type secretes a mating pheromone that elicits sexual differentiation of the target cell having the opposite mating type to the pheromone-producing cell. The sexual differentiation is characterized by the arrest of the growth in the G1 phase of the cell division cycle and subsequent formation of an elongated mating tube. Formation of the mating tube, initiated by the pheromones A-10 and a-13, is similar to the process of bud emergence during bipolar budding in yeasts. Tremerogen A-10 has been purified and its chemical structure found to be S-polyisoprenyl peptide. Fruit bodies arise from a primordium located beneath the wood bark, and sometimes more than one fruit body can originate separately from the same primordia. Habitat and distribution habit Tremella mesenterica has a cosmopolitan distribution, having been recorded from Europe, North, Central, and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. Fruit bodies are formed during wet periods throughout the year. In British Columbia, Canada, it is sometimes found on maple, poplar, or pine, but is most abundant on red alder. It prefers to grow in habitats ranging from mesic to wet. The fungus grows parasitically on the mycelium of wood-rotting corticioid fungi in the genus Peniophora. Occasionally, T. mesenterica and its host fungus are found fruiting together. Bioactive compounds Some Tremella species produce polysaccharides that are of interest to the medical field, because of their biological activity; several patents have been filed in China pertaining to the use of these compounds for cancer prevention or immune system enhancement. In 1966, Slodki reported discovering an acidic polysaccharide from haploid cells of T. mesenterica that closely resembled those produced by the species Cryptococcus laurentii. The structural similarity of the polysaccharides from the two species suggested a phylogenetic relationship between them. Subsequently, researchers chemically synthesized the polysaccharide, and determined the chemical identities of the component sugar units. The polysaccharide, known as glucuronoxylomannan‚Äîproduced by fruit bodies and in pure culture conditions‚Äîhas been shown to consist of a mannan backbone that is glycosylated with xylan chains in a regular repeating structure. Laboratory tests have associated a number of biological activities with T. mesenterica glucuronoxylomannan, including immunostimulatory,antidiabetic, anti- inflammatory, hypocholesterolemic, hepatoprotective, and antiallergic effects.

It has predominantly yellow plumage with a green tail. The bird is found primarily in eucalyptus groves and other wooded areas of subtropical southwestern Australia, as well as in a smaller area of subtropical and temperate southeastern Australia. Seeds make up the bulk of its diet. Taxonomy A species of Psittaculidae, allied to the tribe Polytelini, a sister taxon to Polytelis swainsonii, the superb parrot, and P. alexandrae, the princess parrot. The epithet anthopeplus is derived from ancient Greek, a compound of anthos, flower, and peplos, robe. There are two populations, morphologically similar though isolated, within the species distribution range of Southern Australia. These are described as subspecies: *Polytelis anthopeplus anthopeplus, Southwest Australia *Polytelis anthopeplus monarchoides Schodde, 1993. Southeast Australia author of the first description. The regent parrot was first depicted by English author and artist Edward Lear in 1831. Lear included two images in Illustrations of the family of Psittacidae, or parrots, an early folio of lithographs with brief captions. The first plate reproduced a female specimen, given the title Pal√¶ornis anthopeplus (1831), the second was a male, Pal√¶ornis melanura (pt. 12, 1832), drawn by Lear in England. The regional origin of the parrots, presented as two species, is not supplied in the work, so the type specimen or locality for each was not formally nominated and assumed to be lost. A 1912 review by G. M. Mathews stated the source of the specimens was New South Wales, and occurred in a range that excluded the Southwest of the country. When correcting this omission, Mathews proposed the taxa named anthopeplus and melanura in Lear's folio was only found in the east and that the southwest population was a new taxon, nominated westralis. The arrangement and typification of the geographically separate groups was largely ignored by authors, until Richard Schodde published a conclusion that the origin of both Lear's specimens were from a Western Australian population, based on differences in colouration of the female plumage which he observed in the plates. Further evidence was provided by examining any possible collection and transport of the species to England, living or skinned, a possible holotype held at the Liverpool Museum, and comparison other collected data. Subsequently, the nominate subspecies of the West became P. a. anthopeplus and the eastern isolate was given a neotype and assigned to subspecies P. anthopeplus monarchoides. A female (left) and male (right) in Wyperfeld National Park, Australia The parrot is also known variously as the rock pebbler, rock peplar, Murray smoker, Marlock parakeet, yellow king-parrot and regent parakeet. Lear's illustrations are captioned with Blossom-feathered Parrakeet to Pal√¶ornis anthopeplus and Black-tailed Parrakeet to P. melanura.Lear, E. Illustrations of the family of Psittacidae, or parrots. Plates 28, 29. The indigenous names for the southwest subspecies in the Nyungar language, noted by Dom Serventy, include Waukanga and Wouk-un-ga, and Walkinger recorded at Avon River. A recommended orthography and pronunciation list of the region's bird names has proposed the adoption of common names yalop [yaw‚Äôlawp] and wookonga [woo‚Äôkawng‚Äôa] for this subspecies. Description A yellowish-green parrot, long and slender, with similar patterning exhibited by the sexes. They are between 14¬Ω-16¬Ω\\" (37-42 cm) in length and weigh four ounces. The female is generally more green, the male much yellower. The tail feathers above are dark blue-green, those beneath are black. The male is generally yellow, with several shades on the head; its back is generally a collection of colorful shades of green; its beak generally red. Immature birds, like the female, are duller in colour than males. Behaviour A social bird, found in pairs or joining up to twenty others in flocks. The southwest subspecies, where it is common to abundant, may occur in mobs of up to one hundred birds. This produces an attractive spectacle when in flight. The movement in flight is fast and erratic, though described as graceful, with swept back wings. Feeding Most feeding activity is on the ground, foraging for grass seed. They also seek seed and blossoms in the limbs of trees, usually acacia and eucalypt species. Their diet also includes fruit, leaf buds and nuts of native species. The western subspecies has adapted to feed on fruits and wheat, or other cereals, introduced throughout the range after European settlement of the region. Reproduction Juvenile at Walk- in Aviary, Canberra, Australia Male at Symbio Wildlife Park, Australia Nesting is ast the base of a tree hollow of great depth, up to fifteen feet within the main stem of the plant. The site is usually a large eucapylpt, with a hollow in the trunk that may reach almost to ground level, where the female lays around four eggs. The female broods 3-8 eggs for approximately 21 days. During this period she seldom departs from the nest, if at all, and is fed by the male. When the young have hatched, they are cared for by both the male and female. During this period, they can be fed several times their normal portion of feed, which they readily convey to their young. The young begin to fly at about 5 weeks. Sexual maturity is reached at about 2 years of age. Conservation While the western subspecies (P. anthopeplus anthopeplus) is listed as \\"lower risk\\" or \\"least concern\\", the eastern subspecies (P. anthopeplus monarchoides) is listed as vulnerable under the Australian Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. A recovery plan for the subspecies was published in 2011. The bird is regarded as an agricultural pest in Western Australia.  Captivity  The species is traded as an aviary bird, referred to as the rock pebbler or regents parrot, the bird should only be acquired by experienced handlers and placed is free flying aviaries. They are not suitable for the inexperienced carer or as pets. Captive regent parrots thrive on chopped mixtures for large parrots. They also like eggfood, fruit, sprouting seeds and a small assortment of insects. Unlike most birds parrots do not require grit in their diet, grit should only be given when a certified avian veterinarian prescribes it for digestion aid if the bird is ill. An occasional fresh willow or fruit tree branch to \\"spruce up\\" their quarters seems to please the birds. The regent parrot is naturally hardy, so being careful to protect them from drafts and the like is unnecessary. However, they should be protected from excessive cold, as such is uncommon in their natural habitat.

Parlaman was born in Los Angeles County, California, to Griffith Mead Parlaman (20 April 1923 - 22 October 1991) and Doris V. Simmons Parlaman (22 November 1923 - 11 February 2007); he fell to his death in Jomtien, Pattaya, Thailand. Parlaman created websites to represent his projects, such as the now-defunct capcat.org. Beginnings During his time in college he was able to secure government grants, to become a member of the Oregon steering committee of the 2000 Green Party Presidential campaign of Ralph Nader, and to get permission from Stephen King to make Stud City, a short, independent sequel to Stand by Me. Activism Mr. Parlaman moved to Thailand and continued his activism. For example, Mr. Parlaman wrote: \\"At an age when we would regard them as still being children, over a thousand young girls from northern Thailand are being lured every year into prostitution. Girls, as young as 10, are being sold to the brothels of Bangkok, other Thai cities and overseas.\\" However, despite his efforts to raise awareness of local establishments' engaging in child prostitution, he was accused by those same institutions of being a pedophile himself, as was a common retaliatory tactic to quickly eliminate pesky activists. On 30 September 2002, living in Thailand, Parlaman was charged with molesting a 12-year-old boy, but released on bail by the local magistrate due to lack of evidence, as the sole incriminating evidence against him was a bruise on the boy's neck.Foreign resident falls to his death from 15th floor of condo.

Instead, he jumped, fell, or was thrown to the street from his apartment building in the city of Pattaya, thereby closing the applicable case. Mr. Parlaman was pronounced dead on the scene.Obituaries: Sean Parlaman. Ashland Daily Tidings. Controversies Sean Parlaman had a feud with Don't! Buy! Thai! accusing their campaigners of being fundamentalist Christians, right-wing bigots, and pedophiles. Don't! Buy! Thai! was a campaign initiated in the early 1990s by child welfare advocate and author Andrew Vachss to boycott goods and services produced in Thailand until its government introduced formal and practical reforms to significantly curtail the prostitution of children. Reactions to death Before moving to Thailand, he was a resident of Ashland, Oregon and an avid supporter of high school athletics. Joel Smith, a First Team All-State Linebacker on the high school football team that won the 1998 OSAA 4A State Championship team, is quoted as saying, in response to his death, that \\"his commitment to the community and unselfishness in public service is a beacon of light in Southern Oregon and, in my mind, remain unrivaled to this day. It cannot be exaggerated how much he will be missed by those who knew him best.\\" Karen Money Williams, writer, editor, and longtime friend in Ashland adds: \\"Sean had a quick wit, a huge heart, and a rare knowledge of contemporary culture--especially cinema and politics. To be in his presence was a joy, an inspiration, and a challenge to explore the world with gusto.\\"  References  Further reading  * ‚ÄúParlaman shines at martial arts challenge‚Äù, Jackson County, Oregon, Mail Tribune, 16 June 2000 * ‚ÄúForeign resident falls to his death from 15th floor of condo‚Äù, Pattaya Mail, 29 November 2002 (Derivative story: ‚ÄúFarang falls to his death from 15th floor of condo‚Äù, Farang News, 29 November 2002) * ‚ÄúObituaries: Sean Parlaman\\" Ashland Daily Tidings * * promotional page for Sean Parlaman at StephenKingShortMovies.com * promotional page for Stud City at StephenKingShortMovies.com * ** (These include .) * ‚ÄúSteve Duin Fabrication‚Äù by Lou Bank at The Zero (Andrew Vachss' site) * * ‚ÄúElection Results‚Äù, Medford Mail Tribune, March 1999.

The use of log probabilities means representing probabilities on a logarithmic scale, instead of the standard [0, 1] unit interval. Since the probability of independent events multiply, and logarithms convert multiplication to addition, log probabilities of independent events add. Log probabilities are thus practical for computations, and have an intuitive interpretation in terms of information theory: the negative of the log probability is the information content of an event. Similarly, likelihoods are often transformed to the log scale, and the corresponding log-likelihood can be interpreted as the degree to which an event supports a statistical model. The log probability is widely used in implementations of computations with probability, and is studied as a concept in its own right in some applications of information theory, such as natural language processing. Motivation Representing probabilities in this way has several practical advantages: # Speed. Since multiplication is more expensive than addition, taking the product of a high number of probabilities is often faster if they are represented in log form. (The conversion to log form is expensive, but is only incurred once.) Multiplication arises from calculating the probability that multiple independent events occur: the probability that all independent events of interest occur is the product of all these events' probabilities. # Accuracy. The use of log probabilities improves numerical stability, when the probabilities are very small, because of the way in which computers approximate real numbers. # Simplicity. Many probability distributions have an exponential form. Taking the log of these distributions eliminates the exponential function, unwrapping the exponent. For example, the log probability of the normal distribution's probability density function is -(x-m_x/\\\\sigma_m)^2+C instead of C_2 \\\\exp(-(x-m_x/\\\\sigma_m)^2). Log probabilities make some mathematical manipulations easier to perform.  Representation issues  The logarithm function is not defined for zero, so log probabilities can only represent non-zero probabilities. Since the logarithm of a number in (0, 1) interval is negative, often the negative log probabilities are used. In that case the log probabilities in the following formulas would be inverted. Any base can be selected for the logarithm. : x' = \\\\log(x) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} : y' = \\\\log(y) \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}  Basic manipulations  The product of probabilities x \\\\cdot y corresponds to addition in logarithmic space. : \\\\log(x \\\\cdot y) = \\\\log(x) + \\\\log(y) = x' + y'. The sum of probabilities x + y is a bit more involved to compute in logarithmic space, requiring the computation of one exponent and one logarithm. However, in many applications a multiplication of probabilities (giving the probability of all independent events occurring) is used more often than their addition (giving the probability of at least one of them occurring). Additionally, the cost of computing the addition can be avoided in some situations by simply using the highest probability as an approximation. Since probabilities are non-negative this gives a lower bound. This approximation is used in reverse to get a continuous approximation of the max function. Addition in log space : \\\\log(x + y) : = \\\\log(x + x \\\\cdot y / x) : = \\\\log(x + x \\\\cdot \\\\exp(\\\\log(y / x))) : = \\\\log(x \\\\cdot (1 + \\\\exp(\\\\log(y) - \\\\log(x)))) : = \\\\log(x) + \\\\log(1 + \\\\exp(\\\\log(y) - \\\\log(x))) : = x' + \\\\log(1 + \\\\exp(y' - x')) The formula above is more accurate than \\\\log(e^{x'} + e^{y'}), provided one takes advantage of the asymmetry in the addition formula. {x'} should be the larger (least negative) of the two operands. This also produces the correct behavior if one of the operands is floating-point negative infinity, which corresponds to a probability of zero. : -\\\\infty + \\\\log(1 + \\\\exp(y' - (-\\\\infty))) = -\\\\infty + \\\\infty This quantity is indeterminate, and will result in NaN. : x' + \\\\log(1 + \\\\exp(-\\\\infty - x')) = x' + 0 This is the desired answer. The above formula alone will incorrectly produce an indeterminate result in the case where both arguments are -\\\\infty . This should be checked for separately to return -\\\\infty . For numerical reasons, one should use a function that computes \\\\log(1+x) (log1p) directly.

Located at 2 Handy Road in the Museum Planning Area of Singapore, the building was most known for its air-conditioned theatre known as the Cathay Cinema, then a technological marvel and the first to be built in Singapore. Cathay Building was the first skyscraper in Singapore and tallest building in Southeast Asia at that time. History The supposed 16 storey (11 storey upon completion) Cathay Building was designed by British architect Frank W Brewer. The Cathay Building consisted of the Cathay Cinema, a restaurant and the dance hall on the ground floor, as well as a roof garden above the cinema and a residential storey block with a penthouse. The Cathay Cinema in 1945 The first part of the Cathay Building was opened on 3 October 1939 with the 1,300-seat Cathay Cinema, the dance hall and the Cathay Restaurant. On 1 July 1940, the 11 storey residential block was opened for occupancy, with the owners Mrs Loke Wan and Loke Wan Tho occupied the eleventh floor. The building was the first and tallest skyscraper in Singapore and in Southeast Asia, at a height of 83.5 metres from the Dhoby Ghaut entrance to the top of the building's water tower. Its theatre was the island's first air-conditioned cinema and public building, and where one could sit in an arm chair to watch a film; a rare amenity during that time. The building was also used as a landmark for final landing approach at Singapore's first purpose-built civilian airport, Kallang Airport. At the beginning of World War II in 1942, the building was converted to a Red Cross casualty station. When Singapore fell to the Japanese, it was used to house the Japanese Broadcasting Department, the Military Propaganda Department, the Military Information Bureau and the broadcast department of the Indian National Army's Provisional government of Free India during the occupation period. The Japanese utilised the building to broadcast propaganda in the Japanese language. It was also the residence of film director Yasujir≈ç Ozu from 1944 till the end of the war. When the war ended in 1945, it served as the headquarters for Admiral Lord Mountbatten while serving as the Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia Theatre of the South East Asia Command (SEAC). When the SEAC was disbanded a year later, the building was converted back to a cinema and a hotel. The cinema was the first to show American and British films in Singapore. A new air-conditioning plant was installed in the building in 1948. The colonial government vacated the building to be returned to the Cathay Organisation. The Cathay Restaurant was officially reopened on 1 May 1948 under the management of Cathay Restaurant Ltd. On 9 January 1954, the building reopened as Cathay Hotel with 60 rooms and subsequently expanded to 170 rooms. It had a restaurant, nightclub, swimming pool and shopping arcade. Cathay Hotel was closed on 30 December 1970, with the 10 floors had been converted into office premises and the top floor occupied by the Cathay Organisation by July 1974. The building was refaced in 1978 with a new look by STS Leong. The original design was shadowed by the new facade. Cathay Building was the location for the first Orange Julius outlet in Singapore, which opened in 1982. In 1990, Cathay Organisation opened Singapore's first arthouse cinema, The Picturehouse adjacent to Cathay Building. The main Cathay cinema was then converted into a two-hall cineplex during that period. Redevelopment and preservation In 1999, Cathay announced the S$100 million plans to redevelop the whole complex. Cathay Building and the Picturehouse would show its last movie in 2000 before closing for redevelopment. The front facade of its theatre building structure was gazetted as a national monument for conservation on 10 February 2003, while the rest of the building structure was later demolished. Thus the new building incorporated conservation of the original art-deco fa√ßade of the 1939 and combined together with a modern-day design by Paul Tange of Tange Associates Japan and RDC Architects Pte Ltd Singapore. The Cathay as it is currently known, was opened on 24 March 2006. The building houses retail, food & beverage outlets and an 8-screen Cathay Cineplex which includes The Picturehouse. The Cathay Residences opened towards the end of 2006.

It is located on the Esk Valley Line which serves one platform and is operated by Northern Trains who provide the station's passenger services. The Whitby and Pickering Railway built a line through Grosmont in 1835, and the present station was constructed in 1845, under York and North Midland Railway ownership. The main part of the station closed in 1965, and served trains to and from Pickering and Malton. It was re- opened in 1973 by the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, a heritage railway which operates passenger services between Whitby and Pickering. The station is also a stop on the Network Rail-owned Whitby to Middlesbrough Esk Valley Line. The station appeared several times in the television series Heartbeat. History In 1835 a railway was brought to Grosmont by the Whitby and Pickering Railway and its engineer George Stephenson. It was a horse-worked line and opened from Whitby as far as Grosmont (then known as 'Tunnel' from the tunnel required to pass from Grosmont towards Beckhole) in 1835. From 1900 to 1924 iron ore extraction resulted in the whole area under Grosmont station being mined, on the 'pillar and stall' method; the railway company (the NER) simply bought the ironstone under the station house and the river bridge and made preparations to deal with subsidence elsewhere. In 1845 the railway was sold to George Hudson's York and North Midland Railway (Y&NMR;); additional parliamentary powers were obtained (by the W&P;) to make various improvements to its alignment and to permit the introduction of steam power and the line was converted from single into a fully double track steam powered railway. The first steam engine entered Whitby in July 1847. At Grosmont a new wider tunnel and bridge were constructed, probably to designs of John Cass Birkinshaw, and a G.T. Andrews designed railway station was built, creating Grosmont's first true station. In 1854 the Y&NMR; was one of the three railway companies that came together to form the North Eastern Railway (NER). In 1865 a deviation line on the route to Pickering opened, to avoid the cable-worked incline at Beckhole; a new connection was made from to Grosmont (now part of the Esk Valley Line), making Grosmont into a junction. The NER built a short terrace of cottages just south of the tunnel; these were used by the NYMR to house volunteers from but were demolished in 1989 to allow extensions to its running shed and workshops. Two camping coaches were positioned here by the North Eastern Region from 1959 to 1964. The Grosmont to Malton line closed in March 1965, and was re-opened to Pickering as the heritage North Yorkshire Moors Railway in 1973. As of 2013 the line between Whitby and Middlesbrough via Castleton and Battersby is operated as the Esk Valley Line under the control of Network Rail. Services=Northern Trains Following the September 2020 timetable change, Grosmont is served by five trains per day (four on Sunday) towards Whitby, and six trains per day (four on Sunday) towards Nunthorpe and Middlesbrough.

History Sleights station was on the initial section of the Whitby and Pickering Railway between and . Originally just a simple halt, it opened to horse-drawn traffic on 15 May 1835, with a full public service operating from June 1835. The station platforms and the main building, a mock-Tudor design by George Townsend Andrews, were constructed eleven years later and opened in 1846. It used to have two platforms for up and down line working, but in common with the other stations between Grosmont and Whitby, this was reduced to single track working in 1984 when the second track was lifted and Sleights signal box closed. Trains now stop at the former Up line platform where the main station buildings, including the station master's house, are now a grade II listed private residence. The former down platform used to have a wooden waiting shed and store; this building was recovered by the North Yorkshire Moors Railway and re-erected on the extended down platform at Grosmont. Behind the down platform was a small goods yard with a single siding. The Up line platform is currently managed and maintained by Northern and Esk Valley Railway, whilst the down platform and derelict signal box are the responsibility of Network Rail. At one end of the platform, a footpath carries passengers over the River Esk to Briggswath on a small box girder bridge, while at the other the A169 towers over the railway and river on a bridge opened on 26 January 1937. The site of the modern day footpath used to be a level crossing carrying the main Whitby-Pickering road to a stone bridge over the Esk, before this was washed away during floods in 1930. Next to the crossing a 19th-century brick built signal box remains, now unused and boarded up.

History The line through Ruswarp was opened in June 1835, as the initial section of the Whitby and Pickering Railway between Whitby and . The station first appears in a timetable for May 1848, though it was used before that; in July 1835, over 1,000 people were carried between Pickering and Ruswarp for the Ruswarp Fair Day. The main railway building, which remains to this day and is now grade II listed, was designed by the architect G T Andrews and was built in 1850 at the request of the York and North Midland Railway who owned the line through acquisition. Immediately to the west of the station is an automatic barrier level crossing and a lattice-work iron bridge over the River Esk. The original Whitby and Pickering Railway bridge was made from Baltic pine and covered a distance of , crossing the river on a diagonal compared to its flow. The design of the station was similar to that at railway station, but with Tudor arches and Tudor chimneys. Behind the main station building was a three-road goods yard, with a connection facing towards Whitby. The yard was listed as forwarding flour and bran as it chief commodities - the village had a large mill powered by the river. A camping coach was positioned here by the North Eastern Region from 1959 to 1964. A second goods siding was located just across the river (on the south bank) with access to both directions of the running line. This was Sneathonthopre Siding and dealt mostly with cattle. Both goods sidings were closed in early August 1965. In the early 1980s, rationalisation of the Esk Valley Line led to the singling of the line between Grosmont and Whitby. The down line through the station was kept open, whilst the up line and platform were removed. The signal box was kept open as control for the level crossing until 1986 when it was automated.

It is the terminus of the Esk Valley Line from . The station is situated south-east of Middlesbrough and is operated by Northern Trains, which provides all of the station's National Rail passenger services. The station is also served during the summer months by the heritage North Yorkshire Moors Railway, whose line connects with the Esk Valley line at .  History  North Eastern Railway routes across North Yorkshire Whitby in the 1970s with all four platforms still in use Whitby's original railway station stood near to the end of the current platform, in the form of the offices, workshop and carriage shed of the Whitby and Pickering Railway; a single track horse worked line opened throughout in 1836. Its engineer was George Stephenson. In 1845, the W&P; was taken over by the York and North Midland Railway and converted into a double tracked, steam worked line. The Y&NM; built the present Whitby station to the design of its architect George Townsend Andrews, who also designed the locomotive shed and the goods shed (demolished to make way for a supermarket, although a German bomber made a start during the Second World War). Andrews' station included a fine 'Euston Truss' overall roof which was removed by British Railways in 1953 and replaced by the present awnings. In 1854, the Y&NM; helped form the North Eastern Railway, who later added two more platforms (also replaced by the supermarket) to help deal with traffic from the other branch lines that served Whitby; the Esk Valley Line finally opened throughout to a junction at in 1865. The coast line from opened in 1883 and from Scarborough in 1885. Block signalling replaced the time interval system in 1876 and brought Whitby an unusual three storey signal box to make it high enough to see over the adjacent goods shed. In 1900, the NER authorised the installation of Tile Maps at 25 of their stations. Whitby is one of nine stations left to have their map still in situ and intact. The other eight are at Beverley, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Morpeth, Saltburn, Scarborough, Tynemouth and . The NER became part of the London and North Eastern Railway at the grouping of the railways in 1923 and the LNER became part of British Railways with the nationalisation of the railways in 1948. The only changes brought to Whitby were in locomotives, rolling stock and signalling; the basic structure remained unchanged. With the publication of the Beeching Report in 1963, change hung over Whitby station and its railways; the report recommended closure of all three lines that still served Whitby (the fourth line going north up the coast had already closed in 1958). There was strong local resistance to the closure of the three lines but in the event only one line, that up the Esk Valley to Middlesbrough was saved. It may seem strange that Whitby's main line, the largely double tracked route to Pickering and Malton, with connections to York, was not the one to survive. Instead, the saviour of the Esk Valley Line were the steep and narrow roads to the villages that it served, making replacement bus services impractical, especially for bringing school children to and from school in Whitby. With the closure of all but the Esk Valley Line, Whitby lost almost all of its staff and in time the pickup goods train was withdrawn; the remaining double track as far as was singled and the signal box closed and later demolished, as was the goods shed. It was only a case put by an ex-Whitby signalman that allowed retention of a basic facility for running round loco-hauled trains, so as to allow for excursions. This run-round loop was used by the regular NYMR services from 2007 until 2014. Platforms 3 and 4 were entirely removed and the site sold off, to be occupied by a supermarket. Platform 2 was cut back to what remains of the trainshed and its track removed, leaving only platform 1 rail served. Apart from the roofless and truncated station, Whitby's only other surviving railway buildings are the two track engine shed, originally built by the York and North Midland Railway and extended by the NER and the neglected remains of one of the pair of Whitby and Pickering Railway 1835 weighbridge houses. In 2013, it was announced that an application for major development work around the station had been successful. This included the rebuilding and restoration of platform 2, to a somewhat longer length than the original. When the rebuilding of platform 2 was complete in 2014, the NYMR increased their service to four trains per day (five in peak periods) to and from Whitby. In December 2019, Northern increased their services from four trains per day to six.  Services  The station in 2017 with both platforms restored to use As of December 2019, six Northern Trains return services operate between Middlesbrough and Whitby, one of which continues along the Durham Coast Line to . Four trains operate on Sundays, two of which continue to Newcastle.Northern Timetable 5 - Middlesbrough to Whitby (Esk Valley Railway) 15 December 2019 - 16 May 2020 Northern, retrieved 21 November 2019 From April to early November, the heritage North Yorkshire Moors Railway runs services from Whitby to , running along the Esk Valley line to where they join the NYMR's own line. The NYMR's service consists of four or five arrivals and departures each day.

In chess he holds an International Master title. Biography Bern joined the Norwegian correspondence chess federation in 1986 and won the Norwegian correspondence chess championship in 1988. He became an International correspondence chess international master in 1991 and a correspondence chess Grandmaster in 1993. Qualification to the World Championship started with scoring 10¬Ω/16 giving him a third-place finish in a World championship semifinal lasting between 1989 and 1995. This qualified him for a spot in the 3/4 final, or candidate tournament where Bern finished fourth, again scoring 10¬Ω/16, giving him one of the last spots in the World championship. The World Championship started in March 2002 and is as of January 2006 still ongoing, but on January 7 it became clear that none of the other contestants could overtake Bern any longer. Bern has completed all his games, scoring 10¬Ω/16 in this tournament as well. Two other players have the same number of points as he does, but Bern has better tiebreak scores. The slowness of conventional postcards in the seventeenth championship led to the winner of the eighteenth World Championship, Joop van Oosterom being announced before Bern's victory in the seventeenth. Another performance was the second place in the 7th World Cup Final (started in 1994 and finished in 2001). In over-the-board chess Bern has won the Open Norwegian Championships three times, in 1986, 1989 and 1990. His best results in the more prestigious closed Norwegian Championship are third- place finishes in 1989 and 1990. He gained the title of International Master in 1992. Bern plays for the Bergen Chess Club, and has participated on the teams which won the Norwegian Team Championships in 1994, 1997, 1998, 2000 and 2003. Bern is the chess columnist for Bergens Tidende.

She sailed between Cape Town and Saint Helena with regular shuttles continuing to Ascension Island. Some voyages also served Walvis Bay en route to and from, or occasionally instead of, Cape Town. She visited Portland, Dorset twice a year with normal calls in the Spanish ports of Vigo (northbound) and Tenerife (southbound) until 14 October 2011, when she set sail on her final voyage from the English port. On 10 February 2018 she departed for her last trip from St Helena to Cape Town. At the time of her retirement from St Helena service she was one of only four ships in the world still carrying the status of Royal Mail Ship. Locals including local press have usually called her the RMS, in order not to confuse her with the island itself. In April 2018 she was purchased by MNG Maritime and renamed MNG Tahiti to act as a vessel-based armoury (VBA) licensed by the UK Department for International Trade (DIT) in the Gulf of Oman. In October 2018 MNG sold the ship and she returned to the UK renamed St Helena once more.  Background  Formerly, Saint Helena island was occasionally served by ships of the Union-Castle Line, which ran between the UK and South Africa. By the 1970s the number of ships taking this route had declined significantly and Union-Castle withdrew from the route completely at the end of 1977. As Saint Helena lacked an airfield, the British government had to purchase a ship to service the remote island and its dependencies from Cape Town. The British government purchased the part passenger, part cargo ship Northland Prince to fulfil the role of servicing Saint Helena, and after being refitted and renamed this became the first RMS St Helena. Originally built in 1963, this converted 3,150 ton ship had room to carry 76 passengers and supplies. The ship was used by the Royal Navy during the Falklands War as a minesweeper support ship. By the 1980s it was becoming apparent that the ship was too small for the island's needs, resulting in the new St Helena, built in 1989. The island lacks a port suitable for large ships, so the RMS anchored near the island, and loaded and unloaded cargo to and from lighters.  Characteristics  The new RMS St Helena was built by Hall, Russell & Company in Aberdeen, and entered service in 1990. St Helena was a British registered Class 1 passenger/cargo ship, and operated with 56 officers and crew. St Helena was equipped to carry a wide range of cargo, including liquids, to meet the needs of the population of Saint Helena. She also had berths for 155 passengers and associated facilities including a swimming pool, shop, and lounges. She also had well-equipped medical facilities and an on- board doctor. The ship's capacity was extended in 2012 by the addition of 24 extra cabin berths, and a new gym was installed. Some sources state that she had the nickname \\"Betty Blue Bucket\\". AW Ship Management had a package deal where passengers could travel in one direction on the RMS and in the other by taking British Royal Air Force flights to or from RAF Ascension Island and RAF Brize Norton in Brize Norton, England. By the 2010s many construction workers building the airport and South African tourists were passengers. The shipboard culture had been inherited from previous Union Castle lines although formality became relaxed in response to changes in the customer base.https://www.theoldie.co.uk/article/the-last-boat-to-st-helena When she converted to a vessel-based armoury in May 2018, a rigid inflatable boat davit was fitted on the port side, and additional bunks installed, taking the capacity to 30 crew and 250 passengers. In Cape Town in 2013  Incidents  In November 1999, St Helena broke down en route to the island and was forced into the French port of Brest to undergo repairs. Many people were left stranded on the island with no way in or out whilst the ship was being repaired. Panic-buying ensued as islanders became concerned about the non- delivery of vital supplies. This incident intensified calls for the island to be provided with an airport. On 25 August 2000, St Helena suffered a minor engine room fire while sailing from Cardiff to Tenerife on the first leg of her journey to the island. No one was injured and there was no significant damage. In March and April 2017 a number of Cape Town ‚Äì Saint Helena voyages were cancelled because of technical problems with the propellers, making the island isolated as the airport was still not operational.Voyage 255 Cancelled (8 March 2017)RMS St Helena Update (25 April 2017)  Recent history  In 2005 the British government announced plans to construct an airport on Saint Helena, which would lead to the withdrawal from service of the RMS St Helena. The airport was initially expected to be operational by 2010. However, it was not approved until October 2011, with work commencing in 2012. The estimated cost on the project is ¬£240 million and the airport was due to open in the first quarter of 2016. However, due to concerns about wind shear, on 26 April 2016 the St. Helena Government announced an indefinite postponement to the opening of Saint Helena Airport. RMS St Helena had been placed for disposal via London shipbrokers CW Kellock, but was subsequently restored to service. The voyage originally intended as her final one began on 14 June 2016 from the UK and ended on 15 July in Cape Town, calling at Tenerife, Ascension Island and St Helena. As part of its farewell voyage, Royal Mail organised a letter exchange with pupils from Cardiff and St Helena. However, due to the postponed opening of the airport, the schedule of RMS St Helena was extended as an interim measure. The ship was initially scheduled to run until July 2017, and then February 2018. After the opening of Saint Helena Airport to scheduled passenger flights on 14 October 2017, RMS St Helena was withdrawn from service, and her last sailing from St Helena Island was on 10 February 2018. Freight services for the Saint Helena island have been taken over by the MV Helena cargo ship,HELENA General Cargo IMO:9183491 marinetraffic.comhttp://sthelenashipping.com which does carry a limited number of passengers, and mail and other express freight by the passenger aircraft. The first passenger on the MV Helena stated that unlike the RMS St Helena, the new ship, with a lower capacity, is strictly geared towards cargo although some former RMS employees had become crew on the new ship. In April 2018, RMS was purchased by MNG Maritime and entered service as a vessel-based armoury in the Gulf of Oman named MNG Tahiti to supply weaponry to ships travelling through the High Risk Area of heightened pirate activity in the Indian Ocean. In October 2018 the vessel was resold to St Helena LLC, Jersey and in 2019 the ship will be refitted to act as a mobile hub for the race events of the Extreme E electric SUV racing series.St Helena Converted in Birkenhead Ships Monthly July 2019 page 6 References=NotesBibliography * * External links *RMS St. Helena homepage ** ** Deck Plans and brochure *Site monitoring airport progress on Saint Helena *MV Helena homepage *MNG Maritime homepage Category:Transport in Saint Helena Category:Transport in Ascension Island Category:Transport in Tristan da Cunha Category:Passenger ships of the United Kingdom Category:Merchant ships of the United Kingdom Category:Cargo liners Category:Ships built in Aberdeen Category:1989 ships Category:Mine warfare vessels of the Royal Navy Category:Ships built by Hall, Russell & Company ","title":"RMS St Helena (1989)"},{"id":"3784759","text":"George Albert Hormel (December 4, 1860 ‚Äì June 5, 1946) was an American entrepreneur, he was the founder of Hormel Foods Corporation (then known as George A.

He founded Dialogue House in New York City to help promote this method. Progoff began exploring psychological methods for creativity and spiritual experience in their social applications in the early 1950s. His doctoral dissertation in the field of the social history of ideas at the New School was on the work of C.G. Jung. In 1953, the dissertation was published in hardcover by the Julian Press as Jung's Psychology and its Social Meaning. Later editions were published by the Grove Press, Anchor/Doubleday, and Dialogue House. After receiving his doctorate, Progoff was awarded a Bollingen fellowship, and studied privately with Jung in Switzerland. This work led to a reconstruction of depth psychology in terms of the later work of Freud, Adler, Jung, and Rank in The Death and Rebirth of Psychology and a first statement of Holistic Depth Psychology in Depth Psychology and Modern Man. In 1963, Progoff put forward the method of Psyche-Evoking in The Symbolic and the Real. In 1966, Progoff drew from the principles described in these books to introduce the Intensive Journal method of personal development, the innovation for which he is most remembered. This is a nonanalytic, integrative system for evoking and interrelating the contents of an individual life. Progoff wrote two books describing the method: At a Journal Workshop and The Practice of Process Meditation. The system's popularity spread rapidly. As the public use of the method increased, the National Intensive Journal Program was formed in 1977. It supplied materials and leaders for the conduct of Intensive Journal workshops in the United States and other countries in cooperation with local sponsoring organizations. The Intensive Journal education program was expanded upon in 1983 with the publication of Life-Study, which described the application of the Intensive Journal process in experiencing the lives of significant persons from past generations.Jung's Psychology and its Social Meaning (Third Edition): About the Author.

It is based on the DC Comics character of the same name. It is a traditional single-player side- scrolling arcade game where the player controls Superman through various levels in an effort to defeat the evil supervillain named Brainiac. Other super villains, as bosses, include The Prankster, Metallo and Mister Mxyzptlk. This game was planned to be released on the SNES, but was cancelled sometime before it was completed. Versions of the game for the Sega Master System and Sega Game Gear were developed by Craftgold and published by Virgin Interactive in Europe as Superman: The Man of Steel, which was also the title received by the European Mega Drive version published by Virgin.  Gameplay and plot  Superman must confront some generic bad guys before being able to confront the end-level boss. Each level of the game begins with a front page of the Daily Planet announcing that some supervillain is wreaking havok on the city, and with Clark Kent a.k.a. Superman leaping into a phonebooth in order to start the level. The game limited the powers of Superman to jumping, punching and kicking (he could not fly except in cutscenes). He could only use his famous superpowers by collecting certain icons scattered throughout the level that were required to accomplish a certain task, i.e. a superpunch icon to break down a wall in order to further advance in the level. At the end of each level, Superman battled one of the a super villain from the comics and the intermission between each level was a congratulatory message from the Daily Planet newspaper. The final level involved Superman flying up into Brainiac's space station for a repeat battle with the previous super villain bosses and then a final battle with Brainiac.  Development and release  Reception  The game received from generally mixed to negative. While the game was noted for its decent 16-bit graphics and sound, critics panned the game for its limited usage of Superman's powers and for having a limited storyline. As the player could only have one super power icon at a time, a glitch in the pre-production editions of the game (fixed before its release but still a problem in the edition that was reviewed by many video game critics) forced the player to reset the game if they collected the wrong icon.

In 1971, he moved from Sweden to Germany, and in 1977, he established EF's head office in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he now lives. He served as the company's CEO until 2002 and as chairman until 2008. Today, he is semi- retired. Two of his four sons serve in the company; his oldest son, Philip Hult, as company chairman and his third son, Edward Hult, as CEO of North America. Under Bertil Hult's supervision, EF grew to a multi-billion dollar corporation with more than 40,000 employees in 53 countries. Early life and education Bertil Hult was born in Stockholm. He has spoken frequently about his struggles with dyslexia as a child. He dropped out of school after junior high and worked making coffee and running errands for a ship broker in London. He learned to speak English during this time and became convinced that immersion is the best way to learn a language. After returning to Sweden and taking up his studies again, he entered Lund University, then dropped out after one year. Career Hult founded EF Education First at the age of 23 in the basement of his university dormitory in Lund, Sweden. He started EF as a language study and travel abroad organization, initially for Swedish high school students going to England to learn English. His childhood struggles with dyslexia convinced him that cultural immersion was a superior way to study a language. He served as the company's CEO until 2002, as its chairman until 2008, and then semi-retired. Under Hult's supervision, EF grew to become a multi-billion dollar corporation with more than 40,000 employees across 500 schools and educational programs in 53 different countries. EF continues to open language schools around the world, grow its online language school (EF Englishtown), place au pairs with American families, coordinate life-changing student travel, and international exchange experiences. EF is affiliated with a business school, Hult International Business School, formerly the Arthur D. Little School of Management, which is named after Bertil Hult. EF Education First is wholly owned by Hult and his family. Forbes estimated Bertil's net worth to be US$5 billion as of March 2015.

His films include La hora de los hornos (The Hour of the Furnaces) (1968), Tangos: el exilio de Gardel (1985), Sur (1988), El viaje (1992), La nube (1998) and Memoria del saqueo (2004), among many others. He was National Senator representing the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires for six years. Solanas studied theatre, music and law. In 1962, he directed his first short feature Seguir andando and in 1968 he covertly produced and directed his first long feature film La Hora de los Hornos, a documentary on neo-colonialism and violence in Latin America. The film won several international awards and was screened around the world. Solanas has won the Grand Jury Prize and the Critics Award at the Venice Film Festival and the Prix de la mise en sc√®ne at the Cannes Film Festival. In 1999 he was the President of the Jury at the 21st Moscow International Film Festival. He was awarded a special Honorary Golden Bear at the 2004 Berlin Film Festival. He collaborated with tango composer and musician √Åstor Piazzolla on the soundtracks for various movies. Context Solanas was at the forefront of the Grupo Cine Liberaci√≥n that shook Argentine cinema in the 1970s, developing its social conscience and political voice. He was active in the campaign to support Per√≥n. Threatened by right-wing forces in the 1970s, one of his actors was assassinated and he himself was almost kidnapped. Together with Octavio Getino, Solanas wrote the manifesto \\"Toward a Third Cinema\\". The idea of a political Third Cinema, opposed to Hollywood cinema and European auteur cinema, inspired film makers in many so-called developing countries. Solanas went into exile in Paris in 1976, only returning to Argentina with the arrival of democracy in 1983. Solanas accepting a Silver Mayahuel award at the Guadalajara Film Festival, 2008. Political work He continued to make political films and was an outspoken critic of Carlos Menem, the Argentine President. Three days after such a public criticism, on 21 May 1991, Solanas was shot six times in his legs. Despite dealing with the attack and disability, Solanas became even more involved in politics and stood to be a Senator for Buenos Aires, receiving 7% of the vote in 1992. A year later he was elected a National Deputy for the Frente Grande list, although he left the party after a year. Solanas continues to write and direct, including the 2005 film La Dignidad de los Nadies and the recently 2008 film La √∫ltima estaci√≥n. His son, Juan Solanas, is also a noted film director. In October 2007, Solanas was a presidential candidate in the 2007 Argentine general election for the Authentic Socialist Party. He became the 5th most voted candidate, with 1.58% of the vote. In 2009, Solanas was elected as National Deputy for the city of Buenos Aires on the June 28th parliamentary elections, as his party Proyecto Sur became the 2nd force on the city by collecting 24.2% of the votes.

His musical development in the early years was with his brother Aston \\"Family Man\\" Barrett as a member of Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry's \\"house band\\" The Upsetters. The brothers joined Bob Marley and The Wailers around 1970. He co wrote the well known Bob Marley song \\"War\\" and with his brother Aston co-wrote \\"Talkin' Blues\\". Carlton Barrett is featured on all the albums recorded by the Wailers. Barrett popularised the one drop rhythm, a percussive drumming style created by Winston Grennan. With Carly's beats and his brother Aston's bass, the Wailer rhythm section planted the seeds of today's international reggae. Barrett was murdered outside his home in Jamaica on 17 April 1987. Biography \\"Carly Barrett\\", as he liked to be called, was born in Jamaica in 1950, the son of Wilfred and Violet Barrett. As a teenager he built his first set of drums out of some empty paint tins, and had initially been influenced by Lloyd Knibb, the great drummer from the Skatalites. He and his brother Aston were raised in Kingston and absorbed the emerging ska sound. Working as a welder he first tried building a guitar and playing. He realised guitar wasn't his thing and picked up the drums. In the late 1960s Carlton started playing sessions with his brother Aston, the pair calling themselves the Soul Mates or the Rhythm Force, before settling on The Hippy Boys, a line-up that featured Max Romeo on vocals. Leroy Brown, Delano Stewart, Glen Adams and Alva Lewis also played in the band's fluctuating line- up. The Hippy Boys became one of Kingston's busiest session bands; fittingly their first recording was \\"Watch This Sound\\", backing the late Slim Smith. They also released a couple of albums for Lloyd Charmers, Reggae with the Hippy Boys and Reggae Is Tight. As well as playing on many sessions for Bunny Lee and Sonia Pottinger, the Barrett brothers also played on two 1969 UK chart hits, \\"Liquidator\\" for Harry J, and \\"Return of Django\\" for Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry, with whom they had now taken root. For Perry, they took the name The Upsetters, and knocked out a long run of instrumentals, including \\"Clint Eastwood\\", \\"Cold Sweat\\", \\"Night Doctor\\", and \\"Live Injection\\". It was while with Perry that the Barrett brothers first teamed up with The Wailers, then a vocal trio consisting of Bob, Peter and Bunny. After recording many now classic numbers, Carly and Aston decided to team up with The Wailers on a permanent basis. The Barrett brothers recorded several singles with the Wailers in 1969-70: \\"My Cup\\", \\"Duppy Conqueror\\", \\"Soul Rebel\\", and \\"Small Axe\\". Most of these songs appeared on two Perry-produced Wailers albums: Soul Rebels and Soul Revolution, and formed the early foundation of the one drop sound. Though original Wailers Peter Tosh and Bunny Livingston left the group in 1973, Carlton and Aston remained with Bob Marley and went on to record Natty Dread in 1974. Carlton has songwriting credits for two of Natty Dread's songs: \\"Talkin' Blues\\" and \\"Them Belly Full\\". Carlton remained with the Wailers in the studio and on tour until Bob Marley's death in 1981. His signature style can be heard on every recording the Wailers produced since 1969, with the exception of the 1970 \\"Soul Shakedown Party\\" sessions produced by Leslie Kong. On 17 April 1987, just as Carlton arrived at his Kingston home and walked across his yard, a gunman stepped up behind him and shot him twice in the head. He was dead on arrival at a Kingston hospital at age 36. Shortly after his murder, Carlton's wife, Albertine, her lover, a taxi driver named Glenroy Carter, and another man, Junior Neil, were arrested and charged with his killing. Albertine and Carter escaped the murder charge, and were instead convicted and sentenced to 7 years for conspiracy. After just one year in prison, they were released in December 1992 on a legal technicality. Equipment Throughout his tenure with the Wailers and other projects, Carlton used a standard five-piece drum set consisting of a bass drum, two tom-toms (mounted on the bass drum), a floor tom-tom, and a snare drum. Each tom-tom had only one drumhead, which gave the drums a dry sound that was ideal for the close-miked environment of the recording studio. However, it was Carlton's snare drum which was perhaps the biggest part of his signature sound. For much of the Wailer's early career, Carlton, like the othe band members were often relying on either studio supplied or rented gear, so the kits he played on varied though he came to favor Ludwig drums, and his snare was the popular Supraphonic model, which is made of \\"ludalloy\\", an aluminium alloy. The metal construction of the drum, in combination with the extremely high head tension that Carlton preferred, produced a loud, cutting \\"crack\\" sound that was a very prominent element of the Wailers' recordings. Carlton almost always left the snare wires of the drum disengaged, making the drum sound very similar to a timbale. Later in the late '70s Barrett was also known to use Yamaha drums when they began to be the favored brand circulating amongst many musicians. It is unknown exactly what make and model of cymbals were used on Carlton's drum set, although it is very likely that they were made by the Avedis Zildjian Company in the United States and imported into Jamaica; certainly in many of the later photos and videos of the band the Zildjian logo was noticeably present on his cymbals. Carlton used only a pair of hi-hat cymbals usually 14\\" in size, (relatively light in weight, thought to perhaps be Zildjian's new beat models which were there most popular type), at times with a cloth placed between the two cymbals. He also usually used at least two crash cymbals (most likely of medium weight), sometimes more, that were any combination of 14\\", 16\\", 17\\" and 18\\" sizes. However, due to the nature of Carlton's style, in which the snare drum, bass drum, and hi-hat cymbals were the primary timekeeping instruments, he did not use a ride cymbal though some photos do show him with smaller, splash-type effect cymbals. He also used a cowbell for live performances, evident in Bob Marley & The Wailers album Live!.

It was founded as Francis Latour & Co in the late 18th century, then became Arbuthnot De Monte & Co. It failed spectacularly on 22 October 1906. In the last quarter of 1906, Madras (now Chennai) was hit by the worst financial crisis the city was ever to suffer. Of the three best-known British commercial names in 19th century Madras, one crashed; a second had to be resurrected by a distress sale; and the third was bailed out by a benevolent benefactor. The agency house to close shop, Arbuthnot's, was considered the soundest of the three. Parry's (now EID Parry), may have been the earliest of them and Binny and Co.'s founders may have had the oldest associations with Madras, but it was Arbuthnot & Co., established in 1810, that was the city's strongest commercial organization in the 19th Century. When it fell, thousands lost their savings and the good name of British stability was severely rocked. Arbuthnot & Co had two partners at the time of its failure, namely Sir George Gough Arbuthnot and J.M. Young, a salaried partner who seems to have had no voice in the running of the firm. The firm entered into an arrangement with Patrick Macfadyen who operated P Macfadyen & Co which was effectively Arbuthnot's London branch. Macfadyen engaged in speculation, in the process losing huge amounts of the firm's money. Prior to its collapse, Arbuthnots employed between 11,000 and 12,000 people, had 7,000 creditors, and ¬£1,000,000 in liabilities. It was ascertained that the liabilities of Macfadyen's were ¬£400,000 and there were 1,000 creditors. It was agreed by the English trustee in bankruptcy and the official assignee in Madras that the assets of the two insolvent firms were to be treated as one and the same business, all creditors were to be entitled to share rateably in the pooled assets. Macfadyen committed suicide by throwing himself under a train in 1906, and both firms had to close their doors. Both Macfadyen and Arbuthnot were consistently over-optimistic concerning their speculations. Arbuthnot was tried for the fraudulent activities the collapse revealed, and received a sentence of \\"18 months rigorous imprisonment\\". A key figure in case was the Madras lawyer, V. Krishnaswamy Iyer, who went on to organize a group of Chettiars that founded Indian Bank in 1907.

Arkansas was launched almost a year later on 10 November 1900, sponsored by Mary L. Macon; but not commissioned for another two years, on 28 October 1902, with Commander Charles E. Vreeland in command. This last class of monitors had been designed and built because of public demand for coastal defense before the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. By the time they were built and commissioned their purpose had passed. They didn't fit into the Navy's new purpose and so they bounced around from different assignments to another.

Giacomo Quarenghi (; ; 20 or 21 September 1744) was the foremost and most prolific practitioner of neoclassical architecture in Imperial Russia, particularly in Saint Petersburg. He brought into vogue an original monumental style, of Palladian inspiration, which was a reference for many architects who worked in Russia. He has been described as \\"the last of the great architects of Italy\\".Christopher Marsden. Palmyra of the North. Faber and Faber Limited, 1942. 2nd edition. Page 10.  Career in Italy  Born in Rota d'Imagna near Bergamo to an Italian noble family, Quarenghi was destined by his parents for a career in law or the church but initially was allowed to study painting in the Bergamo studio of G. Reggi, himself a student of Tiepolo. Young Quarenghi was well educated and widely read. Traveling through Italy he visited Vicenza, Verona, Mantua and Venice, the places where he made the longest stays. He made drawings of the Greek temples at Paestum (Loukomski 1928) and finally arrived in Rome in 1763, at a moment when Neoclassicism was being developed in advanced artistic circles. He studied painting with Anton Raphael Mengs, then with Stefano Pozzi, later moving to study architecture (1767‚Äì69) with a traditionalist Late Baroque architect Paolo Posi. Then he came upon a copy of Andrea Palladio's Quattro Libri d'archittetura. \\"You could never believe,\\" he wrote to his friend and long-term correspondent Marchesi, \\"the impression that this book made. Then it struck me that I had every reason to consider myself badly guided\\" before that point (Loukomsky 1928). He turned for new, Neoclassical instruction to Antoine Decrezet, a friend of Winckelmann, and the former's pupil Niccola Giansimoni, measuring and drawing the antiquities of Rome. In Venice (1771‚Äì1772), where he was studying the works of Palladio, Quarenghi came into contact with a British lord passing through there on the Grand Tour. It was through him that the architect secured a few minor English commissions, such as garden pavilions, chimney-pieces (Loukomsky 1928), and an altar for the private Roman Catholic chapel of Henry Arundell at New Wardour Castle. Designs for a country house for Lord Whitworth were exhibited at Venice 1967. His first major commission (1771‚Äì7) was the internal reconstruction of the monastery of Santa Scholastica at Subiaco. For the Venetian cardinal Rezzonico, the nephew of Pope Clement XIII, he designed a decor for a Music Room in the Campidoglio, and designs for Clement's tomb (later executed by Antonio Canova). His work in Italy and for English clients formed enough of a reputation that in 1779 he was selected by the Prussian- born count Rieffenstein, who had been commissioned by Catherine II of Russia to send her two Italian architects to replace her French ones (Loukomsky 1928). Despite having just designed a manege in Monaco and a dining hall for the Archduchess of Modena, 35-year-old Quarenghi seems to have felt himself underemployed, given the number of architects then working in Italy and the dearth of commissions from the church and nobility. He accepted Rieffenstein's offer without hesitation and left with his pregnant wife for St Petersburg.  Career under Catherine II  Quarenghi's Hermitage Theatre in St Petersburg, original drawing in the National Museum in Warsaw. Quarenghi's first important commission in Russia was the English Palace in Peterhof, a magnificent rectangular edifice with a Corinthian portico. The structure, which pleased the Empress immensely, was blown up by the Germans during World War II and was later demolished by the Soviet government. In 1783 Quarenghi settled with his family in Tsarskoe Selo, where he would supervise the construction of the Alexander Palace, the most ambitious of his undertakings to date. Appointed to the post of Catherine II's court architect, Quarenghi went on to produce a prodigious number of designs for the Empress, her successors and members of her court: houses, summerhouses, bridges, theatres, hospices, a market, a bank building, interior decorations and garden designs. His projects were put into execution as far away from the capital as Novhorod-Siverskyi, Ukraine where a cathedral was constructed to his designs. In Moscow, he was responsible for the reconstruction of medieval Red Square in a fashionable neo-Palladian mode. Count Nicholas Sheremetev engaged him to devise a theatre hall in the Ostankino Palace and a semicircular colonnade for the Sheremetev Hospital. Most of Quarenghi's designs intended for Moscow were subsequently realized with significant modifications by other architects, as was the case with Gostiny Dvor (1789‚Äì1805), Catherine Palace (1782‚Äì87), and Sloboda Palace (1790‚Äì94).  Career under Paul and Alexander I  Caricature of Giacomo Quarenghi wearing the Order of the Knights of Malta, by his friend Aleksander Or≈Çowski. vedute meticulously represent mediaeval monuments of Moscow and its environs. Emperor Paul disliked everything that was dear to his mother and Quarenghi's architecture obviously fell into this category. After the emperor took the Maltese knights under his protection, Quarenghi also joined the Order and served as its official architect until 1800. His commissions became less frequent, as the monotonous rhythm of solemn colonnades and the laconic clarity of symmetrical compositions appeared boring to those courtiers who had found Quarenghi's designs so delightful a decade earlier. Under such circumstances, he visited Italy in 1801 and was given a triumphant welcome. He turned his attention to watercolours, enlivening conventional architectural vistas with genre scenes from everyday city life. He also published several albums of neo-Palladian designs (1787, 1791, 1810) and provided elaborate designs for decorative vases, capitals for columns and metalwork executed for imperial residences, particularly the Winter Palace. With the enthronement of Alexander I of Russia, Quarenghi was again at the height of his individuality and fashion. In 1805 the architect became a corresponding member of the Imperial Academy of Arts. His design for the Anichkov Palace Colonnade, however, incurred severe criticism from the academic establishment for the perceived erratic use of classical orders. Quarenghi defended himself in a letter to Canova proclaiming that \\"good sense and judgment shouldn't be enslaved by commonly accepted rules and models\\". Giacomo Quarenghi was granted Russian nobility and the Order of St. Vladimir of the First Degree in 1814. After 1808 he lived largely in retirement as a celebrity. Of his thirteen children by two wives, a few chose to remain in Russia, while others returned to Italy. He died at age 72 in Saint Petersburg. When the 150th anniversary of his death was being marked in 1967, the remains of Quarenghi were moved from the Volkov Cemetery to the Lazarevskoe Cemetery at the Alexander Nevsky Monastery, and a bust of the architect was erected between the Assignation Bank and Bank Bridge in Saint Petersburg.  Works in St Petersburg  Quarenghi regarded the Smolny Institute for Noble Maidens as the most accomplished project of his declining years.

At , it is the second highest peak in the Clear Lake Volcanic Field, which consists of numerous volcanic domes and cones ranging from 10,000 to 2.1 million years old. Although it is often described as extinct, it is actually classified as High Threat Potential.http://geology.about.com/library/bl/peaks/blkonocti.htm Mount Konocti, California, USA‚ÄîGeology‚ÄîAbout.com Clear Lake Volcanic Field's alert level is currently classified as Normal.  Geography  The volcano is the most visible landmark in Lake County other than the lake. The mountain is located between the towns of Lakeport and Clearlake. It lies directly south of Soda Bay and Riviera Heights and east of Kelseyville. Konocti Harbor and Soda Bay sit at the base of the mountain. From the summit of Mount Konocti, the taller peaks and ridges around Snow Mountain can be seen to the northeast. Mount Konocti has five distinctive peaks: Wright Peak (), Howard Peak (), South Peak (), Buckingham Peak () and Clark Peak (). Wright Peak, Howard Peak, and South Peak make up the main part of the mountain, while Buckingham Peak and Clark Peak are located off to the side. Konocti Road runs about west from the Taylor Planetarium & Observatory in the town of Kelseyville, snaking between Howard and South Peaks and ending at the mountain's summit, Wright Peak. Benson Ridge lies to the south of Clark Peak and west of South Peak. Buckingham Peak lies north of Howard and Wright Peaks and northeast of Clark Peak. South Peak is directly south of Howard Peak and southwest of Wright Peak. Wright Peak lies east and a little north of Howard Peak.  History  Mount Konocti probably first erupted some 350,000 years ago and last erupted 11,000 years ago. Mount Konocti has an explosive, eruptive history with devastating lava flows ending about 13,000 years ago that formed the mountains from Clearlake Oaks to Ukiah, all of which now are covered by trees making the ancient flows hard to find. Clear Lake is much older and is possibly the oldest securely dated lake in North America. Core samples taken by U.S. Geological Survey geologists in 1973 and 1980 have been dated to 480,000 years. Archaeologists have found evidence that native people, principally Pomo people and Wappo, have inhabited the area around Konocti for as much as 11,000 years. The name \\"Konocti\\" is derived from the Pomo \\"kno\\", mountain, and \\"htai\\", woman. The mountain is covered with heavy concentrations of chaparral similar to the European maquis shrubland. Oak, Pacific madrone, manzanita, western white pine and other plant species of the California coastal mountains dominate the area. On the northeast slope of Mount Konocti is a steep, heavily forested area known locally as the \\"Black Forest\\", because it never gets direct sunshine. The Black Forest contains heavy stands of Douglas fir. Local people have long known that Konocti is riddled with natural caves. Although most of the natural caves collapsed or were filled in for safety in the early 20th century, persistent local belief holds that Konocti's central magma chamber is a vast, empty vertical cavern, partly filled with Clear Lake water and connecting with the lake via an underground seep. This cavern might be the largest on Earth, though its existence is difficult to prove due to the unstable and eroding structure of the volcano's cone. Heavy vegetation also conceals cave entrances. No accurate map or survey of the caves has been created due to the heavy underbrush and unstable hillsides. The majority of Konocti is owned by private parties, who have discouraged exploration and study of the mountain in recent years. The County of Lake recently purchased 1,520 acres on top of the mountain. As a result, Mt. Konocti County Park opened to the public on September 24, 2011.http://www.lakecounty.com/AboutLC/Explore/Konocti.htm Retrieved October 29, 2011. Pomo legend has it that around the year 1818, after a long drought, the level of Clear Lake dropped so low that a previously unknown cave on the eastern flank of Konocti was exposed. A group of Pomo men entered the cave, and discovered a vast underground lake, containing \\"blind fish\\". Repeated attempts by divers to locate this cave have been unsuccessful. Note : this article does not give a specific date, and describes the legend as \\"Their oral history allegedly describes a severe drought during which the lake water fell dramatically\\" Although the peak of Konocti was owned privately for a long time, it was acquired by Lake County in 2009. It is now called the Mount Konocti County Park, and is open to the public.http://www.konoctitrails.com/trails-information/mt-konocti-regional- park Mount Konocti County Park  Geological status  The U.S. Geological Survey classifies the Clear Lake Volcanic Field, of which Mount Konocti is the most prominent volcano, as High Threat Potential.

The name is derived from the opinion that this is the area in which a batsman struggles most to determine whether to play forward or back, or to leave the delivery. If a batsman leaves the ball, there is a chance the ball will turn inward and either bowl him or hit him with an increased chance of leg before wicket. If a batsman plays the ball, there is a chance the ball will go to the outside instead, leading to an outside edge that can be caught by the slip fielders or wicketkeeper. The first recorded use of the phrase is often, perhaps wrongly, credited to former Yorkshire and England batsman, now commentator, Geoffrey Boycott whilst commentating on England's 1990 tour of the West Indies. There are other earlier claims to coinage, however, including a televised interview with Merv Hughes who says Allan Border instructed him to bowl in the \\"corridor of uncertainty\\" at one point in the 1988-1989 West Indies tour of Australia. Among the references found online, one that predates Boycott's claim by several months is an article from the Age on 11 July 1989 where Martin Blake attributed it to Terry Alderman. It says that Alderman \\"rarely strayed from the \\"corridor of uncertainty\\" that he coined himself several years ago\\" The phrase has also been used in other sports commentary. In football it is commonly used to describe a cross or pass which is delivered into the area in front of the goalkeeper and behind the last line of defence. The \\"uncertainty\\" in this case comes from the decision which both the last defender and the goalkeeper must make: whether to defend the ball, or leave it to the other player. \\"Corridor of uncertainty\\" is also the name, or part of the name, of several online cricket forums and at least two fanzine-type cricket publications.

Written in 1893 with the title Marta Ajala, it was originally published in episodes in the Roman newspaper La Tribuna from June 29 to August 16, 1901, with the definitive title L'Esclusa. It was finally republished in single volume in 1908 in Milan by the Fratelli Treves. In this edition, a letter dedicated to Luigi Capuana was also published in which the author expressed his concerns that the \\"humoristic foundation\\" of the novel might have escaped those who had read the newspaper version. He also points out that \\"every will is excluded, even though the characters are left with the full illusion that they are acting voluntarily.\\" He added that \\"nature, without any apparent order, bristling with contradictions is often extremely remote from the work of art...\\" which almost always arbitrarily harmonizes and rationalizes reality. These were striking assertions which seemed decidedly remote from the realism that actually dominates the novel. But this would be his one of his final experiments with narrative realism (at least in the novel form) and, in it, he succeeds in demonstrating the genre's obvious limitations and insufficiency. Plot The story itself is set in a small village in Sicily. The protagonist Marta Ajala feels \\"excluded\\" from the society in which she lives because of having catastrophically lost the position and status that she had been assigned in the order of things: the position of a submissive and bored housewife who never quite felt at ease in her role, but who had achieved respect in society because of it. It is a role which she does not regret losing, but whose sudden and violent loss has thrown her into a dramatic situation: she has been kicked out of her home by her husband who caught her by surprise in the act of reading a letter from someone who has been courting her but whose advances she has always rejected. The precipitous decision of the husband overwhelmed with rage; the attitude of Marta's father who, even while knowing that his daughter is innocent, totally supports her husband's decision out of a misbegotten sense of masculine spiritual solidarity and ends up dying of shame; the submissive suffering of the mother and sister, constantly ready, in order to conform to traditional convictions, to counsel her surrender and obedience; the choral malevolence of the villagers, taking advantage of a religious procession that is passing by under their windows to publicly jeer and shout names at her, are the elements of a minutely described painting, in the manner of realism, which illustrate the closed mentality of the village. But Marta's reaction is only partly similar to that of the typical characters of the naturalistic novel. She reveals a much more complex psychology which begins with a petit bourgeoisie self-satisfaction for the letters of Gregorio Alvignani and gradually develops into an obstinate struggle against all of society for a moral and economic revenge which she will finally end up obtaining, but joylessly. The cruel game of chance prevails over the objectivity of the narrative, according to an unexpected logic, expressed in a series of coincidences which betray their own hidden meaning. The father dies at the same time that Marta's baby, which she had been carrying in her womb with so much repulsion, is born, as if to signify a repudiation and detachment from the past. Meanwhile, in the streets of the village, the people are celebrating the victory of Alvignani in the elections, a premonitory sign of Marta's eventual redemption and revenge. The singularity of circumstances bursts wide open in the final scene: Marta's husband, after kicking her out of her home, making her suffer, and compromising the birth of his own son, now takes her back when she has actually become guilty of the sin of which she was falsely accused and is carrying her lover's baby in her womb. In giving herself to Alvignani, who helped her in dealing with the injustices of the scholastic authorities, she seems to adapt herself to the role of his lover which has been imposed on her by society. But her state of mind is never one of passive surrender, even if her restless struggle against circumstances dominated by an unfathomable force will turn out to be in vain. In the end what defeats her is not the society by which she is rehabilitated, but life itself which brings with it a suffering which no success can cancel. It is significant, in fact, that the author uses the word l'esclusa precisely at the opening of the second part of the novel, where, in an atmosphere redolent of spring, Marta seems to be on the verge of resurrection. Her tenacious struggle against everyone and against resignation has allowed her to obtain the much- desired teaching position that has permitted her to rescue her mother and sister from extreme poverty. But the happiness of these two women, of which she is secretly proud, is what forces her to recognize her own spiritual isolation and her inability to reinsert herself into society. \\"She alone was the excluded one, she alone would never again find her place.\\" Works about Pirandello as novelist * M.

Plot summary The story starts with a brief description of Mr. Holohan, who works for an Irish cultural society and has been arranging a series of concerts. Holohan‚Äôs bad leg is a prominent feature. We are then introduced to Mrs. Kearney, who was very accomplished at a young age but found that the young men of her class were intimidated by her, which prompted her to marry the working class Mr. Kearney ‚Äúout of spite.‚Äù Her daughter Kathleen goes to good schools and learns to play the piano. Mrs. Kearney decides to use the Irish Revival as a means of improving the family‚Äôs social position. She is successful enough that Kathleen gets the attention of Holohan, who hires the girl as an accompanist at four vocal concerts put on by his society. Holohan and Mrs. Kearney collaborate well on the planning of the performances. The first concert is sparsely attended. The second one has more patrons, but Mrs. Kearney is bothered by the behaviour of the audience and the casual attitude of the society‚Äôs secretary, Mr. Fitzpatrick. The third concert is cancelled. Mrs. Kearney is concerned that her daughter will not be paid the full contracted price but is unable to get a straight answer on the matter from Holohan or Fitzpatrick. She brings her husband to the final concert, anticipating a confrontation. On the night of the concert, Mrs. Kearney is unable to get a proper answer on her request for full payment and insists her daughter will not play until paid. The dispute holds up the beginning of the performance until Fitzpatrick pays Mrs. Kearney half the agreed amount, promising the rest at the interval. Although the first half of the concert is successful, the description of the performers, either too immature or past their prime, is not flattering. At the interval, Mrs. Kearney is told the rest of the money will be paid in three days. An indignant Mrs. Kearney refuses to let her daughter play. Another accompanist is found, and Mrs. Kearney and her family, roundly condemned by all at this point, leave. The story presents both the mother‚Äôs greed and choler and the inexperience and condescension of the society‚Äôs members in a bad light. References *Joyce, James.

Plant Close-ups of Salicaceae flowers, It is a deciduous shrub or small tree growing to 4-15 metres (13-50 ft) tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, 2-9 cm (1-3¬Ω in) long and 1‚Äì3 cm (¬Ω-1¬Ω in) broad (exceptionally up to 16 cm long and 5 cm broad), green above, hairy below, with a crenate margin. The flowers are produced in early spring in catkins 2‚Äì5 cm long; it is dioecious with male and female catkins on separate plants. The male catkins are silvery at first, turning yellow when the pollen is released; the female catkins are greenish-grey, maturing in early summer to release the numerous tiny seeds embedded in white cottony down which assists wind dispersal. The two subspecies are: *S. c. cinerea - central and eastern Europe, western Asia, shrub to 4‚Äì6 m (rarely 10 m) tall, with smooth bark, leaves densely hairy below with pale yellow-grey hairs, stipules large, persistent until autumn *S. c. oleifolia (Sm.)

For three generations it served not only as a public pier in day-to-day use but also as a major ceremonial arrival and departure point. The pier witnessed the official arrival in Hong Kong of all of Hong Kong's governors since 1925; Elizabeth II landed there in 1975, as did the Prince and Princess of Wales in 1989. The second and final pier structure, built along the newly reclaimed waterfront, was designed in a modern utilitarian style and was opened by Maurine Grantham, wife of Governor Alexander Grantham, in June 1954. On 26 April 2007, the pier was closed by the Government to enable land reclamation, soon after the adjacent Star Ferry pier was closed. There was fierce opposition by conservationists, who carried over their campaign to preserve the landmark. Police officers evicted some 30 protesters from the site on 1 August 2007; activists filed for a judicial review, and the High Court hearing began on 7 August. On 10 August, the court dismissed the request. Finally, the Queen's Pier was completely demolished in February 2008. Its base piles were also removed in March 2008. In 2008, the government's attempts, post dismantling, to create the appearance of public support for reassembling the pier at the new waterfront were criticised by conservationists.

The new piers (background left) now in full operation. A former wooden pier at the site known as \\"Queen's Statue Wharf\\" was replaced in 1925. It was a ceremonial landing area for the British Royal Family visiting Hong Kong, and for successive governors to assert their authority on arrival. The first governor to land there was Cecil Clementi, in November 1925. The preceding governor, Reginald Stubbs, boarded the Victoria from the pier at the end of his term on 31 October 1925. 1925 pier The 1925 pier was originally named \\"Statue Pier\\", but was renamed \\"Queen's Pier\\" in honour of Queen Victoria on 31 July 1924.\\"A Historical and Architectural Appraisal of Queen‚Äôs Pier, Central (Annexe B3) , Antiquities and Monuments Office, Government of Hong Kong SAR.

It was demolished in January 1955. 1954 pier As part of post-war reclamation, the old pier was demolished. Work commenced in February 1954 on a new pier on the new waterfront designed in a modern utilitarian style. The structure was described as a U-shaped plan, with an open-sided superstructure. It consisted of tiled reinforced concrete base and pillars, and was modelled after previous piers in the area. Its flat roof was also made of concrete, topped with bitumen waterproofing. Five sets of stairs allowed boat passengers to board and disembark, three located on the north side, one on the east and one on the west. The pier was considered \\"an integral part\\" of the ceremonial cluster including City Hall and Edinburgh Place which was being formed at the time, and the entrance to the City Hall formed an axis with the Pier to lend a sense of occasion to visiting dignitaries. The secondary design goal was to maximise public access to the very limited open space in Central in contrast with the city bustle.Liz Heron, \\"Save Queen's Pier, says architect of City Hall complex\\", South China Morning Post, 13 May 2007, page 4 The pier was opened by Lady Maurine Grantham, wife of Governor Sir Alexander Grantham, on 28 June 1954.Sara Z Al-Sudairy, Royal landing site valued by public , The Standard, 2 August 2007.

It was the traditional landing place of successive governors, who would arrive at Central on board the official Governor's Yacht which would dock at Queen's Pier. From the 1960s, governors would inspect a guard of honour at Edinburgh Place, followed by the swearing-in at City Hall.

Tour boats offering a view of the Kowloon side of the harbour used the pier for passenger boarding. Up to 1978, it was the finishing line for the annual cross-harbour swimming race. As the ceremonies declined, the pier's secondary purpose became the main one: people met and strolled in the area, and others fished. On 26 April 2007, the pier was closed in order to facilitate land reclamation in Central.\\"In Hong Kong, no looking back at Britain\\", International Herald Tribune, 26 April 2007.

However, the scale of reclamations has only been slightly cut back following significant legal battles. Government's position Following the controversy and the demolition of the Star Ferry Pier in Edinburgh Place in early 2007, activists declared Queen's Pier the next battle-ground against the conservation policy of the Government of Hong Kong. The criticism received over its handling of the Star Ferry Pier caused Michael Suen, the Secretary for Housing, Planning and Lands, to propose a piece-by-piece relocation of the pier to a new location on the reclaimed waterfront during a Legco session on 21 March 2007.Winnie Chong, \\"New spot for pier at old location\\" , The Standard, 22 March 2007.

Retrieved 7 August 2007 The intended closure of the pier was 26 April 2007. At the end of January 2007, the government declared it would postpone the demolition of Queen's Pier until a consensus could be reached on the course of action; consultations with the Hong Kong Institute of Architects, the Hong Kong Institute of Engineers, and the Conservancy Association were held. The Institute of Architects, whose members opposed dismantling the pier, originally maintained the pier should remain untouched. However, it was reported that after meeting the government, the Institute and the Conservancy Association were persuaded by the government that the pier could first be dismantled, and then reassembled at another location after completion of the reclamation. This change of heart was heavily criticised by Winston Chu, founder of the Society for Protection of the Harbour. The HKIA clarified that their opposition had not in fact changed.Press Statement: Approval of Funding for Dismantling and Reassembling Queen's Pier by LegCo Public Works Subcommittee at its Meeting held on 23 May 2007 , Hong Kong Institute of Architects, 7 June 2007. Retrieved 7 August 2007 Chief Executive Donald Tsang said that being overzealous in saving the past may hurt Hong Kong's competitiveness, and called on activists to take a more balanced view toward economic growth and conservation. Soon after Tsang's re-election as Chief Executive, on 26 March, the Government pressed ahead with plans to dismantle and move the entire pier, piece by piece, enabling the reclamation to go ahead.Pier preservation plan proposed , HK Government, 26 March 2007 The government said that the in-situ preservation, though apparently viable on paper, would risk irreversible damage to the pier. Furthermore, it argued that important underground facilities such as the Airport Railway Extended Overrun Tunnel would be affected, saying a natural curvature of the track was required. \\"Setting aside the technical difficulties and the huge risk involved in the works, underpinning for the construction of the extended overrun tunnel would cost about HK$500 million and take more than two years to complete\\". Appearing before a public forum at the pier on 29 July, Secretary for Development Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor repeated the government's insistence that keeping the pier was not an option.

Hoardings were erected by the end of July, and the target date for completing \\"preservation works\\" was set as November. It was suggested for the pier's pitched roof to be disassembled into halves and the 34 concrete columns to be cut at roof and deck level. The pieces would be labelled and then lifted by a crane barge and transported to the government's explosives depot in Kau Shat Wan, Lantau Island, where it would be stored under guard.Diana Lee & Scarlett Chiang, Queen's Pier to be cut up and stored at month's end , The Standard, 19 July 2007.

However, in July 2008 activists cried foul when eight councils revealed that the preservation of the pier in its existing location was not put forth as one of the options; the vice-chairmen of two councils which voted to support also objected that their decision may have not been an informed one as not all possible options were on the table. The chief town planner said that the omitted proposal \\"was not an efficient option and would create unnecessary construction waste\\".\\"Councils not told of third option before vote\\", Pg C3 South China Morning Post, 15 July 2008 After it was revealed in August 2008 that the government was behind the 13 concerted District Councils' motions in 2008 supporting the relocation of the pier to the new waterfront, Albert Ho condemned the government of tampering with District Councils to \\"create public opinion.\\" Convenor of the Urban Design Alliance doubted the openness of consultation, saying that \\"the government had engineered its results\\". Dr Li Pang-kwong, of Lingnan University, said that the problematic framework of the councils has led them to work too closely with government. He said the 'copy and paste' Queen's Pier motions passed by 13 councils to support government decisions was a rubber-stamp, and a clear sign that councils lacked independence. Conservationists' position Ron Phillips, original designer of the pier, backed preservation, saying that any loss of the City Hall and the adjacent open space would be something \\"future generations will come to regret\\". The Hong Kong Institute of Architects denounced the government's insistence that dismantling and reassembling of the pier was the only feasible option, in disregard of the pier's \\"grade 1\\" status. The architects concluded that the \\"technical difficulties were not irresolvable, and the government's reasons for not revising the current infrastructural design were not at all convincing\\". Environmental groups were angered by the government's technobabble, and for inflating the costs and technical difficulties of keeping the pier at the original site.Audrey Parwani, \\"Anger over plan to dismantle pier\\", South China Morning Post, 27 March 2007, page B1 The proposed 40-metre-wide road, planned in the 1980s, was now \\"obsolete\\", and would make the waterfront \\"inaccessible to the publicAudrey Parwani, \\"Don't kid the public on when the pier will be rebuilt, party says\\", South China Morning Post, 7 June 2007, page C4 \\". Albert Lai, Chairman of the Hong Kong People's Council for Sustainable Development, drew attention to the fact that the budgeted spending for infrastructure over the past three years of HK$90 billion contrasted poorly with HK$90 million spent on acquiring and renovating heritage sites. The Civic Party accused the government of misleading the public: the development plans for the North Island Line precluded the restoration of the pier before 2016.

History One of Stockholm's largest parks, the area covers about 9 hectares and measures approximately 430 √ó 270 meters. Development first started in 1885. In 1893 about 2,000 trees and shrubs were planted. The park was largely completed in 1903. The area is named after Vanadis, which is another name for the Norse Goddess Freyja. Reservoir Vanadislunden is the site of Vanadislundens water reservoir, (Vanadislundens vattenreservoar). A significant water reservoir, with a volume of 8,100 m¬≥, it was erected during the years 1913‚Äì1918. It has a castle-like design and was designed by architect Gustaf Am√©en (1864-1949). Artwork On a hill in the northwestern part of the park is the sculpture \\"Flicka i aftonsol\\". The statue was carved in 1955 by Swedish sculptor Anders J√∂nsson (1883-1965). There are also notable artworks by Carl Eldh and Einar Forseth at St Stephen's Church (see below). St Stephen's Church St. Stephen's Church (Sankt Stefans Kyrka or Stefanskyrkan) is situated in the southern part of the park. The original church was built of wood in 1899, but architect Carl M√∂ller began in 1901 to draw up designs for a more substantial building. The present church was completed and consecrated in 1904. (The original wooden church was relocated to the Aspudden area of the city, and rededicated to Saint Sigfrid of Sweden.) The church is built on a steep slope, with a significant difference of ground level on its two sides, but the building rests solidly on a large granite foundation. There is a notable carved crucifix by Carl Eldh on the southern gable end of the building. Inside, the sanctuary of the church is dominated by a large and striking triptych by artist Einar Forseth, painted for the church in the 1920s.

WWE would reintroduce the design for the unbranded World Heavyweight Championship in 2002, incorporating their logo. The Big Gold Belt is a historic professional wrestling championship belt that has represented multiple world championships throughout its history. Originally designed in 1985 by silversmith Charles Crumrine and commissioned by Jim Crockett Promotions for NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair, the championship belt has three large gold plates with a distinctive name plate onto which the champion's name was etched. While not the first wrestling championship belt to incorporate a name plate, it popularized the concept. The original championship belt design was known for being unbranded as it only read \\"World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion\\" and bore no initials or trademark of its owning promotion. In 2003, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) added its logo to the design for copyright purposes. Following the championship belt's introduction in WWE, the distinctive name plate feature of the Big Gold Belt was swiftly incorporated into the belt designs of other WWE championships.  History = NWA World Heavyweight Championship  The Big Gold Belt was first introduced in 1986 to replace the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt that had been used since 1973, historically known as the \\"domed globe\\" and nicknamed by both wrestlers and fans the \\"Ten Pounds of Gold\\". Jim Crockett Jr. of Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) commissioned Charles Crumrine, a silversmith in Reno, Nevada that specialized in rodeo-style belt buckles, to produce it. The championship belt debuted on February 14, 1986 at a Championship Wrestling from Florida card called \\"Battle of the Belts II\\", where NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair defended the title against Barry Windham. In 1988, JCP was purchased by media mogul and TBS founder Ted Turner. He established it as World Championship Wrestling (WCW) under partnership with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and continued promoting the NWA World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair.  WCW World Heavyweight Championship  Diamond Dallas Page as WCW World Heavyweight Champion In January 1991, WCW officially recognized Ric Flair as their world champion in conjunction with the NWA's recognition. During this time, the Big Gold Belt represented the NWA World Heavyweight Championship as well as the newly established WCW World Heavyweight Championship. An exception to this arose in the spring of 1991. On March 21, 1991, Tatsumi Fujinami defeated Flair at the WCW/New Japan Supershow. Following this match, the NWA recognized Fujinami as their new champion. However, WCW did not recognize this title change. While Flair would defeat Fujinami at SuperBrawl I on May 19, 1991 to reunify the NWA and WCW world titles, during Fujinami's approximately two-month reign as NWA World Heavyweight Champion, Flair retained possession of the championship belt and it only represented the WCW World Heavyweight Champion. \\"Real World's Heavyweight Championship\\"  In July 1991, Flair and WCW parted ways while Flair was still champion. The Big Gold Belt left with Flair due to a dispute with WCW Vice President Jim Herd in which Herd refused to return Flair's $25,000 deposit, a deposit per regulations that was required of reigning NWA World Heavyweight Champions and was to be returned after the conclusion of their reigns. WCW was forced to strip Flair of their recognition of world champion and introduced a new title belt design to continue to represent the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The NWA followed suit and also stripped Flair of their recognition of world champion. Flair soon signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) and exhibited the Big Gold Belt there, proclaiming himself \\"The Real World's Heavyweight Champion\\" until WCW sued, upon which Flair instead used a WWF World Tag Team title belt, digitized out on television, on the (kayfabe) orders of WWF President Jack Tunneyhttp://www.angelfire.com/pa5/wcwhistory/wcwintlchampionship.html until Flair won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at the 1992 Royal Rumble, thereby unifying it with his own claim.(Pointing at WWF World championship belt) \\"That's why he is - and you can call him - the Real World's Heavyweight Champion.\\" Bobby Heenan, postmatch interview, Royal Rumble 1992, Pay Per View TV broadcast by Titan Sports transmitted January 19, 1992. Quote occurs at 1:23\\"He'll be claiming to be the World Wrestling Federation Champion. He'll be claiming to be the Real World's Champion.

Postmatch TV interview comments, Wrestlemania VIII, Pay Per View TV broadcast by Titan Sports transmitted April 5, 1992. Flair stated on the 2008 DVD release of Nature Boy Ric Flair: The Definitive Collection that the $25,000 he initially deposited with additional interest totalling $38,000 was never paid back to him, and as a result, Flair kept the Big Gold Belt until a settlement was finally reached with WCW. With its return to WCW, the Big Gold Belt represented the NWA World Heavyweight Championship once again, being awarded to Masa Chono after his August 1992 tournament final victory over Rick Rude for the vacant title in New Japan Pro Wrestling. Meanwhile the new WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt design that had been commissioned after Flair's departure also continued to be used.Flair takes Big gold to WWF - PW Insider.com  WCW International World Heavyweight Championship  In September 1993, WCW formally seceded from the NWA and with that the promotional rights to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship were returned to the NWA. With the Big Gold Belt remaining property of WCW, Ric Flair who won NWA World Heavyweight Championship in July was recognized by WCW as holding the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship, the world championship of a supposed subsidiary of WCW called \\"WCW International\\". The WCW International World Heavyweight Championship was represented by the Big Gold Belt until June 1994, when it was unified with the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The Big Gold Belt became the WCW World Heavyweight Championship again. The Big Gold Belt remained the top title in WCW until the end of the promotion in 2001.  WCW bought by the WWF  In March 2001, after the long and bitter rivalry of the Monday Night Wars, World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. bought out WCW. The Big Gold Belt became property of the WWF and continued to represent the abbreviated WCW Championship within the promotion during the period of the WCW/ECW \\"Invasion\\". After the conclusion of Invasion at the Survivor Series in November 2001, the WCW Championship being held by The Rock became known simply as the World Championship for the month that followed as the WCW name was phased out. The title was unified with the WWF Championship at Vengeance in December 2001.WCW World Champion - Chris Jericho at WWE.com Chris Jericho became the final recognized titleholder and the subsequent undisputed champion in the WWF and professional wrestling.  Undisputed WWF Championship  Chris Jericho held the Big Gold Belt six times in WWE over the course of a decade under three different incarnations, with two WCW Championship reigns during The Invasion, one reign with the Undisputed WWF Championship, and three reigns as World Heavyweight Champion Following the unification of the World Championship (formerly WCW Championship) and WWF Championship in December 2001, the Big Gold Belt and the WWF Championship belt were collectively used to represent the Undisputed WWF Championship (those who held the championship belts after Jericho are credited as having held only the WWF Championship). After Jericho was defeated by Triple H at WrestleMania X8, the two title belts were replaced by a single Undisputed WWF Championship belt (later WWE), which was first exhibited by Triple H on April 1, 2002.Unified titles - WWE.com  Unbranded World Heavyweight Championship  Randy Orton, a four-time World Heavyweight Champion, seen here holding the most recent version of Big Gold Belt as a component of the WWE World Heavyweight Championship By 2002, the WWF had been divided in what became known as the brand extension and the promotion along with its parent company were renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). The roster was divided into two franchises or \\"WWE brands\\", split between Raw and SmackDown!. The WWE Undisputed Champion appeared on both shows and defended against challengers from both brands. After SummerSlam in August 2002, WWE Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar announced that he had signed an exclusive contract with SmackDown, ignoring the claim to the title's number-one contendership by Raw's Triple H. Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff said that the WWE Undisputed Championship was thus very much disputed, and he awarded the World Heavyweight Championship, in the form of the Big Gold Belt, to Triple H. A new version of the belt, incorporating a WWE logo for copyright purposes, was introduced in March 2003. On December 15, 2013 at the TLC: Tables, Ladders & Chairs pay-per- view, the title was unified with the WWE Championship when WWE Champion Randy Orton defeated World Heavyweight Champion John Cena, and was officially retired.  WWE World Heavyweight Championship  On December 15, 2013, the Big Gold Belt was used in conjunction with the existing WWE Championship belt to represent the unified championship known as the WWE World Heavyweight Championship (the name has since reverted to the WWE Championship). However, much like how Chris Jericho carried both physical title belts as Undisputed WWF Champion, the title history for the World Heavyweight Championship was retired as this lineage follows that of WWE's original world title. On the August 18, 2014, episode of Raw, a single, redesigned WWE Championship belt was presented to then-champion Brock Lesnar, and the Big Gold Belt was finally retired.Unified titles - WWE.com  References  * The History of the World Heavyweight Championship, WWE Home Video, 2009.

The largest of the city's three commercial districts, it is the location of many corporate or regional headquarters; city, county, state and federal government facilities; Georgia State University; sporting venues; and most of Atlanta's tourist attractions. It measures approximately four square miles, and had 26,700 residents as of 2010.Downtown Atlanta Residential Report , accessed Feb. 21, 2012 Similar to other central business districts in the United States, it has recently undergone a transformation that included the construction of new condos and lofts, renovation of historic buildings, and arrival of new residents and businesses.  Geography  Downtown is bound by North Avenue to the north, Boulevard to the east, Interstate 20 to the south, and Northside Drive to the west. This definition of Downtown includes central areas like Five Points, the Hotel District and Fairlie-Poplar and outlying inner city neighborhoods such as SoNo and Castleberry Hill. The Atlanta Downtown Improvement District (ADID) organization, though, defines a much smaller downtown area measuring just one and two tenths square miles. This area is roughly bound by North Avenue to the north, Piedmont Avenue and the Downtown Connector to the east, Martin Luther King Junior Drive, Courtland Street, and Edgewood Avenue to the south, and the railroad tracks to the west. This area only includes the core central business district neighborhoods of Fairlie-Poplar, Five Points, the Hotel District, Centennial Hill, and South Downtown.  History  Downtown Atlanta, 1889 The history of downtown began in 1826 with Wilson Lumpkin and Hamilton Fulton surveying a possible canal route between Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Milledgeville, Georgia's capital at the time.ATLANTA HISTORY, 1782-1859, accessed June 8, 2008 In 1833, Lumpkin, who had become governor, requested that the state legislature charter three railroad lines. By 1836, the state-financed Western and Atlantic Railroad, linking the middle of Georgia to the other states north and west, was granted a charter by the legislature, which was signed into law by Lumpkin. As a result, the town named Terminus was founded in 1837, named for the end of the railroad line.New Georgia Encyclopedia: Atlanta, accessed on July 29, 2009 Terminus received a name change in 1842 when the town's 30 inhabitants voted to change the town's name to Marthasville, in honor of Governor Lumpkin's daughter.History of Atlanta - 1792 to the 1900s, accessed July 29, 2009 By 1845, John Edgar Thomson, chief engineer of the Georgia Railroad, suggested that Marthasville's name be changed. The first suggestion was \\"Atlantica- Pacifica,\\" which was shortened to \\"Atlanta.\\"CAP/ADID Having Fun - Atlanta History , accessed June 8, 2008 In 1847, Atlanta was incorporated, with the town limits extending in a one-mile (1.6 km) radius from the mile marker at the railroad depot. By the outbreak of the Civil War, Atlanta was a major railroad hub and manufacturing center, making it a target for the Union Army. In 1864, General William T. Sherman burned Atlanta to the ground during his \\"March to the Sea,\\" making Atlanta the only major American city to ever be destroyed by war. Peachtree Street, 1882 Atlanta's first resurgence began during Reconstruction. In 1868, Georgia's state capital was moved to the city from Milledgeville. By the 1920s, a downtown business sector ringed by residential districts had emerged. Professional sports came to Atlanta in 1965 with the construction of Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium and the relocation of the Braves from Milwaukee. The National Football League awarded the city the Falcons expansion team in 1966. The Hawks arrived in 1968, even though Omni Coliseum, the city's basketball arena, did not open until 1972. Two of the teams continue to play their home games downtown at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and Philips Arena. Downtown commuters waiting for a bus in 1974 Business growth in the 1970s resulted in significant development in Downtown, most notably in Peachtree Center and the Hotel District. Economic development in these areas shifted the commercial center of the city to an area along Peachtree Street that was north of Five Points, however, despite the construction of the MARTA central station there in 1975. By the mid-1980s, Peachtree Center had become the core of a dedicated hotel-convention district that lay at the heart of the Downtown economy, even as the remainder of Downtown Atlanta deteriorated markedly.Theorizing the City: The New Urban Anthropology Reader, edited by Setha M. Low, pp. 324-35 The closure of Underground Atlanta in 1979 due to an increase in crime contributed to perceptions that Downtown was dangerous, and the 1980s saw a significant decline in population. By 1990, Five Points was a \\"vacant shell of its former self,\\" while Downtown as a whole was largely an \\"archepelagic assemblage of fortified enclaves inhabited in the daylight hours by government office workers, conventioners, and college students, and in the night by a substantial population of homeless persons.\\"Theorizing the City: The New Urban Anthropology Reader, edited by Setha M. Low, p. 318 The 1996 Olympic Games, along with the transformation of Georgia State University from a commuter school to a traditional college, initiated a resurgence of Downtown that continues today. They resulted in Centennial Olympic Park, which was built as a physical memorial to the games in the former industrial area west of Five Points. In the following decade, Centennial Olympic Park spurred the creation of a Downtown tourist district anchored by the World of Coca-Cola, the Georgia Aquarium, the CNN Center, the Center for Civil and Human Rights, and the College Football Hall of Fame. Following the 1996 games, Georgia State University president Carl Patton, an urban planner, initiated a University-led transformation of Downtown that sought to make Georgia State \\"a part of the city, not apart from the city.\\" Dubbed the Main Street Master Plan, Patton's vision has been executed through billions of dollars of urban construction, boosting Downtown's economy and population.The University As Urban Developer: Case Studies And Analysis, edited by David C. Perry and Wim Wiewel, p. 139 On March 14, 2008, at approximately 9:40 PM Eastern Daylight Time, an EF2 tornado hit Downtown with winds up to . It caused damage to Philips Arena, the Georgia Dome, Centennial Olympic Park, the Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel, the CNN Center, and the Georgia World Congress Center. This was the first time a tornado touched ground in Downtown since weather records keeping began in the 1880s. While there were dozens of injuries, there was only one fatality.Tornado Claims One in Polk County by Tim Eberly and Paul Shea for the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, March 15, 2008.

Louis Nowra wrote the screenplay, and Helen Leake and Nik Powell produced the film. The film won an Australian Film Institute award in 2003 for David Ngoombujarra as Best Actor in a Supporting Role.  Plot  Based on real events, it tells the story of Max Stuart (Ngoombujarra), a young aboriginal man who was sentenced to death after being found guilty of the murder of a nine-year-old girl on what was considered questionable evidence. It follows the fight by his lawyers David O'Sullivan (Carlyle) and Helen Devaney (Fox) to save Stuart from execution, as well as Crown Prosecutor, Roderic Chamberlain's (Dance) efforts to convict Stuart. Rohan Rivett editor of an Adelaide paper, The News, and its publisher, Rupert Murdoch (Ben Mendelsohn) also feature as leading the public response in the campaign to save Stuart. In the final scene of the film, Max Stuart appeared as himself as an older man, driving along a dirt highway near Alice Springs where he lived at the time, and saying: \\"Yeah, some people think I'm guilty and some people think I'm not.

Hutchinson was born in Derby and started his career with non-league Burton Albion before signing for Cambridge United. In July 1968 he joined Chelsea for ¬£5000. Chelsea coach Ron Suart had journeyed to Cambridge to watch a goalkeeper, but instead recommended Hutchinson to manager Dave Sexton. Hutchinson was a striker noted for his impressive heading ability and for taking long throw-ins. On his debut against Ipswich Town, he sent in a series of long throws which reached the opposite side of the penalty area, confusing both the opposing defenders and the crowd and one of which an Ipswich defender inadvertently put into his own net. At Chelsea he proved to be the perfect foil for the more technically gifted Peter Osgood after a sparkling debut partnership in which both players scored in a 3‚Äì1 win against Sheffield Wednesday. During the 1969-70 season they scored 53 goals between them. That season turned out to be Hutchinson's most successful, as he scored an impressive 16 goals in 26 league appearances. Hutchinson is most notable for his part in Chelsea winning the FA Cup that same season. In the final against Leeds United, he was often in the thick of the action. In the first match at Wembley his headed flick-on teed up Peter Houseman for Chelsea's first equaliser and he was later floored by a challenge from Leeds' Norman Hunter. Leeds took the lead with six minutes to go, but two minutes later Hutchinson, still limping from Hunter's challenge, headed in John Hollins' cross to take the game to a replay. Two weeks later at Old Trafford, with the game tied at 1-1 going into extra time, Hutchinson launched one of his trademark long throw-ins into the Leeds penalty area and it was headed in by David Webb to win the cup for Chelsea. Despite more impressive performances in the following years at Chelsea, the remainder of his career was blighted by injuries, including two broken legs, a broken arm, a broken toe and persistent knee trouble, which kept him out of the side's successful Cup Winners' Cup run the following year and limited him to just 4 appearances in the 1972-73 season. He retired in July 1976 aged 27, having been unable to conquer his injury woes. He made 144 appearances for Chelsea and scored 58 goals. All that remained of his playing days was a brief stint with non-League Dartford FC, www.independent.co.uk during which he often took to the field in immense pain. There followed a spell as Chelsea's commercial manager in the late 1970s and in more recent years Hutchinson worked in corporate hospitality for several clubs. He died in September 2002 after a long illness.

History The square was conceived together with the urban development plan of 1883, that, amongst other things, provided for the urbanization of the whole Aventine Hill, the enlargement of the urbanization in Testaccio towards Via Marmorata, and of San Saba. It was a district that, since then, had been left substantially rural and little inhabited: this allowed to trace the almost straight paths of the present Viale Aventino and Via della Piramide Cestia. The square was initially called Piazza Raudusculana, as it is placed where the former Porta Raudusculana (no more existing) rose; it changed its name on July 4, 1940 and became Piazza Albania to commemorate the annexation of Albania to the Kingdom of Italy, that had taken place the previous year. The square lies at the vertex of a vaste green triangle (now called Parco della Resistenza dell'8 Settembre) and is surrounded by buildings erected between the 1930s and the 1960s.

At the end of a series of intellectual sparings within the publication itself, Crainic managed to wrest control of the magazine and institute a sea-change in editorial character supporting mystical Orthodoxy. He developed an ideology given the name G√¢ndirism (from g√¢nd ‚Äì \\"thought\\"), a nationalist and neo- Orthodox Christian social and cultural trend. He edited the G√¢ndirea magazine, and collaborated with numerous other publications such as Ramuri, Rom√¢nia NouƒÉ, Cuv√¢ntul, and SfarmƒÉ-PiatrƒÉ. He was also the editor in chief of the newspaper Calendarul. Nichifor Crainic became a leading pro-Fascist figure in the political turmoil of the late 1930s, openly praising Mussolini and Hitler. He was an ideologue of antisemitism, although his prejudice was a defense of the Gospels rather than a vision of racial hierarchies. His beliefs were a major influence on the Iron Guard legionary movement, although Crainic viewed himself as a supporter of the legionnaires' rival King Carol II. In a 1938 essay, he theoretised the \\"ethnocratic state\\" as applied to Romania:Crainic, Programul statului etnocratic apud A fulfillment of ethnocracy was to be achieved through the means of a monarch-led corporatist system: In 1940 he was elected a member of the Romanian Academy. He studied theology at the Seminary in Bucharest, and received his Ph.D. diploma from the University of Vienna. He was appointed Minister of Propaganda for the Ion Antonescu regime. After the Soviet army defeated the Germans and occupied Romania, Crainic went into hiding. A trial was conducted in his absence and he was found guilty of crimes against the people. He was eventually caught and imprisoned by the Romanian authorities in 1947, and spent 15 years in VƒÉcƒÉre≈üti and Aiud prisons. He was expelled from the Academy by the Communist regime. Between 1962 and 1968 he was the editor of the Communist propaganda magazine Glasul Patriei (\\"The Voice of the Motherland\\")‚Äîa magazine published in Romania by the Romanian Communist regime but sold only abroad, which they used as a tool to try to influence the Romanian intellectual √©migr√©s to be patriotic and not work against the Communist Romania.

The company formerly released music through its record label, Giant Step Records. Giant Step is divided into two entities ‚Äì the Giant Step brand, which promotes music and the creative agency, Giant Step Marketing, which provides marketing services to consumer brands.  History = The Groove Academy and early years  Groove Academy began in 1990 as a party in New York City. The party was a weekly production of British promoter, Maurice Bernstein, and his South African partner, Jonathan Rudnick. Initially unable to secure a loan from the bank, the pair borrowed money and used it to book acts and venues. \\"The stars of the 70s, although they were highly sampled, were not getting recognition and were not being presented in a live forum,\\" recalls Rudnick. The two called their events, Groove Academy with its slogan, \\"Dedicated to the preservation of Funk.\\"Mead, Rebecca, \\"The Brit Pack,\\" New York. August 26, 1991, p. 111 Bernstein recalled, \\"The first Groove Academy shows were put on by literally looking up artists in the telephone book ‚Ä¶ None of them had agents then, we‚Äôd just call them up at home and say ‚Äòare you interested in doing a show with us?‚Äô[38] The two called their events Groove Academy with its slogan, ‚ÄúDedicated to the preservation of Funk\\" and began rediscovering musicians whose records they had collected as teenagers. [10][9] [10] The events were extended onto the dance floor under the new name Giant Step, after the fabled John Coltrane album Giant Steps. The Giant Step party differentiated itself from Groove Academy with its emphasis on mixing Jazz and Hip Hop. Giant Step would soon go on tour around the States, Europe and Japan.  Giant Step party (1990s to early 2000s)  The Giant Step party started off as a weekly event that mixed live jazz and hiphop. While The Groove Academy staged concerts with Maceo Parker, Isaac hayes, The Ohio Players and George Clinton, [38] Bernstein and Rudnick extended onto the dancefloor with their Giant Step party. Greatly influenced by the acid jazz club-nights in England, like Gilles Peterson's Talkin' Loud And Sayin' Something,.[38] [39] Giant Step offered a stage where visiting rappers and jazz musicians, along with the regular Giant Step band, improvised to prerecorded hip-hop and funk.[40] Giant Step hold as emerging acid jazz artists, like the Digable Planets, The Brand New Heavies and Jamiroquai, launched their stateside careers there.[41] Many other notable artists debuted at Giant Step shows as well including The Fugees and Massive Attack. [42] The party originally took place at S.O.B.‚Äôs but later moved to other venues such as Metropolis Caf√©, Supper Club, Shine, New Music Caf√© and the Village Gate. [43] In 2002 the weekly party was discontinued. Later the Giant Step party would be re-launched at the Hudson Hotel. Giant Step's events expanded into select markets outside of New York City, including shows in Los Angeles, Miami, Chicago and Washington DC.[37]  Record label  As the events continued to expand in the mid 1990s, Giant Step moved into management, signing Dana Bryant, Repercussions (band), and Groove Collective, securing record deals for the three on Warner Brothers. Other artists managed include Raw Stylus, whom Giant Step signed to Geffen Records. During this time Giant Step worked with Gary Katz, best known for his work with Steely Dan, to help produce the albums for Groove Collective, Repercussions (band) and Raw Stylus. In 1995, record producer Tommy Lipuma took over GRP Records at MCA Records and invited Giant Step to set up there as an imprint label. The first act to be signed to the label was the jazz group, Groove Collective. In early 1997, Giant Step achieved acclaim for their work with Nuyorican Soul and a partnership with Gilles Peterson‚Äôs label, Talkin Loud. The group was a collaboration between Latin house DJs, \\"Little\\" Louie Vega and Kenny \\"Dope\\" Gonzales, who were also commonly known as Masters at Work. Nuyorican Soul featured many real musicians as opposed to sampled or synthesized sounds. Musicians who took part in the project included George Benson, Tito Puente, Roy Ayers, Jazzy Jeff, Jocelyn Brown, and salsa queen, India. Three singles from the first Nuyorican Soul album made it to the top of the Billboard Charts; \\"Runaway\\", \\"You Can Do It (Baby)\\" and \\"I Am The Black Gold Of The Sun.\\" The album, released in March 2007, sold over 50,000 units by the end of July the same year. Epic Records soon approached Bernstein and Rudnick with an offer. Although Giant Step was a music label, Epic Records was primarily interested in Giant Step's marketing capabilities and offered the company a retainer contract where their record label was a secondary priority.  Music marketing and label discontinuation  For their first project with Epic Records, Giant Step helped launch the career of Macy Gray, followed by Jill Scott and the re-launch of Sade. The company promoted Macy Gray by getting her music played in caf√©s, clubs, and restaurants. According to Rose Noone, VP of A&R; at Epic Records, the music was \\"heard everywhere.\\" Giant Step went on to help Def Jam Records artist Musiq Soulchild by pushing his music in untapped markets. The previously unknown singer sold 55,000 copies of his debut album in its first week. Although, Giant Step Records released a Gilles Peterson compilation with Epic Records, Bernstein and Rudnick eventually grew frustrated with having an imprint deal. Corporate management denied their requests to sign artists like India Arie and Donnie, and so in 2000, Giant Step decided to start their own label. However the following year, Rudnick would leave company to pursue other interests. With money received from Epic, Bernstein started work on a series of tracks with singer, Donnie, that would eventually become the album, Welcome to the Colored Section. Steve \\"The Scotman\\" Harvey was enlisted as the Music producer. Singles from this album include, \\"Do You Know\\" and \\"Cloud9\\". Welcome to the Colored Section was called \\"the best soul record since Stevie Wonder's masterpieces of the 1970s,\\" by the Boston Globe. The independent success of Welcome to the Colored Section, brought a joint venture with Motown Records and private investment into the label. Giant Step has also released albums for Carl Hancock, Gilles Peterson, Turntables on the Hudson, Ultra Nate, Zero 7, Jody Watley, Donnie, Sara Devine, Jiva and Zap Mama. However the venture had many operating issues. Its financial troubles threatened Giant Step's marketing business and the company nearly shut down. After an expected second round of investment didn't come through, the label ground to a halt in 2005. With the record label closed, Giant Step focused its efforts on developing their marketing business. Giant Step soon entered a collaboration with Sade, and helped the artist sell 400,000 copies of her album during its first week in stores. In 2006, Universal Republic Records hired Giant Step to promote then-unknown Amy Winehouse ‚Äì the company's grassroots campaign was acknowledge for supporting Winehouse's cross over into the mainstream in 2007. Other notable artists that were launched through Giant Step's music marketing program include Lady Gaga, Janelle Mon√°e and Adele.  Creative agency era = 2000s  After an initial foray with Levi's Miles Ahead Music Series and LG, Giant Step expanded into brand marketing with their creative agency, Giant Step Marketing. The company's work with the Levi's Miles Ahead Series debuted Jill Scott, Air and Massive Attack. The series also featured bands such as Femi Kuti, Kruder & Dorfmeister, Fatboy Slim, Morcheeba, Bebel Gilberto, and Terry Callier. For LG, the agency coordinated press outreach, online promotions, and venues to help launch LG‚Äôs new mobile phone line. Events included performances by Jurassic 5, Thievery Corporation, The Pharcyde, Zero 7, Van Hunt, Miss Kittin, Raphael Saadiq, and Everything But The Girl. Between 2007 and 2011, Giant Step Marketing produced music events for Ian Schrager's Morgans Hotel Group. This series included two years of Grammy and Fashion week events and featured artists such as The Roots, Common, Grace Jones, Erykah Badu, Janelle Mon√°e, Estelle, De La Soul, and The Kills. In 2009, Svedka was brought in as a sponsor and the programs were expanded into the Svedka Future Music Series. Notable musicians featured in the series include Robyn, Wale, Mark Ronson, N.E.R.D., Fitz & the Tantrums, Janelle Mon√°e, and Daft Punk. From 2008 to 2011, Giant Step Marketing launched Steve Madden Music.

Notable campaigns (2011 and beyond)  In 2011, Giant Step worked with music producer David Guetta to create awareness for Coca-Cola‚Äôs energy drink, Burn. Later in 2011 Giant Step Marketing promoted the launch of Barneys New York‚Äôs \\"Gaga‚Äôs Workshop,\\" a holiday collaboration with Lady Gaga. The company provided PR, social media, digital and experiential campaigns. In 2012, Giant Step Marketing launched Absolut X for Absolut Vodka, a multi-year, integrated marketing program aimed at pairing music, art, & cocktails together. The program included 6 events in major markets in the form of a masquerade ball, content, traditional advertising and a digital campaign. The experiential program won a gold Ex Award in 2013 (\\"Best Production of An Event\\") and garnered media coverage from national media outlets. Giant Step Marketing produced and promoted the \\"Music Experiment 2.0\\" concert series in 2013 for Intel and Viacom. The series featured artists such as Arcade Fire, Empire of the Sun, and Disclosure and was broadcast on MTV Iggy and via livestream; the Arcade Fire show was also broadcast on \\"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\\" in partnership with ABC. The Intel series was later recognized with a silver Clio Award in 2014. In 2014, Giant Step Marketing worked with Western Union to create a viral holiday campaign that would surprise real customers. The stunt was staged and filmed in Western Union's Times Square location, where customers were called in under the guise of \\"business,\\" only to be greeted with a custom tent, decorated with family and country mementos, and their favorite home cooked meal. The campaign was credited for aiding in the \\"[skyrocketing] of social engagement at Western Union,\\" and recognized with a Shorty Award in 2015. Bernstein was tapped by Samsung Electronics America in 2015 to serve as interim general manager of its planned flagship experience center, and to oversee the opening of the building. Bernstein and Giant Step Marketing operated as Samsung's in-house agency, with the sole focus of launching Samsung 837 in 2016.

The building, which has been recognized as a forerunner in the experiential retail category and was awarded \\"Best Store Design of the Year,\\" showcases Samsung's technology in all of its programming. In 2017, Giant Step Marketing was engaged by W Hotels and Marriott International to develop an integrated music platform, which eventually became W Records, the world's first-ever hotel music label. In its first year, W Records signed and released new music from artists such as Amber Mark, Perfume Genius, Roosevelt and Japanese Breakfast. In September 2019, Giant Step was recognized with a bronze Clio Award for W Records, in the \\"Integrated Campaign\\" category.

Plot introduction The novel is set in the reasonably near future. Earth is being devastated by mankind's continued exploitation, and it seems obvious that the environment will collapse sometime in the near future. Rather than adopt a more eco-friendly approach to life, most people have instead invested in a \\"claustrosphere\\", a dome-shaped habitat in which all water, food and air is endlessly recycled in a completely closed environment. A person can therefore survive indefinitely within a claustrosphere no matter what ecological horrors may happen outside. Plot summary The bulk of the book focuses on a British writer, Nathan, who is attempting to sell an idea for a claustrosphere commercial to Plastic Tolstoy, owner and chief marketer of the company which builds them. The commercial represents a change in emphasis for the advertising campaign; up to now claustropheres have been sold as a kind of fall-back insurance, just in case the environment collapses. However, now that virtually everybody owns at least a basic model, sales are falling and the company is having to try and sell upgrade and improvement packages instead. The new advertising, therefore, attempts to convince people for the first time that the environment truly is doomed and they are inevitably going to have to live in their claustrospheres. Tolstoy accepts Nathan's idea and assigns him to work with Max, a shallow and pretentious young actor. During a subsequent meeting with Tolstoy, Nathan makes a joking suggestion that it would be ironic if his company actually covertly sponsored the eco-terrorism movement led by Jurgen Thor, which despises the claustrosphere company since it represents, in their eyes, an abrogation of mankind's responsibility to care for the environment. Nathan is subsequently murdered as he plays a virtual reality game with Max. Max sets out to investigate the murder, falling in with Rosalie Connolly, an eco-terrorist working for Thor's organization. Max ultimately discovers that Thor and Tolstoy are in fact partners. The eco-terrorists raids, whilst highly successful, never present more than a minor problem to the vast claustrosphere company, but do grab headlines and bring awareness of the looming eco-disaster into the public mind - prompting them to buy more claustrospheres. Tolstoy confesses that he has even geared his advertising campaign to work in perfect sync with the terrorists, with new commercials ready to roll out instantly after each attack. After a confrontation between Max, Rosalie and Jurgen in which Jurgen is killed, Tolstoy decides to evade justice by leaking news indicating that the ecology is finally collapsing. The news is suddenly full of stories of environmental catastrophe, and people are told that they need to lock themselves in their claustrospheres for several decades. The \\"rat run\\", as it is termed, removes the large bulk of humanity from the world, effectively ending the current civilization. Allusions/references to actual history, geography and current science In one of the novel's great ironies, one of the by-products of the vanishing of global society is that all industry ceases, ending further pollution of the environment. Freed of this burden, Earth begins to gradually recover from the damage inflicted so far. As with Elton's other early novels, This Other Eden is a satire advocating greater environmentalism.

The group consisted of vocalist and bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker of Blink-182, lead guitarist Shane Gallagher of The Nervous Return, and rhythm guitarist Craig Fairbaugh of Mercy Killers. Hoppus and Barker created +44 shortly after the initial 2005 breakup of Blink-182 and before it was later reformed. The band's name refers to the international dialing code of the United Kingdom, the country where the duo first discussed the project. Early recordings were largely electronic in nature, and featured vocals by Carol Heller, formerly of the all-girl punk quartet Get the Girl. The band's sound gradually took on a heavier tone as Hoppus and Barker purchased a studio in which to record. Although anticipated by the music press, the band's debut‚Äîthe album When Your Heart Stops Beating (2006)‚Äîdid not match commercial expectations and received mixed reviews from the critics. The group toured worldwide throughout 2006 and 2007, including a summer slot on the Honda Civic Tour alongside Fall Out Boy. Hoppus later began preparing material for a solo album, put plans for a second +44 album on hold in 2008, and the group entered an extended hiatus with the reunion of Blink-182 in 2009. History=Blink-182 problems and hiatus By 2004, Blink-182‚Äîconsisting of bassist Mark Hoppus, guitarist Tom DeLonge, and drummer Travis Barker‚Äîhad emerged as the biggest pop punk act of the era, releasing the multiplatinum album Enema of the State (1999) and Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001), which reached number one. The band took a brief break in 2002 when DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back. During this time, he collected several darker musical ideas he felt unsuitable for Blink-182, compiling them in the album Box Car Racer. This latter was recorded with the help of Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy, and was intended as a one-time experimental project, but evolved into a full-fledged band, with Barker behind the kit. This side project would cause great division between DeLonge and Hoppus, who was not included and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter and music on Box Car Racer edged its way into the Blink sound as well, and the band explored experimentalist elements on their next effort, the eponymous fifth studio album Blink-182 (2003). Tom DeLonge's departure from Blink-182 was rooted in limited creative freedom. The trio embarked on a European tour the following fall, during which DeLonge felt increasingly conflicted both about his creative freedom within the group and the toll touring was taking on his family life. He eventually expressed his desire to take a half-year respite from touring, in order to spend more time with his family. Hoppus and Barker were dismayed by his decision, which they felt was an overly long break. DeLonge did not blame his band-mates for being disappointed with his requests, but was himself dismayed that they could not seemingly understand. In addition, DeLonge protested the idea of Barker's reality television series Meet the Barkers, which was being produced for a 2005 premiere. He disliked television cameras everywhere, feeling his personal privacy invaded. Following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, DeLonge agreed to perform at Music for Relief's Concert for South Asia, a benefit show to aid victims. Further arguments ensued during rehearsals, rooted in the band member's increasing paranoia and bitterness toward one another. He considered his band-mates priorities very different, coming to the conclusion that the trio had simply grew apart as they aged, had families, and reached fame. The breakdown in communication led to heated exchanges, resulting in his exit from the group. It was announced on February 22, 2005 that Blink-182 would be going on an \\"indefinite hiatus\\". DeLonge would not speak to Barker or Hoppus‚Äîwhom he once considered his greatest friends‚Äîfor several years. Despite this, Geffen Records president Jordan Schur reportedly told Barker that \\"any press you do, make sure you say everything is cool\\".  +44 formation (2005)  Hoppus and Barker began laying down new ideas. Recording in Barker's basement and Hoppus' dining room, by necessity everything was electronic, with the two musicians experimenting with electronic drums, samples, keyboards and direct computer recordings. While away on a trip in April 2005, Hoppus participated in an interview with MTV News in which he revealed the band's existence. When the two regrouped, they decided to stop giving interviews about the new project. The band's name is a reference to the country code needed when placing a phone call to the United Kingdom, where Hoppus and Barker first discussed making music alone. The basement recordings were ambient and quiet by necessity. When Your Heart Stops Beating (2006‚Äì07) The addition of other members to +44 came gradually. In April 2005, Barker invited his friend Carol Heller to provide vocals on a track. Formerly of the all-girl punk quartet Get the Girl, Heller traded and shared vocals with Hoppus on most of the band's early demos. Meanwhile, Hoppus invited friend Shane Gallagher to play the guitar on a few tracks the band began working on, and he was soon drafted as a member. Production of the record moved along swiftly once the duo purchased their own North Hollywood studio, which they dubbed Opera Music. The space‚Äîwhich featured two recording rooms, a lounge, and a small outdoor courtyard‚Äîwas purchased in October 2005 from former Poison guitarist Richie Kotzen. After moving all band gear into the new recording center, the entire direction of the band evolved into a more organic sound. Heller became uneasy with the new direction and, with a desire to start a family, parted ways with the band by the end of the year. Shortly afterward, friend Craig Fairbaugh came in to observe, listen, and to play songs; by the end of the day, Hoppus and Barker asked him to become the fourth member of the group. The band's debut album, When Your Heart Stops Beating, was produced by Hoppus and Barker, with longtime associate and friend Jerry Finn in the role of executive producer. The release date for When Your Heart Stops Beating was anticipated and publicized by the music press. As early as August 2005, Internet rumors began to circulate that the album would be released in January 2006, although the band's management denied the claims. Thanks to Hoppus' and Barker's silence on press interviews, misinformation flooded the Internet in the months prior to the record's release, and countless impostors posted fake songs online. \\"No, It Isn't\\" was leaked in December 2005 and caused speculation, as it addressed the break-up of Blink-182 head-on. Hoppus did not give any formal interviews prior to the release of the album, instead working on it in relative secrecy, spending time updating his blog, and producing tracks for Motion City Soundtrack. \\"During that time, their former bandmate, Tom DeLonge, did the opposite, peppering blogs and magazines with quotes hyping his new band and putting the blame for the Blink situation squarely on their shoulders\\", reported James Montgomery, of MTV News. Even though it pained them to do so, Hoppus and Barker refrained from speaking to the media, instead burying themselves in the studio for the recording of the album. When Your Heart Stops Beating was officially released November 13, 2006. In the United States, the album debuted at number 10 on the Billboard 200, with approximately 66,000 copies sold in its first week.Katie Hasty, \\"The Game Wins No. 1 On The Billboard 200\\", Billboard.com, November 22, 2006. The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics.When Your Heart Stops Beating - Metacritic. Metacritic. Retrieved on 2010-08-05. The New York Times described it as \\"zippier and catchier\\" than Angels & Airwaves' debut studio album We Don't Need to Whisper, but concluded that neither band was as good as Blink-182. As of September 2011, the album sold over 274,000 copies in the US. +44's first show took place at the Roxy Theatre in Hollywood, on September 7, 2006, with a second appearance following at the London Astoria.Shooman, 2010. p. 158 The band embarked on a promotional tour in the United Kingdom shortly thereafter. Barker was in constant pain but soldiered through the performances, altering his kit set-up to accommodate. A doctor informed Barker he had broken a bone in his arm during the band's video shoot, and was instructed to immediately rest and not take part in the band's upcoming live dates, including early 2007 jaunts to Australia and Europe. Barker nevertheless took part, but after an excruciating Amsterdam gig, the band drafted Gil Sharone, then of The Dillinger Escape Plan, to fill-in for him.Shooman, 2010. p. 163 The tour rolled on to Australia and Japan, where the band busied itself with press junkets and appearances. Crowds were, according to journalist Joe Shooman, mainly Blink-182 fans. Hoppus relished the opportunity to return to smaller, more intimate club dates, rather than the massive arenas of latter-day Blink. The band spent April to June 2007 on the Honda Civic Tour of the US and Canada alongside Fall Out Boy, The Academy Is‚Ä¶ and Paul Wall. The band began slipping old Blink songs‚Äî\\"What's My Age Again?\\" and \\"The Rock Show\\"‚Äîinto set lists, despite the band's rather adamant stance against doing so months before, apparently due to Hoppus and Barker fond feelings with Blink-182.Shooman, 2010. p. 166  Cancelled second studio album and hiatus (2008‚Äì09)  Further August 2007 dates were postponed. Hoppus stated the band had decided to re-enter the studio in preparation of a second studio album. Hoppus and Barker spent the remainder of the year in discussions with record companies before announcing that the planned next +44 album would see its release via Interscope Records.Shooman, 2010. p. 178 According to journalist Joe Shooman, little work commenced on the album.Shooman, 2010. p. 182 Barker started releasing hip-hop remixes on May 9, 2008, and he hoped to collate his growing collection of remixes with a bunch of new tracks on which he was working. Eventually, the project became a solo album, with Barker producing it all himself. By the following August, Hoppus began recording material for a possible solo studio album at Opera while Barker worked on his solo too, although the duo continued to work together. In September 2008, Barker and collaborator Adam Goldstein (DJ AM) were involved in a plane crash that killed four people, leaving the two the only survivors. Barker sustained second and third degree burns and developed post-traumatic stress disorder, and the accident resulted in sixteen surgeries and 48‚Äìhour blood transfusions. Former bandmate Tom DeLonge visited Barker in the hospital, and an October 2008 visit at Opera Music laid the grounds for what was to be the band's reunion. Blink-182 reunited in February 2009. Hoppus confirmed in an interview with Alternative Press that +44 was on hiatus, although in an interview with Blunt Magazine in March 2009, he indicated that it would continue. During an interview with Mark Hoppus' side-project Simple Creatures, Wall of Sound asked Mark would ever consider reuniting +44 to play shows again, to which he replied: Musical style and influences +44's original electronic influence is an undercurrent throughout the band's music, although electronic has been overtaken by guitar. Many tracks display a traditional punk sound (with a much more melodic touch), but also highlight electronica as a key influence. Many critics noticed the similarity between the sound of the music of +44 and Blink-182's final album before their break-up, Blink-182 (2003). Its similarity is featured by the soft verse and loud chorus explosion as heard on their single \\"Stay Together for the Kids\\". The band's debut studio album was largely inspired by other bands such as The Postal Service, Missing Persons, and The Cure.

It was ordered from √ñresundsvarvet in Landskrona, Sweden by Rederi AB Gotland as MS Gotland, but delivered as MS Wasa Star to Vaasanlaivat / Vasab√•tarna. Between 1984 and 2008 she sailed as MS Peter Wessel for Larvik Line (until 1996) and Color Line, before sold to her current owners. Concept and construction In the late 1970s the Swedish shipbuilding industry was suffering from a downturn, with little to no ships in order from Swedish shipyards. To help the industry the Swedish Prime Minister Ola Ullsten persuaded Rederi AB Gotland to order new ferries from √ñresundsvarvet in Landskrona. Although Rederi AB Gotland were reluctant to order new ships at first, in the end they decided to order two large, state-of-the-art ferries, capable of carrying over 2000 passengers. M/S Visby: Historik, retrieved 31 August 2007. The first ship, MS Visby, was delivered on 10 October 1980.Fakta om Fartyg: M/S Visby (1980), retrieved 31 August 2007. The second ship, planned to be called MS Gotland, was delivered on 24 June 1981 to Rederi Ab Gotland. However, there were not enough passengers in the traffic from Gotland to the Swedish mainland, on one day following her delivery the ship was chartered to Vaasanlaivat / Vasab√•tarna, Finland and officially named MS Wasa Star.  Service history =1981‚Äì1983: Vaasanlaivat and Karageorgios Line On 1 July 1981 the brand new Wasa Star started traffic on the route connecting Vaasa in Finland to Sundsvall in Sweden. At the time she was by far the largest ferry to have ever sailed in the Kvarken. In February 1982 the ship was moved to the Vaasa ‚Äì Ume√• route. On 14 February 1981 the ship was grounded near Holmsund. She soon came loose but her tanks were damaged, and the ship sailed to Helsinki for repairs. The local shipyard did not have a free drydock for the repairs and on 16 February 1981 the Wasa Star continued from Helsinki to Kiel, Germany where she was finally repaired at Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft. On 1 April 1982 the Wasa Star returned to the Vaasa ‚Äì Sundsvall route. She was not profitable however, and on 31 August 1982 she was taken out of traffic and laid up in Sundsvall. There she remained until May 1983, when Vaasanlaivat sub-chartered her to Karageorgios Line, Greece and she left Sundsvall for Valletta, Malta where she was docked in preparation for her new service. In June she started trafficking on a route connecting Patras, Greece to Ancona, Italy with one weekly trip from Ancona to Igoumenitsa, Greece. However, due to a payment dispute between Vaasanlaivat and Karageorgios Line Wasa Stars service in the Mediterranean remained short, and she sailed to Landskrona, Sweden to be laid up. 1983‚Äì1996: Larvik Line On 29 August 1983, after the various conflicting charter agreements were resolved, the Wasa Star was sold to the Norwegian operator Larvik Line. She left Landskrona on 13 January 1984. In March of the same year she was renamed MS Peter Wessel, after Peter Wessel Tordenskiold and started operating on the Larvik‚ÄìFrederikshavn route. The Peter Wessel collided with MS Sydfjord on 27 June 1986. the Sydfjord sunk following the collision, and 3 of her crew were evacuated on board the Peter Wessel, among the dead was the captain and his family. Peter Wessel was extended by meters at Blohm + Voss, Hamburg, Germany in 1988. Additional cabins were also built on the top of the ship. 1996‚Äì2008: Color Line MS Peter Wessel in Larvik In October 1996 Color Line chartered the Peter Wessel from Larvik Line, keeping her on the same route as before. In 1999 parts of the cardeck were built in with cabins, decreasing her car capacity. In spring 2003 the ship was rebuilt again, this time at Remontowa, Poland with large side sponsons for increased stabity. In 2004 Color Line bought the Peter Wessel from Larvik Line. In April 2006 the ship was transferred to the Larvik‚ÄîHirtshals route. On 22 March 2007 a fire broke out in one of the ship's electric switchboards, which forced her to sail to Frederikshavn. Due to repairs the ship was forced to stay out of service for over a month, returning to service on 26 April 2007. On 19 October 2007 Color Line reported that the Peter Wessel has been sold to Mediterranean Shipping Company, to be delivered after the delivery of the new in April‚ÄìMay 2008. Color Line press release 19. 10. 2007: Avtale om salg av M/S Peter Wessel, retrieved 21 November 2007. The Peter Wessel was delivered to her new owners on 16 April 2008 and subsequently renamed MS SNAV Toscana. 2008 onwards: SNAV-GNV SNAV Toscana in Genoa harbour in 2011 On 19 April 2008 the SNAV Toscana left Norway for the Mediterranean. She entered service on SNAV's Civitavecchia‚ÄîPalermo or Civitavecchia ‚Äì Olbia service during 2008. Now the ship services Genova ‚Äì Porto Torres route.

It is situated over an elongated plateau, called Santa √Ägueda, 264 m above sea level. It is the third highest point in the island behind Monte Toro (358 m) and S'Enclusa (275 m). The castle is accessed by an ancient Roman road. Next to the castle there was also, until recently, a chapel dedicated to Saint Agatha. History The Castle of Santa √Ägueda was built over an ancient Roman castra by the Arabs, when Man√ªrqa (Menorca) was part of the Caliphate of Cordoba. The exact date of its construction is not known, but it was prior to 1232. In 1287, it became the last standpoint of resistance by the Arab inhabitants when the island was invaded by King Alfonso III of Aragon. The castle was later destroyed by Alfonso's grand-nephew King Peter IV of Aragon around 1343. The Castle of Santa √Ägueda (2006) is in ruins. There is a project by the local insular government, Plan Especial de Protecci√≥n de Santa √Ägueda (PEP) (2004), to rehabilitate and refurbish Santa √Ägueda.

It is calculated by dividing nominal income by the price level. Real variables such as real income and real GDP are variables that are measured in physical units, while nominal variables such as nominal income and nominal GDP are measured in monetary units. Therefore, real income is a more useful indicator of well-being since it measures the amount of goods and services that can be purchased with the income. According to the classical dichotomy theory, real variables and nominal variables are separate in the long run, so they are not influenced by each other. In other words, if the nominal starting income was 100 and there was 10% inflation (general rise in prices, for example, what cost 10 now costs 11), then with nominal income of still 100, one can buy roughly 9% less; so if nominal income was not adjusted for inflation (did not rise by 10%), real income has dropped by approximately 9%. But if the classical dichotomy holds, nominal income will eventually go up by 10%, leaving real income unchanged from its original value.

The band formed around 2002. Career Similar in many respects to Jones' earlier work in Big Audio Dynamite, Carbon/Silicon aims to break the traditional approach to rock and roll. The band was described by critic Alan McGee as \\"...the Stones jamming with a laptop,\\" as they initially made extensive use of samples in their recordings and live shows but have given up that practice in recent years. The formation of the band was catalyzed by the internet and file sharing. The first song written by Jones and James was entitled \\"MPFree,\\" in which they expressed their willingness to embrace the technology of the internet and file sharing, in the interest of spreading music, rather than profit. The band still makes live bootlegs and recordings freely available through their own website, and the fansite. Carbon/Silicon recorded four demo CDs: Sample This, Peace; Dope Factory Boogie; The Grand Delusion and The Homecoming. The band's first officially released album, A.T.O.M (A Twist of Modern) debuted on the band's website on 28 July 2006. The next album Western Front followed soon after on 14 October 2006 and included re-recorded versions of their earlier songs. The group's third album, The Crackup Suite was released in March 2007. The same month it was announced that Leo \\"Eazykill\\" Williams, former bandmate of Jones with BAD would play bass for the group, and that Dominic Greensmith formerly of Reef would take up the drum slot. The band further released two EP's plus another album The Last Post and toured, including the Isle of Wight Festival and dates in the USA. In 2008, in collaboration with Callicore Studio, Carbon/Silicon released an animated video for \\"The News\\", a song from the album The Last Post. In January 2008, in what is seen as a return to their roots, the band played 7 weekly concerts at a tiny venue Inn on the Green in Ladbroke Grove, London. At the first gig, Topper Headon got up and played with the band for two songs. Jones' daughter, Lauren, sang with the band at Carbon Casino 3 and 4 in sets that were highlighted by Hitsville UK. At the final gig, Carbon Casino 7, the Alabama Three took to the stage with Jones and James to perform the theme from US TV series, The Sopranos. Throughout the run, support was provided by West London bands Taurus Trakker, The Rotten Hill Gang, and The Self, songwriter John Byrne, icons Pete Wylie, Glen Matlock, James Dean- Bradfield, John Cooper Clarke, and new young bands including West London's The Dirty Curtains, North London band The Usual Suspects and the Savage Nomads. In 2009 the band released The Carbon Bubble - their fourth full-length digital album release - free of charge at their official web site. 2010 has seen a further line-up change, with Jesse Wood replacing Leo Williams on bass, and the band has performed a number of festival dates at international venues, including the Neapolis festival (Naples) and Arthur's Day (Dublin). Later in 2010, their four free digital release albums were removed from their site and released commercially on iTunes and Amazon. The Crackup Suite was retitled The Crackup Suite Parts 1 and 2 and had six additional tracks added to it (four of which were previously unreleased) and Carbon Bubble had two previously unreleased tracks added to it. Since then, Carbon/Silicon has not been active besides a few scattered tours. In early 2013, they commercially released one additional song for download titled Big Surprise (with an accompanying video on YouTube) causing fans to briefly hope that more was to come, but it was only an outtake from their earlier recordings and it appears that nothing else is in the works at the moment.

Overview Founded in March 1999, the Miami Workers Center's mission is to work to end poverty and oppression. The center works on these issues by building the power of grassroots organizations made up of and led by the people most affected by these problems and by assisting in the development of a broad-based social justice movement in South Florida. The Center conducts its work by initiating and developing grassroots organizations; developing the strategic and technical capacity of leaders through the hands-on organizing and intensive political education; and increasing the voice, participation, and leadership of no- and low-wage workers (including the unemployed, welfare recipients, and service sector workers) and their organizations in local/national policy-making, community initiatives, and the broader social justice movement. Achievements The Center's most significant achievement has been the initiation and development of Low Income Families Fighting Together (LIFFT), which is a grassroots membership organization of and for current and former welfare recipients, low- wage workers, and public housing residents that has become a growing force in Miami-Dade County. In these efforts the Miami Workers' Center joins arms with South Florida's low-income people to address issues of poverty and oppression within the region's most oppressed communities.

It is a larger version of the tsuzumi, or kotsuzumi and is used in traditional Japanese theater and folk music. Its appearance is slightly different from that of the tsuzumi, and the sound produced is vastly different from any of the four sounds the kotsuzumi produces. Whereas the kotsuzumi is smaller and has a more ornate drum head, the ≈çkawa is larger, and its head takes on a more plain, leathery appearance. The sound is also higher and sharper in pitch, resembling more of a dry, almost metallic \\"crack\\" than the tsuzumi's softer \\"pon\\" sound. The hourglass structure is slightly bigger, and has a prominent protruding \\"knob\\" at the middle, unlike that of the kotsuzumi, which has a smoothened-out middle section. The heads of the drum are taut very tightly, leaving no room for further tension, and acoustic, adjustments. The ≈çkawa is played on the left thigh of the player, possibly due to its larger, heavy size, whereas the tsuzumi is played upon the right shoulder. The drum heads are made of thick, stiff horsehide taken from grown horses, and care for the drum heads of the ≈çkawa is peculiar in that they must be kept dry at all times. In contrast, the heads of the smaller kotsuzumi must always be moist. Since the sound of the ≈çkawa is supposed to be higher in pitch, the player must ensure that the skin of the drum-heads remains as constricted as possible, and this is best realized when the drum heads are kept dry. To keep the drum heads dry, they are often heated near a kind of old style of Japanese furnace called a hibachi no less than an hour before the performance. When ready to perform, the player takes the drumheads and binds them to the body of the ≈çkawa as tightly as possible using a thick, heavy duty hemp rope, and uses a type of thinner silk rope to further constrict the rope binding the drumheads and to provide grip for the player, before finishing the preparation by draping an ornamental hemp rope with long tassels onto the drum. Given the nature of the heads of the ≈çkawa, they wear after a specific number of times. Since they are very expensive, at least a thousand US dollars a pair, the ≈çkawa player must measure how many times, and how long, the instrument is played. If the heads are taken good care of, they can be used for as much as ten performances, after which the heads show signs of wear, lose their desired sound quality, and must be discarded. Like the tsuzumi, the ≈çkawa is also struck with a player's bare hands. As the drum heads are taut very tightly, it often hurts to play the drum, and calluses must be developed on the player's fingers to play comfortably. The calluses must be taken care of, being shaved with a knife from time to time before they get too big. Most players use deerhide padding on the palm of their hand, to protect their palm and enhance the sound. They also wear fingerstalls made of multiple layers of Japanese washi paper, hardened with starch, on their fingers.

The building was originally built for the Tao Nan School to serve the local Hokkien community, but the school has since been relocated to its current location in Marine Parade. The building was then used as a wing of the Asian Civilisations Museum, and now houses the Peranakan Museum. It was gazetted as a national monument on 27 February 1998. History Tao Nan School was set up by the Singapore Hokkien Association (Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan) on 18 November 1906 to provide modern education for Hokkien Chinese children. It was the first Chinese school in Singapore to adopt modern subjects in its syllabus such as such as geography, history and physical education, in addition to traditional Chinese subjects such as Confucian classics that would help promote and preserve Chinese culture and values. Although it was originally set up to serve the Hokkien community, it began to accept speakers of other Chinese languages in 1909, the first Chinese school to operate such inclusive policy. Lessons were initially conducted in Hokkien with some Mandarin classes, but English lessons were also introduced in 1914. In 1916, the school became the first Chinese school in Singapore switched its medium of education from Hokkien to Mandarin. The idea for the school was first mooted by Tan Boo Liat, and it gained the support of the Hokkien community. Funds for the school were raised, and the Siam House on North Bridge Road was chosen as the premise for the school. The Singapore Hokkien Association also provided an annual subsity for the school. The school was initially named Tao Nan Study Hall (ÈÅìÂçóÂ≠∏Â†Ç, Daonan Xuetang), the name Tao Nan being short for wu dao qi nan (ÂêæÈÅìÂÖ∂Âçó), meaning 'My code of behaviour is promulgated in Southeast Asia'. It had 90 students in its first year. As the number of pupils grew, Tan Kah Kee proposed that a new building be constructed, and $40,000 was raised by the Hokkien community for the building fund, to which Tan contributed $2,000. The sugar tycoon Majoor Oei Tiong Ham also gave $10,000 for the purchase of the land on Armenian Street on which Tao Nan School was built. Construction began 1910, and the school relocated to the new school building when it was completed in 1912. The school was then renamed Tao Nan School (Daonan Xuexiao). Tan Kah Kee served for 12 years as the school's president. When the school switched to Mandarin as the medium of instruction, the Mandarin syllabus was implemented by its first non-Hokkien principal, Xiong Shangfu, a native of Hunan province. The school was closed during the Japanese Occupation from 1942 to 1945 when the Japanese took over the school and said to have used it as a military headquarters. After the war, the student population increased rapidly and classes were held in two separate sessions. In 1958, the school then became a government-aided school and also began to emphasize Malay, Chinese, Tamil and English languages in its syllabus in the 1950s and 60s. However, the school's population had declined by the mid-1970s as families moved out of the city center to the newly established housing estates in the suburbs, and in 1976, it was decided that the school should be re-located to Marine Parade to cater for the suburban population there. In 1982, Tao Nan School moved to its new campus in Marine Parade, where it remains today. Also in 1982, English became its main medium of instruction. Throughout its history, the school has produced many prominent Chinese leaders among its alumni, among them Lee Kong Chian. The school was refurbished and became a wing of the Asian Civilisations Museum in 1994, and was officially opened on 21 April 1997. The Old Tao Nan School building was gazetted as a national monument on 27 February 1998. When the Asian Civilisations Museum was established in Empress Place Building in 2006 after its renovation, the Old Tao Nan School was repurposed as the Peranakan Museum which opened on 25 April 2008. Architecture Sculpture exhibit at the Peranakan Museum The Old Tao Nan School building was designed by the Municipal Engineer's Office of Singapore in an eclectic classical style with elements of the French Renaissance. The front facade features Corinthian fluted pilasters, with large wide verandahs designed to accommodate the tropical climate of Singapore. It also has large windows and high ceilings for better ventilation in a hot climate. A pair of black cast-iron eagles, said to ward off evil, guard the entrance to the school. The building is three-storey high, with a square central atrium topped with a skylight. The classrooms, now converted into galleries, were located on all three floors, and can be accessed via symmetrical staircases on either side of the atrium leading up to the corridors on the upper floors. Peranakan Museum Today, the Old Tao Nan School building houses the Peranakan Museum which was opened in April 2008 by Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. The Museum explores the main themes of Peranakan life in ten permanent galleries. Displays include the twelve-day Peranakan wedding and the role of the Nyonyas (female Peranakans).

Demographics Inhabitants of Noisiel are called Noisi√©liens. In 2014, Noisiel had 15,523 inhabitants, a rise of 0.07% since 2009 (Seine-et-Marne : 4,68 % , France without Mayotte : 2,49 %). The evolution of the number of inhabitants is known through the population censuses carried out in the town since 1793. From the 21st century, the census for communes with more than 10,000 inhabitants takes place every year as a result of a sample survey, unlike the other communes which have a real census every five years. As of 1998, 8% of the population was Asian and certain parts of the commune had high Asian populations.Guillon, Michelle. \\"The Chinese and Chinese Districts in Paris\\" (Chapter 11).

The system was built in phases by the Hong Kong Government and various developers, such as Hongkong Land, Jardine Matheson Holdings and Shun Tak Holdings. It has escalators and staircases for access. Parts of it are air-conditioned. There is another system in Admiralty that is currently not connected to the Central system. History In the 1970s, Hongkong Land built a footbridge over Connaught Road to facilitate pedestrian access between Connaught Place (today's Jardine House), Swire House (today's Chater House) and the General Post Office. The developer also built many footbridges between its buildings which were under construction. In the 1980s, after Exchange Square was completed, the government built a footbridge to connect to Hongkong Land's network; it ran west along the harbourfront to connect Central Piers and Shun Tak Centre. Other buildings along Queen's Road Central, such as Standard Chartered Bank Building and Central Tower, were also connected to the system. In 1993, the Central‚ÄìMid-Levels escalator came into operation, and Hang Seng Bank Building was connected. In 1998, the International Finance Centre and Airport Express Hong Kong Station were completed and brought into the network. After 2000, the government built a bridge between World-Wide House and Exchange Square.

Princeton University Press, 1968 (p. 459-461). and was a founder of the New York Bible Society and the New York Tract Society.  Life and career  David Low Dodge was born in Brooklyn, Connecticut on June 14, 1774.The Dodge Family Association: \\"David Low Dodge, Jr.\\" retrieved January 19, 2013 His parents were David Dodge and Mary (Stuart) Earl. She was said to have been the daughter of a Scottish nobleman, perhaps connected with the House of Stuart, pretenders to the British throne, although this has never been confirmed. She had previously been married to William Earl who died of yellow fever fighting for the British during an attack on Havana in 1762. During the War of Independence, Mary's two children from this first marriage, William and Jesse Earl, were both killed on active service. Dodge later wrote that \\"these events almost destroyed my mother's nervous system.\\" From the age of seven to fourteen, except two months of district school in winter, Dodge was working on a farm in Hampton, Connecticut. He was a teacher at the age of nineteen, first in community schools then in private ones. He later began selling dry goods in Hartford, Connecticut. He also managed the first cotton factory built in Connecticut, near the town of Norwich. In the early 19th century he relocated to New York City. On June 7, 1798, he married Sarah Cleveland (1780‚Äì1862), the daughter of Rev. Aaron Cleveland (1744‚Äì1815) and Abiah Hyde (c1750‚Äì1788).The Descendants of John Porter of Windsor, Conn. 1635-9, Volume 1 retrieved January 19, 2013Aaron Cleveland was the son of Aaron Cleveland who was also a clergyman. In David Low Dodge's autobiography, Memorial of Mr. David L. Dodge, consisting of an autobiography, prepared at the request and for the use of his children; with a few selections from his writings, published 1854, pages 53-54, he writes that Sarah's father was a hatter from Hadden Connecticut, born 1744. He entered the ministry late in life holding office in Orange County, Vermont. They had seven children including William E. Dodge and Elizabeth Clementine Stedman. He was also the great-grandfather of Grace Hoadley Dodge. Sarah Cleveland was great-aunt of Grover Cleveland 22nd and 24th President of the United States. David Low Dodge is credited with publishing the first pamphlets in America that expressed the futility of war. The Mediator's Kingdom not of this World, was published in 1809, his second, War Inconsistent with the Religion of Jesus Christ, was completed in 1812, two years before the publication of Noah Worcester's Solemn Review of the Custom of War - a work that has since overshadowed Dodge's contribution. Dodge considered forming the first peace society in 1812, but the timing was inappropriate due to the war with Great Britain. However, in August 1815 the New York Peace Society was formed with Dodge as the president. This was the first in the world - four months before Noah Worcester formed the Massachusetts Peace Society, and a year before the English Peace society was formed. In 1829 he assisted in organizing the new national society, and presided at its first annual meeting. He was a member of the board of directors, and later a life director, maintaining his connection with the society until his death. He died on April 23, 1852 in New York City.

GeographicSiyar-ul-Mutakherin It roughly corresponds to the ancient Urasa, the AœÅœÉa or ŒüŒ∞aœÅœÉa which Ptolemy placed between the Bidaspes (Jhelum) and the Indus.Pakhli - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 19, p. 318 It was part of the Gandhara or Gandharva country of antiquity). It later became part of Chandragupta Maurya's Empire. The archaeological remains found here suggest that this was a place of great Buddhist learning. In the Rajatarangini this place now appeared as a separate kingdom and then again as tributary to the Kashmir valley. The Ain-i-Akbari refers to this entire region as Sarkar Pakhli, which formed a part of the larger Kashmir province, which in turn was part of Subah Kabul.Abu'l-Fazl, 16-17th century. tr. H.S. Jarrett, v 2, p 397 (1891) The area of Pakhli today forms a part of the Mansehra of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. History The king of Pakhli at the time of Alexander the Great was Arsakes, during the time of the Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang visited the area it was a tributary of Kashmir. The area was named after Sultan Pakhal the elder brother of Sultan Behram who conquered all the area from Jalalabad to Kashmir from Hindus. His rule didn't last long as he died very young.An Account of the Kingdom of Caubul by Mountstuart Elphinstone.Notes on Afghanistan and Baluchistan by Maj. Raverty Tazkira tul Abrar wa Ashrar by Akhun Darweza According to the Kashmir Chronicle Rajatarangini, the area was now a separate kingdom and a tributary to the Kashmir state. In it lay Agror, the ancient Atyugrapura. In Babar's time this tract was held by the Khakha and Bambha tribes, whose chiefs had been the ancient rulers of the country east of the Indus, but had been driven out by the Gabri Sultans of Bajaur and Swat; and the tract derives its name from Pakhli, one of these conquerors.Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 19, p. 319 In the Ain-i-Akbari it is described as bounded on the east by Kashmir, on the south by the country of the Gakhars, on the west by Attock, and on the north by Kator (Chitral). Under Durrani rule Saadat Khan was chosen as chief of Pakhli, then a dependency of Kashmir. He founded the fort of Garhi Saadat Khan, which was the headquarters of Azad Khan's rebellion against Timur Shah. Its main city was once Agror, the ancient Atyugrapura. In Babur's time this tract was held by the Khakha and Bambha tribes, whose chiefs had been the ancient rulers of the country east of the Indus but had been driven out by the Gabri Sultans of Bajawar and Swat. Tajik Swati Gabr by Prof. Akhtar Early in the nineteenth century Pakhli comprised three districts: Mansehra in the south and south-east, Shinkiari (subdivided into Kandhi and Maidan) in the north-east, and Bhir-Kand in the centre. The valleys of Kagan, Bhogarmang, and Agror were dependent on it. Mughal Era Pakhli Sarkar was the only state in Mughal Empire which was exempted from any tax payments to Delhi. \\"Tareekh-i-Hazara by Panni\\" During Akbar's era, Sultan Hussain Khan of Pakhli revolted against him on the basis that the Delhi Sultanate was interfering into Pakhli's internal affairs. Akbar defeated him, but restored him in his position later on. Decline and fall of Karlugh Turks and arrival of Swatis During the entire period of Mughal ascendancy in Indian sub-continent, Mughals acknowledged Karlughs as the rulers of Cis Indus Pakhli Sarkar. Sultan Maqarrab revolted against his own brother Sultan Mehmud Khurd, but was defeated by the Sultan due to intervention from the Delhi Sultanate Karlugh Turks had by that time had weakened enough to be overthrown by Swatis who established their rule in the plains of Pakhli and mountains of Kaghan valley\\"Hazara Gazetteer,1883\\" These areas were then divided between Swati and Syeds. The region of Mansehra that previousl[y belonged to the Sum Elai-Mang was handed over to the Swati Khankhails The Kaghan valley was given to the Syeds and Oghi was delivered to Ali Sheris Bala souri Khankhails and different Swati clans \\"Settlement Report 1872 by Capt.

Sultan Qyas-ud-din, younger brother of Sultan Mehmud, was the Waali (Governor) of what is now Tanawal. In Tanawal areas, Karlugh Turks retained their power for another 90 yearsHazara Gazetteer,1907 But were restricted to a small area of lower Tanawal from Sherwan (Abbottabad) to Behali (Mansehra). The Sikhs In the early nineteenth century, Pakhli formed part of the Kingdom of Kabul (modern day Afghanistan) and through it ran the high road connecting Kabul to Kashmir. In 1813, the Afghans lost the strategically placed Fort of Attock (on the left bank of the Indus) to the Sikhs under Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The tribute due from the lower regions of Pakhli, formerly collected by the Afghan Governor of Attock, now became due to the Sikhs. In 1819, when the Sikhs wrested Kashmir from the Afghans, the tribute due from the upper reaches of Pakhli also became due to them. Numerous attempts to collect tribute from the lower parts of Hazara not only met with failure, but also the loss of prominent Sikh administrators and commanders.Nalwa, V. 2009. Hari Singh Nalwa - Champion of the Khalsaji, New Delhi: Manohar, pp. 78-9 In 1822, Maharaja Ranjit Singh granted both Pakhli and Damtaur as a jagir to Hari Singh Nalwa as a reward for his remarkable success in the Kashmir mountains.Latif, S.M. (1891) 1967. History of the Punjab - From the remotest antiquity to the present time, rpt, New Delhi: Kalyani Publishers, p. 427 As soon as Hari Singh received Pakhli and Damtaur in jagir, he built the famous town of Haripur in the heart of the plains of Hazara.Hazara Gazetteer 1907,p. 233 This fortified township has grown over the last 175 years into the Haripur District (Pakistan). The ruins of several forts built by this indomitable Sikh general continue to dot the landscape of Pakhli, which continued as Hari Singh Nalwa's jagir till his death in 1837. It was after him that this entire region came to be known as Hazara. Descendants Descendants of the Karlugh Turks still live in Behali Mansehra, Rich Behn Abbottabad, Manakrai, Bayan Ahmed Ali Khan, Pharhari and Nartopa villages of Haripur and Azad Kashmir (Shawai, Chanjal, Ghari Dupata, Balgraan) and Descendants of Sultan Behram and Sultan Pakhal are still living in Hazara known as Swatis of Hazara.\\"Tareekh-i-Hazara Panni\\"  References  Category:Mansehra District ","title":"Pakhli"},{"id":"3785448","text":"John Peter Sophocleus is an American economist and libertarian political activist.

Originally broadcasting at 1220 kHz AM, later on 1300 kHz, for many years on 1330 kHz and finally on 1050 kHz, operation of the station was taken over by the publishing association responsible for producing the Yiddish-language social democratic daily newspaper The Jewish Daily Forward in 1932. An FM station using the same call sign was added during the 1950s. After briefly leaving AM broadcasting in 1979, The Forward swapped its FM frequency for another AM frequency and continued broadcasting as a small ethnic station until divesting itself late in the 1980s. History=Origins Norman Thomas, who would run 6 times for President heading the Socialist ticket, was Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Debs Memorial Radio Fund. Radio broadcasting emerged on a mass scale in the United States during the first half of the 1920s, with the number of stations in operation rising from 28 in 1921 to 571 in 1925.Nathan Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure: The Socialists and American Broadcasting, 1926-1932,\\" in Ronald C. Kent et al. (eds.), Culture, Gender, Race, and U.S. Labor History. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1993; pg. 124. A new form of mass media had emerged. Congress passed federal legislation called the Radio Act of 1927 early in that year establishing a Federal Radio Commission (FRC), which was granted power to regulate the emerging industry, granting licenses and assigning broadcasting wavelengths to bring order to a chaotic market. Under this legislation, broadcasters would not own the right to broadcast at a certain frequency but would rather use what was deemed a public resource for a limited period of time, not to exceed three years. To earn continuation of the privilege of broadcasting over the public airwaves, stations would be forced to demonstrate service to the public interest under the new law. The Socialist Party of America was in the throes of a membership decline throughout the decade of the 1920s, the communist left wing of the organization having been suspended, expelled or split from the organization beginning with the seminal 1919 Emergency National Convention of the party.Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 126. Dues-paying membership fell during this period from more than 100,000 to less than 10,000. The party's finances were similarly deeply affected and the organization felt pressed to explore new means of reaching an increasingly apathetic public. At its December 1926 quarterly meeting the governing National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party decided to erect a radio broadcasting station as a memorial to its recently deceased co-founder, Eugene V. Debs, who had died in October of the previous year.Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 127. In March 1927 the Socialist Party of America launched a fundraising drive aimed at generating $250,000 for the purchase of an AM radio station.\\"Drive Opens to Build Debs Radio,\\" The New Leader, vol. 3, no. 11 (March 12, 1927), pp. 1, 3. Party leader and head of the League for Industrial Democracy Norman Thomas was chosen as chairman of the Board of Trustees for the new enterprise and venerated party founder Morris Hillquit was appointed as treasurer. A total of 21 others from the liberal, labor and socialist community were appointed as a Board of Trustees including such publicly recognized figures as pacifist minister - John Haynes Holmes, Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters founder A. Philip Randolph, Amalgamated Clothing Workers leader Sidney Hillman, novelist Upton Sinclair and American Civil Liberties Union head Roger Baldwin. G. August Gerber, son of New York Socialist Party functionary Julius Gerber, was named as secretary of the Board and director of the fundraising drive. At the time of the fundraising drive's launch Norman Thomas remarked: > The usefulness of a well established radio station open to full and frank > discussion of great economic and social issues is beyond doubt. Past > experience combines with common sense in assuring us that the commercial > broadcasting stations cannot be expected to give much time or attention to > the great vision for which Gene Debs gave his life. I am glad to observe > that you have invited and obtained the acceptance of men and women as > trustees who are not members of the Socialist Party. Such ... [shall] > guarantee that the Debs Memorial Radio Fund will be free from a narrow and > intolerant partisanship. Thomas and Hillquit were explicit in their desire to make the radio station a memorial to the departed Debs. In a joint statement they called for a \\"monument\\" which was to be \\"a living instrument of social service ... to be operated in the interests of all progressive movements and ideas and in aid of all struggles for social justice in the tolerant and broad-minded spirit of Gene Debs.\\" The Debs Memorial Radio Fund launched its fundraising campaign with a mailing of 15,000 letters soliciting funds for the establishment of a Socialist Party-owned radio station.Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 128. This first round of solicitation brought in just over $2650 ‚Äî barely more than 1% of the declared goal $250,000 sought for the project. The Radio Fund's trustees estimated cost of launching a station at $100,000 and hoped to invest the balance to generate sufficient interest income to allow for perpetual operations. While this grand vision of substantial funding proved overly optimistic, the necessary funds for the acquisition of a station were successfully raised from party members and sympathetic labor unions during the first half of 1927. Launch Around the first of August 1927 the trustees of the \\"Debs Memorial Radio Fund\\" announced the purchase of AM radio station WSOM, transmitting from Woodhaven in the New York City borough of Queens.\\"Debs Fund Buys Radio Station: Broadcasting is to Begin Soon: Socialist, Labor and Liberal Group is Now Owner of WSOM,\\" The New Leader, vol. 4, no. 7 (Aug. 6, 1927), pg. 3. WSOM had been on the air since 1926, broadcasting initially at 1040 and 1220 kHz; the station had moved into New York just six months prior. Immediate application was to be made to the Federal Radio Commission for a change of call letters to WDEBS, it was reported, as well as for an increase of transmission power from 500 to 1,000 watts to enable the station to broadcast with less interference from the skyscrapers of New York. The broadcast studio was to be located somewhere in Manhattan, it was reported. The Socialist Party and its partners had entered into the acquisition of the existing station, formerly owned by Union Course Laboratories of Woodhaven, after having received assurances from the Federal Radio Commission that a broadcasting license would be promptly granted upon purchase. Joining the Socialist Party with the Debs radio project were a number of national and international trade unions, including the United Mine Workers of America, the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union, the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, and the United Hebrew Trades. Also joining the fundraising effort were the left wing fraternal benefit society the Workmen's Circle and the financially successful Yiddish language social democratic daily, The Jewish Daily Forward, headed by Abraham Cahan. While the purchase price of the station was not revealed in the press, August Gerber indicated that the bulk of the $250,000 operating fund ‚Äî which had still not been fully met ‚Äî was to be used to cover ongoing operating expenses. Gerber expressed a belief that the station would become self- supporting in fairly short order and indicated a desire to make the new New York station the flagship of a network of \\"labor radio stations\\" throughout the United States. At the time of the station's purchase, Gerber declared: The party's plan for the use of call letters WDEBS was short-circuited by the FRC, which ruled that only aircraft could use five-letter call names and that ground radio station was limited to four letters or fewer. Eugene V. Debs' initials were thus substituted, and WEVD was born. The Debs Memorial Radio Fund began operating WEVD on August 18, 1927. Broadcasting was not limited to the English language, however. One of the organizations behind the funding of the WEVD project, the widely circulated and financially successful Jewish Daily Forward, launched what would become what one radio historian has called \\"the most famous Yiddish radio program of all time\\" ‚Äî The Forward Hour.\\"The Yiddish Radio Dial,\\" Sound Portraits Productions, 2002, yiddishradioproject.org/ The show was first broadcast every Sunday morning at 11 am and gained a significant following among the Yiddish-speaking immigrant community of New York City. Finances were tight throughout the entire period of the Socialist Party's operation of the station.Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 129. Operating costs were minimized through the generosity of the ILGWU, which allowed the station free use of the entire 6th floor of its headquarters building in New York City. A network of studios and reception rooms were created in the space, providing a fully adequate base of operations for the station. Operating funding came from small-scale listener contributions, regular donations from the American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations interested in the station's mission, and the left wing philanthropic trust, the American Fund for Public Service, commonly known as the Garland Fund. Station manager August Gerber dedicated much of his time to keeping the station's meager revenue stream flowing, although already by January 1928 Norman Thomas was opining that the Socialist Party and its radio station \\"can't go on living like this.\\"Norman Thomas to G. August Gerber, January 4, 1928. Norman Thomas Papers 1904-1967, Microfilm Edition, Reel 1. Quoted in Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 129. Regulatory difficulties On top of the Socialist Party's financial troubles came regulatory problems with the FRC, which on May 25, 1928 demanded that WEVD and 163 other stations show cause why their broadcasting licenses should not be revoked as part of a plan to rationalize the distribution of radio bandwidth by forcing out small stations catering to niche audiences in favor of fewer high powered stations broadcasting commercially to a mass market. Representatives of WEVD and 109 other threatened stations made their way to Washington, D.C. in July 1928 for two weeks of regulatory hearings on the issue. Station manager Gerber responded with a statement emphasizing the importance of defending free speech and the right of political minorities to submit their ideas to a broad public.Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 130. Party leader Norman Thomas echoed this perspective, declaring the value of WEVD and other community stations as a bulwark against a \\"big chain system\\" which tended to \\"standardize ‚Äî to make robots and Babbitts of the American people.\\"Quoted in Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 131. The efforts of Gerber and Thomas ultimately proved successful, with the FRC approving the WEVD renewal application one month later.Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 131. In the FRC's judgment WEVD had followed a \\"very satisfactory policy\\" of representing a range of political and economic perspectives befitting \\"the mouthpiece of a substantial political or religious minority.\\" An editor at the New York Times concurred with the radio regulators' assessment, noting that revoking WEVD's license on the basis of its political views \\"would be both unjust and stupid.\\"New York Times, August 23, 1928, pg. 20. Quoted in Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 131. WEVD won praise for its news reporting and commentary, taking an array of issues relating to world affairs, American foreign policy, and activities of the American labor movement.Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 132. In an era in which few stations did likewise, WEVD did not fail to produce programming dealing with African-American history and culture, including the broadcast of a weekly Pullman Porters Hour sponsored by the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters which included both entertainment and talks on serious topics of interest to the black community of New York City. WEVD's Educational Director, Paul Blanshard, expanded the station's educational content following its August 1928 license renewal, including weekly courses on economics conducted by A.J. Muste of Brookwood Labor College. Sunday afternoons the station broadcast a regular speakers' forum which included such prominent liberal voices as journalist Walter Lippman, Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, and Oswald Garrison Villard, publisher of The Nation magazine. Frequency change and more trouble Socialist Party leader Morris Hillquit, an attorney, was instrumental in the 1928 and 1931 regulatory defenses of WEVD. Late in 1928, by General Order 40, WEVD was moved to a new frequency by the Federal Radio Commission, 1300 AM, and was able to boost its power somewhat.Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 135. While the move had been sought by the Debs Memorial Radio Fund, which remained the legal entity owning the station, the change ultimately solved little ‚Äî WEVD remained underpowered and forced to share its frequency with three other stations. The station broadcast 50 hours per week, ranging from as little as two hours on Fridays to 18 hours on Wednesdays. WEVD found itself in a difficult financial position that was a veritable catch-22 ‚Äî unions and other left wing institutions were difficult to motivate to make donations due to the station's limited broadcast time and poor signal coverage, but without these donations it would be impossible to improve the transmission situation which would make the donations happen. To make up the financial shortfall the station became aggressive in pushing for contributions from its listeners. The FRC continued to seek a reduction in the number of stations to more closely match the limited number of broadcast frequencies and saw weak and underfinanced stations such as WEVD as fodder for the executioner's axe. A number of complaints about the station began to be accumulated. In October 1930 a new set of hearings began with respect to the license renewal of the socialist radio station. A range of violations of the Radio Act of 1927 were cited, including repeated failure to announce station call letters on the air every 15 minutes and inability to stay on its assigned wavelength. A recommendation was made by the FRC examiner assigned to the case to deny the station's license renewal application.Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 136. Once again Norman Thomas, August Gerber, and Morris Hillquit jumped to action, painting the station's woes as part of a political vendetta aimed at homogenization of the radio airwaves at the expense of political minorities. The American Civil Liberties Union promised its aid in making the WEVD renewal controversy a national free speech campaign. The final report of the FRC examiner was filed on December 11, 1930 and the station was notified of the decision a week later. Within two weeks the station had submitted a 17-page challenge of the FRC examiner's ruling, which combined with public pressure from listeners compelled the FRC to temporarily reverse its decision on January 13, 1931. Additional regulatory hearings about WEVD were held in March and May 1931, with regulators charging that the Debs Memorial Radio Fund lacked sufficient financial resources to meet minimum standards established by the FRC.Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pp. 136-137. The uniqueness of WEVD's broadcast content was also denied.Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 137. Regulators thus sought to award the WEVD frequency to station WFOX, owned by Paramount Pictures, arguing that station's \\"superior fitness to serve the public convenience, necessity and welfare.\\" In response to the FRC's hostile action, efforts were made to address the situation at WEVD through a fundamental reorganization of the operation. Problems to be addressed included inadequate equipment, poor broadcast location, insufficient funding, and a haphazard planning of station content. Party leader Morris Hillquit was particularly instrumental in the reorganization, coming up with the idea of selling $50,000 in WEVD stock in order to pay off standing obligations and invest in new capacity and content.Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 138. The need to raise funds to improve and expand operations during the second half of 1931 was answered by Abe Cahan, editor and publisher of the social democratic Jewish Daily Forward, the largest Yiddish-language newspaper in the world. Cahan was firmly committed to the importance of the project and he made the newspapers funds freely available, depositing $70,000 on account in the fall of 1931 for the expansion of the station assuming the renewal of its broadcast license.Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 139. Together with previous and subsequent cash infusions, the Forward had invested $200,000 in WEVD by the end of that year. In a split decision the FRC renewed the license for WEVD at the end of October 1931. Preparations immediately began for the transfer of the station's operations from the 6th floor of the ILGWU building in Manhattan to a new home located on Long Island, and the station's management was shuffled. The grand opening of the new studio took place on September 28, 1932, and was marked by an array of liberal and socialist worthies who spoke at the occasion, including Hillquit, Cahan, educator John Dewey, magazine publisher Oswald Garrison Villard, and writer Heywood Broun.Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pp. 139-140. Transfer to The Forward Abraham Cahan (1860-1951) of the Jewish Daily Forward in his later years. In 1938, WEVD bought one of its time-sharing partners on 1330, WHAP/WFAB; an FCC examiner recommended the Debs Memorial Fund be allowed to buy the WFAB assets for $85,000 from the Fifth Avenue Broadcasting Corporation, expanding its weekly broadcast hours from 50 to 86. However, two other stations shared the broadcast frequency with WEVD: WHAZ, the radio station of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, which was on-air only on Monday evenings, and WBBR, also of New York, New York, owned by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, publishing arm of the religious group Jehovah's Witnesses. From the time of the 1932 broadcasting agreement through the 1970s the Socialist and Yiddish-language WEVD continued to share its station frequency with the religious group, transmitting 86 hours per week while leaving Sundays and early mornings until 8 am to WBBR (sold and changed to WPOW in 1957), and Monday nights to WHAZ. WHAZ was sold to the owners of WPOW in 1967 and turned into a non-interfering, daytime-only station, with WPOW taking the old WHAZ Monday night hours. All of these stations moved from 1300 to 1330 kHz with the coming into force of the North American Radio Broadcasting Agreement on March 29, 1941. It is said that \\"he who pays the piper calls the tune,\\" and it was clear by 1932 from whence came the funding of \\"Debs radio.\\"Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 140. The Jewish Daily Forward's investment in the station soon swelled to nearly $250,000 and its influence over programming increased commensurately. Throughout the 1930s the station's editorial line moved steadily away from explicitly socialist politics to a more centrist orientation, paralleling the political perspective of The Forward itself. The Forward also underwrote the 1938 purchase of WFAB. Free access to the airwaves by trade unions was increasingly restricted and left wing political broadcasting sometimes faced preemption in favor of sponsored commercial content. The station ultimately emerged as the radio arm of The Forward, while the Socialist Party turned to the airwaves of the National Broadcast Company and other channels in its efforts to make its political message heard on a mass basis.Godfried, \\"Legitimizing the Mass Media Structure,\\" pg. 142. WEVD did not become completely apolitical in this period, however, as during the 1930s a weekly talk show was launched hosted by Chester M. Wright of the International Labor News Service.Nathan Godfried, WCFL: Chicago's Voice of Labor, 1926-78. Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1997; pg. 198. This show paid its way through a commercial sponsorship by Avalon Cigarettes and was syndicated to a national audience through electrical transcription. On January 9, 1950, Harold Cammer, Burton Zorn, Edwin M. Ottenbourg, Samuel Harris Cohen spoke with Stanley G. House as moderator on \\"Should New York State Have a Little Taft- Hartley Law?\\" In 1951, a WEVD-FM was added to the airwaves, first broadcasting at 107.5, then moving to 97.9 a year later, where it remained for the next 36 years. On February 6, 1953, New York University philosophy professor Sidney Hook discussed \\"The Threat to Academic Freedom\\" with Victor Riesel and others in the evening on WEVD radio. In 1975, WEVD was approved to begin using the transmitting facilities of its shared-time partner, WPOW, on Rossville, Staten Island. Sale and transformation By 1978, the Forward was analyzing the sale of the unprofitable AM outlet. In 1981, the Forward Association sold WEVD AM to Salem Media, which changed the station's format and call letters, making it the Christian station WNYM. Salem subsequently purchased WPOW, merging that station into WNYM and eliminating the 52-year time-share on 1330 as of December 31, 1984. WEVD-FM remained on the air under The Forward's ownership at this time. WNYM evolved into the present WWRV, now broadcasting around the clock on 1330 AM. In 1988, Emmis Broadcasting acquired the license of WNBC and moved WFAN from 1050 to 660 AM. Emmis sold the license for 1050 to Spanish Broadcasting System (SBS), which quickly agreed to trade that license with cash to the Forward Association for WEVD-FM. Until the latter transaction was approved, SBS operated 1050 as a Spanish-language station called WUKQ. When the deal was finally consummated, WEVD moved its call letters and programming to 1050 and the former WEVD-FM became WSKQ-FM. WEVD gradually replaced much of its brokered ethnic programming with liberal talk shows over the next several years; it gained some loyal listeners, but not enough to keep the station economically viable. In 2001, the Forward Association entered into a local marketing agreement with ESPN Radio, and WEVD began broadcasting that network's programming on September 2 of that year. In 2003, the station was sold outright to ESPN and its call letters changed to WEPN, officially ending the 76-year history of WEVD in New York City.

All ATM cards issued by Dutch banks had smart cards that could be loaded with value via Chipknip loading stations next to ATMs. For people who did not have Dutch bank accounts, pre-paid Chipknip cards could be purchased at various locations in the Netherlands. Chipknip was used for payments at parking machines, office canteens, and for other small retail transactions. No network access was required by the payment collection terminal. The system was complementary to the online electronic point-of-sale payment system known in the Netherlands as PIN which transfers money between bank accounts in real-time. The maximum value of Chipknip storage and transactions was quite limited but adequate for small retail transactions. Chipknip was introduced in 1996, based on technology used in the Belgian Proton electronic cash system. The value stored on the card does not need a PIN to unlock it: the card is entered into the reader at the point of payment, and the cardholder simply confirms the transfer of value. Chipknip is owned by the Dutch organization Currence, which also owns PIN and iDEAL. Statistics issued at the beginning of 2007 indicated that Chipknip grew by 12% in 2006 over 2005 and was used for 165 million transactions. The average transaction value was ‚Ç¨2.68.

It is typically a long, sand- or gravel-filled lane connected to a steep downhill grade section of a main road, and is designed to accommodate large trucks or buses. The ramp allows a moving vehicle's kinetic energy to be dissipated gradually in a controlled and relatively harmless way, helping the operator to stop it safely without a violent crash. Design Emergency escape ramps are usually located in mountainous areas which cause high construction costs and present difficult site selection. A ramp may cost US $1 million. Designs include: *Arrester bed: a gravel-filled ramp adjacent to the road that uses rolling resistance to stop the vehicle. The required length of the bed depends on the mass and speed of the vehicle, the grade of the arrester bed, and the rolling resistance provided by the gravel. *Gravity escape ramp: a long, upwardly inclined path parallel to the road. Substantial length is required. Control can be difficult for the driver; problems include rollback after the vehicle stops. *Sand pile escape ramp: a short length of loosely piled sand. Problems include sudden, forceful deceleration; sand being affected by weather conditions (moisture and freezing); and vehicles vaulting and/or overturning after contacting the sand pile. *Mechanical-arrestor escape ramp: a proprietary system of stainless- steel nets transversely spanning a paved ramp to engage and retard a runaway vehicle. Ramps of this type are typically shorter than gravity ramps, and can work even on a downhill grade. These systems tend to be costly, but may save expensive real estate in crowded areas, and prevent even more costly crashes. One such ramp at Avon, Connecticut in the United States has an electrically heated pavement surface to prevent snow and ice accumulation.http://www.4ishgd.valencia.upv.es/index_archivos/81.pdf *Alternatives: such as a vehicle arresting barrier. Location Emergency escape ramps are usually located on steep, sustained grades, as in mountainous areas. Long descending grades can allow high vehicle speeds to be reached, and truck brakes can overheat and fail through extensive use. The ramps are often built before a critical change in the radius of curvature of the road, or before a place that may require the vehicle to stop, such as before an intersection in a populated area. The placement criteria can vary from one region/country to another.

He was also an Italian junior gymnast, but achieved more gymnastics success in a non-performing capacity, rising to become president of the FIG. Biography A native of Forl√¨, Emilia Romagna, Grandi served as Professor of Physical education at the High Institute of Physical Education in Rome. He was a member of the Italian Artistic Gymnastic Juniors team, national coach of the Italian Men's junior's team and the long-time President of the Italian Gymnastics Federation (1977-2000). He pioneered the use of the 6-3-3 system in team finals which is intended to expand the number of countries who can win medals by making it possible to succeed with a smaller pool of gymnasts. Perhaps as a consequence of this, more nations have achieved gymnastics success during his tenure than did before. They tend to win medals in individual finals rather than team events (in women's gymnastics, only twice in the past 15 years has a world team medal been won by any nation other than Romania, Russia, China and the USA, and never an Olympic team medal). In comparison, since 2000 the sport has seen female world and Olympic individual champions from the likes of France, Spain, Brazil, Italy, Great Britain, Australia, North Korea, and the Netherlands. So at present, it would seem that the diversity in medal winning nations does not stretch across the whole sport, the team event still tending to remain the preserve of the sports traditional powers. During Grandi's tenure, the sport has gone through many controversies, notably those at the 2004 Olympics. The men's high bar fiasco surrounding Alexei Nemov and the Paul Hamm / Yang Tae Young dispute garnered the most publicity. In 2004-2005, the FIG and its president Grandi developed a new scoring system, in which an open- ended scoring will be used, so that the marks are theoretically limitless, therefore eliminating the notion of Perfect 10. The majority of the FIG did vote in favour of the new Code. This was a controversial move: many fans and athletes alike campaigned against it, speaking out in opposition. The new code took effect in 2006. In 2001 Grandi was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame. He died in Italy after an illness at age 85.

PA 724 travels through the counties of Berks and Chester. The route runs through the southern suburbs of Reading, passing through Shillington and Kenhorst. Past the Reading area, PA 724 continues southeast parallel to the Schuylkill River, passing through or near Birdsboro, Pottstown, and Spring City. The route intersects many roads including US 222 near Shillington, PA 10 and Interstate 176 (I-176) southeast of Reading, PA 345 in Birdsboro, and PA 100 and US 422 near Pottstown. The portion of PA 724 between Poplar Neck Road southeast of Reading and PA 23 was designated as part of PA 83 in 1927. By 1966, PA 724 was assigned to its current alignment and replaced the portion of PA 83 between the Reading area and Phoenixville. PA 724 was referenced in Hall & Oates' 1973 album Abandoned Luncheonette, with the defunct Rosedale Diner that was located along the route near Pottstown on the album cover. Route description PA 724 eastbound approaching split with US 222 Bus. in Shillington PA 724 begins at an intersection with US 422 near the city of Reading in the borough of Sinking Spring, Berks County, heading southeast on two-lane undivided Shillington Road. The road passes businesses and crosses under Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line. The route gains a center left-turn lane and crosses into Spring Township, where it heads through residential areas with some commercial establishments. PA 724 becomes a divided highway as it reaches an interchange with the US 222 freeway. Past this, the route becomes a two-lane undivided road and passes through business areas, with the name changing to Revere Boulevard. The road passes near some homes as it enters Cumru Township before forming the border between the borough of Wyomissing to the north and Cumru Township to the south. PA 724 widens into a four-lane divided highway and runs past businesses, turning south into Cumru Township to intersect US 222 Bus. At this point, PA 724 turns east to form a concurrency with US 222 Bus. on Lancaster Avenue, a five-lane road with a center left-turn lane. The road briefly runs along the Wyomissing/Cumru Township border before it crosses Wyomissing Creek and enters the borough of Shillington, where it narrows to a two-lane undivided road past homes and some businesses that runs east- southeast. US 222 Bus. splits to the northeast along Lancaster Avenue while PA 724 continues east-southeast along Philadelphia Avenue past more residences. The road continues east into Cumru Township before it forms the border between the borough of Kenhorst to the north and Cumru Township to the south as it reaches an intersection with PA 625 in commercial areas. Past this, the route crosses Angelica Creek and fully enters Cumru Township again, passing through the residential community of Grill. PA 724 continues past homes and some rural land before it intersects PA 10, where it heads north for a brief concurrency with that route on Morgantown Road. Upon splitting from PA 10, PA 724 winds east along Philadelphia Avenue through forested areas, running along the south bank of the Schuylkill River. The route comes to an interchange with I-176 and passes southeast through the community of Ridgewood, where it crosses the Schuylkill River Trail and Norfolk Southern's Harrisburg Line #1. The road heads east into Robeson Township and turns southeast through wooded areas with some development as Main Street, passing through the community of Seyfert before crossing Allegheny Creek and reaching an intersection with the eastern terminus of PA 568 in the community of Gibraltar. The road heads east- southeast through a mix of fields and trees with some homes along the north side of the Norfolk Southern line and a short distance south of the Schuylkill River. Farther east, PA 724 passes through wooded areas before it enters the borough of Birdsboro, where it runs past residences and industrial development on West Main Street. The road passes under the Norfolk Southern tracks before it comes to a junction with PA 345. At this point, PA 724 turns south for a concurrency with PA 345 on North Furnace Street through the commercial center of Birdsboro. The two routes turn east onto East Main Street and cross Hay Creek, passing through residential areas. At the eastern border of Birdsboro, PA 345 splits to the south and PA 724 continues east into Union Township, passing through rural areas of homes and the communities of Mount Airy and Monocacy. In this area, the road crosses the Schuylkill River Trail twice. The route runs east through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes before it turns southeast and follows the Schuylkill River. The road names changes to Schuylkill Road as it continues alongside the river. PA 724 westbound past its eastern terminus at PA 23 in East Pikeland Township PA 724 enters North Coventry Township in Chester County and continues southeast through forested areas along the Schuylkill River before heading east into farmland further south from the river. The route becomes a three-lane road with two westbound lanes and one eastbound lane as it heads through commercial areas, with the Coventry Mall located on the north side of the road. PA 724 becomes a four- lane divided highway as it reaches an interchange with PA 100. Past this interchange, the route narrows to a two-lane undivided road and passes through the residential community of South Pottstown and intersects Hanover Street, which heads north toward the borough of Pottstown. The road passes through a golf course and runs through the community of Kenilworth, where it intersects a ramp that provides access to the US 422 freeway to the north at a trumpet interchange. After this, PA 724 curves to the southeast and crosses into East Coventry Township and runs through a mix of farmland and woodland with some homes. The route passes through the community of Parker Ford and briefly runs to the southwest of the Schuylkill River Trail before it enters East Vincent Township. The road passes through a golf course before heading into a commercial area and intersecting Bridge Street, which heads east toward the borough of Spring City. PA 724 continues past a mix of residences, businesses, and farm fields, turning to the south. The route continues into East Pikeland Township and continues south to its eastern terminus at an intersection with PA 23. At this point, PA 23 continues southeast along Schuylkill Road toward the borough of Phoenixville. History The Meeting House Law Building, Route 724 at Mennonite Church Road, Spring City When routes were first legislated in Pennsylvania in 1911, what is now PA 724 was designated as part of Legislative Route 147 between east of Reading and North Coventry Township and as part of Legislative Route 201 between North Coventry Township and Phoenixville. In 1927, PA 83 was designated along the road between Poplar Neck Road and PA 23 while the road west of there remained unnumbered. By 1940, the current alignment of PA 724 between Sinking Spring and PA 83 existed as an unnumbered paved road. PA 724 was designated onto its current alignment between US 422 in Sinking Spring and PA 23 near Phoenixville by 1966, replacing the portion of PA 83 between Poplar Neck Road and PA 23. PA 724 is referenced in the liner notes of Hall & Oates' 1973 album Abandoned Luncheonette. Daryl Hall, a Pottstown native, and John Oates approached Talmadge W. Faulk at his restaurant Toggs on PA 724 on the eastern outskirts of town. The duo requested permission to photograph Faulk's defunct Rosedale Diner, which had been sitting dormant across the street since 1965. The photograph became the cover image for Abandoned Luncheonette. In the liner notes, Faulk is simply credited as \\"The man on Rt. 724\\". In exchange for his verbal permission, Faulk received an autographed copy of the first album off the presses. The Rosedale Diner remained in the same spot until it was scrapped in 1983, due to the dilapidated condition it had incurred at the hands of souvenir-hunting Hall & Oates fans. Faulk died in 2007. Major intersectionsPA 724 Truck Pennsylvania Route 724 Truck was a truck route of PA 724 around a weight- restricted bridge over the Angelica Creek in Kenhorst, on which trucks over 20 tons and combination loads over 29 tons are prohibited. The route followed PA 625, US 222 Bus., US 422, and I-176. It was signed in 2013, but as of October 2017, signs have been removed.

He was a member of The Wailers Band. Biography Alvin \\"Seeco\\" Patterson was the percussionist in Bob Marley and the Wailers, and one of Marley's closest confidants and friends. Although known to the world as \\"Seeco\\", he was in fact born Francisco Willie, in Havana, Cuba, on 30 December 1930 to a Jamaican father whom he seldom saw, and a Panamanian mother named Celestina Hardin. He took Alvin Patterson as a stage name, and acquired the nickname \\"Seeco\\" as a bastardisation of his birth name Francisco. He was also referred to at times as \\"Pep\\", a nickname he had earned at school. As a child, Patterson emigrated to Jamaica with his parents, and lived first in Westmorland, where his father farmed, but then moved on to Kingston with his mother, after his parent's marriage dissolved. As a young man, Patterson found work as a bauxite miner. In 1957, Patterson attempted to emigrate to the United States in search of better work. In the midst of his move, however, the historic Kendal train crash occurred in Jamaica on 1 September, prompting Patterson to return to the island to seek out relatives he feared might have been among the nearly 200 dead and 700 injured. His plans to emigrate were then permanently put on hold, and he returned to Kingston, and to the life of a Bauxite miner. It was around this time that Patterson first met a teenage Bob Marley, who was fifteen years Patterson's junior, and living in the same Trench Town slums. Marley took note of Patterson because of his famed cricket bowling abilities, and began to follow Patterson around, in search of both cricket skills, and likely also a fatherly figure. Patterson and Marley grew immensely close and forged a bond that would last until the end of Marley's life. Patterson encouraged Marley as he began to experiment with singing, as Patterson himself had gained experience in the musical realm playing percussion with famed calypso artist Lord Flea, and with other mento- calypso combos.Davis (1985), 38. And it was Patterson who would first take the newly formed Wailers group, consisting of Marley, along with Peter Tosh and Bunny Livingston, to Coxsone Dodd's Studio One for their first audition, in July 1964. The resulting recording session, which took place only after Coxsone's initial rejection of the Wailers, produced the hit single \\"Simmer Down\\" ‚Äì - the record which launched Marley's career. As the Wailers rose in prominence on the Jamaican scene, Patterson continued to work in the Bauxite mines. In 1966, however, while Marley was working in the United States, Patterson was injured in a mine accident, when the gas line running under the canteen floor ruptured, causing an explosion that left a number of miners seriously injured. Patterson was thrown from the room and lost his shoes in the process. When Marley returned to the island some weeks later, he convinced Patterson to give up mining, and to begin working in music more regularly. As a result, Patterson began to contribute percussion tracks to a number of Wailers cuts. His first known contribution was on the June 1967 session which produced \\"Lyrical Satyrical I\\" and \\"This Train\\", and was released on the Wailers' own Wail N Soul M label.Steffens & Pierson (2005), p. 27. While Patterson's role in the original Wailers (that still featured Tosh and Livingston) was small, his contributions gradually increased. When the original Wailers went on their first (and only) tour of the UK in 1973, Patterson acted as roadie. When Marley's association with Tosh and Livingston ended that year, however, Patterson became a core member of the newly formed Wailers band under Marley's direction, and contributed to every recording and live performance that Marley would make for the rest of his career. While no virtuoso, Patterson's inventive style added depth to Marley's recordings, and acted as an anchor to keep Marley's music grounded in the roots tradition. Patterson's milk bottle on Jamming, and his call-and-answer percussion sounds on Crazy Baldheads are amongst the best examples of his style and simple greatness. Although not credited, Patterson is believed to have contributed to the writing of a number of Marley's songs, including \\"Work.‚Äù Throughout Marley's career, Patterson was seldom far from his side. In December 1976, Patterson was rehearsing with Marley at 56 Hope Road when gunmen opened fire on the group, injuring Marley, wife Rita, and manager Don Taylor.Timothy White, Catch a Fire: The Life of Bob Marley (New York: Holt, Rinehart, Winston, 1983) 288. In September 1980, Patterson was with Marley when he collapsed jogging in Central Park, and remained with Marley through his cancer treatment both in New York and then at the clinic of Dr. Josef Issels in Rottach-Egern, Germany. Following Marley‚Äôs death, Patterson continued to play with the Wailers band. In 1990, however, Patterson suffered a brain haemorrhage while on tour in Brazil, and nearly lost his life. Following his recovery, he retreated from the music scene, to appear only occasionally on various tribute shows to Marley. Patterson currently lives in Kingston.

Mintz received his PhD at Columbia University in 1951 and conducted his primary fieldwork among sugar-cane workers in Puerto Rico. Later expanding his ethnographic research to Haiti and Jamaica, he produced historical and ethnographic studies of slavery and global capitalism, cultural hybridity, Caribbean peasants, and the political economy of food commodities. He taught for two decades at Yale University before helping to found the Anthropology Department at Johns Hopkins University, where he remained for the duration of his career. Mintz's history of sugar, Sweetness and Power, is considered one of the most influential publications in cultural anthropology and food studies. Early life and education Mintz was born in Dover, New Jersey,\\"Mintz, Sidney Wilfred 74-75 Soc, Anthropology, History Born 1922 Dover, NJ.\\" to Fanny and Soloman Mintz. His father was a New York tradesman, and his mother was a garment-trade organizer for the Industrial Workers of the World. Mintz studied at Brooklyn College, earning his B.A in psychology in 1943. After enlisting in the US Army Air Corps for the remainder of World War II, he enrolled in the doctoral program in anthropology at Columbia University and completed a dissertation on sugar-cane plantation workers in Santa Isabel, Puerto Rico under the supervision of Julian Steward and Ruth Benedict. While at Columbia, Mintz was one of a group of students who developed around Steward and Benedict known as the Mundial Upheaval Society. Many prominent anthropologists such as Marvin Harris, Eric Wolf, Morton Fried, Stanley Diamond, Robert Manners, and Robert F. Murphy were among this group. Career Mintz had a long academic career at Yale University (1951‚Äì74) before helping to found the Anthropology Department at Johns Hopkins University. He has been a visiting lecturer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the √âcole Pratique des Hautes √âtudes and the Coll√®ge de France (Paris) and elsewhere. His work has been the subject of several studies., in addition to his reflections on his own ideas and fieldwork. He was honored by the establishment of the annual Sidney W. Mintz Lecture in 1992.http://www.jhu.edu/registrar/catalog.pdf Mintz was a member of the American Ethnological Society and was President of that body from 1968 to 1969, a fellow of the American Anthropological Association and the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland.

He received the Franz Boas Award at the 2012 American Anthropological Association. Training and influences In his training Mintz was particularly influenced by Steward, Ruth Benedict (Mintz 1981a), and Alexander Lesser, and by his classmate and co-author, Eric Wolf (1923-1999). Combining a Marxist and historical materialist approach with U.S. cultural anthropology, Mintz‚Äôs focus has been those large processes, starting in the fifteenth century, that marked the advent of capitalism and European expansion in the Caribbean, and the myriad institutional and political forms which buttressed that growth, on the one hand; and on the other, the local cultural responses to such processes. His ethnography centered on how these responses are manifested in the lives of Caribbean people. For Mintz, history did not erode differences to create homogeneity among regions, even while a capitalist world-system was emerging. Larger forces were always confronted by local responses that affected the cultural outcomes. Considering this relationship Mintz wrote: This orientation found varied expressions in Mintz‚Äôs works, from his life history of ‚ÄúTaso‚Äù (Anastacio Zayas Alvarado), a Puerto Rican sugar worker, to debating whether the Caribbean slave could be considered a proletarian. He reasoned that, because slavery in the Caribbean was implicated in capitalism, slavery there was unlike Old World slavery; but also that because slave status meant unfree labor, Caribbean slavery was not a fully capitalistic labor-form for the extraction of surplus value. There were other contradictions: Caribbean slaves were legally defined as property, but often owned property; though slaves produced wealth for their owners, they also reproduced their labor through ‚Äúproto-peasant‚Äù agriculture and market activities, reducing long-term supply costs for the owners. The slave was a capital good, hence not commoditized labor; but some skilled slaves hired out to others produced income for their masters and could keep a share for themselves. In his book Caribbean Transformations and elsewhere, Mintz claimed that modernity originated in the Caribbean‚ÄîEurope‚Äôs first factories were embodied in a plantation complex devoted to the cultivation of sugar cane and a few other agricultural commodities. The advent of this system certainly had profound effects on Caribbean ‚Äúplantation society‚Äù (Mintz 1959a), but the commercialization of sugar‚Äôs products had lasting effects in Europe as well, from providing the wherewithal for the industrial revolution to transforming whole foodways and creating a revolution in European tastes and consumer behavior. Mintz repeatedly insisted on the Caribbean region‚Äôs particularities to contest pop notions of ‚Äúglobalization‚Äù and ‚Äúdiaspora,‚Äù that would make of the region a mere metaphor without acknowledging its historical distinctiveness. Research=Caribbean anthropology Mintz carried out his first fieldwork in the Caribbean in 1948 as part of Julian Steward‚Äôs application of anthropological methods to the study of a complex society. This fieldwork was eventually published as The People of Puerto Rico ? Since then, Mintz has authored several books and nearly 300 scientific articles on varied themes, including slavery, labor, Caribbean peasantries, and the anthropology of food in the context of globalizing capitalism. In a field where insularity is common, and anthropologists usually chose one language area and one colonial power for study, Mintz has done fieldwork in three different Caribbean societies: Puerto Rico (1948-1949, 1953, 1956), Jamaica (1952, 1954), and Haiti (1958-1959, 1961), as well as later working in Iran (1966-1967) and Hong Kong (1996, 1999). Mintz has always taken a historical approach and used historical materials in studying Caribbean cultures. =Peasantry= Worker in the Cane: A Puerto Rican Life History One of Mintz‚Äôs main contributions to Caribbean anthropology has been his analysis of the origins and establishment of the peasantry. Mintz argued that Caribbean peasantries emerged alongside of and after industrialization, probably like nowhere else in the world. Defining these as ‚Äúreconstituted‚Äù because they began as something other than peasants, Mintz offered a tentative group typology. Such groups varied from the ‚Äúsquatters‚Äù who settled on the land in the early days after the Columbian conquest, through the ‚Äúearly yeomen,‚Äù European indentured plantation workers who finished the terms of their contracts; to the ‚Äúproto-peasantry,‚Äù honing farming and marketing skills while still enslaved; and the ‚Äúrunaway peasantries‚Äù or maroons, who formed communities outside colonial authority, based on subsistence farming in mountainous or interior forest regions. For Mintz, these adaptations were a ‚Äúmode of response‚Äù to the plantation system and a ‚Äúmode of resistance‚Äù to superior power. Acknowledging the difficulties in defining ‚Äúpeasantry,‚Äù Mintz pointed to the Caribbean experience, stressing internal peasant diversity in any given Caribbean society, as well as their relationships to landless wage-earning agricultural workers or ‚Äúrural proletarians,‚Äù and how the experience of any individual might span or combine these categories. Mintz was also interested in gender relations and the domestic economy, and especially in women‚Äôs roles in marketing. =Sociocultural analysis= Anxious to illustrate complexity and diversity within the Caribbean, as well as the commonalities bridging cultural, linguistic, and political frontiers, Mintz argued in The Caribbean as a Socio- Cultural Area that Mintz took a dialectical approach that highlighted contradictory forces. Thus, Caribbean slaves were individualized through the process of slavery and the relationship with modernity, ‚Äúbut not dehumanized by it.‚Äù Once free, they exhibited ‚Äúquite sophisticated ideas of collective activity or cooperative unity. The push in Guyana to purchase plantations collectively; the use of cooperative work groups for house building, harvesting, and planting; the growth of credit institutions; and the links between kinship and coordinated work all suggest the powerful individualism that slavery helped to create did not wholly obviate group activity.‚Äù =Slavery= Mintz has compared slavery and forced labor across islands, time and colonial structures, as in Jamaica and Puerto Rico (Mintz 1959b); and addressed the question of differing colonial systems engendering differing degrees of cruelty, exploitation, and racism. The view of some historians and political leaders in the Caribbean and Latin America was that the Iberian colonies, with their tradition of Catholicism and sense of aesthetics, meant a more humane slavery; while north European colonies, with their individualizing Protestant religions, found it easier to exploit the slaves and to draw hard and fast social categories. But Mintz argued that the treatment of slaves had to do instead with the integration of the colony into the world economic system, the degree of control of the metropolis over the colony, and the intensity of exploitation of labor and land.' In collaboration with anthropologist Richard Price, Mintz considered the question of creolization (a sort of blending of multiple cultural traditions to create a new one) in African American culture in the book The Birth of African-American Culture: An Anthropological Approach (Mintz and Price 1992, first published in 1976 and first delivered as a conference paper in 1973). There, the authors qualify anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits‚Äôs view that Afro-American culture was mainly African cultural survivals. But they also oppose those who claimed African culture was stripped from the slaves through enslavement, such that nothing ‚ÄúAfrican‚Äù remains in Afro-American cultures today. Combining Herskovits‚Äôs cultural anthropological approach and the structuralism of anthropologist Claude L√©vi-Strauss, Mintz and Price argued that Afro-Americana is characterized by deep-level ‚Äúgrammatical principles‚Äù of various African cultures, and that these principles extend to motor behaviors, kinship practices, gender relations, and religious cosmologies. This has been an influential model in the ongoing anthropology of the African diaspora. Recent work More recent work by Mintz has focused on the history and meaning of food (e.g., Mintz 1985b, 1996b; Mintz and Du Bois 2002), including ongoing work on the consumption of soy foods.

The fields provided enough space for up to 10 cricket matches at a time. It was the site of the first \\"Roses Match\\" between Yorkshire and Lancashire on 23‚Äì25 July 1849.Haygarth, S&B; volume 4, p. 55. Urban renewal Hyde Park was the site of the earliest large scale slum clearance in Britain, the previous back-to-back housing having been known as \\"Little Chicago\\" in the 1930s, due to the violent crimes sometimes committed there. The area was partially razed before the Second World War. The nearby Park Hill housing estate was built between 1957 and 1961. Designed by Jack Lynn and Ivor Smith, under the auspices of J. L. Womersley, the deck access scheme, inspired by Le Corbusier's Unit√© d'Habitation and the Smithson's unbuilt schemes, most notably for Golden Lane in London, was viewed as revolutionary at the time. Hyde Park flats seen from Commercial Street (1987) The plans for Hyde Park, then known as Part 2 of the Park Hill re-development scheme, were approved by the Housing Committee of Sheffield City Council on 21 February 1958. At 18 storeys, the flats were to be the highest in the country outside London. The building work was undertaken by the Council‚Äôs Public Works Department. The first residents moved into Block D in October 1963 with the project being declared complete in June 1965, when the keys to the last flats were handed over to tenants. The finished scheme had 1,313 dwellings comprising 665 flats and 648 maisonettes, housing around 4,600 people. The opening ceremony was performed on 23 June 1966 by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, who gave a speech and unveiled a memorial plaque. Earlier in the day the Queen Mother had opened the Arts Tower at the University of Sheffield.Sheffield Flats, Park Hill and Hyde Park, Peter Tuffrey, Fonthill Media Ltd, 2013, , Details of re-development. Hyde Park consisted of four blocks A, B, C and D, with each block having a public house, these were namely, The Earl Francis, The Target, The Samuel Plimsoll and The Crow‚Äôs Nest, there were shops, clinic, tenants hall, youth club and a launderette. The concept of the flats was described as streets in the sky. Broad decks, wide enough for milk floats, had large numbers of front doors opening onto them. Each deck of structure, except the top one, has direct access to ground level at some point on the sloping site. The site also allows the roofline to remain level despite the building varying between four and thirteen stories in height. The scheme incorporates a shopping precinct and a primary school. Hyde Park Flats during the 1991 Universiade Further housing schemes were completed to similar designs, include the nearby Hyde Park estate and the Broomhall Flats and Kelvin Flats elsewhere in the city. Although initially popular and successful, over time the fabric of the buildings decayed somewhat and some other disadvantages have become apparent. The majority of buildings at Hyde Park were demolished, with the remaining blocks refurbished for use in the 1991 Summer Universiade, before returning to use as council housing. The Broomhall Flats and Kelvin Flats were demolished in the early nineties, replaced with the smaller Broomhall and Philadelphia housing estates with both private and rented houses. The Park Hill estate still survives as a grade II* listed building, and large scale renovation is under way.

Unlike a moka express, a napoletana does not use the pressure of steam to force the water through the coffee, relying instead on gravity. History The napoletana have been invented in 1819 by a Frenchman named Morize.William H. Ukers, All About Coffee, New York, The Tea and Coffee Trade Journal Company, 1922, cap. 34. The reason for taking its name from the city of Naples is due to the fact that Morize was in love with a napoletan girl. The construction of the coffee pot was originally copper until 1886 when the material was switched to aluminum. The namesake, cuccumella, derives from cuccuma, meaning \\"copper or terracotta vase\\". Structure and use It consists of a bottom section filled with water, a filter section in the middle filled with finely ground coffee, and an upside-down pot placed on the top. When the water boils, the entire three-part coffee maker is flipped over to let the water filter through the coffee grounds. Once the water has dripped through the grounds, the water-boiling and filter sections are removed, and the coffee is served from the remaining pot. If coarse grounds are used, the coffee is brewed quite mildly. Using very finely ground coffee in the \\"Neapolitan\\" style, roasted colour \\"cloak of monk\\", this method can produce a coffee that has a stronger flavor than an automatic drip brew maker. Cuppetiello The cuppetiello is a small paper cone (which is used in other ways in Naples, such as holding food) that goes over the spout. This is used to preserve the aroma of the coffee while it drips into the tank, which can take up to 10 minutes or more. To make a cuppetiello, a small piece of paper is folded to create a cone shape. Eduardo de Filippo offers a description of the cuppetiello and the importance of coffee in Naples. Classic designs Italian Riccardo Dalisi redesigned this classic for Alessi. He began his research in 1979 and earned international attention when his design entered into production in 1987. As they have come back to gain some popularity, Ilsa now also makes them in stainless steel.

His paintings are often sold by auction in Drouot, Artcurial, Christie's, and Versailles Ench√®res. Ahmed currently lives in Paris. Ahmed's depiction of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Painting style Ahmed's painting style is iconic. It stands out from the work of all his fellow Bangladeshi artists. He has a distinct oil on canvas style that is heavily influenced by European artists. It is argued that Shahabuddin is greatly inspired by European artists from the 1980s, especially that of Francis Bacon. Ahmed's works rely on minimalism and stark realism. Despite his European style, he would always address his subject matter as something related closer to home. His works are often described as \\"‚Ä¶baroque- like figures turned towards space seeking light and energy.\\" In his work, the subject is suspended in a mass of monochrome blank space and consists of mostly earthy tones, with perhaps one pop of color. His work is also described as \\"‚Ä¶ figures [that] seem to be enthralled in the cosmic dance at times merging with the ethereal forces.\\" The Freedom Fighter- one of Ahmed's work One of Ahmed's most popular work of art is the Freedom Fighter, showing a figure in motion. This is another characteristic of his works- his subjects appear to be in motion and parts of the subject is always in a blur, gently mixing in with the background. However, some parts of the subject is always distinctively in focus, so much so that you can differentiate every muscle and sinew that is present in it in perfect proportion. This is one of the aspects of Shahabuddin's art that makes him different from his fellow contemporary artists from Bangladesh. His work is described as \\"The imagery of fearless human figures, which are in the motion of running, seems to burst free from their skin with their flesh, blood, and sinew‚Ä¶\\" Although much of his works are about the Liberation War, Shahabuddin has declared that he detested violence and his art was representative of the struggles that he had to overcome as someone who was involved in the war. He also has painted many portraits of important figures such as Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Mahatma Gandhi.

This document denies priestly ordination to men with \\"deep- seated homosexual tendencies\\". While the preparation for this document had started ten years before its publication, this instruction was seen by many critics as a response by the Catholic Church to the clerical sexual abuse crisis. Some critics accused this document of implicitly linking homosexuality to the sexual abuse of children. Commentary and implications The 1961 papal encyclical Careful Selection And Training Of Candidates For The States Of Perfection And Sacred Orders (Religiosorum institutio) stated that \\"Advantage to religious vows and ordination should be barred to those who are afflicted with evil tendencies to homosexuality or pederasty, since for them the common life and the priestly ministry would constitute serious dangers.\\" Bishops had discretion in allowing the further instruction of offending but penitent seminarians, and held homosexuals to the same standards of celibate chastity as heterosexual seminarians. There is no new moral teaching in the 2005 instruction: the instruction proposed by the document is rather towards enhancing vigilance in barring homosexuals from seminaries, and from the priesthood. While the preparation for this document had started 10 years before its publication, this instruction is seen as an official answer by the Catholic Church to several sex scandals involving priests in the late 20th/early 21st century, including the American Roman Catholic sex abuse cases and a 2004 sex scandal in a seminary at St. P√∂lten (Austria).In New York Times: *\\"World Briefing: Europe: Austria: Seminary Sex Scandal\\" (July 13, 2004) *\\"World Briefing: Europe: Austria: Conviction In Seminary Sex Scandal\\" (August 14, 2004) The document restricts discussion to homosexual candidates: as the vast majority of abuse victims were teenage boys, there is no specific instruction regarding nonchaste heterosexual candidates. Two months before his death in 2005, Pope John Paul II, troubled by the sex scandals in the US, Austria and Ireland, had written to the Congregation for Catholic Education: \\"Right from the moment young men enter a Seminary their ability to live a life of celibacy should be monitored so that before their ordination one should be morally certain of their sexual and emotional maturity.\\" Reactions to the document The document has attracted criticism based on an interpretation that the document implies that homosexuality is associated with pedophilia and the abuse of children.\\"Statement From The Board Of Directors and Staff of the National Association of Catholic Diocesan Lesbian and Gay Ministries\\" November 29, 2005.

It has also been asserted that, although the preparation for this document had started ten years before its publication,\\"'Nothing Extraordinary'? \\" in Inside the Vatican (ISSN 1068-8579), January 2006 this instruction is seen as an official answer by the Catholic Church to what was seen as a \\"pedophile priest\\" crisis. Alt URL There were some questions on how distinctions between deep-seated and transient homosexuality, as proposed by the document, will be applied in practice: the actual distinction that is made might be between those who abuse, and those who don't.The Guardian November 30, 2005 Editorial The Belgian college of Bishops elaborated that the sexual restrictions for seminary and priesthood candidates apply likewise for men of all sexual orientations. Archbishop Timothy Dolan of New York has been quoted as saying that the Vatican's directive was not tout court a \\"no-gays\\" policy. In response to \\"numerous requests for clarification received by the Holy See\\", Pope Benedict XVI reiterated in 2008 that the Instruction applied to \\"all houses of formation for the priesthood\\".

It is one of the first skateboarding films to have a plot, rather than simply a collection of skateboarding stunts and music videos. An early version of the screenplay by John Smythe, titled \\"The Rollersurfing Quest for Animal Chang\\", was damaged by some ranch dressing. Producer Stacy Peralta misread the name of the title character \\"Animal Chang\\" as \\"Animal Chin\\", and liked the name so much that the title and the character's name were officially changed.  Plot summary  The Bones Brigade travels around California, Nevada, and Hawaii to different skate spots in search of a wizened old man, Won Ton \\"Animal\\" Chin. The movie is of the old-school nomadic, skate- everything-in-your-path genre with interludes of stopping to rip-up a big ramp, pool or kicker. After much searching and skateboarding, they locate a large ramp in the desert. They also find a Chinese character on the inside of the ramp's spine.

Life=Education Moufang was born at Mainz, where he also received his primary education. In 1834 he entered the Rhenish Frederick William's University of Bonn, first taking up medicine, but soon turning to theology. Among his masters were Klee, Windischmann, and Walter. In 1837 he went to Munich, and then next year took the prescribed theological examinations at Gie√üen, after which he entered the ecclesiastical seminary at Mainz, where he was ordained to the priesthood on 19 December 1839. His first appointment was as curate in Seligenstadt, where his uncle, Adam Franz Lennig, later vicar- general and dean of the Mainz Cathedral, was pastor. Lennig stimulated in him a broad interest for the religious questions of the time. Moufang also taught at the pro-gymnasium at Seligenstadt. After Seligenstadt he was charged with the parish of Bensheim, then of the parish at St. Quintin's Church, Mainz. In 1845 he became the religious instructor at the Mainz gymnasium. Mission In 1854 bishop Von Ketteler re-established the philosophical and theological school in connexion with the seminary at Mainz, and he appointed Moufang regent of the seminary, as well as professor of moral and pastoral theology. Moufang became a canon on 6 November 1854. He was appointed as spiritual adviser and member of the diocesan court on 2 December of the same year. On the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of his priesthood the theological faculty of W√ºrzburg awarded him an honorary Doctor of Theology degree. When Lennig died in 1866, Bishop von Ketteler asked Moufang to succeed Lennig as dean of the cathedral and vicar-general. Moufang declined, preferring to devote himself to the seminary. In November 1868 he was summoned to Rome for the preparatory work of the First Vatican Council, and was assigned to the committee for ecclesiastico-political matters under Cardinal Reisach. During the Kulturkampf, to Moufang's great sorrow, the theological school of the seminary was closed (1877) by hostile legislation. Ordination Bishop Von Ketteler died on 13 July 1877, after which the cathedral chapter elected Moufang bishop of the diocese. However the Hessian grand ducal government refused to confirm that. So the elect Moufang served as administrator only. The ten years that he carried this charge while the seminary was shuttered were difficult for Moufang, primarily due to the hostile attitude of the government. On 16 April 1886 Leo XIII made Moufang a domestic prelate. Under Bishop Paul Leopold Haffner the theological school of the seminary was reopened on 25 October 1887, and Moufang again directed the seminary as regent, although he soon had to relinquish this charge due to poor health. He died in 1890. Heritage Moufang rendered services to the diocese of Mainz as an educator of the clergy. He was prominent in the circle that centred about Lennig, and he took part in all efforts to improve religious and social conditions. He assisted in the formation of the Piusverein, and as a member of the \\"St. Vincenz-und Elisabeth-Verein\\" did much to promote its prosperity. In the regeneration of Catholic Germany his name is linked with the history of the general conventions (Generalversammlungen) of the Catholics of Germany - the Katholikentag. He was, for almost forty years, one of the leading personalities and most prominent speakers. For a number of years he was also active as a legislator. After 1863, as representative of the bishop, he had a seat in the upper chamber of the Hessian Landtag, and repeatedly took a prominent part in the debates on social and political questions, and questions of Church policy. In 1871 he entered the German Reichstag, where he was held in esteem by the Centre Party for his political services and as an intermediary in harmonizing the differences between North and South Germany. The most prominent feature of his literary activity was his work in reorganizing and publishing the \\"Katholik\\", which in collaboration with Johann Baptist Heinrich he edited from 1851 until his death. Literary work  His other literary work was mainly in the history of the older Catholic catechisms in Germany. His chief works on this subject are: *\\"Die Mainzer Katechismen von Erfindung der Buchdruckerkunst bis zum Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts\\" (Mainz, 1878) *\\"Katholische Katechismen des 16. Jahrhunderts in deutscher Sprache, herausgegeben und mit Anmerkungen versehen\\" (Mainz, 1881). Among his numerous shorter writings are: *\\"Die barmherzigen Schwestern, eine Darstellung ihrer Gr√ºndung, Verbreitung, Einrichtung und Wirksamkeit\\" (Mainz, 1842) *\\"Der Informativ-Prozess. Eine kirchenrechtliche Er√∂rterung\\" (Mainz, 1850) *\\"Die katholischen Pfarrschulen in der Stadt Mainz\\" (Mainz, 1863) *\\"Das Verbot der Ehen zwischen nahen Verwandten.

La Provence. Bordoni's year of birth is given in standard theatrical biographies as 1895, but her real birth year is 1885. She was 22 on the ship's passenger list when she arrived in the United States in 1907. She went first to Reno, Nevada, where her father had reportedly settled previously.Moreno, Barry, Ellis Island's Famous Immigrants, 2008, p. 81 Broadway Ir√®ne Bordoni on stage Bordoni made her Broadway debut in a Shubert brothers production of Broadway to Paris at the Winter Garden Theatre and was a successor to Anna Held as Broadway's idea of French piquancy and Continental flavor.New York Times, 4 October 1914. She was in Miss Information (1915) and successive productions of Hitchy-Koo (1917 and 1918).Green, Stanley, Encyclopedia of the Musical Theatre 1980, page 40 1919 audiences saw Bordoni in Sleeping Partners co-starring with H.B.

She also starred in Little Miss Bluebeard (1923) and Naughty Cinderella (1925) by Avery Hopwood, about which the theatre critic for the New York Times said, \\"Of Miss Bordoni one can report only what has been reported many times. Her voice, her accent and particularly her reeling eyes are, as ever, unmistakably attractive.\\"New York Times, 23 November 1925. Noted for her seductive brown eyes and coquettish personality, Ir√®ne Bordoni is probably best remembered from musical theatre as the star of the 1928 Cole Porter musical Paris that featured the song \\"Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love)\\" which became Porter's first big success. Bordoni recorded and sang many times live and on radio Cole Porter's song \\"Let's Misbehave\\" with Irving Aaronson and His Commanders dance band. The song has been included on the soundtrack of five motion pictures including Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (1972), Pennies from Heaven (1981) and Bullets Over Broadway (1994). Porter later included Bordoni's name in the lyrics of his song You're the Top (\\"you're the eyes of Ir√®ne Bordoni\\") from the musical Anything Goes (1934). Throughout her Broadway career, Bordoni was renowned for wearing only the most stylish of clothes, including costumes by Ert√©. During this time, Bordoni appeared in Lucky Strike cigarette advertisements with the quip \\"I smoke a Lucky to keep petite,\\" which was said to have contributed to the tremendous increase in women's smoking in the 1920s.Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, page 360; American Neurological Association, New York Neurological Association, Philadelphia Neurological Society, Chicago Neurological Society, Boston. Bordoni wore her hair with trademark bangs, which she helped to popularize; indeed her 'look' was successfully emulated not only by her admirers and by late 1920s budding Broadway starlet Claudette Colbert. She was stockbroker W.D. Hutton's first customer when he opened his branch office on West 57th Street.Geisst, Charles R., 100 years of Wall Street, 2000, p. 69 During the 1930s, she was a guest singer on many variety programs as well as being featured on The RKO Hour.Slide, Anthony, Great Radio Personalities in Historic Photographs, 1982, p. 19 Bordoni pleased audiences on both sides of the Atlantic, as with Irving Berlin's It's a Lovely Day Tomorrow in London's West End in 1939.The Complete Lyrics of Irving Berlin by Irving Berlin, Robert Kimball and Linda Emmet (2005), p. 339 FilmographyIn Hollywood Bordoni made her Hollywood debut in Warner Brothers Show of Shows (1928).Cullen, Frank Cullen, Florence Hackman and Donald McNeilly, Vaudeville, Old & New; p. 131 In 1929 her Broadway play Paris was adapted to a talkie, also called Paris, for which she reprised her starring role. The film used the Vitaphone sound-on-disc sound system and was shot in early Technicolor. That year Bordoni also performed \\"Just an Hour of Love\\" (by Al Bryan and Ed Ward) for the Warner Brothers film The Show of Shows produced by Darryl F. Zanuck. In 1932, Max Fleischer featured her in his follow-the- bouncing-ball Screen Song cartoon \\"Just A Gigolo\\". Her status as a major star of the American stage was such that in his song \\"You're The Top\\", Cole Porter included the reference \\"You‚Äôre the eyes of Irene Bordoni\\". During the 1930s, she continued to perform on stage and starred in another Warner Brothers musical comedy film. In 1940, Bordoni was part of another major Broadway success with the Irving Berlin musical Louisiana Purchase and again reprised her role in the Paramount Pictures film Louisiana Purchase (1941) with Bob Hope. She had another success in the role of \\"Bloody Mary\\" in the 1951 national tour of the musical South Pacific.Blum, Daniel, Theatre World: Season 1951-1952, 1952, page 149.

Biography  Eberhardt Rechtin was born in East Orange, New Jersey on January 16, 1926. He served in the U.S. Navy on active duty from 1943 to 1946 and continued as a reserve officer until 1958. He completed his undergraduate work at the California Institute of Technology during his Navy service. He received his doctorate in electrical engineering, also from Caltech, in 1950. He was a founding father of systems architecture as a distinct discipline. While at Caltech, and for many years after receiving his degree, Rechtin worked at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It was here where he was introduced to the new mathematics of noise, statistical communications and servomechanism stability by Dr. William H. Pickering and others. The Laboratory was then working on problems of radio guidance and telemetry of missiles, subsequently converted and extended to telecommunications and tracking for deep space vehicles. He was instrumental in extending the mathematical foundations to phase locked systems operating in severe jamming and noise conditions, to coded digital transmission, and to communicating with high velocity vehicles. By the late 1950s, these developments were applied to the U.S. space program. Rechtin is often referred to as the ‚ÄúFather of the Deep Space Network‚Äù, the resulting world-wide network of stations developed by NASA/JPL to track and acquire data from the spacecraft. Rechtin served as director of the project and Assistant Director of the JPL. During Rechtin's years at JPL, he also worked with NATO's Advisory Group on Aeronautical Research and Development, helping the defense organization develop space applications. He continued his role on NATO committees in research and telecommunications when he moved to the Department of Defense. At Department of Defense, Rechtin became the Director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, (later known as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In 1970 he became the principal deputy in the office of the director of Defense Research and Engineering, and then the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Telecommunications. During his time at the Department of Defense, he was concerned with policy formulation and implementation in defense research and engineering and in defense telecommunications. In his later years, this included the development of policies for defense telecommunications satellites, secure communications, network interoperability, survivability under attack, and responsiveness to the National Command Authority, all of which became central to the era's Defense Communications System Rechtin left the government to take a position at Hewlett Packard as chief engineer in 1973. During the 1970s, he also served as a Director of the Planning Research Corporation and as chairman of the Chief of Naval Operations CJ Advisory Committee. He remained at Hewlett Packard only a few years before moving on to the Aerospace Corporation in 1977. His new employer had been founded in 1960 as a non-profit corporation to ‚Äúserve the Air Force in the scientific and technical planning and management of its missile space programs.‚Äù At the Aerospace Corporation, Rechtin was responsible for the growth of the company's work on space programs related to national security, including work for the Air Force on a Global Positioning System. He also led work on advanced weather, communications, early warning, and missile defense capabilities. His years in the Department of Defense helped strengthen the company's relationship with the Air Force. He retired from the company in 1987, but retained his association as President Emeritus. Upon leaving the Aerospace Corporation, Rechtin joined the University of Southern California as professor of industrial and systems engineering, aerospace engineering, and electrical engineering systems. He was an early developer of systems architecture design as an academic discipline, establishing the university's first program in the subject, and writing a number of books to teach the discipline. In 1994, he retired, but remained at the University as Professor Emeritus. He headed JPL's Communications Group in the 1960s, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (later to become DARPA) soon after, and was named CEO of the Aerospace Corporation subsequent to that Rechtin received numerous honors throughout his career including the Department of Defense Distinguished Public Service Award (1973), the Navy Distinguished Public Service Award (1983), the AIAA Aerospace Communications Award (1969), the NASA Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement (1965), the AFCEA Gold Medal for Engineering (1984), the AIAA von Karman Lectureship in Astronautics (1985), the AIAA Robert H. Goddard Astronautics Award (1991) and the (Japan) NEC C&C; (communications and computers) Prize (1992). In the professional and academic world, Rechtin was a member of Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Xi, and was honored as a Fellow of both the IRE and ARS in 1963. In 1968, he became a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1968. He was honored as a distinguished alumnus by Caltech in 1984 and was a UCLA Engineering Citation Award recipient in 1986. In 2005, USC awarded him an honorary doctorate.

During World War II, she served with the Arctic Convoys. In 1947, she was sold into merchant service and renamed Sea Minstrel. A further sale in 1951 saw her renamed Marandellas. In 1956, she was sold to a Norwegian company and renamed Edward Jansen. A further sale in 1960 saw her renamed Slitan. In 1961, she was sold to a Bulgarian company and renamed Pirin (). She served until 1965 when she was scrapped at Split, Yugoslavia. Description The ship was built in 1942 by William Gray & Co Ltd, West Hartlepool, Co Durham. The ship was long, with a beam of . She had depth of and a draught of . The ship was propelled by a 269 nhp triple expansion steam engine, which had cylinders of , and diameter by stroke. The engine was built by the Central Marine Engine Works, West Hartlepool. History=World War II Empire Elgar was launched on 17 February 1942 and completed in April. The United Kingdom Official Number 168938 and Code Letters BDRL were allocated. Her port of registry was West Hartlepool and she was placed under the management of the Dover Navigation Co Ltd. She had a crew of 27, plus nine DEMS gunners. Empire Elgar arrived at Middlesbrough, Yorkshire on 18 April 1942. After loading a cargo of war materiel, she made her maiden voyage on 2 May, joining Convoy FN 697, which had departed from Southend, Essex that day and arrived at Methil, Fife on 4 May. She then joined Convoy EN 81, which departed on 6 May and arrived at Oban, Argyllshire on 9 May. She left the convoy at Loch Ewe on 8 May, joining Convoy UR 23, which departed that day and arrived at Reykjav√≠k, Iceland on 12 May. Empire Elgar was a member of Convoy PQ 16, which departed on 21 May. On 24 May, the convoy was spotted by a Blohm & Voss Ha 139 reconnaissance aircraft. The convoy was to remain under aerial surveillance for the next six days. On 25 May, an attempt was made to bomb the convoy, but no hits were scored. This was followed by a second attack, also unsuccessful. When a third attack was mounted that evening, the CAM ship launched her Hawker Sea Hurricane, but the pilot was wounded whilst attacking five Junkers Ju 88s, of which one was shot down and another damaged. The pilot bailed out and his aircraft crashed into the sea. DEMS gunners on Empire Elgar damaged two aircraft, with one probably destroyed. The attacks continued into the next day. On reaching the entrance to the White Sea, progress was slowed by ice. Two icebreakers were required to clear a passage. PQ16 arrived at Murmansk, Soviet Union on 30 May. Empire Elgars destination was Archangelsk. She moored in the Dvina Bay some from the town, where a new quay was under construction. Amongst her crew were Able Seamen George Kitchener Patterson and Harry Smith and Second Officer Maurice Irvin. Patterson and Smith were awarded British Empire Medals and Irvin was awarded an MBE for their actions whilst Empire Elgar was under attack. These were Gazetted on 30 July 1943. Empire Elgar was equipped with derricks enabling her to unload the heavy war stores (locomotives, tanks and aircraft) from other ships that arrived with Convoy PQ 16. Amongst her cargo were tanks. Once she had discharged her cargo, Empire Elgar unloaded other ships' cargos into her hold, returned to the quayside and then put the transferred cargo ashore. She assisted in unloading the survivors of the ill-fated Convoy PQ 17. In September, Empire Elgar was ordered to Molotovosk. Five ships from a convoy ran aground on a sandbank and she was sent to unload their cargos in order to refloat the ships. Empire Elgar returned to Archangelsk to unload. She was then ordered to Murmansk to relieve . The voyage taking 24 hours due to the poor quality of the Russian coal. On arrival at Murmansk, it was discovered that the port had been under attack for the previous three days. Murmansk was under almost constant attack as the Germans had possession of airfields only away. In December, a convoy reached the Murmansk area. Empire Elgar sailed down the Dvina River to where a jetty served the naval base and airfield. She unloaded a cargo of aircraft from the American Liberty ship , returning to Murmansk on 29 December. Convoy JW 51B arrived at the Kola Inlet on 3 January 1943. Empire Elgar assisted in unloading the ships which reached Murmansk, although this was delayed by problems with her winches. Empire Elgar remained in the Soviet Union until August 1944. She was a member of Convoy RA 59A, which departed from the Kola Inlet on 28 August and arrived at Loch Ewe on 5 September. She was carrying 195 long tons (218 tonnes) of ammunition and was bound for Leith, Midlothian, where she was to receive further instructions. She joined convoy WN 630, which departed on 7 September and arrived at Methil two days later. Empire Elgar departed from Methil on 29 October, spending the next five months sailing between Methil and Southend in various FN and FS convoys. She visited Sunderland, Co Durham from 12‚Äì15 December, the Tyne from 27 December to 5 January 1945 and again from 31 January to 13 February. She departed from Southend on 19 February as a member of Convoy FN 1638, which arrived at Methil on 21 February. Empire Elgar left the convoy at Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, on 20 February. She sailed the next day to join Convoy FN 1640, which had departed from Southend that day and arrived at Methil on 23 February. She left the convoy at the Tyne on 22 February. Empire Elgar sailed on 7 March for Blyth, Northumberland, arriving later that day. She departed on 10 March, joining Convoy FN 1656, which had departed from Southend the previous day and arrived at Methil on 11 March. She joined Convoy EN 480, which departed on 13 March and arrived at Loch Ewe two days later.

Sustainable communities tend to focus on environmental and economic sustainability, urban infrastructure, social equity, and municipal government. The term is sometimes used synonymously with \\"green cities,\\" \\"eco- communities,\\" \\"livable cities\\" and \\"sustainable cities.\\" Different organizations have various understandings of sustainable communities; the term's definition is contested and still under construction. For example, Burlington, Vermont's Principles of Sustainable Community Development \\"Appendix A: Definitions and Principles of Sustainable Communities\\" Sustainable Communities Task Force Report. Fall 1997. http://clinton2.nara.gov/PCSD/Publications/suscomm/suscoa.html stress the importance of local control of natural resources and a thriving non-profit sector to a sustainable community. The Institute for Sustainable Communities outlines how political empowerment and social well-being are also part of the definition. Additionally, referring to communities in Shanghai and Singapore, geographer Lily Kong has paired concepts of cultural sustainability and social sustainability alongside environmental sustainability as aspects of sustainable communities. Meanwhile, the UK's 2003 Sustainable Communities Plan often abbreviates its definition of sustainable communities as \\"places where people want to live and work, now and in the future\\".\\"What is a Sustainable Community?\\" The National Archives. http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http://www.communities.gov.uk/index.asp?id=1139866 Addressing the scale of sustainable communities, political scientist Kent Portney points out that the term sustainable communities has been used to refer to a broad variety of places, ranging from neighborhoods to watersheds to cities to multi-state regions. Etymologically, the term \\"sustainable community\\" grew out of the related discourses of \\"sustainability\\" and \\"sustainable development\\" that gained widespread use among local, national, and international politicians and policymakers in NGOs starting in the late 1980s. The term originally referred to environmental concerns and was later applied to cities. Examples of Sustainable Community initiatives The best example of a real Sustainable Community is Saint Michael's Sustainable Community in Costa Rica. The community produces far more food and water then it needs. It uses regenerative agriculture as a base to live in harmony with nature. Sustainable community initiatives have emerged in neighborhoods, cities, counties, metropolitan planning districts, and watershed districts at different scales pertaining to community needs. These initiatives are driven by various actor groups that have different methods of effectively planning out ways to create sustainable communities. Most often they are implemented by governments and non-profit organizations, but they also involve community members, academics, and create partnerships and coalitions. Nonprofit organizations help to cultivate local talents and skills, empowering people to become more powerful and more involved in their own communities. Many also offer plans and guidance on improving the sustainability of various practices, such as land use and community design, transportation, energy efficiency, waste reduction, and climate friendly purchasing. Some government groups will create partnerships where departments will work together using grants to provide resources to communities like clean air and water, community planning, economic development, equity and environmental justice, as well as housing and transportation choices. Social movements have gathered momentum, spreading sustainable community ideas around the world, not only through example, but also by offering classes and training on sustainable living, permaculture, and local economics.  International initiatives=United Kingdom The Sustainable Communities Plan was launched in 2003 through the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Lacking an official national spatial development plan, the UK employed the Sustainable Communities Plan as a regional development plan targeted at the South East of England. Additionally, the plan created the Academy for Sustainable Communities. The ¬£38 billion plan identifies four key growth areas for development and regeneration: the Thames Gateway, Ashford, Kent, London-Stansted-Cambridge-Peterborough (LSCP) and Milton Keynes/South Midlands (MKSM) . Designed during a period that projected sustained economic growth into the future, the plan's implementation has been slowed and disjointed, particularly since the 2008 economic recession An affordable housing shortage in the UK has also challenged the Plan's implementation.  National initiatives  The Partnership for Sustainable Communities is an interagency partnership between the Department of Transportation, Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

During this economic downturn, Cleveland became a shrinking city as many of its residents moved and homes were turned into boarding houses or abandoned altogether.. After decades of work by city leaders and residents to revitalize this part of the city, the bus line HealthLine debuted in 2008. This bus line increased ridership and helped The Euclid Corridor begin to see the redevelopment of abandoned properties as well as investment in development of commerce, to the tune of $4.3 billion. This created thousands of square feet of retail space and thousands of jobs. The success of the revitalization of the Euclid Corridor is due in large part to engaged community leaders, community members, and NGO's like MidTown Cleveland who worked on ensuring that there was a variety of housing investments. EPA assisted with the redevelopment of abandoned space through their brownfield assessment grants and HUD provided mortgage insurance on properties to aid in the development of Euclid Avenue.\\"Transit as Transformation - The Euclid Corridor in Cleveland\\" Partnership for Sustainable Communities.

In 2010, HUD and DOT awarded the city $1.8 million to support a three-year planning initiative which sought to improve affordable housing, transportation, and increase economic development. The HUD provided a loan to encourage economic growth, specifically through the conversion of an old cotton warehouse into an area of retail shops, offices, and restaurants known as West End Market. The success of West End Market led to 230 building permits being issued around the area in a three-year period, resulting in a successful arts district that created jobs as well as drew tourists and locals. EPA assisted with the redevelopment of abandoned space through $200,000 in brownfield assessment grants which allowed for the city to facilitate clean up, or initiate redevelopment. The city also worked with the Federal Highway Administration in demolishing an unnecessary bridge which allowed for the development of a recreational area with a cross bridge, waterfalls, and walking paths, known as Falls Park on the Reedy. In 2005, a mixed-use development was constructed across from Falls Park with a hotel, apartments, restaurants, and retail and office spaces to help further spark economic growth in the area.\\"Revitalizing Greenville's Westside\\" Partnership for Sustainable Communities.

City government initiatives Cities are defined as jurisdictional units that have small divisions of government within them. These divisions of government have the authority to affect environmental and ecological results. Cities are especially important in initiating sustainable communities because they have local authorities that ‚Äúhave political power and credibility to take initiatives to access and deploy resources in ways reflecting local conditions that allows them the capacity to manage and lead urban development for the good of the environment.‚Äù It is also necessary to implement sustainable communities in countries that are industrialized because cities are where most environmental and social problems dwell. When looking at and comparing sustainable cities certain indicators may be used: *Does the city have any smart growth programs that are designed to ‚Äúhelp manage growth and avoid and eliminate urban sprawl‚Äù and minimize impacts on physical environment? *Does the city have zoning plans that demonstrate goals for the city in a way that create environmentally-sensitive areas and maintain them? *Does the city follow any legal policies that allow advocates and activists to create programs that would help the city become sustainable? *How involved in the environmental and social justice movement are programs within the city? *Is the transportation system of the city set up to encourage public transportation and not private to reduce pollution? *Are there pollution remediation programs in the city? *How politically involved are citizens where their voices are equally heard in order to create social justice and a just community? The 34 elements inside ‚ÄúTaking Sustainable Cities Seriously\\" can also be used to determine whether a city is considered sustainable or not. City examples The city of San Francisco uses the Precautionary Principal as a framework to develop laws for a healthier and more just city. The precautionary principal gives more power to community members by allowing them to stand up against corporations in their neighborhoods and leaves the burden of proof to corporations instead of community members. Companies must prove that their endeavors are harmless to the community instead of the community having to prove they have been harmed by company endeavors. This allows for a sustainable community as environmental justice and social justice are created. The city of Quebec to create a sustainable community through political involvement has dedicated studies to discovering why citizens are or are not politically active. Studies from Quebec have shown that citizens‚Äô internal and external efficacy is a large part in determining participation in politics. When citizens lack the internal belief that one can make change in government and the external belief that the government will make changes according to citizen concerns, political participation dwindles as citizens believe no change will occur. When becoming politically active, a citizen takes into account the history of the city government, the government's actions, and government interactions with other citizens. After noting the city's sustainability level it is important to note what kinds of communities are targeted and how they are affected through these programs and what kinds of strategies are being used to try to create and transform sustainable communities.

Sustainable communities projects have struggled to take hold for: * poor economic conditions and inaccessible housing markets: in the UK's Sustainable Communities Plan, the economic downturn of 2008 has led to a general shortage of housing and affordable housing in particular, which run contrary to the plan's premises of livable communities. Projects have been critiqued for: * lacking a well-developed environmental justice framework: urban and environmental policy planner Julian Agyeman has written about the \\"narrow focus\\" of civic environmentalism that does not take \\"social justice\\" into account, and the need for sustainable communities to be democratic and collaborate with the environmental justice movement. * promoting a securitization agenda: British geographer Mike Raco argues that the UK's Sustainable Communities Plan employs the discourse of sustainability as \\"a series of potentially repressive and counter-productive policy measures.\\". * accommodating to neoliberal economic systems instead of confronting them: while some rationales for sustainable communities conflict with market-driven agendas, economic growth characterizes the means and ends of some initiatives. Additionally, sustainable communities reject the notion that development itself is fundamentally socially divisive or environmentally destructive.  Education  While there are a variety of graduate degrees at universities that touch on sustainability as it related to urban planning and environmental resources, only a few degree program programs exist that train students in the theory and practice of sustainable communities.

It is situated along the west side of the river, adjacent to the towns of Suffield and Windsor Locks in Hartford County in the state of Connecticut, USA. Windsor Locks is named after the series of locks on the canal. History Prior to the opening of the canal, the scows or flat- bottomed boats which plied the Connecticut River could only ascend the falls by engaging local fallsmen to propel the craft forward utilizing set poles. One fallsman was required for each ton of cargo. Not only did the added labor costs make this method of overtaking the falls expensive, but the amount of cargo that could be transported was limited to approximately ten tons. Any additional freight had to be offloaded at Warehouse Point on the east bank and warehoused for later transport or carried around the falls by ox teams. Windsor Locks Canal Company buildings alongside the canal. Amtrak's New Haven- Springfield Line is visible in the foreground. Construction of the canal commenced in 1827 and it was opened on November 11, 1829. The canal was long and had a vertical drop of . The locks admitted craft up to long and wide. The canal was unique among canals of the era in that it was designed with structural reinforcement to facilitate steam tug boat traffic. The design of the canal included a massive head gate with apertures that could be opened and closed to precisely control water levels not only within the lock chambers but within the canal itself. The design feature supported the incorporator's dual intent to profit not only from tolls charged on canal traffic but from the sale of mill sites and the leasing of water rights to mill operators along the last mile of the canal bank. Once the canal was opened, boats were able to carry much larger loads, and the anticipated steamboat services were introduced using newly designed vessels capable of passing through the lock chambers. Charles Dickens traveled along the canal on February 7, 1842. However, by 1844 the Hartford and Springfield Railroad had started operation, and navigation on the Connecticut River gradually reduced. The profits realized from the sale of water rights proved to be the more lucrative of the canal's two purposes. Today Today the canal is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, but closed to navigation and privately owned by the Ahlstrom Corporation,American Canal Society (2004).

It is located from the center of Paris, in the Seine-et-Marne department in the √éle-de-France region in north-central France. Geography In the East, at the distance from Paris and in the heart of Marne-la-Vall√©e, Bussy-Saint- Georges has a privileged position thanks to a high-density motorway network. From Bussy, the direct access to the A4 motorway and the nearby A104 offer easy access to the whole country. The city centre is only away from Disneyland Paris. With easy access to the RER line , close to the TGV railway station of Chessy ‚Äì Marne-la-Vall√©e and two international airports Roissy-Charles-de- Gaulle and Orly, the city has a central position in the transport network. Bussy-Saint-Georges is located in the perimeter of the new city of Marne-la- Vall√©e as defined by the national government in 1966. But Marne-la-Vall√©e is just a geographical entity, precisely divided in 4 sectors. The city is in sector 3 of Marne-la-Vall√©e, also called Val-de-Bussy. In Val-de-Bussy of Marne-la-Vall√©e, Bussy-Saint-Georges is from 1985 the leading and main support of the built-up area, as a real and independent new town () with a unique status of local and new town. The others towns decided to be organized around a common agglomeration system of new towns. Population The city has benefited from one of the most significant growths in France. The population has multiplied by 55 in 29 years, between 1982 and 2011. Bussy-Saint-Georges has a strong power of attraction on young dynamic families who wish to live in a comfortable environment where the quality of life has been mixed with intelligent urbanization and a large set of services for the population. 50% of the Buxangeorgiens are less than 30 years old. Surrounding towns * Bussy-Saint-Martin * Chanteloup-en-Brie * Coll√©gien * Favi√®res * Ferri√®res-en- Brie * Guermantes * Jossigny * Pontcarr√© Bussy-Saint-Georges has built its identity on a green model environment with parks and gardens. They represent 155 hectares of integrated green spaces, of soft connecting links, ten squares and parks in the city centre, eight pools and more than 8,200 trees today. History In the origins, the village of Bussy appeared in 841 under the Roman name of Villa Buxido. In 855 the territory formed a large parish under the protection of Saint-Georges. Nevertheless, the full name of Bussy-Saint- Georges only appeared in the 13th century. The name of Bussy comes from Buscus because of the city's native environment initially composed of woods and many groves. In the Middle Ages, Bussy-Saint-Martin et Bussy-Saint-Georges was unified under a unique landlord authority, the lords of Bussy. Here is the list of the successive lords of Bussy: * de Buci family from 1196 to 1490; * de la Rosque from 1490 to the end of the 16th century; * Louis Guibert and his heirs from the end of the 16th century to the beginning of the 18th century; * at the beginning of the 18th century until the French Revolution, the family of Pondre, lord of Guermantes. In 1789, Bussy-Saint-Georges was under the authority of the G√©n√©ralit√© of Paris. During the 19th century, the town was in the county of Lagny, with a population from 500 to 550 inhabitants. Two ordinances, 6 June 1826 and 15 August 1827 reduced the territory of Bussy in favour of the territories of Ferri√®res and Jossigny. Since 1985, Bussy-Saint- Georges has been integrated into the perimeter of the new town plan of Marne- la-Vall√©e and received a total of 180.50 hectares as additional territories coming from the nearest towns (Bussy-Saint-Martin, Coll√©gien, Ferri√®res). In July 2017, M. Hugues Rondeau, who has been the mayor from 1998 until 2014, was considered as guilty by French justice for illegal taking of interest and condemned to six months of suspended prison, payment of 60.000 euros for damage and interest, and ineligibility for five years.http://www.leparisien.fr/bussy-saint-georges-77600/bussy-saint-georges- hugues-rondeau-ecope-de-six-mois-de-prison-avec-sursis-28-07-2017-7163283.php In May 2019, he was banned from public service for life by the Court.http://www.leparisien.fr/seine-et-marne-77/bussy-saint-georges-l-ex- Mayor hugues-rondo-banned-from-public-function-life-28-05-2019-8081592.php Administration Bussy-Saint-Georges is in the Canton of Torcy, in the administrative d√©partement of Seine-et-Marne; its prefecture is Melun. The canton brings together six towns and 38,236 inhabitants. Before its creation in 1975, the city of Bussy was in the Canton of Lagny-sur-Marne, finally divided in smaller new subdivisions considering the growth of population. Canton of Torcy is now part of the arrondissement of Torcy created in 1993. The subprefecture was opened on 1 January 2006. This arrondissement is the least geographically extended but the most populated of the department, with 10 cantons, 43 towns representing 343,583 inhabitants. The town hall, built in 1850, stands in the old village, on the Place de la Mairie (Town hall square). Main sights  * The tower, the only vestige of the lord‚Äôs castle of de Buci, a fortress offering a strategic refuge dominating the valleys de la Brosse and de la Gondoire, dated from 12th century. The current place de Verdun is on the previous location of the castle, which was surrounded by the ditches filled with water by the same source of a fountain which still exists in the place du march√©. The graveyard, in the north of the tower, beyond the fortifications, was discovered during a private house building in 1960. The tower is 21 meters high and 9 meters large. * The Farm of Roquemont. It takes its name from la Rosque‚Äôs fief, Bussy-Saint-Georges lords from 1490 to 1594; it was also the main source of the lords for the benefit of Bussy fief. Later, the farm was called the great farm of Bussy-Saint-Georges. * The Russon mill, a water mill is located in the street of de la Brosse. The former owner has restored it. The mill was a component of the outbuildings of the Farm of Roquemont. It was used as a mill only for a few months and was otherwise used as accommodation for the farm hands. * The Wash-house, built in the mid-19th century. Bussy already used a very old wash-house close to spring in Ferri√®res: the wash-house of Cessoy. But it was too far from the center of the village and difficult to reach for the washerwomen who used barrows for the laundry. The city council bargained with the family de Guermantesfor to acquire land attached to another spring, in the upper side of the street du Moulin, for building the second wash-house. Currently, the wash-house of Cessoy is private, in contrast to the public one in the street du Moulin. * The Farm of G√©nitoy. The name, genesterium in Latin or genestay in Old French, later g√©nitoire or g√©nitoy, originates from the abundant Genista flowers. The farm was also an important fief with a castle. In 1672, Madame de Montespan had a baby in the castle of G√©nitoy, one of the Louis XIV's son: Louis-C√©sar de Bourbon, count of Vexin. * La Jonch√®re. At the beginning of the 19th century, this was a great farm. The owner was M. Martin de Longchamps, who also owned Fontenelles. It was a f√©culerie in 1836, which dominated all the intensive potato production in the region. Unfortunately from 1845 potato blight affected the activity and then completely stopped it. The farmers decided to replace it with sugar beet. The domaine de la Jonch√®re was used for establishing the installations of the new product. * The current village church was constructed on the location of a medieval church. Fran√ßois de la Rosque, parish priest, member of the lord of Bussy‚Äôs family, celebrated the consecration of the church in 1580. The construction was finished in 1595 and the baptism of the three bells followed on August 22, 1600: Louise, in reference to the foundation of the St-Louis chapel, Isabelle, a first name of the wife of Louis Guibert, and Georges, patron saint of the parish. The church was restored in the 19th century and, at the request of the inhabitants who were disappointed for not hearing the Ang√©lus, the bell tower was raised in 1866 to the current height of 32 meters. The church became public property in 1905. Under the porch of the monument, there is an 18th-century gravestone. It covered the body of abbot Duchesne buried in the chancel of the church. Inside, the body and the transept have a refined ogival style. The beams hold a painted vault in the arch. On the right side, there is a Saint-Georges sculpture. On the left is a chapel, probably for the translation of relics in 1431, given to the parish of Bussy-Saint-Georges by the abott Duchesne, restored in 1904 thanks to a group of the Visitation of the Virgin. The baptistery has a renaissance underbody and the washbowl of a ceremony is decorated with four angel‚Äôs heads. We can also notice an embedded stone font on the left of the entrance. * The modern church of Notre-Dame du Val, built in 1997 by the architectural office Gonot-Marcenat. Fully made with modern components, the dome is in natural copper. The location is at 33, boulevard Thibaud-de-Champagne. * R√™ve de la M√®re: a statue erected in 2010 dedicated to the Boat people and refugees from the Vietnam War. Bussy-Saint-Georges is home to a significant Vietnamese population, and the statue is a symbol for Vietnamese refugees seeing France as a free nation and is a reminder for French-born Vietnamese of their ancestral roots and culture.

According to the BBC, she was five metres (16 ft) long and weighed about twelve tonnes (24,400 lb). The whale appeared to have been lost, as her normal habitat would have been around the coasts of the far north of Scotland and Northern Ireland, and in the seas around the Arctic Ocean. It was the first time the species had been seen in the Thames since records began in 1913. She died from convulsions as she was being rescued shortly after 19:00 GMT on 21 January 2006. History=19 January On Thursday 19 January reports from the Thames Barrier control team were made to the British Divers Marine Life Rescue (BDMLR) that one, or possibly two, pilot whales had come through the barrier. This turned out to be the bottlenose whale, and BDMLR commenced monitoring the whale that evening. 20 January Rescue commences at noon At 8:30 am on Friday 20 January, David Dopin was on a train when he phoned the authorities to say that he believed he had been hallucinating, as he thought he had just spotted a whale swimming in the River Thames. Throughout the morning, more and more whale sightings were reported, confirmed when television cameras captured the bottlenose whale on video. The whale beached several times during the day as the tide went out. Members of the public went onto the foreshore to encourage the whale back into deeper water. Concern began to grow for the animal; bottlenose whales are used to swimming in seas up to deep, but the Thames has a depth of only at most. Blood was also visible. As night approached, there were signs that the whale may have been swimming with the current out of London towards the sea: an unconfirmed sighting by a BBC cameraman at 9:00 pm placed the whale in Greenwich. The area was searched but nothing was found. There were no further official sightings until 1:10 am the following morning in Battersea, after the tide had changed. The whale was monitored until 3:30 am, when Jamie Henn, a Marine Mammal Medic working for BDMLR finally called the monitoring off as the whale would not strand at high tide. 21 January Shortly after noon, rescuers attempt to calm the whale whilst placing the yellow undersheet underneath her At 7:30 am the next morning BDMLR members, along with Port Authority officials, started observing the whale again. It was decided that the BDMLR would have to assist the whale as she was not strong enough to swim out of the Thames by herself, and had been losing ground against the tide. There was fear later in the day that the whale could have perished, as she had not been seen for some time; however, she was spotted by a Port Authority boat at 9:26 am near Albert Bridge. The BDMLR decided it was time to act. With significant help from the Port of London Authority and the Metropolitan Police BDMLR medics decided to deliberately beach the whale at low tide on a sandbank, and then move her out of the Thames. At midday they captured the whale, covered her eyes to prevent her from panicking, and made a medical examination. After two hours, the whale was slowly and gently lifted onto a barge by a crane near Albert Bridge. By this stage there were thousands of people watching the situation develop from the banks of the river, and the images were seen across the world. The excitement of the previous day had disappeared, and there was now serious concern that the whale would be unable to survive for much longer. As the barge rushed along the Thames towards the sea, news channels provided non-stop coverage of the journey. It reached the Thames Barrier at approximately 5:00 pm. Later, despite the darkness, it was reported that crowds were lining the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge to catch a glimpse of the barge. As each hour passed, there was growing concern for the whale's health, and she was said to be taking a turn for the worse due to being out of the water, as well as slowly being crushed by her own body weight. Plans to release the whale into the Atlantic ocean were shelved (the rescue team having previously put out a public appeal for a suitable boat); instead she was to be released off the Kent coast near Margate at Shivering Sands. All this time, the BDMLR were saying the final decision would be taken by a vet on board, who would decide whether to release or euthanize the whale. Later the mammal was described as being \\"distressed\\", breathing heavily and developing muscle problems. At 7:08 pm on 21 January it was confirmed the whale had died after suffering from convulsions. Post mortem A team led by veterinarian Paul Jepson carried out an immediate necropsy on the whale on behalf of the Zoological Society of London. The whale's body had several gashes along its underbelly, head and dorsal fin, most likely caused by collisions with boats and rubbing against the rocky river bed. It was confirmed that the whale was a female juvenile. The results, announced on 25 January 2006, showed that she had died from a combination of problems including dehydration, muscle damage and kidney failure. Reasons for entry Crowds watching the rescue operation The reasons for the whale's presence in the Thames were unclear. A number of possible causes were raised prior to the post-mortem: * Illness: some previous whale strandings are believed to have been caused by physical ill-health, resulting from factors such as parasite infections or pollution, which can disorient whales and cause them to strand themselves in shallow water. * Noise pollution: there have been a number of incidents in which military sonar systems have caused hearing damage to marine mammals. It was suggested that Royal Navy sonar testing may have been a factor; however, the post-mortem revealed no damage to the whale's auditory functions. * A food hunt: it was suggested that the whale may have been chasing a shoal of fish up the Thames. However, the principal food source for the northern bottlenose whale is squid, not fish. * A navigational error: according to the scientists who conducted the post-mortem, the most likely explanation for the incident was simply that the whale was seeking to return to its normal feeding grounds in the North Atlantic and took a wrong turn, mistakenly swimming west up the Thames rather than taking the longer route around the coast. Events after the whale's death It was initially thought that the whale's body might be buried in a landfill, or incinerated if it presented a health hazard. After a campaign by The Sun newspaper to raise the ¬£10,000 necessary for the recovery of the whale's skeleton, it was announced on 23 January that the bones of the mammal were to be given to the Natural History Museum with the intention that they be used for scientific research. Due to infrequent strandings of the species, it was the first complete northern bottlenose whale skeleton to enter the UK's national collection of marine mammal skeletons for more than 20 years. The skeleton was put on public display at the end of January 2007 at the Guardian and Observer Archive and Visitor Centre.First display of Thames whale skeleton Natural History Museum, retrieved 12 January 2006 In 2006, the BDMLR placed for auction on eBay the small red watering can used during the attempt to keep the body of the whale wet on its journey down the Thames. The can was autographed by the rescue team. Following a 10-day auction attracting 50 genuine bids a total of ¬£2,050 was raised. The auction was marred by dozens of spoof bids, several exceeding ¬£1 million. Damon Albarn wrote a song called \\"Northern Whale\\", which was recorded by his alternative rock band The Good, the Bad & the Queen for their album The Good, the Bad & the Queen. At their BBC Electric Proms concert (26 October 2006), Albarn introduced the song by saying: > \\"This next song started off as a love song, for someone I love. And then a > whale came up the Thames... And it turned into a song about a whale.\\" On 21 December 2006 Channel 4 screened The Whale That Swam To London, a 60-minute documentary about the events of January 2006. Other whales Throughout the two days that the whale was in the Thames waters, there were unconfirmed sightings of a second whale near the Thames Barrier and in Southend-on-Sea. On 21 January, whale song was reported around the Thames Estuary. The body of a small marine mammal - later confirmed as a porpoise - was discovered upstream at Putney the same day. There is no indication that this incident had any connection with that of the Thames whale. There had been reports of a harbour porpoise in the Thames near Chiswick and Kew on the Tuesday and Wednesday prior to the Thames whale. BDMLR medics did several watches to no avail; the body of this porpoise washed up nearby on the same day as the whale rescue. In early February, a sperm whale stranded itself in the Humber Estuary and died shortly afterwards. On 15 February 2006, a young adult male sperm whale was washed ashore in Skegness, Lincolnshire. Paul Jepson from the Zoological Society of London performed an autopsy. On 14 September 2009, a young humpback whale was washed ashore in the Thames at Dartford, Kent. It is thought to have died from starvation.The Guardian Monday 14 September 2009 On 25 September 2018, a beluga whale was sighted travelling inland in the Thames estuary and was described as 'in trouble'. He was nicknamed 'Benny' by several news outlets, and was sighted again the following day near Gravesend, Kent.

Biography He was born in Pierpont, Ohio, July 4, 1875, receiving his early education in the public schools of Pierpont and at the New Lyme Institute in New Lyme, OH. He graduated from Hillsdale College with a BA in 1898 and BD in 1900, and then studied at Oxford (1900-02), the University of Berlin (1906-07), and the University of Chicago, where he received a PhD in 1912. Waterman taught Hebrew language and literature at the Divinity School of Hillsdale College from 1902 to 1910 and taught as a fellow at the University of Chicago from 1910 to 1912. He became professor of Old Testament and the history of religion at Meadville (PA) Theological School in 1913, and two years later joined the University of Michigan as head of the Department of Semitics, which became the Department of Oriental Languages and Literatures and is now the Near Eastern Studies Department. He remained at Michigan until his retirement as professor emeritus in 1945. Waterman married Mabelle Alice Walrath in 1906, and they had two children: Dorothea Lydia and Donald Leroy. The Watermans were long-time members of the First Baptist Church of Ann Arbor. A distinguished Biblical scholar, during the years 1922-27 Waterman was one of five members of the translation committee of the University of Chicago that produced \\"The Bible: An American Translation,\\" sometimes called the ‚ÄúChicago Bible.‚Äù From 1938-52 he was one of 31 scholars appointed by the National Council of Churches of Christ in America to the committee which produced the Revised Standard Version of the Bible, of which the New testament appeared in 1946 and the Old Testament in 1952. He served as the annual professor at the American School of Oriental Research in Baghdad, Iraq in 1928-29, and from 1928 to 1931 was director of a Mesopotamian archaeological expedition at Tel-Umar, twenty-five miles south of Baghdad, which was sponsored by the University of Michigan, the Toledo (OH) Museum of Art, and the Cleveland Art Museum. Waterman began the excavation of the ancient city of Seleucia on the Tigris, having located the site through his study of ancient documents and the use of aerial photographs. The results were published in the \\"Preliminary Report Upon the Excavations at Tel Umar, Iraq\\" (University of Michigan Press 1931) and the \\"Second Preliminary Report\\" (1933). Waterman was also director of a University of Michigan archaeological expedition at Sepphoris, near Nazareth, during the summer of 1931. These results were published in the \\"Preliminary Report of the University of Michigan at Sepphoris, Palestine\\" (University, of Michigan Press, 1931). Additional scholarly work included editing volume XIV of R.F. Harper's \\"Assyrian and Babylonian Letters\\" (1912), translating \\"Some Koujunjik Letters and Related Texts\\" (1912), \\"Business Documents of the Hammurabi Period\\" (1916), and \\"The Royal Correspondence of the Assyrian Empire\\" (four vol. 1930). Professor Waterman was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science; the American Oriental Society, 1915 (life member, annual president 1936); National Association of Biblical Instructors, 1915; Royal Asiatic Society; Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis (president, 1946); Society for Old Testament Study; Research Club of the University of Michigan; the University Club of Ann Arbor; and the Michigan Council of Churches and Christian Education, (president, 1937-42). He received an honorary D. Litt. degree from Hillsdale College in 1925 and an Honorary D.D. degree from Butler University in 1961. Waterman also lectured for the University of Michigan Extension Service in Detroit, Grand Rapids, and Ann Arbor during the period of 1945-65, and was a teacher of Bible courses at the First Baptist and the First Methodist churches in Ann Arbor. Active in public teaching to the time of his passing, he died in Ann Arbor, MI on May 9, 1972. Public Religious Writings During his long life Waterman was particularly interested in communicating to the general public his understanding of the role Christianity should play in world society, and his views could perhaps be considered more \\"progressive\\" than those of many of his time. In a series of six books that were both scholarly and directly concerned with the meaning of religion for the conduct of life, he put forward what he considered to be a positive and constructive understanding of Jesus' true message and its Old Testament background. Always concerned about the lack of communication between scholars who studied the Old and New Testaments, these six books together constitute an argument for and an elaboration of two major claims. According to Waterman; I. In the Old Testament there is a largely unappreciated \\"prophetic\\" or \\"ethical\\" religious stratum that pointed toward a universalistic view of God's love and care for all peoples, regardless of tribal or national affiliation. Advocated by a group of prophets ranging from Amos to the author of Jonah, who together \\"constitute one of the most remarkable and significant groups of thinkers that humanity has ever produced\\" (1943, p. 55), this stratum was distinct from, and opposed to, the dominant \\"nationalistic\\" or \\"priestly\\" stratum of the Old Testament that was centered on Israel as God's special chosen people, a series of dramatic interventions of God into their national history, and on a priestly cult with blood sacrifice for the atonement of sin. II. Jesus was not only aware of this \\"ethical\\" or \\"prophetic\\" stratum but he explicitly made it the foundation of his own teaching of an earthly \\"reign of God\\" that was based on loving interpersonal relationships and which was within the immediate reach of those to whom he spoke, open to all regardless of national or tribal identity. Although Jesus' message was misunderstood and obscured by the messianic and eschatological mindsets of the New Testament writers generally and by the apostle Paul in particular, the content and origins of that message can still be discerned by careful analysis of the Old and New Testament documents, and it has the potential to form the basis of a worldwide religious community of all humanity. In these works Waterman himself appears as a forerunner of a non-apocalyptic view of a human Jesus, somewhat similar to that promoted more recently by advocates such as John Shelby Spong, Marcus Borg, and those associated with the Jesus Seminar. However, Waterman placed much greater emphasis on the continuity of the anti-sacrificial teachings of the Old Testament ethical prophets with the public ministry of Jesus, and thereby envisioned a fully biblical religion that included both the Old and New Testaments but which was a distinct alternative to traditional Judaism and to Pauline and creedal Christianity.

It started first as Moskvitch 2138 and Moskvitch 2140 on a modified 412 platform. Pre-production models were shown during 1975. Starting in 1981, the modernised modification of the M-2140 export/luxury model was also designed and branded \\"2140 SL\\" in the Eastern Bloc countries and \\"1500 SL\\" outside. The most notable differences between the two models were redesigned dashboard and front seat headrests in the M-2140. Starting in 1982, the M-2138 models were discontinued and the M-2140 became the only Moskvitch cars available in all markets. It was face-lifted the same year: the shield logo was changed to feature \\"–ê–ó–õ–ö\\" (AZLK) written in metallic outline, the grille coating switched from metal to plastic, and both side mirrors were slightly redesigned to be less heavy. The station wagon variant M-2137 was the last of Soviet cars to still feature taillight fins to accommodate gate opening, until the model was discontinued in 1985. Although originally designed and often referenced to as the \\"fourth generation\\", the series was, in fact, only an enhancement over the actual third generation of Moskvitches, the M-408/412. The brand-new fourth generation entered in production with the Aleko starting in 1986, when both series shared the assembly line for over two years, until the M-2140 was eventually discontinued in July 1988. Models and variants * M-2140 (export name Moskvitch 1500): the original four-door sedan model with standard engine UZAM-412 (75 hp). The 2140 entered production in January 1976 and was discontinued in July 1988. * M-2138 (export name Moskvitch 1360, produced in 1976-1982): 4-door sedan model, similar to the M-408 series, with low-power engine MZMA-408 (50 hp). This version appeared because the plant from Ufa, could not supply enough UZAM-412 engines, this series was not designed for the MZMA-408 engine. However, its success was limited, because it was heavily underpowered , outdated, had a higher fuel consumption, and the price was the same as the 1500 version. However, it was more successful in countryside, driving schools and taxi, where lower performances were not an issue, rather than personal car, although it was also sold to public. Because 21406 appeared in 1978, and UFA factory could already supply the UZAM-412 engines, its sales dropped quickly, as 21406 was preferred. * M-21381 (1976-1981): four-door sedan and ambulance fly-car similar to the ambulance version M-408M of the M-408 series. * M-21401 (1976-1988): four-door sedan and ambulance fly-car similar to the M-412M of the M-412 series. * M-21402 (export name Moskvitch 1500): the original four-door sedan export model with right steering wheel. * M-21406 (1978-1987): four-door sedan for the countryside, with drum brakes on all wheels, towing lugs, and derated engine redesigned to run on low-octane fuel , as low as 75. It had a lower compression 7,5:1, a power of (68 hp)/4800 rpm instead of (75 hp) /5800 rpm and a torque of 105 nm / 2500‚Äì3000 rpm instead of 115 nm / 3000‚Äì3800 rpm. Top speed was 135 km/h, with a 23 seconds 0 - 100 km/h sprint. Not available on station wagon. Also, the rear side where the rear light are mounted had the same colour as the entire body instead of black on usual models, making this as the only distinguishing element from the usual 2140 as well as they were delivered without wheel hubs, and looking at the front wheels, the drum brake was visible and had a slightly higher ground clearance and a stiffer suspension . Like other version, the towing hook on the rear was mounted on demand. The front grill was different, bearing just a simple AZLK sign, rather than the logo of AZLK - MOSKVITCH. * M-21403 (1980-1987): four-door sedan with hand controls for the disabled. * M-2140-117 (export name Moskvitch 1500SL, 1981‚Äì1988): luxury four-door sedan model with plastic bumpers, new safety panel and headrests. * M-2140-121 (1982-1987): four-door taxi equipped with a different engine with low compression (the same as 21406), a taximeter, a \\"Taxi\\" sign, easily cleanable upholstered seats, and synthetic leather. * M-2136 (1977-1978): station wagon similar to the M-426 of the M-408 series. Not many manufactured, it was quickly taken out of production, because the engine was way to underpowered , the engine was to small for the sedan version, on the station wagon it could barely face it due to higher weight. Some manufactured cars were used as taxis. * M-2137 (1976-1985): station wagon similar to the M-427 of the M-412 series. It was the last of family wagon Moskvitches with no actual successor (besides the Izh Comby hatchback). * M-2733/34 (1976-1981): \\"closed-body\\" delivery van, similar to the M-433/34 of the M-408/412 series, built for non-consumer purposes. Exclusive special-versions included ambulance and hearse. * –ú-2315 (2140‚Äì80, produced in 1984-1988): pickup truck commercial modification to the body pickup. Based on the sedan and station wagon.

Film 7020624:All Counties Fannie received an education from Science Hill Academy. Fannie and her husband, businessman James D. Macaulay, lived on South Fourth Street in Louisville, Kentucky. Before becoming a writer she was a kindergarten teacher in Louisville from 1899 to 1902, but after her divorce she traveled abroad and became the \\"supervisor of normal classes, kindergartens, at Hiroshima, Japan, from 1902 to 1907.\\" During her time in Japan, Caldwell wrote letters to her niece, Alice Hegan Rice. Rice decided to turn the letters into a book, after removing any personal details. The resulting book The Lady of the Decoration was published in New York City in 1906 and would be Caldwell's most successful work. Rice created the pseudonymous name of Frances Little by reversing Caldwell's nickname \\"Little Fan.\\" The title was inspired by Caldwell's students, who called her their \\"Lady of the Decoration\\" every time that she \\"pinned on her little enameled watch.\\" The book is set between 1901 and 1905, and is written in the form of letters home to a female friend or sister; it's not made clear. The main character is a young missionary kindergarten teacher in Hiroshima, Japan before and during the Russo-Japanese War. She travels to Vladivostock, Russia just before the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War and makes a number of critical observations. At the beginning of the 20th century, most Americans knew very little of Japan, and Caldwell's novel presented a view of Japanese life that captured the imagination of the reading public, who made it the number 1 bestselling novel in the United States for 1907. Caldwell rode the wave of American interest and support for Japan in the Russo-Japanese War, and supported the Japanese cause throughout. Caldwell eventually returned to Kentucky, where she lectured on Japan and continued to write books after the success of The Lady of the Decoration.

The northeastern edge of the island is the New River Inlet, and the southwestern edge is New Topsail Inlet. It is separated from the mainland by a series of small sounds and channels that make up a portion of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. It contains the communities of North Topsail Beach, Surf City, and Topsail Beach. Along with its thick maritime forests, Topsail Island is also a sanctuary for sea turtles and known for its beautiful beaches. The island lies in Onslow County in the north, and in Pender County in the south. There are only two ways on and off the island: a high rise bridge in Surf City, and high rise bridge in North Topsail Beach. Name origin Topsail Island's name is supposedly derived from its nefarious history, however, this is still debatable among the locals on the Island. According to popular belief, pirates used to hide in the channel between the island and the mainland waiting for merchant ships loaded with goods to pass. The pirates would attack the ships and claim the cargo as their own. Eventually the merchants became aware of the hiding place and began looking for the topsail, which was supposedly the only part of the pirate ship that could be seen by the passing victim. There is a legend that Blackbeard hid his treasure on Topsail Island and that prior to WWII, treasure hunters searched for the hidden gems and gold throughout the islands' maritime forests. History Prior to World War II, Topsail Island was only accessible by boat. Area residents frequently made this short trip and picnicked on the sandy shores of the Atlantic Ocean. Local farmers are said to have driven their livestock across the waterways at low tide to graze on wild beach grass. Treasure hunters searched for Blackbeard‚Äôs infamous buried treasure throughout the maritime forests which covered the island. During the early 20th century only a few structures, probably less than a dozen, were built along the sound and were used as shelter for fishing trips and summer vacations. At the beginning of World War II, the U.S. Army built a large temporary anti-aircraft training base at Holly Ridge known as Camp Davis and took possession of the island. They built the road from Camp Davis to the sound and installed a pontoon bridge across the Intracoastal Waterway where a swing bridge was later constructed in the 1950s. (The swing bridge was replaced by a fixed-span high rise bridge in 2018). They also erected training facilities and support buildings in what is now the Surf City business district. Immediately after the war, the US Navy took possession of the island and began a joint project with Johns Hopkins University known as Operation Bumblebee which was an early guided missile development program. Over 200 missiles were test fired. The missile assembly building is located on the sound at Channel Blvd. and Flake Ave. in the Topsail Beach business district which is now used as a museum and meeting center. The launch pad is used as a patio for the Jolly Roger Motel. Several missile tracking towers still stand along the island. The testing ended in 1948 and the island was returned to the original owners. The roads, bridge, and other infrastructure were left intact and development of the island as a beach resort began in the 1950s. A developer built a brick model home for a planned development in 1952 but in 1954 the storm surge from Hurricane Hazel completely flooded the Topsail Island washing away most structures. The model home survived the storm with minor damage, however the design was abandoned in favor of homes built on pilings. The model home still stands at the corner of Scott Ave. and Anderson boulevard in Topsail Beach. Sea turtles Sea turtle populations are rapidly decreasing due to the increasing populations of humans and rapid degradation of habitats. Recently, efforts have been made to increase these populations by focusing on one main stage of life, the egg site. These sites can be found along the coastlines of beaches up into the sand dunes.Crouse, D. T., Crowder, L.B., Caswell, H. (1987). A Stage-Based Population Model for Loggerhead Sea Turtles and Implications for Conservation. Ecological Society of America, 68. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/1939225?seq=2 There are four main species that can be found on and around the island which are loggerhead, green, leatherback, and Ridley sea turtles. One species specifically that has been the main theme of protection is the Loggerhead Sea Turtle. This turtle has been the basis for the stationing of the Sea Turtle Rescue and Rehabilitation Center in Topsail Island, North Carolina. Their mission is the protection and watching over of the 26 mile stretch of beach that is Topsail Island. They are committed to the overseeing of hatching of the eggs, caring for sick and injured turtles, and protection over the egg site.Beasley, J. (2012, June). Retrieved from http://www.seaturtlehospital.org/index.htm Not only do humans disturb the nesting sites of sea turtles, hurricanes play a large role in this as well. Extreme weather will result in the alteration of the nesting site in a negative way by ruining nesting quality through sand erosion. This will cause the turtles to not chose an area that may normally be a safe choice. Also, a hurricane could drown potential eggs reducing the population of the specific turtle that laid the eggs. Occasionally the number of offspring affected will be negligible due to the actual number of eggs being laid at the time of the storm.Dewald, J. R., Pike, D. A., & Manne, L. (2014).

For hundreds of years even before Topsail Island received its name, turtles were laying their eggs on the dunes. The mission began as a few volunteers but has blossomed into quite the operation now. Founded by Karen Beasley, her dream was reached and included tasks provided by volunteers such as walking the beaches at night staking out the nesting sites and overseeing the hatching of the eggs. Only after Karen's death in 1991 did her mother Jean Beasley take over and she still remains at the helm today.Cothran, B. (2006). Topsail Island: Images of America. Arcadian Publishing. Operation Bumblebee At the end of World War II the Navy took possession of Topsail Island and began a joint venture with Johns Hopkins University and established the US Naval Ordnance Test Facilities at Topsail Island, North Carolina, for Operation Bumblebee, a top-secret, experimental project to develop and test ramjet missiles, which advanced the Nation's jet aircraft and missile programs. So successful were the tests conducted at the Topsail Island site that the ramjet proved its value, opened the way for the advance of supersonic jet aircraft design, and brought the United States to the threshold of modern space technology with the Talos, Terrier, Tartar, and Sea Sparrow missiles aboard naval vessels. The name 'Bumblebee' was chosen, possibly due to the misconception that it is aerodynamically unable to fly, but does not know this and flies anyway. This operation led to the maturing of supersonic aircraft and shipboard missile design in the mid-20th century. With the emergence of Operation Bumblebee it brought about the dredging of the waterway, new buildings of roads, and fresh water being piped into the island.Topsail Beach, NC. (2012). History of Topsail Island. Retrieved from http://www.topsailbeach.org/AboutTopsailBeach/HistoryofTopsailBeach/tabid/94/Default.aspx Topsail Island was the third of three widespread test sites established along the Atlantic seaboard in the closing years of World War II, and the first permanent ground for missile testing. The Topsail Island site, placed in operation in March 1947, incorporated rigid structures that were designed and built for specific uses related to the assembly, firing, monitoring, and perfecting of experimental ramjet missiles. The buildings associated with this testing, the Assembly Building, Facility Control Tower, and Observation Tower No. 2 possess exceptional importance because they are the only above ground resources remaining at these three sites where the Nation's burgeoning ramjet missile program grew from experimentation to maturity. The Assembly Building is a one-and-a-half-story masonry building and the Control Tower is a three- story reinforced concrete building. Observation Tower #2 is an unaltered example of the eight instrument towers erected on Topsail Island. Towers #1, #4, #5, and #7 were converted into houses. Tower #3 was also converted into a house, but the addition was destroyed by Hurricane Fran in 1996. Tower #6 was converted into a restaurant and fishing pier, but the pier was also destroyed by Fran, and the addition was demolished later. Tower #8 is the only tower that no longer stands, having been demolished in 1989. The concrete launch pad serves as the patio of the Jolly Roger Motel in Topsail Beach. Naval and Marine personnel, numbering 500 men, and led by Lieutenant Commander Tad Stanwick, arrived at the site by mid-1946 to begin installation of the facilities needed for the testing. During the next 18 months, an estimated 200 experimental rockets, each measuring six inches in diameter and between three and 13 feet in length, were fabricated at the Assembly Building, dispatched to the launch site, and fired along a northeasterly angular deflection of 15 degrees to the shoreline for a maximum clear distance of 40 miles. Despite the initial success of the US Naval Ordnance Testing facility at Topsail Island over its 18-month span, its location did not fulfill completely the needs of a permanent base because weather conditions and increased sea traffic interfered with testing, and the facility was abandoned and its equipment moved to other sites.

In 2005, its population was 3,285; the postal code is 97772 (APO NY 09026). Wildflecken is in the picturesque Rh√∂n hills and nature-park. left In 1937 the German Army established a large training area in the Rhoen area. Northeast of the village a camp, large enough to house about 9,000 soldiers and 1,500 horses was built. The camp (Camp Wildflecken) and training-area was primarily used by the German Army (Wehrmacht) as well as by the Waffen-SS. During the war several Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS divisions were activated and trained for combat in Wildflecken. Also located in Wildflecken were an ammunition factory and two POW camps, one for Russian POWs and one for POWs of Belgian and French origin. In 1945 elements of the U.S. 14th Armored Division took control of the camp and the training area in April 1945. From April 1945 to 1951, the base was a displaced persons camp housing approximately 20,000 displaced persons (DPs), primarily Poles, operated first by UNRRA, then by IRO. A Polish cemetery holds the camp's residents who died during those five years. After 1951, its range served as a US Army training base operated by the 7th Army Training Command in Grafenw√∂hr,and it was home station for several U.S.Army units to include Armored, Infantry (Mech), Military Intelligence and logistical units, primarily the 373d AIB of the 19th (later 4th) Armored Group. It also served as a base for Bundesgrenschutz (border police) units and later for the new German Army (Bundeswehr). Called \\"The Top of the Rock\\" the small post was among the most feared and disliked of all training areas due to high altitude and extreme weather conditions. The post was home to tank ranges and artillery ranges in addition to standard training ranging. Additionally, it was one of only a few training sites allowed by the German government to utilize CS gas in training. US Units Stationed at Wildflecken: * 2/15th Inf.Bn * 1/68th Armor BN * HHB 1/1 ADA HAWK Moved from Butzbach to Wildflecken in May 1976. Fire Distribution Section moved from Fulda at the same time.

He was a long-standing session player for Atlantic Records, appearing on hits by artists including Big Joe Turner, Ruth Brown, and The Clovers. Walls performed under a number of different names, and is variously credited as Van Walls, Harry Van Walls, and Captain Van. He led the Harry Van Walls Orchestra, and also performed with Doc Starkes and His Nite Riders, and as Le Capitaine Van. Early life and career Walls was born in Middlesboro, Kentucky, and grew up in Charleston, West Virginia. His mother was in her teens (Walls believed she was 13) when he was born. Vann took the name Walls from a man she would marry a few years later, and became Vann Walls (often written as Van Walls). His mother began teaching him piano when he was six years old, and his first experience performing music was in church. Walls recalls developing his signature performing style of playing while \\"stand-up dancing\\" in Charleston's Holy Sanctified Church.Vann \\"Piano Man\\" Walls: The Spirit of R&B; His early playing shows the influence of jump blues player Jay McShann. In his late teens, Walls toured the Southern United States with carnivals, circuses, and variety caravans.Showman in the Shadows He returned to Charleston in his 20s. where he played in local clubs and had a Saturday afternoon show on WCHS (AM) radio. It was here that bandleader Cal Greer heard Walls, and invited him to join his band, which toured coal-mining camps. After Greer's band broke up, Walls formed his own band, based in Columbus, Ohio. In the late 1940s, saxophonist Frank \\"Floorshow\\" Culley came to Columbus and heard Walls play. Culley invited Walls to join the new Atlantic Records label in New York City as Atlantic's house band pianist. After some initial reluctance, Walls agreed.Van \\"Piano Man\\" Walls: The Spirit of R&B; The Atlantic years Walls arrived at Atlantic in September 1949.Liner Notes, Atlantic Rhythm and Blues: 1947-1974 CD box set. He was noted for his unique appearance (Sherlock Holmes pipe, deer-stalker cap and a cloakAtlantic Rhythm and Blues: 1947-1974 liner notes) and for his distinctive sound.Craig Morrison, Vann \\"Piano Man\\" Walls: The Spirit of R&B.; Walls' first recordings at Atlantic were with Frank Culley's band, but he soon began working with Brownie McGhee and his brother, Stick McGhee, at Savoy.Atlantic Rhythm and Blues: 1947-1974 Over the next few years, Walls would become almost ubiquitous on Atlantic's R&B; records. Ahmet Ertegun, the company's founder and CEO, said Walls was \\"by far the finest blues pianist to be found anywhere on the East Coast.Vann \\"Piano Man\\" Walls: The Spirit of R&B; Ruth Brown, who had a string of hits with Atlantic, credits Walls with much of her success. Walls appeared on all of Atlantic's early recordings by Big Joe Turner, including his hit \\"Chains of Love\\", early copies credited Walls but on later issues his name was dropped and credited to only Ertegun, but Ruth Brown claims it was Walls song. While he is best known during these years for his Atlantic sessions, during the heyday of R&B; Walls also appeared on songs released by other labels, including London, Grand, Apollo, Teen, Sound, MGM, Swan, Sue, Chime, Cherry, Smash, Courtesy, Capitol, Savoy, Memo, Derby, King, and Columbia.Vann \\"Piano Man\\" Walls: In the Evening liner notes Notable songs either written by Walls or featuring his musicianship while he was at Atlantic include the following: *\\"Sweet Sixteen\\" (Big Joe Turner) *\\"Chains of Love\\" (Big Joe Turner) *\\"5-10-15 Hours\\" (Ruth Brown) *\\"One Mint Julep\\" (The Clovers) *\\"Tomorrow Night\\" (LaVern Baker)(Vann Walls said he did not play on any Lavern Baker songs also it does not sound like his special style.) *\\"Any Time, Any Place, Anywhere\\" (Laurie Tate) In addition to his work backing other musicians, Walls released a few recordings under his own name. In 1950, Walls recorded and released the single \\"Tee Nah Nah\\"/\\"Ain't Gonna Scold You\\" on Atlantic (catalog #904) which featured vocals by Spider Sam (the pseudonym used by Brownie McGhee). The band was credited as the \\"After Hour Session Boys\\". Walls also recorded and released the 1950 single \\"Easter Parade\\"/\\"Air Mail Boogie\\" on Derby Records (catalog #733) with vocals by Freddie Mitchell as well as the 1950 single \\"Chocolate Candy Blues\\" on Columbia Records (catalog #30220). His last known appearance for Atlantic was on Big Joe Turner's \\"Boogie Woogie Country Girl\\", recorded in November 1955. In September 1959, he made his final recording appearance from this period, on the Memo label, backing Danny \\"Run Joe\\" Taylor, who was credited as Little Eddie Mint. Montreal years and later career In 1954, Walls joined the Nite Riders, a band based in Philadelphia (they would later move to Hartford, Connecticut, where they opened their own recording studio). The group primarily appeared on the Apollo Records label, though in 1957 they recorded a one-off single for MGM Records. During the early 1960s, they also made appearances on various other labels, including Cherry, Chime, Smash, and Courtesy. The Nite Riders toured extensively in the northeastern US and eastern Canada. In 1955, they played Montreal's famed Esquire Show Bar, an R&B; hot-spot, for 19 weeks. It was while in Montreal in the early 1960s that Walls met his future wife, Ruth Palevsky, who ran the kitchen at the Black Bottom, an after-hours jazz club in Old Montreal. They married in 1963, and Walls stayed in the city, dropping into obscurity after the Nite Riders broke up in the mid-1960s. By the 1970s, he was reduced to touring small towns in Quebec, and playing taverns and small-time gigs at venues such as Royal Canadian Legion halls in Montreal. A poster from this era describes him as performing \\"Musique Ha√Øtienne\\" (Haitian music). Walls began to re-emerge in the 1990s, starting with a concert on May 18, 1990, in Brooklyn Heights, New York, where he appeared with his former piano student, Mac Rebennack, aka Dr. John.Pareles, Jon (May 25, 1990). Review/Blues; Making the Piano Jump and Wail. The New York Times Walls and Rebennack would perform together again a few months later, at the Montreal International Jazz Festival. He would go on to play at numerous other jazz and blues festivals over the rest of the decade. While being interviewed for a documentary by Montreal filmmaker Steven Morris, Walls said he wanted to record one more album as bandleader,. Morris arranged for studio time, and over two days Walls and Montreal's Stephen Barry Band recorded his final CD: In the Evening. Released in 1997, and produced by Morris and Ren√© Moisan, it was nominated for a Juno Award in the \\"Best Blues Album\\" category. In 1997, Walls was also recognized with a Pioneer Award from the Rhythm and Blues Foundation, along with musicians including Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, The Four Tops, Clarence \\"Gatemouth\\" Brown, and Gary U.S. Bonds. Walls died of cancer in Montreal, on February 24, 1999. He played piano in the cancer ward almost until the day of his death.Van \\"Piano Man\\" Walls: The Spirit of R&B; Legacy After seeing Walls' Montreal jazz festival performance with Dr. John, music historian and writer Craig Morrison tracked Walls down, and later introduced him to his friend Steven Morris, who worked at the National Film Board of Canada. Morris began filming Walls with a professional crew in 1993, in hopes of eventually releasing a documentary about him. After numerous delays, the film Vann \\"Piano Man\\" Walls: The Spirit of R&B; was released in October 2013, premiering at the Festival du nouveau cin√©ma. Directed by Steven Morris, and produced by Morris and Martin Bolduc, the documentary features footage of Walls recording his final album, as well as various live performances, his appearance at the Rhythm & Blues Foundation awards gala, and interviews with Ahmet Ertegun, Jerry Wexler, Dr. John, Smokey Robinson, Ruth Brown, Ry Cooder, and others. In addition, Canadian musician Michael Jerome Brown, who appeared on In the Evening, wrote the track \\"Cancer Ward Blues\\" for Walls, and dedicated it to him. It was released on Brown's 2001 album entitled Drive On. On October 24, 2015, Walls was inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame.

In comparison with its predecessor, the Moskvitch-401, the M-402 model featured many improvements which included independent suspension with double wishbones, telescopic shock absorbers, 12-volt electrics, more solid and comfortable car body, more modern trunk, heater, standard car radio, wider viewing range for the driver, etc. Design The styling of the Moskvitch-402 followed the fashion set by similar-sized cars of its time such as the Hillman Minx, FIAT 1100, Ford Prefect 100E, Jowett Javelin, and Ford Consul Mk1,Thompson, Andy. Cars of the Soviet Union (Haynes Publishing, Somerset, UK, 2008), p. 81. as well as by the larger GAZ-21 Volga, whose designers took part in the creation of this car.Za Rulem magazine The M-402 was the first Moskvitch designed in the Soviet Union and not based on any foreign model.S. Kanunnikov. The Face of Thaw: Moskvitches from 402 to 403 // Automotive History Journal It utilized a inline four-cylinder flathead engine derived from the of its predecessors. The top speed was , a slight increase over the M-401 series, mostly due to considerable reductions in body weight; it could achieve . In 1958, among other changes, the engine was replaced with MZMA's OHV development, which allowed the car to obtain a maximum speed increase up to and significantly reduced the level of noise. At overall, it was longer than the 401. Though the gearchange had moved to the steering column, the gearbox was the same three- speed manual.Thompson, p. 83. Electrics changed from six volt to twelve, a change already being made in the United States. Radio, cigarette lighter, and demister were standard, at a time when the demister was not so in the United Kingdom. The estate (402-423) appeared in 1957, with folding rear seats and a payload. Proposed three-door and sedan delivery models were not produced. Exported to several Western countries, the M-402 in Norway had an advantage over the Ford Anglia or Prefect, being both more available and less subject to import duty. Limited production of four-wheel drive variants of the M-402 (the M-410 saloon) was built in 1957-1958, using transfer case and axles of the GAZ-69 and Pobeda steering. Its performance was good: ground clearance was the same as that of the GAZ-69, ; it could cross water deep; climb a 33¬∞ slope; and reach . The final Moskvitch-402 was produced in July 1957; there were 94,080 in all (including 18,019 for export).Thompson, p. 84. M-407 With the new M-407-series overhead valve engine, in 1958, the M-402 became the Moskvitch-407.Thompson, pp.83-84. A four-speed transmission with synchromesh appeared in December 1959, in place of the three-speed.Thompson, p. 85. The M-407 was offered as an estate (407-423N), delivery (407-430), medical team model (407B), and taxi (407T). The delivery simply had the rear windows of the estate not cut out and the rear doors welded shut; it was only available to official groups. A M-407 came third in class at the 1000 Lakes Rally in 1957. Like the M-402, there were four-wheel drive M-407s, too, beginning with the M-407-410N in June 1958 and the M-407-411N estate in August. At first, these had the three-speed, changing to the four-speed in 1960. A total of 11,890 four-wheel drive 402s and 407s were built by the end of production in January 1961, a result of Moskvitch being unable to keep up with demand for its mainstream M-407s.Thompson, p. 87. In 1961, the M-407 was further upgraded with an even more powerful M-407D1-D2 engine (allowing to handle the fourth speed on a manual transmission), self-adjusting brake cylinders and hydraulic clutch drive, improved front suspension for easier driving,Thompson, p. 136. and a completely restructured dashboard. This model, manufactured as the Moskvitch 403, served as a transition between the second and the third generation Moskvitches, debuting in 1964, with the mechanical components of the Moskvitch 408 (which had not yet appeared) and the body of the M-402.Thompson, p. 137. The M-403E and M-403IE were intended for export. In 1963, an estate variant, the 424, appeared (with the 424E the export model). The M-403 lasted only until July 1965, with 133,523 cars built (50,612 for export). The M-402 was discontinued by August 1959, with the M-407 production ending in October 1963 (with 359,980 built, 120,903 for export). The M-407 was the first Soviet automotive export to be truly successful in the West. Up to half of all M-407 production was exported for a number of years, mainly to the Eastern Bloc countries, Norway, Finland, and France. In parts of Western Europe, it was rebranded the Elite, to avoid conflict with Peugeot, which had trademarked names with middle \\"0\\"s. A large number of the cars sold in Western Europe were assembled by Sobimpex (known as Scaldia from 1965) in Seneffe, Belgium. Owned by a Romanian-born Belgian, Joseph Beherman, Scaldia was the first to assemble Soviet automobiles within EEG. To keep up with Western standards of speed and fuel economy, Beherman also offered a Perkins 4.99 diesel engine of 1.6 litre and , which was only slightly slower than the petrol-engined model but considerably more economical. The cars received Belgian tires, while Deluxe models were fitted with European-made interiors and chrome brightwork. Test production began in 1962, with full series production commencing in March 1964. Production was of the M-407 and M-423, even though the newer M-403 had arrived in some markets. The Moskvitch-402 and 407 could be considered as the first step in Soviet and Russian automotive history towards producing customer-adapted trim levels for various uses. While the M-407 provided greater driving comfort at bigger expenses, other trim levels included the M-407-424 station wagon available for the general public, M-431 delivery pick-up/ambulance van and even the 410/411 attempt of creating an SUV-based sedan/station wagon.

Works Myra: 1995 depiction of the child killer Myra Hindley by the YBA Marcus Harveyleft The artworks in Sensation were from the collection of Charles Saatchi, a leading collector, advertising mogul and publiciser of contemporary art. Norman Rosenthal, the Royal Academy of Arts exhibitions secretary, helped to stage the 110 works by 42 different artists. Many of the pieces had already become famous, or notorious, with the British public (for example, Damien Hirst's shark suspended in formaldehyde titled The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living, Tracey Emin's tent titled Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963‚Äì1995), Marc Quinn's self-portrait (a frozen head made from pints of his own blood) and Sarah Lucas's explicitly sexual images and sculptures. Others had already achieved prominence in other ways, such as a successful advertising campaign using an idea from Gillian Wearing's photographs. Sensation was the first time that a wide audience had had the chance to see these works en masse. The Royal Academy posted this disclaimer to visitors on entry: London 306x306pxThe opening of Sensation at the Royal Academy of Arts caused a public furore and a media frenzy, with both broadsheet and tabloid journalists falling over themselves to comment on the show's controversial images, and unprecedented crowds queuing up to see for themselves what all the fuss was about. Around a quarter of the RA's 80 academicians gave a warning that the exhibition was inflammatory. They and some members of the public complained about several other exhibits, notably the installations by Jake and Dinos Chapman, which were of child mannequins with noses replaced by penises and mouths in the form of an anus. However, the biggest media controversy was over Myra, an image of the murderer Myra Hindley by Marcus Harvey.Dalrymple, Theodore. (Winter 1998). Trash, violence, and Versace: But is it art?

They asked for the portrait, which is made up of hundreds of copies of a child's handprint, to be excluded to protect Johnson's feelings. Along with supporters she picketed the show's first day. Myra Hindley sent a letter from jail suggesting that her portrait be removed from the exhibition, reasoning that such action was necessary because the work was \\"a sole disregard not only for the emotional pain and trauma that would inevitably be experienced by the families of the Moors victims but also the families of any child victim.\\"Lyall, Sarah.

In November, 2017, she moved from the Times to The Wall Street Journal. Early life and education Morgenson was born January 2, 1956 in State College, Pennsylvania. She graduated in 1976 from St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota with a B.A. degree in English and History. Career She worked as an assistant editor with Vogue magazine, eventually becoming a writer and financial columnist. In 1981 she co-authored the book The Woman's Guide to the Stock Market and that same year joined the Wall Street stockbrokerage, Dean Witter Reynolds where she remained until January 1984. She returned to writing on financial matters at Money magazine and in late 1986 accepted an offer from Forbes magazine to work as an editor and an investigative business writer. In mid-1993, she left Forbes magazine to become the executive editor at Worth magazine but in September 1995 took on the job of press secretary for the Presidential election campaign of Steve Forbes following which she was appointed assistant managing editor at Forbes magazine. The New York Times In May 1998, Morgenson became the assistant business and financial editor at The New York Times. She has written about the conflicts of interests between financial analysts and their employers who generate income money from the companies that the analysts assess. Beginning in 2005, Morgenson has been focusing on executive compensation packages being paid by American companies that she asserts have reached levels far in excess of what can be justified to shareholders. In 2006, Morgenson broke a story about a Wall Street analyst (Matthew Murray) who was fired shortly after he reported emails to Congress concerning potential violations of SEC regulation AC by the investment bank (Rodman & Renshaw) that he worked for at the time. The emails allegedly documented that the investment bank wouldn't let the analyst lower his rating, or have his name removed from coverage, of an investment banking client. A subsequent article by Morgenson highlighted a letter she obtained from the Senate Finance Committee in which Senator Grassley stated that the investment bank's Chairman (General Wesley Clark) had acknowledged to his staff that the analyst had been fired from the investment bank as a result of reporting the emails to Congress.

Although the term is generally used in reference to individuals who operate pyrotechnics in the entertainment industry, it can include all individuals who regularly handle explosives. However, individuals who handle more powerful materials for commercial, demolition, or military applications are generally referred to as explosive technicians. Certification It is becoming more common in different countries and regions for individuals involved with the storage, handling and operation of pyrotechnics to have some form of license or certification. The specific requirements for certification, along with any restrictions or prohibitions, however, can vary wildly from one jurisdiction to the next. Most jurisdictions do require some type of minimum professional fireworks training before being allowed to apply for certification. Australia In Australia, individuals using, handling or storing pyrotechnics must receive government certification. All individuals must meet certain minimum requirements, including being at least 18 years of age and having received approved training, including working under the direct supervision of a licensed pyrotechnician, before being issued a license. All pyrotechnicians are required to maintain a log of their experience and to submit this log annually during the license renewal process. There is a push to form a recreational pyrotechnic association, ARPA (Australian Recreational Pyrotechnic Association) that would benefit those who do not wish to shoot professional displays or acquire a professional license and would rather discharge smaller consumer fireworks that do not pose a higher risk as the professional devices. The association still has guidelines and requirements that form part of a safety strategy, but less training and expenses would be the benefit of the association as individuals do not need the training that the professional devices require. Canada In Canada, individuals using, handling or storing pyrotechnics must receive government certification, administered by the Explosives Regulatory Division of Natural Resources Canada. All individuals must meet certain minimum requirements, including being at least 18 years of age and having received government training, before being issued a license. All pyrotechnicians, of any classification or certification, are required to maintain a log of their experience. Certification for the use of proximate (indoor) pyrotechnics in Canada is separate from certification for display fireworks, and different government training and certification must be obtained. The available licenses for the use of proximate pyrotechnics are sub-divided into one of 6 categories. =Pyrotechnician= The Pyrotechnician classification is the primary classification in Canada. Individuals may use a restricted list of pyrotechnics individually, but may fabricate, handle, and set up a broader list of pyrotechnics typically prohibited to the pyrotechnician under the direct supervision of a higher-licensed individual. After two years of verifiable experience with a sufficient assortment of pyrotechnics, pyrotechnicians may apply for advancement to Senior Pyrotechnician certification. Certification is valid for five years. =Senior Pyrotechnician= The Senior Pyrotechnician classification is the intermediate classification in Canada. Individuals can supervise other pyrotechnicians and use any pyrotechnic device or product approved for use in Canada, and may also fabricate, handle, and set up a special-purpose or custom-fabricated pyrotechnics typically prohibited while under the direct supervision of a Special Effects Technician. After two years of verifiable experience with a sufficient assortment of pyrotechnics, pyrotechnicians may apply for advancement to Special Effects Technician certification. Certification is valid for five years. =Special Effects Technician= The Special Effects Technician classification is the most advanced classification in Canada. Individuals may use any pyrotechnic device or product approved for use in Canada, and may also fabricate, handle, and set up a special-purpose or custom-fabricated pyrotechnics device typically prohibited. A Special Effects Technician may also apply for special certification to use restricted material, such as detonating cord and exploding bolts. Certification is valid for five years. =Authorities Having Jurisdiction= Authorities Having Jurisdiction (AHJ) are individuals certified by the Explosive Regulatory Division to inspect and approve pyrotechnic events, including members of agencies associated with pyrotechnics such as fire departments and police forces. Unlike other certification classes, Authorities Having Jurisdiction are not required to pay fees to attend training sessions. =Out-of-Country Technicians= Pyrotechnicians based outside of Canada participating in the production of a pyrotechnics special effects event in Canada are required to obtain a Visitor Card at either a Pyrotechnician or Special Effects Technician equivalent level. A certified Canadian technician of the applicable class must also be employed for the production. Visitor Cards are valid for one year. Alternately, pyrotechnicians based outside of Canada may apply for Canadian certification, provided they meet the minimum requirements and attend the Explosive Regulatory Division certification training. United States There is no national certification or licensing requirements for pyrotechnicians in the United States, however, many individual states implement their own certification or licensing programs. Not all states have reciprocity agreements in regards to honouring another state's certification, so it is not uncommon for pyrotechnicians to have certifications from multiple states. Certain states require certification to store, handle and operate fireworks but not proximate (indoor) pyrotechnics; other states use the same certification for all pyrotechnics. Professional pyrotechnic companies typically have licenses issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives with regard to manufacturer and distribution of pyrotechnic materials. A special category of driver's license is required for anyone who wishes to transport pyrotechnic materials by vehicle.

Prokaryotes For most prokaryotic chromosomes, the replicon is the entire chromosome. One notable exception found comes from archaea, where two Sulfolobus species have been shown to contain three replicons. Examples of bacterial species that have been found to possess multiple replicons include: Rhodobacter sphaeroides (2), Vibrio cholerae, and Burkholderia multivorans (3). These \\"secondary\\" (or tertiary) chromosomes are often described as a molecule that is a mixture between a true chromosome and a plasmid and are sometimes called \\"chromids\\". Various Azospirillum species possess 7 replicons, Azospirillum lipoferum, for instance, has 1 bacterial chromosome, 5 chromids, and 1 plasmid. Plasmids and bacteriophages are usually replicated as single replicons, but large plasmids in Gram-negative bacteria have been shown to carry several replicons.

In Scottish Gaelic the word is (; plural ). The word is often anglicised as shanachie. The word seancha√≠, which was spelled seanchaidhe (plural seanchaidhthe) before the Irish-language spelling reform of 1948, means a bearer of \\"old lore\\" (seanchas). In the Gaelic culture, long lyric poems which were recited by bards (fil√≠), in a tradition echoed by the seanchaithe. Traditional art Seanchaithe were servants to the heads of the lineages and kept track of important information for them: laws, genealogies, annals, literature, etc. After the destruction of Gaelic civilization in the 1600s as a result of the English conquests, these more formal roles ceased to exist and the term seancha√≠ came to be associated instead with traditional storytellers from the lower classes. The seanchaithe made use of a range of storytelling conventions, styles of speech and gestures that were peculiar to the Irish folk tradition and characterized them as practitioners of their art. Although tales from literary sources found their way into the repertoires of the seanchaithe, a traditional characteristic of their art was the way in which a large corpus of tales was passed from one practitioner to another without ever being written down. Seanchaithe passed information orally through storytelling from one generation to the next about Irish folklore, myth, history and legend, in medieval times.Study Ireland:Storytelling, BBC Northern Ireland The distinctive role and craft of the seancha√≠ is particularly associated with the Gaeltacht (the Irish-speaking areas of Ireland), although storytellers recognizable as seanchaithe were also to be found in rural areas throughout English-speaking Ireland. In their storytelling, some displayed archaic Hiberno-English idioms and vocabulary distinct from the style of ordinary conversation. Modern times Members of the Irish Cultural Revival took a great interest in the art of the seancha√≠, and through them the stories that they told were written down, published, and distributed to a global audience. At events such as mummers' festival in New Inn, County Galway, and the All- Ireland Fleadh Ceoil storytellers who preserve the stories and oratory style of the seanchaithe continue to display their art and compete for awards. Eddie Lenihan is one notable modern-day seancha√≠, based in County Clare. Actor Eamon Kelly was well known for his portrayals of the traditional seanacha√≠, and ran several series of one-man shows in Dublin's Abbey Theatre. Other uses of the term The term is also found within Scottish Gaelic and Manx where it is spelt seanchaidh () and shennaghee () respectively. All uses ultimately have their roots in the traditional poets attached to the households of ancient Gaelic nobility. In Scotland, it is commonly anglicised as shen(n)achie.Robinson, M (1985) The Concise Scots Dictionary Chambers, Oxford The Shanachies are a cricket club playing in the Inner West Harbour grade competition in Sydney.

History It was named after the Royal Vasa Dynasty. The park lies between the two squares Odenplan and Sankt Eriksplan. South of the park lies the Sabbatsberg hospital. Vasaparken was established in this area in 19th century. Construction work for the park was started in 1898 and in 1900 the eastern part was almost completed with work continued in the west and southwest until 1908. During World War I, the park was used to grow potatoes for the city. The world-famous Swedish children‚Äôs book writer Astrid Lindgren lived in a building by the park, and Vasaparken is mentioned in many of her books. After her death, a corner of the park was renamed in honor of Astrid Lindgren (Astrid Lindgrens terrass). In 1917, a statue named Arbetaren, by artist Gottfrid Larsson, was erected in the park to honor the Swedish working class. There is also a statue named Romeo and Juliet by artist Olov Thorwald Olsson (1903-1982).

The castle was part of lands fought over by the lords of Alviano and the Roman Catholic Church. In 1481 Pope Sixtus IV gave the fief of to Lucrezia Appiani of Aragon, widow of Pino III Ordelaffi. The castle and lands are purchased by the Farnese family in 1514. They sell the fief of Giove for 65,000 scudi to the Mattei brothers Ciriaco and Asdrubale; the transfer was confirmed by Pope Clement VIII. In 1643 Pope Urban VIII issued a papal bull recognising Giove as a Duchy of the Mattei, thus making Girolamo Mattei, Duca di Giove. The arrival of Napoleon's troops in the territory in 1796, led to Giove becoming part of the Trasimeno department, directly dependent on the imperial government of France.

The hill is a long ridge running up the east side of the Severn Valley and peaks at 202 metres near the village of Shatterford on the A442 road between Kidderminster and Bridgnorth. The ridge offers unhindered views across the Severn Valley out west to the Clee Hills, Caer Caradoc, the Long Mynd and on clear days to the hills of Wales. To the east is Kidderminster and the Clent Hills, and the urban West Midlands areas of Dudley beyond. To the north the Wrekin dominates the horizon near Telford, whilst to the south are the Malvern Hills. Although the triangulation pillar that officially marks the summit of the hill is in a field with no public access, next to a small mast, a viewpoint is provided on the Shatterford-Trimpley road with a small layby opposite. Villages along the hill include (south to north), Trimpley, Shatterford and Romsley. The road following the crown of the ridge was probably the Micclan strete (great made-road), mentioned in the Anglo-Saxon bounds of Wolverley. This may have been part of an ancient road from Gloucester and Worcester to Chester. From Shatterford through Romsley and Quatt, thus became part of the Kidderminster to Bridgnorth turnpike, until an easier road (now A442) was built in the 1830s.P. W.

The ridge comes to a fairly abrupt end to the south, capped by Wassell Wood, where earthworks can still be seen from fortified enclosure of unknown date. The name \\"Wassell\\" is derived from the Anglo-Saxon \\"Weardsetl\\" meaning a watchplace.

Atmosphere  The festival recreates an English village of the period, to the point that they recreate the caste system of the time. The cast is divided into groups based on their character's social class. The highest class consists of Queen Elizabeth I and her royal court of nobility and knights. Following them would be the mayor, clergy, rich middle class, and visiting royal dignitaries. The middle class consists of merchants and tradesmen; characters with employment. The lower class consists of farmers, beggars, pirates, actors, and gypsies.

Bellang√© held an eminent position among the representatives of the decorative arts at the beginning of the nineteenth century. He gained his master craftsman title on October 24, 1788. Among his work from this time were four chairs in mahogany described as being \\"of the Gothic type\\" that he created for Count Esterhazy. Bellang√© was designated several times as arbitrator or expert in trials brought before the tribunal of commerce. At the end of 1811, he became the \\"Imperial Furniture Warehouse.\\" Suites of furniture by Bellang√© were provided for many European courts including the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark. Bellange's work is often classified as Empire Style a reference to the First French Empire under Napoleon I. Motifs included swans favored by Napoleon's first wife Jos√©phine de Beauharnais, honeybees (a symbol for Napoleon), laurel branches, laurel wreaths, and Roman eagles. Bellang√©'s furniture often showcases the dense grain of mahogony, combined with gilded bronze or carved and gilded relief decoration. His highest style court furniture was built of gilded beech and upholstered in silk lampas fabrics in saturated colors, often with a gold jacquard pattern of medallions, eagles, or the arms of the court or family the piece was manufactured for.

History Sibelius was commissioned to write the symphony by the Finnish government in honour of his 50th birthday, 8 December 1915, which had been declared a national holiday. The symphony was originally composed in 1915; it was revised in 1916 and 1919. During its composition, Sibelius wrote of the symphony in his diary, \\"It is as if God Almighty had thrown down pieces of a mosaic for heaven's floor and asked me to find out what was the original pattern.\\" (Entry of 10 April 1915.) The original version of the work was premiered by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Sibelius on his 50th birthday. The second version, only part of which survives, was first performed by the Orchestra of Turun Soitannollinen Seura in Turku exactly one year later. The final version, which is the one most commonly performed today, was premiered again by the Helsinki Philharmonic, conducted by Sibelius, on 24 November 1919. The first version of the new symphony kept much of his familiar orchestral style (consonant sonorities, woodwind lines in parallel thirds, rich melodic development, etc.) but also shows some similarities with the more modernist Fourth Symphony, featuring a few bitonal passages. The 1919 version seems more straightforward, monumental and classical, and also cleared away some digressions and ornaments. Sibelius commented on his revision: \\"I wished to give my symphony another ‚Äì more human ‚Äì form. More down-to-earth, more vivid.\\"Cf. Kari Kilpel√§inen, Booklet of the BIS-recording of the original version 1919 (Osmo V√§nsk√§, Sinfonia Lahti) The 1910s were a decade of change for the symphonic form, which had by then existed for well over a century. Meanwhile, various landmark works in other genres had presented further radical developments. In 1909, Arnold Schoenberg pushed for more and more dissonant and chromatic harmonies in his Five Pieces for Orchestra, Op. 16. From 1910‚Äì1913, Igor Stravinsky premiered his innovative and revolutionary ballets The Firebird, Petrushka, and The Rite of Spring. Maurice Ravel and Claude Debussy were at work developing and performing their impressionistic music. Though he had been in the public spotlight for nearly twenty years, Sibelius found his works receiving poor reviews for the first time with the 1911 premiere of his Symphony No. 4 and, as James Hepokoski has written, \\"was beginning to sense his own eclipse as a contending modernist.\\" These events may have brought Sibelius to a point of crisis, forcing him to choose between changing his style to fit with the radical changes in tonality and rhythmic language prevalent among younger composers around 1910, or continuing to develop the musical language he felt familiar with. The Finnish conductor and Sibelius specialist Hannu Lintu, in discussing Symphony No. 5 on television in 2018, said that Sibelius seems to have made a definite choice, a year or two after his previous symphony, to stay within the frames of harmonic language of late-19th-century romanticism; instead he would innovate in the realms of macrostructure and instrumental colouring. Instrumentation The symphony is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani, and strings. Structure This symphony is unusual in its structure: Of Sibelius's multi- movement symphonies, this is the only one where every movement is in a major key. The symphony's form is symmetrical when it comes to tempo: the first movement starts slow but ends with the fast scherzo. The second movement is neither slow nor fast; it forms a calm intermezzo. Then the third movement begins fast but ends slowly. The duration is approximately 32 minutes. First movement Sibelius originally intended this to be two separate movements, but linked the slower introduction with the faster, waltz-like \\"scherzo\\" section to create a single form. The movement opens with a \\"horn call\\", containing much of the musical material of the work. : \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\key ees \\\\major \\\\time 12/8 \\\\tempo \\"Tempo molto moderato\\" \\\\partial 8*5 bes4~\\\\p\\\\<( bes2.~  bes4 ees8 f) bes4-- g-- ees8 f4.\\\\fermata } Though written in sonata form, the first movement can be structurally analysed in many different ways.

Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1993. ‚Äì have their disagreements and individual ideas as to the movement's formal divides. They debate such points as its separation into two movements, the existence of two expositions, how to functionally describe the Scherzo and Trio, and the exact location of the beginning of the recapitulation and coda. =Differing analytical views= Gray, the first musicologist to write on the piece's structure, makes no mention of sonata form, yet refers to the existence of two different subjects, seeming to imply that the movement is in sonata form. Abraham is one of the first to analyse the work in terms of sonata form and clearly lays out where he believes each section begins and why. He shows that the work opens with a double exposition, each with distinct A- and B-group material, then moves into the development of this material. He explains the distinctly melodic section beginning at the Allegro moderato as a Scherzo and Trio used as a substitute for the second half of the development. Layton disagrees with Abraham and considers the Scherzo to be the beginning of the recapitulation. Most musicologists agreed with this analysis until Hepokoski's 1993 text Sibelius: Symphony No. 5 offered an altogether different interpretation. He argues that the piece can only be analysed in terms of what he has called \\"rotational form\\". He maintains the same divisional sections of the movement ‚Äì double exposition, Scherzo, and recapitulation ‚Äì but uses new vocabulary for its analysis. Hepokoski argues that Sibelius allows the material to determine form in many of his works, developing by the necessity of the music and not by an 18th- or 19th-century template; in the Fifth Symphony a circular rotation or strophe passes through sections of material, further developing it with each rotation. Through this analysis Hepokoski maintains the general location of sectional changes described by the earlier musicologists and agrees that the movement can roughly be analysed in sonata form. Fusion of movements The first analytical point at which musicologists have disagreed is how to confront the clear separation of the first movement into two parts. In fact, in the first two versions of the work, Sibelius divided his symphony into four movements with the Allegro moderato section of what is now the first movement separated to form a Scherzo movement. In the final 1919 version, the character changes at this point with what Gray describes as \\"superficial dissimilarity and independence of each other\\". Earlier musicologists like Parmet analysed the movement as two separate parts while Gray stressed the separateness of these sections while acknowledging their coexistence in one movement. They did so because of the clear meter change from to . Furthermore, after this meter change, where rehearsal letters should continue from N to the end of the alphabet, they return to A, a clear sign of a beginning of a new movement. More recent musicologists disagree with this separation into two movements on the grounds that both sections are based on the same material and in combination allow for analysis in sonata form. Abraham cites as precedent the fusion of these sections in Sibelius's Symphony No. 2 and Symphony No. 3, where the Scherzo and Finale movements are combined into one. The fusion is reflected in the score as well. Though there is a change in meter at measure 114, the tempo and compound division of the beat do not change: four measures of the Allegro moderato correspond to one measure of the previous section. The gradual accelerando, which begins at the end (the climax) of the opening Tempo molto moderato and leads into the Allegro moderato Scherzo, continues uninterrupted to the end of the movement; indeed, without access to a score, it is difficult for the listener to identify exactly where the Scherzo section begins. Most importantly, the clear use and development of the same materials throughout indicate that this is indeed one movement. In fact, Sibelius himself most likely thought of it as one movement as he published and performed the first movement of his final 1919 version without break. Double exposition The second point that musicologists have disputed about the first movement is the existence of two expositions. The symphony begins with soft calls in the horns, the first horn playing what becomes the main material of the A-group while the others play long notes below. The music has its own rhythmic character (\\"long-short-short-long\\") and is centred on the interval of the perfect fourth. This first theme continues in the horns and bassoons while increasingly the music is developed by the woodwinds playing sixteenth-notes in parallel third motion until the second theme is presented and eventually takes over in measure 9. It is agreed that the B-group begins by measure 18. At this point a third theme is heard in the woodwinds ‚Äì like the first theme also built on the perfect fourth but this time with the defining rhythm \\"short-long-short\\" ‚Äì with tremolo accompaniment in the strings. At measure 28, the fourth theme enters still in G major and distinguished by its duple (equal) subdivision of the beat in the horns and woodwinds as a chorale-like chord progression. This exposition concludes with the return of the third theme, now rhythmically in diminution and melodically circular, fading away to an afterthought. Hepokoski points out that one would expect the end of an exposition to come with a clear cadence in the new key, in this case G major. But as the third theme fades away it is replaced in measure 36 by the first theme of the A-group, here still in G major. Though this next section proceeds in an unexpected key ‚Äì G major then changing back to the tonic E in measure 41 ‚Äì Abraham and Layton both consider it a second or \\"counter\\" exposition, like the 18th-century repeat of the exposition. They reference the recurrence of both the A- and B-groups almost in their entirety, though here they are used to emphasize the tonic. Hepokoski disagrees and instead uses his rotational form terminology to talk about these two sections as \\"Rotation 1, bars 3‚Äì35 (referential statement: 'expositional space')\\" and \\"Rotation 2, bars 36‚Äì71 (complementary rotation/'developmental exposition')\\" respectively. He does so based on Sibelius's choice of keys and the inclusion of developmental qualities that are used to lead toward the climax of the movement. First, whereas the A-group of the first rotation contains no accompaniment, the A-group of the second rotation contains tremolo accompaniment in the strings. Second, the key changes much earlier than previously. In measure 41, Sibelius goes back to E major while still in the middle of the A-group and concludes this exposition section in this tonic key as no sonata form exposition would. Finally, the second theme in the woodwinds is developed with the sixteenth-note runs sooner and much longer than before. This section ends just as the previous one does with the third theme in diminution fading away to nothing without cadence in the strings and woodwinds. What follows is a developmental section (what Hepokoski calls Rotation 3) based on the insignificant transition that anticipated the string entrance before the B-group in the first exposition. This is followed by the development of B-group material which is brought back as the mood changes to Largamente in measure 92. Scherzo At the Allegro moderato in measure 114, the music changes as the second half of the movement begins in Scherzo style. Though all musicologists talk about this next section as a Scherzo, Abraham and Preston StedmanStedman, Preston. The Symphony, Second Edition. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 1992, 1979. also analyse it as a continuation of the development. This has created yet another point at which musicologists have disagreed on the structural analysis. The new melodic theme that pervades the first half of the Scherzo is developed out of the second theme material of the A-group yet based on material from the first theme. These sixteenth-notes act as the pick-ups to this new theme. The key returns to E major at measure 158 (rehearsal letter B) while the Scherzo continues to develop the same material. Like any traditional Scherzo, Abraham explains that this too has a Trio section that begins at measure 218 (letter D). This starts out in E major with an apparently new and distinctive trumpet melody (the timpani reinforcing the rhythm), though quickly changes to B major (bassoon and horns). This section is characterized by this new melodic material, which develops what was heard earlier and is also closely related to material from the A-group. This section can also be considered developmental as this melody is passed around the orchestra in a quasi-fugal manner. Other musicologists have analysed these Scherzo and Trio sections very differently. Recapitulation The most contested point musicologists make is the location of the beginning of the recapitulation. Hepokoski points out this ambiguity early in his analysis as consequence of \\"sonata deformation\\". Abraham explains that the Scherzo repeat after the conclusion of the Trio in measure 298 also acts as the movement's recapitulation. This section is still very Scherzo-like but is based on transformed material of the A-group. In measure 274 (letter G), the key returns to E major. The texture also changes as the melody fades away and the strings begin a long rising tremolo figure as related to the woodwinds' sixteenth-note pattern of the second theme. In some ways this key change acts as a transition back to the main Scherzo section. Stedman adds to Abraham's analysis by explaining that this return to the Scherzo acts as a recapitulation to the overall sonata form structure. This can be seen in measure 324, with the rising perfect fourth motive in the violins, the A-group is stated once more in a new form in the home key of E. This material is increasingly passed around the orchestra and developed into a staccato quarter-note arpeggiated figure that by measure 401 (letter L) completely takes over the texture, leaving the previous material behind. In measure 471 (letter O) the second half of Abraham's recapitulation begins with the duple subdivision of the B-group theme still in E major. Layton disagrees with Abraham's analysis saying that the recapitulation begins in measure 114 with the beginning of the first Scherzo section. He explains that \\"while not denying the Scherzo-like character of many episodes in the second half of the movement, there is no doubt that it does in fact correspond in broad outline to the recapitulation normal in sonata form.\\" He cites the return to the tonic in E in measure 159 (letter B) and the clear origin of the A-group material for both the Scherzo and Trio. Hepokoski takes an altogether different approach to the recapitulation. First, he structurally considers the Scherzo and recapitulation through the conclusion of the movement to all be part of the fourth and final rotation that he calls \\"Rotation 4, bars 106‚Äì586 ('Scherzo'; 'recapitulatory space')\\". When defining the location of the recapitulation within this rotation, he is unable to give specific measure numbers because it enters in a staggered manner. He shows how \\"the four defining 'recapitulatory' features, however ‚Äì theme, tempo, Scherzo character, and 'tonic colour' ‚Äì are set into place not simultaneously but one after another.\\" The return of the \\"theme\\" happens at measure 106 with the A-group materials heard in the brass with woodwind sixteenth-notes above. What he means by \\"tempo\\" and \\"Scherzo character\\" is the accelerando into the Allegro moderato section. Finally, he shows how \\"tonic colour\\" returns in measure 158 (letter B), putting into place all elements of the recapitulation. With the entry of the Trio section, the recapitulation is put on hold until the Scherzo returns. Coda Finally, sharp debate again surrounds the beginning of the coda: whether it starts in measure 507 at the Presto or measure 555 at the Pi√π Presto as analysed by Abraham and Hepokoski respectively. An equally plausible starting place is measure 497 (6 bars before Q) at the end of the final statement of the chordal duple-rhythm B-group theme (which begins at measure 487, letter P) with its syncopated trombone statement of the first four rising notes of the A-group (with which the work began) and the beginning of the E pedal which continues to the end of the movement. This entire ending section races in quarter-note arpeggios towards the conclusion, thus making it difficult to pinpoint the exact location of the beginning of the coda. Second movement This quiet movement is a set of variations on a theme of the flute heard at the beginning on the strings, played pizzicato with chirping woodwinds to create a cheerful feeling. : \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key g \\\\major \\\\time 3/2 \\\\tempo \\"Andante mosso, quasi allegretto\\" r4 a\\\\p-. **-. -. -. -.  -. -. r -. -. -.  -. -. } Third movement This movement begins with a rapid melody in the strings, played tremolando. After this is developed, a swaying, triple-time motif begins in the horns, which is said to have been inspired by the sound of swan-calls, as well as a specific instance when the composer witnessed sixteen of them taking flight at once.http://www.classical-music.com/article/six-best-pieces-music-inspired- swans Sir Donald Tovey compared this theme to Thor swinging his hammer. : \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef treble \\\\key ees \\\\major \\\\time 2/4 \\\\tempo \\"Allegro molto\\" 2--  \\\\--  \\\\--  \\\\--  \\\\--  \\\\--  \\\\--  \\\\--  \\\\--  \\\\--  \\\\--  \\\\--  \\\\-- } Over this, Sibelius has the flutes and strings play one of his most famous melodies. Both this and the motif are developed, until in the final section the motif returns majestically in the home key. The symphony ends with one of Sibelius's most original ideas (and one that is not in the original version): the six staggered chords of the final cadence, each separated by silence. : { ew PianoStaff << ew Staff \\\\relative c { \\\\clef treble \\\\key ees \\\\major \\\\time 3/2 r2 4 r r2  R1.  4 r r2 r  R1.  4 r r2 r  R1.  4 r r2 r  r r bes4 r  r2 ees,4 r r2 \\\\bar \\".\\" } ew Staff \\\\relative c' { \\\\clef bass \\\\key ees \\\\major \\\\time 3/2 r2 4 r r2  R1.  4 r r2 r  R1.  4 r r2 r  R1.  4 r r2 r  r r 4 r  r2 4 r r2 \\\\bar \\".\\" } >> } In popular culture The 'swan-call' motif has been appropriated in a number of pop songs, though some alleged borrowings are too fleeting or too approximate to be other than coincidental resemblances (e.g. \\"Popsicles and Icicles\\" by The Murmaids (1963); \\"On My Own\\" by Peach Union (1996), and the song \\"Stories\\" from Disney's Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas). Straightforward appropriation can be heard in the coda of Beach Baby by The First Class (1974); the main song of the movie The Small One (1978), \\"Since Yesterday\\" by Strawberry Switchblade (1984); \\"I Don't Believe in Miracles\\" by Sinitta (1988), and \\"Oh What A Life\\" by Play People (2008). The opening of the first movement is quoted in the opening to John Coltrane's \\"A Love Supreme\\". It is believed that Coltrane did not directly quote Sibelius, but instead quoted Leonard Bernstein's On the Town which, in turn, quoted from the symphony. It also appears as incidental music in the 2012 short subject Stella starring Ruth Jones. In the third episode of the third season of Mozart in the Jungle, Hailey imagines conducting this piece, with Rodrigo encouraging her.

They are performers for the entertainment company Yoshimoto Kogyo. They graduated from the Yoshimoto NSC Osaka 14th generation class. The unit's material is created by both Goto and Iwao.  Members  * Born June 18, 1974 in Higashiyodogawa-ku, Osaka. Plays the tsukkomi. His style of tsukkomi is well known for his use of metaphors and analogies. * Born December 19, 1975 in Higashisumiyoshi-ku, Osaka. Plays the boke. In Yoshimoto Kogyo's annual \\"Ugliest Yoshimoto Kogyo Entertainer\\" awards, he won first place three years in a row (2002-2004) and has since been ineligible for voting. Iwao himself does not consider himself to be unattractive but rather fashionable and trendy. Life and career Both Got≈ç and Iwao were in prior units before the formation of Football Hour. Got≈ç was in the comedy duo Got≈ç-Tenma (Later renamed to Electronic Gram) from 1994 to 1999 and Iwao was in the comedy duo Dress from 1994 to 1999. Both of them were graduates of the 14th generation class from Yoshimoto NSC Osaka.Official Profile on Yoshimoto Kogyo In April 1999, after both of their previous units were disbanded, the two partnered up and formed Got≈ç-Iwao, debuting in May of the same year. They changed their unit's name to Football Hour just 2 months after, in July. As classmates from Yoshimoto NSC, Got≈ç and Iwao mutually approved of each other's abilities in comedy, and thus chose to partner up with each other after Iwao's consultation with comedian Tomonori Jinnai and Got≈ç's consultation with Komoto from Jicho Kacho. Jinnai was supportive of the idea, but Komoto believed that the combination would not work as their individual characters are too strong. „Äé„Ç¥„ÉºJ!„ÄèÔºàMBS RadioÔºâFootball Hour episode In 2000, the duo received the best newcomer award at the ABC Owarai Newcomer Grand Prix.

It is senior to the rank of petty officer 1st-class and its equivalents, and junior to chief petty officer 1st-class and its equivalents. Its Army and Air Force equivalent is master warrant officer (MWO), and is part of the cadre of warrant officers. The French language form is premier ma√Ætre de 2me classe (pm 2). Insignia Royal Canadian Navy CPO2 The rank insignia of the CPO2 is a crown within a wreath of laurel, worn on both forearms of the Service Dress tunic and on slip-ons on both shoulders of other uniforms. They wear the same cap insignia as petty officers: a foul anchor surrounded by a wreath of laurel, surmounted by a crown. Forms of address CPO2s are generally initially addressed as \\"Chief Petty Officer Bloggins\\" or \\"Chief Bloggins\\", and thereafter as \\"Chief\\", although in correspondence the full rank or abbreviation is used before the member's name. The full appellation \\"Chief Petty Officer 2nd Class\\" in speech is generally used only when the \\"second class\\" distinction must be made, such as to distinguish between members with similar names but differing ranks, or on promotion parades. CPO2s are never addressed as \\"Sir\\" or \\"Ma'am\\", regardless of the protocol for their Army and Air Force equivalents; in Naval tradition, the titles \\"Sir\\" and \\"Ma'am\\" are reserved for officers. Appointments Due to the unified nature of the CF, it is not unheard-of for CPO2s -- especially those of the so-called \\"purple trades\\", such as logistics or military police -- to find themselves filling the appointment of Squadron or Company Sergeant- Major in what are otherwise considered \\"hard\\" army units (such as Service Battalions).

It is based on the Greek legend of Canace, the daughter of Aeolus, who was forced by her father to commit suicide for having fallen in love with her brother, Macar. The play was composed for Padua's literary academy, the Accademia degli Infiammati, and was printed at Firenze on 1546. The play was heavily modeled on Senecan tragedy. The work was highly polemical, and was performed only once. The public's reaction led Speroni to write an Apologia (1550), which he never finished. Still, the play circulated widely, and, with Giovanni Battista Giraldi's Orbecche, led to literary debates on tragedy and theatrical morals and decorum through to the next century. Elio Brancaforte's translation is the first translation of the play to English and it has just been published by the Centre for Renaissance and Reformation Studies, Toronto, 2013.

The University of Arizona (UA) owns a preserve and leases another as a research and education facility. The Steward Observatory maintains a small astronomical observatory with a telescope on the hill. Besides being a prominent landmark, Tumamoc Hill has a long and varied history, and is currently an important site for ecological and anthropological research as well as a refuge and a recreational option for the people of Tucson.

Official Designations and Management * National Environmental Study Site * Arizona State Scientific and Natural Educational Area * National Historic Landmark * National Register of Historic Places Human history Tumamoc, which is an O'odham word for \\"regal horned lizard\\", was a home to the ancient Hohokam people. It is the site of the earliest known trincheras village, consisting of 160 foundations of round stone structures, as well as large stone perimeter walls., University of Arizona Cultural Resources Policy and Management Plan, September 2008. Over 460 petroglyphs and a prehistoric garden beside the hill provide further evidence of Tumamoc‚Äôs importance to these people. For long after that time, 1,300 years ago, the site continued to provide resources to the Tohono O'odham, Akimel O'odham, and the Hopi. It has also been reported to be a burial site for the Apache and the O'odham. Captain Juan Mateo Manje, a Spanish military commander, wrote the following about Tumamoc Hill after seeing it on one of his expeditions with Father Kino between 1693 and 1701: Note that Manje refers to \\"former\\" wars, indicating that the fighting took place in prehistoric times (before the arrival of Europeans). Being that the O'odham are probably descendants of the Hohokam, it does not seem unreasonable to conclude that the Hohokam, who lived only a few centuries before Manje's expedition, did as their later relatives apparently did and used their trincheras to fall upon their enemies and kill them. European settlers prized the rock and clay found on the hill for building in the late 19th century, and early ecologists just after the turn of the 20th century selected it for the site of the Carnegie Institute's Desert Laboratory., United States Geological Survey and University of Arizona Desert Laboratory. ‚ÄúOngoing research on Tumamoc Hill\\". The hill continues to be a landmark and a sanctuary for the people of Tucson today. The road up Tumamoc Hill is a popular destination for walking and running. The entrance to the road up the hill is located across from St. Mary's Hospital on the south side of Anklam Road. It is open to pedestrians in the early mornings and evenings. The steep hill provides a strenuous workout, as well as citywide vistas. Lectures on the unique history and ecology are presented for the public at the site. History of ecological research National Historic Landmark. Frederick V. Colville, chief botanist of the Department of Agriculture, in 1903 convinced the Carnegie Institute of Washington to fund the creation of a Desert Laboratory near the small mining and ranching town of Tucson. The goal was to study desert adaptations of plants in hopes of increasing agricultural output of the desert. Among the pioneering researchers, who helped to shape the then-developing field of ecology in the United States, were William Cannon, Volney M. Spalding, Daniel T. MacDougal, Burton Livingston, Godfrey Sykes, and Forrest Shreve., Wall, Nancy. 1994. ‚ÄúFrom the hill of the horned toad.‚Äù Tucson Guide Quarterly: Fall, pp 88-93. This research continued until the 1940s, during which time the scientists there were instrumental in the development of the field of ecology in the United States. They began publishing a journal, Plant World, which later became the major journal Ecology. Due to financial difficulties from the Great Depression, as well as a disconnect between the Carnegie Institute‚Äôs mission of making use of the desert and the researchers‚Äô admiration of it, the Carnegie Institute turned the Desert Laboratory over to the Forest Service in 1940. They initially offered it to the University of Arizona for $1, but were turned down. Twenty years later, on July 20, 1960, after several easements and loss of research and records, the University purchased the reserve for considerably more. The long term observations and experiments on Tumamoc Hill‚Äôs vegetation have provided insights on saguaro boom and bust population dynamics, blue palo verde‚Äôs dependence on riparian areas, disease and other threats to desert tortoises, and the interactions of a community of small winter annuals and the insects and rodents that prey on their seeds.

Mediation platform  A billing mediation platform is a system used to convert data of certain datatypes to other datatypes, mainly for billing purposes. Billing mediation platforms are used mostly by telecom companies, which typically need to process usage detail records. In call scenarios, usage detail records are most often known as call detail records, and among broadband carriers they are often referred to as internet protocol detail records. Mediation also processes event detail records or EDRs that are usually generated by the charging systems or any other network elements. Hence, Mediation platforms can process all xDRs that are generated by any network element, be it CDR, EDR or UDR.  Data types  The usage and call detail record datatypes hold data such as NPX, NPA, call duration, peak time flag and call length. Data may be represented in ascii or binary formats. The billing mediation platform typically reads this data and converts it into common normalized format. Billing systems and all other downstream systems, in turn, converts this data to component [its own] understandable format.  Naming  Billing mediation platforms get their name from their behavior: they \\"mediate\\" data between systems. In a typical telephone company scenario, the systems providing data to the mediation platform are network elements, such as telephone switches, and the systems receiving data from the mediation platform perform accounting, auditing, archiving, or bill-generation functions. The mediation system collects, collates and prepares data for consumption by the downstream systems, which often accept data only in a limited set of formats.  Functionality  Typically a mediation platform is used for the following tasks: * Collection and validation of call detail records * Filtering out of non billing-relevant call detail records * Collating * Correlation of different input sources call detail records * Aggregation of partial call detail records related to the same call * Format change and call detail record normalization * Business transformation of data In a telecom billing scenario, mediation is the first step after receiving a call detail record. The mediated call detail record files are forwarded to a rating engine, which calculates the charge associated with the call detail records. In today's world, Rating Engines are becoming more necessary for the telecom billing system to be able to meet the growing variant customer needs for different services. Despite the name, not all of the data transferred via billing mediation platforms is actually used for billing purposes. For instance, the mediation software might generate traffic volume statistics based on the number and origin of the records it processes. Those statistics could then be used for capacity planning, as part of a network monitoring procedure, or for any other business intelligence applications. At core, mediation involves data transfer between various systems with or without modification of data starting from Network elements to any OSS/BSS systems. Sophisticated billing mediation software serves end to end functionality for telecom operators. Mediation software performs various operations from data collection to downstream distribution to modules like retail billing, roaming, interconnect settlement, business intelligence, fraud detection and revenue assurance. Following list provides insight on mediation software activities * Collection and archiving * Decoding/Encoding * Normalization (common format) * Filtering * Conversion * Validation * Record enrichment (using complex reference data) * Duplicate record detection * Aggregation or Correlation * Buffering * Cloning * Sorting * Downstream format mapping * Header and trailer generation * Downstream distribution * Error messaging and alarms * Auditing and reports * Reconciliation * Reference data configuration * Provisioning services for the subscription Complementary to billing mediation functions, comprehensive mediation platforms also provide functionality dedicated to Service Provisioning (the two areas frequently intermix as services configured and used by the end customer result in usage data records generation in the network). Mediating between the systems is not the only job that Mediation Platform can do. Actually this can be used as a provisioning agent. The basic provisioning commands can be configured within the mediation system and whenever we get a request for the system which does the provisioning, the request can be converted into a file, in which mediation can append the service provisioning commands and send it to the Home Location Register (HLR) for activating any request. This of course, load dependent but can come very handy when there is a crisis in the other system.  Supported systems  Telecom operators offer Voice, video, data, fax and internet services to subscribers and partners on various product lines. Mediation products are tuned to provide solutions for complex business challenges. The call data is produced by network devices in the form of call detail record). Mediation platforms for telecom practice support various systems: * Retail Billing * Wholesale Billing - National and International * Network Traffic Management Tools * Data Warehousing Systems * Business Intelligence / Big Data Systems * Reconciliation Systems * Fraud Management Systems * Provisioning feed to sub- systems * RA - Revenue Assurance Systems * ICT - Information and Communication Technology Systems * Assurance Insight Synap System References Category:Telecommunications economics ","title":"Telecommunications mediation"},{"id":"3786370","text":"Shahidul Alam (born 1955) is a Bangladeshi photojournalist, teacher and social activist.

In 2014 he was awarded the Shilpakala Padak by the President of Bangladesh and in 2018 the Humanitarian Award from the Lucie Awards. On 5 August 2018, Alam was arrested and detained shortly after giving an interview to Al Jazeera and posting live videos on Facebook that criticized the government's violent response to the 2018 Bangladesh road safety protests. Many international humanitarian organisations and news media called for his release without charge. He was granted bail on 20 November 2018. He was one of the persons of the year selected by Time Magazine in 2018. Early life and education=Childhood Alam was born in Dhaka, East Pakistan (modern-day Bangladesh) in 1955. He grew up at Dhanmodi residential area of the same city. He was one of three siblings born to middle-class parents. His father was a scientist and his mother, a child psychologist. As a boy Alam was, easy to spot. In his childhood, he used to float through Dhaka's congested arteries atop his slight fold-up bicycle.. He studied at the boarding school Jhenidah Cadet College. University studies Alam took his undergraduate degree at University of Liverpool Alam took his undergraduate education in the University of Liverpool. During his time in Liverpool he made a habit of walking in the streets in his lungi, a traditional South Asian garment. In his college year he was introduced to activism through his involvement with the Socialist Workers Party. He graduated from the university in 1976 by earning his BSc in Biochemistry and Genetics. He relocated to London for his Doctor of Philosophy study at Bedford College, University of London. Alam started to take an interest in photograph during his time in London. At Bedford, he also worked as a research chemist to invent alternative printing processes for photographs.Shahidul Alam: His Journey as a Witness The Daily Star In 1983, he won the Harvey Harris Trophy from London Arts Council for a photograph that he took. This boosted his confidence in pursuing a career in photography. At the same year, he received his D.Phil in Organic Chemistry. Career BOBs awards. In 1989, he set up Drik Picture Library and in 1998, Pathshala South Asian Institute of Photography (later Pathshala South Asian Media Institute), in Dhaka. Pathshala \\"has trained hundreds of photographers\\". He started the Chobi Mela International Photography Festival in 1999 and remains a director. Alam has been a judge of the World Press Photo competition on four occasions, and was the first Asian chair of its judging panel. He was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal Photographic Society in 2001. He was a member of the jury board of The BOBs' award. \\"His photographs have been published in almost every major western media outlet, including the New York Times, Time magazine and National Geographic\\". Alam set up the South Asian Media Academy. He has covered news events including natural disasters, governmental upheavals, the deaths of garment factory workers, human rights abuses, Bangladeshi government and military's repression and the \\"disappearances\\" of political opponents. His 2010 exhibition on extrajudicial killings named as Crossfire curated by Peruvian curator Jorge Villacorta has been widely acclaimed, but was closed down by the police leading to nationwide protests. The police barricade was removed after Drik's lawyers served legal notice on the government. The court's response and subsequent events enabled Drik to open the exhibition for public viewing on 31 March. In 2010, he co-curated the exhibition Where Three Dreams Cross at Whitechapel Gallery in London. In 2012, he participated in the inaugural Kochi-Muziris Biennale held in Kerala, India.

Biography He was born at Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia, the son of Major-General Henry Darling and nephew of General Sir Ralph Darling. He was educated at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and served in the garrisons of Barbados, the Windward Islands, and Jamaica, with the 57th Foot. He went to New South Wales in 1827 with this regiment, and served as assistant private secretary to the Governor of New South Wales, to his uncle Ralph Darling. He served in the British West Indies from 1833 until he retired from the army in 1841 and settled in Jamaica. He started his colonial service while in Jamaica, during which time he often clashed with leaders of the free people of color who were elected to the island's Assembly, such as Robert Osborn (Jamaica). He became Lieutenant-Governor of St. Lucia in 1847, and he became Lieutenant-Governor of the Cape Colony in South Africa in 1851. A town in South Africa, on the West Coast of the country was named after Darling. He became Governor of Newfoundland in 1855. Darling supported the British suggestions granting the French more fishing rights in waters of Newfoundland between Cape St. John and Cape Ray to the total disagreement of the Newfoundland government which ultimately led to the end of his term in office. Darling became governor and captain-chief of Jamaica in 1857 then governor of Victoria, Australia from 1863 to 1866. His first marriage was on 2 May 1835 to Anne Wilhelmina Dalzell (18 July 1813 ‚Äì 16 October 1837). They had a son who died in infancy. Anne came from a wealthy family, who owned a plantation in Barbados. Through Anne's will, Darling would have received some money, although she died before her mother who had owned the slaves. He was then married, at Christ Church, Barbados, on 14 December 1839 to Mary Ann Nurse (who died of yellow fever in St Lucia on 6 November 1848). His third marriage, at Ilfracombe, North Devon, was on 10 December 1851 to Elizabeth Isabella Caroline Salter ( 1820 ‚Äì 10 December 1900).

Despite popular belief, the G5 as such was not meant to race in international Formula One racing. The G5 was a successor of Moskvitch G4, and components of two G4M's were used to construct both G5 cars. Main difference was a new construction layout, with a new five-gear gearbox mounted at the rear, behind an engine and a rear axle. Also a rear suspension was new one. The G5 was also the first Russian car with disk brakes on all wheels. The car debuted in Soviet Formula One racing on September 1968. The engine was an uprated 1478 cc inline-4 engine from the Moskvitch 412, taken from the G4M and developing first . During 1969 season the engine was replaced with Moskvitch 412-2V, fitted with a new DOHC head and two twin Weber 40DCO carburetors. This engine produced at 5800 rpm. In 1970 the engine was modified to develop . Displacement was increased to 1840 cc in 1972 (now producing .

However, in 1965 a government funding was cut, and Moskvitch factory alone could not afford a program, so it was abandoned in 1967. Also, by that year more powerful 3000 cc engines were introduced to Formula One. Only the new gearbox, with four upper gears synchronised, was adapted for G5 cars.

It is equivalent to a chief warrant officer (CWO) in the Canadian Army and Royal Canadian Air Force. It is immediately senior to the rank of chief petty officer 2nd-class and its equivalents, master warrant officer; it is part of the cadre of warrant officers. The French language form of the rank is premier ma√Ætre de 1re classe (pm 1). Insignia The rank insignia of the CPO1 is the Coat of Arms of Canada, worn on both forearms of the Service Dress tunic and on slip-ons on both shoulders of other uniforms. Unlike other Chiefs and Petty Officers, CPO1s wear the cap insignia of Naval officers, although the brim of the peak cap remains plain, the same as other Naval NCMs. Forms of address CPO1s are generally initially addressed as \\"Chief Petty Officer Bloggins\\" or \\"Chief Bloggins\\", and thereafter as \\"Chief\\", although in correspondence the full rank or abbreviation is used before the member's name. The Coxswain of a Royal Canadian Navy ship will be answered as \\"Coxswain\\" (e.g. \\"yes Coxswain\\" or \\"no Coxswain\\") The full appellation \\"Chief Petty Officer 1st Class\\" in speech is generally used only when the \\"first class\\" distinction must be made, such as to distinguish between members with similar names but differing ranks, or on promotion parades. CPO1s are never addressed as \\"Sir\\" or \\"Ma'am\\", regardless of the protocol for their Army and Air Force equivalents; in Naval tradition, the titles \\"Sir\\" and \\"Ma'am\\" are reserved for officers. Appointments One of the normal appointments of a CPO1 is that of coxswain, the senior NCM on a ship; it is roughly analogous to an Army Regimental Sergeant-Major (RSM).

History Founded in 1969 by the Archdiocese of Toronto, it opened its doors in September, 1965. Initially under the control of the Society of Mary (the Marianists), the school was named for the Society's founder, Father William Joseph Chaminade. The mandate of the school was to prepare young men for post-secondary education in a traditional Catholic secondary school environment. The school's motto \\"Fortes in fide\\" emphasizes the importance of the virtue of faith in the life of the Catholic school. In 1967, Chaminade began a partnership with the Metropolitan Separate School Board (now Toronto Catholic District School Board). In this partnership, the Board conducted the first two years of secondary school, and the Archdiocese conducted the remaining years. In September 1972, the Irish Christian Brothers took over administration of the school, until their departure in June 1988. The school is currently fully operated by the MSSB after the funding was expanded and the identity of the religious order for that school is preserved. The school won a Green Toronto award in 2007 for its pioneering efforts in establishing the Adopt a Stream project that became a citywide model for waterway cleanup.John Goddard, \\"A Toronto river runs through them: Garbage patrol is only part of school's care and cleaning of Humber tributary\\", Toronto Star, May 2, 2007. In 2008, students circulated a petition which resulted in the Province of Ontario outlawing smoking in automobiles when children are passengers. Chaminade is also known for its athletic achievements with Tevaun Smith and James Bodanis currently playing college football in the United States. The school is also home to several chess masters such as Vietnamese child prodigies Ho√†ng Nguy√™n and Henry Vu. Nadia Pasquini, a veteran teacher at Chaminade, received the Prime Minister's Award for Teaching Excellence for the 2016-2017 school year. Pasquini's feats include fundraising over $24,000 for the Free the Children organization as well as partnering with the Working Against Violence Everyday group to raise awareness about screen addiction.Government of Canada, \\"Prime Minister's Awards for Teaching Excellence Recipients\\", Government of Canada, May 3, 2017.

Biography  Parviz Natel Khanlari graduated from Tehran University in 1943 with a doctorate degree in Persian literature, and began his academic career in the faculty of arts and letters. He also studied linguistics at Paris University for two years. From then on, Khanlari founded a new course named history of Persian language in Tehran University. Khanlari's contributions fall into several categories. Apart from his academic career which continued until the 1979 revolution, he held numerous administrative positions in the Iran in the 1960s through the late 1970s. Early in his career, he was the Governor of Azerbaijan Province. Later on, he served first as the Deputy Prime Minister and later as the Minister of Education of Iran. He served as the representative of Mazandaran in four sessions of the Iranian Parliament. He was also the founder of the Iranian Culture Foundation (Bonyad-e Farhang-e Iran). His efforts were instrumental in the establishment and operation of the Iran Academy of Arts and Literature of Iran, the Franklin Institute, and other cultural and educational institutions. Parviz Natel Khanlari was founder and editor of Sokhan magazine, a leading literary journal with wide circulation among Iraninan intellectuals and literary scholars from the early 1940s to 1978. According to Iraj Bashiri, Khanlari as a writer, is distinguished for the simplicity of his style. He did not follow the traditionalists nor did he advocate the new. Indeed, his approach accommodated the entire spectrum of creativity and expression in Persian literature. Bashiri's verse translation of Khanlari's Oghab (eagle) is provided below:  The Eagle  :: By :: Parviz Natel Khanlari :: Translated by :: Iraj Bashiri :: Copyright, Bashiri 2000 :: \\"It is related that the crow lives three hundred :: years and more...while the eagle's life span is :: but thirty years. \\" From Khavas al-Haivan :: Sadness filled the eagle's soul and heart, :: When his youthful days began to depart. :: The end was approaching fast, he saw, :: With only sunsets remaining to draw. :: Leaving this world full of desire, :: To another world he must retire. :: The incurable demanded quick cure, :: A medicine at once fresh and pure. :: Early one morn he took to flight, :: To end, for good, the mortals' plight. :: Alarmed, the flock avoiding capture, :: Ran here and yon, devoid of rapture. :: Fearful of the enemy, the shepherd, :: Sought safety for the lamb and the herd, :: Among the brush, the partridge hid, :: Into a deep hole, the snake slid. :: Stopped in his track the deer, then ran, :: Leaving a line of dust, thin and tan. :: The hunter though, elsewhere bound, :: Allowed the game to roam the ground. :: Mortals are destined to one day perish, :: Sweetness of life to no longer cherish. :: A black crow, a filthy, ill-formed pest, :: On that vast plane had made his nest. :: A survivor of kids, the rocks they throw, :: He lived the monotonous life of a crow. :: Beyond reckoning his number of years, :: Dead matter and carrion his daily fares. :: Spotting the crow, down flew the mighty king, :: His complaint to the pesky bird to bring. :: \\"Much maligned fellow, respectfully I seek, :: Your wise counsel, do not be meek. :: A solution true if offered for my pain, :: My regal reach would determine your gain. \\" :: \\"We are but slaves, \\" said the crow, \\"of old, :: To carry your orders, with honors untold. :: Ready at your command to play my role, :: Sacrifice for you, my self, body, and soul. :: Life sacrificed for you, I have been taught. :: Is all there is, no more exists to be sought. \\" :: Outwardly this but, within he thought, :: 'In the eagle's claws, I must not be caught. :: Need has made the mighty meek and tame, :: Am I not to him but a feckless game? :: If suddenly riled or slightly scuffed, :: Like a candle, my life will be snuffed. :: Ill- founded friendship begets ill-founded love, :: Ill-placed discretion turns me into a dove.

The simplest water level is a section of clear tubing, partially filled with water. Water is easily procured for use, and easily discarded after use. The ends are held vertical, and the rest of the tubing lies on the ground or floor. The water level at each end of the tube will be at the same elevation, whether the two ends are adjacent or far apart. Water levels have been used for many years. The water level is lower-tech than the laser level, but it can be more accurate over long distances, and works without a sightline, such as around corners. To avoid error, all of the water should be at the same temperature. Other sources of error include difficulty reading due to meniscus. If the water level is used often, dye can be added to the water to make it easier to see. If the water level is used outdoors in winter, antifreeze can be added to the water. Automotive window washer fluid can also be used for antifreeze and increased visibility. Additionally it inhibits the formation of error-causing bubbles. A surfactant (surface active agent), such as hand-dishwashing liquid detergent, can be added to the water to significantly lower the surface tension of the water. This liquid solution will flow more easily and more rapidly in the tube than plain water, so operation of the device will be more precise, repeatable, and responsive ‚Äì particularly when using a small-diameter tube. Also, this liquid solution can be emptied from a small-diameter tube more easily than plain water.

He won numerous awards and citations, including three National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association's Sportscaster of the Year awards for New York from 1964‚Äì66. Considered a New York institution in sports reporting, Mazer was inducted into the hall of fame for the Buffalo Broadcasters Association (1999), Buffalo Baseball (2000) and the National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame and Museum (1997). He is also recognized as the host of the first sports talk radio show in history that launched in March 1964 on WNBC (AM). Mazer earned the nickname \\"The A-Maz-In\\" for his deep knowledge of sports trivia. This was made evident while hosting his WNBC radio show in the 1960s. Based on this, he wrote several sports trivia books, including Bill Mazer's Amazin' Baseball Book: 150 Years of Baseball Tales & Trivia published by Zebra Books in 1990. Background Mazer's family left Kiev, emigrating before his first birthday. He grew up in Brooklyn, New York. A graduate of Yeshiva University High School for Boys, he received a BA at University of Michigan for premed before being drafted. During World War II, he served the majority of his time in the Armed Forces-Air Force Transport Command in the Pacific theatre. After returning home, he married Dora Sudarsky (\\"Dutch\\"), his pre-war sweetheart. They had three children. Their marriage lasted 50 years until Sudarsky's death from cancer on April 28, 1996. The New York Knickerbockers observed a moment of silence during their May 1, 1996 Playoff game. Mazer never remarried. Career=Early work Mazer's broadcasting career began in 1942, broadcasting in Grand Rapids, Michigan before joining the United States Military that same year. His career as a sportscaster began in Buffalo, New York in 1947, where he signed on as a sportscaster on WKBW. In 1947, he was also the commercial announcer on the CBS William L. Shirer Newscast, as well as the commercial announcer for the soap opera, When a Girl Marries. By 1948, he had also become the sports director for WGR radio and served as principal sports anchor for WGR-TV from the time that station signed on in 1954 through the early 1960s. Mazer dominated the airwaves in Buffalo, broadcasting the hockey and baseball Buffalo Bisons, the All-American Football Conference Buffalo Bills and Little 3 Basketball. With years of play-by-play and sports commentary in Buffalo under his belt, Mazer arrived in New York City in 1964 when WNBC (AM) went to its first all-talk format. His show was one of the pioneer examples of the modern sports talk show in America. After filling in for Hugh Downs on the NBC game show Concentration, he was given his own show, Reach for the Stars, in January 1967, but the show was quickly cancelled. Mazer also filled in for segments of the long-running NBC Radio series Monitor, even hosting on occasion.http://monitorbeacon.net/nbc- monitor/monitors-history/ National sportscasting and announcing Mazer served as a color analyst and intermission host, working alongside Dan Kelly on CBS' National Hockey League coverage from the late sixties until the early seventies, broadcasting the Stanley Cup playoffs a few times. Among the memorable games he covered was Game #4 of the 1970 Stanley Cup finals, famously won by the Boston Bruins on Bobby Orr's iconic overtime goal on May 10, 1970. Golf was another Mazer specialty on NBC, including the U.S. Open and Bing Crosby tournaments in the mid-1960s. ABC used Mazer for its regional New York football lineup in the late 1960s. Mazer also did sideline reporting for CBS coverage of the NFL in the late 1960s. During the 1960s and 1970s, Mazer did much voice-over commercial work, from L&M; Cigarettes, Kodak, Ford automobiles to Trident chewing gum, among many others. WNEW-TV Mazer was a sportcaster at New York's WNEW/WNYW-TV (Metromedia/Fox Channel 5) for twenty years, ending in the early 1990s. He also co-hosted the program Sports Extra, which originally teamed him up with Lee Leonard and then later with Brian Madden (1976‚Äì78), respectively. Sports Extra is also considered to have been the first \\"sports wrap-up\\" show of its kind. While doing sports for The 10 O'Clock News on WNEW in the late 1970s and '80s, he held a daily contest where a viewer would send in a question to \\"stump\\" Bill and would win a prize if he or she did. Usually the submitted question was asked by anchorman John Roland. WFAN (1988-1991; 2007) and WEVD (1992-2001) Mazer hosted a WFAN sports show from Mickey Mantle's restaurant from 1988 to 1991, and returned to the station on June 30, 2007 to host an hour-long show from 10‚Äì11 AM during the station's 20th anniversary celebration and reunion weekend. He was also a morning talk show host on WEVD, where he expanded to a comprehensive liberal talk format from 1992 to 2001. The show ended when WEVD was optioned to ABC's ESPN division and became sports station WEPN. He appeared on the cable TV show The Leon Charney Report, as well as minor parts in movies such as Eyewitness, Raging Bull and appearing in episodes of ESPN SportsCentury as an expert on sport figures including Gordie Howe, Lawrence Taylor and Mickey Mantle. WVOX-AM (2001 - 2009) Following his departure from WEVD in 2001, Mazer launched an afternoon interview program on WVOX in New Rochelle, New York from 3‚Äì6 PM EST with his son, Arnie Mazer, serving as producer. His last show on WVOX was aired August 3, 2009, ending his tenure at the station after nearly eight years. Death (2013) Mazer's death was reported on October 23, 2013 at the age of 92. He died at a hospital in Danbury, Connecticut.

A government is gridlocked when the ratio between bills passed and the agenda of the legislature decreases. Laws may be considered as the supply and the legislative agenda as demand. Gridlock can occur when two legislative houses, or the executive branch and the legislature are controlled by different political parties, or otherwise cannot agree. United States U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the Gridlock caused by the separation of powers and checks and balances of the U.S. Government In United States politics, gridlock frequently refers to occasions when the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate are controlled by different parties, or by a different party than the party of the President. Gridlock may also occur within the Senate, when no party has a filibuster-proof majority. \\"Political Gridlock\\" by author Ned Witting identifies many of the causes of gridlock in the United States and outlines ways to get government working again. Law professors such as Sanford Levinson and Adrian Vermeule, as well as political commentators such as Matthew Yglesias and Debbie Parks, have criticized the U.S. Constitution and Senate voting rules for enabling situations of legislative gridlock. Along these lines, David Brady, a professor of Political Science at Stanford University, and Craig Volden, a professor of Public Policy and Politics at the University of Virginia, explain gridlock by pointing to two interrelated factors: first, \\"the preferences of members of Congress regarding particular policies\\" and second, \\"supermajority institutions - the Senate filibuster and the presidential veto\\". As a result, they argue, gridlock is not determined by party control of the government, but rather by an interplay between the existing policy and the spectrum of individual preferences held by congressional representatives. They maintain, in essence, that \\"the policy preferences of Members of Congress at or near the median are among the crucial determinants of policy outcomes.\\" Marcus Ethridge, an emeritus professor of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee, argues in a 2011 policy analysis published by the libertarian Cato Institute that the US Constitution was designed to foster gridlock in order to increase \\"the likelihood that policies will reflect broad, unorganized interests instead of the interests of narrow, organized groups.\\" Ethridge presented an extended version of his analysis in \\"The Case for Gridlock: Democracy, Organized Power, and the Legal Foundations of American Government\\" (2010), which argues that \\"progressive reformers sought to shift the power to shape policy from the legislative branch to the executive bureaucracy\\" in an attempt to limit the power of special interests, but that this strategy backfired because of \\"the ability of interest groups to infiltrate the bureaucracy and promote their interests, often in ways diametrically opposed to the reformers' intentions\\" and \\"the capacity of Congress to overcome the influence of groups and generate policy change.\\" In order to counter this, Ethridge suggests a \\"return to the 'constitutional principle' of gridlock, in which special interests must compete in a legislative forum\\". Researchers such as David R. Jones blame ‚Äòhigher party polarization increase[s] the likelihood of encountering gridlock‚Äô. When looking at figures of polarisation within U.S. politics ‚Äòpartisan antipathy is deeper and more extensive ‚Äì than at any point in the last two decades‚Äô with 92% of Republicans being to the right of the median Democrat, and 94% of Democrats aligning to the left of the median Republican voter. This modern polarisation paired with a system designed to operate on Burkean representation, not today's party-line voting, leads us to seemingly inevitable gridlock. Westminster systems In parliamentary systems based on the Westminster system, parliamentary deadlocks may arise when an election results in neither or none of the major political parties having the numbers in the lower house (the house where the government is formed) to form a government, or when the votes in a lower house of parliament are so close that a government cannot be sure of getting its legislation passed through the house, or when another party (usually referred to as the opposition party) controls a majority of votes in the upper house. (Example, Two friends in a group of two, both have different ideas but neither one wants to do the others idea, that is what you could call political deadlock) A recent innovation has been to remove the power of the upper house to block supply, as well as some other bills. The Australian Constitution provides a mechanism for breaking a deadlock between the two houses of Parliament, by means of a double dissolution and, if the deadlock is still not resolved, by a joint sitting of both houses of parliament.Section 57 of the Australian Constitution.

The Wisconsin State Patrol enforces traffic and criminal laws, oversees the motor carrier safety and weight facilities (SWEFs), inspects and regulates motor carriers, school buses and ambulances, and assists local law enforcement agencies with traffic safety, civil disturbances and disasters (natural and man-made). History Prior to 1939, some statewide enforcement efforts through were made through other government departments. For example, in 1917, the Dairy and Food Department and the Oil Inspection Department were legally authorized to conduct investigations of the licensing and vehicle sale laws. Also, in 1931, the State Highway Administration had personnel dedicated to checking truck traffic and weights. On September 1, 1939, the Wisconsin legislature passed a statute creating the Motor Vehicle Department, which consisted of three divisions. The new Enforcement Division began with 46 \\"inspectors\\" -comprised from five smaller agencies within other departments, to enforce the state motor vehicle code and regulate motor carriers. There were 33 Public Service Commission Transportation Inspectors, 8 Inspection Bureau inspectors and 5 Secretary of State Investigators. Inspectors were paid $180 per month. The new traffic officers were supplied a siren, flashing red lights, police license plates and an official shield for the sides of their personal cars. The state also paid $30.00 a month for gasoline, oil and grease. State Patrol radio first went on the air February 1, 1943, operating station WIZR on a frequency of 31.5 megahertz. It was able to communicate with the patrol's mobile units, as well as with most of the municipal and county law enforcement short-wave stations. The Wisconsin State Patrol (WSP) was established the purpose of providing law enforcement services in a rapidly changing transportation environment. Along with that effort, it was recognized from its inception that the WSP would stand ready to provide public safety assistance to local, county and tribal units of government as well as our partner agencies at the state and federal levels. Through the years many changes have been made, but the patrol's goal has always been and will continue to be assisting the motoring public and making Wisconsin's highways safe. In 1970, the statutory limit for the number of troopers in the state was increase from 375 to 400 (WI ss. 110.07). The State Patrol currently operates 16 safety and weight enforcement facilities throughout Wisconsin. The Wisconsin State Patrol Academy at Fort McCoy (Tomah, WI) provides diverse law enforcement training programs for federal, state and local law enforcement officers. Mission As stated on its website, the State Patrol provides traffic safety and enforcement services for Wisconsin. Like all highway patrol and state patrol agencies, its primary mission is to enforce the provisions of the Wisconsin Motor Vehicle laws and other laws to prevent crime. State troopers and inspectors have statewide jurisdiction for traffic and criminal enforcement. These are the services provided statewide by the agency: * Traffic law enforcement through freeway patrols and Major Highways * Accident scene reconstruction and crime scene mapping for investigations * Motor carrier safety inspections * Commercial vehicle size and weight enforcement * Inspections of school buses, ambulances, motor coaches, and salvage vehicles * Evaluation and maintenance of breath- alcohol testing equipment; also provides training to some county and local law enforcement agencies in using such equipment * Assistance to county and local law enforcement agencies when requested upon * Law enforcement training at the Wisconsin State Patrol Academy * Traffic safety programs Troopers typically patrol an assigned geographic area along key travel corridors like interstates and other multi-lane freeways. Their primary duties are to ensure safe traffic movement, respond to crashes or other incidents, assist stranded motorists and local law enforcement agencies. Inspectors, along with traffic enforcement duties, receive additional training regarding federal motor carrier rules that impact commercial motor vehicles and CMV drivers. Inspectors often work out of one of the State Patrol‚Äôs 13 Safety and Weight Enforcement Facilities (SWEFs) across the state. SWEFs at key state border locations incorporate modern technologies such as weigh-in-motion devices and indoor inspection bays that enhance public safety and the efficient movement of commerce. The State Patrol maintains and manages the facilities of the Mobile Data Communications Network (MDCN), a system that supports remote access to information available from the United States Department of Justice. The service is provided free of charge to allied criminal justice agencies in Wisconsin.Purpose of the Mobile Data Communication Network http://www.dot.wisconsin.gov/statepatrol/services/communications.htm/ Training A training academy was established in 1955 to offer formal education instructions in partnership with the Northwestern University Traffic Institute. Since 1957, the agency has been training its recruits with its own staff. The Wisconsin State Patrol Academy, in Fort McCoy, sits on and is used to train State Patrol recruits but also some county and local law enforcement agencies personnel on the latest techniques in traffic law enforcement. Training for recruits currently lasts 26 weeks in a paramilitary setting. Fort McCoy itself is a military installation run by the United States Army. Prior to joining the academy, recruits must pass several phases during initial testing. Those phases include a physical agility test, a background investigation, an interview, and a psychological/medical exams.Hiring process with the Wisconsin State Patrol https://wsp.wi.gov/Pages/Minimum- Requirements.aspx Today not only State Patrol officers, but county and municipal law enforcement officers are being trained in the latest techniques of traffic law enforcement at the patrol's training academy facilities at Fort McCoy. The State Patrol today The State Patrol became part of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation in the 1960s, and was designated a DOT division in 1977. In 2003, the Bureau of Transportation Safety was incorporated into the State Patrol. In 2005 the State Patrol reorganized and went from seven districts to five regions. . #Southwest Region DeForest and Tomah Posts #Southeast Region Waukesha Post #Northeast Region Fond du Lac Post #North Central Region Wausau Post #Northwest Region Eau Claire and Spooner Posts The central office is located within the Hill Farms State Office Building in (Madison) The Bureau of Field Operations (BFO) provides traffic law enforcement services and promotes highway safety in Wisconsin. This is primarily accomplished by troopers, inspectors, and law enforcement dispatchers located in Wisconsin State Patrol Posts and Safety and Weight Enforcement Facilities statewide. The Motor Carrier Enforcement section oversees motor carrier safety and weight facilities (SWEFs), and inspects and regulates motor carriers, school buses and ambulances. The bureau also enforces criminal and traffic laws, conducts criminal highway interdiction programs, and helps local law enforcement agencies with traffic safety, civil disturbances and disasters (natural and man-made).

Since the mid-2000s troopers have been armed with the Glock 22 .40 S&W; pistol as standard issue sidearm which replaced the Ruger P-series 9mm pistols. In the late 1980s the WSP chose the Ruger P-85 which they carried until the early 1990s when they chose the newer Ruger P-89 which was replaced by the Glocks. Prior to the semi-automatic pistols the patrol carried the Smith & Wesson Model 66 service revolvers.

He lived in Manhattan in New York City, dividing his time between his residences in Tel Aviv and Boca Raton, Florida. In March 2012, Forbes listed Charney as No. 353 among the wealthiest Americans. He was a graduate of Yeshiva University where he participated in demonstrations to free Soviet Jewry, and Brooklyn Law School. Charney was best known as a New York real estate baron, but his role as one of the backdoor players integral to sealing the Camp David Peace Treaty between the State of Israel and Egypt later emerged. In 1979, Charney played an important role as the unofficial adviser to former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, most well known for his behind- the-scenes role in the Camp David Accords which created the first comprehensive peace between Israel and Egypt in 1978 and 1979. In 2008, some thirty years later, Charney, a major real estate owner in New York's Times Square, appeared for the first time on the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans, debuting at No. 321. The 2009 list2009 Forbes 400 List ‚Äì the first to reflect the world financial crisis, indicated Charney's net worth had fallen in the previous year, although his rank had jumped to No. 296, up 35 notches, indicating that while he lost wealth, he lost less than other fellow billionaires. For 2010, Charney ranked No. 308 on the Forbes 400. Early life Leon Harris Charney was born to a Jewish family in Bayonne, New Jersey, to Morris, a sewing supplies salesman who died at a young age when his son was young, and Sara Charney. He grew up poor. He attended Jewish day schools, worked as a counselor at Camp Winsokee, graduated from Yeshiva University in 1960, and from Brooklyn Law School in 1964. He paid for his education in part by singing in synagogues, and by selling sewing machines door-to-door. Career He became a member of the bar in 1965, and with $200 in the bank started his own law firm representing sports and show-business personalities, including Jackie Mason and Sammy Davis Jr. As a young attorney, he was also a fierce advocate for the passage of the Good Samaritan Law after witnessing a man die in public when doctors refused to intervene out of fear of being sued. Charney became counsel and adviser at age 36 to U.S. Senator Vance Hartke of Indiana, and was his special counsel for six years. Through Hartke, Charney became more involved in international politics and diplomacy. He became close to Golda Meir, Prime Minister of Israel, with whom Charney worked on Israel's initiative to free Soviet Jews and help them emigrate to Israel. That effort saw the emigration of 1,000 Jews from Minsk in the Soviet Union to Israel. Later, United States President Jimmy Carter asked Charney to help advise him during the Camp David Accords. Charney refers to his efforts as using \\"back door channels\\", and he advised President Jimmy Carter from 1977-81. In a forward for one of Charney's books, Carter referred to Charney as \\"the unsung hero of the Camp David Peace Treaty.\\" In 1986 Charney went to Tunisia to meet with Yasser Arafat in the hope of a possible peaceful resolution of the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. The Back Door Channel In 2009, Charney was a featured interviewee in a Harry Hunkele documentary film starring former U.S. President Jimmy Carter entitled Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace which is opening in the heart of the Arab world in Abu Dhabi in October 2010 at the Abu Dhabi Film Festival, also known as the Middle East International Film Festival. The film was the source of much buzz in the diplomatic sphere, as it is rumored that many never before revealed aspects of the original peace process were unveiled, some of which paint a less than rosy picture of American diplomatic efforts at the time. It has only been verified that the movie has been shown once, in Monte Carlo, due to a special request made by Albert II, Prince of Monaco, the President of the Festival, to Arick Wierson, the film's executive producer. The film itself was a source of some controversy in New York political circles. The film deals with the 1979 Peace Treaty between Israel and Egypt and the real-life behind-the scenes drama that led to the historic peace treaty. The film's title is actually an opaque reference to Charney himself, considered by many to be the \\"back door channel\\" that enabled the Camp David peace to materialize. The landmark agreement was the first between the Jewish State and any Arab country. In addition to Carter and Charney, the film features former Secretary-General of the U.N. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Dr. Henry Kissinger, the former U.S. Secretary of State, CNN's Wolf Blitzer, and Senior Adviser to King Mohammed VI of Morocco, Andr√© Azoulay and many other international dignitaries who played roles both major and minor in the Israeli-Egyptian peace. The film was also screened at the 2012 Jerusalem Film Festival and the 2012 Atlanta Jewish Film Festival. In 2014, Charney received an Emmy Award for the television version of the documentary. The Leon Charney Report Charney hosted a national weekly TV talk show Leon Charney Report which dealt with local New York politics, foreign affairs and the Middle East, social issues and popular culture. Over its 25 years of broadcasting, the show featured numerous prominent guests including Ed Koch, Rudy Giuliani, David Dinkins, Shimon Peres, Yitzhak Rabin, and Ehud Barak. Although his show was seen weekly on WNYE-TV for years, in later years it gained ground after Arnie Mazer became the Senior Producer and when the station became NYC Media in 2005, after New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg enabled his top media executive, Arick Wierson, to merge the stations with the existing nyctv cable channels. Via nyctv, The Charney Report began podcasting its audio version on NPR and the audio component began to be nationally syndicated as radio programming. As an author Charney was the author of five books, two on topics in Judaism, The Mystery of the Kaddish: Its Profound Influence on Judaism,Michael Starr, NY Post, January 24, 2007 Cleveland Jewish News and Battle of the Two Talmuds: Judaism's Struggle with Power, Glory, & Guilt; and three about the peace process between Israel and its Arab neighbors, The Charney Report: Confronting the Israeli-Arab Conflict, Special Counsel, and Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace. Personal life Charney held an honorary title as the Chairman of the University of Haifa in Israel. Although not considered to be overtly religious, Charney was a Jewish cantor, singing on Sabbaths and Holy Jewish Holidays at places of worship across the United States. He married Israeli-born Tzili Doron and with her he had two twin boys, Mickey and Nati. Doron is a first cousin of Israeli supermodel Bar Refaeli. Charney had close ties to Israel through his sister Bryna Blumenreich Dryer, who lives in Raanana, Israel along with her children. Charney died on March 21, 2016. Philanthropy In 2003, Charney donated $10 million to NYU Langone Medical Center for a new cardiac wing of the hospital.NYU Cardiac Center He is also the major benefactor of the University of Haifa's Leon H. Charney School of Marine Sciences,http://marsci.haifa.ac.il/ for which he reportedly donated more than $10 million in 2007.  Honors  Charney received honorary doctorates for his work in peacemaking including those from the University of Haifa, Yeshiva University, Florida Atlantic University, and the University of Indianapolis. Charney also received awards from a number of institutions and city governments including the City of New York, City of Bayonne, and the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding. In 2016, the Diplomacy Program at Florida Atlantic University was named in honor of Mr. Charney.

He is an assassin who is contracted by the OAS French terrorist group of the early 1960s, to kill Charles de Gaulle, the President of France. The book was published on 7 June 1971, in the year following de Gaulle's death, and became an instant bestseller. In 1973 original film adaptation, he is portrayed by Edward Fox. A revised version of the character was portrayed by Bruce Willis in the 1997 remake adaptation of the original film, having a divergent storyline and set in the U.S., with the First Lady of the United States, Emily Cowan, as target of the assassination.  Biographical summary =Main novel plot At the beginning of the novel, the Jackal plans to continue working as an assassin until he has enough money to retire. The money paid to the Jackal to assassinate an Egyptian target had been enough to keep him in luxury for several years, but the offer of US$500,000 (about US$4 million in 2017 dollars) from the OAS to kill de Gaulle gives him the opportunity to retire early. Despite his concern over the \\"security slackness of the OAS\\", he finds the job too tempting to turn down. However, he insists that the OAS leaders in charge of the plot must not talk to anybody about the matter, and suggests they stay somewhere under heavy guard until the assassination is complete. The assassin invents the codename of the Jackal after he is hired by the OAS conspirators. When asked for his choice of codename in the novel, the Jackal replies: \\"Since we have been speaking of hunting, what about the Jackal? Will that do?\\".Forsyth (1971) p. 61 Taking his usual elaborate precautions, the Jackal arranges a false passport and forged identity documents to get him into France to get him close to de Gaulle. He also steals two passports as contingent identities and purchases disguises to match, as well as a special sniper rifle. He kills the forger, who attempts to request for more money. He later goes to France to reconnoitre the best location and does research about Charles de Gaulle, before concluding that the best time to kill the French President is on Liberation Day. Unfortunately for the Jackal, the French Action Service is able to capture and interrogate Rodin's personal bodyguard, one of the few men who is broadly aware of a plot, if not the actual details. Using OAS agent \\"Valmy\\" as a cut-out, the Jackal is kept fully informed of the French police's pursuit of him. On two occasions when the police get too close, he hides out in the home of a stranger he has seduced; once with a wealthy woman and again with a gay man he meets in a bar. He kills the former when she finds the components of his weapon, and the latter after the man watches a news report which warns people to be careful of the man who the Jackal is currently posing as. Finally, on 25 August 1963, Liberation Day, the Jackal tries to shoot de Gaulle with his rifle, which he had hidden inside a stainless steel crutch. However, the French president unexpectedly moves his head at the last moment, causing the Jackal to miss. As the Jackal prepares for a second shot, he is discovered by French police detective Claude Lebel. He uses his second shot to kill a CRS trooper who accompanied the detective to the room, but Lebel shoots him dead with the trooper's MAT-49 before the Jackal can load his third bullet. The Jackal is buried two days later in an unmarked grave; only Lebel attends, anonymously. The death certificate identifies him as \\"an unknown foreign tourist, killed in a car accident\\". Later, Charles Calthrop arrives home from vacation to find British police raiding his flat. He demands to know what is happening and is brought to the police post for questioning. It is subsequently established that Calthrop was indeed on a holiday. Both the movie and the novel end with the same comment by British authorities, when their suspect, Charles Calthrop, arrives home from vacation, alive: \\"If the Jackal wasn't Calthrop, then who the hell was he?\\" Appearance The Jackal is described as a tall, blond Englishman in his early thirties living in Mayfair, London.Forsyth (1971) p. 36 The character's real name is unknown and details of his background are sketchy. Forsyth explains in the novel, \\"Alexander Duggan who died at the age of two and a half years in 1931 ... would have been a few months older than the Jackal in July 1963\\".Forsyth (1971) p. 61 He is described by Forsyth as six feet tall, with a muscular build and few distinguishing features, one of which are his cold grey eyes. In the novel, it is stated he likes to wear striped shirts.Forsyth (1971) p. 129 During the course of the novel he changes his hair colour frequently.Forsyth (1971) pp. 282, 310 Abilities and skills The Jackal uses a numbered Swiss bank account to hold the proceeds of his work. He is a careful, sophisticated, meticulous killer who plans every detail of each assassination well in advance. No police force in Europe has ever heard of him, implying that he might change his code name for each of his missions and that he carries out his \\"contracts\\" in countries outside of Europe proper. It is also revealed the Jackal is an acquaintance of a former Congo mercenary called \\"Louis\\", whom he met in Katanga. \\"Louis\\" acts as a contact who puts the Jackal in touch with a skilled armourer who fabricates the assassin's rifle and a forger who provides false identification papers. In order to get a false identification paper, the Jackal gives his own, real, soon-to-expire driver's license to the forger with the claim that the card belongs to a dead man; when the forger tries to blackmail him for more money, the Jackal kills him. The Jackal speaks fluent French and is sufficiently skilled in hand-to-hand combat that he can kill with his bare hands. He is skilled with handguns and a marksman with a rifle. He has managed to remain anonymous except to those select few who recommend him for work. He considers his anonymity his main weapon and prefers to carry out missions alone.Forsyth (1971) pp. 49, 56 In the novel, the international police forces hunting him speculate that he may have helped assassinate Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo in the Dominican Republic by shooting the driver of his armoured car, causing it to crash.Forsyth (1971) pp. 259-260 The 1973 movie version tells not only was he involved in Trujillo's death but also killed a V.I.P. identified only as \\"that fellow from the Congo. (See other media below) Before he is approached by the OAS, the Jackal's only known confirmed kills are of two German rocket scientists in Egypt, who were helping Nasser build rockets to attack Israel. He performed this task at close range using a small- calibre weapon, a crime that left the Egyptian government furious and baffled. The Jackal was paid by a Zionist millionaire in New York, who considered his money \\"well spent\\".Forsyth (1971) pp. 36-37 While his last job has made him well off, he takes the OAS contract because he wishes to \\"retire\\". Although he keeps an expansive flat in London, he knows that De Gaulle's avengers will not stop until they have tracked him down; with the money from the OAS he plans to retire to Beirut, Lebanon. Identities The Jackal's true name is never discovered by the authorities or revealed to the reader. He uses the following identities in the course of the novel: * Alexander James Quentin \\"Alex\\" Duggan: This is the name of a boy who was born in 1929, the same year that the Jackal was born, but died aged two and a half in a car accident. The Jackal obtains Duggan's birth certificate under false pretences and applies for a passport in this name but with his own photograph and details. * Per Jensen: A pastor from Copenhagen who bears a reasonable resemblance to the Jackal but is older with iron grey hair and gold-rimmed spectacles. The man steals Pastor Jensen's passport from his London hotel room and adopts the disguise after his cover as Duggan is accidentally blown by both the French police and a woman he seduces and hides out with. * Martin \\"Marty\\" Schulberg: A student from Syracuse University who is also somewhat similar to the Jackal but is younger with chestnut brown hair and heavy-rimmed executive spectacles. The Jackal steals Schulberg's handgrip containing his passport from London airport and adopts the disguise when he realises the police must be on to Jensen, enhancing his cover to avoid them by posing as a flamboyant homosexual. * Andr√© Martin: A fictitious French war veteran from Alsace-Lorraine, Martin is in his 50s and has only one leg, necessitating walking around with an aluminium crutch. The Jackal becomes Martin ‚Äî complete with French identity card and war wounded card courtesy of a Belgian forger ‚Äî by dyeing his hair grey and cutting it badly, swallowing a couple of pieces of cordite to make himself sick and affect a pale complexion, and folding his leg back and binding it with a webbing strap to mimic an amputated leg. * Charles Calthrop: Charles Calthrop is the name of a former small-arms salesman who was in the Dominican Republic at the time Rafael Le√≥nidas Trujillo was shot. The SIS later heard a rumour that Calthrop has helped the partisans kill Trujillo by shooting the driver of his armoured car, causing it to crash. The British police in the book surmise that Calthrop is the Jackal's real name, until the real Calthrop shows up at the end, after the Jackal was killed. The authorities were misled by the fact that chacal (i.e., Cha[rles] Cal[throp]) is French for \\"jackal\\". Police investigations show that the real Charles Calthrop went on a holiday with what looked like fishing rods in his car, leading the police to believe that he was armed with weapons. When the Jackal learns the French are looking for a Charles Calthrop, he doesn't react with any apparent concern (as might be the case if it were his real name). In other media In the 1973 adaptation of the novel, the Jackal is portrayed by Edward Fox. Some of the Jackal's background details are clarified: The dossier the OAS read from states that the Jackal killed Trujillo and the \\"fellow in the Congo\\" (presumably Dag Hammarskj√∂ld or Patrice Lumumba). Within the movie, his alias names vary slightly from the ones he uses in the novel. In the 1997 remake of the original film, the Jackal is portrayed by Bruce Willis. This version of the character differs substantially from the novel and original film: in this film, he is an assassin hired by an Azerbaijani mobster to assassinate the First Lady of the United States, and characterized as a sociopath who takes pleasure in killing. He is pursued by agents of the FBI and the MVD, as well as a former Irish Republican Army sharpshooter with a vendetta against him. \\"Carlos The Jackal\\" Real-life terrorist Ilich Ram√≠rez S√°nchez, already known under the code name \\"Carlos\\", was further nicknamed \\"The Jackal\\" after a copy of The Day of the Jackal belonging to a friend was found in his hiding place.

Aside from playing bass, she sang lead vocals on live versions of \\"Under Pressure\\" (taking the part originally sung by Queen frontman Freddie Mercury) and dueted with Bowie on other songs, including \\"The London Boys\\", \\"Aladdin Sane (1913-1938-197?)\\", \\"I Dig Everything\\", accompanying Bowie on clarinet, and a cover of Laurie Anderson's \\"O Superman\\". From 1993 to 1996, Dorsey recorded and toured with Tears for Fears, and collaborated on songwriting with the band. She appeared in several of the band's promo videos throughout this period. Her diverse range of work includes performances and recordings with, among others, The National, Lenny Kravitz, Bryan Ferry, Boy George, the Indigo Girls, Khaled, Jane Siberry, The The, Skin, Gwen Stefani, Charlie Watts, Seal, Gang of Four, Susan Werner, Ani DiFranco and Dar Williams. In addition, Dorsey has released three solo albums: The Corporate World (1988), Rude Blue (1992), and I Used To Be... (2003).  Early life  Dorsey grew up in the 1970s in West Philadelphia. She played guitar from the age of nine and cites Mark Farner of Grand Funk Railroad, Terry Kath of Chicago, Jimi Hendrix, and Nancy Wilson of Heart as early influences. She acquired a bass guitar shortly after her 14th birthday but didn't consider herself a bass player until she was 20. She also wrote feature-length screenplays to accompany some of her musical compositions. Dorsey attended the California Institute of the Arts in the School of Film and Video. Her screenplays and short Super 8 films earned her a full scholarship. Dorsey was the only woman in her freshman class and the youngest woman to be admitted to the Live Action department up to that point. After completing three semesters she felt unsuited for the film industry and once again turned to a career in music.  Career  At the age of 22, Dorsey moved to London to pursue her musical career, where she was in a musical collaboration/band 20To with keyboard player/composer Pete Stern. Their first demos were engineered and produced by Paul \\"Doc\\" Stewart at Village Way Studio in London. Stewart was responsible for their introduction to CBS Records, which led to her first recording deal. She also composed the music for the Theatre of Black Women play Chiaroscuro in 1985, and was in the band for the show. She then established herself through collaborations with artists such as Boy George, Ann Pigalle, and Donny Osmond. Dorsey's first high-profile job was as a guest vocalist in the original line up of The Charlie Watts Big Band and its 1985 premiere at London's famous West End jazz club, Ronnie Scott's. An important point in Dorsey's solo career was her appearance on The Tube, a weekly music television hosted by Jools Holland and Paula Yates. In December 1987, Dorsey signed with Warner Music Group and in 1988 released her first solo album, The Corporate World. The album was produced by bassist Nathan East of the jazz quartet Fourplay and included appearances by artists such as Eric Clapton. It received a five-star review and was voted one of the Top 50 Albums of the Year by London's Q magazine. She moved to Island Records in 1991, signed by founder Chris Blackwell. In 1992, she released her second solo album entitled Rude Blue, which featured trumpeter Mark Pender and trombonist Richie \\"La Bamba\\" (from Conan O'Brien's house band), Carla Azar on drums (from Wendy & Lisa), Carol Steele on percussion, and the famous James Brown horn section of Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley, and Alfred \\"Pee Wee\\" Ellis. After almost 12 years in England, Dorsey relocated to the artist community of Woodstock in upstate New York in 1994. When her relationship with Island became strained, Dorsey began to concentrate on session work and in 1995 was recruited for David Bowie's Outside Tour. Throughout the remainder of the 1990s and into the 21st century she performed and recorded with artists such as Gang Of Four, Louise Goffin, world music stars Rachid Taha, Faudel, and Khaled (on their live album 1, 2, 3 Soleils), Sophie B. Hawkins, Tears For Fears, The The, The Indigo Girls, Canadian artist Jane Siberry, Jeffrey Gaines, Italian blues man Zucchero, Dar Williams, Catie Curtis, Toshi Reagon, Joan Osborne, The B-52s, and Michael Hutchence of INXS. Dorsey is perhaps best known for her contribution to the David Bowie band. After the Outside Tour she provided vocals and bass for Earthling (1997), Heathen (2002), Reality (2003) and The Next Day (2013). She recorded \\"Planet of Dreams\\", a duet with Bowie on the 1997 EMI UK benefit CD release, Long Live Tibet, as well as several other live recordings and videos. She was on board for the last six tours and performed with Bowie at \\"The Concert For New York\\" at Madison Square Garden. About a decade after Rude Blue, Dorsey released her third solo album in 2003. The album entitled I Used To Be is a collection of previously unreleased material spanning the past 18 years of Dorsey's songwriting archives. She wrote all songs herself with the exception of a few collaborators, namely Roland Orzabal and singer-songwriter Kristen Hall. I Used To Be was produced by Dorsey and engineer/producer Brandon Mason, with long-time friend and fellow bassist Sara Lee as executive producer. In 2017, Dorsey joined the Celebrating David Bowie tour from January 2, 2017 to February 2, 2017, alongside other musicians and collaborators of David Bowie.Johnson, Kevin (January 5, 2017), \\"Gail Ann Dorsey Joins Celebrating David Bowie Tour\\", No Treble. Style and influences Dorsey's musical style has a broad span and incorporates rock, funk, country, and pop influences. She describes her current sound as a present-day version of the AM/FM radio tunes that left a mark on her music such as The Fifth Dimension, Olivia Newton-John, Bread and Heart. When asked to describe her sound in one word she says \\"Black-arach...but that's maybe how I feel most days. Sometimes you can never tell what vehicle is required to deliver the message until it tells you. I don't want to limit myself to anything. I just want to maintain honesty and substance in the work. That is my responsibility to the music and the audience.\\"  Discography = Solo albums  *The Corporate World (1988) (Sire Records) *Rude Blue (1992) (Island Records) *I Used To Be...

The club won Division Four at the first attempt, and were promoted to Division Three, which they won in 1999‚Äì2000. In 2000‚Äì01 they were promoted to Division One. However, after missing out on promotion to the Senior Division in 2001‚Äì02, the following season they narrowly avoided being relegated back to Division Two in 2002‚Äì03. After Mel Aldis was appointed manager in the summer of 2003, the club won Division One in 2003‚Äì04 to earn promotion to the Senior Division. The title was claimed following a 10‚Äì0 win against Ipswich Exiles to overtake Framlingham Town on goal difference. In their first season in the Senior Division Debenham finished runners-up to East Bergholt United, and were promoted to Division One of the Eastern Counties League. Upon moving up the club adopted their current name. In 2008-09 they were promoted to the Premier Division, after winning 7‚Äì0 at March Town United on the final day of the season to pip Halstead Town to third place on goal difference, having needed to win by three goals and hope Halstead failed to win (they drew 1‚Äì1 with Great Yarmouth Town).

Kashyapa married Kadru and twelve of Daksha's other daughters. Kashyapa was the son of Marichi, who was the manasputra or mind-born (spiritual) son of Brahma. Kadru was the mother of a thousand nƒÅgas. Legends of Kadru tell of her relationship with her elder sister Vinata, who was also one of Kashyapa's many wives. In one story, Kadru and Vinata vie to bear children of Kashyapa who are more powerful than each other's children. While Kadru gives birth to a thousand nƒÅgas, Vinata has two sons, Aru·πáa and Garuda. Kadru is also portrayed as more scheming and wily than Vinata. She challenges Vinata to guess the colour of the tail of Uchchaihshravas, the divine white horse. After Vinata says the tail is white, Kadru tricks Vinata by directing her sons to coil around the horse's tail, causing it to appear black. As a result, Vinata loses the bet and she and her sons must become the slaves of Kadru and her sons. Another legend states that when Kadru asks Garuda to take her sons on his back to the abode of the sun so they can pay obeisance and they are scorched, Vinata asks Garuda to carry water of the Ganges from the netherworld and sprinkle it on the nƒÅgas to revive them. In another tale, Kadru and Suparna, another of Kashyapa's wives, disobey Kashyapa and disrupt some sages who are performing rites on the banks of the Ganga. As a result, they are turned into rivers. Kashyapa is only able to restore them to their original forms by performing penance to Shiva. Genealogy Generally, Kadru is described as the daughter of Daksha Prajapati and the wife of the sage Maharishi Kashyapa. The Hindu epic the Mahabharata, which gives a detailed tale about her, recognizes her as one of Kashyapa's many wives. There is also a view that she was the daughter of Daksha, but it has not been established from Puranic literature. In the Aranyakanda of the Valmiki Ramayana it is mentioned that Daksaprajapati had sixty daughters of whom he married off Aditi, Diti, Danu, Kalika, Tamra, Krodhavasa, Muni and Surasa to Kashyapa. Krodhavasa had eight daughters of whom Kadru was one. Thus, Kadru may alternatively be considered the granddaughter of Daksha. Vinata, Kadru's sister, is another wife of Kashyapa. According to the Sabha Parva of the Mahabharata, Kadru lived in Brahmaloka, the abode of Brahma. In the Vana Parva of the Mahabharata it is stated that to destroy the embryo in a woman, Kadru enters her womb by assuming a very tiny form called \\"Skanda graha\\". Legends A relief of a nƒÅga or serpent deity in Gudilova, Andhra Pradesh, India Kadru was the younger sister of Vinata, and when they both lived with Kashyapa as his wives and attended to all his comforts he blessed them by granting each of them a boon. Kadru asked for a thousand nƒÅga or serpent sons who should be valiant. Prompted by her sister's demand for sons, Vinata asked for only two sons who should be more powerful and bright than Kadru's children. Kashaya granted them their wishes. After his wives became pregnant, he advised them to look after the children, and then left for his penance in the forest. After a long time Kadru gave birth to a thousand eggs and Vinata to two eggs. The eggs were carefully incubated in containers with hot water or in jars which were kept warm. After a lapse of five hundred years, the eggs laid by Kadru hatched and her sons came to life; of these thousand nƒÅga sons, the most prominent ones were Shesha, Vasuki and Takshaka. All the serpents born in this world are the descendants of these thousand sons. Vinata became jealous as her eggs had not hatched. In a moment of haste, she broke open one of the eggs, revealing a half-formed son. This son was enraged by his physical form and cursed his mother for her hasty act, saying she would be a slave to Kadru for five hundred years till the son from her second egg was born. He became a charioteer and herald for the sun god and the creator of the red sky at dawn, and was therefore named Aru·πáa. Eventually, after five hundred years, Vinata's second son Garuda was born in the form of a huge bird with immense power. As soon as he was born he flew away with grace, seeking food. A 1944 photograph by Cecil Beaton of Hindus bathing in the Ganga or Ganges at Kalighat, Kolkata, India, to purify themselves before visiting the nearby Temple of Kali According to the Brahma Purana, Kashyapa, who is also known as Prajapati Kashayapa, was approached by the Valakhilyas. Offering him half of their ascetic powers, they requested that he beget them a son who could take revenge on Indra who had insulted them. Kashyapa then had one son from each of his two wives, Kadru the mother of snakes and Suparna. Before going on an errand, Kashyapa instructed his wives not to leave the house as they would create mischief and do evil acts and eventually come to grief. In spite of these instructions, Kadru and Suparna went out to the banks of the Ganga where enlightened sages were performing sattra rites and started disturbing the rites. Infuriated, the sages cursed them to become rivers. Kashyapa returned home to find his wives, but was told of the incident by the sages. When Kashyapa asked how he might retrieve his wives, the sages advised him to do penance to Shiva at Gautami Ganga. Kashyapa prayed by reciting a hymn that praised Shiva in the role of a triad, his role in the three worlds, and his three gunas (qualities of virtue, merit, excellence),Pleased with Kashyapa's hymn, Shiva restored to him his wives, and blessed the wives so that they would beget children again by the grace of Ganga. Kashyapa invited the sages to participate in the fourth-to-sixth month hair-parting ceremony of his pregnant wives. After the sages were fed, when Kashyapa respectfully stood before them with his wife to thank them, Kadru looked at the sages and gave them a sly look with one of her eyes. The sages were annoyed and cursed Kadru to lose that eye. Thus, Kadru became one-eyed. Once Kadru called Vinata and asked her to tell her the colour of Uccaissravas, the divine white horse which emanated from the ocean when it was churned by the devas and asuras to generate nectar. Without any guile Vinata said that it was pure white. Kadru contradicted her and said that its tail was black. An argument ensued, and Kadru challenged Vinata to a bet, saying that whoever lost the bet would have to become the other's servant. Intending to cheat Vinata, Kadru called her thousand sons to coil around Uccaissravas's tail neatly so that it appeared black in colour. While some of her sons obeyed her instructions, others refused to oblige her. Those who disobeyed her instructions were cursed by Kadru, and she prophesied that they would be charred alive in the sarpa satra yagana (snake sacrifice) that would be performed by King Janamejaya of Hastinapur. Kashyapa was upset by this curse, but Brahma who happened to be there told him such a curse was essential as serpents had become very dangerous to society. Brahma then gave Kashyapa the antidote for snake poisoning. Kadru won the bet as the nƒÅgas had wound around Uccaissravas's tail, giving it a black shade. Vinata thus became the slave of Kadru. A statue of Garuda from the Chennakesava temple in Belur, Karnataka, India On another occasion, Kadru suggested to Vinata that Vinata should take Kadru, and that Garuda should take her nƒÅga sons, to the beautiful island of Ramaniyaka in the middle of the ocean within the abode of snakes. Vinata and Garuda did as directed. After reaching the destination Kadru asked Garuda to take her sons to the abode of the sun to pay their respectful obeisance. Garuda carried the nƒÅga sons of Kadru on his back and approached the sun. As he flew closer, the nƒÅgas could not withstand the heat and started falling off him to the ground in a faint, on the island of Virana. Hearing the cries of her children, Kadru was deeply distressed and blamed Garuda for what had happened to her children. Vinata, distressed by her son's plight and, following a suggestion by Kadru, asked Garuda to bring water of the Ganga from the netherworld. Garuda obeyed and brought the water to the southern bank of the Gautami river and sprinkled it on the snakes, which then revived. The place where this incident occurred is called Nagalaya, the abode of the snakes. In another version of the story related in the Adi Parva of the Valmiki Ramayana, it is said that when the nƒÅgas fainted and fell to the ground due to intense heat of the sun, Kadru offered prayers to Indra to come to her children's rescue. Indra promptly created rain showers to fall on the nƒÅgas and they were restored from their charred state. They then lived in the island of Ramaniyaka.

Background Conceived by Eugene M. Lang, a retired businessman known for his educational philanthropy, Project Pericles seeks to counter the growing political cynicism and civic disengagement of young people. Convinced that higher education must promote social and civic engagement, in 1999 Lang organized a planning committee and consulted with college presidents, trustees, faculty, students, and others. By the end of 2000, the objectives, policies, and startup plans of Project Pericles were set. Ten colleges and universities became ‚Äúfounding Pericleans.‚Äù The Boards of the Pericleans formally committed their institutions to the policies and objectives of Project Pericles. Their presidents formed a Presidents‚Äô Council to cooperate in policy-making and program development and implementation. The planning committee became the Board of Directors. Distinguished educational, business, political, and community leaders became the National Board of Advisors. In April 2003, the first ten Pericleans met in New York for the first national conference of Project Pericles. Delegates included presidents, provosts, deans, faculty, students, and alumni. In August 2003, Project Pericles established an independent office and hired Karen E. Holt as Executive Director. In November 2005, Jan R. Liss became its second Executive Director. In 2004 and 2005, a select group of new Pericleans added to the diversity of Project Pericles. The spirit of Pericleans and cumulative experience continue to strengthen Project Pericles in its mission as a transforming force for higher education.

She became a star under Bhavnani's direction at Kohinoor before moving on to the Imperial Film Company where she became the highest paid movie star in the country. Among her popular films were Typist Girl (1926), Balidaan (1927) and Wildcat of Bombay (1927) where she essayed eight roles including a gardener, a policeman, a Hyderabadi gentleman, a street urchin, a banana seller and a European blonde. Three romantic super hits in 1928 - 29 with director R.S. Chaudhari - Madhuri (1928), Anarkali (1928) and Indira B.A. (1929) saw her at her peak of fame in the silent film era. In fact so widespread was her fame that when a short film on Mahatma Gandhi inaugurating a khadi exhibition was shown, alongside it was added a hugely popular dance of Sulochana's from Madhuri, synchronised with sound effects. With the coming of sound, Sulochana suddenly found a lull in her career, as it now required an actor to be proficient in Hindustani. Taking a year off to learn the language, she made a grand comeback with the talkie version of Madhuri (1932). Further talkie versions of her silent hits followed and with Indira (now an) M.A. (1934), Anarkali (1935) and Bombay ki Billi (1936). Sulochana was back with a bang. She was drawing a salary of Rs 5000 per month, she had the sleekest of cars (Chevrolet 1935) and one of the biggest heroes of the silent era, D. Billimoria, as her lover with whom she worked exclusively between 1933 and 1939. They were an extremely popular pair - his John Barrymore-style opposite her Oriental 'Queen of Romance' image. But once their love story ended so did their careers. Sulochana left Imperial to find few offers forthcoming. Newer, younger and more proficient actresses had entered the scene. She tried making a comeback with character roles but even these were few. However, she still had the power to excite controversy. In 1947, Morarji Desai banned the Dilip Kumar - Noor Jehan starrer, Jugnu, because it showed such a morally reprehensible act as an aging fellow professor falling for Sulochana's vintage charms. In 1953, she acted in her third Anarkali, but this time in a supporting role as Salim's mother. Her films include Cinema Queen (1926), Typist Girl (1926), Balidaan (1927), Wild Cat of Bombay, in which she played eight different characters, which was remade as Bambai Ki Billi (1936); Madhuri (1928), which was re-released with sound in 1932; Anarkali (1928), remade in 1945; Indira BA (1929); Heer Ranjah (1929), and many others, such as Baaz (1953). Sulochana established her own film studio, Rubi Pics, in the mid-1930s. She received the Dada Saheb Phalke Award in 1973 for her lifetime contribution to Indian cinema.Madurainetwork.com - Dada Saheb Phalke Award Ismail Merchant paid homage to her in Mahatma and the Bad Boy (1974). thumb She died in 1983 in her flat in Mumbai.

It was founded by Daniel Kolawole Olukoya (\\"DKO\\"). Many publications on deliverance have been credited to Olukoya, such as the popular prayer book known as The Prayer Bible. Unlike a few popular charismatic and Pentecostal African initiated ministries promoting prosperity gospel, MFM's leadership and its sub-ministry, Battle Cry Ministries, place emphasis on deliverance ministry and prayers against the works of demonic forces. It incorporates an African spiritual worldview (to an extent of being mildly syncretist with ministration of dealing with ancestral spirits) and the existence of hidden evil and spiritual forces against progress toward the fulfilment of one's \\"destiny\\" as part of its theology, resulting in a theology that promotes ritualistic practices dominated by prayer points to free individuals from those hidden forces.http://firepowerministry.org/blog/deliverance-from-spirit-wives-and- spirit-husbands-incubus-and-succubus/  History  Mountain Of Fire And Miracles Ministries was founded by Daniel Kolawole Olukoya at a prayer meeting in 1989 in his living room. The prayer group purchased a large site at an abandoned slum near the University of Lagos, and converted it into the International Headquarters of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, of which Olukoya is the General Overseer. The first service there was on 24 April 1994. At the new location, worshippers and those seeking help kept coming, leading to a very large congregation. This situation posed a challenge of crowd, growth and expansion management to the leadership of the church. Thus, MFM created a network of branches in every state capital, local government headquarters, senatorial district and locality. According to the group's literature, it is committed to \\"the Revival of Apostolic Signs, Holy Ghost fireworks and the unlimited demonstration of the power of God to deliver to the uttermost\\". name=\\"mountainoffire.org\\"> As the name would imply, the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries places a great emphasis on wonders, miracles and other Apostolic acts. Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries church in East Providence, Rhode Island From humble beginnings in the home of Olukoya, MFM has grown to over 300 churches within Nigeria and branches in African and Western countries. Those branches located outside the African continent mainly cater to African immigrant population.  Distinctive practices  Visible among book sellers on the street of the church's headquarters is MFM's leadership litany of publications on prayer points against demonic and hidden forces opposed to personal fulfillment and growth. MFM describes itself as \\"a do-it-yourself gospel ministry, where your hands are trained to wage war and your fingers to do battle.\\" This militant tone against spiritual wickedness is reflected throughout the teachings of MFM, where it calls upon members to become spiritually aggressive Christians, and some of the groups founded by MFM call themselves names such as the Prayer Warriors, the Territorial Intercessors and the God's Violent Army. This does not mean physical violence by MFM theology, as the battles take place in spiritual realms only. For unclear reasons, all women are required to wear skirts and headcovers when attending MFM services in any location. Prayers tend to be repetitions of faith-based claims, spiritual decrees and commanding prayers often directly from Scriptures and proclaim that safety lies within Jesus Christ. Although prayers are loud and believed to be \\"spiritually violent\\", it is noteworthy that the church preaches against physical violence, typically alluding to Paul's teachings on Christian warfare (, ). Olukoya teaches that \\"The Bible refers to homosexuals and lesbians as dogs\\". Its \\"deliverance\\" events have been viewed as code for \\"pray the gay away\\". An undercover reporter in Liverpool was urged by an assistant pastor to cure himself of homosexuality by fasting for 3 days; however, MFM said that this was not sanctioned by the movement, and denied that it promoted conversion therapy.  Leadership  MFM is headed by a General Overseer, who is also the main theologian of the church. He is assisted by Assistant General Overseers, helming specific departments.  Properties  Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries Main Entrance MFM owns a large expanse of land along Lagos‚ÄìIbadan Expressway called Prayer City, located close to the international camp of the Redeemed Christian Church of God. Among structures located within the camp is an auditorium capable of holding 100,000 members during special occasions. In Enugu, MFM's worship centre was judged to have been constructed illegally, and despite its popularity it was demolished in 2013 by the state government.  Lawsuit in United States  In 2017, the church had some legal battles with some former pastors who separated from MFM and claimed a church building in the United States. The former pastors alleged that Olukoya engaged in fraud including evasion of US import duties. In particular, it was argued that books penned by the General Overseer were shipped to the United States as donations for MFM parishioners (thereby evading import fees) but in actuality, the pastors were instructed to sell them to members and return the profits to MFM HQ. The property dispute was settled in favour of the church.  Investigation in United Kingdom  The UK Charity Commission (which regulates registered charities in the UK) opened an official investigation into the church in 2018, citing concerns about administrative and financial weaknesses, including failure to submit the required accounts. In August 2019, the Commission appointed an interim manager for the MFM charity.

From 1512 to 1515 he rebuilt the Dominican church in that city, for which some of the funds were obtained through the preaching of a jubilee permitted by Pope Leo X and also, after a prohibition, by the Emperor Maximilian I. Maximilian made him court preacher and royal counselor. On the recommendation of Erasmus, with whom he was very friendly, he was again appointed to these offices by Maximilian's successor, King Charles V.

Lee, 311 U.S. 32 (1940), is a famous case now usually known in civil procedure for teaching that res judicata may not bind a subsequent plaintiff who had no opportunity to be represented in the earlier civil action. The facts of the case dealt with a racially restrictive covenant that barred African Americans from purchasing or leasing land in the Washington Park Subdivision of Chicago's Woodlawn neighborhood. The covenant had been upheld in a prior class action lawsuit, which had included Lee, along with all the other neighborhood landowners, as members of the class. The defense in the present case argued that Carl Augustus Hansberry (father of Lorraine Hansberry) could not contest the covenant because it had already been deemed valid by the courts in the prior lawsuit. The plaintiff's case was successfully argued by civil rights attorney Earl B. Dickerson. The United States Supreme Court ruled that since some of the neighborhood landowners (46%) comprising the class of the prior lawsuit did not support the restrictive covenant, the previous decision that the covenant was valid could not apply to all members of that class. In other words, it was erroneous to allow the 54% of neighborhood landowners who had supported the restrictive covenant to represent the interests of the 46% who were against it. Therefore, the Supreme Court held that the restrictive covenant could be contested in court again, even though some of the parties involved may have been included in the prior class of neighborhood landowner. Later, the type of real property restriction, racially restrictive covenants, was held by Shelley v. Kraemer, , to be unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment and were therefore legally unenforceable state action, as the private plaintiffs seeking to enforce such a covenant were invoking the machinery of the state.

It is the sequel to the Sega Dreamcast game Airforce Delta. A game also named Airforce Delta Storm was released in 2002 for the Game Boy Advance. While having the same name, this game's plot is based on the previous title in the series, Airforce Delta.  Story  The Story of AFDS is set in a fictional-time (20X1-20X7) when scientific technology has reached an all new level and the ability to cure almost all Human diseases has become a reality. However, as a result, the Earth has become overpopulated and basic necessities are becoming scarce. In the midst of the growing epidemic, those nations that are highly industrialized but not producing enough food for themselves banded to form the \\"United Forces\\" and use their military advantage to seize agricultural lands whereas those nations that are under the threat of United Forces invasion have pooled their resources to form the \\"Allied Forces.\\"  Gameplay  The Gameplay of AFDS is very similar to its predecessor Airforce Delta, in the sense that the player controls various aircraft to engage enemies and accomplish missions. A new feature of AFDS is the 'World Map' where the player moves his aircraft across the map through various checkpoints and flies to a mission. Some of these checkpoints however can be 'recaptured' by the enemy so the player must make careful account of how much 'Range' his aircraft has; 'Range' allows the player to continue across the map without having to deal with enemy forces. When the player locates the mission on- screen the player flies his aircraft towards the mission icon (either a land- based structure or a ship) and selects it. There are three levels of controls, ranging from novice, which allows you to pick up the game and play without having to learn how to control pitch and yaw and how to do a complex roll during a corkscrewing backflip. There is expert, where you can control the pitch and yaw of the plane and even do rolls. Then there is ace, the only way ace differs from expert is that you can use the airbrake feature and the throttle sticks in place after you let go of the increase/decrease speed buttons.  Differences  There are several differences between AFDS and its predecessor Airforce Delta, here are some examples: *AFDS does not allow the player to choose a difficulty level. *The Player can choose the colour of (but cannot edit) the HUD. *AFDS does not allow the player to check his or her stats.  Reception  The game received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave the Game Boy Advance and Xbox versions each a score of 29 out of 40.

Teimuraz was also a lyric poet.  Life  He was a son of Erekle I and his wife Anna. Together with his mother, Teimuraz ruled as regent for his absent brother David II (Imam Quli-Khan) from 1709 to 1715. In 1732, the Turks killed the next king and Teimuraz‚Äôs other brother, Constantine, and took control of his kingdom. His successor, Teimuraz, fled to the mountains of Pshavi and fought the occupants from there. In July 1735, the resurgent Persian ruler Nader Shah Afshar invaded Kakheti and forced the Turks out of most of eastern Georgia. Nader summoned Teimuraz to his headquarters at Erivan and, upon his refusal to convert to Islam, had him detained. Kakheti was placed under the nominal government of Teimuraz's Muslim nephew Ali Mirza. In October 1735, Teimuraz escaped to the mountains of Kakheti and fomented unrest against the Persian rule, but he was captured by the close of 1736. During these years, part of Georgian nobles staged a powerful rebellion against the Persian regime. In 1738, the shah had to release Teimuraz to counter the Georgian opposition, and made him governor of Kakheti, while his son Erekle II campaigned with Nader in India. The uprising now turned into a brutal civil war between pro- and anti-Persian factions. Teimuraz, aided by his son Erekle II, was able to crush the rebels led by Givi Amilakhvari. As a reward, the shah abolished, in 1742, a heavy tribute laid upon Kakheti, and helped Teimuraz to subdue autonomous duchies of the Aragvi and the Ksani in 1743 and 1744 respectively. For his service against the Ottomans and an anti-Persian revolt, in 1744, Teimuraz was confirmed by the shah as king of Kartli, and his son Erekle was given a Kakhetian crown, thus laying the ground for the eventual reunification of these Georgian kingdoms. Most importantly, they were recognised as Christian kings for the first time since 1632. Both monarchs were crowned at the Cathedral of the Living Pillar (Svetitskhoveli) at Mtskheta on October 1, 1745. With their power growing increasingly stronger, Teimuraz and Erekle soon repudiated their allegiance to the Persian suzerain. Nader Shah ordered 30,000 Persian troops to move into Georgia and entrusted a Georgian convert (and a former anti-Persian leader) Amilakhvari with the punitive operation. The shah was, however, murdered in 1747, and his empire became engulf into complete chaos. The rulers of Kartli and Kakheti took advantage of the situation and expelled all Persian garrisons from their kingdoms. From 1749 to 1750, they checked several attempts of Persian pretenders to create their powerbase in the eastern Transcaucasia, and made the neighbouring khanates of Yerevan, Ganja, and Nakhichevan their tributaries. He fought then against the Dagestani clansmen who frequently raided the Georgian marchlands, but without complete success. Like several previous Georgian rulers, he hoped that the expanding Russian empire would be the only protector for the Christians of Caucasus against the Ottoman and Persian aggressions. He sent an embassy to St Petersburg in 1752, but nothing came of this mission. In 1760, he visited the Russian court himself to gain a support for his project of a Georgian expedition to Persia to put a Russian candidate on the shah‚Äôs throne. The Russians were too preoccupied with the Seven Years' War to seriously consider Teimuraz‚Äôs idea. He died suddenly in the Russian capital on January 8, 1762 (just a fortnight after Elizabeth of Russia incidentally), and was buried next to his father-in-law Vakhtang VI in the Cathedral of the Assumption, Astrakhan. On his death, Erekle succeeded as king of Kartli, bringing both eastern Georgian kingdoms into a single state (Kingdom of Kartli and Kakheti) Although he was constantly at war or on guard, Teimuraz found some time to translate from Persian and compose, virtually on horseback, his own poems and lyrics.

Retrieved 2013-08-02.  Family  Teimuraz married three times. He divorced his first wife, a daughter of Duke Baadur of the Aragvi, probably called Tamar, in 1711. Two years later, on February 2, 1712, he remarried Vakhtang VI's daughter Tamar (born 1696), who died on April 12, 1746. The same year, on August 19, Teimuraz married his third wife, Ana-Khanum (1716 ‚Äî March 1788), daughter of Prince Bejan Palavankhosroshvili-Baratashvili, and former wife of Prince Kaikhosro Tsitsishvili. He had two sons and four daughters by his second and third marriages. Teimuraz's children of his marriage to Tamar of Kartli were: * Heraclius II (November 7, 1720 ‚Äì January 11, 1798), the future king of Kakheti and of Kartli and Kakheti. * Princess Ketevan, who married, in 1737 at Mashhad Adil Shah of Iran (1719‚Äì1749). * Princess Elene (fl. 1743‚Äì1784), who married, c. 1743, Prince Zaza Tsitsishvili. * Princess Ana (1720 ‚Äì December 4, 1788), who married firstly, in 1744, Prince Dimitri Orbeliani (died 1776) and secondly Prince Ioane Orbeliani (c. 1702 ‚Äì 1781). Teimuraz's union with Ana-Khanum Baratashvili produced: * Prince Solomon (May 24, 1747 ‚Äì July 28, 1749). * Princess Elisabed (March 25, 1750 ‚Äì May 8, 1770), who was betrothed to Prince Giorgi Amilakhvari in 1762, but the marriage was disrupted for political reasons in 1765 and Elisabed was given in marriage, on November 16, 1765, to Katsia II Dadiani, Prince of Mingrelia (died 1788).

It was founded by Steve Wilton and Damien Fox in January 2005, and turned its DSL internet connections over to private ISP TekSavvy in March 2009. All WiFi nodes were subsequently shut down. Instead of using Bell Sympatico's or Rogers Cable's retail high-speed Internet access services to provide service to their wireless access points, they were their own ISP under Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) rules that compel large providers like Rogers and Bell to resell their local loop cable and DSL circuits to smaller ISPs at a regulated (tariffed) price. At the time of its disbanding in mid-2009, WN charged C$36.95+GST per month to members who signed up for home Internet service (3~5 Mbit/s down/720 kbit/s up), which was less than Bell and Rogers charged for their high-speed Internet access service. WN Business service was $59.95 a month. Wireless Nomad was one of the few ISPs in Canada that did not ban its residential subscribers from operating servers. Port 25 was also open for outgoing traffic. The service covered several areas, mainly in downtown Toronto. In October 2006, following the fictional narrative in Cory Doctorow's Someone Comes to Town, Someone Leaves Town, the co-op deployed a large antenna in Toronto's Kensington Market, covering about one quarter of the neighborhood with free WiFi Internet. The antenna and WiFi gear was removed from Kensington and installed on the rooftop of Linuxcaffe (named after the Linux Operating system) on the corner of Harbord St. and Grace St. in downtown Toronto in June 2008. WN used Free and open source software exclusively for its servers, Web site, and wireless routers. The servers ran Gentoo Linux, and the Linksys WRT54GL routers at each location ran OpenWrt, ChilliSpot, and OpenVPN. Wi-Fi mesh networking using OLSR was also part of WN's deployment, with several small mesh networks in use in Toronto. WN's servers were hosted by the Toronto Community Co-location Project in downtown Toronto from January, 2005 until May 2008. Colan Schwartz wrote the billing system, and Jorge Torres-Solis wrote custom firmware for the routers. Wireless Nomad was a Community Partner with the Canadian Research Alliance for Community Innovation and Networking (CRACIN) and the Community Wireless Infrastructure Research Project (CWIRP) through Prof. Andrew Clement and Matthew A. Wong (graduate student) with the University of Toronto Faculty of Information (formerly Faculty of Information Studies).

Plot summary Juan Dahlmann is an obscure secretary in an Argentine library. Although of German descent, he is proud of his Argentine maternal ancestors: his military grandfather had died fighting the aboriginals in the wild Pampas \\"pierced by the Indians of Catriel,\\" a romantic end that he enjoys thinking about. He has a number of family heirlooms: an old sword, a lithograph photo, and a small estate in southern Argentina he has never found time to visit. In February 1939, he obtains a copy of Weil's Arabian Nights. He takes the book home, and‚Äîeager to examine it‚Äîrushes up the stairs. In his haste and because he‚Äôs looking at the book and not where he‚Äôs going, he cuts his scalp on the sharp edge of a window frame left open. The wound Dahlmann suffers keeps him bedridden at home with a very high fever. After a few days of perplexing and horrifying discomfort, he is moved by his doctors to the hospital, where, instead of helping, the treatment for his injury causes him greater suffering. Rendered helpless and confined in an anonymous room, he feels humiliation and self-hatred, almost as though he were in hell. (It warrants noting at this point that, in the Prologue for '‚ÄôArtifices, Borges explicitly acknowledges an alternative interpretation of the narrative, while refraining from giving any details or hints with respect to its nature. He writes: \\"Of 'The South,' which is perhaps my best story, let it suffice for me to suggest that it can be read as a direct narrative of novelistic events, and also in another way.\\" With this in mind, one may well reinterpret the story such that everything after Dahlmann's darkest moments in the hospital is a narration of his idealized death‚Äîthe one Juan Dahlmann fabricates and enacts in his feverish mind while on the verge of a pathetic demise in the hospital he never really leaves. He imagines the journey south in order to regain a measure of honor, self- respect, and transcendence in his last moments of consciousness.) After days of painful treatments in the hospital, he is suddenly told that he is recovering, after almost having died of sepsis. Discharged from the hospital, Juan Dahlmann sets off to his estate in the South to convalesce. Riding a taxi at dawn to the train station, Dahlmann regards the awakening city sights with great joy. Having to wait 30 minutes for his departure, he decides to have a bite at a famous cafe near the train station. In the locale, he notices a cat, the mythical creature who, in many cultures (for example, Egypt), is associated with eternity and the gods. After his meal, Dahlmann boards the train and rides out of the city into the plains of the South. He begins to read Arabian Nights but then closes the book to enjoy the scenery. The train conductor enters his compartment and notifies him that the train will not be stopping at his destination, but at a previous station. Once the train reaches the deserted station, Dahlmann steps off into nearly empty fields. He makes his way through the darkened roads to the only watering hole (a typical almac√©n de campo) outside of which he notices Gaucho's horses. He sits down, orders food, and begins to read Arabian Nights. Three peones (farm hands) sitting at a table nearby throw a bread crumb at him, which he ignores. However, after a short while, they begin again. Dahlmann stands up in order to exit the establishment. The shopkeeper (calling him by name) anxiously asks Dahlmann to pay them no heed, saying they are drunk. This prompts Dahlmann to do the opposite; he turns and faces the three locals. One of the toughs or compadritos brandishes a knife. Seeing the situation getting out of hand, the shopkeeper calls out that Dahlmann does not even have a weapon. At this point, an old man in the corner, a gaucho (a figure who, to Dahlmann (and many Argentines) represents the essence of the South, as well as of the country's romanticized past) throws a dagger to Dahlmann. It lands at his feet. As he picks up the blade, Dahlmann realizes that this means he will have to fight, and that he is doomed; he has never wielded a knife in his life and is sure to die in the encounter. However, he feels that his death in a knife fight is honorable, that it is the one he would have chosen when he was sick in the hospital, and he decides to have a go. The narrative switches from past to present tense in the story's final sentence, when Dahlmann and the toughs exit the bar and walk into the endless plain for their confrontation.

It is the opening novel in the Heechee saga, with four sequels that followed (five books overall). Gateway won the 1978 Hugo Award for Best Novel, the 1978 Locus Award for Best Novel, the 1977 Nebula Award for Best Novel, and the 1978 John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. The novel was adapted into a computer game in 1992. Publishing history Gateway was serialized in Galaxy prior to its hardcover publication. A short concluding chapter, cut before publication, was later published in the August 1977 issue of Galaxy.\\"Postscript to Gateway\\". Galaxy, August 1977, pp.30-33. Plot summary Gateway is a space station built into a hollow asteroid constructed by the Heechee, a long-vanished alien race. Humans have had limited success understanding Heechee technology found there and elsewhere in the solar system. The Gateway Corporation administers the asteroid on behalf of the governments of the United States of America, the Soviet Union, New People's Asia, the Venusian Confederation, and the United States of Brazil. There are nearly a thousand small, abandoned starships at Gateway. By extremely dangerous trial and error, humans learn how to operate the ships. The controls for selecting a destination have been identified, but nobody knows where a particular setting will take the ship or how long the trip will last; starvation is a danger. Attempts at reverse engineering to find out how they work have ended only in disaster, as has changing the settings in mid-flight. Most settings lead to useless or lethal places. A few, however, result in the discovery of Heechee artifacts and habitable planets, making the passengers (and the Gateway Corporation) extremely wealthy. The vessels come in three standard sizes, which can hold a maximum of one, three, or five people, filled with equipment and hopefully enough food for the trip. Some \\"threes\\" and many \\"fives\\" are armored. Each ship includes a lander to visit a planet or other object if one is found. Despite the risks, many people on impoverished, overcrowded, starving Earth hope to go to Gateway. Robinette Stetley Broadhead‚Äîknown as Robin, Rob, Robbie, or Bob, depending on circumstances and his state of mind‚Äîis a young food shale miner on Earth who wins a lottery, giving him just enough money to purchase a one-way ticket to Gateway. Once there, he is frightened of the danger and delays going on a mission as long as he can. In the meantime he becomes romantically involved with two different women, eventually settling on Gelle-Klara Moynlin, his co-enabler in fearful delaying. Eventually he starts running out of money, and although he is terrified, he goes out on three trips. The first is unsuccessful and afterwards tension rises between Bob and Klara until they have a fight that suddenly turns into a vicious beating from Bob that seems to stem from repressed homosexuality. On the second trip, he makes a discovery through unauthorized experimentation, but the bonus he is awarded is offset by the large penalty for incapacitating the ship. On his third trip, the Gateway Corporation tries something different: sending two armored five-person ships, one slightly behind the other, to the same destination, one rejected as particularly hazardous by most ship's navigation computers. Bob signs up in desperation, along with Klara, who is struggling with her own fears. When the ships arrive, their crews find to their horror that they are in the gravitational grip of a black hole without enough power to break free. The crews devise a desperate escape plan: Move everyone into one ship and eject the other toward the black hole, thus gaining enough of a boost to escape. Working frantically to transfer unnecessary equipment to make room, Broadhead finds himself alone in the wrong ship when time runs out. He closes the hatch so that the plan can proceed. By chance, his ship is the one that breaks free, leaving the rest of the crew falling into the black hole. Broadhead returns to Gateway alone and receives the entire bonus. He feels enormous survivor guilt for leaving his crewmates, especially Klara, and is unsure whether he intended to sacrifice himself or the others, so once back on Earth as a wealthy man he seeks therapy from an artificial intelligence Freudian therapist program which he names Sigfrid von Shrink. The narrative alternates in time between Broadhead's experience on Gateway and his sessions with Sigfrid, converging on the traumatic moment near the black hole. Sigfrid helps him realize that, due to the gravitational time dilation of the black hole's immense gravity field, time is passing much more slowly for his former crewmates and none of them has actually died yet. Broadhead, however, concludes that this means that they will still be dying when he dies in several decades, with Klara still believing that he betrayed them to save himself. Also embedded in the narrative are various mission reports (usually with fatalities), roster openings, technical bulletins, and other documents Broadhead might have read on Gateway, adding to the verisimilitude. The economic side of living at Gateway is presented in detail, commencing with the contract all explorers must enter into with the Gateway Corporation, and including how some awards are determined. Reception C. Ben Ostrander reviewed Gateway in The Space Gamer No. 12. Ostrander commented that \\"I loved this book. I like books that don't solve big problems, but take care of the characters.\\" TV series In 2015, Variety announced that a Gateway TV series will be written and produced by David Eick and Josh Pate for Syfy with Eick serving as showrunner.

What duration is considered \\"long\\" depends on the academic discipline. For example, several agricultural field experiments have run for more than 100 years, but much shorter experiments may qualify as \\"long-term\\" in other disciplines. An experiment is \\"a set of actions and observations\\", implying that one or more treatments (fertilizer, subsidized school lunches, etc.) is imposed on the system under study. Long- term experiments therefore contrast with nonexperimental long-term studies in which manipulation of the system studied is impossible (Jupiter's Great Red Spot) or undesirable (field observations of chimpanzee behavior). In physics The Oxford Electric Bell has been ringing at Oxford University since 1840, although there is some reason to believe it may be 15 years older. The Beverly Clock at the University of Otago has been running since 1864. The pitch drop experiment has been running at the University of Queensland since 1927. In botany The William James Beal Germination Experiment has been running since 1879. It is the oldest on-going experiment in botany. It is scheduled for completion in 2100. The Godwin Plots experiment at the Wicken Fen reserve in Cambridgeshire, England, has been running since the 1920s and explores the differences between areas of vegetation which are never cut, and respectively all four, three or two years and every year. In agricultural research Broadbalk Experiment Rothamsted Long-term experiments test the sustainability of different farming practices, as measured by yield trends over decades. Examples include the Park Grass Experiment at Rothamsted Experimental Station (1843‚Äìpresent), the Morrow Plots (1876‚Äìpresent) at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, Sanborn Field at the University of Missouri (1888-present), the Magruder Plots (1892‚Äìpresent) at Oklahoma State University, Auburn's Old Rotation (1896‚Äìpresent), and the Haughley Experiment (1939‚Äì1982?). Experiments at Rothamsted showed that \\"grain yields can be sustained (and even increased) for almost 150 years in monocultures of wheat and barley given organic or inorganic fertilizer annually\\". These results show that practices considered unsustainable by some advocates of sustainable agriculture may preserve \\"the ability of a farm to produce perpetually\\", at least under some circumstances. But even if crop diversity in space or time (crop rotation) and organic inputs are not always essential to sustainability, there is abundant evidence from Rothamsted and elsewhere that they are often beneficial. An experiment in alpine pasture has been ongoing in Switzerland at Schynige Platte from the 1920s looking at the human effect on the alpine environment. The Haughley Experiment was noteworthy as a rare example of a long-term experiment in organic farming without external inputs of nutrients. After about 30 years, however, it was decided to start importing manure. There is some disagreement whether a \\"decline in relative yields from the organic section\\" was due to a depletion of soil nutrients. Various short-term experiments have used legumes (in symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia) as a nitrogen source, but good short-term yields do not prove the system is sustainable. The problem is that release of nitrogen from soil organic matter can make up any shortfall of nitrogen from legumes for a decade or more. The Old Rotation showed that nitrogen from legumes can balance nitrogen removed in a harvested crop over the long term. A key point is that the nitrogen in the legumes was not removed, as it would be with a soybean crop, but was plowed under as a green manure. In the Old Rotation, the green manure was grown during the winter to supply nitrogen to a summer crop (cotton); this would be less practical in colder climates. Long-term agricultural experiments that have been started more recently include the Long-Term Research on Agricultural Systems experiments at UC Davis, started in 1993. In biology=In microbiology A photo showing the components of the 500-year microbiology experiment Chroococcidiopsis glass ampoules At the UK Centre for Astrobiology within The University of Edinburgh and at the Institute of Aerospace Medicine with the German Aerospace Centre, Charles Cockell and Ralf M√∂ller established the \\"500-Year Microbiology Experiment\\" that started in July 2014 to study the loss of viability of desiccation-resistant bacteria over long periods. The experiment involves the study of vegetative bacteria (the extreme tolerant cyanobacterium, Chroococcidiopsis sp.) and spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis). The experiment comprises two oak wooden boxes containing duplicate samples, to be kept at the University of Edinburgh and the Natural History Museum. Every two years for the next 24 years, triplicate samples of both organisms contained within glass ampoules will be opened and the number of viable cells enumerated. The first time point was taken in 2014. Within each box, the experiment is duplicated into a reduced and non-reduced background radiation experiment, with one set of samples being kept in a lead box to cut back background radiation, allowing the impact of radiation in combination with desiccation on viability to be studied over long periods. It was motivated by a desire to understand how microbes survive desiccation in deserts, rocks, permafrost and their potential survival in space. The destruction and pathways of degradation of biomolecules will also be studied. In addition to the core experiment, there are a variety of samples including dried agar plates and endoliths for investigation over long periods. One of the wooden boxes was delivered to the Natural History Museum on 27 February 2015, and will be curated within the cyanobacterial collection. In evolutionary biology The experiments of Richard Lenski on evolution of E. coli have been underway since 1988 for more than 50,000 generations. Experiments with the evolution of maize under artificial selection for oil and protein content represent more years, but far fewer generations (only 65). The domesticated silver fox, an ongoing breeding program since 1959 with dramatic results. The \\"Dark Fly\\" experiment started by Syuichi Mori (Kyoto University) in 1954 studies evolution of common fruit fly reared in a constant dark room for 57 years (over 1400 generations). On 2012, the third successor of the experiment Naoyuki Fuse performed the full genome sequencing of the strain, and reported around 5% alterations from the wildlife strain. In ecology The US National Science Foundation supports a number of long-term ecological experiments, mostly in ecosystems that are less directly affected by humans than most agricultural ecosystems are. See LTER. Within the UK the Ecological Continuity Trust works to promote and secure the future of long-term ecological experiments, maintaining a register of experiments where treatments have been applied for a minimum of six years. A number of other areas, sometimes called involuntary parks, can be regarded as long time ecological experiments, because they have been abandoned by humans and returned to near- feral condition. These include areas abandoned for political reasons, such as the Korean Demilitarized Zone, or environmental contamination, such as the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant Exclusion Zone. In medicine and psychology The Framingham Heart Study has been running continuously since 1948. The Grant Study at the Laboratory of Adult Development in the Department of Psychiatry at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a Harvard Medical School affiliate, is conducting a longitudinal study of human adult development, by following two groups of individuals as they age (268 Harvard graduates and 456 males from inner-city Boston). The study has been ongoing since 1937 and is currently the longest running study of adult life ever conducted.

It was completed in 1986 and has 34 floors. The building was designed by John Burgee Architects with Philip Johnson. The building receives its name from its shape and color, which resembles a tube of lipstick. The company that owned the building, Metropolitan 885 Third Avenue LLC, filed for bankruptcy in 2010 after overpaying for the property. Description At three levels the Lipstick Building's wall is set back in response to Manhattan's zoning regulation, which requires the building to recede from the street within its spatial envelope, to increase the availability of light at street level. The result is a form that looks as though it could retract telescopically, though the floor plates are tangential to one another at the rear of the site, at the party wall. The shape, which is unusual in comparison to surrounding buildings, uses less space at the base than a regular skyscraper of quadrilateral footprint would use. This provides more room for the heavy pedestrian traffic along Third Avenue. At the base, the building stands on columns which act as an entrance for a vast post-modern hall. They are two stories high and separate the street from the nine-meter (30 ft) high lobby. Because the elevators and emergency staircases are located to the rear of the building, this area appears hollow. The exterior of the building is a continuous wall of red Imperial granite and stainless steel. The ribbon windows are surrounded by gray frames. In between floors is a thin red band which recalls the red color of lipstick. The curvatures of the building allows light to reflect off the polished stone and stainless surfaces. Notable tenants The building's architects, John Burgee and Philip Johnson, moved their firm there in 1986. In 1991, the two ended their partnership and Johnson moved into a smaller space in the building. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities leased the 17th through 19th floors. Madoff operated his $65 billion Ponzi scheme from the 17th floor, which was occupied by no more than 24 employees. In 2011, an art exhibition occupied the 14th and 15th floors of the building. Participating artists not only brought in their own works and materials, but also used the extant structures and forgotten possessions of the previous tenants to create new art exhibits. The location is now identified as the name building for its largest tenant, international law firm Latham & Watkins. In April 2013, the law firm LeClairRyan consolidated its two New York City offices on the 16th floor. References * * Dirk Stichweh: New York Skyscrapers.

Faraday has since been incorporated full-bore into the DC Universe as a member of the Central Bureau of Intelligence. At one point, he was Nightshade's mentor. In fact, he had a hand in both her and Bronze Tiger being recruited into Task Force X. He has also teamed up with Batman a few times. On two of the occasions he has helped Batman in the capture of Two-Face. One Year Later, he is a member of Checkmate, serving as the Bishop for White Queen Amanda Waller.

According to Stuart Harris in The Place Names Of Edinburgh the \\"Black-\\" in the placename could derive either from the Anglian blaec or Scots blac meaning simply black, and the \\"-hall\\" ending is from the Anglian halh or Scots haugh meaning land beside or in the bend of a river. Blackhall is a mainly residential area with amenities including a library and a small number of shops. Most of the housing in the neighbourhood was constructed in the inter-war period, although the recent housing boom has seen new development on the north east slope of Corstorphine Hill. This development went ahead despite considerable opposition from the local community and an unusual planning quirk which allowed the development to go ahead based on forty-year-old outline permission. Blackhall has numerous community and church-based groups including a bowling club, two Probus Clubs, and a horticultural society. There is a local community council, Craigleith/Blackhall, that serves the area. The local school, Blackhall Primary School, has recently been extended and parts rebuilt, as has the local Royal High School which serves Blackhall.

Equitable remedies were granted by the Court of Chancery in England, and remain available today in most common law jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions, legal and equitable remedies have been merged and a single court can issue either, or both, remedies. Despite widespread judicial merger, the distinction between equitable and legal remedies remains relevant in a number of significant instances. Notably, the United States Constitution's Seventh Amendment preserves the right to a jury trial in civil cases over $20 to cases \\"at common law\\". The distinction between types of relief granted by the courts is due to the courts of equity, such as the Court of Chancery in England, and still available today in common law jurisdictions.See generally, Meagher and Gummow, Equity, Doctrines and Remedies, 3rd ed. Equity is said to operate on the conscience of the defendant, so an equitable remedy is always directed at a particular person, and that person's knowledge, state of mind and motives may be relevant to whether a remedy should be granted or not. Equitable remedies are distinguished from \\"legal\\" remedies (which are available to a successful claimant as of right) by the discretion of the court to grant them. In common law jurisdictions, there are a variety of equitable remedies, but the principal remedies are: # injunctionIn English law, see generally American Cyanimid Co v Ethicon [1975] AC 396See also, . # specific performance # account of profits # rescission # rectification # equitable estoppel # certain proprietary remedies, such as constructive trustsSee generally, Oakley, Constructive Trusts, 2nd ed. # subrogation # in very specific circumstances, an equitable lien.. # equitable compensation # appointment or removal of fiduciary #interpleader #equitable tracing as a remedy for unjust enrichment The two main equitable remedies are injunctions and specific performance, and in casual legal parlance references to equitable remedies are often expressed as referring to those two remedies alone. Injunctions may be mandatory (requiring a person to do something) or prohibitory (stopping them doing something). Specific performance requires a party to perform a contract, for example by transferring a piece of land to the claimant. The award of specific performance requires that the two following criteria must be satisfied:Bryan, Degeling, Donald and Vann, A Sourcebook on Equity and Trusts in Australia, Cambridge University Press pp. 24-31. (i) Common law damages must be an inadequate remedy. For instance, when damages for a breach of contract found in favour of a third party are an inadequate remedy.See generally, Coulls v Bagot's Executor & Trustee Co Ltd (1967) 119 CLR AustLII (ii) No bars to equitable relief prevent specific performance. A bar to relief arises for example, when the court's continuous supervision of the defendant is not feasible.See, . An account of profits is usually ordered where payment of damages would still leave the wrongdoer unjustly enriched at the expense of the wronged party. However, orders for an account are not normally available as of right, and only arise in certain circumstances.Goff & Jones, The Law of Restitution, 4th ed. Rescission and rectification are remedies in relation to contracts (or, exceptionally, deeds) which may become available. Constructive trusts and tracing remedies are usually used where the claimant asserts that property has been wrongly appropriated from them, and then either (i) the property has increased in value, and thus they should have an interest in the increase in value which occurred at their expense, or (ii) the property has been transferred by the wrongdoer to an innocent third party, and the original owner should be able to claim a right to the property as against the innocent third party. Equitable liens normally only arise in very specific factual circumstances, such as unpaid vendor's lien. Equitable principles can also limit the granting of equitable remedies. This includes \\"he who comes to equity must come with clean hands\\" (that is, the court will not assist a claimant who is himself in the wrong or acting for improper motives), laches (equitable remedies will not be granted if the claimant has delayed unduly in seeking them), \\"equity will not assist a volunteer\\" (meaning that a person cannot litigate against a settlor without providing the appropriate consideration, for example, Money) and that equitable remedies will not normally be granted where damages would be an adequate remedy. The most important limitation relating to equitable remedies is that an equitable remedy will not lie against a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. Damages can also be awarded in \\"equity\\" as opposed to \\"at law\\",Mcgregor on Damages, 17th rev ed. and in some legal systems, by historical accident, interest on damages can be awarded on a compound basis only on equitable damages, but not on damages awarded at law.Westdeutsche v Islington BC [1996] AC 669 However, most jurisdictions either have ended this anachronism, or evinced an intention to do so, by modernising legislation. Two versions of the legislation are in force in Australian jurisdiction with one version placing emphasis on \\"commission of a wrongful act\\" and the other omits the reference to wrongdoing.See, Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) s 68 and Supreme Court Act 1986 (Vic) s 38. See also, . The classification of a remedy as equitable has various consequences. For example, equitable remedies may be enforced by contempt,International Union, United Mine Workers of America v.

Remenda has also served as a commentator along with his broadcast partner Randy Hahn for the video games NHL 2K9 and NHL 2K10. Coaching career As a coach, Remenda got his start as a video coordinator for Hockey Canada in the 1980s, providing support for Canada's national team and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association. He served as the coach for the University of Calgary's hockey team for the 1989‚Äì90 season before being hired as an assistant coach for the San Jose Sharks expansion team. Remenda served as an assistant coach for the Sharks from 1991 to 1995, then spent a year as the head coach of the Sharks' minor league affiliate the Kansas City Blades. Broadcasting career After his coaching career, Remenda was offered a job as a broadcast analyst for the Sharks. Remenda started on radio, calling games with long-time Sharks radio announcer Dan Rusanowsky. In 1999, Remenda moved up to the Sharks TV crew, joining announcer Randy Hahn in calling Sharks games. His broadcast work with the Sharks over the years earned Remenda three Northern California Emmy Awards in the \\"On Camera Sports\\" category in 1999, 2001 and 2006. Remenda also hosted Shark Byte, a 30-minute magazine-style show on CSN Bay Area dedicated to a behind the scenes look at the Sharks. Remenda was also active in the Bay Area community during his first stint working with the Sharks organization. He was featured in the team's Reading Is Cool program, reading books to children and also starring alongside team mascot S.J. Sharkie in videos distributed to Bay Area schools. On May 17, 2006, following the Sharks' ouster from the 2006 Stanley Cup Playoffs by the Edmonton Oilers, Remenda and Hahn tearfully wrapped up the telecast by announcing that Remenda would not return to the Sharks broadcast team in 2006‚Äì07. Remenda moved on to host The Drew Remenda Sports Show on News Talk 650 CKOM, a news/talk AM radio station in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The program also airs on News Talk 980 CJME, a news/talk AM radio station in Regina. After leaving the Sharks, Remenda accepted a position with the CBC, where he was frequently the colour commentator alongside play-by-play announcer Don Wittman for NHL broadcasts. When broadcasting Sharks games for the CBC, Remenda would frequently appear on the local Sharks FSN Bay Area telecast with Hahn and Marty McSorley, Remenda's on-air replacement, between periods. Remenda teamed up with Hahn on FSN Bay Area (now NBC Sports California) again during Games 3 and 6 of the Sharks Western Conference semifinal matchup with the Detroit Red Wings when McSorley was unavailable for what the Sharks called \\"personal reasons.\\" The San Jose Mercury News reported on July 3, 2007, that the Sharks had made an offer to Remenda in an effort to lure him back to the team's broadcast booth for the 2007‚Äì08 season. A month later, the San Jose Sharks reported on their Web site that Remenda had agreed to return to the organization as the team's television colour analyst, replacing the departed McSorley. Remenda also started hosting The Drew Remenda Sports Show for Newstalk 650 CKOM and 980 CJME that season. CKOM is based in Saskatoon and CJME is based in Regina. In 2009, The Drew Remenda Sports Show was rebranded Sports Night with Jamie Nye and Drew Remenda. This change saw Drew co-anchor the show with Jamie Nye. In June 2012, Remenda suddenly disappeared from radio for unspecified reasons. The show was renamed \\"Green Zone\\", and was shortened from two hours to one hour. It was later extended to three hours. Jamie Nye still hosts the Green Zone along with Greg Moore, otherwise knows as \\"Wheels\\".

New accounts cannot be created since 2011, but existing accounts can receive new money: the accounts were replaced by Junior ISAs. The UK government introduced the Child Trust Fund with the aim of ensuring every child has savings at the age of 18, helping children get into the habit of saving whilst teaching them the benefits of saving and helping them understand personal finance. The Child Trust Fund scheme was promised in the Labour Party's 2001 election manifestoJulian Le Grand, \\"Implementing Stakeholder Grants: the British Case\\", in Erik Olin Wright (ed, 2003), Redesigning Distribution: basic income and stakeholder grants as alternative cornerstones for a more egalitarian capitalism, The Real Utopias Project, Volume V and launched in January 2005, with children born on or after 1 September 2002 eligible.HM Treasury, 10 January 2005, Chancellor and Minister for Children launch Child Trust Fund Eligible children received an initial subscription from the government in the form of a voucher for at least ¬£250. In 2010/11 the child trust fund policy was expected to cost around ¬£520m, less than 0.5% of the ¬£84bn UK education budget. Because the scheme allows for family and friends to top up trust funds, it has given a substantial boost to savings rates, particularly among the poor. According to the Children's Mutual, \\"In terms of changing people's behaviour, this is the most successful product there's ever been.\\" For households with income of ¬£19,000 a year, 30% of the children in that category are having ¬£19 a month saved for them. Part of this is due to grandparents being more willing to contribute to funds, since the money cannot be diverted to the family finances.Zoe WIlliams, The Guardian, 2 May 2010, Why we cannot afford to raid the child trust fund piggy bank Creation of new funds and government payments into them were ended in January 2011 by the Savings Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grant Act 2010. Background Asset-based egalitarianism traces its roots to Thomas Paine, who proposed that every 21-year-old man and woman receive ¬£15, financed from inheritance tax. In 1989 LSE professor Julian Le Grand proposed a similar idea, calling it a \\"poll grant\\". Subsequently the related concept of Individual Development Accounts was developed in the United States by Michael Sherraden.Washington University in St Louis, Michael Sherraden This approach - termed \\"asset-based welfare\\" by Sherraden - saw asset redistribution less as an egalitarian measure than as one which supported poverty reduction by encouraging saving. Sherraden argued that owning an asset led to people changing their way of thinking, being more likely to plan and invest in their future - in a way that providing people with an equivalent flow of income does not.Rajiv Prakhar (2009), \\"What is the future for asset-based welfare?\\", public policy research, March‚ÄìMay 2009, p52 The idea of a universal account for all children first appears in Sherraden's Assets and the Poor (1991). In the UK the idea took off in 1999/2000 with a number of contributions to the New Statesman in 1999, including an article from Robert Reich endorsing the idea; and support in 2000 by the influential Institute for Public Policy Research.Kelly, Gavin and Lissauer, Rachel Ownership for All. London: Institute for Public Policy Research. Sherraden's Center for Social Development collaborated with the IPPR, and a briefing paper by it remarked \\"It would be impossible to overstate the leadership and contributions of the Institute for Public Policy research in informing and shaping this new policy direction in the United Kingdom\\".Finlayson A (2008), \\"Characterizing New Labour: the case of the Child Trust Fund\\", Public Administration 86(1): 95-110 This carried through into proposals being included in the Labour Party's 2001 election manifesto. The Child Trust Fund scheme was promised in the Labour Party's 2001 election manifesto, and launched in January 2005, with children born after 1 September 2002 eligible. Over the course of the development of the policy up to implementation, it became increasingly focussed on encouraging the poor to save and to develop their financial skills, with less emphasis on the egalitarian redistribution of assets. According to the Institute of Public Policy Research Sherraden argued that possessing wealth in your early adulthood improves life outcomes by its effect of changing attitudes: Political opposition Child trust funds were opposed by the Liberal Democrats in the 2005 general election, and the Liberal Democrats remain opposed. Their policy has been criticised by Stuart White, who notes various historical examples of CTF-like policies proposed by Liberals in the past, and argues that the Child Trust Fund policy \\"gives direct expression to a deep, historic Liberal (and SDP) commitment to the ideal of ‚Äòownership for all‚Äô.\\" He adds that \\"At a time of rising wealth inequality, and widespread asset poverty, the old Liberal slogan of ‚Äòownership for all‚Äô has never been more urgent.\\"Stuart White, \\"Why do Liberal Democrats oppose the Child Trust Fund?\\", public policy research, March‚ÄìMay 2007 In April 2010 Julian Le Grand argued strongly against Conservative Party plans to means test the funds (limiting them to households on below ¬£16,000 per year income), saying that \\"Confining CTFs to the poor would be divisive, and would result in low take-up and stigma. A universal endowment is a badge of citizenship.\\"Julian Le Grand, The Guardian, 27 April 2010, We must not sacrifice the child trust fund He added that if funding had to be cut from the scheme, it would be better to reduce the government's topups, and keep the scheme universal. Details The funds are held in trust for the child until they turn 18, and the money is then theirs to use as they see fit. CTFs are managed by the parents/legal guardians of the child until the child reaches the age of 16. At this point, the child will have the option to take over management of the account including choice of provider and investment decisions. However, they will still not be able to withdraw funds from the account until reaching 18. The government has stated that they will be introducing a programme of education in personal finance in schools to enable 16-year-olds to competently manage their CTF. All of the funds in the account are exempt from income tax and capital gains tax, including at maturity. However, the 10% dividend tax payable on franked income (UK share dividends) cannot be reclaimed. The UK government has stated that at age 18 it will be possible to transfer the entire CTF into an ISA to keep the tax-free status of the investment. If the CTF is withdrawn as cash, the tax benefits will be permanently lost. Vouchers * At birth: The government gave every eligible child a voucher worth ¬£250 to open the account, and also a further ¬£250 directly into the accounts of children who live in low income families. * At age 7: The government would have made an additional payment of ¬£250 into the account, with a further ¬£250 for children in low income families. * At age 11: The government was consulting on the possibility of a further voucher at this age. If vouchers were not invested within one year of issue, HM Revenue and Customs would open a stakeholder account on behalf of the child. Subscriptions by individuals were in addition to any voucher subscriptions. Subscriptions Parents and other family members or friends can pay a maximum per year into their child‚Äôs fund; the year is counted from birthday to birthday, not a tax year. The maximum tax-free limit is subject to change. Currently (tax year 2020/2021) it stands at ¬£9000 per year. Before that it was ¬£4,368 and ¬£4,260 per year. Originally the subscription limit was ¬£1,200, and then from 1 November 2011 the limit was raised to ¬£3,600 and has been increasing gradually each year since then, in line with increases in Junior ISAs. Any gains or dividends will be tax free (except for the 10% tax on UK share dividends). Stakeholder accounts cannot set the minimum contribution above ¬£10, but the provider can set a lower minimum. Eligibility Every child born on or after 1 September 2002 was eligible for the CTF, as long as: * child benefit has been awarded for them; * they are living in the United Kingdom; and * they are not subject to immigration controls The children of Crown servants posted abroad ‚Äì including the Armed Forces ‚Äì qualify because they are treated as being in the UK. Investment options Most advisers recommend equity-based CTFs, and the fact accounts allocated by HM Revenue and Customs are put into stakeholder products indicates that the government also believes equities are the best option over such a long period. *Stakeholder accounts invest in shares, with a set of rules (\\"stakeholder standards\\") to reduce financial risk. These include provision for money in the account being gradually moved to lower risk investments or assets when the child reaches age 13. This is to help to produce a stable return in the run up to the child's 18th birthday. The charge on a stakeholder account is limited to no more than 1.5 per cent a year, whereas charges on all other types of CTF account are not limited in this way. *Savings account. These operate in a similar way to a bank deposit account; there is a rate of interest and the nominal value of the funds is secure. *Non-stakeholder account. Invests funds according to the type of product. These accounts are not protected by the \\"stakeholder standards\\". CTF funds can be transferred between providers. Rules for transfers are similar to those for Individual Savings Accounts ‚Äì customers should inform the new provider they wish to use and they will undertake the move. No penalty or fee can be imposed for transferring the account, except for the cost of selling shares (such as dealing charges) in equity accounts. Abolition On May 24, 2010, the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne MP and Chief Secretary to the Treasury David Laws MP announced that the ¬£250 top up payments into the child trust fund would cease in August 2010, with no payments for newborns from the end of 2010.BBC News: George Osborne outlines detail of ¬£6.2bn spending cuts The Savings Accounts and Health in Pregnancy Grant Act 2010 facilitates the abolition of the fund.

By 1874 Dr. Okell owned many of the pubs on the island, had convinced Tynwald, the island's parliament, to create an act ensuring the purity of beer brewed on the Isle of Man (Isle of Man Pure Beer Act), and built The Falcon Steam Brewery just off Broadway in Douglas. This imposing Building still stands today as Sheridan Apartments. In 1972 Okells was bought by Heron & Brearley, a local drinks company. Then, in 1986, it was merged with Castletown Brewery and H&B; was renamed as The Isle of Man Breweries which later reverted to the name Heron and Brearley In August 1994 Okells moved to a new purpose built brewery built inside the existing Heron & Brearley Warehouse outside Douglas.

Born in Vegreville, Alberta as Simma Milner, the sixth of eight children, she received a Bachelor of Arts degree, with majors in English and Psychology, in 1944 from the University of Manitoba. That same year she began a 30-year career at The Vancouver Sun newspaper as a reporter, feature writer, and columnist.  Journalism  Her interest in journalism began as a child when the sole operator of the Vegriville Observer would welcome her observing his production of the paper. Partly due to male students at the University of Manitoba participating in the Second World War, Holt became the first female managing editor of the student newspaper The Manitoban and university correspondent for the Winnipeg Free Press. On D-Day, her first day using the machine, Holt mistakenly clogged up the teletype machine at the Canadian Press in Calgary. A few months later, she started her career at The Vancouver Sun. At the start of Holt's journalism career, women were rarely employed as professional journalists. She gained reputation as a tough reporter by working in traditionally-male beats such as crime and waterfront reporting. Holt's style was seen as tough advocacy or crusading investigative journalism in potentially-controversial topics such as prostitution. Sexism incidents included coworkers handing her nude photos of women and being told by her editor she would be fired if she again snuck into the male-only Terminal Club to cover a story. During a 1970 strike by Sun employees, Holt was a labour negotiator and vice-president of the Newspaper Guild and actively worked for the Vancouver Express. . In 1996, Holt was also inducted into the Canadian News Hall of Fame ‚Äî the first female journalist in B.C. to receive the distinction.  Politics  Local Senator Ray Perrault engaged Holt with Liberal leader Pierre Elliott Trudeau. Initially, she was critical of Trudeau and had written a story about his wife but became favourable to him after he was willing to accept her criticism. In the 1974 election, Holt was elected to the Canadian House of Commons as the Liberal candidate for the British Columbia riding of Vancouver Kingsway. She was one of only two women representing British Columbia. She was defeated in the 1979 election and the 1980 election. She did not enjoy her leave of absence from journalism to sit in Parliament and face anti-Semitism and anti-feminism. She called Parliament a 'silly old boys' club' and a waste of time. Holt moved to Maple Falls, Washington, and temporarily worked for the campaign for US President George H. W. Bush. In 1981, Holt started a three-year term as a member of the National Parole Board. In 2006, she publicly criticized Vancouver Mayor Sam Sullivan for seeking a court order to remove lengthy protests by Falun Gong from outside the embassy of China on Granville Street.  Recognition  In 1996, Holt was made a Member of the Order of Canada for her \\"lifetime commitment to assisting those suffering from injustice, persecution and poverty\\".  Personal life  In 1949, she married Leon Holt. They remained together but childless until his death in 1985. After purchasing what turned out to be one of Vancouver's notorious \\"leaky condos\\" in 1999, Holt waged a publicly vocal, seven-year legal action seeking financial compensation for repairs.Simma Holt: Rosie the Riveter of Canadian Journalism, Grab News .

It's the final song on their album Isola and was released as third single in 1998 with B-sides \\"Din skugga\\" and \\"Elever\\". It's been recorded both with Swedish and English lyrics. It quickly became a fan favorite, and for eight years, the band always ended their concerts with it. Name, lyrics and theme In its album version, the song is 7 minutes and 47 seconds long, almost half of that as an instrumental outro with characteristic guitar riffs and keyboard melodies. The title is not to be found in the song, and is not a reference to the Boeing 747 airplane even though the lyrics are flight- inspired: the Swedish original, which is slightly different from the English release, describes the narrator and an unidentified second character leaving or escaping something, towards an unknown destination, on a passenger airliner. It closes with a crash scene, moving into the instrumental outro: listening tense & strapped in & when panic erupts you smile faintly and whisper to me you are worth dying for but against rubber, glass & metal a miracle means nothing at all The cover image of the Isola album is an aircraft (in fact, a Boeing 737) which was also used as a backdrop in ensuing concerts. The album name itself is supposed to symbolize New York City, referencing \\"Isola\\" in Ed McBains crime novels. A strange fact is that if you take the full names of each band member, and assign every letter with a number (A = 1, B = 2, C = 3 and so on) and sum it all up, you will get the number 747. The band kept on toying with the number 747: in their 1999 Hagnesta Hill album (the only other album to have an English version), the final song \\"Visslaren\\" (\\"Whistle Song\\" in the English version) also had a length of 7:47. Video A music video was recorded for the English version. In it, the band is playing on a stage with a picture of an airplane as a backdrop.

It is one of the more desirable neighbourhoods of Edinburgh. It is bordered by Wardie to the west and north-west, Newhaven to the north-east, Victoria Park to the east and Bangholm to the south. Origin The plaque from Trinity Mains Farm, Newhaven Main Street The name derives from Trinity House in Leith, which formerly held these lands and had a large estate farm, Trinity Mains, in the area. The coat of arms from the farm is preserved on the gable of a modern block on Newhaven Main Street. Although having some buildings from the 18th century, the area was largely developed in the early 19th century, as a mansion house district, broadly comparable in style to The Grange area of Edinburgh (Trinity is sometimes referred to as Leith's Grange). Many buildings were \\"second homes\\" to rich families in the New Town and were treated as a \\"country retreat\\". The style of housing is now very mixed, as the area has always been seen as desirable, and developers have accordingly been keen to build, usually in the preferred architectural style of their period. Victoria Park adds to the area's amenities as do a large number of cycle paths and walkways derived from the city's disused northern suburban railway lines. East Trinity Road is typical in having property types ranging from original mansions, Victorian terraces and tenements, cottages to modern developments. Craighall Crescent has a Victorian crescent on one side of the street with much later houses on the other side. Buildings of interest The remnant northeast wing of the 15th century Wardie Castle (later Wardie House) survives on Wardie House Lane. This was rebuilt in 1780 by Sir Alexander Boswall who gives his name to Boswall Road. alt=Photograph of Boswall House, built by a Chancellor of the University of Edinburgh Numbers 17 to 23 Boswall Road were built in 1815. The westmost wing (containing a telescope viewing area to the harbour) was his own house. The central and east blocks were built as the Pollock Missionary School. The doorpiece on number 21 seems a later addition to embellish this otherwise plain block. The most notable building on Boswall Road was Wardie Lodge, later renamed Challenger Lodge by Sir John Murray in 1914, after his Challenger Expedition investigating abyssal lifeforms in the deep oceans. After use as a children's home, it was converted to St Columba's Hospice, providing care for the terminally ill, in 1977.St Columba's Hospice: http://www.stcolumbashospice.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=3&Itemid;=73 Although still extant, the original lodge is now subsumed by modern buildings for the hospice. 11 Boswall Road, East Cottage, dates from the 17th century and was a part-time summer home for Professor John Wilson pen-named \\"Christopher North\\". From 1821 to 1898 the Trinity Chain Pier was used by ferries and latterly swimmers. The booking office survives as a pub. Trinity Railway Station still survives, up a lane opposite, but is converted to residential use. Wardie Parish Church is one of several Church of Scotland churches in Trinity. Trinity Academy Old Building Trinity Academy is one of the historic schools of the city but has large modern extensions on its east side. Trinity Cottage (the home of Christian Salvesen) was demolished in 1969)PDF document covering the history of the Scottish NHS Information Services Department and replaced by National Health Service (NHS) offices. It in turn was demolished in 2008 and replaced by modern townhouses.

Plot July 16, 1988 a night train (or \\"red eye\\") to Yeosu leaves Seoul station and crashes killing 250 people. Exactly 15 years later to the day, a train is running the same line for the last time. But it has incorporated some of the coaches from the old crashed train. A stewardess (who manages a drinks and food trolley) named OH Mi-sun (Jang Shin-young) has just started the job and switched shifts with another woman to take that train. Her father was a guard who died on the crashed train 15 years ago and some blamed him for it. She is the main character in this film and, like another young woman named YOON So-hee (Kwak Ji-min) (who is with a group of young people), she has psychic powers (which she did not know about) so gets glimpses of \\"the dead\\" from the earlier train crash who now ride the train with them. Unsettling incidents start to occur and two passengers are murdered by supernatural means. With two dead bodies the train is supposed to stop at a station for the police, but it goes through the station because of a crazy young couple who are intent on crashing the train. They were the two tiny children (brother and sister) who were in the first train crash with their parents. Increasingly strange incidents occur as the lights go out in some carriages and the carriages suddenly look old and in another, lights shatter and glass falls on the passengers. The passengers do not know where to go to escape the coming crash since the back of the train is no longer safe. Mi-Sun tries to stop them from crashing the train. Mi-sun has gained knowledge from contact with a dead form which rose from a black puddle in one of the carriages and tells them that they are both dead, and that they now inhabit the bodies of other people. Also that their father and his wife planned to kill themselves and the children on that train 15 years ago but the poison he was going to use was ruined by a stewardess JUNG Jin-sook (Kim Hyeon-suk) when she accidentally kicked the jar it was in, so he got into the driver's cabin and put the train on a collision course with another train, causing the terrible wreck over a decade ago. In anger the brother smashes Mi- sun's head hard four times against the window causing her to collapse with bleeding to the head but he knows it is true as his sister regresses to a little girl again. Mi-sun's (dead) father comes into the driver's cabin and pilots the train harmlessly through the train that it was on a collision with and the crazy man reverts to a scared child comforting his sister. As the trains, natural and supernatural begin to part, things start getting back to normal on the train with the ghosts disassembling, the old carriages becoming normal again and the human passengers start coming out of hiding. Mi-sun's father comforts her as she dies from her injuries. The train is finally stopped and it is daylight and the bewildered people get off. The scene changes to night again and the train for Yeosu arrives in Seoul station for its last run. We see Mi-sun on the platform, and she is again a stewardess on this train on its unnatural journey. The white end titles are rolled up against a night background that a driver would see from the cabin of the train.

Life Faber was born in Altom√ºnster, in Bavaria. He received Holy Orders and became pastor of the Parish of St. Maurice in Ingolstadt, where he became a professor at the University of that city. He gained such a great reputation that he was appointed to serve as a Canonical Visitor to examine the Prince-bishopric of Eichst√§tt. His sermons had already won for him a reputation as a sacred orator when he entered the Society of Jesus at Vienna in 1637. He was then already fifty years old. Faber joined the faculty of the Jesuit university in Tyrnau (which became the University of Budapest), then in the Kingdom of Hungary, now Trnava in Slovakia. It was there that he died in 1653. Works Faber published a three-volume collection of his sermons in 1631, entitled the Concionum opus tripartitum, ... argumentis in singula evangelia festorum, dominicarum hyemalium & aestivalium instructum, providing ten sermons for every Sunday of the year. It was reprinted several times, both in Germany and in the Netherlands, over the next twenty years. The sermons which Faber has left are remarkable for the clarity of their Catholic doctrine and learning. He is even more a controversialist than orator in the ordinary sense of the word. The goal of his preaching was, before everything, polemical, either to convert non-Catholics or to safeguard Catholics from the Protestant Reformation. According to the custom of the times, Faber made exhaustive use of Scriptural texts, which overwhelm his instructive sermons and render the reading of them difficult. They are all written in Latin, and have been published in many editions. After his admission to the Jesuits, Faber continued his sermon writing and published another volume of sermons, this one for all Sundays and major feast days of the day. The work, entitled the Auctuarium, is divided into two parts, and was published in combination with his earlier work. The Concionum opus tripartitum, combined with the Auctuarium, contain one thousand and ninety-six sermons. Besides these, he preached sermons at funerals and weddings, which were published after his death. In Faber's one of the sermons in his published collection, he treated the topic of \\"curiosity\\", a popular one in that period. It was one of eight sermons he provided for the Feast of St. John the Evangelist, reflecting on the Gospel passage of John 21:22. He divided curiosity into five directions, based upon the object of the curiosity. These sermons were referred to approvingly by Lutheran writers as late as 1690.

The village is located just off the A9 between Perth and Stirling which has been bypassed since 1978. It is home to Highland Spring water and the Tullibardine whisky distillery. History Blackford was first known as a ford over the Allan Water. There is a legend that a King Magnus lost his wife Queen Helen in a storm and she is buried on a nearby hill. Blackford became a popular stopping place especially when Scotland's first public brewery was started. James VII of Scotland even stopped in Blackford while travelling to sample their ale. The village was becoming more prosperous by the nineteenth century with manufacturing including two breweries and with a healthy agricultural sector based on wool and flax. The Scottish Central Railway built a line between Perth and Stirling with a station at Blackford in 1848. Local manufacturing declined at the beginning of the 20th century with many people leaving the village. However, many people in the village were employed when the Gleneagles Hotel was opened nearby in 1924. The Tullibardine distillery was built on the site of the former Sharp's Brewery. Carsebreck, near Blackford hosted 25 Grand Matches in curling, between 1853-1935. \\"A piece of ground which could be flooded for the purpose of affording a safe sheet of ice\\" was leased from Mrs Home Drummond Stirling Moray of Abercairney, at a rental of ¬£15 for from November to February each season.
