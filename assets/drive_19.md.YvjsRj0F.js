The game is set in the medieval Kingdom of Gallowmere and centres around the charlatan protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque, as he makes an attempt to stop antagonist Zarok's invasion of the kingdom whilst simultaneously redeeming himself. Development began in 1995 at Millennium Interactive in Cambridge under the working title of Dead Man Dan. The visuals are heavily influenced by Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Originally conceived as an arcade-style shooter for platforms such as Windows and the Sega Saturn, Sony's purchase of SCE Cambridge Studio evolved the game into a PlayStation title. The game received mostly positive praise from critics upon release, with praise including its blend of Halloween themed visuals, but was criticised for its controls and cumbersome camera work. It was released in Europe and North America in 1998, and in Japan in 1999. It was also re- released on the PlayStation Network in 2007. It was followed by a sequel, MediEvil 2, in 2000, and a PlayStation Portable remake in 2005 titled MediEvil: Resurrection. A PlayStation 4 remake was released on 25 October 2019, to enhance the graphics and experience of gameplay.  Gameplay  The first level The game takes place across a variety of levels, many of which require certain objectives to be performed to progress. Sir Daniel Fortesque can use a variety of weapons, consisting of close range weapons such as swords and clubs to long range weapons such as crossbows. Many can be charged for a powerful attack and some, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, Dan is able to rip his arm off and use it for both melee and ranged attacks. Dan can equip a shield alongside weapons for defence, but shields have a limited amount of strength and are therefore best used sparingly. Throughout the game, Dan can visit gargoyle heads of two varieties: green ones offer Dan information while blue ones allow Dan to buy services or ammunition by using the treasures he finds. Dan's health is determined by a health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan runs out of health, the game will end. Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that replenish Dan's health and fill any empty Life Bottles Dan has. In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls which can be collected if the player has dispatched enough enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means). Certain enemies have no soul and therefore do not count while the levels \\"The Sleeping Village\\" and \\"The Haunted Ruins\\" include NPCs with \\"good souls\\" that will reduce the Chalice percentage if killed. If the player clears a level with a Chalice in hand, Dan is warped to the Hall of Heroes, where he can speak to a hero who will give him rewards, such as weapons. If the player finishes the game with all the Chalices, the true ending is revealed.  Plot  In the year 1286, an evil sorcerer named Zarok plotted to take over the kingdom of Gallowmere with his undead army. It is told in legend that the champion, Sir Daniel Fortesque, led the King of Gallowmere's army to victory and managed to kill Zarok before he succumbed to his mortal wounds.Strategy Guide, p. 6. In reality, however, Dan was struck down by the first arrow fired in the battle, with the king choosing to cover it up and declare Dan the \\"Hero of Gallowmere\\". Zarok, meanwhile, went into hiding. 100 years later, Zarok reappears, casting a spell over Gallowmere to plunge it into eternal night, awaken his undead army and steal the souls of the living. However, in the process, he unwittingly revives Dan, who has over time become a skeletal corpse, missing his jaw which fell off and the left eye he lost in the battle of Gallowmere. Having been unable to ascend to the fabled Hall of Heroes for his ignoble death, Dan uses this opportunity to defeat Zarok, save Gallowmere and earn his place as a true hero.Strategy Guide, pp. 8-111. As Dan travels across Gallowmere, fighting his way through Zarok's hordes and confronting all manner of beasts, he soon arrives at Zarok's lair, fighting off Zarok's skeletal personal guard using the souls of his old allies retrieved by collecting the Chalices. After also managing to defeat Zarok's champion, Lord Kardok, (who also died from being struck in the eye in the battle of Gallowmere by Dan's crossbowman and second in command, Canny Tim) Zarok turns into a powerful monster, but Dan manages to defeat him.Strategy Guide, pp. 110,111. As Zarok uses his last breath to cause his lair to collapse in an attempt to take Dan with him (inadvertently crushing himself in the process), Dan escapes and Zarok's magical influence over the land is thwarted, thus restoring the souls back to the living and putting the dead back to rest. With the magic cast on him also wearing off as a result, Dan returns to his burial chamber where he once again enters eternal slumber. If the player has managed to collect all the Chalices, Dan will ascend to the Hall of Heroes, where he is hailed as the rightful Hero of Gallowmere.Strategy Guide, p. 111.  Development Development of MediEvil began in late 1995 at independent developer Millennium Interactive in Cambridge. Chris Sorrell, previously known for the James Pond series of games, created the original concept for MediEvil and served as the game's creative director. Sorrell joined Millennium, with whom he had been working with for a while, after completing James Pond 3. When asked what he wanted to do, he said he wanted to work with someone on the visual side. Jason Wilson, who would be the designer and a writer for the game, met up with Sorrell and began working on MediEvil. According to Sorrell, the first design proposal for the game had the working title ‘Dead Man Dan’ and described a game that was initially a fusion of Capcom's Ghost'n Goblins combined with the art style of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. As development progressed, lead artist Wilson pushed the game into more of a Zelda role playing game-influenced direction as opposed to the original arcade-style concept. Looking to attract a major publishing deal, Millennium Interactive initially began working on multiple platforms including Windows and the Sega Saturn before giving Sony of Europe a working demo of the game. Impressed by the progress, Sony signed MediEvil to be an exclusive PlayStation game and commissioned SCE Cambridge Studio as Sony's second studio in the United Kingdom, after Psygnosis. During the production of the demo, there was a programmer for each platform. Millennium was having financial difficulties and wanted to secure a publisher quickly. Sega and Microsoft were also interested in the game. SCE Cambridge wanted the game to possess a unique lead character, thus Sorrell worked with script doctor Martin Pond whilst creating an expansive backstory for the lead protagonist, Sir Daniel Fortesque. Pond came up with the idea that Sir Daniel could have been a pompous failure in life whose reincarnation was his one shot at redemption. This idea, along with the player-character's unusual appearance, turned appealing to some sectors of the gaming community, as lead designer Wilson later recalled that female gamers considered Sir Daniel to be endearing, and was considered a sex symbol in France. Sony's acquisition of SCE Cambridge (which occurred within six months of Sony agreeing to publish the game) helped ease financial strain on the project, but did not assist the studio's inexperience with making 3D games. The takeover was also \\"quite intimidating\\" to Sorrell and Wilson, who had not held conferences. Sorrell stated the concept of conferences was \\"totally alien\\". He felt that the game started to feel like a major project after a few meetings. Sorrell admitted in a retrospective interview that MediEvil presented \\"a mountain of challenges\\", since they, as many other developers at the time, were new to 3D gaming. He also admitted that some members of the team spent long nights without sleeping in order to finish the game on time. He described it as \\"a huge learning project\\" for the team. During development, the Cambridge team played beta versions of successful platformers such as Super Mario 64 and Crash Bandicoot which helped them understand how they might solve some challenges in building a 3D action game for the first time. Sony requested that MediEvil should support the PlayStation analogue controller, which Sorrell described as a \\"particularly fortuitous event\\" as it allowed them to capture much more fluidity and intuitiveness within the game. New concepts such as camera and character control presented many drawbacks and required the team to try out a number of approaches before settling on solutions that seemed to work. The team finally settled on the concept that MediEvil would support both analogue and digital camera-related controls for balance reasons. Sorrell stated that a spline camera view was the first attempt, but he disliked it due to the lack of freedom for the player to feel as if he was exploring. It was then changed to a free-form camera view, which \\"just worked\\". There were also many levels and ideas from the original concept that the team were forced to remove due to time or budget constraints. There was intended to be a platform-oriented section of the game where the player would control the worm that lived in Daniel's skull. Concept art and a separate level was created for this section, but it never materialised into the game. Humour drove the game forward for Sony Cambridge Studio. Jokes were reflexions on how the team operated. Sorrell explained that the humour was a \\"happy accident\\", and that he used it only when he thought it appropriate. Wilson said that the team were \\"youthful and silly\\", and they liked horror films and comedy. He thought the humour was \\"a natural extension of our personalities\\". Paul Darrow voiced the character of Zarok  Music  The original soundtrack of the game was composed by Paul Arnold and Andrew Barnabas, the musical duo more commonly known as \\"Bob & Barn\\". SCE Cambridge instructed them to compose a Danny Elfman-influenced score, similar to those of Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Batman Returns. The music was created using electronic synthesisers to simulate an entire orchestra and organ. The 2005 PlayStation Portable re- imagining MediEvil: Resurrection used parts of the MediEvil score, along with original elements composed by Bob & Barn that was performed by a live orchestra and choir. An album was made from this music and signed copies can be purchased from the artists' website. Marketing and release Sorrell explained that, during the marketing campaign, the team were frequently asked to go to graveyards for photo-shoots. These usually went without incident, but on one occasion a vicar asked them why they were filming on church property. They lied by telling him that they were students filming a documentary on churches. Marketing campaigns also incorporated Sony Cambridge Studio's humour. MediEvil was first released in North America and Europe in October 1998. The Japanese version, titled MediEvil: Yomigaetta Gallowmere no Yūsha, was released on 17 June 1999. The character of Fortesque proved unpopular there, because they considered the idea of a skeleton being the protagonist strange. The game was later released with C-12: Final Resistance in a two-disc pack on 9 May 2003. It was also re-released on the PlayStation Network in 2007. In 2011, MediEvil was ported to Android, although it is only compatible with PlayStation-certified devices such as the Sony Xperia Play.  Reception  The game received positive reviews from critics upon release. It received an aggregate score of 80 percent from GameRankings and was mostly praised for its Halloween-influenced atmosphere by many critics. IGN's Chris Roper praised the game's sense of humour and unique presentation, but was skeptical about the game's \\"sloppy\\" controls and disjointed level designs, noting that the game's graphics did not age well over time as compared to the PSP remake which offered superior graphics and gameplay. Game Revolution similarly praised the humour but criticised the game for being too straightforward and \\"easy to master\\", noting that the graphics and gameplay were slightly inferior to that of Banjo-Kazooie, Edges reviewer believed the game is \\"well crafted in some respects, underdeveloped in others\\": the \\"ingenious\\" feel was praised, but many levels were felt to be simple cases of maze navigation. The reviewer of Computer and Video Games criticised the game's repetitiveness, but said it \\"looks nice, and plays OK\\". The reviewer of Next Generation liked the dark humour, but complained about the camera, saying it does not smoothly keep up with the character. The conclusion was that MediEvil merely repeated what had already been done. Joysticks reviewer thought that MediEvil would be a new whim for players. The music and atmosphere were the mostly praised aspects of the game. Many reviewers compared the visuals to be similar to Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, Joe Fielder of GameSpot credited MediEvil for its original look and number of unique puzzles, but criticised the camera work, summarising that a \\"tighter camera control\\" would have been a necessity. Randy Nelson of IGN considered the game to be a homage to Capcom's Ghosts & Goblins, stating that the game took too many inspirations from others and not enough innovation was put into it to make it \\"unique\\". Nelson praised the environment of the game but considered the gameplay to be best suited for \\"a mindless hack-'n-slash romp\\". The Android version was described as \\"rather expensive\\" by Damien McFerran of Know Your Mobile, but he praised the humour and the amount of content, which he said made the game stand out from other 3D action games on Android. Sales The game has been re-released as a \\"PlayStation Platinum\\" title in 1999, meaning it sold at least 400,000 copies in Europe. Remakes * In 2005, a \\"reimagining\\" was released on the PlayStation Portable under the title MediEvil: Resurrection. The gameplay is similar, but there are several additional minigames and plot elements. * An eponymous PlayStation 4 remake was released on 25 October 2019.

Meteor allows for rapid prototyping and produces cross-platform (Android, iOS, Web) code. It integrates with MongoDB and uses the Distributed Data Protocol and a publish–subscribe pattern to automatically propagate data changes to clients without requiring the developer to write any synchronization code. On the client, Meteor can be used with any popular front-end JS framework, Vue, React, Svelte, Angular, or Blaze. Meteor is developed by Meteor Software. The startup was incubated by Y Combinator and received $11.2M in funding from Andreessen Horowitz in July 2012. Meteor raised an additional $20M in Series B funding from Matrix Partners, Andreessen Horowitz and Trinity Ventures. It intends to become profitable by offering Galaxy, an enterprise-grade hosting environment for Meteor applications.  History  Having been in development for about 8 months, Meteor was initially released in December 2011 under the name Skybreak. By April 2012, the framework was renamed Meteor and officially launched. During the next few months, and with the help of large investments from Andreessen Horowitz and endorsements from high-profile figures in the startup world, Meteor steadily increased its user base and became more commonly used in production apps and websites. Particularly after receiving large amounts of venture capital in its Series B funding round, Meteor acquired and integrated several other startups into its core product. Acquisitions have included FathomDB, a cloud database startup, Galaxy, a cloud platform for operating and managing Meteor applications, and Kadira, a performance monitoring solution. Meteor has successfully monetized its userbase: In 2016, Meteor beat its own revenue goals by 30% by offering web hosting for Meteor apps through Galaxy. From 2016 the Meteor Development Group (the open source organisation powering Meteor) started working on a new backend layer based on GraphQL to gradually replace their pub/sub system, largely isolated in the whole node.js ecosystem: the Apollo framework. In October 2019, the Meteor.js open source framework and Galaxy Hosting Products were purchased by Tiny Capital and renamed Meteor Software. Distributed Data Protocol Distributed Data Protocol (or DDP) is a client-server protocol for querying and updating a server-side database and for synchronizing such updates among clients. It uses the publish-subscribe messaging pattern. It was created for use by the Meteor JavaScript framework. The DDP Specification is located on GitHub.

Life and career Born Cacilda Becker Iaconis, she was the daughter of Italian immigrants, Edmondo Iaconis and Alzira Becker. She had two sisters. One was Cleyde Yáconis, who also became an actress. Her parents' marriage broke up when she was nine years old and her mother was forced to raise the three daughters alone. They settled in the city of Santos. Being the daughter of divorced and poor parents Cacilda could not establish friendships with people of high society, and instead began to frequent the bohemians and avant- garde circles in the city. Cacilda started as an actress in amateur theater groups and turned professional in 1948. That year, Nydia Lycia turned down a role in the play \\"Mulher do Próximo\\" (Women's Next) by Abilio Pereira de Almeida, produced by the Brazilian Comedy Theater (TBC) to not have to kiss or say \\"lover\\" in the scene, because this could cost you employment at a major store. Cacilda, who replaced her, demanded to be hired as a professional, ending the old prejudice that serious artist should be dilettante In 30 years of career, Cacilda performed in 68 plays staged in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo; made two films (\\"Luz dos Seus Olhos\\" - Light in Their Eyes - in 1947 and in \\"Floradas na Serra\\" - Sierra Blossoms - in 1954) and a soap opera (\\"Ciúmes\\" - Jealousy, 1966). On TV Tupi besides participating in teleteatros, Cacilda inaugurated the Teatro Municipal de São Carlos with the play Waiting for Godot in early 1969. Cacilda overwhelming passions aroused and had three husbands, the latter Walmor Chagas, who adopted her only daughter, Maria Clara Chagas Becker, born in 1964. Death Cacilda suffered a stroke on May 6, 1969 in São Paulo during the presentation of the play Waiting for Godot, staged with her husband Walmor Chagas. She was taken to the hospital still wearing the clothes of her character. She died after 38 days in a coma and was buried in the Cemetery of Araçá, attended by a crowd of admirers. In popular culture Cacilda Becker has already been portrayed as a character in film and television, played by Camila Morgado in the miniseries \\"Um Só Coração\\" (One Heart) (2004) and Ada Chaseliov in the film \\"Brasilia 18%\\" (2006).

Construction and commissioning Vesper, the first Royal Navy ship of the name, was ordered on 30 June 1916 as part of the 9th Order of the 1916–17 Naval Programme. She was laid down on 7 December 1916 by Stephen's of Govan, Glasgow, and launched on 15 December 1917. She was completed on 20 February 1918. Service history World War I Vesper joined the fleet for service during World War I, and remained in service after the 11 November 1918 Armistice with Germany that ended the war, but later was decommissioned and placed in reserve. World War II =1939-1942= Vesper was recommissioned in 1939. After the United Kingdom entered World War II in September 1939, she was assigned to convoy defence and patrol duties in the Southwestern Approaches through December 1939. From January through April 1940, she performed similar duties in the English Channel and North Sea. On 14 February 1940 she and the destroyer rescued 72 survivors of the British merchant ship Sultan Star, which the German submarine had sunk southwest of the Scilly Isles at position . In May 1940, Vesper was deployed with the 19th Destroyer Flotilla to Harwich, England, and assigned to the support of the evacuation of troops from France. On 10 May 1940 she carried a demolition party to Ymuiden in the Netherlands in Operation XD to destroy oil tanks there to prevent their capture by advancing German Army forces, and on 14 May 1940 she took part in Operation Ordnance, the evacuation of forces from the Hook of Holland. During June 1940, deployed with her destroyer flotilla to Dover and provided gunfire support to the retreating British Expeditionary Force at Le Tréport, France. Vesper was reassigned to the 21st Destroyer Flotilla at Sheerness in July 1940 for anti-invasion patrol and convoy escort duties in the English Channel and North Sea, which she continued until December 1940. She and the destroyer rescued 111 survivors of the British merchant ship Beignon, which the German submarine had sunk 300 nautical miles west of Ushant at position . On 13 September 1940 she joined the destroyer leader and escort destroyer in an anti-invasion patrol off the coast of the Netherlands and to bombard Ostend, Belgium, but poor visibility prompted cancellation of the bombardment. On 8 October 1940 she towed the escort destroyer to safety at Sheerness after Hambledon detonated a naval mine in the English Channel off South Foreland at position and suffered severe damage.uboat.net HMS Hambledon (L 37) In December 1940, Vesper was assigned to duty in the Western Approaches and steamed to the River Clyde. From there, she departed on 19 December 1940 with the destroyers and to provide local escort to Convoy WS 5A. The three ships detached from the convoy on 21 December 1940 and returned to the Clyde. For the next two years, Vesper continued her duties in the Western Approaches. On 19 June 1941, she towed the destroyer to safety after Vanessa suffered heavy damage from a bomb hit amidships while under attack by German aircraft and collided with the naval trawler . Vesper herself collided with the destroyer on 31 August 1942.

After passing her post-conversion acceptance trials, she steamed to Tobermory, Isle of Mull, in August 1943 for work-ups. In September 1943 she joined the 2nd Escort Group for convoy escort duty in the North Atlantic Ocean, which she carried out until January 1944, when she was transferred to the 6th Escort Group for convoy escort work in the Western Approaches. In February 1944 she joined the destroyers and , the frigate , the corvettes and , and the Royal Norwegian Navy corvettes , , and as the escort of Convoy ONS 29, which two German Junkers Ju 88 aircraft attacked on 14 February 1944. In April 1944, Vesper was chosen to take part in Operation Neptune, the assault phase of the upcoming invasion of Normandy, scheduled for early June 1944, as a part of Escort Group 112 in Western Task Force O. She joined Force O in May 1944 and participated in pre-invasion exercises that month. In early June 1944 she joined the other ships of Force O at Portland, England, and on 5 and 6 June deployed to defend convoys bound for the 6 June assault at Omaha Beach. She joined the naval trawlers and on 7 June 1944 to form Escort Group 142, which escorted Convoy EBC 1 – consisting of 23 pre-loaded coasters and an armament stores ship – to the Normandy beachhead that day. From 8 June 1944 she operated from the assembly area at Milford Haven, Wales, in the defense of convoys transporting reinforcements and supplies to the beachhead until Operation Neptune came to an end in the latter part of June 1944. Vesper served on convoy escort duty in the English Channel from July through September 1944, then operated on convoy defense duties in waters around the British Isles until the surrender of Germany in early May 1945. During the Second World War Vesper was adopted by the town of Skipton as part of Warship Week. The plaque from this adoption is held by the National Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth.Warship Weeks: Adopting Naval Vessels in World War Two  Royal Naval Museum at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard Decommissioning and disposal After Germanys surrender, Vesper did not deploy operationally, and she soon was decommissioned and placed in reserve, being no longer included on the Royal Navys July 1945 active list. She was sold to BISCO on 7 March 1947 for scrapping by Thos W Ward, and arrived at the shipbreakers yard in March 1948.

Distribution of this group of alkaloids is essentially limited to plant family Rutaceae. The simplest member of this group is dictamnine and most widespread member is skimmianine. A furoquinoline alkaloid, dictamnine, is very common within the family Rutaceae. It is the main alkaloid in the roots of Dictamnus albus and responsible for the mutagenicity of the drug derived from crude extracts. Dictamnine was also reported to be a phototoxic and photomutagenic compound. It participates in the severe skin phototoxicity of the plant. Another furoquinoline alkaloid, skimmianine, has strong antiacetylcholinesterase activity. Chemistry Thomas first isolated dictamnine from Rutaceae in 1923. It is very weak base, shows similar reaction with methyl iodide and dimethyl sulfate or diazomethane, does not form a derivative but go through isomerization to isodictamnine. Dictamine have linear structure which is confirmed as it forms dictamnic acid by oxidative degradation with potassium permanganate. Dieckmann cyclization followed by methylation and hydrolysis confirmed the structure of the acid. Skimmianine, another common furoquinoline alkaloid also shows a very similar type of chemistry to dictamine. Skimmianine also has a linear structure as it gave 3-ethyl-4,7,8-trimethoxy-2-quinolone from hydrolysis. Pharmacological properties Some furoquinoline alkaloids have been found to have in vitro pharmacological properties such as antimicrobial, antiviral, mutagenic and cytotoxic activities. They also show antiplatelet aggregation, inhibition of various enzymes, antibacterial, and antifungal activity. Dictamnine has the property of causing smooth muscle contraction. Skimmianine, extracted from Esenbeckia leiocarpa Engl. (Rutaceae), a native tree from Brazil popularly known as guarantã, show acetylcholinesterase inhibition. Furoquinoline alkaloids extracted from Teclea afzelii (Rutaceae) plants, collected at Elounden, centre province of Cameroon, have antiplasmodial activities. Another study shows that some furoquinoline alkaloids have in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum, one of the species of Plasmodium that causes malaria in humans. One furoquinoline alkaloid, 5-(1,1-dimethylallyl)-8-hydroxy- furo[2-3-b]quinolone, shows antifungal properties against Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotium rolfsi, and Fusarium solani. These fungi cause root-rot and wilt diseases in potato, sugar beet and tomato. Spectral properties For UV spectra an intense band is observed at 235 nm and very broad band in region 290-335 nm. Compared to UV, IR spectra shows less characteristics: 1090–1110 cm−1 region shows a band but don’t indicate a particular vibration. NMR spectroscopy is the best way to observe the structure of furoquinoline alkaloids. C-2 proton gives response in 7.50-7.60 ppm region and C-3 proton gives response in 6.90-7.10 ppm region. Aromatic methoxy group give responses in 4.0-4.2 ppm region but 4-methoxy group give responses in ~4.40 ppm region.

In 1178, Berenguer arbitrated a dispute between King Alfonso II of Aragon and Berenguer de Fluvià over rights at the castle of Forès.Kosto, Making Agreements, 245–46. He supervised for a time the comital administration in the counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne on behalf of Alfonso II, who was also count there. He was perhaps also in charge of the coinage of Catalonia in 1182–85.Thomas N. Bisson, Fiscal Accounts of Catalonia under the Early Count-Kings (1151–1213), vol. 1 (University of California Press, 1984), 93. Assassination Berenguer was assassinated by a relative, Guillem Ramon I de Montcada, his niece's husband. In a letter to the suffragans of Tarragona, Pope Celestine III detailed the crime, especially heinous because proprius homo fuisset archiepiscopi, \\"he was the arhcbishops' man\\", i.e. vassal. The assassination was part of an ongoing dispute between two Catalan factions. In 1190, in a sirventes, \\"Un sirventes ai en cor a bastir\\", the troubadour Guillem de Berguedà accused the king of not accepting him into his company in order to please the archbishop of Tarragona. By that time Berenguer \\"appeared in the eyes of the partisans of the Cabrera–Castellbò band as the principal inspiration in royal politics.\\"John C. Shideler, A Medieval Catalan Noble Family: The Montcadas, 1000–1230 (University of California Press, 1983). No action, either by the king or by the clergy was taken against Guillem Ramon for ten months after the murder. But at that point he went into exile. He did not return until he inherited the viscounty of Béarn from his brother, Gaston VI, in 1214. In September 1215 he prepared his will and then went to Rome to seek absolution. Pope Innocent III delegated his case to three cardinals—Nicholas of Tusculum, Pelayo of Albano and Ugolino of Ostia—who imposed a strict penance on him.Damian J. Smith, \\"Pope Innocent III and the Minority of James I\\", Anuario de estudios medievales, 30:1 (2000), 44. References Further reading *Coll i Alentorn, M. La Llegenda de Guillem Ramon de Montcada.

Four detainees suspected of murdering a former Kopassus sergeant were killed in the attack. The National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) investigated and concluded that the attack had been a human rights violation, though this was disputed by Defense Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro.  Raid  Four men--Hendrik Angel Sahetapi, Adrianus Candra Galaga, Yohanes Juan Mambait and Gamaliel Yermiayanto Rohi Riwu--were being held at Cebongan Prison in Sleman, Yogyakarta on suspicion of having murdered former Kopassus First Sergeant Heru Santoso in a Yogyakarta café with a broken bottle. Yohanes was reported to be an officer with the Yogyakarta police. Santoso's murder took place on 19 March 2013, and the suspects were transferred to Cebongan on 22 March. The prison's chief warden, Sukamto Harto, later stated that he had been planning to return to the detainees to the police station after learning of their crime, fearing a military raid in retaliation. At 12:30 a.m. on 23 March 2013, a group of armed men in masks arrived at the prison gate claiming to be police detectives and demanding to see the four. They then forced their way into the prison at gunpoint, disabling the CCTV cameras, cutting the phone service, and securing the perimeter. The prison officers were ordered to take the gunmen to the four's holding cell; one guard who refused to comply with the instructions was beaten. Other inmates along the route were threatened. When the gunmen reached the cell, they executed the four suspects with shots to the head. Seven prison officers were injured during the attack.  Investigation  Law and Human Rights Minister Amir Syamsuddin visited the prison the day of the murders and announced an investigation. Deputy Law and Human Rights Minister Denny Indrayana stated that due to the coordination of the attack, it appeared likely that the attackers had military backgrounds. On 5 April 2013, a group of Kopassus members confessed to the attack, stating that it had been a revenge killing for Santoso's death. The military stated that 11 men had participated, while Komnas HAM put the number at 14. In its report on the incident, Komnas HAM ruled that the attack had included various human rights violations, including the torture of guards and the intimidation of inmates. Defense Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro disputed the findings, stating, \\"This is not human rights violation, I want to be firm on this ... It is not a genocide incident ... It was a spontaneous action from military members. There was no systemic order from their superiors on this crime.\\" Human rights groups criticized Purnomo's statement; Commission for Missing Persons and Victims of Violence member Yati Andriyani stated that the authority to make this determination rested solely with Komnas HAM, not with the defense minister.  Trial  Eleven members of the Kopassus were charged for their roles in the attack. Despite calls for the trial to be held in a civilian court, Purnomo ruled that the case would be tried in military prison but open to the public.

Rojas returned from injury for the 2011 season where he helped the team reach third place which meant a promotion playoff to Allsvenskan against Allsvenskan 14th placed team Syrianska FC. An injury prevented him from participating in the matches. Ängelholm won the first game 2-1, but Syrianska won the return leg with 3-1 and remained in Allsvenskan.

Founded in 1960, its stated purpose is to examine orders of chivalry to determine their legitimacy. Its President since 1999 is Dr. Pier Felice degli Uberti, and its seat is situated in Milan, Italy. During the Congress of Madrid (1955), Vicente de Cadenas y Vicent thought that it was appropriate to create a commission of scholars on chivalric matters. This idea was instituted during the 5th International Congress of Genealogical and Heraldic Sciences in Stockholm, Sweden, under the protection of Swedish Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland (with State Herald of Sweden Gunnar Scheffer as General Secretary), by decision of the Commission for State Heraldry chaired by Alessandro Monti della Corte with the purpose of creating a provisional list of orders whose approval had to be submitted to the next Congress. Initially, notably in 1964-1999, the organisation was embroiled in several controversies caused by the different cultural training of its commissioners. The root of some of these controversies stems from the unavoidable bias inherent in the ICOC's governing structure as a private, non-governmental organization. The Commission as a private body lacks any legal jurisdiction to unilaterally declare anything other than what amounts to a private opinion. Since its foundation, it has had a number of Patrons, with honorary function without the right to vote, notably including Archduke Otto von Habsburg, Cardinal Pio Laghi, Patron Cardinal of Sovereign Military Order of Malta, Cardinal Giuseppe Caprio, Grand Master emeritus of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, and Maria Vladimirovna, Grand Duchess of Russia, among others. In order to avoid any conflict of interest, the commissioners who hold important offices in a particular order of chivalry cannot participate in the decision regarding that order. The ICOC's most recent Register and Provisional List of Orders was published in 2016. History  Formation and early history  The International Commission for Orders of Chivalry (ICOC) was founded at the fifth International Congress of Genealogical and Heraldic Sciences in Stockholm, Sweden, under the protection of Swedish Prince Bertil, Duke of Halland, with State Herald of Sweden Gunnar Scheffer as General Secretary. The International Congress of Genealogical and Heraldic Sciences is a biennial convention for genealogists, heraldic scholars and others working in related fields. The Congress that year was under the leadership of the Swedish Baron Hamilton of Hageby. The reason for its foundation is explained in a report of the \\"Commission for State Heraldry\\" - composed of: Baron Alessandro Monti della Corte, President, who was also the Chancellor of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus; Hungarian author Noble Professor Gèza Grosschmid Zsögöd de Visegrad, Vice President; Roger Harmignies, Rapporteur; and by its Members: Portcullis Pursuivant John Brooke-Little; Lt. Col. Robert Gayre, a Scottish anthropologist and author who had an interest in heraldry; Robert Matagne; genealogist and officer of arms Sir Iain Moncreiffe of that Ilk, Bt., Baron of Easter Moncreiffe; Elisabeth Prins; Officer of Arms Conrad Swan and Paul Warming - concerning point 4, \\"the decisions of the III Congress at Madrid (1955)Madrid had recently seen the foundation of the Instituto Internacional de Genealogía y Heráldica and the journal Hidalguía, which, from 1953, have made great efforts against bogus Orders of Knighthood. were recalled relative to the juridical and historical conditions which had to apply to independent, both Dynastic and Family, Orders of Chivalry and it was recommended to prepare a list, albeit provisional, of the said Orders so that they might be studied and then approved at the following congress.\\".Rivista Araldica, V Congresso Internazionale di Scienze Araldiche e Genealogiche, Anno LVIII, 1960, p. 275. The purpose of the ICOC was originally to determine the legitimacy of orders of chivalry as, since the late 19th century, a number of purported orders had been operating, bestowing (and often selling) chivalric and noble titles. It was believed that an organisation like the ICOC, while not possessing any actual powers of enforcement, could research the relative legitimacy of claimed orders and provide the public with objective information about the orders to enable them to choose legitimate ones.  Initial controversy (1964–1999)  The first Register (1964) was published with the agreement of all the commissioners, but a second one was published without their authorization by Robert Gayre, who included the Order of Saint Lazarus (statuted 1910) in the list,p. 299, \\"The Sword and the Green Cross: The Saga of the Knights of Saint Lazarus from the Crusades to the 21st Century\\" by Max Ellull, AuthorHouse Publishers, 2011 and many of the other members of the board of directors resigned in protest. Gayre replaced them with members of the Order of Saint Lazarus, and those sympathetic to their goal to be recognized as a legitimate chivalric order. During the period 1964-98, there were meetings held in 1964 (The Hague), 1966 (Paris), 1967 (Brussels), 1970 (Vienna and Munich), 1984 (Washington); later and until 1996, there were only private meetings between commissioners in the house of Robert Gayre.2016 ICOC Register, p. 7. In 1970, the ICOC decided also to approve the \\"Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, Knights Hospitaller (or \\"Royal Yugoslavian Order of Saint John\\"),2007 ICOC Register a move that further alienated the ICOC from the company of respectable scholarship and increasingly cast suspicion on their own validity. By 1996, the last year of Robert Gayre's presidency, the Vice-President of the ICOC was Terence Francis MacCarthy. On 28 January 1992, the Irish Genealogical Office conferred courtesy Chief of the Name recognition to Terence MacCarthy as the MacCarthy Mór, the title of the chief of the MacCarthy sept or clan.The title literally means \\"the great MacCarthy.\\" The MacCarthys had been princes of Desmond, and earlier, through the Eoghanacht of Cashel, the kings of Munster. Terence MacCarthy claimed the title based on tanistry rather than primogeniture, and said that his father renounced the title in his favour in 1980. He led an affiliation of MacCarthy clan associations in Ireland, Canada, and the United States, which appealed to heritage tourism trends of the time. This recognition by the prestigious Irish Genealogical Office allowed him to gain credibility in nobiliary circles in the world, so it was easy for him to be the founder of the self-styled Irish chivalric Order the Niadh Nask, and to fraudulently claim to be \\"Prince of Desmond\\" the MacCarthy Mòr. Robert Gayre himself had assumed the fantasy title of \\"Baron of Lochoreshire\\",The Hospitaller Order Of Saint Lazarus by C. Savona-Ventura and claimed to be the chief of the Clan Gayre, which he had earlier invented.p. 1866, \\"World Orders of Knighthood and Merit\\" by Guy Stair Sainty, Burke's Peerage London 2006 () \\"...the late Robert Gayre (first Chief of the newly formed Clan Gayre)...\\" However, the Lord Lyon King of Arms recognized Robert Gayre as Gayre of Gayre and Nigg, Chief of the Name and Arms of Gayre, and Baron of Lochoreshire, as published in Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage.See: Burke's Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage, 107th Edition, by Charles Mosley (Editor), p. 1530. Gayre served as MacCarthy's \\"Constable\\" in the Niadh Nask. The other eight members of the board of the ICOC in 1996 included Patrick O'Kelly, who claimed to be \\"Baron O'Kelly de Conejera\\", and six other members of the Niadh Nask. Since the Niadh Nask was heretofore unknown within the world of chivalric orders, Robert Gayre and the ICOC expanded the original focus of the group to include a new category, called \\"Dynastic Nobiliary Fraternities\\". Hundreds of people, taken in by these claims, joined the Niadh Nask or donated to their \\"cause\\", totaling about $1 million. Among those convinced by the hoax were former Irish Prime Ministers Charles Haughey, Albert Reynolds, and John Brooke-Little. After Gayre's death in 1996, Terence Francis MacCarthy assumed the position of President and continued using the ICOC as a vehicle to advance his fraudulent nobiliary claims. In July 1999, the falsity of Terence Francis MacCarthy's claims was discovered and reported in the media, and he resigned from the ICOC.Sean J. Murphy, \\"Twilight of the Chiefs: The Mac Carthy Mór Hoax\\", 2004, Academica Press, Bethesda, Md., During this period, these Registers were published: 1964 (2nd edition), without the permission of the president Baron Alessandro Monti della Corte, the event that caused his resignation; 1970; 1978, issued under the presidency of H.S.H. Prince Ernst August of Lippe; 1996, issued under the presidency of Robert Gayre; and 1998, issued under the presidency of Terence Francis MacCarthy.See 2016 ICOC Register.  Consolidation since 1999  Since 1999, the President of the ICOC has been Dr. Pier Felice degli Uberti, who immediately decided to admit the errors of the past, although these happened without his own fault: In 1999, the ICOC also decided to remove the Order of Saint Lazarus (statuted 1910) from the Register's list of legitimate orders of chivalry. The purpose was to return to the initial mission of the ICOC commission born in the congresses and the only one which was authorized by Paul Adam, president of AIH, to continue its complex work also at the end of the Congress (1962) remaining as a Permanent Commission. Pier Felice degli Uberti's first act was to ask all the commissioners their curriculum vitae, removing those whose academic standing was not sufficient to the position of commissioner; abolished all the precedent Registers bringing into force the first edition of 1964 Register and deleting the questionable orders in time inserted. The previous board membership was replaced largely by individuals of greater credibility in the heraldry and chivalric orders community, such as author and nobiliary expert Guy Stair Sainty, genealogical and heraldic expert as Roger Harmignies, Cecil Humphery-Smith, Michel Popoff, Henrik Klackenberg, Elizabeth Roads, Hervé Pinoteau, Peter Kurrild-Klitgaard, Robert Watt, President of International Academy of Heraldry - AIH, Michel Teillard d'Eyry, President of International Academy of Genealogy - AIG as well as historian of the crusades Jonathan Riley-Smith. Starting from 2002, the ICOC began to hold its General Assemblies within the international colloquia of the International Academies of Heraldry - AIH and Genealogy - AIG and, from 2010, within the International Congresses of Heraldic and Genealogical Sciences (as was the case when the Commission was founded). As suggested by the Executive Committee, the International Commission for Orders of Chivalry Prize was founded within the Prizes and Awards Commission of the Confédération Internationale de Généalogie et d’Héraldique, to be conferred on a publication about chivalry and awards, starting from the XXVIII International Congress of Genealogical and Heraldic Sciences of Quebec City (2008). * The 1st 2008 edition was awarded to Guy Stair Sainty and Rafal (\\"Rafe\\") Heydel-Mankoo for their publication \\"World Orders of Knighthood and Merit\\" (2006). * The 2nd 2010 edition was granted to D’Arcy Jonathan Dacre Boulton, PhD, for his publication \\"The Knights of the Crown: The Monarchical Orders of Knighthood in Later Medieval Europe, 1325-1520\\" (1987). * The 3rd 2012 edition was awarded to Prof. Peter Kurrild Klitgaard, PhD, for his publication \\"Knights of Fantasy: Self-styled ‘Orders’ called ‘of Saint John’ or ‘of Malta’ in the Nordic countries.

Prof. P J Galloway, OBE, JP, FSA for his works: \\"The Order of the Thistle\\" (2009), \\"Order of St Patrick\\" (1983 and 1999), \\"Order of the Bath\\" (2006), \\"Order of St Michael and St George\\" (2000), \\"The Royal Victorian Order\\" (1996), \\"Order of the British Empire\\" (1996) and \\"The Companions of Honour\\" (2002). In 2015, the ICOC decided to consider as Knightly Orders to be included in the Register only those historical, while the other classifications should be deemed as appendices in order to inform of their existence, but without going about their evaluation. In addition all the new creations, currently being made by Heads of once ruling Houses, should be simply considered as awarding systems without chivalric content. Publications In 1964, the ICOC expanded their original focus by adding a new category which they called \\"Noble Corporations\\". They expanded further in 1984 with \\"Other Noble Corporations\\", in 1998 with \\"Ecclesiastical Decorations\\", in 2000 with \\"Bodies of a Chivalric Character\\" and \\"Bodies inspired by chivalry\\", in 2001 with \\"Bodies which referred to Orders or awards which had been awarded by state bodies in the past\\" and again in 2002 with \\"Revivals of ancient chivalric institutions founded as Orders by the dynastic successor of the founding authority; New chivalric institutions founded by the head of a former reigning dynasty; Successors of chivalric institutions founded under the authority of a state\\".

Rocket trajectory was intended to carry the rocket about high and horizontally from WSMR Launch Complex 33. Impact velocity of returning rockets was reduced by inducing structural failure of the rocket airframe upon atmospheric re-entry. More durable recordings and instruments might be recovered from the rockets after ground impact, but telemetry was developed to transmit and record instrument readings during flight. History The first of 300 railroad cars of V-2 rocket components began to arrive at Las Cruces, New Mexico in July 1945 for transfer to WSMR. (So much equipment was taken from Germany that the Deutsches Museum later had to obtain a V-2 for an exhibit from the US.) In November General Electric (GE) employees began to identify, sort, and reassemble V-2 rocket components in WSMR Building 1538, designated as WSMR Assembly Building 1. The Army completed a blockhouse in WSMR Launch Area 1 in September 1945. WSMR Launch Complex 33 for the captured V-2s was built around this blockhouse. Initial V-2 assembly efforts produced 25 rockets available for launch. The Army assembled an Upper Atmosphere Research Panel of representative from the Air Material Command, Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), Army Signal Corps, Ballistic Research Laboratory, Applied Physics Laboratory, University of Michigan, Harvard University, Princeton University, and General Electric Company. German rocket scientists of Operation Paperclip arrived at Fort Bliss in January 1946 to assist the V-2 rocket testing program. After a static test firing of a V-2 engine on 15 March 1946, the first V-2 rocket launch from Launch Complex 33 was on 16 April 1946. As the possibilities of the program were realized, GE personnel built new control components to replace deteriorated parts and used replacement parts with salvaged materials to make more than 75 V-2 sounding rockets available for atmospheric and solar investigation at WSMR. Approximately two V-2 launches per month were scheduled from Launch Complex 33 until the supply of V-2 sounding rockets was exhausted. A reduced frequency of V-2 sounding rocket investigations from Launch Complex 33 continued until 1952. See also: Launches of captured V-2 rockets in the United States after 1945 Modifications The explosive warhead in the nose cone was replaced by a package of instrumentation averaging . Instrumentation was sometimes added to the control compartment, in the rear motor section, between the fuel tanks, or on the fins or skin of the rocket. Nose cone instrumentation was typically assembled at participating laboratories and flown to WSMR to be joined to the rocket in Assembly Building 1. Rockets returning to earth intact created an impact crater about wide and of similar depth which filled with debris to a depth of about . In an effort to preserve instruments, dynamite was strategically placed within the airframe to be detonated at an elevation of during downward flight at end of the high- altitude scientific observation interval. These explosives weakened the rocket structure so it would be torn apart by aerodynamic forces as it re-entered the denser lower atmosphere. Terminal velocity of tumbling fragments was reduced by an order of magnitude. Performance V-2 sounding rockets were long and in diameter and weighed with a full load of liquid fuel contributing two- thirds of that weight. The fuel was consumed in the first minute of flight producing a thrust of . Maximum acceleration of 6 Gs was reached at minimum fuel weight just before burnout, and vibrational accelerations were of similar magnitude during powered flight. Velocity at burnout was approximately per second. The rocket would typically have a small, unpredictable angular momentum at burnout causing unpredictable roll with pitch or yaw as it coasted upward approximately . A typical flight provided an observation window of 5 minutes at altitudes above . Instrumentation Servomechanisms were devised to compensate for rocket aspect changes as it tumbled after burnout. These allowed sun-tracking devices to measure the solar electromagnetic spectrum. Limited success was achieved with parachute recovery of instrumentation, but some of the more durable instruments or recordings within the rocket airframe could withstand impact with the earth at subsonic velocities. NRL developed a telemetry system using a 23-channel pulse-time modulation. Voltage presented to the input terminals of a given channel determined spacing between two adjacent pulses, not entirely unlike the technique of pulse-position modulation. Space between first and second pulses was determined by channel 1, between second and third pulses by channel 2, and so forth. The system made 200 samplings per second of 24 pulses. Information was transmitted via high- power frequency modulation. Ground receiving stations translated pulse spacings back into voltages which were applied to a bank of string galvanometers to make an approximately continuous record of each channel on a moving roll of film. Accuracy was within approximately 5 percent. Animals tests The first animals sent into space were fruit flies aboard a U.S.-launched V-2 rocket on 20 February 1947 from White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.UPPER AIR ROCKET SUMMARY V-2 NO. 20. postwarv2.com The purpose of the experiment was to explore the effects of radiation exposure at high altitudes. The rocket reached 68 miles (109 km) in 3 minutes and 10 seconds, past both the U.S. Air Force 50-mile and the international 100 km definitions of the boundary of space. The Blossom capsule was ejected and successfully deployed its parachute. The fruit flies were recovered alive. Other V-2 missions carried biological samples, including moss. Albert II, a rhesus monkey, became the first monkey in space on 14 June 1949, in a U.S.-launched V-2, after the failure of the original Albert's mission on ascent. Albert I reached only 30–39 miles (48–63 km) altitude; Albert II reached about 83 miles (134 km). Albert II died on impact after a parachute failure. Numerous monkeys of several species were flown by the U.S. in the 1950s and 1960s. Monkeys were implanted with sensors to measure vital signs, and many were under anesthesia during launch. The death rate among monkeys at this stage was very high: about two-thirds of all monkeys launched in the 1940s and 1950s died on missions or soon after landing.

She was a member of one of four indigenous Klallam communities of the Pacific Northwest. Smith was one of the last two native speakers of the Klallam language who spoke it as her first language. Smith led efforts to revive the Klallam language. Adeline Smith created the first Klallam alphabet with Timothy Montler, a professor of linguistics at the University of North Texas. Smith and Montler also developed the first Klallam dictionary, which was published in December 2012. She was the largest contributor, offering 12,000 words and phrases to the dictionary. Her revitalization work has enabled the Klallam language to be taught to public and private students from preschool through high school. Smith also championed the preservation of Tse-whit-zen, a historic Lower Elwha village which is approximately 2,700 years old, rediscovered during a construction project on the waterfront in Port Angeles, and the restoration of the Elwha River. The removal of the Elwha dams, beginning in September 2011, drained Lake Aldwell reservoir, which had been created before she was born. The destruction of the dams and drainage of the lake uncovered the Klallam ceremonial creation site. Biography Early life Smith was born on March 15, 1918. She was raised on a family homestead on the Elwha River, just outside Port Angeles, Washington. Her family spoke only Klallam at home and Smith did not have an English language name until she first enrolled in public school when she was seven years old. Her great- grandparents passed down the family's unwritten, oral history with events from the late 18th century. Smith was forced to leave Chemawa Indian School, a boarding school in Salem, Oregon, shortly before her graduation due to the death of her mother and needs of her family. At age 18 she moved to Seattle with her niece, Bea Charles, to find work, despite the widespread discrimination against Native Americans at the time. (Bea Charles, who died in 2009, later became a noted Klallam linguist). Smith worked a series of jobs, finding employment as a waitress and an employee of Goodwill Industries. During World War II, Smith worked as a welder at a submarine factory in San Francisco and at a Boeing plant in Seattle. Klallam linguistic preservation Smith was working a job in Neah Bay, Washington, as a salal picker when she decided to move back permanently to the Lower Elwha Klallam reservation outside Port Angeles. She had worked outside the reservation for more than forty years by that time. Once she was back with the Lower Elwha, she began teaching Klallam history and culture. In the 1990s, Smith began trying to revive the Klallam language, which had fallen into disuse. She co- created the first Klallam alphabet with Timothy Montler, a professor of linguistics at the University of North Texas. She worked with Montler throughout the 1990s, 2000s, and early 2010s to create the first Klallam- language dictionary. Smith contributed 12,000 words to the dictionary, making her the largest single contributor to the new lexicon. To research entries for the dictionary, Smith transcribed Khallam language recordings, which were made by the late ethnologist John Peabody Harrington in Khallam communities in 1942. The transcriptions took her months to complete. The Klallam Dictionary, a 983-page book, was published by the University of Washington Press in December 2012. It is one of the largest books ever published by the UW Press. The dictionary was unveiled at a celebration ceremony held at the Port Gamble S'Klallam longhouse on November 28, 2012. The ceremony was attended by members of the Lower Elwha, Jamestown S'Klallam, and Port Gamble Klallam communities. Members of the three tribal governments held up portraits of Smith, who could not attend, to honor her contributions to the dictionary. Smith held her first copy of the dictionary in January 2013. Copies of the dictionary were distributed to all Klallam tribal government offices and schools. Smith trained new teachers in the Klallam language and culture. Since 2013, the Klallam language is taught in both private Klallam tribal and public schools in the Port Angeles area due to her efforts. Classes are taught from the elementary to high school levels. Smith was the subject of a documentary, The Life of a Klallam Girl Growing up on the Elwha River. Smith continued to create written accounts of the Klallam's oral history and stories until shortly before her death in 2013. Elwha River restoration Adeline Smith appeared in U.S. federal court in cases on behalf of her Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe. Her efforts are credited with helping to win the 1974 Boldt court decision, which upheld the rights of the Lower Elwha and other tribes under past treaties to half the catch of a salmon run. In 1992, Smith lobbied the United States Congress in the run-up to a vote to tear down dams along the Elwha River. She lived to see the removal of the dams, including the Elwha Dam, from the river beginning in September 2011, and the return of the first salmon to the river. The removal of one of the dams in 2012 drained Lake Aldwell, a man-made reservoir created in 1913, revealing the Klallam ceremonial creation site in July 2012. It had been submerged since the reservoir was filled. She is featured in the film \\"Unconquering th Last Frontier\\" by Robert Lundahl, narrated by actor, Gary Farmer, and seen on Public Television. In the film, Adeline recalls her early years growing up along the Elwha River, and relates stories about the devastation of the fisheries there, and the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe's efforts to remove two industrial power dams and restore the river ecosystem. Preservation of Tse- whit-zen Smith championed the preservation of Tse-whit-zen, a historic Lower Elwha village located at the base of Ediz Hook, which dates back to approximately 2,700 years. The site is the largest ancient Native American village discovered in Washington state to date. As a child, Smith had been warned by adults never to walk on or play on the site of Tse-whit-zen, which is considered sacred by the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe. Smith campaigned against the construction of a drydock on the Port Angeles waterfront. It was intended to be used to build floating bridge pontoons for the Hood Canal Bridge replacement. The graving yard project, which was being constructed by the Washington state government, encountered the large village site of Tse- whit-zen, including its cemetery. More than three hundred bodies were exhumed and removed from the site before Washington Governor Gary Locke intervened and permanently halted the construction in December 2004. The three hundred remains were reburied by the Lower Elwha. The state government turned over ownership of the area of Tse-whit-zen to the Lower Elwha Klallam. Legacy Adeline Smith died from heart failure in Puyallup, Washington, on March 19, 2013, just four days after her 95th birthday. She was buried in Neah Bay Cemetery. She was predeceased by her first husband Roosevelt Suppah, their son Mark Suppah; and by her second husband Roy Smith, and their children Roy Smith Jr., and Patricia Smith Forbe. With Smith's death, Hazel Sampson, 103 years old in March 2013, was left as the last living native speaker of the Klallam language. Smith was the last Klallam native speaker to teach her language on Washington's Olympic Peninsula. Smith had planned to make audio recordings of additional Klallam stories in the Spring of 2013.

He was President of the Australian Paralympic Federation and the International Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Sports Federation. Personal McCullough was born on 12 October 1931. He was an aircraft engineer and worked for the Australian Public Service. He died on 9 January 2017, aged 75. Sport administration career In 1983, McCullough was the inaugural Chairperson of the North Queensland Sports Foundation. He held this position until 1986. From 1989 to 1999, he was President of Wheelchair Sports Australia (now Australian Athletes with a Disability). In 1994, he was appointed President of the Australian Paralympic Federation. He took over the Federation at a time when it had limited funds and near bankruptcy. McCullough put in place a marketing and fundraising strategy that aimed to raise $1.5 million for the team to compete at the 1996 Atlanta Paralympic Games. An outcome of this approach was the Motor Accident Authority of New South Wales providing $100,000 and employment for 10 athletes in the promotion of disabilities through motor vehicle accidents. Whilst President, he negotiated an agreement with the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee so that the Federation received $5.5 million for marketing rights over the four years leading to the 2000 Sydney Paralympics. These financial arrangements coupled with the Australian Governments Paralympic Preparation Program led to the Australian team finishing 2nd on the medal tally at the 1996 Atlanta Games. McCullogh was replaced as President in 1997 by Marie Little. He was a Director of the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee (1997–2000). McCullough’s contribution to international sport included his roles as President of the International Stoke Mandeville Wheelchair Sports Federation (1996–2001), International Paralympic Committee Executive (1996–2002), and representative of the Paralympics in the IOC Evaluation Commission for the 2008 Bidding Cities (2001).

In the general election, she defeated Democratic nominee Henry Sanchez, taking nearly 66 percent of more than 22,000 votes. She would not face any Republican opposition for the GOP nomination in the 70th District in her two re-election campaigns, running unopposed in 2004 and 2006. In the 2004 general election she faced a re-match with Sanchez, winning re-election by again taking nearly 66 percent of more than 34,000 votes. She defeated 21-year-old Christopher Mahar by taking nearly 64 percent of almost 30,000 votes. She was not eligible to run for a fourth term as the Michigan Constitution limits state Representatives to three terms. Michigan Senate After Rick Snyder won the GOP nomination for governor in August 2010, he stunned political observes by picking then-state Rep. Brian Calley as his choice to be the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor on August 25, 2010. Just weeks earlier, Calley had won the GOP nomination for the 33rd state Senate district. On September 3, 2010, Emmons was chosen as Calley's replacement by the 33rd District Republican Party Executive Committee, covering Clinton, Ionia, Isabella and Montcalm counties. The committee selected Emmons over Scott Hummel in an 82-37 vote. In the November general election, Emmons defeated Democratic nominee James Hoisington, capturing almost 65 percent of almost 78,000 votes. Emmons officially filed for a second term on April 17, 2014. She won re-nomination uncontested in August 2014. On November 4, 2014, Emmons won re-election to the state Senate defeating former educator and counselor Fred Sprague, taking 57 percent of the vote. Emmons is prohibited from seeking re-election to the state Senate, as the state Constitution limits Senators to be elected to a maximum of two, four-year terms.

Col Montagu William Douglas CSI, CIE. (1863 – February 1957) was a British soldier and colonial administrator in India. As the Assistant District Commissioner in the Punjab, he investigated the attempted murder allegation made by Henry Martyn Clark against Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the founder of the Ahmadiyya movement. Ahmad later declared him to be the \\"Pilate of our time\\", superior to the original. In his later life he was a noted advocate of the Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship and was president of the Shakespeare Fellowship for many years. Early life and career He was born to Edward Douglas, (1831–1867) and Annie Arbuthnot, (b. 1831). In February 1884 he joined the 1st Battalion, North Staffordshire Regiment, switching to the Indian army in 1887. He was promoted to captain in 1895. In 1891, Douglas married Helen Mary Isabelle Downer (b. 1863). They had three children, Edward Montagu Douglas (b. 1891), Major Archibald Stair Montagu Douglas, MM, (1897–1974),Biographical history of Gonville and Caius College Ernest Stewart Roberts, Edward John Gross - 1948 p169 \\"Douglas, Archibald Stair Montagu: son of Lieut. -Colonel Montagu William Douglas, CI.E., of Port Blair, Andaman Islands; and Helen Mary ..\\" and Helen Elizabeth Douglas (b. 1893).The Douglas ArchivesPortraits in the India Office Library and Records p63 India Office Library and Records, Pauline Rohatgi - 1983 \\"Douglas, Montagu William (1863–1957) Lieut -Colonel.

Photo 206 x 271mm \\" Investigation of attempted murder claims In 1897, having been appointed assistant district commissioner in the Punjab, Douglas was required to investigate the allegations of Henry Martyn Clark against Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. Clark, a Christian missionary, had been approached by a youth named Abdul Hamid, who claimed that Ahmad had sent him to kill Clark. Douglas found Hamid's claims to be implausible, and that there was evidence that Hamid had been coached. He had also repeatedly changed and even retracted his story. Douglas dismissed the charges. Even after more than forty years he vividly remembered the case and its details. He wrote to J. D. Shams, an Ahmadiyya missionary in London on 29 July 1939, \\"... the evidence was false and thus I acquitted Mirza Ghulam Ahmad\\".Letter dated 29 July 1939 to J D Shams The aftermath was presented by Ahmad's supporters as a triumph, and as evidence of Ahmad's divine mission.Muhammad Zafrulla Khan, Ahmadiyyat: the renaissance of Islam, Tabshir Publications, 1978, p.189. Subsequently, Ahmad compared Douglas favourably with Pontius Pilate, declaring him to be a man of much superior character, stating, > In my opinion, Captain Douglas outshines Pilate in imparting judgment > fearlessly and in showing determination and steadfastness ... Pilate showed > cowardice due to fear of the High Priest and the Elders, and acted in a > cowardly manner. But Captain Douglas showed no sign of weakness ... Those > who are blessed with honour from above do not hanker after worldly honours. > This commendable courtesy by the 'Pilate' of our time shall be remembered by > all my followers when I am gone. He shall be remembered till the end of the > world with love and respect.\\"Tadhkirat-ush-Shahadatain, Ruhani Khaza’in, > vol. 20, pp. 30-41.Tadh-Kiratushaha-Datain online In his book Kitab ul Baryyah (An Account of Exoneration) Mirza Ghulam Ahmad has narrated the details of the case.Kitab ul Baryyah Later career and retirement Douglas was appointed Deputy Commissioner in 1899, and was promoted to Major on 6 February 1902. He was on the executive committee for the Coronation Durbar at Delhi in 1903. From 1910-1913 he was Deputy Commissioner of the Lylpur District. He then served as Chief Commissioner of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands from 1913–1920.List of Rulers Provinces British IndiaDavid P. Henige, Colonial governors from the fifteenth century to the present, 1970, p.84 Douglas was honoured as Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in 1903 and as Companion of the Order of the Star of India (CSI) in 1919. In his retirement he was an advocate of Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship and wrote The Earl of Oxford as “Shakespeare”; an outline of the case (1931).H. N. Gibson, The Shakespeare Claimants: A Critical Survey of the Four Principal Theories Concerning the Authorship of the Shakespearean Plays, Taylor & Francis, 1962, p.73. In 1928 he became president of The Shakespeare Fellowship, after the death of its founder George Greenwood. He held the post until 1945. Douglas advocated a \\"group theory\\" of Shakespeare authorship with Oxford as the \\"master mind\\".R. C. Churchill, Shakespeare and His Betters: A History and a Criticism of the Attempts Which Have Been Made to Prove That Shakespeare's Works Were Written by Others, Max Reinhardt, London, 1938, p. 51 In Lord Oxford and the Shakespeare Group (1952) he expanded his theory, asserting that Oxford's fellow-contributors were Francis Bacon, Christopher Marlowe, the Earl of Derby, John Lyly and Robert Greene.Schoenbaum, Sam, Shakespeare's Lives, Oxford University Press, 1991, p.435. According to James S. Shapiro Douglas also believed that \\"Queen Elizabeth had entrusted Oxford to oversee a propaganda department that would produce patriotic plays and pamphlets\\".James Shapiro, Contested Will: Who Wrote Shakespeare?, Faber & Faber, 2011, p.216. In his later life he also painted and was among amateurs exhibited at the Royal Academy.

Millions of people in the U.S. suffer from stroke, multiple sclerosis, postpolio, spinal cord injuries, or various other ailments that benefit from the use of orthoses.Dollar, Aaron M., and Hugh Herr. \\"Lower extremity exoskeletons and active orthoses: challenges and state-of-the-art.\\" Robotics, IEEE Transactions on 24.1 (2008): 144-158. Insofar as active orthoses and powered exoskeletons are concerned, the technology to build these devices is improving rapidly, but little research has been done on the human side of these human-machine interfaces.  Active orthoses  Active, or powered, orthoses differ from exoskeletons in that orthoses generally refer to assistive devices to help people with disabilities walk. Exoskeletons typically refer to devices intended to augment an otherwise healthy individual's movements. However, the terms \\"active orthosis\\" and \\"exoskeleton\\" are often used interchangeably. They can be made to either assist or resist the wearer's movement. Assisting movement is beneficial for rehabilitation,Sawicki, Gregory S., Keith E. Gordon, and Daniel P. Ferris. \\"Powered lower limb orthoses: applications in motor adaptation and rehabilitation.\\"Rehabilitation Robotics, 2005. ICORR 2005. 9th International Conference on. IEEE, 2005. http://www.kines.umich.edu/sites/webservices.itcs.umich.edu.drupal.kinesprod/files/resource_files/Sawicki2005.pdf for providing soldiers and nurses with increased strength to improve job performance, and for aiding people who have repetitive jobs, such as factory workers, to prevent injury. Lastly, this technology is also used to enable people who ordinarily cannot walk by their own means to walk (eLEGS demonstration) Powered orthoses have also been made to resist or alter movement. The purpose of such orthoses is to study how the human body adapts to various difficulties. For example, if one muscle is restricted from movement, can our bodies figure out what other muscles to use instead?  Powering the human  While most articles on exoskeletons focus on how to power the device, it is also important to know how to power the human who is using it. When designing an exoskeleton, the power requirements of each joint must be understood. Through gait analysis, we know that power varies across the hip, knee, and ankle joints. How the power is dispersed across these joints changes greatly depending on how fast the person is walking, if they are walking on a hill or if they are climbing stairs A challenge with powering the user is knowing how much power that particular person requires, and at what precise moment does he/she need that power activated. Too much or too little power will make the technology useless, but making it just right for the wearer means customizing each device.  Metabolic cost  The primary method in determining whether a device is assisting the person's task or hindering it is to measure the metabolic cost required to do the task. The metabolic cost is how much a person consumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide while performing a task.Brockway, J. M. \\"Derivation of formulae used to calculate energy expenditure in man.\\" Hum Nutr Clin Nutr 41.6 (1987): 463-71.Donelan, J. Maxwell, Rodger Kram, and Arthur D. Kuo. \\"Mechanical work for step-to-step transitions is a major determinant of the metabolic cost of human walking.\\" Journal of Experimental Biology 205.23 (2002): 3717-3727. To test whether the exoskeleton or active orthosis actually benefits the wearer, studies are done in which subjects first do the task without the device, then they do the same task while wearing the device, and the metabolic costs from the two tasks are compared. As of 2008, only one exoskeleton (as opposed to active orthosis) had been found to actually reduce the metabolic cost of walking while carrying a load. Very little research on exoskeleton metabolic cost is done, but one study done by the U.S. Army Natick Soldier Center found that the exoskeleton they used actually increased the metabolic cost by 40%.Gregorczyk, Karen N., et al. The effects of a lower body exoskeleton load carriage assistive device on oxygen consumption and kinematics during walking with loads. ARMY NATICK SOLDIER CENTER MA, 2006. In 2012, S. Galle et al. studied the metabolic cost of a powered ankle-foot extensor that assisted users with push-off while walking. After about 20 minutes to adapt to the device, the users metabolic cost of walking was reduced by 9%.  Control  Ferris discusses the influence of controller types in his paper, A Physiologist's Perspective on Robotic Exoskeletons for Human Locomotion.

Use in research  Some active orthoses have been created for the sole purpose of research. According to neurophysiologist Dr. Keith Gordon, \\"locomotor adaptation in humans is not well understood. To provide insight into the neural reorganization that occurs following a significant disruption to one's learned neuromuscular map relating a given motor command to its resulting muscular action, we tied the mechanical action of a robotic exoskeleton to the EMG profile of the soleus muscle during walking\\". Daniel Ferris concurs in another paper, saying, \\"many key issues in locomotor physiology are either not well understood or under heated debate\\" His research team custom-made active orthoses for his research subjects to wear while walking on a treadmill. When the subject flexed his/her soleus muscle in order to plantar flex (which allows a person to push off the ground while walking), the device would restrict the subject's movement, forcing his/her foot towards dorsiflexion. After an hour of walking with the device (a break was included), the subjects used their soleus and gastrocnemius muscles less, so they wouldn't be forced to dorsiflex as much, but they were not able to fully adapt to the requirements of the device. Another study by Gordon's team showed that when the device works with our muscles, we adapt more easily. For example, he had subjects wear an active orthosis on one leg which performed a very strong plantar flexion every time they flexed the soleus, which is expected to plantar flex. However, the plantar flexion performed by the device was too strong and the subjects had to only use a minimal amount of muscle strength on that one leg in order to walk normally. People were able to adapt to this difficulty in under 30 minutes. Another study by S. Galle, et al., found similar results in the paper, \\"Adaptation to walking with an exoskeleton that assists ankle extension\\"Galle, S., et al. \\"Adaptation to walking with an exoskeleton that assists ankle extension.\\" Gait & Posture (2013). Gregory Sawiki, Keith Gordon, and Daniel Ferris together did a study on an active lower limb orthosis to understand how the device can be used to improve motor rehabilitation. After experimenting with different types of control (finding that some subjects thought that having a push button to activate the device required too much concentration, while others liked having the control over activation of the device), the team concluded that the ankle- foot orthosis they used needs a lot of improvements for rehabilitation, but could be \\"valuable in probing the relationship between gait mechanics and metabolic cost.\\"  Considerations  According to Hugh Herr, the performance of an orthosis should be based upon measurements of \\"metabolic cost of transport, walking speed, smoothness and repeatability of motions, muscle fatigue, and stability\\" as well as \\"the reduction of forces borne by the musculoskeletal system\\". Power source, portability and weight are the biggest challenges facing active orthoses. A sufficient power source with today's technology adds too much weight to the device, making it difficult to do much more than lift itself. For that reason, most active orthoses are tethered to a power source - which works well enough for research and patient rehabilitation, since that also means a computer is always nearby Other challenges when making an active orthosis is the close interface with the human. This presents difficulties with aligning the joints of the operator with the joints of the device, constraining the human's movements by attaching the device to his/her body, other forces from the device that resist movement, controlling the machine while wearing it, determining how the device is changing the human's biomechanics, and ensuring the safety of the wearer.Crowell III, Harrison P., Angela C.

Each patient requires a specific alteration to his or her gait. The orthosis must be able to generate power at the precise moment the patient is having trouble with his or her strideShamaei, Kamran, and Aaron M.

S-71-1056 (1971). * Berkeley Lower Extremity Exoskeleton * Ekso bionics = Knee = Thousands of people suffer from knee injuries, and because the knee supports the body weight during the stance phase while walking, more active orthoses are being made to relieve weight off the knee while in the stance phase. After suffering a neurological injury, patients typically must go through locomotor training that can involve several therapists. The task is quite hard on the therapist(s), so several devices have been made to assist with this problem. The Lokomat, AutoAmbulator, and the Mechanized Gait Trainer were all made to function with a treadmill. Wearable gait trainers would be useful to travel over ground. This adds the complications involved with starting and stopping a stride, changing direction, going up and down hills, and creating more challenging balancing exercises. = Foot = An extensive study was done to determine how thick the sole of a soldier's boot could be before it interfered with his/her actions. It was found that a 2-inch thick sole affected certain squatting positions and was less comfortable than a thinner sole, but can ultimately be implemented in exoskeleton designs. The purpose of the study was to determine how much space could be made available for sensors in a soldier's exoskeleton boot.Boynton, Angela C., and Harrison P. Crowell III.

Various marine animals are capable of aerial locomotion, i.e., jumping out of the water and moving through air. The possible reasons of this behavior are hunting, escaping from predator and saving energy for swimming or breathing. Some of the jumping behaviors initiate gliding and taxiing in air, while some of them end up falling back to water. Penetrating water surface The speed of motion in air is faster than in water because of drag force. The drag force is proportional to density of the fluid. The animal jumping out of water will feel almost no drag, since the air density is 1,000 times less than water density. Usually animals gain thrust for the jumping as how they lift themselves underwater. Some of them are group behavior. Mechanism Jet propulsion Jet propulsion generates thrust and momentum by shooting out water jets. Flying squid is known for their behavior of leaping out of the water. Ommastrephinae and Todarodinae are two subfamilies of squids under the family of Ommastrephidae. They utilize jet propulsion to jump out of water as they do underwater, including Japanese flying squid..,Muramatsu, K., J. Yamamoto, T. Abe, K. Sekiguchi, N. Hoshi, and Y.

They are commemorated on Nov. 18. Background There are two extant versions of Eusebius' Martyrs of Palestine and in both the shorter and the longer versions the stories of Alphaeus and Zaccheus are recounted, though with variations. Eusebius was present in Caesarea during the persecutions, part of the empire-wide campaign to suppress Christianity. Persecution of Christians in Caesarea The Emperor Diocletian had ordered that all in the Empire should perform worship and sacrifices to the Roman gods. The authorities in Caesarea were so keen that all should obey this order that, according to the shorter recension of Eusebius' Martyrs of Palestine, they seized one Christian leader by the hands, led him to the altar and thrust the offering into his right hand. He was then dismissed as if he had performed the sacrifice. It was agreed by those in charge that they would attest that two others had made the offerings, even though they had not. Another Christian opened his mouth to say that he refused to worship the Roman gods when the guards struck him across the face, prevented him from speaking, and dismissed him, so that, says Eusebius, of the many brought in from the area to perform acts of worship to the Roman gods or die, only two, Alphaeus and Zaccheus, \\"were honored with the crown of the holy martyrs.\\" Zaccheus The authorities in Caesarea had brought in Christians from the surrounding area to apostasize or face death. Among them was a deacon from Gadara, Zaccheus, so- called after the person in the New Testament, according to Eusebius in the long recension of Martyrs of Palestine, owing to his short stature and sweet nature. He spoke boldly of his faith before the judges, was tortured and put into a prison cell. Alphaeus Cousin of Zaccheus, Alphaeus was the lector of the church in Caesarea. Many Christians in the city and its surroundings, faced with the choice of their religious principles or death, were crowding into the city to perform sacrifices to the gods, when Alphaeus loudly and publicly denounced their apostasy. Whereupon he was brought before the judges, ordered to sacrifice, but refused, making defiant statements of his faith. Martyrdoms Alphaeus and Zaccheus were tortured together over a period of days, and repeatedly offered the opportunity to sacrifice to the gods and be freed, but they refused despite their sufferings. They were finally both decapitated on the same day. Martyr's crowns A certain eagerness to achieve martyrdom may be observed in these accounts, notably when Eusebius says that the Romans pretended that a number of Christians had performed the sacrifices to the gods and dismissed them, even though they had not and so only Alphaeus and Zaccheus \\"were honored with the crown of the holy martyrs.\\" Martyrs were thought to be welcomed straight into heaven, unlike others who would have to wait for the Day of Judgement, and be rewarded there with a martyr's crown.

Designed and built by Irving Gill with assistance from his nephew Louis John Gill in 1914-1915, it is an important example of Gill's modern architectural style, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The La Jolla Woman's Club was founded in 1894 as the Current Events Club, taking its present name in 1900. The social club was without a permanent home for the first twenty years of its existence.Who's Who Among the Women of California. 1922. p.86. The cornerstone of the building was laid in December 1913, with the inaugural meeting held in 1914. The site, design, and construction of the clubhouse were all donated to the La Jolla Woman's Club by philanthropist and club member Ellen Browning Scripps. The project cost a total of $40,000.LeBlanc, Sydney. The Architecture Traveler: A Guide to 250 Key Twentieth-Century American Buildings. 2000. p. 24. The building is a prime example of Irving Gill's modern style, exemplified by simple geometrical shapes, and generous use of arches and columns, with a minimum of ornamentation. This style has been described as \\"shaved Spanish,\\" as it owes much to the colonial Spanish architecture of southern California - and in particular the California missions - with an emphasis on flat rooflines, and lack of frills.Kidder Smith, G.E. Source Book of American Architecture. 1996. p. 337. The building also was a product of Gill's experimentation with the concrete \\"tilt-wall\\" construction method, in which concrete slabs were poured in place onto a large table positioned at a fifteen-degree angle. After it was set, the wall was lifted into place, and windows fitted into it. The interior of the building also showcases Gill's interest in sanitation: there are no baseboards, mouldings, or other design details, as Gill believed that these features trapped dust and dirt. The La Jolla Woman's Club has been called one of Gill's most successful works.Kaplan, Wendy. \\"Building Utopia,\\", from Modernism in Design, Paul Greenhalgh, ed. 1990. p.106. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974, and is one of several notable Gill-designed buildings in La Jolla, along with The Bishop's School and the La Jolla Recreation Center. The clubhouse is open to visitors on Saturdays from 9:00 am to noon.

She was President of the Australian Paralympic Federation and AUSRAPID. Personal Little (née Mogford) was born on 1 January 1933. Little grew up in Hamilton, Victoria and attended Mount St Michael's College and Hamilton High School, Victoria. Between 1968 and 1971, she undertook a social work degree at Adelaide University. She has four children and separated from her husband after 15 years. After a short illness, Little died peacefully after a short battle with cancer on 17 August 2014 at Mary Potter Hospice in Adelaide, South Australia. Sport administration career In the 1960s, Little presented a women’s sport radion program for 3HA Hamilton. She was President of the Hamilton Amateur Basketball Association. In 1982, she was elected the inaugural President of SASRAPID (South Australian Sport and Recreation Association for People with Integration Difficulties Incorporated). In 1986, she founded AUSRAPID and started argue the case with state and national sports organisations to include people with an intellectual disability in mainstream sport. She was President of AUSRAPID from 1986 to 2011. In 1992, she was Chef de Mission of the Australian Team at the Madrid Games for intellectual disability athletes which was held immediately after the Barcelona Paralympics. On her retirement from AUSRAPID in 2011, Little noted that her involvement can be traced back to innocent question from a young lady with a disability - Why can’t I play Netball? Incoming AUSRAPID President Wayne Bird stated the passion and energy she has had for the organisation, and more so for the athletes who benefit has been unbelievable. Marie can be very proud of her achievements and assured that her legacy will benefit many people for years to come. Little was one of the founding directors of the Australian Paralympic Federation (APF) in 1990. She was President from 1996 to 1997. During her term as President, the APF professionalised its administration with the goal of having a successful 2000 Sydney Paralympics. Little was a member of the bid committee for the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games from 1991 to 1993. After Sydney won the right to host the 2000 Summer Paralympics, Little was a member of the Sydney Paralympic Organising Committee (1993-1998), including a period as Vice-President from 1994 until 1998. Little was the first female Member of the International Paralympic Committee's Executive Board, from 1993 to 1997. Little was for many years on the executive board of INAS-FID, the international organisation for athletes with an intellectual impairment. After the 2000 Sydney Paralympic Games, athletes with an intellectual disability were suspended from the Paralympic Games following the cheating by the Spanish Paralympic Basketball Team at the Games. Little has led the fight for the re-inclusion of athletes with an intellectual disability into the Paralympic Games. After her death, there were several tributes to her contribution to athletes with a disability. Glenn Tasker, Australian Paralympic President, stated After first advocating for inclusion of people with an intellectual impairment into community sport in the 1970s, Marie became a shining example of how an individual with passion, humility, drive and commitment can make a difference. Greg Hartung, Australian Paralympic President from 1997 to 2013, stated High on the list of Marie’s personal traits were integrity and courage. She may not have been text book in her approach, but she knew instinctively what leadership demanded. This was evident in the way she championed the interests of athletes with an intellectual disability, in Australia and internationally. It was about serving, not ruling!

Scuba divers generally carry self-contained lights, but surface supplied divers may carry lights powered by cable supply . A dive light is routinely used during night dives and cave dives, when there is little or no natural light, but also has a useful function during the day, as water absorbs the longer (red) wavelengths first then the yellow and green with increasing depth. By using artificial light, it is possible to view an object in full color at greater depths. Need Water attenuates light by absorption, so use of a dive light will improve a diver's underwater vision at depth. As the depth increases, more light is absorbed by the water. Color absorption depends on the purity of the water - pure water is most transparent to blue frequencies, but impurities may reduce this significantly. Color vision is also affected by turbidity and larger particulate matter. History thumb 300px  Early underwater lights were fixed electric flood lamps or portable lamps with dry batteries for use by divers in standard diving dress. Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd developed a model of portable lamp with a parabolic lens and attached to the divers corselet via a ball and socket joint allowing the diver to use both hands while working. In 1906, the tungsten filament was introduced and used to produce 200 to 3,000 candlepower incandescent dive lights. The Siebe Gorman & Company introduced a 250-watt mercury vapor hand lamp in 1919 that could produce as much as 18,000 candles. For diving in turbid water, 45-watt Sodium hand lamps became the preferred choice. These early lights had to be turned on underwater to avoid cracking the heated glass as it entered cold water. The first lantern available to the US Navy had 150 candlepower. The early testing showed a need to increase the length of cable on the US Navy Standard Lantern from 125 feet to 250 feet in 1915 to allow for greater operational range. The United States Navy Experimental Diving Unit continues to evaluate dive lights for wet and dry illumination output, battery duration, watertight integrity, as well as maximum operating depth. Halogen bulbs came into use in the latter decades of the 20th century as they produced more light for the power used. They were followed by high intensity discharge lamps and later, light emitting diodes, both singly and in arrays. Surface supplied divers could use power from a cable in the umbilical, but scuba divers need lights that are independent of a connection to the surface to make best use of their mobility advantage. The portable power sources progressed from lead–acid batteries for rechargeable lights and zinc–carbon batteries for disposable power supplies, to alkaline batteries, Nickel–cadmium (NiCad), Nickel-metal hydride (NiMH), and most recently, rechargeable lithium–ion batteries Waterproof miners lights were found to be suitable for moderate depths and were popular for cave diving. For greater depths, home made, and later professionally manufactured canister lights continued the tradition of a powerful but heavy and bulky power supply, connected to a lightweight, easily carried light-head, which could be carried in the hand or suspended from a clip or round the neck when both hands were needed for a task. The Goodman handle was developed to allow the light head to be carried on the back of the hand, which freed up the fingers for other tasks. This was later developed into the Goodman glove, a soft partial glove which supports the light in the same way as a Goodman handle. As of 2000, canister lights with sealed lead-acid batteries(12V 7AH) were standard for primary cave lights, with HID also popular for caving as they were more efficient, using lower wattage for equivalent lumens – an 18W HID would be brighter and burn longer than 50W halogen. The disadvantage of HID was that it could not be turned off then immediately on again and was much more expensive. There has been a continuous increase in lumen output for lower power of light sources, and increased power density of batteries. By the second decade of the 21st century compact hand held lights with several thousand lumens output were available in wide and narrow beam configurations, sometimes combined and sometimes combined with red LEDs and flashing sequences similar to strobes. These lights are often also suitable for use as video lights and can substitute for strobes for still photography, at a price. Some LED lights are also available with ultraviolet output for viewing and photography of fluorescent organisms. Both narrow beam spotlights and wide beam flood lights and combinations have been available since the early years. Some of the light heads had reflectors which could be slid along the axis to focus the beam, but more recent lights simply provide a separate set of LEDs for narrow and wide beam, and switch from one to the other as needed. Variable power output is also common on these lights and the power selected allows low brightness for a long burn time or higher brightness and shorted burn. An early canister light attributed to Frank Martz around 1965 used sealed beam automotive lights. Later cave lights used test tube light heads. These were made commercially in the early 1970s by Lamar English (English Engineering), and later Mark Leonard produced a range of canister lights with both circular and rectangular section canisters in acrylic and aluminium. Mark Leonard co-founded Dive-Rite, and American Underwater Lighting took over from English Engineering, Bill Gavin modified the English light with quick disconnect cables, which AUL produced as the Spectrum 1000 Extreme Exposure. NiCad batteries were in use in a few canister lights by 2000. Modern sources There are several options when it comes to light head/bulb types: Xenon (incandescent) - emit a warm natural light, and tend to be the less expensive, however, offer less brightness and have a shorter battery life than LED or HID lights. LED (light emitting diode) - are very durable, efficient and powerful. HID (high intensity discharge) - are extremely powerful and have a nearly white beam. On the downside, HIDs are very delicate and quite expensive. A modern dive light usually has an output of at least about 100 lumens. Bright dive lights have values from about 2500 lumens. Halogen lamps provide this light at over 50W power consumption. High- intensity discharge lamps (HID) and Light-emitting diodes (LED) can provide similar output for less power. Configuration handheld 1000-lumen LED dive light 50W halogen canister light Surface supplied light head and closed circuit video camera mounted on Kirby-Morgan 17 helmet. Hand held (Integral) The light source and the power supply are housed in the same water and pressure resistant housing. The light is switched on and off by a mechanism built into the housing Canister light Canister lights originated when the battery size required for sufficient burn time of a high output light was too large to be conveniently carried in the diver's hand. The work-around was to use a light-head with the light source, which is small and light enough to easily carry in the hand or on a head mount, and provide power through a cable from a waterproof battery canister, which is carried on the diver's harness. Head mount Head mount lights are used by divers who need to use both hands for other purposes. This can be underwater work by a commercial diver, or getting through tight restrictions for a cave or wreck diver. With a head mount there is a greater risk of dazzling other divers in the vicinity, as the lights move with the diver's head, and this arrangement is more appropriate for divers who work or explore alone. Helmet mounts are common for commercial work which is often monitored by a helmet mount closed circuit video camera. Both one piece lights intended to be hand held, and light heads powered from canisters or surface supplied cables are used for head mount lights. There are also a few one piece lights specifically made for head mounting, and a full face mask made by Ocean Reef which has integrated lighting. Caving head lights are sometimes usable as head mount lights for shallow cave dives, as they are waterproof, but they are generally not designed to be used under much pressure. Surface supplied If the diver is supplied with breathing gas from the surface, it is convenient to supply power for lights from the surface through the same umbilical. An extra cable is generally used for this purpose. The light head is functionally the same as for a canister light, and is usually mounted on the helmet. Construction Housings Several materials are used for housings. Injection moulded plastics are most popular for the low end and some of the more powerful lights produced in large quantities. Low volume products and home built lights are generally machined from aluminium alloy or high grade engineering plastics such as acetal (Delrin), or occasionally stainless steel, brass or bronze. Lenses (ports) are usually high grade transparent plastic or toughened glass. O-ring seals are standard for sealing joints and connections and for sealing penetrations through the watertight housing for switch controls. Power supply Alkaline batteries, zinc-carbon batteries, Nickel–metal hydride batteries (NiMH), lithium-ion batteries, lead-acid batteries, and surface supply by cable are commonly used as power supply. Voltage depends on the requirements of the specific light source and usually ranges from 1.2V for a single NiMH cell, to 12V for a lead-acid accumulator. Surface powered helmet lights may use 24 or 36V power supplies. High voltage is not generally used except in the final stage of the HID circuit, for safety reasons. Switching Lights which must be switched on or off underwater require a switch which is unaffected by the pressure and is waterproof. *Magnetic switches have the advantage of working through the housing without requiring a penetration, but can affect a compass which may be relied on for navigation. The magnet is held in an external slider or bezel, and may rust if exposed to water. *Toggle switches with rubber mouldings that go completely over the toggle lever and seal to the housing have been used for both production and custom lights. *External levers operating internal switches via a rotating shaft sealed with O-rings are also used. *Push-buttons can be used but must be spring-loaded sufficiently to compensate for the external pressure. This is usually done by using a small diameter pushrod with O-ring seals, and a moderate strength spring. On the outside a broad mushroom head is used for comfort. *Screw-on end covers are common. This is almost always the cover that is removed to change batteries, so it has to be removable and well sealed anyway. This end of the light is screwed further onto the body to make contact between the battery and a contact. Barrel seal O-rings are used to prevent leakage while allowing the cover to move axially to close the contact. Double O-rings are more reliable as if the first one leaks the second is a backup. This type of switch is best operated as seldom as possible underwater and is often not very convenient to use, being relatively stiff, sometimes needing both hands to operate. Accessories Technical divers often use a Goodman type handle to carry a light on the back of the hand, so the hand can be used without dropping the light. This handle type was originally rigid, and used to carry a canister light head, but is now also used for small one piece lights. Derivatives use bungee to hold the light in place, or are made of soft material and worn like a glove. These are variously referred to as glove handles, Goodman gloves, hands-free light holders, or soft hand mounts.

Cave divers frequently choose narrow beam lights when diving in good visibility as these provide good illumination over relatively long distances, which is useful when navigating into an unfamiliar space where it is actually possible to see a fairly long distance ahead. Some feel that in poor visibility, or at short range, a narrow beam is not much use, and a wider beam spreads the light over a more useful area. Others feel that in low visibility settings a wide beam angle is distracting as it tends to reflect back to much light from floating particulates (back-scatter). Video lighting usually requires a wider beam as the view angle of the video camera must be accommodated for good results. In the case of very wide angle video, such as the GoPro and similar, an extremely wide angle beam is necessary. Beam angle may be as tight as 8 to 10 degrees in extreme cases, or as wide as around 140° with a plain flat glass port. Even wider angles are possible (exceeding 180°) with a domed port on the light, or a \\"test tube\\" light without reflector. LED lights usually use an internal \\"lens\\" to produce a focused beam. This actually focuses the beam by internal reflection on a parabolic surface. Several lens options may be available for different beam angles for a given LED, but most models of light use only the one chosen by the manufacturer. A few underwater lights have a focusing facility by which the beam angle can be adjusted. There are two ways this can be done, depending on the basic emission pattern of the light source. HID lights, which generally produce non-directional light, are usually focused by a reflector, which can be slid longitudinally over the light. They produce a beam with a central bright area and a diffuse general illumination around it. This is good for illuminating a combination of near and far areas at the same time, but not good for wide angle video, as the hot- spot will confuse the automatic exposure software and the result is generally overexposure in the hot spot and underexposure around it. Other lights use a lens system over the front of the light, which may be focused by axial movement of the lens, which may be on a screw thread for fine control.

Both are switched on by screwing the back end cover clockwise to close an internal contact. Function Primary, backup, video light Primary Usually a powerful light suited to the planned activity of the dive, with sufficient power and suitable beam angle. The beam angle and light output required depend on the objectives of the dive. Backup Backup lights are carried in case the primary light fails during the dive. This is particularly important in cave and wreck penetration diving, where the light is required to facilitate navigation out of the enclosed space. Cave divers are trained to carry three dive lights as a result of an accident analysis by Sheck Exley published in 1977. Video lights Video lights are a special application. They are generally not important for dive safety, but are required for the video camera to get an acceptable image quality, either for video recording, or for the surface team to monitor the work done by the diver. Modern underwater video lights are now relatively small, have run times of 45–60 minutes and output 600-8000 lumens. These LED lights are powered by Lithium-ion batteries and usually have a 5600K (daylight) color temperature.

Background The United States and Israel do not have a formal treaty of alliance, as the US does with other nations, and it is under no obligation to come to Israel's defense. However, the US does refer to Israel and other nations without treaties as allies.War talk on Iran forces the issue: Is Israel a formal US ally?, Christian Science Monitor, March 2, 2012. The US has supported Israel with foreign aid, providing nearly $3 billion in grants annually to Israel since 1985; Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of US foreign aid since World War II.U.S. Foreign Aid to Israel (Adapted from the summary of a report by Jeremy M. Sharp, specialist in Middle Eastern Affairs. September 16, 2010) Israel applied to join the US government's Visa Waiver Program in 2005. The program permits citizens of selected countries to enter the US for up to 90 days without having to apply for an entry visa. The Senate rejected the bid because not all Israeli citizens own a biometric passport, the entry visa rejection rate for Israelis exceeded 3%, and Israel insists on stricter security checks for Palestinian Americans than other American citizens.Yitzhak Benhorin, US Congress to debate visa exemption for Israelis, Ynetnews, January 11, 2013. Israeli officials state that US citizens are free to travel to Israel. However, many Americans with Muslim or Arab names have been turned away from Israel without explanation. The US State Department states that \\"U.S. citizens whom Israeli authorities suspect of being of Arab, Middle Eastern, or Muslim origin\\" may be denied \\"entry or exit without explanation.\\" Provisions/Elements of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source.Information may be found through a Congress.gov search of \\"United States–Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2013\\". In both the House and Senate versions the bill declares that Israel is a major strategic partner of the United States. It amends the Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act of 2012 to extend authority to add to foreign-based defense stockpiles and transfer obsolete or surplus United States Department of Defense items to Israel. It authorizes the United States President to carry out US-Israel cooperative activities, including in the fields of energy, water, homeland security, cyber-security, agriculture, and alternative fuel technologies, as well as renewable energy or energy efficiency. It also urges the President to provide assistance for enhancement of rocket defense systems. The House version states that it shall be US policy to include Israel in the visa waiver program when Israel satisfies such program's inclusion requirements. The Senate version specifies that satisfaction of the requirements regarding reciprocal travel privileges for U.S. citizens would be subject to security concerns. Procedural history In the House of Representatives, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen (R-FL) introduced the bill H.R.938 on March 4, 2013. It currently has 182 cosponsors and has been referred to the House Subcommittee on Immigration And Border Security.Congress.gov search of \\"United States–Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014\\", H.R.938. In the Senate, Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) introduced the bill S.462 on March 5, 2013. It had 63 cosponsors and has been referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. The Bill was read twice and did not reach the Senate floor.OpenCongress, \\"United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2013\\", S. 462. Public perception The bills have been promoted by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (\\"AIPAC\\"), including at its annual conference in March 2013.Ron Kampeas, In U.S. fight over visa waiver exemption for Israel, both sides cite discrimination, Jewish Telegraphic Agency, April 15, 2013.Strengthen US-Israel strategic cooperation web page on American Israel Public Affairs Committee website, accessed April 16, 2013. AIPAC says that the bill's designation of Israel as a major strategic ally would be beneficial to the United States, as the \\"Middle East [is] in turmoil.\\" AIPAC says that it is therefore important for America to \\"strengthen our alliance with friendly and reliable states,\\" with Israel being such a state. The American Jewish Committee supports both versions of the bill as well.Take Action: Enhance U.S.-Israel Strategic Partnership web page on American Jewish Committee website, accessed April 16, 2013. An assistant legislative director at the American Jewish Committee stated that Israel had a \\"relatively low visa refusal rate,\\" despite heavy screening and security procedures. Responding to concerns about Israeli Arabs posing a security risk to the United States, the AJC said such concerns \\"were overblown.\\" Representative Brad Sherman argued that there exist at least five other countries with a visa refusal rate of over 3% which were allowed into the program, and these rates were higher than Israel's 5.4% refusal rate. He added that he believes that accepting Israel to the visa waiver program wouldn't cause discrimination, but rather end it, and criticized opponents of the bill as members of a campaign to delegitimize the state of Israel. Lara Friedman of Americans for Peace Now wrote that the bill \\"takes the extraordinary step of seeking to change the current U.S. law to create a special and unique exception for Israel in U.S. immigration law.\\"Lara Friedman, APN Legislative Round-Up: Week Ending 3/8/13, Americans for Peace Now web site, March 8, 2013, accessed April 17, 2013. James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, has lobbied against the Senate language, and said passage of such a law would codify discriminatory treatment.

The other side, the free-staters, soon gained control of the town and it was loyal to the Union when the Civil War broke out in 1861. Potosi was located along the north bank of Mine Creek and it was along the military road running from Fort Leavenworth to Fort Gibson. At its height the town had thirty residents, a store and a post office. William G. Cutler, History of the State of Kansas (Chicago: A. T. Andreas, 1883), pp. 1106-7, 1116. In December 1861 a group of 120 men loyal to the Confederacy raided Potosi, basically pillaging most or all of its buildings. Camp Defiance was established northeast of Potosi soon after. Later, a group of Union soldiers was stationed at Potosi to protect it. The first time they were mentioned was in August 1863.Charles M. Chase, letter to the Republican, August 17, 1863, pp. 3-5 (in the Manuscript Div. of the Kansas State Historical Society, Topeka, Kans.). Troops continued to stay at Potosi until October 1864. One report said twenty- five troops were at the post. In October Confederate Maj. Gen. Sterling Price and about 10,000 troops were in Missouri on a raid and were moving west toward Kansas. The troops were removed to join the Union forces meeting Price. On October 25, 1864, the Battle of Mine Creek took place about three miles to the west of Potosi.

The old mosque building had to be torn down for the road construction work. Current building The new building of Taipei Cultural Mosque was designed by architect Huang Mo-chun. Nevertheless, the new mosque went through several renovations, in which it was rebuilt into its current five-story building in 1983. By then, the mosque was inaugurated during a ceremony attended by the Ambassador of Saudi Arabia to the Republic of China, Asaad Abdul Aziz AI- Zuhair. In 1990, Xiao died and his son, Xiao Weijun (蕭偉君) assumed the imam position left by his father. Another renovation was made again in the same year with the help of Indonesia Economic and Trade Office to Taipei, and the latest renovation was made in April 2010. Activities Prayer times clocks at the mosque. Unlike the Taipei Grand Mosque whose daily operation fund is heavily supported by the ROC Government and the Kuomintang, the Taipei Cultural Mosque relies heavily on private donation, this making them a purely \\"civilian mosque\\" whose members do not cooperate seriously with the authorities, but concentrate on religious affairs. Consequently, members of Taipei Cultural Mosque accuses supporters of Taipei Grand Mosque of being too political with lack of pure Islamic faith. When imams from Taipei Cultural Mosque practice religious activities, they often adopt some Han Chinese traditions, such as holding incense, visiting graves, receiving money for reciting Quran etc. After an administrator eventually died, the Taipei Cultural Mosque went into decline. Now only few Muslims practice prayer in the mosque with some foreign workers and students from South East Asia and South Asia go there for some group activities. Taipei Cultural Mosque serves as the headquarters of Chinese Muslim Youth League. It also houses the Taiwan Halal Integrity Development Association. Architecture Taipei Cultural Mosque prayer hall The five-story building of Taipei Cultural Mosque is a combination of Islamic traditional culture and modern architecture. Now the building has become the hub for religious and cultural activities for Muslims in Taiwan.

Based on the 2010 novel Aging Family by Cheon Myeong-kwan, the film is about three misfit siblings with an average age of 39 who all decide to move back in with their mother. Plot Film director In-mo (Park Hae-il) is a 40-year-old movie director who's been jobless for the past decade after his debut film was a commercial and artistic flop. Mired in poverty and depressed at his wife's affair, he decides to hang himself. But a well-timed call from his mother (Youn Yuh-jung) inviting him to dinner results in a change of plans. Instead of killing himself, he decides to move into his mother's home, where his older brother Han-mo (Yoon Je-moon) also lives. A 44-year-old unemployed ex-gangster with five criminal convictions, Han-mo is not particularly pleased at this development. But more trouble lies ahead: younger sister Mi-yeon (Gong Hyo-jin) arrives with her bratty, rebellious 15-year-old daughter Min-kyung (Jin Ji-hee). 35-year-old Mi-yeon announces that she is leaving her second husband, and that she needs to stay with them for the immediate future. Thus the dysfunctional family is reunited, revealing petty conflicts, sibling rivalries and largely unexpressed affection, as they struggle with the challenges of middle age.

The tower has 447 residential units on 42 floors, and 25,000 square feet of amenity space. History As part of the Rincon Hill Plan adopted in August 2005, the parcels at 375 Fremont and 399 Fremont were zoned for either two residential towers, or one tower. On June 15, 2006, the San Francisco Planning Commission approved the demolition of the existing buildings and the construction of a residential tower by developer Fifield Realty Corp. Initially designed by Richard Keating Architecture, the development was approved for 432 residential units with 432 parking spaces in four underground levels. The project was marketed as The Californian on Rincon Hill by Fifield. By 2007, however, Fifield was reportedly looking to sell the development. Demolition of the existing buildings took place in February 2008. In 2009, Fifield changed the name of the project to Echelon on Rincon Hill. After two years without starting construction, the Planning Commission granted a 12-month extension of its approvals until June 15, 2009. The extension also increased the number of allowed units to 452, while decreasing the number of parking spaces to 238. Additional 12-month extensions were granted in 2009, 2010, and 2011. In 2012, developers OliverMcMillanOliverMcMillan Profile and UDR acquired the project from Fifield. After being redesigned by Solomon Cordwell Buenz, another 12-month extension was granted, expiring June 15, 2013. In January 2013, UDR acquired OliverMcMillan's remaining 7.5% stake in the project. The total cost of the land parcel was US$52.2 million. In December 2013, UDR announced a joint-venture agreement with MetLife to develop the US$317 million project, with UDR retaining a 51 percent ownership interest and MetLife owning 49 percent. According to planning documents, the building will rise to the roof line, exclusive of mechanical screening structures, which makes the tower's total height somewhat taller. Building permits were issued in June 2013. Construction began in January 2014. General Contractor Swinerton, completed the building in April 2016. 399 Fremont is a luxury apartment home community owned and managed by UDR, featuring upscale apartments and on-site amenities including fitness center, lap pool, and resident media lounge.

History  Google opened up Google Map Maker, a public cartography project, to a collaborative community effort in certain territories in June, 2008. Bangladesh was open for editing on 28 September 2008. Mapping Bangladesh community was co-founded by Google and Altaf-Uz-Zaman on 17 January 2012. Afterwards, it started working with a view to uniting all mappers (citizen cartographers) across the country under one community. The community aimed at teaching citizen cartographers how to map features on Map Maker, provided a ground for discussion about local conventions and engaged in discussions about how to best represent the country digitally to the world by means of Google Maps. Many of the Internet users in Bangladesh do not have mastery of English, as such many of the local mappers could not follow the Map Maker Help section in English given by Map Maker. Being the first ever Map Maker based community in Bangladesh, Mapping Bangladesh created a site composed fully in local language (Bengali) with illustrated tutorials, pictorials and videos for mappers to understand better how Map Maker works and how to use this online tool. Creation of the local Map Maker based tutorial site led to some serious mapping activity across the country increasing the number of members of the community from just a few to several hundred as of 2013. Mapping Bangladesh community is praised and claimed to be one of the most organized mapping communities across Map Maker by other country-based Google Map Maker Communities.  Vision  To develop the most detailed digital map of Bangladesh on Google Maps with as much accuracy as possible gathering local knowledge of everyone from across the country under one community.  Type of activity  Mapping Bangladesh focuses on digital mapping using the online based mapping tool by Google Inc. called Google Map Maker (GMM). Users require a computer, broadband internet, spare time and knowledge of their respective neighborhood to be able to contribute to Google Maps of Bangladesh. They can add or edit features on Map Maker as well as review features edited by others using only their local knowledge.  Regional Expert Reviewers (RERs)  Regional Expert Reviewers (RERs) earn their appointed positions by making an impressive number of high quality contributions to Google's base map, and by actively participating with Google and other mappers on Google's Map Your World discussion forums. They hold reviewing/moderation power on Google Map Maker within their respective assigned territories, which means they can approve or deny an entry on Map Maker which would be reflected directly on Google Maps. Each Regional Expert Reviewer is hand-picked by the Google team and/or sometimes nominated by existing RERs and Map Maker Country Advocates. Bangladesh had the last RER promotion on 1 October 2012, and the RER Program of the Google Map Maker Team was declared closed soon after, meaning there would be no more additions to the RER pool. Existing RERs however, still retain their elevated trust levels in their trust regions, their badges and close engagement with the Google Map Maker team. Bangladesh has 13 Regional Expert Reviewers, everyone being a member of Mapping Bangladesh.  Improving Bangladesh maps  Mapping Bangladesh, by a collaborative effort, added all government healthcare facilities across the country in all 485 sub-districts (locally: Upazila, ). They have also demarcated all 64 Districts and 485 Sub-Districts, hence completing the entire District and Sub-District layer of Google Maps on Map Maker with the help of LGED (Local Government Engineering Department) Maps.LGED Website During the Map Maker APAC Regional Conference 2012 at Hyderabad, India in 2012, where Mapping Bangladesh community attended as well - the Google Map Maker Team expressed their surprise and gratitude for being able to stay organized and able to complete the project. The community has also marked all Railway stations across the country. Having these major projects succeeded and praised by Google Map Maker communities, the community is now working at a local level on other projects adding business listings, neighborhoods, ferry terminals and routes, roads, ports, rivers and everything that Map Maker interface and policies (see Terms of Service) allows them to add to Google Maps. Activities in 2012 An event of Mapping Bangladesh in Mymensingh Mapping Bangladesh initiated their forum and site in January 2012. The same year in March, Google transferred ownership of Bangladesh mapping to local RERs (Regional Expert Reviewers). The community joined Google Map Your World community in April and later on in July, opened their own chapter on Map Makerpedia, the crowd-sourced guide for Map Maker users. In August, Map Maker team created new default road speeds specifically for Bangladesh, a privilege only a few Map Maker enabled countries are claimed to have till today. The community published their first forum-newsletter in September which was claimed to be the first ever endeavor to publish a community-based newsletter by any community across Google Map Maker. They also completed the entire Sub- District layer of Bangladesh on Google Maps in November the same year. The first ever Google MapUpIntroduction to MapUps event in Bangladesh called MapUp Rangpur was hosted by the community in Rangpur on 23 November 2012. Different media of the country have seen the event to be a milestone for Bangladesh and bringing the country another step closer to reaching the Vision 2021 envisioned by the government. In honor of Map Maker contributors in Bangladesh, Google Map Maker team has published 4 time-lapse videos till date featuring Rangpur, Dhaka, Bogra and Chittagong. \\\\- cities where the RERs (Power Mappers) are mostly based. Activities in 2013 The community participated in Bangladesh Smartphone Expo 2013. They also hosted the second Google MapUphttp://www.kalerkantho.com/?view=details&type;=gold&data;=news&pub;_no=1149&cat;_id=1&menu;_id=61&news;_type_id=1&index;=0&archiev;=yes&arch;_date=10-02-2013 event in Bangladesh at Dhaka on 9 February 2013. Their main objectives in 2013 are to host Google MapUp events across the country and teach people with internet how to contribute to the first digital map of the country on Google Maps with their local knowledge. Following the vision, they have organized 17 more MapUps across the country in Chittagong, Rangpur, Comilla, Kushtia, Khulna and in different public and private universities in Dhaka.ম্যাপিং বাংলাদেশ কমিউনিটির ওয়েবসাইট চালু - টেক শহরম্যাপিং বাংলাদেশ কমিউনিটির অফিসিয়াল ওয়েবসাইট উন্মুক্ত :: দৈনিক ইত্তেফাকওয়েবে ম্যাপিং বাংলাদেশ কমিউনিটি  References   External links  * Mapping Bangladesh Official Site Category:Clubs and societies in Bangladesh Category:Organizations established in 2012 Category:Google Maps ","title":"Mapping Bangladesh"},{"id":"39135924","text":"Donwood may refer to: *Donwood, West Virginia, an unincorporated community and coal town in Kanawha County *Stanley Donwood, the pen name of English writer Dan Rickwood ","title":"Donwood"},{"id":"39135930","text":"In curling, a third (alternatively, vice, vice-skip or mate) is the team member who delivers the second-to-last pair of a team's stones in an end.

It is the fourth mosque to be built in Taiwan. History After fleeing Mainland China with the Nationalist Government at the end of Chinese Civil War in 1949, some Chinese Muslims resided in Tianzhong, Changhua. To accommodate theirs needs to pray, Muslims did their prayers in some houses. One notable house used for prayer was the house of Qi Yulao (耆于老). When their number grew bigger, such venues could no longer accommodate all of them. First building Taichung Mosque first building Ever since, they started to plan to build a mosque in 1951 with funds raised from various sources, including the government of Saudi Arabia. They chose the Japanese-style house at the No. 12, Lane 165, Zhongxiao Road (忠孝路), South District as the location for the Taichung Mosque. The size of the mosque was 130 square meter. Following a visit by the Minister of Transport of Saudi Arabia in April 1975 who found the mosque to be in a complete disrepair, funds were provided to the Chinese Muslim Association to establish a new Taichung Mosque at a new site. Current building Due to financial difficulties, the new Taichung Mosque construction project was temporarily halted until May 1989 before it proceeded again until its completion in August 1990. With additional buildings and hardware, the entire construction project of the mosque was completed in 1994 which resulted the current mosque building used today at Dadun South Road (大燉南路). Activities Five daily prayers are regularly held at the mosque, including the Eid prayers. The library of Taichung Mosque is used to host many activities to inform the general public about Islam. In 1997, the mosque hired Shan Yaowu (閃耀武), a Chinese Muslim from Myanmar, as the imam of the mosque. He graduated from Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt studying Islamic law. His duty was to conduct religious affairs and missionary activities. During his term, he vigorously promoted visionary works. He spent four years preaching over 50 Friday prayer sermons and then edited some of the sermons into books which were sent to each mosque throughout Taiwan. In May 2003, the mosque hired Bao Xiaolin (保孝廉), a graduate from the Missionary Department of the Islamic University of Madinah in Saudi Arabia, as the vice president in charge of conducting religious affairs. He encouraged young Taiwanese Muslim to come to the mosque to study the Quran and Arabic during holidays and weekends. He worked tirelessly to improve Taichung Muslims' knowledge on Islamic culture. Architecture Taichung Mosque prayer hall After the new board of mosque reelection in 1990, they made some expansion to the mosque, which includes a three-story building, Islamic shop, Islamic restaurant, suites and dormitories for imams, classrooms and Muslim cemetery. Transportation Taichung Mosque is accessible within walking distance North from Daqing Station of Taiwan Railways. In the future, the mosque will be closer served from Nantun Station of the Taichung Metro.

Career Nicholson worked at Merrill Lynch and J.P. Morgan in New York City before moving to Hong Kong in 2002 to take up a position as Credit Suisse First Boston's Asia-ex-Japan head of equity capital markets. In 2005, he transferred to the Macquarie Group, where he held the position of head of China equity capital markets; his hiring was part of a large recruitment drive which saw Macquarie poach Hong Kong-based ECM staff from a number of major banks. In January 2007, Nicholson left Macquarie, one of several senior ECM bankers resigning at the time. He joined BOC International as vice-chairman of the investment banking division, one of the first senior foreign executives at any Chinese bank. At BOCI, he served as advisor on a number of major deals, including Rusal's initial public offering on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 2010. Nicholson's strategy after he joined involved a \\"build out\\" of the ECM business and the institutional equities franchise. In 2005, two years before he joined, BOCI led no equity offerings at all, and only seven in 2006; in 2008 through 2010, in contrast, it led sixty-five. In February 2012, Nicholson resigned from his post at BOCI. He then became a managing director at China International Capital Corp, the first joint venture investment bank in China. He resigned from CICC in June 2014. In March 2015, Nicholson took a new post at Nomura's Hong Kong office as head of Asia-ex-Japan equity capital markets. As of December 2017 he remained in that position. Personal life Nicholson did his bachelor's and master's degree in chemical engineering at New York City's Columbia University, and went on to earn a Master of Business Administration from the University of Virginia Darden School of Business. He married a Hong Kong woman in 2003. Nicholson applied to the Hong Kong Immigration Department for naturalisation as a Chinese citizen; as the Nationality Law of the People's Republic of China does not permit applicants for naturalisation to retain their former citizenships, he renounced U.S. citizenship on 12 April 2013 at the U.S. Consulate-General in Hong Kong. Nicholson stated that he had chosen to naturalise in order to \\"make my situation reflect my personal and professional view of my long-term interests\\". Colleagues suggested his motivations included convenience of travel to mainland China in order to visit clients, since only Hong Kong residents of Chinese nationality and not other nationalities are eligible for Home Return Permits. Peter Thal Larsen analysed Nicholson's choice as a career move intended to demonstrate to clients that he saw Hong Kong as his home and was not using it as a stepping-stone to opportunities in London or New York like many other expatriate bankers.

Hockett St. in Porterville, California. History The house was built by John Zalud, a Porterville businessman, in 1891. Architects Hugh and John Templeton designed the building in the Second Empire style; the house is the only Second Empire home in Porterville. The design includes a mansard roof with decorated dormer windows, a front porch with wooden ornamentation, and tall double-hung sash windows on the front and sides. While the house was built in brick, a departure from the standard wood construction of Second Empire buildings, it uses wood extensively in its detailing. In 1977, the city of Porterville converted the house to a museum. The Zalud House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 31, 1987. On television On December 10, 2016, the Zalud House was the featured as a lockdown location on a season 13 episode of Ghost Adventures, where a 'cursed chair' in an upstairs bedroom caused visitors to have chest pains. In 1917, orange grower William Brookes (John Zalud's son-in-law) was murdered in this chair while sitting in the lobby of the former Pioneer Hotel. He was shot four times and killed by a married woman named Julia Howe, who didn't like what he was saying about her after bragging he had an affair with her.

The language (defined by Michael Pasternak during his work on oVirt RESTful API) allows documenting the model of the resource(s) provided by a service, the relationships between them, and operations and the parameters that must be supplied for the operations. It specifies if parameters are mandated; and describes possible overloads as parameters sets. RSDL is intended to simplify the reuse of web services that are based on the HTTP architecture of the web. It is platform- and language-independent and aims to promote reuse of applications beyond the basic use in a web browser by both humans and machines. Unlike WADL, it concentrates on describing URIs as stand- alone entry points in to the application which can be invoked in different ways, does not require traversing over URI components to figure out URI structure, and supports URI/Headers/body parameters overloads. This makes it human-readable and easily consumed by both humans and machines.  Concept   Self descriptive  RSDL represents different URIs as stand-alone entry points into the application. Following resource URIs, one can figure out which methods are available for the given resources and how those resources can be consumed.  Machine-readable  Each URI in RSDL contains all the necessary information to generate an HTTP request from it, which can be easily consumed by accessing the URI internals.  Human-readable  Each URI in RSDL contains \\"rel\\" and \\"description\\" attributes describing the meaning of the given operation on that URI. Humans can easily fetch all available operations for a given collection/resource simply by locating different descriptors within the same URI.  Format  api.xsd GETPOSTPUTDELETE... ...

Scotland and Scots were heavily entangled in both the diplomatic and military events centred on the Holy Roman Empire. There were a number of reasons for this participation. Among these, the fate of the Scottish princess Elizabeth of Bohemia (daughter of King James VI & I) proved to be a key concern. Up to 50,000 Scottish troops arrived on the continent having been levied on warrants issued by the Privy Council and countersigned by their king, usually at periods corresponding to the participation of a particular ally in a campaign against the Habsburgs. They mostly served initially in established Scottish brigades in the Dutch Republic and Sweden which had existed before 1618. Later, specially commissioned army groups were also created in Denmark-Norway and France to facilitate further Scottish participation. Some fought for better prospects, some for kin loyalty, not a few for dynastic and confessional considerations. A few, the minority, were plain mercenaries. Although Scots participated from the start of the war until the end, formal participation by the nation was limited. Scotland formally declared war on Spain (1625–1630) and France (1627–1629), but for the most part, Scots engaged in foreign service with consent from their monarch and under warrants issued by the Privy Council but in armies commanded by their European allies. Through such service a number of ambitious individual Scots in different European courts had a profound influence on the course of the war both conducting diplomacy and commanding entire army groups in the campaign.Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, Alexander Leslie and the Scottish Geneals of the Thirty Years' War, 1618–1648 (Pickering & Chatto, London, 2014). These included General Sir James Spens of Wormiston, Lieutenant General Patrick Ruthven, Lieutenant General James King and Field Marshal Alexander Leslie who all served in Sweden. These men were joined in Germany by an auxiliary army with Scots and English under notional Swedish command and led by James, 3rd Marquis Hamilton (1631–1632). In France the main officers were Marechal de France John Hepburn (1634–1636), a former colonel in Swedish service, and Sir Robert Moray (1640s). In Denmark Robert Maxwell Earl of Nithsdale led a contingent including Donald Mackay Lord Reay and Colonel Robert Monro and Alexander Lindsay, 2nd Lord Spynie among others (1627–1629). The Scots Brigade, which had existed since 1572, was another outlet for Scottish soldiers looking for service in Continental armies. Although in the service and under the payroll of the States-General of the Dutch Republic, these troops were, first and foremost, loyal to the House of Stuart. Nonetheless, Scottish soldiers may have chosen to serve in the Republic due to their religious beliefs, perhaps as part of movement of \\"Calvinist Internationalism.\\" Notable officers include Colonel William Brog, William Balfour, James Livingston, 1st Earl of Callendar, and several generations of the Lords and Earls of Buccleuch. Notable engagements during their service in the Eighty Years' War include the Battle of Nieuwpoort (1600), the Siege of Ostend (1601-1604), the War of the Jülich Succession (1609-1610), the Siege of Bergen-op-Zoom (1622), the Siege of 's-Hertogenbosch (1629), and the Siege of Breda (1637), among countless others. It is important to remember that not all Scots fought for or believed in the cause of either Elizabeth of Bohemia or the Protestant northern alliances. A number fought for the Habsburgs (Austrian and Spanish) for the same complex reasons as their countrymen; there were some committed to the counter-reformation, some compelled by circumstance and some opportunists such as Albrecht von Wallenstein's assassin, Count Walter Leslie.David Worthington, Scots in Habsburg Service, 1618–1648 (Leiden, 2003) Scottish people of the Thirty Years' War The assassination of Albrecht von Wallenstein by the Scottish and Irish officers led by Colonel Walter Leslie General Leslie Many noted Scots participated in the Thirty Years' War or had strong interests in it, including: Scottish monarchs and royalty * James VI & I – King of Scotland (1567–1625) & England and Ireland (1603–1625) * Elizabeth of Bohemia – Daughter of James VI.

These veterans played an important role in training the Covenanter recruits. However, more senior officers including Lieutenant General Patrick Ruthven, Lieutenant General James King, Major General John Ruthven also returned to confront their former comrades. Both Covenanters and Royalists returned with cohorts of officers, and both introduced the 'Swedish Discipline' into their respective armies. When the wars spread to England, a situation arose in 1644 where the senior commander of the parliamentary allied army was Alexander Leslie, Earl of Leven while his opposition was led by Patrick Ruthven, now Earl of Forth and Lord General of the Royalist forces in England.Steve Murdoch and Alexia Grosjean, Alexander Leslie and the Scottish Generals, chapters 5 and 6.

Design details The M70 is a recoil-operated, single-action, pistol. This model differs most significantly from the locked-breech M57 by employing simple blowback, as this method is suitable for less powerful ammunition. Other differences from the parent M57 are found in the safety mechanisms, with both a manual safety lever and a magazine disconnect being present. The manual safety lever is located on the left side of the frame, above the grip panel, and flips forward to fire and back to engage the safety. Owing to its Tokarev design lineage, the pistol is easy to dissemble and the hammer assembly is removable as one piece. The sights are fixed, with the rear sight being drift-adjustable for windage. Users For many years these pistols were used by Yugoslavian police and military. Today many of these pistols are sold worldwide as surplus and are popular among civilians in Serbia, sometimes referred as \\"Pčelica\\" (little bee), as well as backup guns for police.

It focuses on the Start menu, File Explorer and Internet Explorer — three major components of the Windows shell. In particular, it can serve as a Start menu replacement for Windows 8 and Windows 10 systems. Developed by Ivo Beltchev, it was first released in 2009, and has been downloaded hundreds of millions of times since.Classic Shell page at FossHub showing downloads Development by Beltchev has ceased, and the project's source code has been released. Development has been picked up by volunteers on GitHub under the name Open Shell.Open Shell  Features and architecture  Classic Shell is packaged as a suite of three components, all optional and independent of each other: * Classic Start Menu — A re-implementation of the Start Menu, replicating features from several different generations of Windows * Classic Explorer — An add-on to File/Windows Explorer, restoring and extending features present in various Windows releases * Classic IE — An add-on for Internet Explorer 9 and later, it restores the web page title to the window title bar, and various details to the status bar Classic Shell is programmed in C++. Although it modifies Windows behaviors, it does not do so by modifying or tweaking Windows registry settings or replacing or patching system files — all modifications are done using Windows APIs. It is localized into more than 30 languages, including right-to-left support for Arabic and Hebrew.  Classic Start Menu  Classic Start Menu is a replacement for the Windows Start Menu. Features include: * Customize appearance of the Start button and Start Menu, and menu and submenu items * Show recently, or most frequently used, apps * Show recently opened documents, with sorting, jumplists, and pinning * Highlight newly installed programs * Separate traditional desktop apps from Universal Windows Platform apps * Sort menus alphabetically, by date, or custom order with drag-and-drop * Windows Search integration * Customize settings such as menu opening delay, tooltip timing, sub-menu column style, menu width, icon size, animation, scroll speed, font smoothing, etc. * Skinning to more completely customize the appearance * Scales icons and menu background to higher resolutions and/or pixel density (PPI) Besides restoring past behavior, there are several new features. These include showing the menu next to the taskbar when it is vertical, multi-monitor support, launching multiple programs at once, custom shutdown-related actions, Universal app launching, expanding any file folder as cascading menus, and additional keyboard shortcuts. The search box can search the system path, can show partial matches, and can show all results inside the menu. Classic Start Menu can also modify Windows 8's new UI features, such as hot corners only on the desktop without disabling them inside Universal apps.  Classic Explorer  Classic Explorer is an add-on to Windows File Explorer, implemented as various shell extensions. It does not replace . Features include: * A toolbar that can include built-in commands, custom commands, or dropdown menus for arbitrary folders. * Customize the behavior and appearance of the left folder navigation pane, including whether folders expand with a single click or double click, connecting lines, subfolder indicators, horizontal scrollbar, tree item spacing, and keyboard shortcuts * The breadcrumb bar can be replaced with a traditional address bar, and the associated dropdown modified to show the hierarchical path instead of recent folder history * Sort headers in all views * Overlay icon for network shares * Status bar can show disk free space, total size of current folder * Tooltip of selected item * \\"Up\\" folder navigation button * Show the current folder in the title bar caption * Copy progress dialog can be automatically expanded to show more details * Replace the copy conflict dialog with one like Windows XP  History  Classic Shell began as a tool for personal use, and saw its first public release in 2009. Over time, the Start Menu component evolved to be a customizable launcher that also integrated a search box and other features of the Windows 7 Start Menu. The Explorer and IE components appeared later. While earlier versions were compatible with Windows Vista and later, versions since 3.9.0 no longer support Windows Vista/Server 2008. Classic Shell was never popular or necessary on Vista in the first place because Vista, like XP, came with the ability to revert to a classic start menu. Classic Shell is released as free and open-source under the MIT license. Founder Ivo Beltchev announced the end of development in December 2017.Classic Shell no longer in development. Source code released Classic Shell has picked up development once again under the name Open Shell and has been actively maintained and developed since 2018. Open-Shell has not been given any new features, but has fixed many bugs and issues, most caused by new feature releases of Windows 10. Reception Classic Shell was a fairly popular interface enhancement in the Windows 7 life cycle but became much more widely used after the release and negative reception of Windows 8 (with its lack of a Start menu). It has seen coverage in such publications as Forbes, Lifehacker, Neowin, Ghacks, ZDNet, PC World, TechRepublic, MakeUseOf, and Betanews.

Rabbi Blane, a Universalist rabbi and cantor, conducts his teaching and pastoral work online. He is the founder and dean of the Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute, an online, one-year rabbinical school, and founder and spiritual leader of Sim Shalom Synagogue, an interactive Universalist cyber- synagogue that offers live weeknight and Shabbat synagogue services to an international community via computer hookup. In addition to his work as a rabbi and cantor, Blane is a recording artist singer-songwriter. He writes and performs in the Americana/Folk/Rock genres. He sings, plays guitar, piano and ukulele. Blane has recorded three albums. A fourth album \\" I Confess\\" is scheduled for release in December 2016. \\" I Confess\\" was produced at Dark Star in TN with famed Christian, Country and Rock music producer Billy Smiley. Biography Blane was raised in an Orthodox family in Jersey City, New Jersey. He attended elementary and junior high school at the Yeshiva of Hudson County and had an Orthodox bar mitzvah. He attended the Rogosin Yeshiva High School run by the Lubavitch movement in Jersey City. He earned a B.A. in music education from Jersey City State College. After graduation he worked as an actor and singer on and off-Broadway. He wrote and produced Benjamin Poe, a 1981 off-off-Broadway musical thriller. He also co-founded Blane & DeRosa Productions and also produced children's book recordings and audiobooks for the Scholastic Corporation, Random House and other publishers. At age 34 Blane undertook private studies to become a cantor and was accepted into the Cantors Assembly, the association of Conservative cantors. From 1994 to 1998 he served as the cantor of the First Hebrew Congregation of Peekskill, New York, a Conservative congregation, and also served as that congregation's spiritual leader from 1997 to 1998. In 1996 he was the cantor of Temple Beth Haverim of Mahwah, New Jersey, a Reform congregation. From 1999 to 2006 he was the cantor of Congregation Beth Israel of Northern Valley, Bergenfield, New Jersey, a Conservative congregation. From 2006 to 2009 he officiated as rabbi and cantor at Congregation Beth Tikvah/New Milford Jewish Center. Blane received his rabbinic ordination in June 2001 from Rabbi Joseph Gelberman of the Rabbinical Seminary International in New York City. He chose this trans-denominational seminary for its short ordination time (two years) as opposed to five years at the Reform Hebrew Union College and four years at the nondenominational Academy for Jewish Religion. His experience pursuing his ordination influenced his development of the Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute, whose graduates are \\"not necessarily trying to minister to mainstream communities ... [and] are not likely to be accepted by some of the mainstream Jewish world, either\\". Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute Blane founded the Jewish Spiritual Leaders Institute in New York City in 2010. The rabbinical program for Jewish Professionals is student-driven, with Blane serving as moderator for student online chats. Blane conducts a once-weekly, 2-hour videoconferencing session which teaches \\"traditional davening and praying\\" followed by student-led discussions on subjects such as Jewish law, holidays, or festivals. Each student also prepares a weekly D’var Torah (talk on a topic in the weekly Torah portion). Rabbinical candidates are required to participate in online chats and submit \\"a 2,000-word research paper in a Jewish area of their choice\\". Students meet each other in person for the first time at their ordination. In line with his belief in Jewish Universalism and religious pluralism, Blane actively courts students from Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds. \\"I don't believe that Jewish people were uniquely chosen for a relationship with God - God doesn't choose a favorite child\\", he is quoted as saying. He believes that converts in particular are able to establish an affinity with the estimated 50% of Jews who are unaffiliated or intermarried. One-third of his rabbinical school students are converts. In 2012 Blane ordained Dario Hunter an openly gay man born to a Muslim father and African American mother who opposes financial support for Israel and was fired by the synagogue where he was rabbi, and a former Catholic from Brazil. As of November 2016, Blane has ordained a total of 112 rabbis, including 2 cantors. Graduates of the school are not recognized by the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly or the Reform Central Conference of American Rabbis; however, they do conduct their own weddings, funerals, and High Holy Day services. Sim Shalom Online Synagogue Blane is also the founder of Sim Shalom Synagogue, an interactive Universalist cyber-synagogue, which offers live weeknight and Sabbath synagogue services to an international community via computer hookup. The platform offers an interactive chat feature that allows participants from around the globe to converse in real time with the rabbi(s) and each other during services. The liturgy of the synagogue is fully participatory in that everything is viewable on the computer screen of the worshiper.The Radio Rabbi, 13th November 2011 The Synagogue's siddurim (prayerbooks) and prayers are transliterated into English. The Sim Shalom Synagogue is a USA not-for- profit 501(c)(3) corporation. Sim Shalom has assembled Jazz High Holiday service celebrations with a live congregation at iconic New York City venues for the past five years. UJUC Rabbi Blane is the founder of the new Jewish movement Jewish Universalism, launched in 2015 to foster Jewish worship and rituals without restrictions. It embraces the diversity of the Jewish world and all its Jewish denominations. The UJUC Union of Jewish Universalist Communities adheres and promotes the understanding to live one's faith guided by a love of Jewish tradition. Positions Blane supports the traditional brit milah (ritual circumcision) ceremony, but advocates the brit shalom, as an acceptable non-invasive naming ceremony for Jewish male infants. Blane is listed as the officiating rabbi at various types of wedding ceremonies, including interfaith weddings between Jews and Christians. Personal life Blane had previously lived in Haworth, New Jersey and lives with his wife and children in Manhattan. He plays piano and guitar.

He said it was clearly an act of terror. 17 April 2013 - 1:05 pm – A female victim admitted in the hospital said she fell down after hearing a massive explosion and seeing fire. \\"I don't remember anything after that,\\" she said. Meanwhile, officials said none of the vehicles that were present at that Bangalore blast site had a LPG kit.

If the blast near BJP's office in Banglore is a terror attack, it will certainly help the BJP politically on the eve of election. BJP leader Balbir Punj had said earlier that he hoped that it was not a terror attack. 17 April 2013 - 11:45 am – Commissioner of Police Raghavendra Auradkar said the explosion was caused by a motorcycle bomb.

Despite being known under the synonym Gouais noir in the Aisne, Aube, Marne, Meuse and Seine-et-Marne departments, the grape has no known connection to the Gouais blanc wine grape that is the parent of several wine grape varieties such as Chardonnay, Gamay and Melon de Bourgogne. While once widely planted throughout the Franche-Comté, the grape is now nearly extinct with less than 1 hectare (2.5 acres) of the variety planted in 2008.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 330-331, Allen Lane 2012 History The name Enfariné comes from the French word farine and refers to the dusting or \\"bloom\\" of indigenous yeast that covers the berries as they ripen. The name Enfariné comes from the French word farine meaning flour. It comes from the \\"bloom\\" or \\"blush\\" (now known to be indigenous yeast) that covers ripening grapes, looking like flour dusting. Some ampelographers, such as Pierre Galet, speculate that the grape originated in the Aube department in what is now part of the Champagne wine region. The first written record of Enfariné noir comes from a February 3, 1731 decree from the parliament of Besançon in the Doubs department of the Franche-Comté. This decree mandated that all plantings of several grape varieties, including Enfariné, Foirard noir, Foirard blanc, Maldoux, Valet noir and Barclan blanc, that were planted after 1702 had to be uprooted and replaced with cereal crops. According to an 1856 report, this parliamentary decree resulted in a decreasing of vineyard plantings by more than a third by 1732. The synonym Gouais noir has long been attached to Enfariné noir but ampelographers have determined that Enfariné noir is not a color mutation of Gouais blanc with no known connection between the two grapes. There is some speculation from ampelographers like Galet that the variety may have some connection to Gueuche noir of which it shares several synonyms. Viticulture Enfariné noir is a late ripening variety that can be very productive and high yielding if not kept in check by winter bud pruning, low vigor rootstock and perhaps even green harvesting. The vine tends to create large cluster thick-skin berries that tend to be larger than other Vitis vinifera varieties. There are very few viticultural hazards that Enfariné noir is susceptible to with the vine being resistant to most grapevine diseases. Wine regions The Franche-Comté region where Enfariné noir was once widely planted Enfariné noir was once widely planted throughout the Franche-Comté but over the last couple centuries its numbers have dramatically decreased and now the variety is nearly extinct. In 2008, less than 1 hectare (2.5 acre) of the vine was reported with the vast majority being found in the Jura wine region. Here producers such as Domaine Ganevat, Domaine des Cavarodes, Étienne Thiebaud and Domaine Jean Bourdy have worked to replant and sustain the variety in conservation vineyards. The results from these conservation vineyards often goes into vin de pays where it is often blended with Poulsard. Styles According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson Enfariné noir tends to produce wines with high acid levels that can be useful as a blending component, especially for light bodied reds meant to be consumed early, or in sparkling wine production. Synonyms Over the years Enfariné noir has been known under a variety of synonyms, including Bourgogne, Bregin bleu, Brezin de Pampan, Chagnot, Chaigneau, Chamoisien, Chineau, Encendre, Enfarine, Enfariné du Jura, Gaillard (in Burgundy and along the Saône valley), Gau, Goix noir, Got noir, Gouache, Gouai noir, Gouailler, Gouais, Gouais noir, Gouais violet, Gouape, Gouat gau, Gouet, Grisard, Grison (in the arrondissement of Dole), Hureau, Lombard, Lurio, Mureau, Neri blau, Nerre, Petit Goix, Saint Martin, Urio and Urion.Vitis International Variety Catalogue (VIVC) Enfariné noir Accessed: April 17th, 2013 References Category:Red wine grape varieties ","title":"Enfariné noir"},{"id":"39136651","text":"Sydney Seymour Hyde Stanhope, 6th Earl of Harrington (27 September 1845 – 22 February 1866) was an English peer.

Zeller's four decades left a lasting impact in the areas of Protestant Christianity, scholarship, and education. Early life Zeller was born in 1830 in Besigheim (near Stuttgart), with a family heritage of more than 300 years of filling different offices in the church. At the age of 24 he graduated from Basel Mission School, and did his year of practicum in England. Since he was planning to come to the Middle East he dedicated this year to learning English and Arabic. In 1855 he was ordained as a deacon in the Anglican Church, and was sent to the Holy Land by the Church Mission Society. He arrived there in 1857. Mission in Palestine After spending two years in Nablus, he was stationed in Nazareth, where he stayed for the next 20 years. In Nazareth he became a very well-known person, not only in the town itself, but also in all of the Galilee area. In 1858 he went back for a year to England, there he was ordained as an Anglican priest. When he returned, he married Hanna Maria Sophie, the daughter of Maria Gobat and Samuel Gobat, the second Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem. Zeller believed that education was the main method to get to the heart of the people and to increase the Protestant influence in Nazareth and the area. This was not easy, since there was great pressure on those people who sent their children to the Protestant school. However, Zeller persevered to establish and develop the school, believing that it would be the seed for the Anglican denomination. Furthermore, he did not stop in Nazareth, but opened classes in Reineh, Kafr Kanna and Jaffa of Nazareth (Yafa an- Naseriyye), and later on in Shefa-'Amr. In the early 1870s he rented a room in Acre and started classes there. He also assisted his Armenian colleague Kaloost Vartan of the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society in the founding of the Nazareth Hospital. Zeller’s activities contributed significantly to the establishment and the growth of the denomination, especially in Nazareth where the need to build a proper center became a pressing one. In July 1871, and after a long contest with the Ottoman governor, the building of the Christ Church, Nazareth was completed. At the dedication ceremony on 1 October 1871, three of his helpers were ordained: Seraphim Boutaji and Michael Ka’war. These were the first Arabs to be ordained in the Diocese of Jerusalem. Also ordained was Zeller’s colleague James Jacob Huber. After 20 years in Nazareth, Zeller was transferred to Jerusalem in 1876. By that time he was considered an expert in the fields of Arabic and Muslim evangelism. This became a very important issue for the Church Mission Society in the 1870s, when it was reorganized to concentrate on evangelizing among the Muslim community. Zeller was one of the main people who trained the missionaries. In Jerusalem he took charge of the Bishop's School and founded a Preparandi Institute which was devoted to training teachers. In 1901, he realized that it was time to retire, and in the same year he left Jerusalem to go back to Germany. He died of heart failure on the 19th of February, 1902. Legacy Zeller left behind him a long list of people (especially indigenous) whom he had trained and equipped properly for the ministry in the Middle East. He also made contribution to archaeological research during his long career in Palestine. During his ministry in Nazareth he helped to establish the Anglican school, the Protestant Church, and an orphanage for girls, thus making a great contribution to the city and the whole Galilee. The school and church in Nazareth still exist, and the orphanage is now St Margaret's Guest House.

It provides about 20 in-patient beds, a minor injuries department, a range of out-patient clinics and other support services. It opened in 1874. History The 2nd Marquess of Westminster, for whom the hospital is named In 1871, some two years after the death of Richard Grosvenor, 2nd Marquess of Westminster, his wife, Lady Elizabeth Leveson- Gower, and one daughter gave a plot of land for the construction of a hospital in her husband's memory. He had long connections with Shaftesbury, owning much property in the vicinity. The family lived in Motcombe for part of the year and the Marquess died in the new Fonthill Abbey, Fonthill Gifford, some 10 miles from Shaftesbury. The foundation stone was laid in May 1871 by Lady Theodora Grosvenor, and three years later the hospital was inaugurated by George Moberly, Bishop of Salisbury. The design of the building was by J B Corby of Stamford, Lincolnshire and the hospital was constructed by a Shaftesbury man, Mr C J Miles. The funding of the hospital's six beds in its early days was through subscribers (a guinea annually or a lifetime payment of £20). Patients were subject to a modest fee and there was a small income from an endowment fund provided by the Grosvenor family. No parish poor were admitted but instead were cared for in the local workhouse infirmary. In 1907 the first major addition to the hospital was a small operating theatre, funded by Lady Theodora in memory of her mother, deceased some 16 years previously. Local doctors had suggested the theatre and it was built as an extension on the west side of the hospital with a double lantern roof to admit full light. Further development followed with central heating installed in 1909 and an X-ray facility, after some delay, in 1919. To assist with the funding of the hospital the Shaftesbury Carnival Committee donated money from the annual carnival. In 1924 there was a meeting with representatives of the Salisbury Infirmary regarding affiliation. 1928 saw the inauguration of the Hospital League, an adjunct organisation to which subscribers paid to qualify for treatment at the hospital. In 1930 a major enlargement to the hospital was opened by Lord Evelyn Seymour and his wife Lady Edith Seymour, the Duchess of Somerset; this provided more bed space and accommodation for staff. The out- patients department was added in 1938 and in the same year there was an agreement to join the Salisbury Hospital Group. In 1948, Castle Hill House was purchased and converted into a small maternity unit which was managed by the Matron from the WMH and local doctors. It functioned until the early 1980s when it closed and was later sold. Management Originally the hospital was managed by a committee of local medical practitioners and worthies, with the day-to-day running managed by a matron. In 1938 the hospital became part of the Salisbury Hospital Group. In 1986 it became part of the Salisbury Community NHS Trust and remained so until 2001, when its management and development was taken over by what is now Dorset HealthCare University NHS Foundation Trust. In 2007 a review of the hospital was undertaken, with the aim of closing or redeveloping the facility. There was a full public consultation and the decision was to further develop the services available on-site. Recent fabric developments In the early 1980s, a further extension was added to the southeast corner of the hospital in the form of an octagon. This 10-bed ward was used for the assessment and rehabilitation of elderly people under the care of a specialist consultant from Salisbury Hospital. It has since closed and is used as a meeting room and base for community services. A purpose-designed extension was built on the north side of the hospital in 1988 to provide improved accommodation for the physiotherapy services. The hospital has a very active and successful League of Friends, formed in 1950, which raises money to fund projects that have a lower priority on the NHS budget. Present day services The Westminster Memorial Hospital at present (2013) provides: * Beds for Elderly Care Rehabilitation, GP Medical Admissions and direct admissions * A minor injury unit open during the day only * Day facilities * Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy * A radiology department * A wide range of out-patient clinics * Accommodation for some community services, including mental health, palliative care and community rehabilitation See also * Healthcare in Dorset * List of hospitals in England References External links *Official site Category:NHS hospitals in England Category:Hospitals in Dorset Category:Hospitals established in 1874 Category:Shaftesbury Category:1874 establishments in England ","title":"Westminster Memorial Hospital"},{"id":"39136754","text":"Axinoptera ruficosta is a moth in the family Geometridae.

They moved north to Lake Chrissie area from Wakkerstroom. After the defeat by Mzilikazi during the Mfecane they settled in the area now known as Sekhukhuneland in Limpopo Province. Their totem animal is the lion. Batau people include Batau Ba Masemola, Batau ba Manganeng, Batau ba Marishane, Phaahla, Kgaphola (Nkambule), Mogashoa (Mkhatshwa), Nchabeleng, Maroteng, Mohlaletsi, Malatane, Byldrift and Mmotwaneng. These communities share the same history. They were all united under one political head, Kgoshi Ngwato, back in the 14th and 15th century. At this time they lived along the Crocodile River in Mpumalanga. From there they migrated to the Transvaal, to the place currently called Pretoria. At this time they were under the political leadership of Matlebo. Eventually they migrated further north to Sekhukhune, where they were led by Matlebjane. According to record established by Mamagase Macheng Makgaleng and later considered by Chris Kanyane, King Matlebjane was the younger brother of Matlebo. So after Matlebo died, Matlebjane took power because Matlebo died without the heir to his Throne. Matlebjane ruled Batau for a long time. The case was accepted by the Batau people. Matlebjane had six sons: Mokwena, Seloane, Mogashoa (Who was the sister's son) Masemola, Phaahla and Photo, each by different wives. As Matlebjane grew old he preferred to spend his time with a young wife who was very beautiful. All the rewards and dibego were taken to the younger wife and all the kingly honours were enjoyed with the younger wife. Photo was the son of this younger wife. In time the other sons of Matlebjane, got worried that their father would give the kingship to Photo. So this became a sore affair. The issue was very unsettling also to the other wives. So out of this a bloody political plan was cooked. The three sons Seloane, Masemola, Phaahla including Mogashoa colluded and planned that Matlebjane their father and King of Batau must die. They wanted to kill him. But the question was how and how were they going to manage the political fall- out after the murder had happened. They knew there was going to be an uprising in the community and they will be killed. So the proposed a plan that Photo must be the one to kill Matlebjane. Because Photo was still young teenager - his brothers found it easy to influence him badly and bring him into their bloody scheme of murdering Matlebjane. According to their plan they will visit Matlebjane in his sleep with spears to all kill him. But that was only half of the plan, the part that was communicated to Photo. The full plan was that all the sons excluding Photo will have their spears bent at the tip end. So as they entered the King's resting place at night and they signaled that all stab the King in his sleep it was Photo's spear that pierced through and killed the King. The other did not kill the Kings as their spears were bent at the tip end. Nevertheless, the community suspected and finally discovered the whole full story. So the community of Batau was divided through each of the sons. And the Batau scattered. And now you have Batau ba Masemola separated from others under their own political leadership, you have Phaahla alone, Mogashoa alone, Kgaphola alone, Seloane alone and Photo covering the whole area of Tubatse further north. Other Batau travelled furth north and are now found in various communities across the vast Limpopo Province.  References  Mamagase Macheng Makgaleng (1956): Batau ba Tsitlana, Van Schaik.

Career  La Poix de Fréminville was born to a family of naval engineers, and joined the Navy in 1801. He served as an aid to Rear- Admiral Latouche-Tréville and distinguished himself on the gunboat Etna during Nelson's Raids on Boulogne. At the age of 15,Review of E.

In 1806, he was appointed to the frigate Sirène on which he took part in a naval division under Captain Amand Leduc, also comprising the frigates Guerrière and Revanche,Choix de voyages, p.5 and sent near the North Pole to prey on British whalers. During the campaign, he served as signals major, adjudant to the division, and hydrographer.Levot, p.196 He notably rediscovered the island of Enckuysen, which Bellin had placed at 65°N 12°W in maps in 1751 and 1767 and whose existence had been doubted, but which were spotted at 65°54'N 12°48'W.Voyage to the North Pole, p.80The island was suppressed from maps in 1854. (Levot, p. 196). The frigates sailed up to Spitsbergen, capturing a number of prizes, and returned to Iceland, where Fréminville measured several point of the coast. The squadron then cruised off Ireland and returned to France in September 1807, except Guerrière, captured by HMS Blanche on 19 July 1806. Seeing little action in the seven following years, Fréminville achieved the rank of Lieutenant only in 1811. A royalist at heart, he welcomed the Bourbon Restoration, but his career did not accelerate; he served on the fluyt Rhône in the Baltic Sea and the frigate Néréide off Western Africa. In mid-1822, Néréide was in the Caribbean, and Fréminville fell in love with a Creole girl named \\"Caroline C.\\" at the Îles des Saintes; Néréide was sent to Martinique and then to Guadeloupe meanwhile sailed along the coast of Saintes without stopping with Fréminville aboard. Caroline was misled, thinking that her lover was heading to Europe and would never return, and she committed suicide. In 1824, Fréminville took command of the fluyt Bonite.Fonds Marine, p.593 The year after, he commanded the fluyt AdourFonds Marine, p.595 in America. Constantly performing archeology and natural history surveys, he requested in vain command of an exploration mission. It was not until 1827 that he was promoted to Commander. In 1829, Fréminville was appointed to evaluate a chip log invented by Pierre Bouguer, which he deemed unsuitable. Fréminville retired from the Navy in 1831. The same year, he pseudonymously authored an \\"Essay on the physical and moral influence of the female costume\\",\\"Essai sur l'influence physique et morale du costume féminin \\". in which he stated that female clothes The pseudonym \\"Caroline de L.\\" that Fréminville used was later interpreted as a hommage to the Creole of the Saintes.

Known for being Queensland's first missionary or one of the first, Handt is also said to have brought in the first pineapples in Queensland. Early life Handt was born Johann Christian Simon Hundt in 1794. One source lists his birthplace as Aken-on-the-Elbe, Saxony, Germany, others list Prussia. His mother died in 1813 and his father in 1816. He changed his surname to \\"Handt\\" after being constantly laughed at for his surname sounding like \\"Hund\\" (German for \\"dog\\"). Handt went on to become a tailor before enrolling as a missionary; in 1822, Handt moved to Switzerland to attend the Basle Missionary Institute in Basel. He graduated in January 1827. Career and personal life In around 1830, the London Missionary Society dispatched Handt to work with natives in Australia, alongside a few other Germans. Handt reached Sydney on 25 June 1831. That year, he travelled with his wife to Wellington, New South Wales, to start missionary work for the New South Wales Church Mission Society. Their work came to an end when one of them came down with an illness and the couple were forced to return to Sydney. He is credited as the first German missionary in New South Wales, and one of the first missionaries in Queensland. Handt is credited with having brought in the first pineapples in Queensland. Handt married Mary Crook (died 1844), the eldest daughter of educator and missionary William Pascoe Cook, in July 1832. They had three children — Sarah, Wilhelm, and Ambrosius. Handt was a Lutheran. Final years and death One source states that Handt died at a prison hospital in Geelong, Victoria, on 7 July 1863, aged 70. Another source writes that he died at his residence in Bond Street, Chillwell. It is unclear as to where Handt is buried.

In addition, prior to the 1949–50 season, the archaic field-goal was also still a valid means of scoring points. Club records Ted Bateson extended the 'most tries in a season' record for Wakefield Trinity with 26-tries scored in the 1928–29 season, and 27-tries scored in the 1929–30 season, this record was extended by Freddie Smart to 29-tries in the 1931–32 season.

Part of a series of disturbances across the country, it took place at the same time as the better-known Prayer Book Rebellion or Western Rising and for many of the same reasons: discontent at the introduction in June 1549 of the Book of Common Prayer, fuelled by economic distress and resentment at enclosures of common land.Caraman, P. The Western Rising, 1549, Westcountry, 1994, p. 80 Kett's Rebellion, which centred on enclosures, took place in the same month, contributing to a growing sense of national disorder in what was popularly known afterwards as \\"the commotion time\\". The rising The church of Barford St. Michael. Its vicar, James Webbe, was one of the leaders of the 1549 rising, and was subsequently executed at Aylesbury. Based mainly on the fact that, unlike other rebels, he was later tried in London, it is probable that James Webbe, the vicar of Barford St Michael, was the captain of the Rising. Other ringleaders were a wealthy farmer, Thomas Bouldry or Bowldry of Great Haseley, and Henry Joyes, vicar of Chipping Norton.A. Vere Woodman, \\"The Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Rising of 1549\\", Oxoniensia, XXII, 82-83 Unlike the rising in Devon and Cornwall, it does not seem that any gentry became involved, and most of those whose names were to be associated with the Rising were either farmers, artisans, or parish priests. The Rising's quick suppression meant that the rebels' specific demands have gone unrecorded, though they were probably similar to those of the Cornish rising – reinstatement of the Six Articles and the Latin liturgy – with additional local grievances. Joyes, at Chipping Norton, appears to have joined the Rising because the effects of the chantries act had left him to minister alone to 800 parishioners.Beer, B. L. Rebellion and Riot, Kent State UP, p. 150 It is probable that local resentment at enclosures also played a part, particularly at Great Haseley, where Thomas Bouldry had been lessee of the demesne farm, and where the recently enclosed deer park of Sir John Williams at Rycote House was attacked by a mob who subsequently broke into his house and drank his wine and beer.Victoria County History Oxfordshire: Great Haseley, \\"Social History\\", (Dec 2012) p. 5 There had been some minor enclosure riots or disturbances in Buckinghamshire the previous year, though the authorities' response was lenient. The first clear evidence of an official response to the Rising is a letter from Somerset, the Protector, dated 10 July, in which he refers to persons \\"nuely assembled\\" in Buckinghamshire.Woodman, 79 On the 12th he described to Lord Russell - awaiting reinforcements to suppress the rising in the South-West - a \\"stirr here in Bucks. and Oxfordshire by instigacion of sundery priests\\", adding \\"kepe it to yr. selfe\\".Woodman, 79 The Rising gained momentum and after a brief delay, forces were dispatched in mid July under the formidable soldier William Grey, 13th Baron Grey de Wilton.Wood,The 1549 Rebellions and the Making of Early Modern England, Cambridge University Press, p. 51 Accompanying him were 1500 mainly German and Swiss mercenary soldiers, en route to suppressing the West Country disturbances.McCoog (ed), The Reckoned Expense: Edmund Campion and the Early English Jesuits, Boydell & Brewer p. 43 The place at which Grey's force confronted the rebels is often thought to have been Enslow Hill in Oxfordshire, although an encampment near Chipping Norton has also been suggested. King Edward noted the outcome in his journal for 18 July: > To Oxfordshire the Lord Grey of Wilton was sent with 1500 horsemen and > footmen; whose coming with th'assembling of the gentlemen of the countrie, > did so abash the rebels, that more than hauf of them rann ther wayes, and > other that tarried were some slain, some taken and some hanged.Woodman, 80 In the immediate aftermath of the troops' arrival, there were signs that the Privy Council was beginning to regret employing German landsknechts in Oxfordshire, as it was reported that people were threatening to leave not one foreigner alive in England.Cornwall, J. Revolt of the Peasantry 1549, Routledge, 1977, p. 130 Aftermath Although sympathetic with many anti- enclosure protestors, Edward Seymour, the Lord Protector, ordered the suppression of the rising in Oxfordshire. His response to the rebellions of 1549 was instrumental in his downfall later that year. The orders given on 19 July by Lord Grey to his lieutenants make it clear there were a large number of summary executions immediately following the confrontation at Enslow Hill, but of the 200 or so taken captive around a dozen ringleaders, a mixture of priests and yeomen, were ordered to be executed for treason in various towns. The executions were to be carried out on the towns' respective market days and the victims' heads were to be set in the highest available spot \\"for the more terror of the said evil people\\".Woodman, 80 James Webbe was hanged, drawn and quartered at Aylesbury on 22 August, and death sentences were carried out on Joyes, who was hanged in chains from his own church tower, Bouldry, and their associates. However, not all those appointed to die were executed, including John Wade, the vicar of Bloxham, who had also been ordered to be hanged from his own steeple: he was spared and was still living at Bloxham in 1553. A number of the Buckinghamshire men were also spared, with the pardons issued to Thomas Kyghtley, George and Thomas Willatt, John Warde and Edward Barton being the only information remaining on the Buckinghamshire insurgents.Woodman, 84 Despite the pardons extended to some ringleaders, the Rising in general seems to have been put down with the same pitiless force and brutality that characterised the response to the Prayer Book Rebellion, where large-scale massacres were alleged. Lord Grey needed little encouragement to act with severity and it is clear that many more executions took place than the dozen specified in his order of 19 July .Woodman, 80 Writing some years later under the pro-Catholic regime of Queen Mary, the poet William Forrest, who had been a monk at Thame (where at least two executions were carried out) around the time of the Rising, described a time in which: > :Downe went the Crosse in every countraye, :Goddys servauntes used withe > muche crudelytee, :Dysmembred (like beastes) in th'open highe waye, :Their > inwardys pluckte oute and hartis wheare they layeForrest, Grysilde the > Seconde, quoted in Woodman, 82 The countrywide disturbances of 1549 were to play a part in the downfall of Somerset later that year, as he was blamed by other Privy Council members for the discontent and criticised for his response, which varied wildly between the liberally tolerant and the draconian. Somerset appears to have had a good deal of sympathy with protestors against enclosure, if not with the religiously-inspired rebels, and many of those who threw down enclosures had been misled by his earlier pronouncements into believing that they were acting with the King's blessing.Wood, A. The 1549 Rebellions and the Making of Early Modern England, CUP, pp. 49–51 Somerset remained a figure of hate for religious conservatives, and his final removal from power in January 1550 was greeted with joyous demonstrations in Oxford.McCoog, p. 44 Historiography and influence The Rising was poorly recorded, especially in Buckinghamshire, and was subsequently almost forgotten, even in official records. Nevertheless, it seems to have been well remembered in its local area. Half a century later, folk memories of its suppression served as a partial inspiration of a later attempt, the Oxfordshire Rising of 1596: its leader Bartholomew Steer arranged for the rebels to meet on Enslow Hill, where he said \\"the [1549] risers were persuaded to go home, and were then hanged like dogs\\".Calendar of State Papers, Reign of Elizabeth: 1594-1597, v4, HMSO 1869, p. 343 Though the Rising took place many years before Steer's lifetime he might have learned of it when he worked at Rycote, and he was born in Hampton Poyle, whose incumbent priest was hanged after the events of 1549.Walter, J.Crowds and Popular Politics in Early Modern England, CUP, p. 111 Later academic interpretations of the Rising have varied. A. Vere Woodman, writing the first detailed study of the sources in 1957, argued that there was little apparent link with anti-enclosure protests that had taken place in 1548 and that the rebellion was largely a result of conservatism in the matter of the liturgy, along with the threatened confiscation of church goods and the suppression of chantries.Woodman, 78-79 Some later commentators, such as Beer (2005), have sought to stress the rebellion's anti-enclosure aspect.Beer, pp. 150–151 References Category:1549 in England Category:Tudor rebellions Category:History of Buckinghamshire Category:History of Oxfordshire Category:Conflicts in 1549 Category:16th century in Buckinghamshire Category:16th century in Oxfordshire ","title":"Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire rising of 1549"},{"id":"39137026","text":"A Nokia 5800 showing its modes, including silent mode Silent mode is a setting available on mobile phones and pagers that, when activated, disables the ringtones and, in some cases, also the vibrating alerts or alarm.

He is most widely known for his 2012 book Chicago Whispers: A History of LGBT Chicago Before Stonewall. His works have explored the underground cultures and aspects of Chicago's LGBT community dating back to the 1670s. He has had several columns in Chicago publications, both in print and online: Outlines (now Windy City Times), Nightspots, Chicago Now, and Chicago Free Press. De la Croix was approached by Chicago's municipal tourism authority to script and conduct the first \\"LGBT History of Chicago\\" bus tour. He had two plays, A White Light in God's Choir (2005), and Two Weeks in a Bus Shelter with an Iguana (2006), performed by Chicago's Irreverence Dance & Theatre company. In 2008, he participated as a historian in a PBS television documentary, Out and Proud in Chicago. He has spoken for organizations such as Boeing, Chubb Insurance, and Horizons Gay Youth Services. In 2011, de la Croix was honored with an Esteem Award for Outstanding Magazine Reporter or Columnist. In November 2012, he was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame.  Childhood  St. Sukie de la Croix was born in Bath, Somerset, as Darryl Michael Vincent, to a poor family. His father Stanley Reginald was a truck driver while his gypsy mother Doreen Mary worked in an engineering factory. He was an only child and grew up an hour away from Stonehenge in a community populated by many pagans and gypsies. Due to his community and socialist parents, De la Croix was not raised to follow a specific religion. When asked what he considers to be his religion his response is that he's pagan. However, he makes a note to point out that he doesn't care to abide by a label as most Americans tend to. De la Croix attended Westhill Boys School until the age of 16. During his time in school he felt odd and out of place. He was able to find comfort in books later realizing he didn't want to fit in. He lived in a \\"vacuum of [his] own making\\". Unable to advance to university, he began to work.  Family relationships In 1971, de la Croix married Frances, his wife of 12 years. He was open to his wife and other about his bisexuality before and during the marriage. They had two children together, Lucy Anna Marie and Daniel Jon. He also has four grandchildren from his daughter. In 1981, he left Frances for Diesel Balaam. The two men wrote a satirical column together for the Emerald City News which was also published weekly in London's Capital Gay from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. They were together for six years. De la Croix then met Ian Henzel, to whom he is still married.  Early and British Career  In the 1960s, de la Croix became a member of the liberal counterculture of the time, focusing on political, socialist, and anarchist matters. In 1967, he started writing articles for underground and alternative press. In the early 1980s de la Croix switched his attention and began writing for a number of Britain's LGBT publications: Gay Times, Vada, Capital Gay, and the Pink Paper.  Chicago  After arriving in Chicago in 1991 de la Croix took an interest in telling the stories of those who had lived before in the area. He began writing a column entitled \\"A Letter from America\\" for the Pink Paper, which he describes as \\"a wry, humorous look at gay life in a large American city.\\" It was the summer of 1997 when de la Croix says he started listening to the \\"Chicago Whispers.\\" He had begun working for Tracy Baim as the associate editor for a gay paper Outlines (now known as Windy City Times), and was the managing editor of Nightspots: For both papers he would report on various aspects of Chicago's gay community. Unable to find a reference which would settle a disagreement about the location of a former nightclub, he resolved to produce one himself. This led to him writing a weekly column for the Windy City Times entitled \\"Chicago Whispers.\\" After six years, de la Croix did a ten-week spin-off series for the Chicago Tribune. During this time he wrote the script for – and reluctantly conducted – a bus tour of historical LGBT Chicago. De la Croix approached writing Chicago Whispers from a non-academic perspective, and as an outsider documenting a city foreign to him as an Englishman. Instead he approached it as journalist. The book starts in the 1670s with the Native Americans and early settlers, and ends at the beginning of the Stonewall Riots in 1969. It covers art, theatre, mafia connections, bar life, and politics.  Name  After going to see a gypsy/fortune teller—whose prediction eventually came true—de la Croix decided to officially change his name from Darryl Michael Vincent to Sukie de la Croix in honor of the fortune teller. He added the St. years later in opposition to the fact that only the Church could deem someone a Saint. He considers himself 'the patron saint of homosexuals'.

History and description The church hall, now used as Petersham's village hall Designed by Leeds architect John Kelly, the church was commissioned in 1899 by Rachel Laetitia Warde (née Walker) (1841–1906) to accommodate the expected suburban expansion of Petersham and as a memorial to her parents, using funds from the estate of her father Samuel Walker (1812–1898) who had died the previous year. However, she died three years before it was finished and the project was completed by her son Lionel (1876–1963). The church, with a separate church hall and institute (which is also Grade II listed) was erected in the grounds of Bute House (previously the residence of British Prime Minister John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, and which was demolished in 1908). It was built in red brick and terracotta in the style of a basilica. The campanile (bell tower) is 118 feet high and overlooks Richmond Park. Bridget Cherry and Nikolaus Pevsner described the architectural style as \\"[e]mphatically Italian Early Christian or Romanesque\\", the interior as \\"lavish\\" and the baptistery as \\"quite exceptional\\". The nave had a grey and white marble central aisle taken from Tournai Cathedral in Belgium. The church was never consecrated as the anticipated growth in Petersham's population did not take place. However, it was used occasionally by the parish and also by the Greek Orthodox Church. It continued to be used for weddings until 1981 but ceased to be used as a church in 1986. During the Second World War it was requisitioned and used as a radar and anti-aircraft command post. It was also used as a recording studio and as a location for filming. In January 1976 Luciano Pavarotti recorded his best-selling O Holy Night album (reissued as a CD in 1990) in the church. Other recordings made at the church include an album of songs by Alexander Borodin and Alexander Dargomizhsky, performed by Sergei Leiferkus, Semion Skigin and Leonid Gorokhov, and recordings by John McCabe and by Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music. Other artists who have recorded there include Vladimir Ashkenazy, Dimitri Ashkenazy, and Vovka Ashkenazy. The Anglican Diocese of Southwark sold the church building in about 1996. It is now a private residence, known as All Saints House, and has been converted to include an indoor swimming pool, jacuzzi and steam room. The church hall is now used as Petersham's village hall. The frieze above the hall's front entrance has the inscription \\"AD 1900. Ellen Walker Thy Kingdom Come. Memorial Church Room\\". References Further reading * 74 pages.  44 pages.

It is the sixth mosque to be built in Taiwan. History Before the establishment of the mosque, Muslims around Tainan had to travel to Kaohsiung for any mosque- related activities at Kaohsiung Mosque. A land was donated by Wang Huihuan, a local Muslim living in the United States. Initially the land title was given to Taipei Grand Mosque, but then it was transferred to Kaohsiung Mosque which managed the construction of Tainan Mosque. At the end of 1983, the fund raising of the mosque began, led by Bai Yuqi of the Kaohsiung Mosque board of chairman. Funds were raised as a specific mission listed in the construction budget book of the Tainan Mosque. As a result, Tainan Mosque was subordinated to Kaohsiung Mosque as a branch, and the imam of Tainan Mosque is often the vice imam of Kaohsiung Mosque. The fund raising lasted for over 10 years and the construction of the mosque building finally commenced in 1993. The construction was completed in September 1996. Architecture Tainan mosque was designed by Yan Mingguang, a National Cheng Kung University graduate from Jordan. The mosque looks like an ordinary apartment building, completely unlike a traditional mosque. The building consists of four floors, in which they are dedicated for a shop, meeting room, ablution rooms for men and women, prayer hall and office.

Directed by Conor Allyn, the film stars Kellan Lutz, Mickey Rourke, Ario Bayu and Atiqah Hasiholan. Plot A suicide bomber detonates himself at a party in Java, Indonesia, and a Javanese Sultan's daughter, Sultana (Atiqah Hasiholan), is believed to be one of the unidentified victims. Jake Travers (Kellan Lutz), an American posing as a graduate student from Cornell University, was at the scene of the blast and is held as a witness by a police detective of Detachment 88, Lieutenant Hashim (Ario Bayu). After interviewing Jake at the crime scene, Hashim and Jake are attacked by terrorists led by Malik (Mickey Rourke) and his henchman Achmed. Jake saves Hashim and kills two terrorists, but Achmed manages to escape. Hashim becomes suspicious after he observes Jake's combat skills. Jake and Hashim are brought to the hospital where Hashim's wife meets Jake. At Hashim's wife's insistence, Hashim invites Jake to their house for breakfast. At the house, Hashim tells Jake that he ran a background check on him through Interpol. Jake tells Hashim he is an FBI agent conducting an undercover investigation, and suggests they cooperate with one another. Returning to his apartment, Jake faxes to a friend stateside a photo of a tattoo from the corpse believed to be Sultana's. Jake's friend informs him that the tattoo is typically used by Chinese high-class prostitutes, which confirms Jake's suspicion that the body is not Sultana's. Jake follows a lead to a night club, where he brings home a prostitute bearing a similar tattoo. When the prostitute cooperates with Jake, they are ambushed by Hashim's terrorists and a Chinese gang operating the prostitution ring. The police, who had been covertly surveilling Jake, intervene and suffer casualties in the fight. Jake flees the scene, but the police eventually capture him. Hashim arrives home and discovers his family is kidnapped. Malik calls Hashim on a cell phone left at the house and taunts him. Hashim visits the police station, where he observes two U.S. Marines officers talking to his superior. Hashim confronts Jake again about his identity. Jake admits he is not FBI, but a Marine who is tracking terrorist activities because his comrades were killed by bombs from Malik's terrorist group. Jake then suggests that Hashim cooperate with him to find his family. Jake later confesses to Hashim that the terrorists also killed his brother. Suspecting that Sultana was actually kidnapped rather than killed, Jake and Hashim meet the Sultan, who oddly avoids discussing the matter in front of his vizier. The Sultan then slips Hashim a secret message requesting a private meeting. Later the Sultan meets Hashim and confides to him that Sultana was kidnapped and his throne is the ransom. The Sultan suspects his vizier is behind the plot. The vizier, however, learns about the meeting and a shoot-out ensues. Hashim and Jake manage to escape, but the Sultan is fatally wounded. Hashim and Jake intercept the vizier and his men at a bank as they are carting off the Sultan's royal jewelry. Hashim and Jake hide in a spa when Malik calls Hashim and threatens them. Hashim discovers Malik had intercepted his phone to reveal their location. Malik, who is outside, attacks Hashim and Jake with an RPG. In the ensuing chaos, Jake manages to save a royal jewel. As it turns out, Hashim's family is held captive in a van, and Malik and Achmed argue whether or not to set them free. In rage, Malik stabs Achmed. Disguised as paramedics, Jake and Hashim flee the site in an ambulance with a wounded Achmed inside. Before he dies, Achmed reveals where Hashim's family is being held captive. Jake and Hashim chase Malik through a Vesak ceremony at Borobudur temple. They rescue Sultana and Hashim's family from Malik, and subsequently kill him. Jake secretly switches the jewel held by Malik with the one in his possession. Jake is at the airport where he returns the jewelry to Sultana, as Hashim watches.

The film is banned in Australia and Germany.  Plot  Unable to bring in any more money for Leroy, her abusive pimp, the pregnant Rose tries to run away in the middle of the night, but is caught by Leroy. Using a clothes hanger, Leroy performs an impromptu abortion on Rose, unintentionally killing her in the process. Leroy disposes of Rose's baby in a dumpster, where its cries attract the attention of a homeless man, who raises the disfigured child as \\"Hanger\\". On his eighteenth birthday, the vagrant sends Hanger off to live with John, his biological father, who the man had earlier met at a junkyard. John informs Hanger that he has gotten him a job at the junkyard, and that he will be working there and living with Russell, an acquaintance with Down syndrome. As he drives away with Hanger, John runs over the homeless man (who was defecating in his tent) and joyously tells his long- lost son \\"Welcome to the rest of your life!\\" John gives Hanger a picture of Rose, and picks up a prostitute for him to have sex with, but upon seeing Hanger's mutilated face, the woman goes into hysterics, so John crushes her head in his truck door. While Hanger is watching pornography with Russell in their home, a Jehovah's Witness visits, and Hanger mauls and partially eats her while being cheered on by Russell. Later, John drops by, and reveals to Hanger that he has a plan to get revenge on Leroy for what he did to Rose. On his way out, John is approached by Foxy White, Leroy's girlfriend, who offers to help John kill Leroy. John turns down Foxy's offer, but says he will make Leroy suffer \\"a little extra\\" if Foxy watches over Hanger. While Hanger is at work, John is captured by Leroy and a prostitute named Trashy, who disfigure him with a blow torch, and a hanger. Foxy finds John and tries to release him, but Leroy walks in on this, and shoots Foxy in the head. As that occurs, Russell and Hanger are drugged by Phil, a co-worker, who rapes them while wearing a Santa suit; at one point, Phil inserts his penis into Hanger's leaking colostomy. Russell and Hanger get their revenge on Phil at the junkyard, knocking him out, and placing him under a pile of garbage. Russell goes home and drinks tea made from used tampons, but after getting a call from Hanger, Russell goes to the junkyard, and finds Nicole (the owner's daughter) unconscious in her office, Hanger having knocked her out with Phil's drugs. Russell takes Nicole's tampon, and she is later found by Leroy, who rapes her while she is unconscious, and threatens her into luring away Russell so Leroy can be alone with Hanger. Once he is in Nicole's office, Russell is seemingly killed by Leroy, who chokes him with one of Nicole's tampons. Outside, Hanger stomps Phil's head in, and is confronted by Leroy, but John (who was left for dead, but recovered and killed Trashy by shoving a douche up her nose) appears and calls Leroy out. Leroy and John fatally shoot each other, and a distraught Hanger runs off with the hysterical Nicole.  Cast  Release Hanger was released Direct-to-Video by Breaking Glass Pictures on Nov 17, 2009.  Reception  Film Bizarro found Hanger to be \\"a great entertaining trash-fest that has come the closest to being a true throwback to grindhouse cinema that any movie has so far\\" despite the ending feeling erratic and anticlimactic. A three and a half was awarded by Severed Cinema, which wrote that \\"Hanger is as entertaining as it is repulsive\\" and \\"the film is a fun campy horror comedy\\". Independent Flicks commended the camerawork, editing, gore, and Dan Ellis's performance, but gave a four and half out of seven after deeming the film \\"a bit too bizarre\\" and \\"something of a let down\\" due to the \\"cartoonish style\\" that lessened its impact. A three out of five was awarded by Digital Retribution, which stated \\"Hanger is hard to rate because it sets out to offend and will probably do so for virtually everyone, but that doesn't make it good\\" and \\"I found Hanger's padding and surrealism distracting and a bit boring\\". The film was called \\"Nicholson's nastiest piece of work yet\\" by The Worldwide Celluloid Massacre, which deemed it \\"worthless\\" and one of the most \\"vile\\" films the website has covered.

When conceptualized, its stated purpose was \\"to provide SpaceX an exclusive launch site that would allow the company to accommodate its launch manifest and meet tight launch windows.\\" The launch site was originally intended to support launches of the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles as well as \\"a variety of reusable suborbital launch vehicles\\", but in 2018, SpaceX announced a change of plans, stating that the launch site would be used exclusively for SpaceX's next-generation launch vehicle, Starship. In 2019 and 2020, the site added significant rocket production and test capacity. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk indicated in 2014 that he expected \\"commercial astronauts, private astronauts, to be departing from South Texas,\\" and he foresaw launching spacecraft to Mars from there. Between 2012 and 2014, SpaceX considered seven potential locations around the United States for the new commercial launch facility. Generally, for orbital launches an ideal site would have an easterly water overflight path for safety and be located as far south as possible in order to take advantage of the Earth's rotational speed. For much of this period, a parcel of land adjacent to Boca Chica Beach near Brownsville, Texas, was the leading candidate location, during an extended period while the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted an extensive environmental assessment on the use of the Texas location as a launch site. Also during this period, SpaceX began acquiring land in the area, purchasing approximately and leasing by July 2014. SpaceX announced in August 2014, that they had selected the location near Brownsville as the location for the new non-governmental launch site, after the final environmental assessment completed and environmental agreements were in place by July 2014. When the maiden launch of the Starship takes place, it will become SpaceX's fourth active launch facility, following three launch locations that are leased from the US government. SpaceX conducted a groundbreaking ceremony on the new launch facility in September 2014, and soil preparation began in October 2015. The first tracking antenna was installed in August 2016, and the first propellant tank arrived in July 2018. In late 2018, construction ramped up considerably, and the site saw the fabrication of the first prototype test vehicle, Starhopper, which was tested and flown March–August 2019. Through 2019 and 2020, additional prototype flight vehicles are being built at the facility for higher-altitude tests in 2020. By March 2020, there were over 500 people employed at the facility, with most of the work force involved in 24/7 production operations for the second-generation SpaceX launch vehicle, Starship. History Private discussions between SpaceX and various state officials about a future private launch site began at least as early as 2011, and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk mentioned interest in a private launch site for their commercial launches in a speech in September 2011. The company publicly announced in August 2014, that they had decided on Texas as the location for their new non-governmental launch site. Site soil work began in 2015 but major construction of facilities began only in late 2018, with rocket engine testing with flight testing beginning in 2019.  Launch site selection and environmental assessment  As early as April 2012, at least five potential locations were publicly known, including \\"sites in Alaska, California, Florida, Texas and Virginia.\\" In September 2012, it became clear that Georgia and Puerto Rico were also interested in pursuing the new SpaceX commercial spaceport facility. The Camden County, Georgia, Joint Development Authority voted unanimously in November 2012 to \\"explore developing an aero-spaceport facility\\" at an Atlantic coastal site to support both horizontal and vertical launch operations. The main Puerto Rico site under consideration at the time was land that had formerly been the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. By September 2012, SpaceX was considering a total of seven potential locations for the new commercial launch pad around the United States. For much of the time since, the leading candidate location for the new facility was a parcel of land adjacent to Boca Chica Beach near Brownsville, Texas. By early 2013, Texas remained the leading candidate for the location of the new SpaceX commercial launch facility, although Florida, Georgia and other locations also remained in the running. Legislation was introduced in the Texas Legislature to enable temporary closings of State beaches during launches, limit liability for noise and some other specific commercial spaceflight risks, as well as considering a package of incentives to encourage SpaceX to locate at the Brownsville, Texas location. 2013 economic estimates showed SpaceX investing approximately in the development and construction of the facility A incentive package was approved by the Texas Legislature in 2013. From the beginning, one of the proposed locations for the new commercial-mission-only spaceport had been south Texas. In April 2012, the FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation initiated a Notice of Intent to conduct an Environmental Impact Statement and public hearings on the new launch site, which would be located in Cameron County, Texas. The summary then indicated that the Texas site would support up to 12 commercial launches per year, including two Falcon Heavy launches. The first public meeting was held in May 2012, and the FAA released a draft Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the location in south Texas in April 2013. Public hearings on the draft EIS occurred in Brownsville, followed by a public comment period ending in June 2013. The draft EIS identified three parcels of land—total of —that would notionally be used for the control center. In addition, SpaceX had leased of land adjacent to the terminus of Texas State Highway 4, of which would be used to develop the vertical launch area; the remainder would remain open space surrounding the launch facility. In July 2014, the FAA officially issued its Record of Decision concerning the Boca Chica Beach facility, and found that \\"the proposal by Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies would have no significant impact on the environment,\\" approving the proposal and outlining SpaceX's proposal. The company formally announced selection of the Texas location in August 2014. In September 2013, the State of Texas General Land Office (GLO) and Cameron County signed an agreement outlining how beach closures would be handled in order to support a future SpaceX launch schedule. The agreement is intended to enable both economic development in Cameron County and protect the public's right to have access to Texas state beaches. Under the 2013 Texas plan, beach closures would be allowed but were not expected to exceed a maximum of 15 hours per closure date, with no more than three scheduled space flights between the Saturday prior to Memorial Day and Labor Day, unless the Texas GLO approves. In 2019, the FAA completed a reevaluation of the SpaceX facilities in South Texas, and in particular the revised plans away from a commercial spaceport to more of a spaceship yard for building and testing rockets at the facility, as well as flying different rockets—SpaceX Starship and prototype test vehicles—from the site than the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy envisioned in the original 2014 environmental assessment. In May and August 2019, the FAA issued a written report with a decision that a new supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) would not be required.  Land acquisition  Prior to a final decision on the location of the spaceport, SpaceX began purchasing a number of real estate properties in Cameron County, Texas beginning in June 2012. By July 2014, SpaceX had purchased approximately and leased near Boca Chica Village and Boca Chica Beach through a company named Dogleg Park LLC, a reference to the \\"dogleg\\" type of trajectory that rockets launched from Boca Chica will be required to follow. Prior to May 2013, five lots in the Spanish Dagger Subdivision in Boca Chica Village, adjacent to Highway 4 which leads to the proposed launch site, had been purchased. In May 2013, SpaceX purchased an additional three parcels, adding another , plus four more lots with a total of in July 2013, making a total of 12 SpaceX-purchased lots. In November 2013, SpaceX substantially \\"increased its land holdings in the Boca Chica Beach area from 12 lots to 72 undeveloped lots\\" purchased, which encompass a total of approximately , in addition to the leased from private property owners. An additional few acres were purchased late in 2013, raising the SpaceX total \\"from 72 undeveloped lots to 80 lots totaling about 26 acres.\\" In late 2013, SpaceX completed a replat of 13 lots totaling into a subdivision that they have named \\"Mars Crossing.\\" In February 2014, they purchased 28 additional lots that surround the proposed complex at Boca Chica Beach, raising the SpaceX-owned land to approximately in addition to the lease. SpaceX's investments in Cameron County continued in March 2014, with the purchase of more tracts of land, bringing the total number of lots it now owns to 90. Public records showed that the total land area that SpaceX then owned through Dogleg Park LLC was roughly . This is in addition to that SpaceX then had under lease. By September 2014, Dogleg Park completed a replat of lots totaling into a second subdivision, this one named \\"Launch Site Texas\\", made up of several parcels of property previously purchased. This is the site of the launch site itself while the launch control facility is planned two miles west in the Mars Crossing subdivision. Dogleg Park has also continued purchasing land in Boca Chica, and now owns a total of \\"87 lots equaling more than 100 acres\\". SpaceX has also bought and is modifying several residential properties in Boca Chica Village, but apparently planning to leave them in residential use, about west of the launch site. In September 2019, SpaceX extended an offer to buy each of the houses in Boca Chica Village for three times the fair market value along with an offer of VIP invitations to future launch events. The 3x offer was said to be \\"non-negotiable.\\" Homeowners were given two weeks for this particular offer to remain valid.  Construction  Major site construction at SpaceX's launch site in Boca Chica got underway in 2016, with site soil preparation for the launch pad in a process said to take two years, with significant additional soil work and significant construction beginning in late 2018. By September 2019, the site had been \\"transformed into an operational launch site – outfitted with the ground support equipment needed to support test flights of the methane-fueled Starship vehicles.\\" Lighter construction of fencing and temporary buildings in the control center area had begun in 2014. The Texas launch location was projected in the 2013 draft EIS to include a vertical launch area and a area for a launch control center and a launch pad directly adjacent to the eastern terminus of Texas State Highway 4. Changes occurred based on actual land SpaceX was able to purchase and replat for the control center and primary spaceship build yard. SpaceX broke ground on the new launch site in September 2014, but indicated then that the principal work to build the facility was not expected to ramp up until late 2015 after the SpaceX launch site development team completed work on Kennedy Space Center Launch Pad 39A, as the same team was expected to manage the work to build the Boca Chica facility. Advance preparation work was expected to commence ahead of that. , SpaceX anticipated spending approximately over three to four years to build the Texas facility, while the Texas state government expected to spend to extend utilities and infrastructure to support the new spaceport. The design phase for the facility was completed by March 2015. In the event, construction was delayed by the destruction of one of SpaceX two Florida launch facilities in a September 2016 rocket explosion, which tied up the launch site design/build team for over a year. In order to stabilize the waterlogged ground at the coastal site, SpaceX engineers determined that a process known as soil surcharging would be required. For this to happen, some of new soil was trucked to the facility between October 2015 and January 2016. In January 2016, following additional soil testing that revealed foundation problems, SpaceX indicated they were not planning to complete construction until 2017, and the first launch from Boca Chica was not expected until late 2018. In February 2016, SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell stated that construction had been delayed by poor soil stability at the site, and that \\"two years of dirt work\\" would be required before SpaceX could build the launch facility, with construction costs expected to be higher than previously estimated. The first phase of the soil stabilization process was completed by May 2016. tracking station antenna installed at the control center Two S-band tracking station antennas , were installed at the site in 2016–2017, Formerly used to track the Space Shuttle during launch and landing, and made operational as tracking resources for manned Dragon missions in 2018. A SpaceX-owned photovoltaic power station was installed on site to provide off-grid electrical power near the control center, The solar farm was installed by SolarCity in January 2018. Progress on building the pad had slowed considerably through 2017, much slower than either SpaceX or Texas state officials had expected when it was announced in 2014. Support for SpaceX, however, remained fairly strong amongst Texas public officials. In January 2018, COO Shotwell said the pad might be used for \\"early vehicle testing\\" by late 2018 or early 2019 but that additional work would be required after that to make it into a full launch site. SpaceX achieved this new target, with prototype rocket and rocket engine ground testing at Boca Chica starting in March 2019, and suborbital flight tests starting in July 2019. In late 2018, construction ramped up considerably, and the site saw the development of a large propellant tank farm, a gas flare, more offices, and a small flat square launch pad. The Starhopper prototype was relocated to the pad in March 2019, and first flew in late July 2019. In late 2018, the \\"Mars Crossing\\" subdivision developed into a shipyard, with the development of several large hangars, and several concrete jigs, on top of which large steel rocket airframes were fabricated, the first of which became the Starhopper test article. In February 2019, SpaceX confirmed that the first orbit-capable Starship and Super Heavy test articles would be manufactured nearby, at the \\"SpaceX South Texas build site.\\" By September 2019, the facility had been completely transformed into a new phase of an industrial rocket build facility, working multiple shifts and more than five days a week, able to support large rocket ground and flight testing. As of November 2019 the SpaceX south Texas Launch Site crew has been working on a new launch pad for its Starship/Super Heavy rocket; the former launch site has been transformed to an assembly site for the Starship rocket.  Operation  Vertical launch area of the SpaceX Texas facility, from the FAA draft EIS, April 2013. Starhopper The South Texas Launch Site is SpaceX's fourth active suborbital launch facility, and its first private facility. , SpaceX leased three US government- owned launch sites: Vandenberg SLC 4 in California, and Cape Canaveral SLC-40 and Kennedy Space Center LC39A both in Florida. The launch site is in Cameron County, Texas, approximately east of Brownsville, with launch flyover range over the Gulf of Mexico. The launch site is planned to be optimized for commercial activity, as well as used to fly spacecraft on interplanetary trajectories. Launches on orbital trajectories from Brownsville will have a constrained flight path, due to the Caribbean Islands as well as the large number of Oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX has stated that they have a good flight path available for the launching of satellites on trajectories toward the commercially valuable geosynchronous orbit. Although SpaceX initial plans for the Boca Chica launch site are to loft robotic spacecraft to geosynchronous orbits, Elon Musk indicated in September 2014 that \\"the first person to go to another planet could launch from [the Boca Chica launch site]\\", but did not indicate which launch vehicle might be used for those launches. In May 2018, Elon Musk clarified that the South Texas launch site will be used exclusively for Starship. By March 2019, two test articles of Starship were being built, and three by May. The low-altitude, low-velocity Starship test flight rocket was used for initial integrated testing of the Raptor rocket engine with a flight-capable propellant structure, and was slated to also test the newly designed autogenous pressurization system that is replacing traditional helium tank pressurization as well as initial launch and landing algorithms for the much larger rocket. SpaceX originally developed their reusable booster technology for the 3-meter- diameter Falcon 9 from 2012 to 2018. The Starhopper prototype was also the platform for the first flight tests of the full-flow staged combustion methalox Raptor engine, where the hopper vehicle was flight tested with a single engine in July/August 2019, but could be fitted with up to three engines to facilitate engine-out tolerance testing. Starhopper currently stands to the side of the launchpad, hosting what appears to be radar equipment. The launch site has been the main production and testing site of the Starship/Super Heavy system. All Starship vehicles have been constructed here besides the Mk2 prototype, which was built in Florida but never completed, and eventually scrapped. By March 2020, SpaceX had doubled the number of employees onsite for Starship manufacturing, test and operations since January, with over 500 employees working at the site. Four shifts are working 24/7—in 12-hour shifts with 4 days on then 3 off followed by 3 days on and 4 off—to enable continuous Starship manufacturing with workers and equipment specialized to each task of serial Starship production.  Social and economic impact  The new launch facility was projected in a 2014 study to generate of economic activity in the city of Brownsville and eventually generate approximately in annual salaries from some 500 jobs projected to be created by 2024. A local economic development board was created for south Texas in 2014—the Cameron County Space Port Development Corporation (CCSPDC)—in order to facilitate the development of the aerospace industry in Cameron County near Brownsville. The first project for the newly established board is the SpaceX project to develop a launch site at Boca Chica Beach. In May 2015, Cameron County transferred ownership of 25 lots in Boca Chica to CCSPDC, which may be used to develop event parking.  Effects on nearby homeowners  The launch facility was approved to be constructed two miles from approximately thirty homes, with no indication that this would cause problems for the homeowners. Five years later in 2019, following an FAA revaluation of the environmental impact and the issuance of new FAA requirements that residents be asked to voluntarily stay outside their houses during particular tanking and engine ignition tests, SpaceX decided that a couple dozen of these homes were now too close to the launch facility over the long term and began seeking market acquisition of these properties. Use of eminent domain to acquire the properties has not been ruled out. An attorney with expertise on such situations referred to the timeframe given by SpaceX for homeowners to consider their purchase offer as \\"aggressive\\".  Research facilities  The Brownsville Economic Development Council (BEDC) is building a space tracking facility in Boca Chica Village on a site adjacent to the SpaceX launch control center. The STARGATE tracking facility is a joint project of the BEDC, SpaceX, and the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley (formerly the University of Texas at Brownsville at the time the agreement was reached).  Tourism  In January 2016, the South Padre Island Convention and Visitors Advisory Board (CVA) recommended that the South Padre Island City Council \\"proceed with further planning regarding potential SpaceX viewing sites.\\" See also * List of spaceports * SpaceX reusable launch system development program References External links * SpaceX gets preliminary FAA nod for South Texas launch site, Waco Tribune-Herald, 16 April 2013. * Lone Star State Bets Heavily on a Space Economy, New York Times, 27 November 2014.

It also describes the difference between trade secrets and patents under Canadian law.  Background  In 1969, a new cocktail known as the Bloody Caesar was created in Calgary, Alberta. The main ingredients of a Bloody Caesar are tomato juice, clam broth and vodka.CBC News (13 May 2009). \\"Calgary's Bloody Caesar hailed as nation's favourite cocktail\\". CBC NewsCalgary. Retrieved 31 March 2013. Shortly thereafter, Duffy-Mott, an American juice manufacturer, began to produce and market a mixture of tomato juice, clam broth and spices under the name Clamato.Clamato. Retrieved March 31, 2013 The Bloody Caesar became one of the most popular cocktails in Canada, greatly increasing sales of Clamato in Canada along the way. In 1977, Duffy-Mott decided to license the manufacturing and marketing of Clamato to British Columbian company, Caesar Canning. Duffy- Mott gave Caesar Canning information about how to manufacture Clamato. Caesar Canning used this information, along with spice packs (also received from Duffy-Mott), to produce Clamato. Caesar Canning was able to successfully increase the market share of Clamato in Canada. With consent from Duffy-Mott, Caesar Canning entered into a sublicensing agreement with FBI Foods Ltd., which produced Clamato for the Eastern Canadian market. In 1982, Cadbury- Schweppes purchased Duffy-Mott and only a few months later, they informed Caesar Canning they would be terminating the Clamato licensing agreement. As part of the licensing agreement, Caesar Canning had an industry-standard no- compete-type agreement, which stated that, after the licence's termination, Caesar Canning would not produce, manufacture or distribute any product \\"which includes amongst its ingredients, clam juice and tomato juice\\" for a period of five years or any product with a name ending with the letters -MATO.Cadbury Schweppes Inc v. FBI Foods Ltd, [1994] BCJ No 1191 (25 May 1994) at paragraph 47. In response to the loss of the licence, Caesar Canning used the formula for Clamato (which it had received from Duffy-Mott) to create a new type of mixing-juice. In order to avoid breaching the licensing agreement, the product contained tomato juice, but no clam juice. With the help of FBI Foods Ltd., Caesar Canning was able to market this juice across Canada, under various trade names. In the court reports, judges referred to all of these products collectively as Caesar Cocktail. While the product successfully gained market share from Clamato, Caesar Canning did not survive as an independent company and declared bankruptcy in 1985. In 1986, FBI Foods Ltd. purchased Caesar Canning's assets and continued to sell Caesar Cocktail. Cadbury-Schweppes did not take immediate action against FBI Foods Ltd. or Caesar Canning because they believed neither company had breached the licensing agreement, given that no clam juice was used to produce Caesar Cocktail. However, in 1986, Cadbury- Schweppes realized they might, in fact, have a case against FBI Foods Ltd. for breach of confidence. They sued FBI Foods Ltd. for having knowingly and improperly used confidential information which Cadbury-Schweppes' predecessor, Duffy-Mott had given to Caesar Canning solely for the purpose of producing Clamato under licence, not for producing its own competing product.  Case History   Supreme Court of British Columbia  The case was first heard by Justice Carol Huddart of the Supreme Court of British Columbia.Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods, [1994] BCJ No 1191 (25 May 1994). Justice Huddart ruled in favour of Cadbury Schweppes after applying the test for whether confidential information had been misused that was laid down by the Supreme Court of Canada in Lac Minerals Ltd. v. International Corona Resources Ltd.. In that case, it was ruled that a plaintiff can recover for misuse of confidential information when the following three conditions are satisfied Lac Minerals Ltd v International Corona Resources Ltd, CanLII, [1989] 2 SCR 547 (11 August 1989) at paragraph 54.Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods, [1994] BCJ No 1191 (25 May 1994) at paragraph 37. * the information must have the necessary quality of confidence about it * the information must have been imparted in circumstances in which an obligation of confidence arises * there must have been a misuse of that information to the detriment of the confider. In this case, Justice Huddart ruled that the Clamato recipe was confidential information and therefore worthy of protection because Duffy-Mott used time, money and effort to produce it. She then ruled that Caesar Canning and FBI Foods Ltd. had an obligation of confidence based on the licensing contract between Duffy-Mott and Caesar Canning, the common understanding in the food industry that recipes not widely known should be kept confidential and because the recipe had been communicated to Caesar Canning for the limited purpose of producing Clamato under licence. Finally, Justice Huddart ruled that Caesar Canning and FBI Foods Ltd. had misused the information because they used it to produce Caesar Cocktail, a purpose for which they had not been given the information. Justice Huddart ruled that FBI Foods Ltd. and Caesar Canning should be liable for their misuse of Duffy-Mott's Clamato recipe. She ruled that, because Cadbury-Schweppes could not prove they had lost money due to the competition, FBI Foods, Ltd. should only be required to compensate Cadbury- Schweppes for money Caesar Canning saved by not having to develop its own recipe for Caesar Cocktail. This amount was later judged to be $29761.20. Justice Huddart did not order FBI Foods Ltd. to give all of the profits it made from Caesar Cocktail to Cadbury-Schweppes because Cadbury-Schweppes had not requested such a remedy until after she had ruled that FBI Foods Ltd. and Caesar Canning had misused their recipe. She also refused to prohibit FBI Foods, Ltd. from continuing to use the recipe on the basis that FBI Foods could have figured out how to replicate the recipe on its own and because Cadbury-Schweppes's four-year delay in bringing suit would make it unfair to require FBI Foods to discontinue producing a product that it had been producing for years.  British Columbia Court of Appeal  Both parties appealed the order of Justice Huddart to the British Columbia Court of Appeal.Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods, [1996] BCJ No 1813 (15 August 1996). Cadbury-Schweppes believed that Justice Huddart should have awarded them higher damages as well as an injunction. FBI Foods Ltd. appealed Justice Huddart's ruling, arguing that the contract did not prohibit them from using the confidential recipe, only from using a recipe including both clam juice and tomato juice. They also argued that the parties did not intend the recipe to be kept confidential \\"for all time\\", and thus they should not be found liable for using it. Justice Mary Newbury, speaking for the B.C. Court of Appeal, dismissed FBI Foods Ltd.'s appeal. She ruled that the duty of confidentiality arose outside of the written terms of the contract. Instead, it arose from the relationship between the parties when the contract was made. She also determined that, in this case, neither Caesar Canning nor FBI Foods Ltd. was ever to use the recipe to produce a copy of Clamato. If either wished to produce its own tomato juice cocktail, they should have created their own recipe. Justice Newbury agreed with Cadbury-Schweppes and therefore ordered FBI Foods Ltd. to pay a higher level of damages and enjoined them from using the recipe to produce Caesar Cocktail. Justice Newbury ruled that the fact that Cadbury-Schweppes did not request an accounting of FBI Foods Ltd.'s profits was because both parties had agreed to delay the determination of damages until after the determination of liability. She also ruled that forcing FBI Foods Ltd. to pay $29761.20 was insufficient, given that Cadbury- Schweppes would not have sold their recipe to FBI Foods Ltd. for this price. To allow FBI Foods Ltd. to essentially \\"buy\\" the recipe at such a low price would damage future confidential business relationships. She ruled that damages should be assessed based on the profits that Cadbury-Schweppes would have made had all sales of Caesar Cocktail for the first 12 months after it entered the market been made by Cadbury-Schweppes and not Caesar Canning. Justice Newbury found that Caesar Canning was more blameworthy for intentionally using the recipe to copy Clamato juice than Cadbury-Schweppes was for not acting against FBI-Foods Ltd. or Caesar Canning until several years had passed, given that Cadbury-Schweppes had not realized that a remedy was available. She therefore ruled that an injunction was appropriate because a court should not countenance a \\"forced sale\\" of confidential information from one party to another.Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods, [1994] BCJ No 1191 (25 May 1994) at paragraph 51.  Supreme Court of Canada  FBI Foods Ltd. appealed the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, arguing that the injunction and award of the first 12 months of profits from Caesar Cocktail overcompensated Cadbury-Schweppes. They claimed that any losses suffered by Cadbury-Schweppes were due to Cadbury- Schweppes's own cancellation of the licensing agreement, not from competition from Caesar Cocktail, and that therefore they should not have to provide any compensation. Cadbury-Schweppes cross-appealed, arguing that Caesar Canning and FBI Foods Ltd. had effectively \\"pirated\\" their secret recipe and that they should therefore be compensated for the full market value of the recipe, as if it had been patented.Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods, [1999] SCR 142 (28 January 1999) at paragraph 2. The decision of the whole Supreme Court of Canada was written by Justice Ian Binnie. Justice Binnie agreed with the trial judge and the British Columbia Court of Appeal that FBI Foods Ltd. had misused Cadbury-Schweppes's confidential information, and that the only thing for the Supreme Court to consider was the remedy to grant Cadbury-Schweppes. He felt that it would first be necessary to examine the special nature of the misuse of confidential information as a cause of action. Justice Binnie noted that there was no uniform way to examine the wrong done by a party that misuses the confidential information of another party. The victim of the misuse may have a claim to an equitable remedy against the misuser, as well as a cause of action under property law, contract law and tort law. The remedies available for each of these types of wrongs could differ. Rather than let every case for misuse of confidential information turn on how best to characterize a plaintiff's harm, Justice Binnie thought it best to consider misuse of confidential information as its own sui generis claim and to provide remedies based on what is most just given the particular facts of a case. In this case, Justice Binnie felt that, for several reasons, it would not be just to impose an injunction on FBI Foods Ltd. preventing them from producing Caesar Cocktail using the recipe based on the Clamato recipe. First, he agreed with Huddart J. that Cadbury-Schweppes's delay in seeking an injunction until after FBI Foods Ltd. had invested considerably in the production of Caesar Cocktail would make an injunction unfair. Second, he felt that there was \\"nothing very special\\" about the Clamato recipe, given that any skilled juice-maker could have made a juice that tastes substantially similar to Clamato within 12 months (as he said in the judgment \\"Juice formulation is not rocket science\\").Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods, [1999] SCR 142 (28 January 1999) at paragraphs 48, 64. He ruled that it would be unfair to prohibit FBI Foods Ltd. from using a recipe they could easily have re-created. Finally, he ruled that, because Cadbury-Schweppes could be adequately compensated by a monetary award, an injunction would be unnecessary. In determining the value of the monetary award that Cadbury-Schweppes should receive, Justice Binnie rejected Cadbury- Schweppes's request to be compensated for the market value of their secret recipe for Clamato. He ruled that treating the recipe as if it were patented would be wrong, given that Cadbury-Schweppes had not fulfilled their side of the patent \\"bargain\\".Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods, [1999] SCR 142 (28 January 1999) at paragraph 46. If Cadbury-Schweppes had wanted patent protection, they should have made their recipe public and accepted the time- limited monopoly that a patent grants. Justice Binnie felt that the fairest remedy would be to compensate Cadbury-Schweppes for the lost opportunity they suffered as a result of FBI Foods Ltd.'s and Caesar Canning's misuse of their recipe. Had the recipe not been misused, Cadbury-Schweppes would have had the opportunity to market Clamato in Canada without competition until Caesar Canning or FBI Foods Ltd. could figure out how to create a juice similar to Clamato. Justice Binnie agreed with the trial court that this period should be limited to 12 months. He ruled that FBI Foods Ltd. should have to compensate Cadbury-Schweppes for any profits lost due to this competition. Given that not everyone who purchased Caesar Cocktail during the 12-month period would have purchased Clamato instead, had Caesar Cocktail not been on the market, he ruled that this amount should not be based solely on the amount of Caesar Cocktail sold in the 12-month period. He directed a referee to determine an appropriate amount of damages based on Cadbury-Schweppes lost opportunity, but noted that \\"[m]athematical exactitude is neither required nor obtainable.\\"Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v.

FBI Foods Ltd. He felt that the Supreme Court had deviated from the established principle in Brickenden v. London Loan & Savings Co. of Canada.Brickenden v. London Loan & Savings Co. of Canada, [1934] 3 DLR 465'Juice Formulation is Not Rocket Science' and Other Observations: Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd\\", (1999-2000) 31 Ottawa L Rev 243 at paras 63, 64 In Brickenden, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (whose decisions were binding on Canada at the time of Brickenden) dealt with a situation where party in a fiduciary situation failed in its duty to disclose material facts, causing his principal to incur losses. The Council in Brickenden ruled that the fiduciary should not be able to avoid liability for those losses by arguing that, in the hypothetical case that the material facts had been disclosed, the losses would have happened anyway.Brickenden v. London Loan & Savings Co. of Canada, [1934] 3 DLR 465 at para 15 Rotman thought that the rule in Brickenden should apply to cases where someone misuses information that they received in the context of a fiduciary relationship. Had the rule in Brickenden been applied in Cadbury Schweppes, FBI Foods Ltd. would not have been able to reduce its liability by arguing that, in the hypothetical situation where FBI Foods Ltd. or Caesar Canning had formulated their own recipe for Clamato, they would have been able to do so in 12 months. By eliminating the ability of someone who breaches a duty to rely on speculative hypotheticals, Rotman felt that the following the approach in Brickenden would better deter wrongdoing than the approach used Cadbury Schweppes.Leonard I Rotman, \\"'Juice Formulation is Not Rocket Science' and Other Observations: Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v.

It claims to be the first biopic on the life of Steve Jobs after his death. The film stars Justin Long, who had previously starred in Apple's Get a Mac ad campaign, as Jobs and Jorge Garcia as Steve Wozniak. The film was written in three days and shot in five by Ryan Perez, a former Saturday Night Live writer. Cast In order of appearance Crew *Directed by: Ryan Perez *Producer: Allison Hord *Written by: Ryan Perez *with additional material by: Danny Jelinek, Anne Rieman, Allison Hord, Charles Ingram, Nick Corirossi and Brad Schultz Critical review As a free release on the Internet, the movie went unseen by film critics, with most public reactions coming from tech and business bloggers. According to Forbes, early reviews are mixed. Wired reviewer Mat Honan stated that the movie was \\"profoundly unfunny\\" and that \\"If 'Funny or Die' is a promise, the crew should probably start coffin shopping.\\" Honan claims that the film has several inaccuracies but also notes that the film is a parody, which somewhat offsets that. CNET reviewer Amanda Kooser also notes that the movie \\"cut a few corners as far as accuracy goes\\". Kooser notes that the film succeeded, in a sense, in beating Ashton Kutcher's Jobs to market as the first Steve Jobs biopic after his death (Pirates of Silicon Valley had been produced and released in 1999, 3 years after Jobs returned to Apple). Kooser also notes that the movie had rampant anachronistic technology term usage. Variety reviewer AJ Marechal notes that the movie, which was written in three days and shot in five, \\"has its funny moments\\", but that it may be \\"too long\\", especially for the Funny or Die viewership. The New York Times critic Brooks Barnes described the movie as a \\"biopic poking fun at biopics\\" and said that writer Ryan Perez said \\"In true Internet fashion, it’s not based on very thorough research — essentially a cursory look at the Steve Jobs Wikipedia page\\". Barnes also noted that the movie also bested a third Jobs movie in the works by Aaron Sorkin adapted from Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson with input from Wozniak to the market. Fortune reviewer Philip Elmer-DeWitt describes the movie as \\" an over-long Saturday Night Live skit that never quite gets rolling\\", but noted it had a few things going for it. Macworld reviewers Dan Moren and Lex Friedman provided one of the few positive reviews describing the movie as a humorous Jobs biography that \\"...is surprisingly amusing, provided you are both a fan of Apple and of stupid comedy, and presuming you also don’t mind a little profanity sprinkled in for good measure.\\" Forbes reviewer noted that the scheduled April 15 release was delayed 2 days due to the Boston Marathon bombings.

Located in the city of Midland, Michigan, they annually grow more than 3,000 dahlia plants. History Artist and teacher Charles Breed and his wife Ester moved to Midland in 1950 because of Alden B. Dow's architecture. A gift of dahlia tubers to Ester from daughter Crisann on mother's day in 1966 began Charles Breed's fascination with dahlias. Twenty-five growing seasons later, Charles possessed 1,700 tubers. His design studio was located on West Main Street, next to a vacant lot on the corner of Main and Orchard Drive. Bill Fisher purchased that unimproved parcel in 1968, intending to build condominiums there. Breed declined to sell his property several times, recalling that Alden Dow had told him that the only hill in Midland should have a special purpose. In 1992, Breed was given permission from Bill Fisher to plant dahlias on the vacant hillside property. Fisher Contracting brought in 200 cubic yards of topsoil, and Charles began planting his tubers, establishing Dahlia Hill. Breed constructed a new design studio and gallery on his adjoining property in 1997, which included a work room and storage space for dahlias. Fisher put in an irrigation system and expanded the planting area. The Dahlia Hill Society of Midland was incorporated in 1998 and began fund-raising to acquire the land where the flower garden was located. Midland lawyer John Riecker donated his time over a two-year period to form the non-profit entity, and his wife Ranny wrote a check to cover the $20,000 shortfall when the property was purchased from Fisher Contracting in August, 2000 for $175,000. A volunteer board of directors was elected in 2002, and they hired an administrative director. Heavy rains caused erosion problems in the mid-2000s, so a new fund-raising campaign was started in 2006 to pay for improvements. Stone slabs were ordered from an Escanaba quarry and eight stone terraces were constructed in 2007 at a cost of $290,000. The tiered garden was dedicated in 2008, along with four cast aluminum sculptures representing the four seasons/cycles of life, a gift from Charles Breed. Three stone stairways ascend the hill, with two large raised planters at the top. One is a memorial circle where cremated remains can be mixed with soil to become dahlias. The other is a donor circle containing the names of contributors on plaques for the founders, various improvement projects, and the endowment. According to Breed, Dahlia Hill is dedicated to Alden B. Dow because his talent, generosity and philosophy helped make the city of Midland unique. Today A small-flowered \\"cactus dahlia\\". The garden presently is planted according to a plan each May and includes more than 250 varieties within the 3,000 dahlias planted. There is no monetary fee associated with membership in the society, but each member must commit to work at least 15 hours at the garden and attend biannual meetings. Inexperienced members may request a mentor to assist in row maintenance. Members receive ten tubers in the spring, and may pick a limited number of stems during peak blooming times. The dahlias are watered automatically, but members work on each row to remove weeds, stake and prune deadheads. Two weeks after the first frost, usually in late September, the tubers are uprooted, washed, divided, labelled and placed in climate controlled storage until the spring. Attributes In contrast to most other flower societies, Dahlia Hill does not grow for competition or flower shows. Their goal is to educate people about dahlias, and show dahlias in a garden setting. There is no admission for visitors and no annual dues for members, so the society relies on donations and fundraising events to cover expenses. Dahlia tubers multiply during the growing season, so surplus tubers are sold in late May after planting is complete. Businesses or individuals may sponsor a dahlia row in honor or memory of friends, family or events. A Memorial Circle atop the hill is reserved for the cremated remains of loved ones, along with a memorial plaque. The society also maintains a \\"Book of Memory\\" that contains a life history of those memorialized. Endowment To guarantee the future of the society, donors are encouraged to remember the society's endowment fund in their estate planning. The Midland Area Community Foundation maintains the Dahlia Hill Society Endowment Fund #244. In 2011, Charles Breed put his vacation home on Long Lake near Traverse City, Michigan into a charitable remainder trust. It was sold the following year and, upon his and his wife's deaths, the trust will go to Dahlia Hill to help secure the future of the organization's free admission policy. Recognition Dahlia Hill has received two City of Midland beautification awards and the Keep Michigan Beautiful organization honored Dahlia Hill with the President's Plaque in 2010. The PBS television show, “Destination Michigan” recommended Dahlia Hill to its viewers, as did the Detroit Free Press. “The American Gardener” magazine included a six-page article about Dahlia Hill in their July/August 2012 issue. In 2013, the organization and its founder, Charles Breed, were recognized with a President's Award from the American Dahlia Society.

He was famous for his works, representing a genre of painting which he had introduced, the abstract landscape painting. He was one of the most important representatives of the so-called Modern Greek art.  Early life and education  Thanassis Stephopoulos was born in Amfissa, Phocis. His father, who was a self-taught iconographer, died in 1931. In 1946 completed his school studies while attending the preliminary section of the Athens School of Fine Arts with professors Dimitrios Biskinis and Pavlos Mathiopoulos, and in 1947 with Yiannis Moralis. From 1947 on, he continuously showed his work to Spyros Papaloukas and Nikos Hadjikyriakos-Ghikas, from whose advice/guidance he benefited greatly. In 1952 he received a painting diploma with two honors \\"Outdoors\\" and a \\"Certificate of the Theoretical and Historical Lessons\\". From 1952 to 1954 he attended classes in engraving by the master Giannis Kefallinos, one of the most important Greek art teachers. In May 1954, he received a scholarship from the University of Athens for two years and from 1956 to 1957 a scholarship from the State Scholarship Foundation and continued his studies in Paris.  First Period  In Paris, he studied painting at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts from 1954 to 1957 under the direction of Maurice Brianchon. Alongside, during 1954 and 1955, he studied lithography with professor René Jaudon. From 1955 to 1957 at the École pratique des hautes études he studied architectural analysis of the ancient Greek style and anecdotal evidence for Delphi with professor Pierre de La Coste-Messelière who was also the department manager. In 1958 he attended the first and second year of studies at the École du Louvre and also the general history of art. Having studied for many years in Greece and abroad, with guidance from important artists he continued until 1964. The resulting sensory perception in this first period of his work is the series of Nature morte, which were exposed for the first time in France at the Musée d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, in Salon d'Automne at Grand Palais, at Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen and elsewhere. Many art critics have studied his paintings and in the newspaper Beaux-Arts M.Sauriere wrote: \\"...la belle nature morte aux oiseaux noirs de Stephopoulos...\\"  Second Period  Contemplation of the Aegean In the second period he was evidently in search of freedom. This search is interpreted in the re-composition of plastic elements of the painting, creating new pictures in the spirit of abstraction. These quests, which started in 1959, and lasted for over ten years, were exposed for the first time in 1960 in individual exhibitions on \\"New Forms\\" and \\"Astor\\". Abstraction will henceforth affect in different ways his work until the end.  Third Period  In the third period there are elements from his previous work, featuring himself and his motion. In the latter period, overcoming difficulties and arbitrariness that we meet to divide the life and work of an artist into periods, accumulating plastics expressing contemplation, soul searching, contemplation, usually creating three zones which remind us of the counterpoint in music. Thus creating his own artistic space.

D. F. Kitto.Cited on the back cover of the Pelican paperback edition, 1970 The book was first published as a hardback copy by Penguin Books, but has been republished in several formats since its initial publication. The Greeks serves as an introduction to the whole range of life in ancient Greece and established Kitto as one of the foremost Grecian scholars of his time. Kitto begins the book: Chapters # Introduction # The Formation of the Greek People # The Country # Homer # The Polis # Classical Greece: The Early Period # Classical Greece: The Fifth Century # The Greeks at War # The Decline of the Polis # The Greek Mind # Myth and Religion # Life and Character # Index Reception The book's critical reception was positive, with the Sunday Times and Observer both praising The Greeks; several textbooks list it as a source or recommended read on the subject of ancient Greece. The Princeton Alumni Weekly praised Kitto for \\"not [glossing] over the failures and imperfections of the Greeks\\", and said the book would \\"delight the reader interested in things Greek with a fresh and vigorous approach to the classics\\". The Greeks is mentioned in one of the best selling philosophy books of all times, Zen & The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (1974) by Robert Pirsig (USA). In chapter 29 Pirsig uses The Greeks to expand on one of his key concepts, that of Quality. He finds it to be aligned to the Old Greek concept of Virtue and the Hindu concept of Dharma.

Early life Vartan attended Constantinople's first American missionary school. He joined the British army, serving in the Crimea as an interpreter, but after witnessing the dreadful inadequacies of battlefield medical facilities he resolved to become a surgeon. Medical training and mission in Palestine After his initial Crimean experiences he traveled to Edinburgh where he trained as a doctor under the auspices of the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society (EMMS). He married Mary Anne Stewart, a Scottish nurse, and immediately after the wedding he and his bride left for Palestine. Vartan's work was sponsored by the EMMS to whom he reported every quarter. With fundraising led by William Thomson, he was able to start the Nazareth Hospital. These documents provide valuable evidence of his struggle to set up the hospital in the face of the unshakeable faith of local people in old wives' tales, leeches and bone-menders as well as their prejudices against Evangelical missionaries. When he arrived in Nazareth in 1861, average life expectancy was 22 years for males and 24 years for females. The first floor of the house he rented housed the dispensary, with a separate room for four beds. That was in the area of the Old Suuq today. The extended house eventually became inadequate and, after many difficulties, the land on which the present hospital stands was purchased in 1906. Patients came from Nazareth and the surrounding countryside for medical care. In addition, hospital staff ran clinics in the villages neighboring Nazareth. When the Free Church of Scotland mission wanted advice about starting their own missionary work, they asked him. The Vartan family were members of Christ Church, Nazareth. John Zeller, the pastor of the church, assisted Vartan with his work in founding the Nazareth Hospital. Vartan died in 1908. An iris ('Iris vartanii') was named by Sir Michael Foster after Dr. Vartan.

Hayes and F.H. Ali. 2016. \\"Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks: Applications and Routing Protocols\\". Handbook of Research on Next Generation Mobile Communications Systems. IGI Global. . pp.256-292. can simply be defined as a wireless sensor network (WSN) in which the sensor nodes are mobile. MWSNs are a smaller, emerging field of research in contrast to their well-established predecessor. MWSNs are much more versatile than static sensor networks as they can be deployed in any scenario and cope with rapid topology changes. However, many of their applications are similar, such as environment monitoring or surveillance. Commonly, the nodes consist of a radio transceiver and a microcontroller powered by a battery, as well as some kind of sensor for detecting light, heat, humidity, temperature, etc. Challenges Broadly speaking, there are two sets of challenges in MWSNs; hardware and environment. The main hardware constraints are limited battery power and low cost requirements. The limited power means that it's important for the nodes to be energy efficient. Price limitations often demand low complexity algorithms for simpler microcontrollers and use of only a simplex radio. The major environmental factors are the shared medium and varying topology. The shared medium dictates that channel access must be regulated in some way. This is often done using a medium access control (MAC) scheme, such as carrier sense multiple access (CSMA), frequency division multiple access (FDMA) or code division multiple access (CDMA). The varying topology of the network comes from the mobility of nodes, which means that multihop paths from the sensors to the sink are not stable. Standards Currently there is no standard for MWSNs, so often protocols from MANETs are borrowed, such as Associativity-Based Routing (AR), Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV), Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) and Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR).B. Karp and H. T. Kung. 2000. GPSR: Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing for Wireless Networks. In Proceedings of the 6th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking (MobiCom '00). pp.243-254. MANET protocols are preferred as they are able to work in mobile environments, whereas WSN protocols often aren't suitable. Topology Topology selection plays an important role in routing because the network topology decides the transmission path of the data packets to reach the proper destination. Here, all the topologies (Flat / Unstructured, cluster, tree, chain and hybrid topology) are not feasible for reliable data transmission on sensor nodes mobility. Instead of single topology, hybrid topology plays a vital role in data collection, and the performance is good. Hybrid topology management schemes include the Cluster Independent Data Collection Tree (CIDT).R. Velmani, and B. Kaarthick, 2014. An Energy Efficient Data Gathering in Dense Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks,” ISRN Sensor Networks, vol. 2014, Article ID 518268, 10 pages. doi:10.1155/2014/518268. and the Velocity Energy- efficient and Link-aware Cluster-Tree (VELCT);R. Velmani, and B. Kaarthick, 2015. An Efficient Cluster-Tree Based Data Collection Scheme for Large Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks. IEEE Sensors Journal, vol. 15, no. 4, pp. 2377–2390. doi: 10.1109/JSEN.2014.2377200. both have been proposed for mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs). Routing Since there is no fixed topology in these networks, one of the greatest challenges is routing data from its source to the destination. Generally these routing protocols draw inspiration from two fields; WSNs and mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs). WSN routing protocols provide the required functionality but cannot handle the high frequency of topology changes. Whereas, MANET routing protocols can deal with mobility in the network but they are designed for two way communication, which in sensor networks is often not required.T.P. Lambrou and C.G. Panayiotou. 2009. A Survey on Routing Techniques Supporting Mobility in Sensor Networks. In Proceedings of the 5th international conference on Mobile Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks (MSN'09). pp.78-85. Protocols designed specifically for MWSNs are almost always multihop and sometimes adaptations of existing protocols. For example, Angle-based Dynamic Source Routing (ADSR),S. Kwangcheol, K. Kim and S. Kim. 2011. ADSR: Angle-Based Multi-hop Routing Strategy for Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks. In proceedings of the IEEE Asia-Pacific Services Computing Conference (APSCC). pp.373-376. is an adaptation of the wireless mesh network protocol Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) for MWSNs. ADSR uses location information to work out the angle between the node intending to transmit, potential forwarding nodes and the sink. This is then used to insure that packets are always forwarded towards the sink. Also, Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) protocol for WSNs has been adapted to LEACH-M (LEACH-Mobile),D. Kim and Y. Chung. 2006. Self-Organization Routing Protocol Supporting Mobile Nodes for Wireless Sensor Network. In proceedings of the 1st international multi-symposiums on Computer and Computational Sciences (IMSCCS’06). pp.622-626. for MWSNs. The main issue with hierarchical protocols is that mobile nodes are prone to frequently switching between clusters, which can cause large amounts of overhead from the nodes having to regularly re- associate themselves with different cluster heads. Another popular routing technique is to utilise location information from a GPS module attached to the nodes. This can be seen in protocols such as Zone Based Routing (ZBR),U. Ahmed and F.B. Hussain. 2011. Energy efficient routing protocol for zone based mobile sensor networks. In proceedings of the 7th international Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing conference (IWCMC). pp.1081-1086. which defines clusters geographically and uses the location information to keep nodes updated with the cluster they're in. In comparison, Geographically Opportunistic Routing (GOR),Y. Han and Z. Lin. 2012. A geographically opportunistic routing protocol used in mobile wireless sensor networks. In proceedings of the 9th IEEE international conference on Networking, Sensing and Control (ICNSC). pp.216-221. is a flat protocol that divides the network area into grids and then uses the location information to opportunistically forward data as far as possible in each hop. Multipath protocols provide a robust mechanism for routing and therefore seem like a promising direction for MWSN routing protocols. One such protocol is the query based Data Centric Braided Multipath (DCBM).A. Aronsky and A. Segall. 2010. A multipath routing algorithm for mobile Wireless Sensor Networks. In proceedings of the 3rd Joint IFIP Wireless and Mobile Networking Conference. pp.1-6. Furthermore, Robust Ad-hoc Sensor Routing (RASeR)T. Hayes and F. Ali. 2016. Robust Ad-hoc Sensor Routing (RASeR) Protocol for Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks. Elsevier Ad Hoc Networks, vol. 50, no. 1, pp. 128-144. and Location Aware Sensor Routing (LASeR)T. Hayes and F. Ali. 2016. Location Aware Sensor Routing (LASeR) Protocol for Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks. IET Wireless Sensor Systems, vol. 6, no. 2, pp. 49-57. are two protocols that are designed specifically for high speed MWSN applications, such as those that incorporate UAVs. They both take advantage of multipath routing, which is facilitated by a 'blind forwarding' technique. Blind forwarding simply allows the transmitting node to broadcast a packet to its neighbors, it is then the responsibility of the receiving nodes to decide whether they should forward the packet or drop it. The decision of whether to forward a packet or not is made using a network- wide gradient metric, such that the values of the transmitting and receiving nodes are compared to determine which is closer to the sink. The key difference between RASeR and LASeR is in the way they maintain their gradient metrics; RASeR uses the regular transmission of small beacon packets, in which nodes broadcast their current gradient. Whereas, LASeR relies on taking advantage of geographical location information that is already present on the mobile sensor node, which is likely the case in many applications. Medium access control There are three types of medium access control (MAC) techniques: based on time division, frequency division and code division. Due to the relative ease of implementation, the most common choice of MAC is time- division-based, closely related to the popular CSMA/CA MAC. The vast majority of MAC protocols that have been designed with MWSNs in mind, are adapted from existing WSN MACs and focus on low power consumption, duty-cycled schemes.  Validation  Protocols designed for MWSNs are usually validated with the use of either analytical, simulation or experimental results. Detailed analytical results are mathematical in nature and can provide good approximations of protocol behaviour. Simulations can be performed using software such as OPNET, NetSim and ns2 and is the most common method of validation. Simulations can provide close approximations to the real behaviour of a protocol under various scenarios. Physical experiments are the most expensive to perform and, unlike the other two methods, no assumptions need to be made. This makes them the most reliable form of information, when determining how a protocol will perform under certain conditions. Applications The advantage of allowing the sensors to be mobile increases the number of applications beyond those for which static WSNs are used. Sensors can be attached to a number of platforms: * People * Animals * Autonomous Vehicles * Unmanned Vehicles * Manned Vehicles In order to characterise the requirements of an application, it can be categorised as either constant monitoring, event monitoring, constant mapping or event mapping. Constant type applications are time-based and as such data is generated periodically, whereas event type applications are event drive and so data is only generated when an event occurs. The monitoring applications are constantly running over a period of time, whereas mapping applications are usually deployed once in order to assess the current state of a phenomenon. Examples of applications include health monitoring, which may include heart rate, blood pressure etc.H. Yan, H. Huo, Y. Xu and M. Gidlund. 2010. Wireless Sensor Network Based E-Health System – Implementation and Experimental Results. IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics, vol. 56, no. 4, pp. 2288-2295.

Buddhist, Confucian, Parsee. Mohammedan, Jewish and other faiths, and from representatives of the various churches of Christen- dom, full and accurate statements of the spiritual and other effects of the religions which they hold upon the literature, art, commerce, government, domestic and social life of the peoples among whom these faiths have prevailed. # To inquire what light each religion has afforded, or may afford, to the other religions of the world. # To set forth, for permanent record to be published to the world, an accurate and authoritative account of the present condition and outlook of religion among the leading nations of the earth. # To discover, from competent men, what light religion has to throw on the great problems of the present age, especially the important questions connected with temperance, labor, education, wealth and poverty. # To bring the nations of the earth into a more friendly fellowship, in the hope of securing permanent international peace.An Account of the Parliament of Living Religions, Wembley, London 1924  Dignitaries  Main participants and religious representatives * Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmud Ahmad (Islam) *Sir Francis Young-Husband *Pandit Shyam Shankar *Al-Haj Khwaja Kamal-ud-Din *Mustafa Khan *Sheikh Kahdim El Dojaily *Sufi Hafiz Raushan Ali *Dr. W.A. de Silva *Mr. G.P.

Crankshaft close-up Note the tight spacing of the connecting rod between the crankshaft webs in the 3rd cylinder from the left. Although this seems impossible at first glance, the geometry of the engine does permit this overlap. The big-end bearings of connecting rods are wider (along the crank axis) than the thickness of the rod itself. By making the crank webs with an offset to them, it is possible to place the main bearings closer together, closely sandwiching the rod passing between them, where this is now a narrower gap than the bearing size. The main bearings are similarly confined and each main bearing can be supported by only a thin wall across the crankcase. The difficulty with these engines is in their manufacture. The overall shape of the crankshaft and its webs is not a problem, but finishing the bearing surfaces by grinding is. There is no longer access for the large abrasive discs of a crankshaft grinder to reach each bearing, the offset crankshaft webs now being in the way. As a result, each bearing must be made and finish-ground individually; then assembled into a built-up crankshaft, usually by shrink-fitting. One of the few engines to use undercut crankshafts was the Bugatti U-16 aircraft engine, a typical Bugatti approach, where only their unlimited budget and attention to detail could afford such complexities. The U-16 engine also had each 8-cylinder crankshaft built as two 4-cylinder crankshafts, assembled by a bolted taper joint. This joint may be seen at the left-hand side of the close- up drawing. The French Chaise 100 hp engine of 1930 used a similar built up crankshaft with a 'quincunx' (staggered) cylinder layout to give a short, compact engine.

History  The first racing at Stockbridge took place on Houghton Down from, at the latest, 1775, and possibly earlier. By 1839 a new course had been developed on Danebury Hill near Nether Wallop. The course is associated with leading Victorian trainer John Day who, together with stable jockey Tom Cannon, sent out multiple Classic winners. He trained from stables at Danebury House, built in 1832 by Lord George Bentinck, adjacent to the track and now the headquarters of a winery. Another important, but short-lived figure in the history of the course was Harry, Marquis of Hastings who had horses trained at Stockbridge in the 1860s. A notable visitor to the track was King Edward VII, who whilst still Prince of Wales watched his horse, Counterpane, come last in the Stockbridge Cup and then fall down dead. It is reported that souvenir hunters pulled out every hair of its tail. Horses were often entered and shown at the Swan Inn in Stockbridge. Race week was usually in June or July. The track had a straight mile and a severe 'elbow'. In the years before its closure, the major races at the course were: *Bibury Stakes - a 1 1/2 mile handicap, worth £251 in 1898 *Stockbridge Cup Stakes - a 6 furlong race, worth £290 *Hurstborne Stakes - a 5 furlong race for two-year- olds, worth £622 *Arlington Plate - a mile handicap, worth £460 *Champagne Stakes - a 5 furlong race for two-year-olds, worth £340  Closure  In 1898, the land on which the eastern end of the course stood was inherited by Marianne Vaudrey who strongly disapproved of gambling, and therefore refused to extend the lease. At the time, Jockey Club rules stated that all racecourses should have a straight mile and since Stockbridge's straight mile extended into this area of land, the course was forced to close. The final meeting took place on 7 July 1898. After closure, the gallops served as a testing site for Spitfires during World War II. Meanwhile, the Bibury Club Grandstand, which opened in 1867, survived until 1973, when it was destroyed by fire. The ivy-covered ruins of the Grandstand remain, but are in a precarious condition. Today, the ground on which the course stood is part of the Danebury Racing Stables estate owned by trainer Ken Cunningham-Brown. The Southern half of the course is now part of an organic dairy farm farmed by A Burnfield & Sons Ltd.

Its tectonic evolution can be divided in three periods. The first period was from Paleocene to Oligocene. Starting in the Paleocene, Taixinan Basin had been experiencing the effect of rifting, which eventually caused the formation of the basin. The tensile stress field was in the NE-SW direction. Many normal faults developed at this period. The second period was the end of Oligocene. During this period, the Taixinan Basin experienced the effect of compression. Part of the early normal faults underwent tectonic inversion, and a lot of reverse faults and related folds developed. The third period was the thermal subsidence beginning from Miocene. Since the late Miocene, the South China Sea basin stopped its expansion. During this period, the sediment layers are horizontal and basically not controlled by the effects of faulting.\\"台西南盆地新生代主要断裂发育特征\\" by 丁巍伟, 王渝明, 陈汉林, 杨树锋, and 吴能有\\"南海北部深水盆地沉积－构造的差异性及其油气意义\\" by 吕宝凤 and 袁亚娟\\"南海盆地生物礁形成条件及发育趋势\\" by 魏喜, 祝永军, 尹继红, 陈亦寒, and 刘东齐 Topography The Taixinan Basin is in the direction of NE, with a length of about 400 km, average width of 150 km, and an area of more than 60000 km2.

Summary/Bio Rabbi Dweck is American born, of Syrian-Sephardi origin, and has lived in Los Angeles, California and Brooklyn, New York. He studied in Jerusalem at Hazon Ovadia Yeshiva under the tutelage of former Rishon LeZiyon, Sephardi Chief Rabbi of Israel Ovadia Yosef and his son, Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef, the current Rishon LeZiyon. Rav Ovadia Yosef referred to Rabbi Dweck as his \\"heart's desire\\" and \\"the esteemed Rabbi who brings merit to the community\\" in an approbation written for Dweck's book on Jewish blessings, Birkhot Shamayim. Rabbi Dweck received his Semikha (rabbinic ordination) from Rav Ovadia Yosef under the auspices of the Sephardic Rabbinical College of Brooklyn, New York. In 1995 he married Margalit Bar Shalom, a granddaughter of Rav Ovadia Yosef. Margalit is the daughter of Dayan Ezra Bar Shalom and Adina (Yosef) Bar Shalom. Rabbi Dweck studied for three years (1996–99) at the YULA Kollel in Los Angeles under Rabbi Nachum Sauer. In 1999 he moved with his wife and oldest son to Brooklyn, New York to become a fellow of the newly established Sephardic Rabbinical College under the direction of Rabbi Shimon Alouf, where he studied for the next seven years. He also studied psychology and philosophy at Santa Monica College in Los Angeles and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Liberal Arts from Excelsior College. His philosophy leans toward the rational approach to Judaism. He received a Master of Arts Degree in Jewish Education from Middlesex University in collaboration with The London School of Jewish Studies.  Career  Hazan (Cantor) In his earlier years, Rabbi Dweck trained as a Hazan (cantor) in Israel under famed Hazan Moshe Habusha and later in Brooklyn, NY, under Rabbi Refael Elnadav. In 1999, he joined Sha’are Shalom, a Syrian synagogue in Brooklyn, NY as their Hazan. Community Rabbi Shortly thereafter, he was asked to assume the position as rabbi of the congregation, a position he held for 15 years. Under his guidance, the synagogue flourished, as the original 50 members grew into over 350 families, with Rabbi Dweck deeply involved in all aspects of daily community life. Teacher Rabbi Dweck began his formal teaching career as a high school teacher of Jewish Law and Philosophy at Magen David Yeshiva in Brooklyn, New York where he taught for two years. From 2005-2008, Rabbi Dweck taught Mishna at Barkai Yeshiva in Brooklyn, NY. He assumed the role of Hebrew Principal in 2009, and later became Rosh Yeshiva/Head of School in 2010, a position he served for 4 years. Head of School Rabbi Dweck centred Barkai’s core visionon the concept that “the Author of the Torah is the Author of the world”. As such, all students were taught the five books of the Torah, establishing a comprehensive framework of thought, with secular studies taught uncompromisingly through the lens of Torah. This encompassed all aspects throughout the curriculum, including art and physical education. Head of S&P; Sephardi Community In 2013, Rabbi Dweck was appointed Senior Rabbi of the Spanish and Portuguese Jews’ Congregation of the UK, later rebranded The S&P; Sephardi Community. Rabbi Dweck was elected with a 270-4 vote, a margin believed to be the largest in UK synagogue history. On Sunday, September 24th 2014, Rabbi Dweck was officially installed as Senior Rabbi at the community's cathedral synagogue, Bevis Marks. The Jewish Chronicle reported that: \\"Religious leaders from across the Anglo-Jewish spectrum, from Liberals to Lubavitch, came to celebrate the arrival of the fresh-faced new leader, aged just 39, at the community's oldest congregation. Dayanim from the Federation and United Synagogue and a large contingent from independent Sephardi communities attended, as well as Emeritus Chief Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks, who took part in the ceremony.\\" In his inaugural address Rabbi Dweck said: \\"The most precious element of [The S&P;'s] history are the ideas and the thinking that came from my predecessors because of their commitments not only to Jewish life, observance and continuity but also because they taught our Torah within a relevant and rational framework. This trend of traditional observance, coupled with immersion in the world and society, is the crowning glory of our Sephardi tradition.\\" He went on to say that Judaism should be available to the community in 'High Definition’. As Head of S&P;, Rabbi Dweck’s responsibilities include: * Oversight of the religious functions of the various member synagogues * Setting the strategic and spiritual vision for the community * Overseeing the Sephardi Bet Din * Spiritual Head of The Sephardi Kashrut Authority (SKA) * Ambassador and Spokesperson for the community at various national and international forums * Interacting with Jewish students on university campuses across the UK Annual Scholar-In-Residence with The SCA Despite no longer living in the USA, Rabbi Dweck has maintained a close and warm relationship with the Sephardic Community Alliance. He participates in many of their programs and is an especially popular Scholar-in-Residence during their annual summer programming for the Syrian community in Deal, NJ. Honorary Roles In his capacity as Senior Rabbi, Rabbi Dweck has the honor of serving as the Deputy President of the London School of Jewish Studies; a President of The Council of Christians and Jews along with the Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, The Archbishop of Canterbury and other religious heads; and Ecclesiastical Authority of The Board of Deputies of British Jews. Rabbi Dweck also serves as a member of the Standing Committee of the Conference of European Rabbis. In 2015, the Jewish News in conjunction with the Jewish Leadership Council published '40 Under 40', listing young members of the British Jewish Community at the forefront of Jewish life, with Rabbi Dweck listed 4th among the top 10.  Online Presence  Rabbi Dweck is also known for his online presence, reaching audiences around the globe by offering regular content on his mobile app, blog, and social media pages: * RJD Mobile App * Rabbi Dweck Blog * Rabbi Dweck YouTube Page * Rabbi Dweck Instagram * Rabbi Dweck Facebook Controversy In May 2017, Rabbi Dweck gave a lecture in London as part of his Perspectives series in Hendon, in which he presented his approach regarding the Torah view on homosexual love, declaring that Jewish law does not legislate against the feelings involved (sexual relations, he stated, are prohibited by the Torah). He suggested that contemporary developments on this issue, while problematic, are also \\"a fantastic development to humanity\\" as they force humanity to rethink the question of love, and potentially remove the stigma associated with platonic love and affection between men. He preceded his words with caveats and stated his awareness of the controversial nature of the topic, explaining that he had been thinking about it for years and felt the need to discuss it because \\"no one was talking about it openly in Orthodox Judaism.\\" This lecture proved highly controversial and while some welcomed and supported it, others strongly rejected it, including Rabbi Aharon Bassous and the Beth Din of the prominent Haredi Rabbi Nissim Karelitz. Rabbi Dweck issued a clarification letter explaining his Halakhic stance and intentions. Some of his many audio and video lectures were dissected by his rabbinic detractors, and more seemingly controversial opinions of his were criticised. Consequently, in July 2017, an agreement was achieved, led by British Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, together with Dayan Chanoch Ehrentreu (Av Beth Din of Europe), Dayan Menachem Gelly (Rosh Beth Din of The London Beth Din), and Dayan Avraham David (Rosh Beth Din of the Sephardi Beth Din), who questioned Rabbi Dweck on his statements and teachings, and concluded that he continue his role as the Senior Rabbi of the Sephardi community. Rabbi Dweck agreed to step down from the Jewish legal position of a Judge (Dayan) of the Sephardi Beth Din. However, as Senior Rabbi, Rabbi Dweck maintains oversight of the Beth Din and appoints its dayyanim. In addition, his future public lectures that presented innovative approaches were to be subjected to rabbinic review, for a time. The former British Chief Rabbi, Lord Jonathan Sacks, publicly expressed his support for Rabbi Dweck. In January 2018, Rabbi Dweck resumed his lectures with a new series at the London Jewish School of Studies, at a sold-out return to Hendon.

It was first published by Routledge in 2005. Bradley questions whether a distinction can be drawn between ritual and non-ritual behaviour in prehistoric Europe, citing ethnographic comparisons and archaeological examples to suggest that ritualised activities were a part of domestic life and agriculture. Synopsis Part One, \\"The Importance of Ordinary Things\\", opens with chapter one, \\"Death and the Harvest\\", in which Bradley looks at the manner in which archaeologists have differentiated between ritual and domestic life. Discussing the Galician hórreos, or raised storehouses, he uses them as an example to highlight that both ritual and domestic features can be found in the same structure. Moving on to other archaeological examples, he discusses Durrington Walls in Wiltshire, England, and then the viereckschanzen of southern Germany and Bohemia. He then rounds off the chapter with a discussion of what ritual is, citing the work of social anthropologists and ritual studies scholars like Jack Goody, Maurice Bloch and Catherine Bell, emphasising that ritual is a form of action. Chapter two, \\"The consecration of the house\\" explores ritual elements in the domestic sphere, beginning with an examination of Gamla Uppsala and moving on to suggest that across Northern Europe, houses were used as cultic buildings on certain occasions., citing ethnographic examples from the Maori of New Zealand. Bradley proceeds to an examination of instances where graves have been placed over houses in prehistoric Europe.

The term 'damage' primarily refers to the additional loss of the propagating optical signal leading to decreased power at the output end which could lead to premature failure of the component and or system. Description In the professional literature, the effect is often named Radiation Induced Attenuation (RIA). The loss of power or 'darkening' occurs because the chemical bonds forming the optical fiber core are disrupted by the impinging high energy resulting in the appearance of new electronic transition states giving rise to additional absorption in the wavelength regions of interest. Once radiation source is removed, the fiber returns to its original state to some extent (a process called recovery). The extent of damage is governed by the balance between defect generation (excess attenuation) on one hand and defect annihilation (recovery) on the other hand. If the dose rate is low, an equilibrium state (between attenuation and recovery) is reached with some degree of darkening. On the contrary if the dose rate is high, the utility of fiber depends on the overall induced attenuation and the recovery time. Understanding these radiation induced effects is important particularly for space based applications where optical fibers are being considered for use in increasing number of applications.http://www.nufern.com/library/item/id/231/ Defects Intrinsic defects are present in the matrix of a single component glass material like pure silica. These include per-oxy linkages, POL (≡Si-O-O-Si≡) which are oxygen interstitials, and oxygen deficient centers, ODC (≡Si-Si≡) which are oxygen vacancies. When exposed to ionizing radiation, these sites trap holes to form per-oxy radicals, POR (≡Si-O-O.) and E’ centers (≡Si.), respectively. In addition, rapidly cooled silica has strained ≡Si-O-Si≡ bonds, which are cleaved upon radiation to form non-bridging oxygen hole centers (NBOHC) depicted as ≡Si-O. and E’ centers by trapping holes and electrons, respectively.E.J. Friebele and D.L. Griscom: Radiation Effects in Glass, Academic Press, NY, 1979 When the glass contains a second network former with the same valence as silicon such as germanium, the difference in the electronegativities favors the dopant as a hole trap. Greater damage Hence greater radiation damage occurs in doped silica glass. To improve radiation resistance of pure silica core fibers, it is necessary to minimize the number density of these intrinsic defects. Minimization of defects is achieved not only by reducing the incorporation of impurities in glass but also by controlling the input gas composition, optimizing the thermal history of glass at all stages of fiber manufacturing and optimizing the stress in the fiber core. Other strategies include incorporation of dopants (such as fluorine) in the core that minimize formation of defect centers discussed above. Optical fibers All optical fibers undergo some darkening depending on a number of factors that include: ionization type, optical fiber core glass composition, operating wavelength, dose rate, total accumulated dose, temperature and power propagating through the core. Since attenuation is composition dependent, it is observed that fibers having pure silica cores and fluorine down doped claddings are amongst the most radiation hard fibers. The presence of dopants in the core such as germanium, phosphorus, boron, aluminum, erbium, ytterbium, thulium, holmium etc. compromises the radiation hardness of optical fibers. To minimize damage consequences, it is better to use a pure silica core fiber at higher operating wavelength, lower dose rate, lower total accumulated dose, higher temperature (accelerated recovery) and higher signal power (photo- bleaching). In addition to these intrinsic steps, external engineering may be required to shield the fiber from the effects of radiation.http://www.nufern.com/library/item/id/254/ Core fibers Germanium-doped core fibers can be radiation hard even at high concentrations of germanium. Such fibers reach saturation, anneal well at higher temperatures and are also responsive to photo-bleaching. In case of phosphorus-doped core fibers, attenuation increases linearly with increasing phosphorus content and these fibers do not reach saturation. Recovery is very difficult even at higher temperatures. Boron, aluminum and all the rare-earth dopants significantly affect fiber loss. Radiation performances of various SM, MM and PM fibers manufactured by different vendors that were tested in wide range of radiation environments have been compiled.

From 1985 until her death she worked at Santa Clara University's religious studies department, of which she was chair from 2000 to 2005. Born in New York City, she studied at Manhattanville College and University of Chicago Divinity School before briefly teaching in Japan at the Seishin Joshi Gakuin and International University of Japan. Returning to the United States, she began work at Santa Clara in 1985, devoting her research to Chinese ritual, resulting in her most prominent publication, Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice (1992). In 1998 she became the Bernard Hanley Professor of Religious Studies, before becoming chair of the religious studies department in 2000. Retiring due to persistent health problems in 2005, she continued to research until her death. Biography Born in New York City, Bell undertook her undergraduate studies at Manhattanville College, gaining a double-major BA in philosophy and religion in 1975. She proceeded to complete her MA in the History of Religion at the University of Chicago's Divinity School in 1976, continuing with a PhD there, completed in 1983. Moving to Japan, she taught at the Seishin Joshi Gakuin in Tokyo from 1982 to 1983, before moving to the International University of Japan in Nigata in 1983. She then undertook a post-doctoral fellowship for Chinese language study in Taiwan. Covering the costs for her international research, she obtained award fellowships from the Mellon Foundation, the American Council of Learned Societies, and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Becoming a fellow of the Center for Chinese Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, and involved in their Chinese Popular Culture project, her studies of ritual praxes in Chinese religions led to her book Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice, published in 1992. In 1985 she began work at Santa Clara University. Focused on teaching undergraduates, courses she ran included \\"Ways of Studying Religion,\\" \\"Asian Religions,\\" \\"Magic, Science and Religion,\\" \\"Time and the Millennium\\" and \\"Religion and Violence,\\" each of which she based around a core intellectual question. Involved in restructuring the department's curriculum, in 1996 she was awarded the Brutocao Award for Excellence in Curriculum Innovation. She was also involved in the creation of a Women's Faculty Group and Faculty Development Program to aid junior members in the department. In 1998 she was named Bernard Hanley Professor of Religious Studies, that year being awarded the College of Arts and Sciences' Beyma Research Award. In 2001 she was then awarded the President's Award for distinction. Bell served as chair of the department from 2000 to 2005, then stepping down to become professor emeritus; she took early retirement due to an inability to cope following her diagnosis with multiple sclerosis in 2000. In 2005, the University of Chicago Divinity School named her \\"Alumna of the Year\\", on their website praising her as \\"a great scholar and teacher... [and] a skilled administrator\\". She began work on a new project, Believing: Assuming Universality, Describing Particularity in the Study of Religion, funded by another fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities, but it was left unfinished at the time of her death. Her unfinished manuscript, titled Believing and the Practice of Religion, was later stored in Santa Clara's university library. Bell died aged 55 on 23 May 2008, after a long illness. She was survived by her mother, sister, three brothers, and husband, Steven Gelber, who was a professor of history at Santa Clara. The chair of the Santa Clara religious studies department, Paul Crowley, described her as \\"a magnificent colleague, a scholar of international standing, [and] an inspiring mentor to generations of students\\". Historian of religion Reza Aslan asserted that she would be remembered for generations to come due to her \\"rigorous scholarship\\", and that she was \\"unmatched\\" as an academic. Having known her personally, Aslan also commented on her \\"razor sharp wit, her boundless compassion, and refusal to accept anything but the best from her students.\\" Published work Ritual Theory, Ritual Practice The work was published in two editions, the original Oxford University Press edition in 1992, and an edition also from Oxford University Press in 2009 with a new prologue, which is also available in electronic versions. Both editions share the same pagination. Religious studies scholar Diane Jonte-Pace opined that the book \\"changed the framework for understanding the nature and function of ritual\\", constituting Bell's \\"greatest contribution\\" to religious studies. Having known Bell personally, Jonte-Pace thought that the book exhibited her \\"fearless intellectual style\\" and \\"sense of freedom\\" from past frameworks. Historian of religion Reza Aslan claimed that it \\"launched a revolution\\" in the way that scholars understood the subject, becoming \\"required reading\\" for students of religious studies. It was awarded \\"Best First Book in the History of Religions\\" from the American Academy of Religion in 1994. Because of the importance of this work for the field of ritual studies, a survey of the work is in order. The book is organized into three major sections: \\"The Practice of Ritual Theory\\" (chapters 1-3), which generally surveys the prior work in the field and situates Bell's book in that context; \\"The Sense of Ritual\\" (chapters 4-6), which develops the concept of ritual in terms of bodies and the external systems within which they work; and \\"Ritual and Power\\" (chapters 7-9), which frames the discussion of ritual in society, with the attending questions of power and authority. =Chapter 1, Constructing Ritual= Catherine Bell introduces the study of ritual theory in chapter 1. (19) She presents the idea of dichotomies and how they differentiate between conceptual blueprints (such as beliefs and myths) and ritual (something acted out). Ritual is seen as a performance of conceptual orientations. (19) Bell integrates the ideas and theories of Edward Shils, Durkheim, Stanley Tambiah, Victor Turner, Marshall Sahlins and Claude Levi-Strauss all pertaining to ritual studies. Ritual is understood as a structural mechanism that reintegrates the two opposing dichotomies of thought and action, which is equivalent to the belief and behavior dichotomy. (20) In the sense of community, ritual is seen as a way to create a collective set of beliefs or ideals. In an ever changing society, ritual is the bridge between tradition and constant social change. (20) Ritual symbolism plays a role in the natural struggle of humans with their moral self and external “socio- political” order and constraints of the world. (24) However, this theory of ritual symbolism is seen as incomplete because 1) it does not have any cultural analysis in its explanation and 2) it does not take into consideration the duality of human nature. Bell reestablishes the different dichotomies that are at play against one another: continuity and change, individual experience and social forms, beliefs and behaviors, and thought and action. (25) =Chapter 2, Constructing Meaning= Catherine Bell maintains the idea that a successful ritual is one in which both cultural and sociological aspects work together. (34, 35) Bell bases her model of ritual on three elements: ritual as an activity, as a fusion of thought and activity, and the dichotomy between actor and thinker. (31) Ritual performs and enacts a system of symbols by integrating the conceptual and dispositional (i.e., the worldview and ethos). Ritual actors integrate worldview and the ethos (conceptual and dispositional) while the theorist integrates these conceptual categories. (32) Building on the idea of the \\"acting actor\\", (31) ritual is now seen as “cultural performance” (37) and is “dramatisized”. (38) Comparing symbols with either indexicality or iconicity allows for many interpretations of symbolism. (42) Iconicity, for example, within Christianity might include all images of a man hanging on a cross symbolize to a crucifix (reference: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/crucifix) . Ritual may be understood as communication among people, rather than individuals with the divine. (43) An Islamic example might be going to \\"jumu'ah\\" so others perceive the actor as pious. After a debate of what meaning is, from the views of Clifford Geertz and Stanley Jeyaraja Tambiah, the next dichotic lens in which to view ritual is drama vs. performance. (43-44) Drama insinuates the individual participating in the ritual is like an actor; they are simply doing the actions and saying things, while their internal thoughts are irrelevant. (43) Performance may simply be the act of the ritual, the participant may be disregarded. Through text analogy one may see ritual as a text. (43) Text may be seen as unchanging, knowable and designed to be knowable, yet when studying text one may interpret and analyze it for oneself; that allows for variation of meaning, change over time, fluidity, which is essential for ritual. (43-45) However, texts are made to communicate directly with a reader, yet not all rituals communicate in the same way. (45) =Chapter 5, The Ritual Body= The body is seen in various ways with different functionalities and uses, where some view its purpose as a connector between the individual and society. (94) Bell discusses the ideas of Durkheim, Mauss, and Hertz on the body, arguing that bodily expressions are social in nature and acquired in practice. (94) In contrast to this perception, Bell includes Lakoff’s argument that these basic categories are inherent and rooted in the sociobiological body. (96) Bell argues that the body is no longer a physical instrument to perform rituals but in fact a social body that connects to society. (97) The ritualized body is one that contains a ‘sense’ of values of ritual.(98) The ritual body is produced through interactions of the body with structure and a structured environment, therefore forming a relationship between the body and the environment around it, such as Muslims' prayer in a mosque. The actions that take place in a “ritual space” have a connection to the environment because it molds the way the environment is presented.(100) Yet the physical actions such as standing up straight or kneeling down during salat do not express inner states such as emotions or intentions of the individual. What one individual sees in terms of ritual action is not the display of one's inner state or values.(100) Many rituals take part in certain performances that are mandated by the authority of history, such as Muslims sacrificing animals on the day of Eid Al-Adha. If one believes in the exact repetition of an age-old ritual in the present day then no ritual style is autonomous.(101) Bell describes a hierarchical system created via linguistic or physical means and organized by the creation of oppositions through ritualization. (104) She describes that although these oppositions may be in contrast, they do not always necessarily balance one another out, and some dominate over others (for example, the receiving of Eucharist (or the inner) dominates the act of lifting and lowering heads (or the outer) in the Catholic church). (102) She describes how the body molds a ritualized agent through the production of a structured environment based on oppositions. (106) However, this interaction of body and environment, or ritualization, simply shifts the nature of social problems to endless circular schemes, where no resolution is produced, only implied. (106-7) Bell holds, ritualized agents see their purpose, but not what they actually do in ritually changing a situation. This is what she states Althusser views as the “...intrinsic blindness of practice.” (108) As far as ritual and language are concerned, Bell states that there are two main controversies: first, comparing ritual language to verbal/textual language; second, the role of aforementioned verbal/textual language in ritual. (110) Bell mentions Tambiah and other scholars see ritual communication as not only another form of expression, but a way of expressing things that would be impossible to express in any other manner. (111) Bell argues language may be the most important part of some rituals. (113) She closes this section stating, “That is to say within the medium of formally explicit discourse, there is nothing there to grasp, just a variety of culturally instinctive and flexible schemes with which to avoid and undermine everything but the ritual acts themselves.” (114) Since there is a difference between thought and action in ritual the same idea applies for what theoretical practice sees and does not see itself doing (the object-unity of theoretical discourse). (114) Seeing and not-seeing is the production of agents embodying sense of ritual constituted by and expressed in particular schemes of ritualization.(114) The schemes start to shape the world and spread out causing disposition of ritualization.(115) Shared culture may strategically transform the way one group practices from another in terms of the simple alterations of actions in ritual, which are then deployed around the area. The saying \\"fake it till you make it\\" is a good way to sum up the thoughts of Bell because as children are younger they learn so many rituals in our respective faiths but it is not until later in life that they give those rituals meaning and practice them as more than mere action. It is necessary to explore the actual contexts of ritualization by looking at a more accurate actions for ritualization, and the history behind the traditions practiced.(117) =Chapter 8, Ritual, Belief, and Ideology= In chapter 8, Bell evaluates the symbiotic relationship between ritual and belief. (182) Bell states that ritual is typically viewed as an expression of belief and holds social power, which generates change. (182) Bell believes that religious belief is understood in many different ways and that personal interpretation makes it difficult to analyze in a social context, despite being social in nature. (183) Bell also points out that belief is complex and its association with ritual is challenged. The intended belief behind ritual may be misunderstood by the participants, indicating that their participation in the ritual may not necessarily support or understand the initial institutional belief. (183) Bell gives a detailed description of two notions of ideology. Although Bell describes two views, she discusses ideology implemented within a society as a way for the dominant class to maintain power and control. (188-92) Bell maintains Gramsci’s belief that the dominated class rarely passively accepts and internalizes the dominant class' values, but instead consents to a more appropriate alternative. (190) She concludes that in this way, ideology is a unifying form of power which creates a greater distribution of control than relationships that exist with the use of pure force. (193) Bell’s presentation maintains the notion that ritual, political power and legitimation of power are three interdependent theories. Historically, ritual was cast as a mere “artifice” used to conceal the \\"brute exercise of real power\\". Thus sacred kingships throughout the past centuries used ritual as a tool to install hierarchy and fulfill political agendas. She invites the readers to question ritual as no longer a self-fulfilling tool but also a power tool for mass governance. Ritual constructs an argument, all while maintaining social order. It does not ‘disguise the exercise of power’ - it is in itself the power. =Chapter 9, The Power of Ritualization= Power and authority play a strong role in Bell's view of ritual: one does not necessarily have both. (197) A person in power may use that control to affect views within society, limiting other's individual autonomy. (198) The power may be used through symbolic power, where it may be used to help understand the actions and meanings of the world. (199) The top of the hierarchy only has power if the bottom responds to the directions from the top. (200) The individual, she concludes, is ultimately in power. (203) Bell seems to present the power relationship between individuals and society as a complex strategy to organize social norms. (204) One aspect of ritualization is the differentiation and privileging of certain activities. (204) Features by which these activities differentiate themselves are not universal. Since ritual is a “way of acting” that is distinguished by a certain culture or situation, generalizing ritual strategies into a universal phenomenon undermines its logic. (205) Ritualizing strategies may be implemented without the involvement of religious activities. The purpose of ritualization might be to incite a controversy or to create certain impressions. Any moderately socialized person may use ritualization, both in its cultural and situational forms, as a strategy by distinguishing or blurring the boundary that makes an activity a “specific way of acting”. (206) Bell suggests that the deployment of ritualization is the construction of power relationships - one of domination, consent or resistance. While ritualization may be an effective strategy of power in some certain conditions, it has specific limits and may even be counterproductive in other scenarios. (206) Ritualization has two basic dimensions. The first dimension is the dynamics of the social body and its projection of a structured environment, where ritualization produces and objectifies the constructions of power. (207) The second dimension illustrates the limits of most ritual practice, which is the empowerment of those who were initially controlled by ritual relations, due to the fact that participation in ritual activities requires a conscious consent. (209) Bell then emphasizes that both participation in ritualization and objectification of power are negotiated processes, and since ritualization may foster a misrecognition of the level of consensus, it limits the social efficacy of ritualization and affects both those who dominate and those who are dominated. (210) Ritualization may be viewed as a source of power and authority for people in a position to influence ritual, and as a source of power for the individual. (211) In one form, ritual may be seen as a “‘blunt tool.’” (212) Bell asserts that ritual power is interpreted as an external power tapped into by whoever holds an office. She maintains that there are three forms of empowerment for those in charge of ritualization: objectification of office, hierarchization of practices, and creating tradition. (211) Furthermore, in some ways ritual defines the self. Tambiah and Bloch in contrast to some other scholars view the formalization of ritual as furthering the divide between one’s sense of self and one’s ritual practices. (216) Bell in part looks at ritual through the lens of individual empowerment. \\"The person who has prayed to his or her god, appropriating the social schemes of the hegemonic order in terms of an individual redemption, may be stronger because these acts are the very definitions of power, personhood, and the ability to act.” (217-8) Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions Bell's second major work was published in 1997. She intended it to be \\"a more holistic and pragmatic orientation to multiple dimensions of the phenomenon of ritual\\" Bell, Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions.

She held a key role in rousing the rebellion. Zylberberg was a member of Hashomer Hatzair,The Book of Jewish Partisans (Sefer ha-Partizanim ha Yehudim), Yad Vashem, Jerusalem 1958–1959, Volume 2: 707. the Zionist- socialist youth movement. After the German invasion of Poland at the onset of World War II, she left the capital for Wilno in northeastern part of prewar Poland (now Vilnius, Lithuania), then returned to Warsaw together with Chajka (Chaikeh) Grossman and was actively involved in the Jewish resistance. Sarenka (Little Roe deer, or Fawn in Polish) was one of the few leaders who actually reentered the besieged ghetto, rather than flee it. She was among the first to set out on an impassioned journey to spread knowledge of the Nazi plan to eradicate the Jews in the Holocaust. Sarenka confronted her peers repeatedly with this information, until she convinced Mira Fuchrer, Mordechai Anielewicz' partner, and eventually Anielewicz himself, as well as other leaders of the movement, of the severity of their situation. In order to reenter the besieged ghetto and rejoin the Hashomer Hatzair Combat Unit, she gave up her daughter Maya, whose later history is unknown. She died in the bunker called Miła 18 beneath the 18 Miła Street in Warsaw, where her name is engraved on a memorial headstone together with those of almost 50 Jewish fighters. Rachel was more familiarly known as Sarenka, which translates into Hebrew as Ofra.

Rachela Zylberberg studied at the Jewish Gymnasia and joined Hashomer Hatzair, where she became member of the \\"Frontline Brigade\\" eventually, along with Mordechai Anielewicz, Commander of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. While in school, she excelled at her studies, excelled also at sports, and was known for her strong organizational abilities. As of 1938, she became a group leader for the younger students who greatly admired her.\\"Destruction and Rebellion of the Warsaw Jews\\", Melech Neustadt, 1946, (1) page 294-295. She received her matriculation certificate just as the Second World War broke out on 1 September 1939 with the German invasion of Poland. Two weeks later, the USSR invaded Poland from the east. In Soviet Lithuania Sarenka escaped to eastern Poland ahead of the German advance, together with her sister Ruth. She initially arrived in Kaidani, which at the time was under the Russian control, joining Ha-Manof Kibbutz, and eventually relocating to prewar Wilno (Vilna) and joining the Hashomer Hatzair Kibbutz there. With her good education, she immediately adopted an important role in kibbutz life. She lived in Vilna with her partner, Moshe Kopito who himself was a close friend of Mordechai Anielewicz; the two men had joined the movement together much earlier. On 22 February 1941, Sarenka's daughter Maya was born.Ofer Aloni, Finding Maya - missing daughter of the Warsaw ghetto rebel. Tel Aviv, Israel. On 22 June 1941 the German army attacked the Soviet positions in eastern Poland under the code-name Operation Barbarossa. Sarenka later described the 'deportation' of Jews from the Ghetto to nearby Ponary in the suburbs of Vilna, where the Ponary massacre was carried out by Nazi Germans and their Lithuanian collaborators. She wrote: Sarenka moved into hiding at the Polish Dominican Convent of the Little Sisters in a forest some outside of Vilna (see: Anna Borkowska (Sister Bertranda), the Polish Righteous Among the Nations who saved them). Reportedly, Sarenka stayed there together with Abba Kovner and Joseph Shamir. In all, some fifteen to 20 comrades hid in the convent together. There, the idea of the uprising took shape, and became based around Kovner's declaration: \\"Let us not go like lambs to the slaughter!\\"Porat, pp 56-73. The connection between the Hashomer Hatzair insurgents and the Catholic convent was arranged by Yodviga Dudezits with the assistance from Irena Adamowicz, later acknowledged as the Polish Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem. Both women belonged to the Polish Scouts Democratic Movement, and both had been hidden by Hashomer Hatzair activists when the city was destroyed by the Russians. After Moshe Kopito was murdered by the Nazis while attempting to buy milk and supplies for their daughter, Sarenka placed Maya at an orphanage in Vilna, under the name Yodviga (Jadwiga) Sogak. Maya (whose whereabouts are not known) is still being sought to this day.Website dedicated to finding Zylberberg's daughter at Exit2hope.org, Internet Archive. At that time, the Hashomer Hatzair leadership in Vilna decided to return Sarenka to Warsaw for partisan action. Chaikeh (Chajka) Grossman was sent by the movement to bring Sarenka back to the capital. Sarenka dressed up as Chaikeh's child even though they both were young, but Chaikeh was the elder of the two. Chaikeh later wrote: \\"This time I didn't come to Warsaw alone. I came with Sarenka. I needed to get Sarenka from Vilna to Warsaw, after the catastrophe with Moshe Kopito, her friend. We decided to transfer her to a family in Warsaw and have her join the action there.\\"\\"The Underground\\", Chaika Grossman [in:] Finding Maya. The purpose of Sarenka's return was to continue leading the youth remaining inside the ghetto, and to assist her family with their grocery store inside the Warsaw Ghetto.

The first was to bear the message, as an eyewitness, of the methodical extermination of Jews in Punar, near Vilna; her fellow Jews had not heard these details until then. The second was to arouse and motivate rebellion against the Nazis from inside the ghetto. On her return to the ghetto, a group of youth united around her, some of whom she had instructed as a counselor. She detailed the Nazi massacre. > One day we were called to our brigade meeting with the new young woman > delegate from the Vilna Ghetto. I think her name was Sarenka (or perhaps > Rachel)?

These welds are commonly referred to as tee joints, which are two pieces of metal perpendicular to each other, or lap joints, which are two pieces of metal that overlap and are welded at the edges. The weld is triangular in shape and may have a concave, flat or convex surface depending on the welder’s technique. Welders use fillet welds when connecting flanges to pipes and welding cross sections of infrastructure, and when bolts aren't strong enough and will wear off easily.Althouse p.185 Making a fillet weld with gas metal arc welding There are two main types of fillet weld: traverse fillet weld and parallel fillet weld. Aspects Parts of a fillet weld There are 5 pieces to each fillet weld known as the root, toe, face, leg and throat.Hultenius p.3 The root of the weld is the part of deepest penetration which is the opposite angle of the hypotenuse. The toes of the weld are essentially the edges or the points of the hypotenuse. The face of the weld is the outer visual or hypotenuse that you see when looking at a fillet weld. The legs are the other two sides of the triangular fillet weld. The leg length is usually designated as the size of the weld. The throat of the weld is the distance from the center of the face to the root of the weld. Typically the depth of the throat should be at least as thick as the thickness of metal you are welding. Notation Fillet weld notation Intermittent fillet welds Fillet welding notation is important to recognize when reading technical drawings. The use of this notation tells the welder exactly what is expected from the fabricator. The symbol for a fillet weld is in the shape of a triangle. This triangle will lie either below a flat line or above it with an arrow coming off of the flat line pointing to a joint. The flat line is called \\"reference line\\". The side on which the triangle symbol is placed is important because it gives an indication on which side of the joint is to be intersected by the weld. It is recognized that there are two different approaches in the global market to designate the arrow side and other side on drawings; a description of the two approaches is contained in International Standard ISO 2553, they are called \\"A-System\\" (which is more commonly used in Europe) and \\"B-System\\" (which is basically the ANSI/AWS system used in the US). In \\"A-System\\" two parallel lines are used as reference line: one is a continuous line, the other is a dashed line. In the \\"B-System\\", there is only one reference line, which is a continuous line. If there is a single reference line (B-System) and the triangle is positioned below the line, then the weld is going to be on the arrow side. If there is a single reference line (\\"B-System\\") and the triangle is positioned above the line, then the weld is going to be on the opposite side of the arrow.ISO 2553:2013 When you find an arrow pointing to a joint with two triangles, one sitting below and one sitting above the line even with each other, then there is intended to be a fillet weld on the arrow side of the joint as well as the opposite side of the joint.Althouse p.186-190 If the weld is to be continuous around a piece of metal such as a pipe or square, then a small circle will be around the point where the flat line and arrow pointing to the joint are connected.Haque, pages 2-6 Manufacturers also include the strength that the weld must be. This is indicated by a letter and number combination just before the flat line. Examples of this are \\"E70\\" meaning the arc electrode must have a tensile strength of . There are also symbols that describe the aesthetics of the weld. A gentle curve pointing away from the hypotenuse means a concave weld is required, a straight line parallel with the hypotenuse calls for a flat faced weld, and a gentle curve towards the hypotenuse calls for a convex weld. The surface of the weld can be manipulated either by welding technique or by use of machining or grinding tools after the weld is completed. When reading a manufacturers technical drawings, you might also come across weld dimensions. The weld can be sized in many different ways such as the length of the weld, the measurements of the legs of the weld, and the spaces between welds. Along with a triangle, there will usually be a size for the weld for example (”x”) to the left of the triangle. This means that the vertical leg of the weld is to be ” whereas the horizontal leg is to ”. To the right of the triangle, there will be a measurement of exactly how long the weld is supposed to be.Haque, p. 4 If the measurements of the drawing are in mm the welds are likewise measured in mm. For example, the weld would be 3 x 10, the mm being understood automatically. Intermittent fillet welds An intermittent fillet weld is one that is not continuous across a joint. These welds are portrayed as a set of two numbers to the right of the triangle instead of just one. The first number as mentioned earlier refers to the length of the weld. The second number, separated from the first by a “-”, refers to the pitch. The pitch is a measurement from midpoint to midpoint of the intermittent welds. Intermittent welding is used when either a continuous weld is not necessary, or when a continuous weld threatens the joint by warping. In some cases intermittent welds are staggered on both sides of the joint. In this case, the notation of the two triangles aren't directly on top of each other. Instead, the side of the joint to receive the first weld will have a triangle further to the left than the following side’s triangle notation. As an end result of alternating intermittent fillet welds at each side, the space between welds on one side of the joint will be the midpoint of the opposite side’s weld.Althouse p.189  See also  * Butt welding * Welding joint Notes References *Hultenius, D.

Shevchenko has a higher profile than the other members of the group. She was the leader of the three FEMEN activists reputedly kidnapped and threatened by the Belarus KGB in 2011. She achieved attention in Ukraine by cutting with a chainsaw and then bringing down a 4-metre high Christian cross in central Kyiv in 2012. In 2013, Shevchenko was granted asylum in France, and now continues her activism by leading FEMEN France from a training base she has established in Paris. In July 2013, Olivier Ciappa, who together with David Kawena designed a new French stamp depicting Marianne, stated on Twitter that Shevchenko had been the main inspiration for the depiction. Early life Inna Shevchenko was born in Kherson near the Black Sea, on 23 June 1990. Inna had a childhood 'like that of all girls. I was brought up as a typical Ukrainian, Slavic girl, and was taught not to shout or argue'. She was a 'patsanka' (tomboy) and was especially close to her father who was a military officer. She also has an older sister. The 2004 Orange Revolution opened her eyes to politics and in the TV shows which pitted journalists against politicians, she said the journalists 'looked more intelligent so I wanted to be one'. She went to university at the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv from 2008 until 2012 where she studied journalism and graduated with honours. Her extracurricular activity as a leader of the student government gave her political connections that helped land her a job in 2009 working for the Mayor's press office in Kyiv. Shevchenko's first language is Russian,Page 31 FEMEN Ackerman, Galia et al. 2013. calmann-levy. Ukrainian is the dominant language in Western Ukraine and to a lesser extend in Central Ukraine; while Russian is the dominant language in Eastern Ukraine and Southern Ukraine (Source: Serhy Yekelchyk Ukraine: Birth of a Modern Nation, Oxford University Press (2007), ). although she is also fluent in Ukrainian, English and FrenchAn interview in fluent French with I. Shevchenko: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNwRC8Hzl3o. Activism & FEMEN  Early years in Ukraine  Inna Shevchenko (left) and Alexandra Shevchenko prepare for the 2010 Kyiv campaign. Shevchenko made contact with two leading FEMEN activists Anna Hutsol and Alexandra Shevchenko (no relation) through the social networking site vKontakte and joined FEMEN early in 2009. Anna Hutsol had formed FEMEN in Kyiv on 10 April 2008, with two friends, Alexandra Shevchenko and Oksana Shachko, from her hometown of Khmelnytskyi; they initially protested on issues affecting woman students, but rapidly moved to demonstrating against the sexual exploitation of Ukrainian women. Inna Shevchenko first demonstrated with FEMEN on 23 May 2009 in Kyiv, against prostitution and under the banner, \\"Ukraine is not a Brothel\\", in collaboration with DJ Hell.Page 96 FEMEN Ackerman, Galia et al. 2013. calmann- levy. Late in August, 2009, Oksana Shachko became the first member of the group to bare her breasts during a protest; but not until 2010 did this become the usual tactic in FEMEN demonstrations, justified on the grounds that without the media attention generated by topless protests their message would not be heard. Femen Les féministes venues du froid , Paris Match (18 February 2012) In debates within FEMEN over the ethics of topless protest, Inna Shevchenko at first opposed the tactic, then was persuaded of its validity. She was fired from her job in the Kyiv Mayor\`s press office after her arrest for taking part in a protest against the absence of women in Prime Minister Mykola Azarov's cabinet in December, 2010, a decision which had angered her very much.  Asylum in France  Shevchenko (centre) plans the next campaign in Paris (2012). On 8 September 2012, Shevchenko cut down wooden crosses at GOGBOT festival in Enschede, the Netherlands, as a protest on the arrest of Pussy Riot., following her cross-chainsawing action in Kyiv in August. 18 September 2012, Shevchenko established a training facility for FEMEN France in Paris. 26 October 2012, when Shevchenko was giving a live interview to the Arab television channel Al Jazeera, she was asked, \\"Which is better for women, nudity or the paranja?\\" She responded by taking off her T-shirt in protest at \\"Medieval prejudices\\". The live picture was immediately cut. In July 2013, Shevchenko was granted asylum in France. Although Shevchenko has come to think of topless protest almost as a working uniform, she still has to overcome her reluctance to bare her breasts before each demonstration. In December 2012, the French magazine Madame Figaro included Shevchenko in its list of the world\`s top 20 iconic women of the year. In July 2013, Olivier Ciappa, who together with David Kawena designed a new French stamp depicting Marianne, stated on Twitter that Shevchenko had been the main inspiration for the depiction. The artist Olivier Ciappa who designed the 2013 image of Marianne on French stamps has stated that the portrait is a 'mixture of several women but particularly Inna Shevchenko'. On hearing this Inna tweeted 'All homophobes, extremists, fascists will have to lick my arse when they want to send a letter'.  Public speaking  Shevchenko speaking at the 2017 International Conference on Free Expression and Conscience. Shevchenko is a speaker at conferences and a columnist for the international press. She was a speaker at a debate on the freedom of speech in Copenhagen on 14 February 2015 with cartoonist Lars Vilks. She was speaking about an illusion that in Western Europe people can fully enjoy freedom of speech when a terrorist opened fire in the lobby of the cultural centre, where the debates took place.

Every day, women are despised, depreciated, soiled, wounded or killed. Every day, women that are hidden in public, locked up at home, deprived of education and prospects for their futures, forced to silence, humiliated, beaten, mutilated, whipped, stoned and burned, accompany us. We can no longer remain silent.The responsibility of religions in the misfortunes of the world crushes our screens and our eyes, but many still refuse to see their role in women's misfortunes. This book was written because we no longer wanted them to believe, but rather to know \\", said the author.

The film was directed by Andrew Neel and filmed almost entirely on cellphone cameras. King Kelly was shown at several 2012 film festivals, including South by Southwest, the Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival, and the Puchon International Fantastic Film Festival where Louisa Krause was awarded \\"Best Actress\\". Plot King Kelly is a teenage webcam porn performer, reveling in the attention and tips from her assorted admirers. Away from the webcam, she films herself constantly with her cellphone's camera, while also being paid to transport drugs around Long Island. On July 4, also her father's birthday, Kelly's ex-boyfriend Ryan takes back the car he paid for, which unfortunately for Kelly still has a package of drugs in the trunk that she was supposed to deliver. After a failed attempt with her friend Jordan to get the car back, Kelly attends the family birthday party, fights with her aunt, and huffs off on foot. Kelly and Jordan go to a friend's party, where Kelly flirts with Jordan's boyfriend, and learns from her drug contact that if she doesn't recover the drugs – which are not pills as she believed, but $20K of heroin – then the owner of said drugs will kill her. Kelly manages to patch her relationship with Jordan, and they drive off in Jordan's father's SUV to find Ryan, who they learn drove the car to a club on Staten Island. Both girls are high on ADHD pills and cocaine, and crash the SUV into a tree. Desperate, Kelly contacts her biggest fan, \\"Poo Bare\\", a state trooper. Poo Bare helps them find the car, but the drugs are not there; he now demands that she sleep with him in return for his forcing Ryan to take them to the missing package. After some more misadventures, they recover the heroin from Ryan's dad's garage. Now very early on July 5, the group goes to a motel. Poo Bare puts both Ryan and the cocaine-addled Jordan in the bathroom – with Ryan handcuffed to the toilet – and he and Kelly proceed to strip and have sex, with Kelly filming them the whole time. Ryan convinces Jordan to get the handcuff keys from Poo Bare's belt; freeing himself, he then shoots Poo Bare in the back with the trooper's gun, then runs outside. Kelly leaves Poo Bare, ordering him to never tell anyone what happened, and with Jordan attempts to chase down Ryan. When they lose him, Jordan runs from the car screaming, but forgets her phone. Kelly discovers that Jordan posted a video of Kelly from early in the film, and the comments on it are less than complimentary. Apparently hurt emotionally, Kelly binges on a pile of cheeseburgers. Reception King Kelly has a 75% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 8 critic reviews.Rotten Tomatoes, \\"King Kelly (2012)\\" http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/king_kelly/ David Noh, writing for Film Journal International, called it \\"One of the cleverest, funniest and most appallingly true films of the year.\\" However, some critics panned the film, such as Slant Magazines Diego Costa, who said \\"the film feels, much like its protagonist's persona, fake. It isn't interested in exploring the nuances of her character, her predicaments, or her contradictions... There's no gravitas, no seriousness.\\" References External links *King Kelly info page at SeeThink Films' website *Official film website * Category:American satirical films Category:American independent films Category:2012 films Category:SeeThink Films films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Andrew Neel ","title":"King Kelly (film)"},{"id":"39139207","text":"Neil Matthews (born 19 September 1966) is an English former football forward who scored 68 goals from 258 appearances in the lower divisions of the Football League.

However, the wounds he sustained in that campaign ended his military career. Gambier-Parry was also known for his work as an author, musician, and artist. He succeeded to the manor at Highnam Court following the death of his half-brother Sir Hubert Parry. In addition, he preserved and archived the art collection that had been amassed by his father Thomas Gambier Parry; the masterpieces were eventually bequeathed to the Courtauld Institute of Art. Background Ernest Gambier- Parry, son of Thomas Gambier-Parry and his second wife Ethelinda Lear, was born on 25 October 1853 at Highnam Court, Highnam, Gloucestershire. His father was an artist, philanthropist, and art collector. His half-brother was the composer Sir Hubert Parry, Thomas Gambier-Parry's son by his first wife Anna Maria Isabella Clinton. Another brother was the architect Sidney Gambier- Parry. His nephew Brigadier Sir Richard Gambier-Parry modernised communications at the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) and was the communications consultant for Operation Tracer in Gibraltar during World War II. Ernest Gambier-Parry was educated at Eton, where he studied under William Evans, the drawing master at Eton, from 1866 to 1871. Career General Gordon's Last Stand Gambier-Parry served in the Volunteers. By 1871, he had joined the Royal North Gloucestershire Regiment of Militia as a supernumerary lieutenant. He was promoted to lieutenant and, on 2 December 1874, he joined the Royal Welch Fusiliers (23rd Regiment of Foot) in that rank. Gambier-Parry became an instructor of musketry to the 2nd Battalion in 1880 and was at the Royal Citadel, Plymouth in 1881. He resigned as instructor of musketry on 22 August 1881. On 14 February 1883, he left the Royal Welch Fusiliers as a lieutenant, and joined the Devon Yeomanry, the Royal 1st Devon. On 12 February 1885, he was given the rank of captain in the army. Gambier-Parry participated as a special service officer in the Suakin Expedition of March 1885 commanded by Major-General Sir Gerald Graham VC, following the Siege of Khartoum, to avenge the murder of General Charles George Gordon in January 1885. The moments before Gordon's death and beheading were portrayed in the painting General Gordon's Last Stand (pictured) by George William Joy. The Suakin Expedition was also an attempt to change the course of the Mahdist War. During the Eastern Sudan campaign of March 1885, Captain Gambier-Parry was seriously wounded. That military campaign in the Sudan was the subject of his published work Suakin, 1885, which he penned during his convalescence. In the preface to that book, he requested \\"the indulgence of critics . . . on behalf of one who has carried a sword more often than a pen.\\" He was appointed as a captain in the reserve of officers on 28 October 1885, and was subsequently promoted to the honorary rank of major on 7 May 1886 for his gallant conduct. He was invalided from the army and resigned his commission. During the First World War, he was commandant of No. 6 Red Cross Hospital in Oxfordshire, the Goring Auxiliary Hospital. Gambier-Parry was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1918. He was the president of the Gloucester Children's Hospital that had been established by his father. He was also a Gloucestershire magistrate. Gambier-Parry had a strong interest in the arts. Not only was he an author; he was also a musician and artist. In addition to Suakin, 1885, Gambier-Parry was the author of Annals of an Eton House with some Notes on the Evans Family, Sketches of a Yachting Cruise, Day-dreams, The Pageant of my Day, Murphy: A Message to Dog-lovers, Allegories of the Land, The Spirit of the Old Folk, Life of Reynell Taylor, and Ainslie Gore: A Sketch from Life. He was a member of the Gloucester Committee of the Three Choirs Festival. He often exhibited his paintings at the Royal Academy and other venues. Gambier-Parry assumed the role of family archivist. He was reluctant to sell the collection of paintings and other art objects that his father had collected over his lifetime. (His younger son Mark similarly attempted to avoid the attention of dealers and instead bequeathed the Gambier-Parry collection intact to the Courtauld Institute of Art.) The Gambier-Parry archive included an 1897 inventory of the estate that Ernest Gambier-Parry compiled and was used in the research of the collection for the Courtauld Institute. His inventory documented prominent members of the art world who were friends of his father and viewed the collection. They included two presidents of the Royal Academy: Sir Frederic Leighton and Sir Edward John Poynter. The former selected works from the collection in 1888 to show in the Royal Academy's Winter Exhibition. After his father's death, Gambier-Parry extended invitations to art experts to view the collection at Highnam. The visits occurred primarily in the 1910s and 1920s. Gambier-Parry documented the visits and the impressions or detailed appraisals offered by the experts. The visitors included Professor Charles John Holmes, director of the National Gallery; Sir Claude Phillips, curator of the Wallace Collection; Roger Eliot Fry; Bernard Berenson; Dr. Raymond van Marle, author of The Development of the Italian Schools of Painting, William George Constable of the National Gallery, and historian Welbore St. Clair Baddeley. Family and later life Highnam Court Gambier-Parry married Evelyn Elizabeth Palk, daughter of Lawrence Palk, 1st Baron Haldon, in 1882. He resided with his wife and children in Goring-on- Thames in 1891, but had moved into Highnam Court (pictured) by 1894. Following the death of his mother Ethelinda Lear in 1896, his half-brother Hubert Parry inherited the Highnam Court estate. The two brothers disagreed over the management of Highnam Court, which was in grave financial difficulty. Ernest Gambier-Parry moved out and his brother moved into Highnam Court. The two brothers remained estranged for the rest of their lives. Gambier-Parry lived in Goring prior to Hubert Parry's death in 1918, at which time he succeeded him to the estate at Highnam Court. Ernest Gambier-Parry and his wife had two children, although neither of their sons ever married. His elder son Thomas Robert Gambier-Parry was a botanist. He also became curator of the Department of Oriental Collections at the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford. His son Robert died in February 1935; his wife Evelyn died that same year. Major Gambier-Parry died on 15 April 1936 at Highnam Court. His younger son, Thomas Mark Gambier-Parry, succeeded to the estate at Highnam Court; Mark resided there until his death on 9 August 1966.

Biography Sherwood was born in 1937 in Budapest, Hungary. With the remains of her Jewish family she emigrated to Australia in 1948. A short stint of employment in New Guinea introduced her to racism and colonialism. She returned to Sydney, attended university as a part-time student and then. as a divorced woman, emigrated to England with her son in 1965. Teaching in London schools introduced her to the many aspects of racism prevalent in the UK. She determined that if it ever became possible, she would do some research on the history of \\"Black\\" peoples in the UK as she wanted to replace fighting with fists to fighting with knowledge. Five years of work in Harlem, New York (1980–85), convinced her that this was necessary. Sherwood has a desk, but is not on the staff of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, University of London.\\"Black and Asian Britain\\" - Seminar Series at ICwS, Institute of Commonwealth Studies. In 1991 with Hakim Adi and other colleagues she founded what is now known as the Black and Asian Studies Association, in order to encourage research and disseminate information, and to campaign on education issues. This is ongoing. In 2007, she published After Abolition: Britain and the Slave Trade Since 1807. Stephen Shapiro, writing in the Ohio State and Miami University history journal Origins, described the book as \\"provocative\\" and \\"a worthwhile read\\" for \\"those interested in British or African history.\\" In 2010 she invited to contribute to the Kwame Nkrumah Centenary Colloquium in Accra, convened by the African Union and the Government of Ghana. Apart from her formal publications listed below, she has also contributed to a number of films, radio programs, conferences. Sherwood set up Savannah Press, a publisher for some of her books \\"at cost\\" prices. In 2017, Sherwood was planning to give a speech about treatment of the Palestinians during University of Manchester's Israel Apartheid Week under the title ‘You’re doing to Palestinians what the Nazis did to me’. The Israeli embassy intervened, contacting the university with concerns that the title violated the Holocaust Society's and UK's adopted definition of antisemitism. Manchester University censored the title and put conditions on the speech. She has written nine entries in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.

Pulingaws are, claimed to be, selected by their electing ancestors known as kinitalian, who often turn out to be the pulingaws' ancestors, which happen to also be another form of spiritual entity called birua. Kinitalians can choose whoever they please as the next pulingaw amongst its immediate or extended family members. Although females were often selected to continue the line of shaman-ism, not all pulingaws are female and there were rare instances where males were selected to take up the role.Cauquelin, J. (2004) The Aborigines of Taiwan; The Puyuma: from headhunting to the modern world. RoutledgeCurzon, London. However, the pulingaws gender issue is still an ongoing debate as certain sources insist that only females become pulingaws.http://140.133.6.46/ETD-db/ETD- search/view_etd?URN=etd-0723110-171901 The pulingaws are considered as therapists, who are responsible for mediating and bringing peace to social and biological disorders. They are also responsible for various rituals that range from hunting ceremonies, exorcisms and funerals.http://www.ipcf.org.tw/ipcf/associate/tribe/tribeDetail.htmlCID=1FE45C38A00FAC61&sn;=AEB8BBC40B9D7837143331A7531EBAF5 Role The pulingaws are considered to be above other mainstream therapists and they have a significant social status of their own within the Puyuma community. They are bestowed the role of averting and curing biological and sociological maladies and at the same time pleasing their electoral spirits, kinitalian. The pulingaws do not receive former training and they are expected to learn their skills by following and imitating what their fellow senior pulingaws would be doing. Their job involves visiting their clients' houses when requested and providing them with spiritual healing processes. Pulingaws are also expected to participate in an annual ritual, known as pualasakan, which happens during the third day of the third moon. The ritual lasts for eight days and during then, the pulingaws perform chants, self-purification using water, ridding their sanctuary of miasma, and on the last night of pualasakan, punlingaws would perform their 'words of offering' and be in the yaulas stage, which is a divine stage that allows the pulingaws to connect with their ancestors' biruas. Pualasakan rituals also include another individual that deals with the supernatural, known as the benabulu, who is often a man.Cauquelin, J. (2004) The Aborigines of Taiwan; The Puyuma: from headhunting to the modern world. RoutledgeCurzon, London Different pulingaws have somewhat similar practices and languages.Cauquelin, J. (2008) Ritual Texts of the Last Traditional Practitioners of Nanwang Puyuma. Institute of Linguistics, Academia Sinica, Taipei. They also perform the yaulas ritual where they perform the yaulas rite and incarnate birua(s) in order to deal with either biological or sociological events. These dealings may pose neutral, beneficial or even detrimental effects. For example, for biological events, if an individual's tinabawan (one of the three souls of an individual) is affected by their ancestral birua, who would most likely be offended or annoyed by the individual's behaviour or actions, the pulingaw would try to summon the birua and rectify the situation. During such rituals, areca nuts and fired clay beads are often used to summon birua or even for exorcising purposes. The areca nuts are also used as repellents for vengeful spirits, who are either animals or birua who had an unpleasant life prior to their deaths or they carried vengeful intentions during the deaths. The main reason why most elected individuals refuse to become a pulingaw is the need to cope with having a double life. Since most pulingaws are females, they are required to carry out their expected roles such as cooking and childcare. Since they have been bestowed with the fate, she also has to attend to patients, whom she cannot refuse unless she is severely ill or injured and that her predicament inhibits her from commuting towards other locations. At times, there would be a need for these pulingaws to leave their own house to attend to housecalls during the day, and they do not return home until late in the next morning. The pulingaws, however, do expect some form of payment from their patients as their birua have informed them that they do not agree to doing 'unpaid' work and if no payment was received, the pulingaw would be the one suffering the punishment from the birua, as mentioned in the previous paragraph that the birua is often summoned to deal with an individual's torment or suffering. These payments used to come in the form of a few coins or areca nuts since fees are paid according to their clients' discretion. Hence, payment can come in any form, even a gift, and as long as there is a payment, the birua would remain content. Origins It was claimed that there was, initially, only one shaman, known as Samguan, an effeminate man, and it was him that formalised shaman-ism within the Puyuma. Samguan's elector birua loved him so much that he did not suffer what most of the successive shamans suffered prior to his investiture. His investiture process was, in fact, an interesting one. He claimed that while he was ploughing the fields, his birua dropped a bag (that he proceeded to use as part of his yaulas rituals) from the sky and it landed close to his feet and thus accepted his role as a pulingaw the moment he picked up the bag. Today, pulingaws carry an exact replica of this bag (also known as an aliut) everywhere they go. It was mentioned that prior to Samguan's existence, there were only miapali, who were known as people 'with the evil eye'. These people were often feared and are expected to socially confine and isolate themselves from the rest of the society, to prevent any form of contact (mostly visual). Although people who associate themselves with the supernatural such as the miapali have existed for a long period of time, it was rather surprising to note that formalised ritualistic practitioners as the pulingaws did not exist until the end of the 19th century as Samguan was only 25 when the Japanese arrived in Taiwan in 1895. This claim, at some extent, caused a number of debates amongst the shamans in the past as some pulingaws do believe and claim that another pulingaw known as Udekaw should be considered as the first shaman instead. The reason behind Samguan's well- attained status could most likely be due to his contribution in preventing the Japanese administration in Taiwan from completely annihilating the tribe's shamans and their practices. His intervention was perhaps not conducted directly against the Japanese administration in the form of a confrontational war, but rather in the form of secret gatherings and classes. It was through these gatherings or classes that Samguan conveyed his knowledge to the next generation of pulingaws. In order to suit their practices to the environmental contexts then, the pulingaws would have to be constantly aware of their surroundings and avoid getting caught by the Japanese. For example, in order to avoid being caught by the Japanese, rituals such as the pualasakan would only take place once a year whenever but before that, these rituals took place whenever or wherever there were small issues like illnesses. Selection Electing ancestors (kinitalian) were said to visit their selected candidates through various ways and eventually have these candidates go through investitures that make them official pulingaws. Electing ancestors would in some instances select individuals based on personal preference but these individuals must be descendants of the electing ancestor. Once selected (prior to their acceptance of the role), these candidates would often succumb to various experiences ranging from extreme physical pain that cannot be cured through modern means of medication. Others have also complained of severe headaches and for female pulingaws, some even complained that their kinitalians were so relentless that their (kinitalian) fury had caused the women to have miscarriages. These troubles may in some instances, also be afflicted upon the candidates' families, especially when the birua is annoyed or furious at the candidates for refusing their fate. Thus, in other words, selected pulingaw candidates cannot refuse their calling and they must reveal their biruas calls. Once these candidates have accepted their fate of becoming a pulingaw, life for most pulingaws were often said to be better as their kinitalian no longer disturb them and provide them with blessings. However, there are also exceptions where candidates accepted the role but suffered misfortune events and in some instances led to their deaths. These resulting misfortunes were often associated with the pulingaws' reluctance to fully commit themselves to their pulingaw calling by either abandoning their faith or more importantly, refuse to partake in the annual pualasakan ritual. As a result, they were punished by their kinitalian through a series of calamity. Male pulingaw stereotypes Prior to the Japanese's arrival, the Puyuma tribe had a strong hunting culture and being part of hunting activities was often seen as a masculine role that most males are expected to partake in. However, effeminate males, also known as a fortiori, who do not partake in tribal hunting activities would often turn out to be pulingaws. These effeminate male pulingaws are in a way similar to the Samoan concept of fa'afafine, and some of them do in fact have children. The concept of homosexuality never existed within the Puyuma community and male pulingaws are still seen as men that would fulfil the appropriate gender roles when it comes to having sexual relations with another person, which would be women.Cauquelin, J. (2004) The Aborigines of Taiwan; The Puyuma: from headhunting to the modern world. RoutledgeCurzon, London Considering the fact that the concept of pulingaws is rather new, previous effeminate men were perhaps classified as miapalis as they did not fit in well with social expectations. They were also, perhaps, considered as mialigu, who has the power to become or even make things around them become invisible. Hence, both miapali and mialigu were believed to be part of the social concepts that traditional Puyumans used to reject individuals that do not seem to meet societal expectations or predisposed Puyuman gender roles. This would, however, require more studies to confirm the existing questions regarding such claims. There is another possible explanation for the current state of female- dominated pulingaw practices. The Puyumas were previously a shaman-hunting society where men were in charge of shaman rituals and hunting. Eventually, as Puyuman men focused more on agricultural practices (considered a shameful practice for men), they left the shamanistic practices to mostly women. This social demographic change eventually became permanent during the Japanese administration when hunting was forbidden.

Apart from casual drinking, Aila is an important part of festivals in Nepal. This liquor is usually homemade and prepared by traditional methods. Its preparation is not yet commercial in Nepal, however it is sold in restaurant that serve Newa cuisine. It is about 60% alcohol and can be bought in local Newari restaurants . CNN has noted it as being one of the \\"50 most delicious drinks in the world\\". Preparation Aila is usually prepared by Newari people before any festival or socio-cultural event. Rice along with many other ingredients is mixed with Marcha, a local organic fermenting compound, and fermented at least four to five days to ensure the preparation of a good quality Aila. Millet is used instead of rice for an even stronger flavor. The final product is obtained after distillation. This is done by using traditional clay and brass vessel designed specifically for this purpose. The raw fermented mixture is cooked over a wood fire stove. Temperature of flame and cooling water are the two factors controlling the quality of this beverage during distillation. Religious significance Consumption of alcohol is not just allowed but generally encouraged in Newari culture. This is a religious practice promoted by Tantric traditions. According to the Tantric practices, foods are divided into three groups: mamsa (meat), matsya (fish) and madya (alcoholic beverages). It is believed that offering alcohol would satisfy the Tantric gods who in turn grant followers good luck. Aila is first offered to the gods before every religious festival and cultural activities, and then it is served. One such famous Newari festival is Yenya.

The common theme of her fundamental research includes investigations of free-surface gravity water waves and bluff-body boundary layer physics. Combining fluid dynamics and elasticity is one goal of the research but the understanding and the predictions of the fluid dynamics itself tend to represent the main challenges. The moving boundary treatment and bubbly fluid flow behavior in high Reynolds number and Froude number flows are the primary questions to address. Driven by contributing to the understanding of the underlying physics of turbulence and wave breaking, Prof. Frandsen investigates the suitability of numerical approaches spanning a wide range of length scales from micro to macroscopic flow structures in highly nonlinear flows. The continuum- and mesoscopic approaches explored include discretization of fully non-linear free-surface potential flow -, Navier- Stokes - and Lattice Boltzmann equations (LBE). Her early work on water wave mechanics was carried out in the Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford where she held a departmental lecturership concurrently with her research fellowship at Oriel College. Later, she has earned worldwide practical, educational and research experiences. Among other contributions, she has developed and shown that nonlinear water waves can be captured accurately using various approaches rooted in the LBE. Frandsen has further contributed to the understanding of free-surface dynamics via physical tank experiments and numerical modeling of e.g., slosh dynamics. In recent years, she has conducted large scale wave flume experiments with application to coastal protection working on the understanding of the underlying mechanism of wave breaking and wave impact processes. Large scale (1:2) wave impact on vertical wall with/without parapets (2015) in INRS facility. To investigate the physics of aeroelastic phenomena, she has measured and modeled the coupling effects between fluid flow and elastically suspended bodies undergoing large movement in high Reynolds number. Fluid flow interaction with large structures often lead to resonance problems known as Vortex-induced vibrations, as represented in the first full-scale records on a long-span suspension bridge. Prof. Frandsen has been involved in solving many vibration problems including the development of coupled solvers between fluid and structure, e.g., using tuned liquid dampers to suppress wind induced oscillations. Underpinning her academic experience, she has analysed and designed Offshore Oil and Gas Installations in seas worldwide estimating forces of ocean waves, buckling resistance, etc. She has also been engaged in offshore wind power and wave energy farm developments with a focus on establishing meteorological and oceanographic conditions in relation to design basis, amongst others. She has estimated wind load on many structures including tall buildings, suspension bridges, topsides on offshore platforms, solar plants, etc. Subsequently she has set-up physical models and field experiments, analysed and assessed the structural dynamics and provided solutions to Vortex-induced vibration (e.g., Great Belt East Bridge) and earthquakes.

This browser game was launched in 2002 and it's still active today. The goal of the game is different from manager to manager. It can be to have one or more players in a national team, to aim for league or cup glory, or simply to achieve stability by raising and training players properly. The user defines its own goals. However, one can say Planetarium Manager is all about starting from the very bottom and achieving planetarium success.  First version  Planetarium Manager was created in Portugal, in the beginning of 2002 by Bruno Pereira (aka ixnay), and its first version was publicly released in April of that same year. This first version was only available to a small number of users because it was made without any commercial purposes. The goal was for pure fun and a test to the creator's programming abilities. The only countries represented were Portugal and Brazil because the game was then only available in Portuguese. Despite its small capacities back then (only 40 teams, divided by 4 divisions), the game rapidly gained some hardcore fans, a lot due to the active IRC community and the very active game forum. Those fans, with their never ending criticism and support, helped the game evolve a lot in its first months and achieve a fairly reasonable reputation and gaming level. During this fast evolutionary period, the need for more staff members arose. By July 2002, 2 new elements joined the creator of the game in administration and programming tasks: Pedro Campos (then known as Bios_Doom, now aka aenariel) and Carlos Reis (aka char). Despite the increasing popularity of Planetarium Manager during the next few months, and partly due to it too, the Admin Team gained conscience of the various technical limitations the game had. These limitations caused the game to reach its maximum capacity at 112 available teams, with several hundred users in the waiting list. The lack of financial resources were also a brake to the game's evolution because it then was in need of a new server with increased capacity to respond to the growing daily activity of the game. Around July 2003, PManager's web server provider blocked the site due to the enormous amount of resources it was consuming. The company responsible for the maintenance of the web server stated then that PManager was harming other company clients, and so breaking one of the provider's essential rules. This forced the website offline for a period of about two months, because it was only after that period of time that the Admin Team was able to retrieve the game's main databases from the provider. But not everything was bad. This unpredictable stop gave some time for the Admin Team to re-think and re-evaluate some of the main limitations and general problems of the game. During this period the Team decided that the development of a second version, entirely coded from scrap should begin and the 1st version abandoned; this second version would solve many problems, and its major changes would be the availability of the game in several different countries and languages. This new version would also have, for the first time ever, commercial purposes.  Second version  The development of the second version took a very long time, given the voluntary status of its programmers. The server used to test the game was an old computer and the main programmer, coded almost everything using remote access to the test server and his own personal computer, then with limited internet access. The making of PManager's 2nd version can be easily compared to the making of some of the most successful old computer games like the early Championship Manager series or other famous games from the 1980s and 1990s, directly from the programmers' basements or attics. In October 2004 the second version of Planetarium Manager was finally released. The game was an immediate success, surpassing all the creators' expectations. Which were quite low then and not higher now. It had an exponential growth in the first months after its release, before finally finding stability at around 10,000 users, spread over 48 different countries.  Third version  The third version of the game, after several months of development and extensive testing, was released on 6 March 2006, roughly 1 and 1/2 years after the release of the second version and almost four years after the release of the first. Its main improvements were mostly related to the graphism of the website, but a lot of new features and corrections were also be introduced. With this new version the main objective of the Admin team was definitely to prepare the game to grow even more, to stabilize the services offered, to correct old problems and to make room for further addition of even more new features. This has been partly fulfilled in the few months after PM3's release, with the addition in July 2006 of six new countries and other several available languages.  Fourth version This fourth version came out in December 2008 and with it came a new website design. Also new features were introduced to the game, such as a new staff system, introduction of player happiness, new advanced tactics for the Match Engine, new league system and the possibility to bid players that are not in the transfer list. PManager Screenshot  Today  The game has about 67,800 users, a very active forum community, a fairly complete help archive available and an Admin Team always ready to answer questions and hear the users' suggestions. After this fourth version, Planetarium Games has developed four more MMOGs, three of them sports related.

London: Oxford University Press. p. 100. see also californiabirthindex.org and old time birthdays for August for verification of birthdate – April 11, 2013)The Mudcat Café, R.I.P. fiddler Sue DraheimNews of Sue Draheim's passing reached across the Atlantic; fRoots, a UK monthly music journal, reported the news immediately (see Sue Draheim RIP ), and an article memorializing her appeared in The Independent, a major UK newspaper (see: Hunt, Ken (29 May 2013), Sue Draheim: Widely admired folk violinist). An obituary article for Draheim appeared also in Folkwales, an on-line journal based in Wales. That she was appreciated and loved outside the English speaking world is indicated by a tribute to her (including a link to a recording of her playing Little Sadie) on the Spanish language blog of Yesternow, a radio station originating in Madrid (see \\"...ese gran sonido al violín de Sue Draheim. Descanse en Paz.\\"). was an American fiddler, boasting a more than forty year musical career in the US and the UK. Growing up in North Oakland, Draheim began her first private violin lessons at age eleven, having started public school violin instruction at age eight while attending North Oakland's Peralta Elementary School. She also attended Claremont Jr. High, and graduated from Oakland Technical High School in 1967. Originally trained as a classical violinist, Draheim became involved in many other genres and recorded albums with groups representing Cajun, Old Time, country, Zydeco, folk jazz, Irish and British folk music. Early on in her career, Celtic fiddle became Draheim's major focus. While Draheim was primarily a fiddler, she never lost touch with her classical training, and was a member of the Berkeley Symphony Orchestra and the Bay Area Women's PhilharmonicYoung Fogies Gazette, Sue Draheim biography (scan courtesy of Susie Goehring, Field Recorders Collective) as well as UC Berkeley's University Chamber Chorus;UC Berkeley, Dept. of Music - Past Performances, University Chamber Chorus Draheim, along with fiddler Kerry Parker, also \\"augmented\\" the harp trio \\"Trillium\\".San Francisco Early Music Society - Three Harps and Two Fiddles... She also played in the US premiere of Frank Zappa's experimental orchestral piece A Zappa Affair.Berkeley Symphony Orchestra - A Zappa Affair She was described by Gael Alcock, cellist/composer with whom she performed one of Alcock's pieces, as \\"fiddler extraordinaire\\".gaelalcock.com - \\"Minor Excursions\\" Late 1960s to early 1970s in the US In the late 1960s, Draheim moved to a North Oakland house well known in the Bay Area music community and called simply \\"Colby Street\\". This move proved to be a decisive one in terms of her musical career as it was where she changed from a \\"violinist\\" into a \\"fiddler\\". In writing her short biography in 1970 to accompany the album notes for Berkeley Farms, Draheim gives us some background on that transition: Draheim quickly got involved in American mountain string band music, forming a group called the \\"Diesel Duck Revue\\" in 1967 with Mac Benford, Hank Bradley, Sue Rosenberg, and Rick Shubb,Smithsonian Folkways - liner notes for BERKELEY FARMS, p.5 performing with them at Berkeley's Freight & Salvage in 1968.chickenonaunicycle.com - Freight and Salvage At about the same time she started playing with a Colby Street group that, when she performed with them at the Sky River Rock Festival (Tenino, Washington in 1968 and 1969), called themselves \\"Dr. Humbead's New Tranquility String Band and Medicine Show\\". The band consisted of Sue Draheim, Jim Bamford, Mac Benford, and Will Spires and owed its name to their manager and sound man Earl Crabb (aka \\"The Great Humbead\\"); by the time Mike Seeger arranged for them to be recorded for the Folkways Berkeley Farms album in 1970, they'd shortened the charming but cumbersome name to simply \\"The New Tranquility String Band\\".Malone, Bill C. (2011). Music from the True Vine: Mike Seeger's Life and Musical Journey. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press. p.153. Performing with the band, her photograph appeared on the poster for the 1968 Berkeley Folk Music Festival. Draheim and Dr. Humbead's New Tranquility String Band also appeared at the 1969 Third Annual San Diego State Folk Festival; links to recordings of their performance there are provided on folkartsrarerecords.com's website.folkartsrarerecords.com - (links to 1969 recordings of Dr, Humbead's New Tranquility String Band): Sally in the Garden, Goodbye Liza Jane, Flying Clouds, and Bully of the Town. Colby Street housed other groups as well, one of them being the \\"Golden Toad\\", featuring mandolinist and guitarist Will Spires; she joined them for the summer solstice concert at Grace Cathedral in 1970. In 1970, Joe Cooley, Irish button accordion player who was living in San Francisco at the time, visited the Colby Street house and that was the beginning of Draheim's lifelong attachment to Irish music. She and others joined Cooley to perform Saturday nights at San Francisco's long-standing Irish pub, the Harrington Bar, making up the band which they called \\"Gráinneog Céilidh.\\"Will Spires p.4, see also Sue Draheim pp. 4-5A note on the origin of the band's name: Gráinneog Céilidh translates literally as Hedgehog Party. The word céilidh has become more specifically associated with Irish dance bands, practically all of whom include Céilidh (or Céili) Band in the final part of their names (see Modern ceilidhs and The Ceili Bands of the 60's and before ). A gráinneog (hedgehog) is a much maligned creature in Ireland (see The Folklore and Traditions of The Irish Hedgerow) and has a reputation for being dirty and unkempt; Joe Cooley may have had the somewhat ragged appearance of the Colby Street people in mind when the name was suggested but, having a friendly little joke at their expense, admitted only that the hedgehog was \\"just the warmest, furriest little creature\\" (see The Joe Cooley Tapes). (Special thanks to Jody Stecher for the story behind the name). Years later, Draheim's command of the Irish folk music idiom as well as her versatility in other genres would prompt one fan to comment: \\"And that is a very apt illustration of the point: Sue Draheim, a classically-trained violinist who has been mistaken for a real-deal Sligo fiddler who nowadays has a chair in a San Francisco symphony orchestra as well as playing in old timey bands\\".Mudcat Café - the UK folk revival in 2010 In 1970 Draheim also got involved with several musicians at what was known as Sweets Mill Music Camp, about 200 miles east of Oakland on the edge of the Sierra National Forest. It was there that she played with legendary Delta blues guitarist Sam Chatmon in a group called the \\"California Sheiks\\" (named after Chatmon's back-home group, the \\"Mississippi Sheiks\\". Some recordings of Draheim and Chatmon from that period are known to have survived: one, a 7-inch mono tape reel holding eighteen songs and labelled \\"Box 3, Item 2007.04sdff070\\" in the UCLA Ethnomusicology Archive (which misspelled her name as \\"Drahiem\\"),UCLA Ethnomusicology Archive (Lou Curtiss San Diego Folk Festival Collection 1962-1987) - Box 3, Item 2007.04sdff070: Sweets Mill Music Camp - The original musical meeting of \\"The California Sheiks\\" 1970 and the other, one song (which is not found in UCLA's collection) which was released in CD form in 1999 as part of a Sam Chatmon retrospective.discogs.com - Sam Chatmon 1970-1974 Early to late 1970s in the UK From late 1970 to early 1977 Draheim lived in England, where her talents as a fiddler soon became so well recognized that Austrian music journalist Richard Schuberth:de:Richard Schuberth counted her among the \\"crème de la crème of the English folk-rock scene\\".(original: \\"die Crème de la Crème der englischen Folk-Rock-Szene\\") She brought with her a background of US genres of folk music which blended well with the British folk-rock scene. In one case at least, her influence on the British music scene rebounded to have an effect on the US music scene: American guitarist and author of several instructional manuals Duck Baker wrote that he had learned the Peacock Rag from John Renbourn \\"who would have gotten it from Sue Draheim\\".Baker, Duck (2011). Encyclopedia of Irish and American Fiddle Tunes for Fingerstyle Guitar. Pacific, MO: Mel Bay Publications. p. 97 , Draheim had begun her association with John Renbourn in 1971, and joined the John Renbourn Group, cutting the album Faro Anniesample of Draheim's work on Faro Annie (track № 4) \\"Little Sadie...con ese gran sonido al violín de Sue Draheim. Descanse en Paz.\\" with John Renbourn, Keshav Sathe, and Jacqui McShee in 1972. Impressed by Draheim's old West Clare style which she'd learned from Joe Cooley, John Renbourn observed: \\"I found out more about Irish music from Sue than I could ever have imagined.\\"Collaborators (Sue Draheim) johnrenbourn.co.uk That same year she also performed on Henry the Human Fly, an album by songwriter and guitarist Richard Thompson. 1972 was a busy year for her as she and John Renbourn worked together with Wizz Jones to produce Wizz's album Right Now, in addition to recording albums with Scottish folksinger Marc Ellington. In 1972, Draheim debuted live with the then unknown Albion Country Band.\\"Albion\\" The band (sometimes known as Albion Mk 1,steveashley.co.uk. - Steve Ashley - musical biography and described by Spanish film and music critic Antonio Méndez as being \\"traditional British folk with an electric infusion\\"), appeared on John Peel's BBC Radio 1 program called \\"Peel Sessions\\" which introduced up-and- coming musicians. In June 1972 Draheim and the Albion Country Band also recorded and had broadcast a piece (Four Hand Reel/St. Anne's Reel) for the BBC radio show called Top Gear,mainlynorfolk.info - Ashley Hutchings: The Guv'nor Vol 1 which also featured contemporary musicians; the recording was later released in 1994 on Ashley Hutchings's compilation The Guv'nor vol 1.

(2002). International Who's Who in Popular Music 2002. London: Europa Publications. p. 18. Just before leaving the UK to return to the US in 1977, Draheim recorded again with John Renbourn to produce the album A Maid in Bedlam.\\"Ruhlmann, William, A Maid in Bedlam - review, Allmusic.com\\" Late 1970s through the 1980s in the US In late 1977 she returned to Oakland where she joined the all-women group Any Old Time String Band\\"Any Old Time\\" Northern California Bluegrass Society and recorded two albums with them, Any Old Time String Band and Ladies Choice. Both albums were re-released in 1996 by Arhoolie on a single CD titled \\"I Bid You Goodnight\\". One of Draheim's hallmarks was her eclecticism, and the first half of the 80s found her recording with a variety of artists including ethereal, new wave pagan/wiccan Gwydion Pendderwen, the more solidly traditional Cajun and country Delta Sisters,Thomson, Ryan J.

Additionally, during the 1990s nearly a dozen retrospective compilation albums (including three by John Renbourn) were released which featured earlier recordings with Draheim, some of them going as far back as the 1970s (see discography). 2000s In 1999, Draheim joined Golden Bough, a Northern California group which focuses on traditional Celtic folk music. After producing two albums with them which were released in 2000 and 2002, she left the group just two years later in 2001, but still got together to play with them from time to time.jeansmagazines.org - interview with Margie Butler of Golden Bough Joining Craicmore, a group which describes itself as \\"a contemporary traditional Celtic band\\",craicmore.com - The Band Draheim released an album with them in 2002.

Appraisal of Draheim's work with Tempest included such comments as: \\"The addition of Sue Draheim (Jon Renbourn Group and Sorbye's other unit, Caliban) has added an extra, deeper and (again) more relaxed dimension to the Tempest sound.

Later in 2004 she worked with the young singer Michael Bannettmichaelbannett,com - Michael's Recordings to produce an album featuring a collection of British Isles songs from the 17th to the early 20th centuries. Draheim got together with Golden Bough again in 2006 for a 25th anniversary reunion concert, which resulted in an album release of traditional British folk music. Moving into a different genre altogether, Draheim joined \\"Hiss Golden Messenger\\", which has been described as \\"alternative country\\" and \\"country rock\\", to produce an album in 2009. An Arhoolie Records retrospective was released in 2013, including some of Draheim's earlier recordings with them, but Draheim's last new release was in 2011, a live recording with Southern country blues singer and guitarist Wayde BlairWayde Blair's albums include Short Term Memoirs, Kentucky Windage, Live at the Art House, Kentucky Lucky, and Swing with Western. at Berkeley's Art House.

The word translates to \\"Fasting Night\\" in English. The tradition is to eat the very best foods, which are part of the German tradition, and much of them, before the Lenten fast. Fastnachts (pronounced /ˈfastnaxt/in German) are doughnuts. There are three types of Fastnachts, one made with yeast, one made with baking powder, and one made with potatoes and yeast. All are slightly crispy on the outside and not as sweet as standard doughnuts. History Traditionally, fastnachts are made to use up the lard, sugar, butter, eggs and other rich foods in a house before the austere diet of Lent begins. In Catholic and Protestant countries, Fastnacht Day is also called \\"Fat Tuesday,\\" or \\"Mardi Gras,\\" a name which predates the Reformation and referred to the Christian tradition of eating rich foods before the Lenten fast began. In some South American countries, the day is associated with Carnival, a festival of dancing, drinking and debauchery. \\"Carnival,\\" which is the English spelling, derives from the words \\"carne levar,\\" or \\"meat takeaway,\\" another Lenten tradition. Fastnacht can also be spelled in various ways, such as \\"fasnacht\\", \\"fassenacht,\\" or \\"faschnacht.\\" The word \\"fastnacht\\" means \\"the night before the fast,\\" since the doughnuts are eaten the night before Lent, when fasting is usually observed by many Christians until Easter Sunday. Making and eating fastnachts was a way to consume all the fats, such as butter and lard, kept in the house pantry, as these rich ingredients were seen as lavish and were not supposed to be eaten during the Lenten season. Traditional celebrations One popular recipe is the one that calls for mixing the dough with mashed potatoes, which gives the yeast raised fastnachts a flavor all its own, not be confused with commercial donuts. Since Pennsylvania Dutch farm families were quite large, when the \\"Haus Frau\\" (housewife) began to fry the raised fastnachts in her warm kitchen the tantalizing smell of these raised donut- like cakes lingered throughout the farmhouse. Naturally, the wiser members of the family were awoken, and realized that if they got up early they could share in Mother's fastnacht treats. But the less wise ones or lazy ones may have continued in their slumber, while the siblings enjoyed fresh fastnachts with a beverage. The last person up on Shrove Tuesday was called the \\"Fastnacht\\" and kidded all day long for being late for this wonderful breakfast. In the same way, the last person up on Ash Wednesday was also teased, and called the \\"Ashepuddle\\", whose chore for the day was to carry the ashes in the stoves and ovens outside to the ash pile. Fastnachts were a winter staple of the Dutch housewife and could be eaten long past Ash Wednesday, even though originally fried in pork lard, the day before Lent. Shrove Tuesday fastnacht baking was a way of life in which the Pennsylvania Dutch people celebrated its ethnicity, more than going to church; it was a folk-life practice that was more personal. These yeast raised cakes had been rolled out and then cut into squares, triangles, or rectangles to rise near an old cast iron kitchen stove. Older Church congregations in the East Penn Valley still have Fastnacht Church Socials or suppers in which natives gather for fellowship, enjoying their Pennsylvania Dutch heritage. In today's time several large corporations are also producing fastnacht doughnuts in a unique way. The substitution of coke in for the milk or coffee of the original recipe; it gave the doughnut a special/unique flavor. This was later to become the Coca-Cola recipe of the fastnacht doughnut. Traditionally the fastnacht didn't have a hole in it, it was cut, or slit, through the middle (like a bagel) to allow air and the placement of condiments such as jelly, and butter. Some cultures add molasses (king syrup) or \\"Turkey Brand\\" syrup to enhance the flavor. Recipe Recipe #1:Fastnachts with baking powder 3-1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 3/4 teaspoon ground mace (can use nutmeg) 1/4 cup solid vegetable shortening (use lard if you can get it) 1 cup granulated sugar 2 large eggs, beaten 1 cup milk vegetable or canola oil for frying, about 2 quarts Place the flour, baking powder, salt and mace in a medium bowl. Stir with a wire whisk to combine. Set aside. In a large bowl of an electric mixer, cream together the shortening and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs and mix until creamy. Gradually add the dry ingredients, alternating with the milk, mixing on low speed, just until well- combined. Place on a floured board. Work the dough lightly with hands, adding a little more flour as needed if it is too sticky. (This dough should be very soft, something like a biscuit dough, so don't add more flour than necessary.) Gently roll the dough into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle or square. Using a sharp knife, cut into 2-inch squares or similarly sized rectangles. Heat the oil in a deep-sided pot over medium heat to 375 °F. Carefully add the fastnachts to the oil, about 6 per batch, and fry until well-browned on one side, about 2 minutes. Flip and brown the other side for another 2 or 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a baking sheet lined with paper towels to drain. Repeat with the remaining fastnachts. Recipe #2: Fastnachts with Yeast 2 cups scalded milk, ½ cup lard, 1 cup mashed potatoes, 2 teaspoons salt, ¾ cup sugar, 2 well beaten eggs, 1 package yeast, 7 cups flour, approximately Scald milk and add mashed potatoes, sugar, salt, and lard. Cool until lukewarm. Add eggs. Add yeast and enough flour to make a soft dough. Knead well and place in a greased bowl. Cover with a cloth and let rise about 1½ hours. Roll ¼ inch thick on a floured board. Place on a cloth and let rise until doubled in size and fry in hot fat. Recipe #3: Fastnachts with potatoes and yeast 2 1/2 c. hot mashed potatoes 1 cup milk 3 beaten eggs 2 Tablespoons melted butter 2 cups sugar 2 Tablespoons baking powder 5 cups all-purpose flour In a large bowl combine all ingredients, but add flour slowly. Divide dough in half and roll to 1/2\\" thickness. Cut with doughnut cutter. Fry in deep fat or oil, turning when brown. Drain on paper towels and let cool. Date Fastnacht Day is dependent upon the day of Easter, and Ash Wednesday. Easter Day varies from year to year because of the spring equinox, or full moon, and is usually the last Sunday of the month of March. Fastnacht Day takes place 47 days before Easter Day, on the Tuesday prior to Ash Wednesday.

He has been a faculty member at the University of Arizona since 1986. Impey has done research on observational cosmology, in particular low surface brightness galaxies, the intergalactic medium, and surveys of active galaxies and quasars. As an educator, he has pioneered the use of instructional technology for teaching science to undergraduate non- science majors. He has written many technical articles and a series of popular science books: Einstein's Monsters The Living Cosmos, How It Ends, How It Began, Dreams of Other Worlds, and Humble Before the Void. He served as Vice- President of the American Astronomical Society, he is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor. Impey also serves on the Advisory Council of METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence). Biography Impey was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and spent his childhood mostly in New York and London, attending 11 schools. He got a 1st class honours BSc in Physics at Imperial College of Science and Technology, part of the University of London, in 1977. After an internship working on a neutrino calorimeter at CERN under Jack Steinberger, he went to the University of Edinburgh for graduate school in astronomy. He earned a PhD under the supervision of Drs. Peter Brand and Ray Wolstencroft in 1981. He worked at the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii from 1981 to 1983 as a UK Science Research Council/NATO Fellow, then at California Institute of Technology from 1983 to 1986 as a Weingart Fellow. Impey has been on the faculty of the Department of Astronomy/Steward Observatory at the University of Arizona since 1986, since 2000 as a University Distinguished Professor. He is Deputy Department Head in charge of academic programs, leading the nation's largest undergraduate astronomy majors program, its second largest astronomy PhD program, and one of the largest programs to teach astronomy to non-science majors. Research Working mostly in the fields of extragalactic astronomy and observational cosmology, Impey has over 170 refereed publications and 70 published conference proceedings. His early work was on the sub-class of active galactic nuclei called BL Lac objects, now thought to be highly luminous and variable extragalactic sources where our sightline looks nearly down the spin axis of a supermassive black hole emitting twin relativistic jets. In the 1980s he was a heavy user of the first wave of large optical telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. As a postdoc at Caltech he worked with Greg Bothun at the University of Oregon on the properties of dim and diffuse stellar systems that tend to be missing from most galaxy surveys. Working with the noted Australian astrophotographer David Malin, they discovered the largest spiral galaxy known, dubbed Malin 1. He also continued his thesis work on BL Lac objects, using a travelling polarimeter that toured many of the world's observatories, including Kitt Peak in Arizona, Palomar in California, Las Campanas and Cerro Tololo in Chile, Sutherland in South Africa, and the Special Astrophysical Observatory in the Caucasus region of Russia. He was a heavy early user of the Hubble Space Telescope, getting time in each of the first eight cycles of observation. At Steward Observatory in the 1990s, he studied the intergalactic medium using multiple quasars to probe the three dimensional structure of the hot, diffuse gas in galaxies, which contains as many baryons as the sum of all the stars in the universe. He also studied gravitational lensing using the exquisite image quality and stability of the HST. Over the past decade, he has been a major participant of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS), led by Nick Scoville at Caltech. He led the spectroscopic follow-up of active galaxies and quasars selected by their X-ray emission, with a goal of charting the growth and fuelling rate of the massive black holes that are now known to exist in every galaxy. Impey's research has been supported by over $20 million in grants from NASA and the National Science Foundation. Education Impey is a pioneer in the use of instructional technology in the classroom. He was the lead author of the University of Arizona plan for instructional computing in the 1990s and he gave the first invited education talk at an American Astronomical Society meeting. He has been on the editorial boards of the Astronomy Education Review and the Encyclopedia of the Cosmos project, and he has served on the board of directors of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. He is on the International Executive Committee of the Inspiration of Astronomical Phenomena series of meetings. He has written over 40 articles on education, pedagogy, and science literacy. He is the winner of seven teaching awards at the University of Arizona and he has taught over 5000 students, mostly in introductory astronomy classes for non-science majors. He taught part of an astrobiology class in the 3D virtual world called Second Life, and more recently he has taught a massive open online course (MOOC) to over 2000 people using the Udemy platform. Impey is the creator of the web site Teach Astronomy, which has gone from peak traffic of 100 visitors a day after its launch in 2012 to 600–700 visitors a day one year later. Teach Astronomy has a full online textbook, over a thousand short video clips, and it also aggregates articles from Wikipedia, nearly 10,000 astronomical images and over a thousand podcasts. Impey enjoys conveying the excitement of astronomy to general audiences. Several times he has been an eclipse cruise lecturer, and since 2000 he has been a Harlow Shapley Visiting Lecturer and a Smithsonian Associates Lecturer. In 2007, he was a Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar. He has given the Cave lecture at the University of Kingston, the Benjamin Dean Lecture at the California Academy of Sciences, a TEDx lecture in Tucson, and the Robinson Lecture at the Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland. He gives about twenty public talks a year, to audiences as diverse as kindergartners, NASA engineers, and Tibetan Buddhist monks. In 2014, he was named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor, and awarded $1 million to improve undergraduate education. Writing Impey has written a number of popular science books, marked by their incorporation of cutting edge research, and the use of vignettes that place the reader in unfamiliar scenes. The Living Cosmos (2007) is a survey of the emerging field of astrobiology, published initially by Random House and in 2011 republished by Cambridge University Press. Also with Cambridge University Press, he published a set of interviews with leading researchers in astrobiology, called Talking About Life (2010). He has also edited a set of books base on his long-time association with the Vatican Observatory astronomers. He has edited a book on astrobiology based on his long-time association with the Vatican Observatory astronomers, called Frontiers of Astrobiology. He has also edited a book on the ethical and philosophical implications of the search for life in the universe, called Encountering Life in the Universe. With planetary scientist Bill Hartmann, he wrote two introductory textbooks for college-level astronomy, The Cosmic Journey (1994), and The Universe Revealed (2000). On the subject of cosmology, he has written about the origin of the universe in How It Began (2012) and about the long term fate of the universe in How It Ends (2010). With English professor Holly Henry, he has written a survey of the scientific and cultural impact of iconic NASA missions in Dreams of Other Worlds (2013). His most recent book is Humble Before the Void (2014), based on teaching cosmology to Tibetan Buddhists in India as part of the Science for Monks program.

It was originally developed for iOS, where it launched on August 23, 2011, and was subsequently released for Mac, Microsoft Windows, and Android phones. On April 9, 2012, Sony Computer Entertainment of America announced on their blog that a greatly enhanced \\"16-bit\\" version of the game would be launching on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita. The game was originally created as an homage to series designer Adam Rippon's late father, sculptor and professor Thomas Rippon, who died in December 2010. Dragon Fantasy features classic Japanese role-playing game gameplay, including random battles, lengthy treasure-filled dungeons, and a story about a lone hero saving the world. The game features numerous homages to other games in the genre, most notably Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, but also Lufia and EarthBound, amongst others. With the release of Dragon Fantasy Book I and Dragon Fantasy Book II on PlayStation Network, an enhanced mode with updated 16-bit styled graphics and orchestrated audio was added. This enhanced mode may be turned on or off at any time to allow the player to experience the game as either a Nintendo Entertainment System-style or Super Nintendo Entertainment System-style game. The compiled Volumes of Westeria that is available for Nintendo 3DS as of mid-2015, via digital download on the Nintendo eShop, includes this feature as well. Dragon Fantasy: The Black Tome of Ice (Book II), was released on March 22, 2016, for PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 systems. It was released for the Wii U on May 26, 2016.  Plot  Dragon Fantasy Book I features three separate canonical chapters, plus one intermission chapter based on Minecraft. Chapter One, simply titled \\"Dragon Fantasy\\", centers around the character Ogden, who is based on the series creator's father, and focuses on the idea of a washed-up former hero getting back into the business of world-saving. It also sets up many of the characters and themes for the rest of the game. Chapter Two, \\"The Heir Unapparent\\", tells the parallel story of Prince Anders, brother of Prince Marlon, who was kidnapped at the beginning of Chapter One. During his travels, Anders discovers an important artifact that becomes central to the story in later chapters, particularly in the sequel, Dragon Fantasy Book II. Chapter Three, \\"Operation Desert Plunder\\", introduces new characters Jerald and Ramona, a thief and his niece trying to escape the eastern desert empire of Sandheim. They rob a ship that the heroes from the first two chapters are traveling in, and find the artifact found in Chapter Two, to their great peril. Finally, Intermission M features a non-canon side-story about the heroes traveling to a Minecraft server and retrieving Notch's magic Swedish hat from an Enderdragon in order to return to the real world. It was created in honor of the game's first appearance at a convention during Minecon in 2011.  Reception  In addition, RPGamer editor Michael A. Cunningham gave the game a 4 out of 5 (\\"Great\\"), saying that it \\"has the distinct honor of being the first iOS game I've ever felt compelled to play\\".
